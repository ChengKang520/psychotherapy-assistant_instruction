Supervision Miriam Polster, Ph.D. 

00:01:00
[sil.] 

00:01:00
MIRIAM POLSTER Okay. What I like to do in supervision is to remember that, uh, we're talking about two people. We're talkign about the person who is sitting with me who is asking for supervision, and we're talking about the person who sits behind her, if you will, the patient she is presenting or that he is working with. And so there is this double, uh, quality of working with somebody who is seeing another person. And you're, in a sense, trying to respond to what's being done primarily with the person you're supervising, but certainly also with the person who is sitting behind them in, in the office where they work. Uh, so what I like, what I like to do is to focus on the evolution of the supervisee. How that person has grown or what there is that they can learn. What possible things have they not tried that they might like to explore and can they support that kind of exploration? And the, uh, process in supervision, then, is to encourage them and to show them how to support or how to suggest some kind of improvisation, something they might, they might not have tried before. And in some fashion, see to it that they get a sense of what's new and move a little beyond the customary therapeutic boundaries that they have set for themselves or that they assumed were in place when they began to practice. Very often, what you're dealing with when you deal with supervision is the individual's assumptions about how he or she is supposed to p-, behave. And if you can question those assumptions and maybe loosen some of the unique characteristics that the person has, you've done a, I think, a good job. So that what you're looking for is how to sense the uniqueness of the person you're supervising, how to sense whether that person can support or improvise that, from that position, and then to see what happens when in f-, when and how this new direction may be introduced. So that you're dealing with a very complicated evolution that takes place under conditions where another shadowy person is not in your office and not available for you, but their welfare is also connected. So it's, it's a kind of double connection that you have to be responsible for. Um, what I'd like to do is to start by working with one volunteer and then discussing some of what, what the conditions were. And maybe, if we have time, to work with yet another volunteer and see how some of the same things develop or to see if there are different themes that surface and what we may learn about it. And I'd also like to save some time for questions. I assume you use the mic in the middle of the aisle over there, and let's see how we, how we do. Um, one of the first things that I think of in supervising somebody is what are their gifts? What are their talents? What is there in them that is unique and valuable and are they using it? Uh, several years ago, many years ago as a matter of fact, I was teaching a, a graduate course in psychotherapy, and I was asking the graduate students what they considered to be some of their best qualities, their best personal qualities. And they listed things like a sense of humor, uh, a good knowledge of music or art or sports, and a whole range of ther-, of, uh, uh, skills that they had. And I asked them when they walked into the therapeutic office and they closed the door behind them, how many of those skills did they take with them? And what did they add to them? And you would be surprised at the self-censorship that went on. We began to replace some of the uh, qualities that were lively and engaging with qualities like caution, uh, attentiveness, uh, serious purpose, and various things like that that were all worthy, but that also left out some of the loveliest qualities that they had, that would make them unique as a therapist. Because what you do in supervision is to show that individual what's possible without squelching the individuality of that particular individual. So if you happen to know that they know something or they have a certain skill or talent, somehow to find the relevance of that to their function as a therapist, uh, can be one of the most liberating things you can try. So let's see if some of those things apply, and, uh, how that might work in an actual supervision session. Okay? I'm going to lower my hand now and I'm afraid you're going to disappear, but, uh, you know, send me a care package as I've said. Okay. Okay?

MIRIAM POLSTER Hi. Hello. 

00:06:35
WENDY Wendy Schulhoff. 

00:06:40
MIRAM POLSTER Wendy? 

00:06:40
WENDY Yeah. 

00:06:40
MIRIAM POLSTER Good. 

00:06:45
[sil.] 

00:06:45
MIRIAM POLSTER Somebody said these were supposed to be unobtrusive. Don't you believe it. 

00:07:00
WENDY I feel like Madonna. 

00:07:00
MIRIAM POLSTER Oh, really? 

00:07:05
WENDY Well, I would have, would have spent more time on my hair if I knew I was gonna be on camera today. 

00:07:10
MIRIAM POLSTER Ah. Okay. 

00:07:10
WENDY Um, I'm in a rough situation right now in regard to more than just one family, although I'll limit it to one family in just a moment. I'm transfering agencies. I'm a clinical social worker. 

00:07:20
MIRIAM POLSTER You're what? 

00:07:25
WENDY I'm a licensed clinical social worker here in California. 

00:07:25
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. 

00:07:30
WENDY And I'm switching jobs. I'm leaving an agency I've been at for two years and moving on to another one. And I'm terminating with, um, seven families and their children, they're adolescents, m-, many of whom I've worked with weekly for two years. And the context of my interactions with them: these are foster children who are, um, special needs kids who have been identified with psychiatric, behavioral, emotional problems. And I see them in the home. 

00:08:05
MIRIAM POLSTER And what? 

00:08:05
WENDY I see them in the home. 

00:08:05
MIRIAM POLSTER You visit the f-, 

00:08:05
WENDY Not in the, in the office, which lends itself to a very intimate relationship. I mean, I'm, I come and do my visits at their home while they were folding their laundry and making dinner, and, you know, it's, it's a very intimate setting. 

00:08:20
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. You work with the whole family? 

00:08:25
WENDY Well, I, I see the kids alone. I see the foster parents alone. Then I see everyone together. 

00:08:30
MIRIAM POLSTER Oh. 

00:08:30
WENDY Mm-hm. Yeah. 

00:08:30
MIRIAM POLSTER All in their own home. 

00:08:30
WENDY It, not my home, their home. 

00:08:30
MIRIAM POLSTER I said their own home. 

00:08:35
WENDY Yes. 

00:08:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. 

00:08:35
WENDY Yes. Um, and the termination's probably equally difficult for me as it is for them, but, um..., in my 10 years of social work, this is the first job I've had where I've had longterm relationships with clients. My other, all my other jobs, and I'm sure it's no, s-, no, no, um, um, what's the word I want... ? I ca-, uh, I can't think of the word, but, yeah, I worked in a, uh, psychiatric hospital where I saw patients just very briefly. I worked as an emergency psychiatric, uh, assessor, where I would go to the medical emergency room where I would do a one shot deal and say goodbye. 

00:09:15
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. 

00:09:15
WENDY Um, I've had jobs where I worked with patients very, very briefly, and due to my own growth, I think, and my own therapy and all those things, I chose a job where I could have longterm relationships. 

00:09:30
MIRIAM POLSTER Where you would have what? 

00:09:30
WENDY Longterm relationships. 

00:09:30
MIRIAM POLSTER This, which is the job you're just talking about now, that you're leaving. 

00:09:35
WENDY Yeah. Right. 

00:09:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. 

00:09:35
WENDY So over the next week, next, over the next two weeks, I will be terminating with these families. There's several of them who are very, the, the foster parents in particular are very dependent on me. And I'm really in a quandary, I'm s-, I'm, I'm scratching my head, it, did I do something to allow an overly dependent relationship to form? And, I'll focus now on one family in particular: um, there's a p-, a couple that I work with, um, the father is Hispanic, the mother's caucasian; they have two of our foster children and, uh, a nine year-old little girl and a 15 year-old. Um-- 

00:10:25
MIRIAM POLSTER Girl? 

00:10:25
WENDY Girl. They're both girls. 

00:10:25
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. Do they have any children of their own? 

00:10:30
WENDY No. She is, she was not able to get pregnant. Um, they're in the middle of adopting the nine year-old and that loo-, that's gonna go through. We, we, we know that's gonna happen. Um, the foster mother is dysthymic, um, and has s-, very much some dependent personality traits, and calls me at the off-, I see them weekly. She calls me at the office for the, for the least little thing. Um, you know, sh-, she even, my name's Wendy. She calls me "Wen." I mean, I've, only my closest friends call me Wen, except for this foster parent. 

00:11:10
MIRIAM POLSTER It sounds like she calls you "whenever." 

00:11:15
[sil.] 

00:11:15
WENDY That's true. Yeah. It's, that's true. Um, she even called me one time, her, when her husband had suffered a trauma, he was almost car, it didn't really happen, but he was almost carjacked. And she didn't know where to turn. She didn't know what to do. She called me. And that, of course, that has nothing to do with my role, in-- 

00:11:40
MIRIAM POLSTER Yes. 

00:11:40
WENDY --with her family. Um, and she's a, a, good souled woman with a big heart, but her boundaries with the children are n-, are not what I would like them to be. 

00:11:55
MIRIAM POLSTER How old is she? 

00:11:55
WENDY She's about 32? 

00:12:00
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. And what kind of a family did she come from? 

00:12:00
WENDY Um, she's the oldest of three girls, and is very, very close with her two sisters and her parents. Her parents live in the same apartment complex they do. 

00:12:10
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm. 

00:12:15
WENDY Um-- 

00:12:15
MIRIAM POLSTER And yet in an emergency she calls you. 

00:12:15
WENDY In this one case, she did. 

00:12:20
MIRIAM POLSTER Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:12:20
WENDY Yeah. Um, the apartment is, for w-, part of our foster, our agency is, we would go out and we inspect the places these kids live and make sure that they're clean and safe and if there was a fire, people could get out and how this, how this apartment passed that scrutiny, I don't know because it's, it's just deplorable. I mean, it's just, there's just, it's so messy and stuff just crammed everywhere that I, it's, it's-- 

00:12:50
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. 

00:12:50
WENDY It's such a uncomfortable, uh, sad place just to sit in. Um, I mean, I'd be depressed, just b-, be, and she doesn't work. 

00:13:00
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. 

00:13:00
WENDY I mean, I'd be depressed just sitting there all day looking at this mess. Um-- 

00:13:05
MIRIAM POLSTER And yet she does nothing about it. 

00:13:05
WENDY No, she's physically impaired somewhat, she's very, very obese, and she, she's very somatic, very somatic, one of the most somatic people I've ever known. Um, and never feels well. There's always something wrong and that she'll tell me about in great detail. Um, and I guess my biggest concern is some of the things she says to the kids. Um, as I have said, the, the younger child is being adopted and-- 

00:13:35
MIRIAM POLSTER By them. 

00:13:35
WENDY By them. 

00:13:40
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. 

00:13:40
WENDY Yes. And this has been going on f-, they've had this little child in their home for two and a half years. The older child has been in the home for a year and, in just a couple weeks. A year is sort of a magic number to a foster child. Beca-, because after a year they're eligible to be adopted. 

00:14:00
MIRIAM POLSTER Oh. 

00:14:00
WENDY So this older child is saying, "Okay, my little sister's getting adopted. Now I've been here a year. What, what about me?" 

00:14:05
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. 

00:14:10
WENDY And the foster mother's reacting to that with, "You're not fos-, you're not adopt-," how did she word it? "You're not adoption material yet." 

00:14:20
MIRIAM POLSTER That's a very technical way for her to put it. 

00:14:25
WENDY Yes. 

00:14:25
MIRIAM POLSTER How do you account for that? 

00:14:25
WENDY Well, what she said was, um, that this child, this 15 year-old still saw her as a foster parent rather than a family member. And until she could see her as part of a, of her family, she wouldn't be willing to consider her for adoption. 

00:14:40
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. But, but her, her language, the way she put it was, was relatively technical. "You're not adoption material." 

00:14:50
WENDY Mm-hm. 

00:14:50
MIRIAM POLSTER That sounds like, you know, a, s-, what an authority behind her might say, but it doesn't sound like it comes from her. Does it strike you that way? Or does it seem consonant with what you know? 

00:15:05
WENDY Mm. No. It, it, it feels congruent with the way she, she-- 

00:15:10
MIRIAM POLSTER Oh, okay. 

00:15:10
WENDY Way she states things. 

00:15:15
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. 

00:15:15
WENDY The way, it, it, that's how she talks. 

00:15:15
MIRIAM POLSTER Ah hah. 

00:15:15
WENDY Yeah. 

00:15:15
MIRIAM POLSTER That's very interesting. 

00:15:20
WENDY Yeah. And, what my concern is that I'm able to come into the home and take her aside and have the kids go play, and say, "You, you know what, Jodie, that's, that's really, not, i-, the, the, really what we need to remember is that we separate behaviors from the worth of the child. And I know that Susie said something that upset you, but that's not what Susie's about. And that's, you have to be the parent and this is the child. As a parent, your role is to, to, to again, separate the behavior from the child and, you know, be the bigger person. And, um, she cannot withstand hearing that she's not adoption material because she said something to you that upset her." 

00:16:00
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm hm. 

00:16:00
WENDY I mean, it's the same thing as saying to a two year-old, "I don't love you because you're having a tantrum." Uh, and, and, if anyone else had said that to her she would have blown up. I mean, we've-- 

00:16:10
MIRIAM POLSTER If anyone else had said exactly what you-- 

00:16:10
WENDY Because it'd happened. 

00:16:10
MIRIAM POLSTER --said. 

00:16:10
WENDY Yes. 

00:16:10
MIRIAM POLSTER She would have. 

00:16:15
WENDY She only will accept this feedback from me. And examples of that are, um, uh, this, all our children have county workers as well as people like me. And there's one county worker who gave her feedback about a case and, um, she became, she was suicidal over this feedback. She called me up and said she wanted to kill herself. 

00:16:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Oh, boy. 

00:16:35
WENDY Yeah. 

00:16:35
MIRIAM POLSTER That's quite a tantrum. 

00:16:35
WENDY Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. 

00:16:40
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. So what do you do about that? 

00:16:50
WENDY Um..., well, I'm telling her this coming week that I'm leaving the agency and-- 

00:16:55
MIRIAM POLSTER So she doesn't know yet. 

00:16:55
WENDY She doesn't know yet. 

00:17:00
MIRIAM POLSTER Uh huh. What do you predict? 

00:17:00
WENDY Well, I'm trying to pay someone to tell her for me. 

00:17:05
MIRIAM POLSTER Pardon? What? I'm sorry. You were-- 

00:17:05
WENDY I said, I'm trying to pay someone to tell her for me. 

00:17:10
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. 

00:17:10
WENDY And then I thought of leaving the country. Um... um, it's very, very tough because, as I said the, the intimacy i-, in which you have with these people in s-, in seeing, is, you wouldn't think it would be such a big thing seeing them in their home instead of seeing them in an office setting. 

00:17:35
MIRIAM POLSTER I'm not so sure. 

00:17:35
WENDY But it really does change things. 

00:17:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Sure. Sure. It's an invasion of their life. 

00:17:45
WENDY Yeah! 

00:17:45
MIRIAM POLSTER You're on their life territory. 

00:17:45
WENDY Yeah! Yeah! 

00:17:45
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. What would you say to her if you didn't have to be careful? I mean, starting from scratch about your leaving and your concerns, what would you say to her? Without c-- 

00:17:50
WENDY If I didn't have to be careful? 

00:17:55
MIRIAM POLSTER Without caution. 

00:18:00
WENDY Well, I would say some really pretty nasty things about hte job I'm leaving, but there might be someone out there I work with so, I won't, I won't do that. Um, I would just be very frank with her. I would just say the time, the time has come for me to move on to another position. Um, it's a gr-, it's a growth for me, uh, move for me and, um, something that I've been working towards. And I know that it's gonna be a very difficult transition for her, um, but that I know that, that the new worker who's gonna replace me will, will be, um, e-, empathic and helpful and you, you know, I will help as best I can to see-- 

00:18:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Is that, is that true? 

00:18:40
WENDY No, I don't know who's gonna, I don't know who it's gonna be. 

00:18:40
MIRIAM POLSTER That's right. I think you should be very careful to tell her what you know to be true... So what would you say to her if you were just going to tell her the truth? 

00:19:00
[sil.] 

00:19:05
WENDY It's really hard. 

00:19:05
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. What makes it so difficult? 

00:19:10
[sil.] 

00:19:10
WENDY Because out of my own arrogance, I feel like no one can work with her the way I can work with her. 

00:19:20
MIRIAM POLSTER You what? 

00:19:25
WENDY I feel like no one can work with her the way that I can work with her and it's taken two years for me to get to this place. 

00:19:30
MIRIAM POLSTER I see. 

00:19:30
WENDY But I know how to go in the backdoor and get across the information I need to get to her without her blowing up and with her hearing me and ch-, actually changing her behavior. I mean, I can go into the house when the tension is so thick you can cut it with a knife, and work with her and her husband and when I leave everyone's laughing. 

00:19:50
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. So you're, you're pretty convinced-- 

00:19:50
WENDY I mean, I manipulate. I know how to manipulate her. 

00:19:55
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. Well, some people call manipulation influencing. 

00:20:00
WENDY Yeah, there you go. 

00:20:00
MIRIAM POLSTER And it's still the same thing. 

00:20:00
WENDY Yeah. 

00:20:00
MIRIAM POLSTER But, but you know you're doing a good job. There's some, something unique about the job you're doing. 

00:20:05
WENDY I'm very genuine. And what I say comes from the heart. 

00:20:10
MIRIAM POLSTER Yes. 

00:20:10
WENDY And, um, I genuinely care about her and her children. Um, and I think that's the hardest thing about terminating with all the families I'm terminating with. I genuinely care for these kids. 

00:20:25
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. Mm-hm. Okay. Taking all that into account, what would you say to her from that? Whether she's ready to hear it or not? What would you say that would really represent what you're thinking and feeling? This is not necessarily rehearsal to trot right out and do it, but so that you know where you're coming from. 

00:20:50
[sil.] 

00:20:50
WENDY I think I would say, um, I think I would say that it's been very special to me to work with her and her family. 

00:21:10
MIRIAM POLSTER Say. Yeah, say "you" as if you were saying this to her. Because what I noticed is when you started talking that, the tone of your voice changed. It got softer. So, if you could continue, but just as if you were addressing her. 

00:21:25
WENDY Okay. It's hard. 

00:21:30
MIRIAM POLSTER Pardon? 

00:21:30
WENDY It's hard. 

00:21:30
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. Take your time. 

00:21:35
WENDY Okay. Um... Jodie, it's, I need..., Jodie, it's been very special for me working with you and your family, getting to know you over these years. Um, watching, uh, Alisa grow and change in the way that she has with the nurturing you've given her. Watching your patience with Laura. Um, I've learned from you. Um, I've appreciated you welcoming me into your home every week. Um... , I, I know with a little help that you're gonna be able to get through the tough times that wi-, in e-, um, we all know will come as, as they do with working with in-, special needs kids that you have. Um... , but you also need to know that I'm going to be moving on. 

00:22:50
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. Yeah. What are you feeling right now? 

00:22:50
WENDY I want to cry. 

00:22:55
MIRIAM POLSTER Like you feel sad. Could you say that to her? 

00:22:55
WENDY Yeah. 

00:22:55
MIRIAM POLSTER What would you say? 

00:23:05
[sil.] 

00:23:05
WENDY What I want to say I think would be clinically, I think would be unethical. I-- 

00:23:15
MIRIAM POLSTER Well, okay. Maybe the important thing is to get it out, not necessarily, this is not a rehearsal. 

00:23:20
WENDY Right. 

00:23:20
MIRIAM POLSTER You know, for you to go out and do this exactly. 

00:23:20
WENDY Yeah. Yeah. 

00:23:20
MIRIAM POLSTER It's, it's in a sense to see what it is that there is in you that you may or may not express, but that you'd know where you're coming from. 

00:23:30
WENDY Well, I don't want this relationship to end. I mean, I-- 

00:23:30
MIRIAM POLSTER Uh huh. So there's some mutuality there. 

00:23:35
WENDY Yeah. Not just with her, but with most of my foster, most of my cases. 

00:23:40
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. 

00:23:40
WENDY I, like, I want to give them my home phone number, my home address, and if you need anything call, and um. 

00:23:50
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. It's been a big part of your life. 

00:23:50
WENDY Mm-hm. Yeah. It's been the, professionally, it's been the first time in my life where I've had longterm professional relationships with clients. 

00:24:00
MIRIAM POLSTER Yes... And they're leaving it now. 

00:24:10
WENDY Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:24:10
MIRIAM POLSTER So what are you feeling? 

00:24:15
[sil.] 

00:24:15
WENDY I think the hardest thing about it for me is that I think being a foster parent... is, um, and we, I mean, we have a continuum certainly at our agency of, of folks who are more well-suited for the job than others. But most of our foster parents are incredible, incredible people who have, who take children into their homes with tremendous problems that they didn't cause. And they bring them into their home and treat them as their own and try to heal scars that, that they didn't make. 

00:24:50
MIRIAM POLSTER Yes. 

00:24:55
WENDY And I get tearful sometimes just being in their homes watching them nurture these children that are not their own. Um, and watching these children s-, b-, start, start very, very slowly to build some attachment and some of them are not able to, but some of them are, and-- 

00:25:10
MIRIAM POLSTER This is interesting: can you imagine--I've forgotten the woman's name? 

00:25:15
WENDY Jodie? 

00:25:15
MIRIAM POLSTER Judy. 

00:25:15
WENDY Jodie. 

00:25:15
MIRIAM POLSTER Jodie. Can you imagine telling Jodie what she has accomplished in the time that you've known her?... Not merely that you're moving on, but some acknowledgement of what, what she knows now, what she's learned, what she's done that at the beginning you didn't, neither of you knew. 

00:25:35
 Mm-hm. 

00:25:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Was possible. What could you acknowledge about her growth in that period? 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:45
WENDY Her biggest growth of that period has been, um... , the two girls that she has is, that one of them she's had for two and a half years and one she's only had for one year and that's the older one. And I think her biggest growth has been, um, in... learning to set appropriate consequences for the 15 year-old. She was giving her consequences as if, as if she was a nine year old like the other child. 

00:26:20
MIRIAM POLSTER Ah, yeah. 

00:26:20
WENDY And she was willing to listen to feedback from me of what were appropriate and okay behaviors for a 15 year-old. 

00:26:25
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:26:25
WENDY And, and w-, no, you don't do a time out, you know, in the corner for a 15 year-old. I mean. 

00:26:30
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. 

00:26:30
WENDY And she, she listened, she took that in, she integrated it and-- 

00:26:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. 

00:26:35
WENDY --she grew from that. 

00:26:40
MIRIAM POLSTER Yes. Can you say that to her? 

00:26:40
WENDY Yes. 

00:26:40
MIRIAM POLSTER You know, can you tell her what she has accomplished in that time, not just you. How would that feel? 

00:26:50
[sil.] 

00:26:55
WENDY It wouldn't be the first time I've told her that. 

00:26:55
MIRIAM POLSTER No. But this would have a kind of summation-- 

00:27:00
WENDY Mm-hm. 

00:27:00
MIRIAM POLSTER --effect. 

00:27:00
WENDY Mm-hm. 

00:27:00
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. What-- 

00:27:00
WENDY Yeah, I could tell her that. 

00:27:05
MIRIAM POLSTER Pardon? 

00:27:05
WENDY I could tell her that. 

00:27:05
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. How does she react when you tell her what she's accomplished? How's she reacted in the past? 

00:27:10
WENDY She has a hard time accepting compliments. 

00:27:10
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:27:15
WENDY Yeah. 

00:27:15
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. But you could tell her that. How would it feel to you to acknowlege what has happened? Instead of just walking out sadly. 

00:27:30
[sil.] 

00:27:30
WENDY That feels a part of me to acknowledge that. It would be a very genuine gesture. 

00:27:40
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. Yeah. What are you feeling right now? 

00:27:45
WENDY Um, I, I feel that despite every be-, best effort I'm gonna give it and how genuine I'm gonna be and, and how lovingly I'm going to say all of these things that she's still going to, to, that she has, you know, I hate to use DSM kind of lingo, but-- 

00:28:05
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm. 

00:28:05
WENDY She, she, she has some Axis II kind of features and I, I feel like d-, no, despite, however well I do this, and however genuine I do it and how much from the heart it is, that I, to some degree she's gonna decompensate. And I think she'll regroup and I don't think it's gonna be the end of the world, and, um, you know she'll, she'll learn to work with the new worker, but think there's gonna be a time of crisis for her. 

00:28:30
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. Yeah. You look sad again. Yeah. 

00:28:35
WENDY Well, I, I can't make it better. 

00:28:35
MIRIAM POLSTER No... Yeah. 

00:28:40
WENDY And it's a lot for me to take on cuz this is one of seven families. This is, I'm not terminating with one family. I'm terminating with seven. 

00:28:45
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. 

00:28:50
WENDY And this may be one of the harder ones, but it's just kinda all at once. 

00:28:50
MIRIAM POLSTER None of them will be easy. 

00:28:55
WENDY No. 

00:28:55
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. Yeah. Well, what could you say to yourself, Wendy? 

00:29:00
WENDY What I what? 

00:29:00
MIRIAM POLSTER What could you say to yourself? About what you've accomplished. It's been, what, two years? 

00:29:05
WENDY Years, yeah. Oh, my gosh. So much. 

00:29:10
MIRIAM POLSTER Good. 

00:29:10
WENDY So much. 

00:29:10
MIRIAM POLSTER What would it be? 

00:29:10
WENDY I've learned how to relate to children. I, um, uh, um, well, one of my teenagers I, I, um, I often take the, the kids out with me to spend some alone time. And one of my teenagers said, you know, "Wendy, there's something I gotta tell ya." I said, "Well, what is that?" "You know," is what, "the thing I like about you the most? Is you don't even talk like a social worker." 

00:29:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Hm! 

00:29:35
WENDY So. I thought that was a really, really big compliment. 

00:29:40
MIRIAM POLSTER Yes. Yeah. 

00:29:40
WENDY Um, I'm very genuine with the kids. And, and I know that, I can feel it. I can feel they pick up on that. 

00:29:50
MIRIAM POLSTER Can you feel your generosity? 

00:29:55
WENDY Yeah. When I'm with them they have all of me. 

00:29:55
MIRIAM POLSTER Yes. Yeah. Just let that resound a little bit. 

00:30:05
[sil.] 

00:30:05
WENDY It's making me think of, I have, there's a little eight year-old who whenever I'd come over to the house. I've never asked her to do this, but whenever, after she got to know me a little bit she would jump in my lap everytime I would come over to the house. Unsolicited. And, um, I m-, I started tickling her one time and I thought, "Oh, my gosh, this child's been abused and molested." And I said, "I am, Lisa, I am so sorry for touching you without asking you if it was all right." 

00:30:45
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. 

00:30:45
WENDY And she said, "Yeah, you're right. You're on tickle restriction." And she had me on tickle restriction for about six months. Then one day, she jumped in my lap and she said, "You're off restriction." 

00:30:55
MIRIAM POLSTER Ha! 

00:30:55
WENDY And these moments with these kids are just magical to me. 

00:31:00
MIRIAM POLSTER Yes. 

00:31:00
WENDY They're just, they're just magical. I just, you know, with some kids where they've acted, they're acting out all over the place and they have these horrible problems and I look at them and I say, "You know, none of this is the problem." "What do you mean?" "You're mad at your mom." And they start to cry. And, I have to take them alone, spend a ha-, an hour with them, and we, and it's the most poignant moments. It's, um, it's been a very, very special two years. 

00:31:30
MIRIAM POLSTER Yes. You've learned a lot. 

00:31:30
WENDY Yeah. 

00:31:30
MIRIAM POLSTER And is it worth the pain and separation? 

00:31:35
WENDY Yes. 

00:31:40
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. 

00:31:40
WENDY Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:31:40
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. Try again, Wendy, what you might say to, I've forgotten her name again. 

00:31:50
WENDY Jodie. 

00:31:50
MIRIAM POLSTER Jodie. Try again knowing what you know about what the experience was like for you, with the specific memories that you'll carry with you, what would you say to Jodie? 

00:32:00
WENDY Like when I tell her that I'm leaving? 

00:32:05
MIRIAM POLSTER Yes. 

00:32:10
[sil.] 

00:32:10
WENDY I think with her I would... st-, start by saying, oh gosh, it's gonna be so hard. Um... , I need to, Jodie, I need to talk to you about something that's going to be difficult for you... And what you need to know, let me just get, put, put it right out there, is that I'm leaving the agency and moving on to a new job that's, um, gonna be, have more opportunities for me and is a m-, a good move for me. But the negative side is that we're, we're gonna have to say goodbye. And I know that's hard for you, but I, what I'd also like you to know is that it's... maybe equally as hard for me. And, um..., I appreciate, what I said earlier, I, I appreciate, um, you having welcomed me into your home every week for these years; um, watching you work with the children, watch-, watching Alisa be such a happier, more content little girl. Um, I admire your strength. I admire your patience. I've learned from you. Um, I'll miss you. I'll think of you. 

00:33:55
[sil.] 

00:33:55
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. Could you imagine her response? 

00:34:00
WENDY What would her response be? 

00:34:00
MIRIAM POLSTER What her response would be? 

00:34:10
[sil.] 

00:34:10
WENDY I think the fallout's gonna come later. I, I, I think she's gonna be like in shock. 

00:34:20
MIRIAM POLSTER Ah. 

00:34:20
WENDY And, uh, problably won't say much, uh, at all then. 

00:34:25
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. 

00:34:25
WENDY But, um, I think what'll happen is over the next couple weeks, my last two weeks at the agency there'll be crises. 

00:34:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. Okay. 

00:34:35
WENDY That, that will, she'll create. 

00:34:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Yes. Okay. 

00:34:40
WENDY And my gut says I should interpret them for her. That, "Y-, Jodie, I wond-, does this have anything to do with the fact that I'm leaving pretty soon?" 

00:34:50
MIRIAM POLSTER Incredible. Like to give her a handle on it. Mm-hm. 

00:34:55
WENDY Cuz that's sort of her, how she operates. 

00:35:00
MIRIAM POLSTER How what? She operates? 

00:35:00
WENDY She creates crises. Yeah. 

00:35:05
MIRIAM POLSTER This way. Mm-hm. Yeah... Could you point out some alternatives? That she might do something different? That would make the goodbye more, what, acceptable, satisfying? Realistic in a sense. 

00:35:25
WENDY Well, one thing is that, um, the, the little girl who's being adopted, there's several workers they had before me. And they, they're planning this huge party when the adoption goes through where, where, they're inviting all, everyone who's ever worked with this little girl. 

00:35:40
MIRIAM POLSTER Ah. 

00:35:40
WENDY And, um, they, the names of the prior workers are all available at the agency and they, they know they can access, not get their addresses directly, but they can send a letter through the agency saying we're having this party, the adoption's come through. 

00:35:55
MIRIAM POLSTER Right. Mm-hm. 

00:35:55
WENDY And I can remind her that I plan to be there. 

00:36:00
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. 

00:36:00
WENDY That the agency will make me aware when that happens. 

00:36:05
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. 

00:36:05
WENDY Um, as a way of s-, of not making it so final. Like that we'll never see each other again. 

00:36:10
MIRIAM POLSTER Well, completing it in a celebratory fashion. 

00:36:15
WENDY Yeah. 

00:36:15
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. Yeah. What could you say to yourself? 

00:36:20
WENDY What would I say to myself? 

00:36:20
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. 

00:36:30
WENDY Um, to not be so arrogant and to believe that, that, there, there someone else can work with her too. 

00:36:40
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. Yeah. You know what I'm missing in that? 

00:36:40
WENDY What? 

00:36:40
MIRIAM POLSTER I'm missing a sense of how dear some of these people have become to you. 

00:36:45
WENDY How dear what? 

00:36:45
MIRIAM POLSTER How dear some of these people have become to you. 

00:36:50
WENDY Oh, my gosh, yeah! 

00:36:50
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah, but why not acknowledge that... ? It doesn't mean that you'll do anything against the ethos of social work. It means that you know they've become dear to you. 

00:37:05
WENDY Absolutely. 

00:37:05
MIRIAM POLSTER And that you have that capacity. And that it has probably informed some of the most beautiful moments you've had with them. 

00:37:15
WENDY Absolutely. 

00:37:15
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. Can you feel that possession? 

00:37:15
WENDY Yeah. 

00:37:15
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. Now in a sense there's a kind of parallel-- 

00:37:30
WENDY Mm-hm. 

00:37:30
MIRIAM POLSTER --that you have to pay attention to. That is more drastic with Jodie, but is still very painful with you. To know some of the... joy and connection and accomplishment that you've had. It's not antithetical to feeling sad that you're leaving. There, it's a mix. 

00:37:55
WENDY Mm-hm. 

00:37:55
MIRIAM POLSTER It's a mix. And you're entitled to feel that whole mixture. Yeah. And maybe after that a little bit of the excitement of moving on... Right? Yeah. 

00:38:15
WENDY Yeah. 

00:38:15
MIRIAM POLSTER That's what's next. 

00:38:15
WENDY Yeah. It's a good move for me. 

00:38:20
MIRIAM POLSTER Pardon? 

00:38:20
WENDY It's a good move for me. 

00:38:20
MIRIAM POLSTER Yes. Yeah. Would it be okay if we stop there? 

00:38:25
WENDY Yes. 

00:38:25
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. Okay. 

00:38:30
WENDY Thank you. 

00:38:30
MIRIAM POLSTER You're welcome. You're welcome. 

00:38:35
[sil.] 

00:38:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Thank you. 

00:38:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Okay. Oh, there you are. Any, any questions or wishes? It was a very, for me it was a very interesting piece of work because it was a kind of, there was a kind of parallel to it. The, you know, Jodie rearing the two girls and Wendy in a sense rearing Jodie and the two girls. And what happens that way. Um, and the sense of, of, of, uh, one of the difficulties that Jodie has in life is that she doesn't have a good appreciation of what has, in fact, been accomplished. It doesn't nourish her. And th-, that could be a very, uh, infectious process. In other words, Wendy could feel that way, too, because Jodie does. So that it's very important to get a sense of what Wendy's statement is and what Jodie's statement is and how they differ and what might be affected by that. Um, but to be able to do it, if you can with sense of the, um, what should I say, um, the drama behind it, is a very, uh, engaging process. It allows her to get a sense of the dramatic, and of her role in it and to appreciate her role, and also just to touch, because I, it was, oh, boy, it was time to move into some sense of where she was going, the excitement of where she was, in fact, going. Jodie doesn't have that necessarily, although she might. You know, you could speculate that she'll have a little bit of that feeling when sh-, the adoption is legal. There's, you know, some possibility there. But the sense of also, for Wendy, for moving on, for what's next that doesn't frighten her. What's next frightens Jodie, but it doesn't frighten Wendy. And it's important to separate that. Okay? Any questions or observations? Yes? 

00:40:50
MALE QUESTIONER 1 Some supervisors when they work with a supervisee focus almost exclusively on the needs of the patient. And other supervisors, uh, do a lot of work with the supervisee's personality and needs. I noticed that in this case, uh, you affected what I thought of was a, a brilliant balance between the two. The question I have is do you generally work this way, attending both to the personality of your supervisee and of the client, or does it depend on what you sense in the personality of your supervisee? 

00:41:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah, it depends on what I sense in that person, what the, what the struggle surrounds, what it's, you know, what it centers around. So that's, that would be often very influential for me: what the particular circumstance is. 

00:41:50
MALE QUESTIONER 1 Thank you. 

00:41:50
MIRIAM POLSTER You're welcome. 

00:41:50
FEMALE ASSISTANT Excuse me. Would you like to have a hat? There's a gentleman here who would like to offer you his hat so you don't have to put your hand up. 

00:41:55
MIRIAM POLSTER He would offer me what? 

00:42:00
FEMALE ASSISTANT A hat. 

00:42:00
MIRIAM POLSTER A hat? Oh! Well, that would be a nice idea. Will it work? Also, whoev-, who is the next volunteer? 

00:42:10
MAN OFFERING HAT At least you may not have to hold your hand up. 

00:42:15
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. Who am I rooting for? 

00:42:15
MAN OFFERING HAT The New York Knicks. Adjust it... 

00:42:20
MIRIAM POLSTER Okay. Yeah, I see. Oh, this is terrific. Okay! Thank you. It's terrific and that we're photographing this. I love it. Now you see, now you can see how a nice great big grown up therapist behaves. Hi. What's your name? 

00:42:45
STEVE Uh. 

00:42:45
MIRIAM POLSTER I'm sorry, but we're going to have to hurry a little, but. 

00:42:50
THAT'S OKAY. MY NAME IS STEVE. 

00:42:50
MIRIAM POLSTER Steve? Mm-hm. Okay and what, what did you want to talk about today? 

00:42:55
STEVE Well, I am, uh, currently working with a, a woman who has, kind of losing the will to live. And, uh, I've been doing everything I can to try and share with her how important, what, that she's valuable and that she's, uh, a worthwhile person and, um, but I'm not able somehow to engage her, um, in wanting to live. And, she, she is bulimic, and, um-- 

00:43:30
MIRIAM POLSTER How old is she? 

00:43:30
STEVE Pardon? 

00:43:30
MIRIAM POLSTER How old? 

00:43:30
STEVE She's, uh, 51. She's been bulimic since she was 19 when she was in college. And she- 

00:43:35
MIRIAM POLSTER And just managed to skim along the edge and stay alive. 

00:43:40
STEVE Uh, she has managed to do ev-, uh, she's had tests, you know, they do, uh, check the electrocytes and all the, um, uh, different things for years, but she's at the end. Right now her body has broken down so badly, um, and s-, so much that I can s-, and I keep telling her, I have to be really up front with her, I've been trying to anyway, if this is the right thing to do, to let her know how, how close she is to, to the edge and that she is going to die if she-- 

00:44:10
MIRIAM POLSTER How does she take that information? 

00:44:15
STEVE She knows it. And she says, uh, she just told me last week that she wants to just get a gun and end it. And, uh, uh, she was the, the oldest of three daughters and, uh, uh, much was expected of her when she went to college. 

00:44:30
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm. 

00:44:30
STEVE And, and she says that she's never been able to please her family or to, uh, I guess she's just not been good enough in her own eyes. And she currently is staying indoors. She will come and see me very early in the morning. I don't usually do this alone early in the morning, but she'll show up at 6:30 or 6:45 in the morning. 

00:44:55
MIRIAM POLSTER With an appointment? 

00:44:55
STEVE Yes. I make it, I do this just for her. 

00:44:55
MIRIAM POLSTER Okay. Okay. 

00:44:55
STEVE Just because otherwise she won't go out on the street. And, uh, she writes, I have her write out things that are happening to her in her daily life as much as she can. She's fairly well educated. She's very verbal and she's able to use concepts and understand much of what's going on. She's been in all kinds of round, they've sent her around the country for different kinds of therapies and I received her cuz everyone else had given up on her. And, uh, she's just recently, I was looking at her hair and I could see that she's got trychotimania. 

00:45:35
MIRIAM POLSTER I don't know what that is. 

00:45:35
STEVE Uh, she's pulling out all of her hair. 

00:45:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Oh. 

00:45:35
STEVE She's been pulling out all her hair in, and, uh, and she also is shoplifting, uh, she has five items that she shoplifts: uh, bacon, uh, cookies, uh, butter, avocadoes and, uh, I, s-, something else, it's greasy. 

00:45:55
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. I was impressed. Yeah. 

00:45:55
STEVE And we've tried to work on, I've tried to work on that with her about the fact that, uh, not to take her backpack in, not to wear coats that have pockets. 

00:46:05
MIRIAM POLSTER What does she do with the food after she steals it? 

00:46:05
STEVE She eats it. All. And then she-- 

00:46:10
MIRIAM POLSTER Uh-huh, and then purges. 

00:46:10
STEVE And then she purges it, yeah. For feeling guilty about, uh, the shoplifting. 

00:46:15
MIRIAM POLSTER Uh-huh. 

00:46:15
STEVE And, but the, she's to the point where she's actually, her insides are, she's, uh, have suffering. Uh, and she's a very b-, beautiful woman. She's, uh, just go so much expression in her face and I just know that she could do... And, so I've tried to engage her in things like successful things. Like I had her plant a nasturtium seed in her window in her enclosed apartment. 

00:46:45
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. 

00:46:45
STEVE And I had her do a simple jigsaw puzzle of a picture that she would like to look at. 

00:46:50
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm. 

00:46:50
STEVE And I've had her, having her carry a photo of someone that she's loved in her life when she's on, has to go out on the street so that when she's fearful that she'll talk to that photo and try and make herself feel that it's all okay for her. 

00:47:10
MIRIAM POLSTER Those are very inventive activities. That's very clever of you. 

00:47:15
STEVE I have to try and think up things that fit the person. 

00:47:15
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm. 

00:47:20
STEVE Because they're all different. And even the diagnosis to me, I don't understand the diagnoses because these people are normal. They're, they're wonderful people with something that's happened in their lives that's, uh. 

00:47:30
MIRIAM POLSTER Uh, let's not talk about "these people." Let's talk about this woman. 

00:47:35
STEVE Okay. 

00:47:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Continue. Does she have any family? 

00:47:40
STEVE Does she have a what? 

00:47:40
MIRIAM POLSTER Family? 

00:47:40
STEVE No She's never been married. 

00:47:45
MIRIAM POLSTER Uh, sisters or brothers? 

00:47:45
STEVE She has two younger sisters. 

00:47:45
MIRIAM POLSTER Oh! And do they live in the same town as she does? 

00:47:50
STEVE No, they don't. They, they live in, in other cities, but she is in touch with her one that's the next to the oldest to her. 

00:47:55
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. And is that interchange satisfying? 

00:48:00
STEVE They talk. 

00:48:05
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. 

00:48:05
STEVE But the family wants to stay out of it because they've been so involved in her, um, process for so long that they, uh, they s-, keep a distance-- 

00:48:15
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. Mm-hm. 

00:48:15
STEVE --from her. They do invite her for holidays. 

00:48:20
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. And she goes? 

00:48:20
STEVE And she, yeah, she goes, but she feels that she's being punished. 

00:48:25
MIRIAM POLSTER Punished? 

00:48:25
STEVE Yes. She says that being around her parents, she knows that they don't love her. And she knows that she's not good enough. And that being around her sisters, and they're successful and they have good husbands and-- 

00:48:40
MIRIAM POLSTER Oh. I see. Mm-hm. She's 51? 

00:48:45
STEVE She's 51. 

00:48:45
MIRIAM POLSTER She must have been seeing other people before you. 

00:48:45
STEVE She has. 

00:48:50
MIRIAM POLSTER And what was that relationship like? What do you know about it? 

00:48:50
STEVE She says that, um, everybody's been very therapeutic. She can tell you all the diagnoses and explain. She says that I am the first person who is ever willing to, like come in early in the morning. 

00:49:05
MIRIAM POLSTER Ah. 

00:49:05
STEVE And who has, you know, tried to help her find some, something to make her want to live. She said-- 

00:49:15
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. Is she an ethical person? 

00:49:15
STEVE Did she what? 

00:49:20
MIRIAM POLSTER Is she an ethical person? 

00:49:20
STEVE An ethical person? 

00:49:20
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. I mean if you were, think about her, would that word come to mind? Does she do what she's supposed to do? Is she, uh, even-handed in her relationships with other people when they? 

00:49:35
STEVE I, I believe she is. 

00:49:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. 

00:49:35
STEVE Except if, when you're looking at ethical things, when you use that word, then I, the shoplifting isn't ethical, but it's-- 

00:49:45
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. 

00:49:45
STEVE --her only way of, of resolving that awful pain. 

00:49:45
MIRIAM POLSTER What income does she have? 

00:49:50
STEVE Pardon? 

00:49:50
MIRIAM POLSTER What income does she have? 

00:49:50
STEVE What? In the-- 

00:49:50
MIRIAM POLSTER What income? 

00:49:55
STEVE She is on, uh, medicare and medicaid. 

00:49:55
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. Mm-hm. 

00:50:00
STEVE So she has about, uh, I think about 649 a month. She lives in low-income housing. 

00:50:05
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. Mm-hm. I'm, the reason I'm saying that is I'm trying to, to figure out if there's a bargain you could make with her. I mean, like you're willing to come in at 6:30 in the morning. What is she willing to do? 

00:50:20
STEVE And that is a problem. She's willing to write down what is happening after she steals or after different things d-, occur that make her feel bad. And she writes them down beautifully. And she's leaves them in envelopes for me to read. 

00:50:40
MIRIAM POLSTER But is that what, did you ask for that or was that her choice? 

00:50:40
STEVE No, I asked for it. 

00:50:45
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. 

00:50:45
STEVE I a-, I was trying to get her to look at her own writing, to see her own imprint. 

00:50:50
MIRIAM POLSTER Mm-hm. 

00:50:50
STEVE Of what is happening versus her only thinking about it. 

00:50:50
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. 

00:50:50
STEVE Because I was thinking that the thinking isn't doing any good right now. 

00:50:55
MIRIAM POLSTER It's all internal. 

00:50:55
STEVE Mm-hm. 

00:50:55
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. What would you like her to do? Could you give her a humorous assignment? To pay you back for getting up at 6:30. Any time she asks you to get up at 6:30 to see her, what might she do? 

00:51:10
STEVE What could she do? For me? 

00:51:10
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah, what might, what act might she do that would compensate you for that extra early morning rising? 

00:51:20
STEVE I don't, I don't know. 

00:51:20
MIRIAM POLSTER Uh-huh. Make up something. 

00:51:25
STEVE Uh, I may, maybe, we-, I've suggested that she watch some movies that are, have humor and have, uh, feelings of life. And that she could tell me about them 

00:51:30
MIRIAM POLSTER I think, I think you're making the assignments too big. 

00:51:35
STEVE Okay. 

00:51:35
MIRIAM POLSTER I'm aware of the time. 

00:51:35
STEVE Yes. 

00:51:35
MIRIAM POLSTER And I want to move. I think you're making the assignments too big. What about walking around the block? Just every time you come in early, when you're done, she has to go home and walk around the block once or twice. 

00:51:50
STEVE Yes. 

00:51:55
MIRIAM POLSTER And get some exercise. 

00:51:55
STEVE Yes. 

00:51:55
MIRIAM POLSTER Or some other very simple activity like that, something to get her moving, uh, not sitting and contemplating. 

00:52:00
STEVE Right. 

00:52:00
MIRIAM POLSTER Does that feel possible? 

00:52:05
STEVE Oh, yes. 

00:52:05
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah? Would she do it? Well, if she's an honorable woman as you said, she knows you get up early. So she would feel that puts it into balance. 

00:52:15
STEVE She shows up and she would do that, but she doesn't continue to do things. You know, she also has some depression in there with the o-, the-- 

00:52:20
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. Yeah. 

00:52:25
STEVE And so she tends to fall off and then she feels guilty and feels like she's not meeting my expectations. And I agree with you about the assignments being, that's why I tried to do simple things. 

00:52:35
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah, the, uh, uh, no, I think, uh, the planting nasturtium, I thought that was very clever a-, assignment. Just something to, that's small and containable that she can do almost immediately that you could assign to her and keep the bargain even. You know, like you have to, I'm speaking to her now in a sense, not that you'd say this. But what you're, what you want is for her to be at least as invested in feeling better as you are. And it's, if it's honorable to do it by way of saying, "Okay, you maintain the relationship to me by, uh, taking a walk, and I maintain the relationship to you by getting up early to see you at a very, at a more advantageous time. And that's how we keep the bargains honorable. It'd be interesting to see how she would respond to somebody having a claim on her. You know? Because it's, in, in a sense as if she's rejected any, any possibility of people requiring anything of her or giving her anything. Does that feel possible? 

00:53:45
STEVE It is possible. 

00:53:45
MIRIAM POLSTER Could you come up with some assignments like that? I said walking 

00:53:50
STEVE Yeah, I could, but I'm, I guess my biggest fear, and I know that our session's just about over, if not over. 

00:53:55
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. 

00:53:55
STEVE Is that I'm just so, I am worried, and I guess it has to do with myself, about her going ahead and not making it. And it's hard for me to adjust to that feeling. 

00:54:05
MIRIAM POLSTER Oh, yes. 

00:54:05
STEVE That I'm gonna lose her and-- 

00:54:10
MIRIAM POLSTER Yes. 

00:54:10
STEVE I don't, I'm, I'm going to feel a great loss. 

00:54:15
MIRIAM POLSTER She's going to lose herself. She's going to lose herself. You can do everything you want to do. But there are times when you can't save somebody. But you can try. And then not do to yourself what she does to herself. It doesn't help her and it doesn't help you... So if you can get a sense of what your inventiveness might do and invite her to feel better, see how she responds. You know, bulimics, don't they get over it in their later years? Isn't there supposed to be something that-- 

00:54:55
STEVE Uh, if they don't die. 

00:54:55
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. If they live. 

00:54:55
STEVE That's the problem is that she's, her body, there's certain signs that in, and she does go to the hospital, and she has ways of making up for, you know, the binging? 

00:55:05
MIRIAM POLSTER Yes. 

00:55:05
STEVE She tells me she compensates cuz she doesn't really want to die. She just has that feeling that it's, you know, that if it keeps going on like it is, that she has no choice. And I do believe she has choices. 

00:55:20
MIRIAM POLSTER That's right. And you can, you can use those and say, "Okay, if I get up at 6:30 for you, what are you gonna do for me?" And connect her to you. Even if it's indebtedness. Connect her to something that she has to pay. And see what that would do. 

00:55:40
STEVE I will try and do that. 

00:55:40
MIRIAM POLSTER Yeah. Yeah. I wish you luck. I wish you luck. 

00:55:45
STEVE Thank you. 

00:55:45
MIRIAM POLSTER Yes. You're welcome. 

00:55:50
STEVE Thank you. 

00:55:50
MIRIAM POLSTER You're very welcome. That's, that's tough. Not to get caught in a trap like that. Um, you're aware a person's life is more valuable to you than it is to them. It's really murder. But I think, thank you, but I think that, uh, you know some sense of, of what goes on between the two of you in a, in a lively fashion and in an inventive fashion just to take her by surprise in some way, uh, is frequently a very important element in the work. Do you have any questions? And, or observations that some of you would like to make... ? Yeah? 

00:56:40
MALE QUESTIONER 2 I was wondering, I noticed with, um, both of those supervisions that, um, from my point of view, there might have been some personal reasons with both of the people that, m-, that affected them. And y-, it seemed like you tended not to go there. And I was wondering if that was related to the supervision, because it's supervision and not therapy or, or whether you go into peop-, people's, uh needs and feelings, and, uh, on a deeper kind of level too? 

00:57:10
MIRIAM POLSTER No, it's part of the present circumstance. What I try to do when I am working under circumstances like this where it's going to be a one shot deal and we won't see each other again, is I try to make the work as complete and self-contained as I can. 

00:57:25
MALE QUESTIONER 2 Okay. 

00:57:30
MIRIAM POLSTER Not to leave any messy sort of loose ends. Looking towards something that might be done, but not necessarily, uh, moving towards a great step that, that is involved in a sequence of things. Cuz we don't have the luxury of sequences. This is the only time I'm going to be here. So I try very hard to keep it self-contained and yet with principles that might apply beyond the, a single session. 

00:57:55
MALE QUESTIONER 2 Okay, thanks. 

00:58:00
MIRIAM POLSTER Yes. Anybody else... ? Okay. Uh, I think that the use of supervision, the supervisory relationship is a very dear one. Uh, and for us to recognize it and to try to put it in terms of, of a human exchange rather than technical. We used very little technical language and I think that is an extremely important way to do it in the sense of retaining the humanity of the exchange. But the humanity is two-fold: the humanity is that of the person who never comes into the office, the patient who we only hear about second hand, and the therapist who is before us and weighing the decisions and the pros and cons of the relationship that he or she is in right now. And for us to deal with that in supervision is to deal with a double responsibility. To remember, you know, who stands behind the person we're talking with. So for me supervising is always an invitation to try a little differently. To go down a d-, a corner, to turn a corner that hasn't been turned before and maybe discover what's there. And discover in the meantime, some capacity that they might not have known and to move into claiming a little bit more of their own expertise, their own therapeutic authority. And I think that, uh, to work in supervisory capacity is, to me a very satisfying possibility. I enjoy it. I hope you've profited from it too.
