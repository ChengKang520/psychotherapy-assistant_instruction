BRIAN VAN BRUNT Thank you, uhm, thank you so much for having me come out here. I'm, ah, a Jersey boy by, ah, upbringing so anytime I can go back to New York it's, ah, great opportunity to get some pizza and remind myself what food actually taste like, which is nice. Uhm, so before we jump in, uhm, just a couple apologies that the title of the talk had like spelling mistakes in it, they put me from like the University of Iowa which I, I'm not from there, it seems like a nice place but I guess I could be from Iowa, I'm not sure. Uhm, so just, you know, a little adjustment here in terms of what we're gonna talk about today and, uhm, also a bit of a trigger warning. Uhm, some of the topics and some of the things that I'm gonna cover, we're gonna watch some videos and, and talk a little bit more about the idea of objectification, misogyny, deep personalization as it relates to, uhm, mass casualty events and shooting so there are some, uhm, disturbing images that you'll see nothing. I think over the topic you'll seeing anyone being killed or anything like that but it can be kind of jarring so I try to give you a heads up on that. Uhm, and they were kinda crunch for time the last person ran over, uhm, by a lot and I'll be trying to get it together for like a 320 to end so, uhm, we'll do our best to get through and kind over question on as we go. And do you have a copy of books that I'm passing around you up and to look at those if you want some resources, uhm, there's a little black book with a pen you can your, ah, email in there for me and I'll make sure to get you some resources after the talk.

Brian Van Brunt Ending Campus Violence New Approaches to Prevention R Brian Van Brunt HARM to OTHERS The Assessment and Treatment of Dangerousness • This book will be used for student affairs professionals as well as college counselors, psychologists, social workers interested in the practical management of aggression and violence on a college campus. • Ten case studies from both the community and residential college settings provide a comprehensive overview of campus violence and how to intervene to prevent it. 

00:03:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, the two books that I think I drawn most commonly and I again these are being passed around the ending campus violence as well as the, ah, my most recent The harm to others. Really looking at training counselors, clinicians, conduct officers and police had to do what we call threat assessments, talking with student and trying to get an understanding of the potential for violence prior to that violence happening. And this is, ah, really a textbook on how to approach and blend in workplace violence assessments with psychology. So as we talk about these concepts and, you know, with the theme of the conference being related to this idea of violence in it, think we're gonna look at some more extreme cases of violence but for me this all kind of blends back down very directly to just interpersonal conversations the tendency that we have I think to separate out our humanity, what makes us, uhm, people the ability to sit and talk and look at each other and see each other as, as true folks with a commonality, a sense of, uhm, sameness versus pushing that away, uhm, we've seen some great conversations on micro-aggressions, on the tendency to push other folks away based on identities that they have, uhm, I think at the core and if someone asks me for-- related to campus shootings what is one of the biggest issues that we have to get out at front of. It would be this, the idea of breaking down the way the people get on this way of thinking. The idea of rampage violence and why they harm someone else. At the core of that is a separation of the humanity. They see the other person as an object and as a target, uhm, and they often have misogynistic overtones. So we'll look at some cases today to kinda make that point, gonna highlight this, uhm, tendency with the hope that we can get out in front of this kind of stuff. 

00:04:55
Anders Behring Breivik set off a bomb killing eight people in Oslo, Norway before continuing onto Utoya and gunning down sixty-nine youth at a labor party camp on the 22nd of July 2011. He claimed these events were marketing for his 1500 page manifesto outlining a coming war against Muslims. 

00:04:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT The first one I wanna introduce you to if you're not familiar with this Anders Breivik and he is involved in the Norway shooting, uhm, back in 2011. It's an interesting case from, ah, uhm, research perspective it's terrifying in other shre-- other senses but from research perspective because he wrote so much, uhm, he wrote a 1500 page manifesto. His particular beliefs had told him that he was against Muslims, against Islam, and felt like in Norway the political correctness that the diversity their commitment to, uhm, tolerance was at direct odd with his beliefs about the strength, ah, Muslims. He argued that it was like having, uhm, shark in an aquarium of fish and if we don't get them as am out they're gonna destroy all the other fish. So he plan this attack, he set up a bomb in Oslo and fire, fire, ah, after that, after this bifurcated attack in two places. He went to, uhm, ah, Utoya island and at that island kill 69 teenagers which if you let that sink in from over 90 minutes killed 69 people. We don't really have another attack of that magnitude even Columbine, Virginia attack, uhm, third of that, you know, people were killed there. So this is really a devastating attack and one that took an enormous amount of time. I wanna talk about the psychology behind Breivik. Uhm one of the things that we train out when I'm talking law enforcement Homeland security and the FBI is really tying into this idea of costuming and creating a legacy token. And one of the things people do when they push themselves away from others is they have a uniform, they have a way of thinking, they almost like what we would do for Halloween, right. You're all dressed up for Halloween and still you went out there then you, you know, you have kids or friends, the idea of putting on a costume becoming something different for the night. People who think this way and people who move forward through these attacks take this to another level. They assume costumes, will see this theme throughout. They dressed themselves in a certain way to prepare themselves to go through with what they have to go through. People who kill I would argue on a really fundamental level, uhm, just have to overcome the struggle and the struggle at the heart of it is not wanting to hurt another human being so the way we do it is that we depersonalized another human being. We objectify them, they become something nonhuman to us and that allows us to carry out the attack. 

00:07:05
6/22/2011: Andrews Behring Breivik 

00:07:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, Breivik's uniform here he made himself and you might be surprised about that. He was never in the military, so you imagine (inaudible ). He saw himself as a modern day Knights Templar, a Christian cruss-- what-- cruswa-- crusader and put together this, uhm, uniform to, uhm, help I think depersonalizing distance himself from the people he was going to be killing. Same things with this, uhm, just created up, uhm, by himself as well as his, ah, tyvek suit when he was doing the bomb making. All these images, by the way, he put in his manifesto and he shared with us. And I think he shares them with us to really highlight the difference between us and them. So one of the ways we see this difference is in the costuming, uhm, and it comes out pretty clearly here, really seeing himself as on a mission and this idea of being intent-driven and violence becomes powerful here. In other talks I give, I talk about effective violence versus predatory and targeted violence and one of differences is effective violence really is emotion-driven, someone's upset, get a bad grade on a test, don't get the pizza you want, they run out, you-- you're frustrated, you yell at the other person in front of you. Someone doesn't hit the elevator button, you get caught off in the traffic, it's emotional, right, and we're all can relate to that kind of violence. The predatory violence that we 're talking about here which is most common in the objectification or the depersonalization, uhm, things that were talking about today really is driven by intent. Just like the 9/11 attack, right, it's driven by this desire to complete a mission, not a desire to be angry and overwhelmed. It becomes mission-oriented, we'll see that theme develop. This is, ah, Breivik again in his costumes and his uniforms clothe himself prior to the attack, this is Utoya Island where he carried out the attack. You know, in these weren't people he was killing, these were the students of the leading political party in Norway. So it would be like if there was a Republican summer camp that all the Republican center kids do- wherever that-- be like Texas, somewhere. There be one in the-- for the Democrats if we send all of our kids like Martha's Vineyard or something, right. It's that the (inaudible ). So that, that's where he attacked. So again it's not people that he is killing, it's the targets, it's the mission. He is trying to hurt the politicians in power. It's that depersonalization on a large scale place out here. So, him after he was caught. 

00:09:25
• Jared Cano planned to attack Freedom High School and was stopped by an anonymous tipster in August of 2011. Police found fuel, shrapnel, plastic tubing, timing and fusing devices for making pipe bombs along with detailed notebooks and schematics outlining where the bomb would be placed and which administrators would be targeted 

00:09:25
BRIAN VAN BRUNT I wanna talk to you about another case here which I, I find fascinating, uhm, anyone familiar with this case? This is Jared Cano down in Florida. Yeah, it's an uncommon case for people to be familiar with mostly because there wasn't a body count. It was reported, it was stopped before it was carried out, and as I study these cases of violence one of the most fascinating things I come across are cases where everything worked right, if you see something, say something, someone saw something and heard something and said something and stopped it. And that keeps it from heading front page news but if you're digging and following these kind of stories that become very interesting. Cano was a sophomore in high school. What he ends up doing is, uhm, gets expelled from high school for drug issues, he-- this was some of his Facebook post that he would put up, uhm, and was selling marijuana in campus. So they expelled him from the school. He sat home for 2 years planning his revenge, his desire to come back to that school and actually hurt these people. What I have for you to watch is a 60-second video clip that he, uhm, basically put together prior to the attack then he told one of his friends his desire to carry out the attack, he shared with his friends what he was planning to do and, uhm, his friend told the police and actually stop this attack from happening. But we're talking about kind of what goes on the mind of people when they get this higher stage of depersonalizing and objectifying targets. Think this gives us some insight into it. 

00:10:40
8/17/2011: Jared Cano 

00:10:40
JARED CANO For those of you retards who don't know who I am, I'm the Freedom High School shooter in Tampa, Florida. Well, I will be in a couple months. I thought I'd just run over my game plan with y'all. The cafeteria at Freedom. My plan is to set a bomb here at point A, here at point B, point C, and point D. Then I gotta get to the side entrance of the school by 7:24. The bombs blow at 7:26 and then I'm gonna advance on the courtyard. I'm gonna come in and advance on the courtyard where there'll probably be at least 60 people, come through the door, then shoot everybody at the front desk. Mr. Costanzo's office is right here, I've gotta kill him. Ms. Carmody is here, I gotta kill her. Mr. Pears is here, I gotta make sure he doesn't die, 'cause I like him. Did I choose to think like this? No. That's just how I am. If you don't like it, just find a way to find people like me and line us up and shoot us. 

00:11:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT So, within a 60-second video I could get an entire 3-hour threat assessment training on this. What, what worries you all or were you shelling(ph) to see that video? Besides everything, obviously everything, everything worries you. When we talk about the field-- this idea of fantasy rehearsal that when you fantasized about something over and over again you do develop this kind of nonchalantness to it, right. So in other word, I'm gonna make you one. Uhm, you know, just kinda role with it, and when you hear him talk, there's a collective affect, there's a, you know, if we are talking about killing people we would hopefully have, ah, an appreciation for the, depth of that but you don't get that for now. You know at the end he says, this is just the way I am and if you don't like people like me just round us up and shoot us. So one of the things we see when people moved towards these kind of attacks, the suicidality creeps in a sense of hopelessness and desperation. I would hope that if you guys didn't like how it was going with one of your assignments or if you were in trouble or something you'll be in well, if you don't like what I'm doing just shoot me with a gun. Like that would be a natural way of responding but his hopelessness, his desperation, his kind of lack of a positive future comes out in some of those terms for sure. Lot of specificity, right. Remember high school-- sorry to bring out back there, but remember high school for a minute. High school was a time where everything was time to the minute, 7:25 (inaudible ) 27, you went to first period, that's what his time sort of tied to. So this is a very specific, tactical, strategic, attack. He spent some time thinking about this. How's the video start? Listen all you retards, you know, and what does that say if we break that down for a minute right that I'm superior, I'm smarter, I'm here and you all are down here to be punished. And we see that theme just running out again and again and again. So the temptation is to see these really horrific events, these targeted shooting events, things like Virginia attack and, uhm, the Roger's case up in California and, ah Kazmierczak at NIU, uhm, homes in Colorado, we see this and we say these are evil monsters, there is nothing we can do to stop it, well I would pull out you and this is where the key of the talk here, that if we tune in early on to this depersonalization and objectification of target, if we look at this idea of separation, inability to empathize, that's really some of the early clues that we get when people are moving on this path. When he says, I don't wanna kill this one guy, right, so that gives us some specificity that he's thinking about I'm gonna kill you and not you and you. I probably could figure out who that teacher is, right. He's probably someone who care about him as a person, kind of be like, oh, you, you need to stop all those drug stuff and kind of buckle up and get to college. Like someone who saw passed the stuff he was doing wrong and really saw him as a person, yeah. The question of audience, yeah, who is, who is he thinking kind of to be hurt and, you know, for this it really as a, an example of leakage cuz it's found prior to the attack. Other times we'll get something called the legacy token so right at the moment of attack the person doing the attack will release either a media package or YouTube video. For him this was found kind of on-- as he was planning. I think the, I think his message was NBC news or CNN like I think this is the world was, I am the Freedom High School shooter and he is kind of defining himself in that way. Uhm, so I think he is trying to control some of the media message there. Cool, good start, good, ah, you guys are all on this threat assessment piece where, where we watch it, so you're in a good place. 

00:14:50
On Valetines day 2008, Steven Kazmierczak stood in front of a terrified lecture hall, horrific images of skull impaled with a knife on one arm and a depection of a jigsaw killer from the Saw torture film on the other (Keen, 2008; Sander, 2008; Vann, 2008; Van 2009) 

00:14:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, some other things to think about here when you are looking at some of these attacks, this was Kazmierczak, uhm, the NIU school shooter. I don't recognize the, the tattoo's here. Not so much the skull with the knife in its head that one I'm not quite sure with the is, what's the other one? Yeah, from the Saw movie right, it's the jigsaw killer. So again, you know, you're looking at these kind of shooters and we study their cases, at least as I study their cases cuz I'm a depressing individual. Uhm, I spend some time trying to understand what motivated them. One of the things we see if anyone ever saw the Saw movies it's all about someone in power, exhibiting that power onto other people and making them for perceived wrongs, right, so you see a tattoo like this, you see his devotion to this kind of character and it becomes kind of the tip of the iceberg, you know, one of the things I would hope is that we would see that and say, "Hey, man, what, what's that tattoo about? Why did you get it?" Or "What do this movie mean to you?" Or what-- you are not a profile people of tattoos, we don't want colleges lining up everyone with tattoos. I mean like, what your tattoo mean? And like that's not too far but having an eye for this kind of stuff and appreciate it cuz prior to the attack. 

00:15:55
2/14/2008:Kazmierczak He wore black jeans and a black T-shirt with the word "Terrorist" printed over a of an assault rifle across the chest. 

00:15:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT This was his Halloween costume, the Halloween before the attack. He really idolized this guy, and if you follow the movie you understand what the idea of punishing people. Uhm, he also idolized, loved the movie Fight Club. I love the movie Fight Club. What's Fight Club about? What's the main message of Fight Club? 

00:16:10
UNKNOWN Getting back at the man. 

00:16:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Getting back at the man. Usually someone says not to talk about Fight Club. So, I was waiting for that, so over is thinking but yeah, it's exactly that it's getting back at the man, it's kind of rising up the proletariat and pulling down the oligarchy, yeah, exactly. Uhm, I love Fight Club, I think it's a great movie but the reason he loved it, again tied into the esteem, the desire to harm others. To kinda take away what other people have that he didn't. So again this objectification, depersonalization runs through, uhm, a lot of these cases. 

00:16:40
Misogyny •There are numerous rampage shooters who focused their attacks on women. These attacks are often motivated by failed romantic advances and frustrations at the killer's in-ability t0 establish an intimate relationship(Van Brunt 2012.) •Frustrated, irrational, alone, hopeless, several male shooters ultimately took out their vengeance on the women who they perceived to have wronged them 

00:16:45
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, I wanna talk about misogyny a bit here, uhm, and here are the concept that I think is an important one that not only as it, uhm, a tendency to separate from others but also there's a tendency, uhm, to have that separation kind of drive the thinking behind this, and the concern here is that, it's, it's I think the way to see it really is a subset of objectification and depersonalization sort of that, all of it falls under this. Let's talk about how this gets specifically directed towards women because this plays out a number of cases. 

00:17:10
Anthony Powell fired a shotgun at a black female college student before using a handgun to kill himself. It was reported he had suffered from depression and had previously tried to date her but was rejected in a YouTube™ clip prior to the attack, he says "I'm really thinking about killing myself. I think I am going to do it. I'm just scared" 

00:17:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT This is a case back in, uhm, wanna say 2010 or so at, ah, a community college where Anthony Powell came in and killed a classmate named Asia McGowan. And one of the things I'm gonna show you the media did a quick video clip of him and the YouTube clips that he would put up. And what you're gonna hear from him I think is important. We're gonna hear some of this misogynistic language, it comes I think from this idea of Christian fundamentalism that women are supposed to be subservient to sort of their men in that basic idea and I think he takes that twisted. And says, I'm the king, you're the queen you're gonna serve me, why do you think you're gonna get respect and I'm not gonna give you respect. At the heart of his problem here to is a rejection by a female that he wanted to be with and she rejected him so she kills him or he kills her. And we see this again and again and again. We see this with Rodgers in California, we'll talk about that case and probably another case, you're familiar with George Sodini where women then become blamed for the failings of the individual. Watch the summary here in this case. 

00:18:15
LIVE ONLY ON Peggy Agar Dearborn 

00:18:15
PEGGY AGAR Mary(ph), there's been a lot of talk about Anthony Powell 2 days after police say he killed a student and himself here on campus. The talk comes from Anthony Powell himself. 

00:18:25
ONLY ON ACTION NEWS 

00:18:25
ANTHONY POWELL We have to stop and ask ourselves a question. If you're a black female, you talked about you want respect. What do you-- what, what, what would-- why do you deserve respect? 

00:18:35
PEGGY AGAR He has remained a mystery since the day police say he shot and killed classmate Asia McGowan at Henry Ford Community­ college and turn the gun on himself. Tonight we see what many believe Anthony Powell wanted us to see on YouTube. His many, many faces. 

00:18:50
ANTHONY POWELL ... queen to me is a real woman that's going to stick by her, her, her king, her man and is obedient to her husband, submissive to her husband... 

00:19:00
PEGGY AGAR Identified in the videos by friends and neighbors, blogger say Anthony Powell recently talked online about killing himself. 

00:19:05
ANTHONY POWELL There's absolutely (inaudible ) this life. I, I, I had no purpose. There's no, there's no point for me to live anymore. I really have to think about killing myself and I'm pretty much gonna do it. I'm so scared. The only-- I don't have 9 millimeter anymore. The only thing that I have is my shotgun and it ain't going to be pretty with that. 

00:19:25
PEGGY AGAR There is a reference to a shotgun, post about troubles with women saying the story with the sexy girl continues but that situation with short girl is over with. The man known as Tony 48219 online often rented against atheism and evolution. 

00:19:45
ANTHONY POWELL The fairytales of evolution are-- is, is, is entertaining in its satire(ph) and this comedy is the funniest comedy ever. I'm laughing! 

00:19:55
PEGGY AGAR And the face many saw was anger. 

00:20:00
ANTHONY POWELL I'd smashed you with ease. Man, it's nothing hard. 

00:20:05
BRIAN VAN BRUNT So what stands out for you on this one? Well, I can-- obviously everything. But what else concerned you on this? What's, what's speaks to you? Just kind of this lay folks or be if psychology background. What was the motivation here? What are the things that resonate with you? Just for the camera, the idea of a break that maybe he was experiencing and maybe, you know, posting it online, giving us an opportunity to maybe to intervene with him. If folks are watching this, and some of the work that I do across the country is training colleges and universities to develop what are called behavioral intervention teams. And these teams are groups of people that meet each week, uhm, usually for about an hour and talking about at-risk student behavior and trying to find a way that have some interventions, try to work with those students, trying to get out ahead of this kind of stuff. So this is exactly the kind of thing that we're looking for. If you are familiar with YouTube sometimes with YouTube people put this kind of videos up and they kinda mug a bit for the camera, you know, they kinda act, they put on, uhm, you know, airs, so it'll be hard to know. One of the questions I wish I could have figured out is was he like this all the time? Or it just a special way he was behaving for the camera, uhm, cuz when people, you know, having this YouTube videos back and forth you tend to get a little bit more excited, a little bit more engaged, and things you get upset. So was this his normal way of talking or is this something new? Be curious to know. What else stood out for you in the video? We hear suicidality again, yeah, uhm, the idea of, I'm not, I'm not gonna be round anymore, he is arguing with himself, kind of what the guns he has so we, he just wanna do this with a shotgun but he is gonna do this with the 9 millimeter. He actually ends up shooting her with the shotgun and shooting himself with a handgun, uhm, so, you know, the idea of suicidality is one of the risk factors that we look for around this kind of, uhm, cases as we're trying to get out ahead of them, for sure. Did you hear some of the misogyny there? Did you hear some of the language? Right, and you can tell where it sort of came from, this again I think more of a fundamentalist Christian kind of look at the world that women are supposed to be subservient to men and I think he really takes that twisted and just kind of double downs on, double down on that idea of saying this is how it's gonna be, he gets angry at women who are rejecting him, uhm, he also gets on to the atheist thing too, right. So it's a hardened point of view. This becomes another risk factor that we're concerned with, that for every person who has moved forward with rampage violence has ca-- carried out one of the attacks you've seen on the news, or you've studied, or you've talking about. Every single one of those people had a hardened and inflexible way of seeing the world. So when we are working with our college students working in our classrooms, one of the things that I encourage people to look for are these hardened perspectives, uhm, that these hardened perspectives, this is the way it is, this is what I deserve and I'm frustrated that I didn't get this. Now everyone had has a perspective like thank God it does not move up to, you know, ah, ever see Thanksgiving dinner at Brian's house, it wouldn't go well, right, that's-- we get into arguments, we have firmly-held beliefs, right? Some of you watched John Stewart, some of you watched, uhm, the Fox News, right. Some of you have very strong feelings about abortion, some of you have strong feelings about politics, about religion, we all have strong feelings. The hardened point of view where it gets concerning is you really can't see anyone else's point of view, you can't listen to another's perspective, and then you climb this ladder, the scale of aggression, you then get involved in harmful debate. You start just arguing of people for the sake of arguing. It goes out from there to, uhm, being able not to argue anymore, you get so pressured, you can't even talk. Then you look to build coalitions, you find other people who share your beliefs. You start to take limited destructive blows are your target. All of this, you know, is kind of a-- identify in some of this the video. 

00:23:25
•Elliot Rodgers, 22, Isla Vista, 5/23/2014 -Rodgers stabbed to death three men in his apartment and then drove to a sorority house killing four more. He then struck four more with his car. - He left a video and a manifesto describing the motive for his attacks as a desire to punish women for rejecting him and also a desire to punish sexually active men for living a better life than him. 

00:23:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Talking about a more recent attack, this was, ah, last year. Maybe it's something you've seen on the news before as well. Uhm, this really for me, uhm there's two cases. This one of the two that were cover that really highlights the idea of this anti-women misogynistic, uhm, I didn't get what I wanted from the woman so I'm gonna come back and hurt a group of people. And this attack for Rodgers if you've read his manifesto or seen his video, or watch a little of the video, uhm, here today. This attack was driven by his frustration about not having sex at 22. Uhm, he felt rejected, he felt like because he wasn't able to have sex with a woman at 22 that his life was over, uhm, he didn't understand by other guys, he called them assholes who go out there and be able to have sex and do everything they wanted. At college you're supposed to be able to do that, he really brought in to that idea. And he kinda get stuck with the, where's mine? You know, I'm doing everything right I'm not getting what I deserve. So what he does is he escalates, I mean he see as people, you know, out walking holding hands, he throw a soda at them. Whereas we're noticing this behavior that he starts to do. He starts to challenge people in public, or having fun. And he targets, he fig-- fixated some focuses on a target, that target happens to be a sorority house. Cuz for him that is the epitome of the women that are rejecting him. That sort of blond sorority kind of image that he had in his head. These are the girls above all others that should have love me but didn't. So I'm gonna make them pay. What you're following along is a sort of a ridiculous concept that because of your shortcomings you're gonna attack these other people, uhm, who didn't have any idea who he was. There wasn't a personal rejection to it. This was just the place he focused on. So I wanna show you a little bit of his video and it's particularly creepy. He has very, again, this detached kind of way of talking but listen for the themes that were talking about. The objectification, uhm, depersonalization, seeing others as different than he is, and then finally this misogynistic attitude towards women uhm, really being the source of his motivation.

ELLIOT RODGER Hi, Elliot Rodger here. Well, this is my last video, it all has to come to this. Tomorrow is the day of retribution. The day in which I will have my revenge against humanity, against all of you. For the last 8 years of my life ever since I've hit puberty I've been forced to endure an existence of loneliness, rejection and un-fulfilled desires, all because girls have never been attracted to me. Girls gave their affection and sex and love to other men but never to me. I'm 22 years old and I'm still a virgin, I've never even kissed a girl. I been through college for 2 and a half years, more than that actually. And I'm still a virgin and it has been very torturous. College is the time when everyone experiences those things such as sex and fun and, and pleasure. Within those years I've had to rot and loneliness. It's not fair. You girls have never been attracted to me, I don't know why you girls aren't attracted to me. But I will punish you all for it. It's an injustice, a crime because I don't know what you don't at me. I'm the perfect guy and yet you furry yourselves in all these obnoxious men instead of me, the supreme gentlemen. I will punish all of you for it. On the day of retribution, I am going to enter the hottest sorority house of UCSB and I will slaughter every single spoiled stock up blonde slut I see inside there. All those girls that I have desired so much, they have all rejected me and looked down upon me as an inferior man. If I ever made a sexual advance towards them while they throw themselves at this obnoxious brute. I'll take great pleasure in slaughtering all of you. You will finally see that I am in truth the superior one, the true alpha male. Yes, after I've annihilated every single girl in the sorority house, I'll take to the street of Isla Vista and sleigh every single person I see there. All those popular kids, who live such lives of hedonistic pleasure while I have to rot in loneliness for all these years, they've all look down upon me every time I try to go out and join them. They've all treated me like a mouse. But now I will be a god compared to you. You will all be animals, you are animals and I will slaughter you like animals. I'll be a god exacting my retribution and all those who deserve it and you do deserve it. Just for the crime of living a better life in me, all you popular kids, you've never accepted me and now you all pay for it. And girls, all I've ever wanted was to love you and to be loved by you. I've wanted a girlfriend. I've wanted sex. I wanted love, affection, adoration. And you think I'm unworthy of it. That's a crime that can never be forgiven. If I can't have you, girls, I will destroy you. 

00:30:20
[sil.] 

00:30:25
ELLIOT RODGER You denied me a happy life and in turn I will deny all of your life. It's only fair. I hate all of you. Humanity is a disgusting, wretched, depraved species. If I had it in my power I would stop at nothing to reduce every single one of you to mountains of skulls and rivers of blood. And rightfully so you deserved to be annihilated and I will give that to you. You never showed me any mercy, and so I will show you none. 

00:31:25
[sil.] 

00:31:30
ELLIOT RODGER You forced me to suffer all my life and that will make you all suffer. I've waited a long time for this. I'll give you exactly what you deserve. All of you. All you girls who rejected me and looked down upon and, you know, treated me like scum while you gave yourself to other man. And all of you man for living a better life and the all of you sexually active men I hate you. I hate all of you. I can't wait to give you exactly what you deserve, utter annihilation. 

00:32:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT It's about all I have, take I watch him too often and messes me up. uhm, what, what did you hear there that concerned you? If you guys haven't watch that for the whole videos in YouTube too if you're interested, yeah. 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:32:30
BRIAN VAN BRUNT It is, he comes from, ah, Hollywood, he comes from, you know, Hollywood family, uhm, and I do think there's certainly an acting part to this that he set up the shot very carefully the sun kind of coming across and I think he was very aware. This is the creation of a legacy token which we see very often in this kind of attacks, the ability to create a media package that's going to describe after, doing the aftermath of the attack. Why he did it, and he was very aware that people are gonna be watching this afterwards, uhm, so-- but we also heard the fantasy rehearsal, right. Remember with Cano that same kind of thing like he is comfortable with this. In the same way after today when you're tired and going home you want have a glass of wine, you might read of book, you might go for a run, whatever you do to unwind, whatever-- however you deal with stress, the way he deals with stress when he is overwhelmed is he goes back to his plan. And he fantasizes about what this is gonna be like to pay back the women who've hurt him. For us, it's much hopefully, much more adopted, right. We have a glass of wine, we read a book, we go for a run, watch our favorite TV show, something that we did to take care of our self. For him he retreat into this fantasy. So the idea again is almost like a narcissism like everything is happening to me and he had autism spectrum disorder, it was one of the diagnostic patterns which is also part of that disorder, Asperger as well. This, this idea of not really being able to tune in a lot to other folks. Uhm, also irrational thoughts are-- you hear him, you know, using expanded words like rot or, you know, this slut like, he, he it's almost not enough just to say that he wants to say, he needs to make it bigger in some way. But certainly no taking of personal responsibility. You know he feels like he's perfect but I, I almost have the image of an apple that's sort of rotten on the inside. Like I think he knows that the outside looks nice but maybe inside he is lacking. Some of the comments on this YouTube video if you are to go and look at it or, uhm, disturbing and horrific because a lot of women will look and post and say I do him. Uhm, and that was a theme of a lot of the comments on this. Like I don't know what he is talking, I'd have sex with him. So, uhm, on some level, you know, you have this point where if we tried hard enough he probably could have found what he was looking for, he tried once or twice but he gets drank, he goes to a party acts like fool, people reject him. Uhm, so I think he wanted this, uhm, he just didn't have a great, what I'm gonna call frustration tolerance to deal with all the kind of ins and outs of this because he did have everything that he needed, I will argue, to move forward and have a relationship with someone. What he lacks though was the frustration tolerance. When things didn't go well, when people didn't give him what he deserved, right, and his attitude was I walk into the room and why didn't all the women laying down ready to have sex with me, that's the way college is, that's the way it should happen. I put on this shirt, this are my glasses this is my car it's a BMW, let's go. Like that's really how he saw the world which I think he sensed on some level was, you know, again this apple with a rotten core part. So this idea of kind of being almost like a religious experience for him, that kind of seeing things above and beyond, name-- naming things in extreme ways, day of retribution, when the day of retribution is upon you I will come in here and destroy this sorority, uhm, I'm the consummate gentleman so why would people reject me. Definitely highbrow and high flowing language for sure. The troubling, uhm, arch really and I think what it comes back to which I think relates the conference team is in how we look at objectification, how we look at misogyny, how we look at, uhm, depersonalization. We stop seeing people as people, what we see them as objects, you know, that, that's played out here very clearly with the sorority house and these aren't really people. They are these barbie dolls that are rejecting me and I think that's how he saw them. I think he knew any of them, he didn't know anything about them. Uhm, so that is one of the problems and, you know, in terms of solution which we kinda get to at the end I think part of it is education, part of it is all the great stuff we're doing right now with the violence against women act, part of it is addressing by stander, getting people in the community stand up and try to help with this as well. And really try to change the culture, in the same way what we did to a cigarettes, right. That's not okay anymore with the going price for a pack of cigarettes now in New York City. You know, 11-- $12 I guess, it's not cheap. Like we pushed away some other social problems that we've had and we've done a nice job with that. I think this idea of, uhm, misogynistic, rape culture, depersonalization, I think this is the next thing that were working on. Seeing people as people, rather as objects and that we actually confront that when we see people doing that, uhm, some are serious work, he's (inaudible ) cop, brilliant guy who's love his training stuff, uhm, you know, the micro-aggressions stuff, so brilliant, you know, the idea of connecting and trying to see beyond just are outside attributes to the things that we define ourselves as and getting to know people as people. You know finding those opportunities to connect. Brilliant stuff. 

00:36:55
On August 4th, 2009, forty eight- year-old George Sodini entered an LA fitness gym in Pennsylvania and shot seven women in aerobics class, killing three before committing suicide. He had previously taken online workshops on how to date younger women to try to deal with his inability to successfully date women in their young twenties. 

00:36:55
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Sodini, uhm, and just, you know, here's this case, I reviewed this case for years then Rodgers came along and I was like, oh, well here we have it again. Let me remind you that this is, this is been stuff going on for a long time, this is back in 2009. It's a 48-year-old guy, he is goal in life was to date 20-year-old women. Listen, I'd been a therapist for about 18 years, that's my profession, I worked as a director at counseling at colleges so I wanna to support people in their goals. But if your goal, you know where this is going, right? If your goal is to date 20-year-old women and you're a 48-year-old guy, you better have a high frustration tolerance for rejection, cuz it's a hard path to choose, right? If I wanted to be a horse jockey I don't wanna take that take dream away from but I have some more (inaudible ) cut off a leg or something like, I'd have so, I'd have a hard road in front of me. And here is another guy very much like Rodger who did not have that frustration tolerance, and just felt as if, uhm, the world owed him. This really I think a good way to see this. 

00:37:50
8/4/2009: George Sodini R.Don Steele Author Sodini attended a workshop by Ron Steele designed to teach older men how to meet and date young women. The curriculum is taught through videos, role-plays at hotel seminars, and through Steele's video blog. Not surprisingly Sodini ran into trouble achieving his goal of dating women thirty years his junior. 

00:37:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, Sodini fell in with this group called Ron Steele, if you're familiar with it don't raise your hand cuz it's embarrassing to be connected cuz he is a jerk. Uhm, he preys on men on-- through the internet and teaches men how to date young women. He run seminars, who went out to ramada and men will come to this seminar who hired coeds to sit at the table at front and talk about how the men in the group can talk to younger women and be more successful. They use all the good things of psychology like role playing and empathy for a horrible, horrible purpose. And Sodini fell in with these guys, you can see him in some of the seminars talking about this. He bought in to the idea of, if I just do this right I'm gonna be able to get all the young women I want. And surprisingly he fails at that and, uhm, then plans this attack. He spends about 9 months thinking about the attack, he writes on a blog in a lot of detail about his plans for the attack and how he was gonna carry out his, uhm, his end attack. Uhm, the blog is interesting, some of the things he write's I think it might be on the next slide. 

00:38:50
8/4/2009:George Sodini this frustration and hopelessness contributed to his targeted attack on women's aerobics class. He wrote in his blog prior to the attack, "No girlfriend since 1984, last Christmas with Pam was in 1983. Who knows why. I am not ugly or too weird. No sex since July 1990 either (I was 29)." The day before the shooting he writes, "I took off today, Monday, and tomorrow to practice my routine and make sure it is well polished. I need to work out every detail, there is only one shot." It is Sodini's irrational thinking here that drives his anger and frustration towards women. As a 48-year-old man, he seeks to date women in their early twenties. When he becomes frustrated by his la ck of success, he turns into rage projected onto the woman, he most desires. He slays seven women during an aerobics class. They ar e the embodiment of untouchable youth and beauty; objectified and distanced from him-they are forever outside his grasp. 

00:38:50
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Writes that, uhm, he-- there is 30 million women, available women in the US and all of them have rejected him. So this is like don't want to mar-- like he hasn't dated or asked out 30 million women, what did he, he do, he went to the census data and calculated the women he is willing to date between like 20 and 25 and pull back US census data and said, these are the women that are available to me, all of them rejected me. So I mean, that kind of catastrophizing troubled irrational thought but all based on this idea of wanting to achieve something. If we go back to the beginning with him, like if we sit him on a couch and place him psychotherapy with him, why is this his desire? You know, what is he trying to get this at? So I have a person that he's trying to get but there's very specific type, we're back to the objectification again, we're back to the misogyny, we're back to the depersonalization. It's not a partner he is even looking for, it's a thing. So we wanna stop this kind of violence and I'm looking at these large cases, maybe I have at you probably-- guys are pretty much more comfortable looking at, just the everyday interactions but if we stop and look at some of these large cases where people go on these shootings sprees this is where it starts. This is where the iteration start early on. The feeling like they've deserved something and if they've separated from their humanity the other person they're dealing with. It's a brief video summarizing the attack here.

SUZANNE MALVEAUX He was lonely, frustrated and hated women because he felt rejected by them so he decided to unleash hell, that's the picture that has being painted by police even by the gunman's own admissions posted on the internet. Right now CNN is going inside the mind of a gunman to see why he walked into Pittsburgh area gym with four guns and open fire. And there is a twist, CNN is learning the gunman was playing games to reveal what he was going to do. Wait until you hear that from our internet reporter Abbi Tatton but let's first begin with CNN's Jeanne Meserve she is at the crime scene outside Pittsburgh. Jeanne what do we know so far?

JEANNE MESERVE Suzanne, as you know, three dead, nine win-- wounded and after a tragic event like this there is always a question why.

00:41:25
Women just don't like me. There are 30 million desirable women in the US(my estimate) and I cannot find one. Not one of them finds me attractive "TOTALLY ALONE...ISOLATED" "Thanks for nada, [EXPLETIVE]! Bye."" 

00:41:25
JEANNE MESERVE The same rage and frustration runs throughout a blog Sodini kept cataloging his thoughts and actions. Women just don't like me. There were 30 million desirable women in the US, my estimate, and I cannot find one. Not one of them finds me attractive. He calls himself totally alone, isolated and he writes, thanks for nada bitches, bye.

00:42:25
SUZANNE MALVEAUX Thank you Jeanne, in a moment take us, ah, to Abbi Tatton and Abby understand he have an incredible development even following this, ah, online, ah, what, what did he put online? What do we know? 

00:42:35
ABBI TATTON Suzanne, it looks like Sodini was teasing us to find this information that he posted. I wanna show you his website, the front page of it looks innocuous enough. It's got holiday pictures here there's a listing for a used car that he was trying to sell, but I wanna show you this part here where it says, life or death. If you click on that it takes you to a whole another page, it asks you to guess the date of Sodini's death. He knew that would be August 4th, he knew that would be yesterday. If you input that date it leads you to this page that Jeanne was just telling us about. This rambling page of information about exactly what he was planning to do last night. Suzanne. 

00:43:15
SUZANNE MALVEAUX Abbi how long was this up there? 

00:43:15
ABBI TATTON That's pretty hard to tell but what we have been able to find out is that Sodini appeared to be working on this in that hour before that he went to the gym. There are timestamps on this document and other places in the website, 6:07pm, 6:10pm, police say that in the 7:00pm hour that when he went to the gym. Suzanne. 

00:43:35
SUZANNE MALVEAUX Incredible. Thank you, Abbi Tatton. 

00:43:40
BRIAN VAN BRUNT I get to do these talks a lot. Usually they're more focused on violence and threat assessment and how to prevent shootings but let me tell you my, quick as we're coming to an end thought on this, uhm, after these shootings what we hear from a lot of people is that these things are neither predictable nor preventable and what I'd like to do is pushed back on half of that. Uhm, I do think they are not predictable, that it is very difficult and anyone who tells you they can do it well I would have some questions for them, uhm, that we can predict these kind of things. Talk to one person, uhm, try to make a prediction, this one kid is gonna be one coming back with a hand gun to the school, it is very hard to predict that. In the same way it's hard to predict suicide because you have a person maybe who's been hurt, traumatized, they wanna, you know, they are frustrated to other on how they been treated, you take that one kid who's gone through high school at that right and you can almost paint a picture of what it will be like to be a killer. But you can paint that same picture and say then he becomes a therapist or becomes a teacher, or beco-- so the idea of like what motivates someone to make that path more negative that path with a violence versus a pathway to put social behavior. It's really hard to predict that. But what we're really good at, is prevention, and part of the training that I do is talking about how we identify the risk factors. I were to ask you the risk factors for suicide, uhm, what would you guys say? What are some of the risk factors you know if someone is suicidal? 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN Isolated. 

00:45:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah, they're isolated. Thank you, uhm. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN Impulsive. 

00:45:00
BRIAN VAN BRUNT They are impulsive, they're isolated, maybe they don't have access, ah, maybe they have access to, ah, lethal means, they have a gun. 

00:45:05
UNKNOWN Past attempts. 

00:45:10
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Yeah, past attempts, if you are male between 18 to 22, that's a risk factor, one of the highest risk factors. 

00:45:15
UNKNOWN Hopelessness. 

00:45:15
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Hopelessness, desperation, uhm, pre-existing mental health conditions. All these things and right off the top of our head, we're really good an saying these are the risk factors. How about heart attacks? Same thing, right? uhm, healthy eating, you know, what and how someone's eating, exercise, pre-existing hereditary conditions, weight I mean all of these things we have an understanding, you know, sedentary lifestyle, all these things lead to a higher risk for a heart attack. So we can prevent these things by understanding the risk factors by putting things in place. But I were to ask you what are the risk factors for rampage violence and shooting, I don't know, I don't know that we have that same kind of language here. It certainly doesn't come as quickly, unlike a fascination with listening to like the cure's lullaby and like wearing black trench coats or something. I don't know. It was that my cure joke not landing with the all of him. Getting, I'm getting older I need to, to drop some cashier (inaudible ) something on you like.

BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, so I'll come back to this but this is what I developed out of that book that's going around if it's still out there, the ending campus violence. These are for me the 35 risk factors that I think are most prevalent when I've look at the research related to mass casualty events. Uhm, many of these have overtones that we were just talking about, uhm, the, ah, depersonalization, objectification, uhm, so these are all based in, ah, a system I developed called the SIVRA and if you extend more information about that I can make that available to you. That black book you can write down your email, happy to send that to you. uhm, and this is what I do training on, really across the country, uhm, to teach colleges and universities how to use this SIVRA when they are talking with students to get a better understanding, do they have a like with have moving forward with this kind of violence. Uhm, this article is one that I wrote with, uhm, my colleague Scott Lewis in the journal of a gender and violence and it's on costuming, ah, misogyny objectification as risk factors in targeted violence. I'll be happy to send you a copy that same thing just drop me an email, if you don't wanna give me your email, my cards are up here so you can grab a card afterwards. So, hey that article, can you send me a copy, psh, send it right up to you.

00:47:20
BRIAN VAN BRUNT Uhm, this is that more on the SIVRA piece. So I have a couple minutes for, uhm, questions uhm, so conference we have coming up on NaBITA if you're interested in threat assessment work, it's one of the things that we do out this way to but tell me, uhm, questions, thoughts, things that I can talk about, yeah. Yeah, we have, uhm, scoring system and if you're interested in the SIVRA, uhm, we do a full-day training on it and it's a whole process but if you just want the article for it, and you wanna see how it scored how this, ah, the 35 risk factors are scored, uhm, I can, I can send that to you. Yeah, essentially when it comes down there are these three levels, low moderate and high. Once we question to moderate we become concerned each of the 35 SIVRA items is rated zero, one or two, once you get to 20 that's really at the cutoff point that we're concerned with. The first 12 are, uhm, weighted more heavily so be at four more the first 12, we move up into a higher category as well. So that's just-- it's, ah, a fairly simple scoring method but, uhm, yeah. It's a bunch, once you get a bunch then we're concerned and it starts to move up a good, a good bunch, yeah, or, or, or just a few but other important few that's why it moves up. The common representing immature had a major identity problems, I mean a lot of it really is this lack of connection with other people, uhm, but it's challenging. Right, we look at the Sandy Hook case for example. We have Adam Lanza, people there, oh, he has Asperger's so people Asperger's now go on campus shooting sprees. Well, not really, you know, not more, most people with Asperger's or autism spectrum disorder are not going on campus shooting sprees. Most people with PTSD after the Fort Hood shooting that was a couple of years back oh, PTSD killed everyone cuz he have PTSD. Well, no. There's tens of millions of people with PTSD who don't go killing people. But it's the pieces and this is what the SIVRA I think does well. So, it's not major depression 29633 in the DSM-IV. Now, that coded disorder that we're concerned with, right. It is the hopelessness and the desperation and lack of options. It's not as Asperger's, it's the inability to form intimate relationships and being isolated. Lanza's problem he was isolated, no one could see any of the leakage cuz he was locked in his basement only talking to his mom. So no one saw that escalated, if he had friends and he was out on the community and talking to people he would have freaked a lot of people out in some and would have said something. But he was isolated. So this is the challenge, right cuz the media says, Asperger's go get them. It's like no, it's not Asperger's but part of Asperger's pulls people life in social connection and when they're isolated like that, that becomes the risk factor. The idea of sort of terroristic kind of violence and this kind of violence, I would argue all predatory and targeted violence is also terroristic violence. So, there is an exact connection between all of these things. When people pair up with a radical ideology, that's a hardened point of view. Think about Westboro Baptist Church for a minute with the signs with the God hates fags and the protesting military funerals. These are people who are locked into seeing this. They challenge other people for like this is what I believe and I put it in another people's face and get into arguments, they get frustrated, they stop talking, they walk away, they build coalitions with other people who share similar thoughts and then those coalitions come together and do targeted limited strikes sometimes through medias and they build up to the attack. And that's-- if you look at terrorist thinking, it follows that exact same process. So the idea of overlap between sexual violence and someone early on ask me after going to the SIVRA training he said, Brian, this is all sexual violence too and I'm like, ah, I didn't design it that way but when I look at the items, yeah, right it is. And to me it goes back to that central concept. When people ask me like an airplane or in the elevator like what do you do, and then he find they are like shock to go, okay. Stopping killings and that, what how there, what do you think? They're evil as nothing, there's nothing we can do and I'm like, no. What we can do is the same thing we can do to stop sexualize violence that we start to see people as people, we connect to each other as people, we got passed seeing other folks as objects and we learn to respect each other and that's why (inaudible ) work really was motivational for just that the micro-aggressions stuff locks into this so well, cuz it's not always the intent of the person as being offensive, right. It's how do we have that conversation to bring people back. So what I love to do is what I capitalize the violence against women act, stuff that's going on right now, looking at fraternity hazing, looking at alcohol, looking in all these other things that actually putting women at higher risk for sexual assault, stocking and IPV, so how do we use that to also address this larger issue of falling at a contact to each other. Uhm, that we stop seeing each other's people, we see each other as targets. Cuz when people come in to my office, when I-- you start at Western. It wasn't Brian father of four guy who likes to (inaudible ) and likes watching Adventure Time with his kid that they were yelling at, it was the director of counseling. It was a cog in the bureaucratic will of Western that they were frustrated at. So as soon we get passed that title in this sense, we can actually get towards that change. So enough there's a round of about answering your question, but if I, if I can just underline the idea that yes, a lot of things we're dealing within our society, where in rape culture and misogyny and depersonalization and all the things that lead to increasing risk factors for violence against women, a lot of this overlaps, big time. Bullying as well, you know, if you like a bullying that kind of behavior same theory. When I do trainings for large groups of people in NaBITA the group that I'm with here, you know, we do tra-- the most trainings on this topic, we train thousands of schools, we do a 3-day trainings on these topics. Part of that I fought for was actually using (inaudible ) micro-aggression work in the middle of 2-hour talk in the middle of that training. About exactly what you are saying. Cultural issues, how those overlap, uhm, the intent versus impact. Uhm, how to actually get in there and think about why people do the things they do, where that's coming from and how not to move to assumptions. So this part of what we look at. Uhm, in terms of the assessment piece it's a more complicated issue but when we do the team training it's a pretty lengthy training, and we talk about the role of counseling, the difference between sort of a counseling assessment where's the threat assessment which are vastly different. Well one of the biggest problems we have in college, in higher ed right now, is when we have a student that were concerned with, we send them to the hospital to be screened and we're trying to decide if they're danger to themselves or others and they to go into the hospital. That has nothing to do with threat assessment, right, cuz what we really wondering is when the roommates is like, I'm gonna, psst, murder my roommates, he keeps hitting the snooze alarm. Some of them are mental health issue, it's a work place violence issue, so we need to lean back on some of that research, some of the work I do.
