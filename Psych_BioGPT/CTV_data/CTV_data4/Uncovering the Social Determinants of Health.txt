MICHAEL LOVE (ph) My name is Michael Love(ph). I am a faculty member in the counseling psych program here at TC. It's my pleasure today to get to, ah, introduce Dr. Lydia Buki. Ah... Dr. Buki is an Associate Professor in the Department of Kinesiology and Community Health at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Having earned her counseling psychology degree from the Arizona state University in 1995. Her area of interest is psycho-oncology with particular emphasis on the psychosocial, cultural, individual and institutional factors that contribute to health disparities in medically underserved Latino/Latina populations. She recently completed a health literacy study with funding from the National Cancer Institute and has publish in journals such as Cancer, Culture Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology and the Counseling Psychologist. In addition to being a fellow of the American Psychological Association, she has also been a recipient of five professional scientific awards including the Distinguished Professional Early Career Award from the National Latino/Latina Psychological Association in 2004. The Emerging Leader Award from the American Psychological Associations Committee on Women in psychology in 2005, and the Campus Award for Excellence in Public Engagement from the University of Illinois in 2006. Welcome Dr. Buki. 

00:01:55
LYDIA P. BUKI Alright, great. Well thank you for um, for coming to this presentation. I know the program is full of ah, very interesting competing ah, things going on.

AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN Uncovering Social Determinants of Health Lydia P. Buki, Ph.D. Dept. of Kinesiology and Community Health University of Illinois 

00:02:05
LYDIA P. BUKI Ah... What I am going to start off with in the process of telling you of my journey of uncovering ah social determinants of health. I want to start by telling you about some stories that have bearing(ph) on ah, ah, psychosocial determinants of health, ah, and ah, social determinants of health.

The New York Times Immigrants Facing Deportation by U.S. Hospitals Jury Rules for Hospital That Deported Patient Deported in a Coma, Saved Back in U.S. 

00:02:30
LYDIA P. BUKI First ah, on the left there is a picture of a man who is from Guatemala and last ah, it wasn't last year, it was the year before, it was in ah, August of 2008, the New York Times had a write up about him. He was a man who was in a car accident. Ah... He ah... was hit by a drunk driver and ah, didn't have any insurance and is undocumented. So, after several years of going through treatment ah, in ah, let's see he was in Florida. After years of going through treatment in Florida, they ah, the hospital decided that it was too costly, they couldn't handle the bills anymore and they actually charted a plane and they flew him back to Guatemala where he now lives at the top of a mountain in a hut and his mother is looking on in that picture. Ah... He has convulsions regularly. He has a number of health issues that I'm not going to ah, get into, but essentially the only treatment he is receiving right now is Alka-Seltzer, for what he needs. And on the right there is another ah, person who was deported by hospital. This was some one who was here legally in the US, but also did not have health insurance and ah, when his bills got to be too much and they felt that he was probably not going to survive, ah, that, that hospital brought him into Mexico, ah, where his parents actually followed, took him out of the hospital where he was at, when they got to that hospital they found him on a gurney in the hallway lying by himself without any type of help. Ah... They took him back to the US through California. And as you can see he is now, he's got a limp, but he is ah, pretty healthy and functioning, just fine. So, these are just some dramatic ah, examples of health disparities. And so what are health disparities? 

00:04:35
What are Health Disparities? Differences between one population and another in terms of the overall rate of disease incidence, prevalence, morbidity, mortality or survival rates (NIH, 2000) 

00:04:35
LYDIA P. BUKI Health disparities are differences between one population and another and these can be differences regarding incidence of ah, a condition, mortality, five-year survivorship rate. Any kind of difference that you find in terms of health outcomes between different populations. And there can be many reasons for the health disparities. 

00:04:55
Contributing Factors • Psychosocial • Cultural • Institutional • Biological 

00:04:55
LYDIA P. BUKI And, of course I just told you one that had some institutional components to it, but there are certainly other components that could be psychosocial, cultural and biological. I am not going to go through all of them, but, ah, cultural factors that impact the work that I do with Latino populations include cultural values such as familismo, personalismo, respeto and confianza. 

00:05:15
Cultural Factors • Values Familismo Personalismo Respeto Confianza • Health Beliefs 

00:05:20
LYDIA P. BUKI Ah... Familismo refers to the interdependence of family networks in Latino populations. Ah... So that for example if you're treating a patient, you can't separate the patient from the family. The family might actually wanna be present and help make decisions about treatment for the patient. Ah... In terms of personalismo, that means that you actually take a special interest in someone else and in Latino culture, ah, in South America for example, when you go to the doctor, you tend to have a doctor who will spend quite a bit of time with you, who will take an interest in you as a person, certainly here the manage care system does not quite, ah allow for that when people are being seen for six or seven minutes at a time. Respeto is another cultural value that's critically important and, and it's related to trust, the development of trust, ah, and for example developing trust between the patient and ah, the physician, ah, there is certain things that can go on there, that I am gonna talk about a little bit. And ah, ah, in terms of... Did I just talk... I just talked about respeto alright? So that's respect actually and confianza refers to trust and respect, ah, has more to do with ah, dealing with the hierarchy between the doctor and the patient. Ah... So that for example, in terms of health disparities, there might be a person who has a, ah, ah, medical condition, but they don't wanna seek a second opinion, because they feel that that would be disrespectful to the doctor that they have. And I have encountered several women that I work with who feel that way. They don't want to go to another doctor, because they feel that that somehow would be undermining the authority of the current doctor, not realizing that in the US this is actually quite common. And then there also health beliefs that need to be taken into consideration. Ah... Many of the women that I work with talk about, fatalismo or the sense that cancer is fatal. Certainly if you feel that something is fatal, you're not gonna have a lot of motivation to find out if you have this condition, because it means you're gonna find out you're gonna die. And... Ah... Certainly I wouldn't see any point in going to the doctor to tell me that I have a condition that I am gonna die from it if there is nothing I can do about it. So, ah, part of the cultural factors that we need to take into account is what are some of the health beliefs that we need to addresses on working with ah, ethnic minority populations. 

00:07:45
Examples of Health Disparities • Infant mortality in African Americans • Diabetes in Native Americans • Cervical Cancer in Latinas • Tuberculosis in Asian Americans • Substance abuse in LGBT 

00:07:45
LYDIA P. BUKI Now I wanted to broaden the discussion a little bit and tell you some examples of health disparities, ah, that are not just ah, related to institutional issues such as ah, hospital deportations or to psychosocial issues. Ah... Infant mortality in African-Americans is, ah, is a huge issue here in this country. African American infant mortality is about twice the infant mortality for white women. Diabetes is a huge issue with native American populations, particularly near the Gila Reservation in Arizona, where they have one of the highest rates of diabetes in the world. And ah, the reasons for the, for the diabetes have to go back to historical treaties that were done years ago ah, and food supplies and so on. I could talk more about that during the question and answer period if you're interested ah, but essentially a lot of this is preventable and that is ah, a point I wanna make, that it's psychosocially determined, ah, in large part, not in, not in it's entirety, but in large part. Latina women have rates of cervical cancer that are sometimes three times as high as that of nonwhite ah, non-Latina white women. Ah... There is a lot of variability within the Latino culture, but certain ah, women of certain ancestries tend to have higher rates of cervical cancer ah, than others and in particular for example women from Mexico and from Puerto Rico have rates that are a lot higher ah, than non-Latino white women here and rates that are higher than Cuban-American women for example. Tuberculosis in Asian-Americans. Ah... When I saw this statistics, I was just stunned. Ah... Actually, Asian-Americans in the US have a rate that's 24 times higher of TB than non-Latino whites ah, in this country. Ah... Certainly we need to do something about that. And then there is issues with substance abuse in ah, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transend... transgender populations. Ah... Again a lot of that is driven by the way society is set-up by stigma ah, and other psychosocial issues. Oops! 

00:09:55
Priority Area • National Institutes of Health • Healthy People 2010 and 2020 • NCI: Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities • Institute of Medicine Reports 

00:10:00
LYDIA P. BUKI Now the good news is that health disparities are a priority right now at various levels ah, especially at the government level. So the National Institutes of Health has health disparities as one of their top priorities ah, and they are putting quite a bit of funds into grants that are seeking to address health disparities and understand the mechanisms by which health disparities are emerging. Healthy People 2010 and 2020, these are documents that set goals for ah, for the health of the nation. And in 2010, there were some pretty lofty goals for health disparities. I don't think that many of them got met. But, the good news is, is that those goals have continued through healthy people 2020, which is right now coming out and ah, again health disparities is gonna be ah, looked at closely and we're gonna try to overcome as much of it as we can. In the work that I do, the National Cancer Institute actually has a whole center for cancer health disparities. And something I wanna mention about the NIH in general ah, is that every single institute at the NIH right now has to have a plan for how they're going to address health disparities within their institute, which I think is just ah, tremendous ah, asset that we have to have those kinds of resources put into it. In addition, there are several institute of medicine reports ah, that discuss health disparities ah, and those reports tend to be very comprehensive, they’re very interesting, they cover all the whole gamut of health disparities and what some other psychosocial issues can be. So, I highly recommend looking at those as well. 

00:11:40
Why do Psychologists Need to Become Involved? Why Psychology as a Discipline? • Psychology's aspiration to become a health profession • Mental health parity law • Interdisciplinary issue Source: Anderson, 2003; DHHS, 2008; Gambescia et al., 2006 

00:11:45
LYDIA P. BUKI And so now, given the scenario why should psychologist become involved? And one of the aspirations of psychology is to become a health profession and this is something that the CEO of the American Psychological Association Norman Anderson has discussed repeatedly, it's very important that as a profession we do not ignore these health issues that are going on and that we need to get involved. In that way we can contribute our knowledge to a larger interdisciplinary ah, effort that's going on to address these self disparities. And frankly if we don't, we're going to be left behind, because other groups are going to be doing the work that we're very qualified to do. Also there is the mental health parity law. So right now, we have ah, higher ah, limitations on insurance that are equal to those who're physical ah, ailments in terms of what ah, insurance will reimburse. And as I mentioned a minute ago, the inter disciplinary issue is, is critical, because health disparities arise out of such complex contextual scenarios that there is just no way that one discipline alone will be able to unravel and address them. So, we need to have ah, people from various disciplines coming together, learning from each other and contributing. And my argument is there is counseling psychologist, there is a lot that we can contribute to this effort and also as clinical psychologist, you know as practicing psychologist, we have a lot to contribute. 

00:13:20
Why Counseling Psychology? • We have the tools to understand the patient in context • Take on nontraditional roles and intervene • Integrate and use educational, developmental, multicultural knowledge, awareness, and skills Source: Arredondo & Perez, 2003; Buki, 2007, Speight & Vera, 2004 

00:13:20
LYDIA P. BUKI And in particular I want to talk about, why counseling psychology should be involved in this effort. Ah... One of the hallmarks of counseling psychology is that we examine people in context. We ah, take into account everything that's going around the individual. Ah... We can take into account multicultural issues, educational issues, developmental issues, all of these are likely to have an impact on health disparities and on health outcomes. We also take on nontraditional roles to intervene, and this of course goes back to social justice, having a social justice orientation and realizing that being just a researcher or just a teacher or just a therapist is limited when we want to address certain issues that are occurring in our clients' lives that we want to change. And as I mentioned a minute ago, we also have a lot ah, knowledge base, awareness and skills in various areas including developmental psychology, educational psychology and multicultural psychology, all of which can be brought together ah, to ah, improve health disparities. And I'm gonna give some examples of my work in a minute. Okay. 

00:14:40
Social Justice Perspective • Health disparities are a remnant of the civil rights era • Area in which considerable segregation remains • Falls within CPY's social justice mandate • We have a responsibility to liberate those who are oppressed Source: Buki, 2007; Smith, 2005; Speight & Vera, 2005 

00:14:40
LYDIA P. BUKI And here specifically talking about ah, the social justice perspective. One way that we can look at disparities and health is that they're actually a renment... remnant of segregation from this, from the civil rights era. And that, there are groups of people right now, who are oppressed. As I mentioned earlier, the disparities I talked about for the most part can be eliminated. Why are they there, and why are they not been eliminated? So, if you look at this from an issue of oppression, then we can take on the role of saying well, part of our mandate is to try to liberate those who are oppressed and to free people up from these kinds of societal issues that are going on and looking at in that way, this again certainly falls under a preview to do something about as counseling psychologist. 

00:15:35
Hopps & Liu (2006) To address social justice issues in health, research is needed at 2 levels: • Individual • Systemic/Community 

00:15:35
LYDIA P. BUKI Now Hopps and Liu in the um, in the handbook of social justice ah, talked about two ways that we can address health disparities from a social justice perspective. One is by doing research at the individual level and the other one is doing research at the community or systemic level. And I'm going to be giving you examples from my research, where I’ve done this and give you a sense of what this might look like. 

00:16:00
Latinas and Breast Cancer In comparison with non-Latina White women: • Latina women are diagnosed at a younger age(51 vs 64 years old) • 20% more likely to die • 54% vs 63% localized stage • 83% vs 87.5% survivorship rate, 5-year 

00:16:05
LYDIA P. BUKI So, first just to give you ah, a sense of the area that I am going to be talk about, talking about it's about breast cancer in Latina women and you can see some of the, of the highlights there. For example, ah... Latina women are diagnosed on average at the age of 51, whereas non-Latina white women are diagnosed on average at the age of 64. There is a definitely huge disparity there. 

00:16:30
Breast Cancer among Latinas • Ranked #1 in incidence and mortality • Less likely to live 5 years beyond diagnosis • Diagnosed at more advanced stages • Diagnosed at younger ages • Appear to have a more aggressive form of the diseases 

00:16:30
LYDIA P. BUKI Latina women's are... Latina women are living ah, living shorter lives of survivors once they get diagnosed, their five-year survivorship is shorter. Ah... And they also appear to have a form of the disease that is more aggressive and what I mean by that is, is not necessarily that other types of cancer are not aggressive, but there are different types of breast cancers and for some of them we already know how to stop them and others we don't. Because we don't understand what makes them grow. And Latina women seem to have more of the type of cancer that we don't yet understand well, so we can't stop it and therefore it's more aggressive and ah, tends to have a more ah, negative impact on women's health. 

00:17:20
Mechanisms of Disparity • Late detection • Delays in follow up of abnormal mammogram • Cancer types are more aggressive 

00:17:20
LYDIA P. BUKI So you are wondering what are the mechanisms of disparity, why are we seeing these disparities in Latina women? Well, some of it is because of late detection and certainly educational frameworks, developmental frameworks, multicultural frameworks, can have an impact there. Why are women not getting their screenings? And that's a large part of the research that I do is trying to understand what are some of the psychosocial, cultural beliefs, other issues that are influencing women not getting the screenings? Ah... In terms of delays in follow up for abnormal mammograms, that is a big issue especially for immigrant women who have English as a second language or who don't speak English at all. And to give an example from one of my studies ah, I was following up with a woman, just to see if she had gone the results from the mammogram and ah, what they were and she said; "Yes, I got the results, I got this piece of paper, it was in English, I didn't understand that I put it in the drawer". I was just so pleased that she had put it at least in the drawer. So then we were able to get to her daughter and her daughter said; "Yes, I'll take a look and I'll see what it says." And sure enough, it said that there was an abnormal finding and she needed to go back in and get a follow up mammogram. Now, when I called her it was already, I think at least three months after she had, had had the mammogram, we were just doing follow ups at that time, and so she was already at least three months behind. And if I wouldn't have called her, she would have never followed up. Another example that I can give you is from ah, the work that I do in the community in Illinois. I have gone to several community centers and to places where Latinas live. Ah... One of them is a trailer park, and at this trailer park I gave presentations about the importance of screening. And I always invite the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District to come with me, because then they can give information to the women about how they, they can access free screenings after the presentation. And actually there was a line of women at the end of my presentation, waiting to talk to the Champaign-Urbana ah, Health District folks. And it was through this presentation that they were able to identify a woman who had been lost to follow up for, for an abnormal mammogram two years before. So there are lot of women who had been lost just by virtue of not understanding that they need another mammogram or not knowing what it means, moving things like that. Certainly those are psychosocial issues that we can address. Okay. Now, I also started getting interest that as I was helping women get cancers detected, what their experiences would be like once they became survivors. 

00:20:05
Psychosocial Issues in Survivorship • Access to healthcare • Delays in onset of treatment • Quality of care • Lower levels of psychosocial supports 

00:20:05
LYDIA P. BUKI And there are certainly psychosocial issues that relate to survivorship. And some of them are here, access to health care is really critical. I have interviewed women without health insurance ah, shortly after they've been diagnosed. And I can tell you that for, for me as a psychologist to say that financial assistance is not psychological, is, is, it would be a mistake, because for them having insurance is equal to having a chance for life. And so if they don't have health insurance, ah, depression sets in. I interviewed one woman who was actually had suicidal ideation at the time. Ah... She was wondering how people would take care of her kids. Ah... She didn't think she would have any options. Ah... And women who think that they may have no options, may actually not take the steps that they need to take to get better. So this is, is, is really a critical issue not having access to health care. The other point about not having access to the health care is that these women are spending inordinate amounts of energy at a time when the energy should be spent on themselves to heal and instead they're spending or trying to figure out logistics. Who's gonna take care of my kids? How am I going to arrange for transportation? How am I gonna arrange for child care and how am I gonna pay for the treatment that I have ahead of me? Delays in onset of treatment are very real and very critical. I have probably the most dramatic example, I ever heard was one woman, again in one of my studies, who was a single mother with two ah, small boys and ah, she did not have health insurance, she had an hourly type of job where they didn't provide insurance and she found out she had breast cancer, of course she was in crisis, not knowing am I gonna live or not, what stage is it and so on. She went to see the surgeon and they scheduled the surgery, and as she was walking out the door, the surgeon asked her, how are you gonna pay for this? And she hadn't even stopped to think about how she was going to pay for this. And a very proud woman, she did not feel that she was entitled to social services and didn't want to ask for help in that manner. So, it took her an entire year, before she actually got the surgery. And later she developed breast cancer for the second time, and I've talked to several oncologists about this and every oncologist believes that the fact that the first cancer was not taken out in time, probably did have an impact on her getting a second diagnosis later. Ah... The last I heard, she was doing fine. But ah, delays in onset of treatment are, can be very, very critical in our happening all the time. Quality of care is an issue, there is a vast literature especially in advanced cases of cancer, documenting the fact that ethnic minority patients tend to get ah, lower doses of pain killers. So, that's one thing to examine. Ah... And there are many other issues about quality of care, but I just wanna mention that one, because the literature by now is really robust in that area. And then of course there is issues of the lower levels of psychosocial supports. I think there is ah, there is kind of an understanding about Latino cultures tend to ah, congregate together, that people have a lot of others that they can draw strength from. But especially when you are looking at the immigrant population and if they are not English speaking, a lot of the supports that they are going to have available have as little information or access to information about breast cancer, or perhaps other types of health conditions than they do. So, having other people around doesn't necessarily mean that they're gonna have access to the information that they need and also there have been times when women have not been able to work for a while during treatment, and yes they have other people around them, but this actually taxes everyone around them especially if they are in lower income brackets, because for example, if a woman's husband has to work extra hours to makeup for her income, then her husband is gone more of the time. So, ah... So, psychosocial supports is another issue that's important. Here I want to show you some examples of research that has been done in this area, both at the individual level and at the community level. So following the, the kind of the framework from Hopps and Liu. 

00:24:45
Mental Health Needs Ell et al. (2005) Surveyed 472 women undergoing treatment • 30% women with breast cancer met criteria for moderate or major depression • Participants with major depression: √ 12% taking medication √ 5% seeing a counselor or participating in a support group 

00:24:50
LYDIA P. BUKI And ah, Kathy Ell did a study at the individual level, where she examined the psychosocial issues related to cancer survivors ah, in California. She surveyed 472 women, 79% of the sample was Latina and I, and unfortunately the, the data were analyzed together, but I feel that because about 80% of the sample was Latina, some of this would be definitely ah, ah, representative of the experiences of many Latina women. She found that 30% of the women diagnosed with breast cancer met criteria for either moderate depression or a clinical depression and yet if you look at the bottom of the slide, it is just astonishing that only 5% are getting some kind of psychosocial health. So, based on this I just also got really curious about what kinds of supports ah, do women have and I did a study that we're writing up for publication. 

00:25:50
Mental Health Needs Buki, Hinestrosa, & Grupski Needs assessment of 40 support programs • 77% reported moderate to unprecedented growth in demand for their services • Over 80% reported that the needs of LBCS were not being adequately served • Most programs rely on 'soft money' 

00:25:50
LYDIA P. BUKI I did a needs assessment of 40 community based organizations that are serving the psychosocial needs of Latina women with breast cancer. At the time, that I did the study we felt that the 40 organizations probably comprise close to 90% of the supports available nationwide ah, because we did very extensive ah, snowball sampling, we went nationally, we tapped into national organizations and got names from them. So, this is actually pretty complete sample of support programs. And what is most disturbing is that 77% of them said that they've already had unprecedented demand for their services in the last few years and 80% of them said that they were already not meeting the demands that they have as well as they could. So, I see this as a train wreck, really waiting to happen and I want to urge you to get involved. This is why I am involved is because I see that there is huge issues that are gonna be coming down the pike, especially given that Latino populations are growing so fast and this is also happening for other minority populations. So, what are we going to do? And the fact that most programs are relying on soft money is a huge problem, because I would guarantee that if try to contact some of these (inaudible ) organizations now, they probably don't exist anymore. Let me go, oops, let me go back ah, to this slide. 

00:27:20
Mental Health Needs Ashing-Giwa et al. (2004) Focus groups with 26 Latina survivors • Latinas experienced greater burden: √ Limited access to healthcare √ Lack of continuity of care √ Work disruption √ Low levels of support from family and health care providers √ Lack of access to mental health services 

00:27:20
LYDIA P. BUKI This is another example of an individual ah, study ah, Kimlin Ashing-Giwa did focus groups with 25, with 26 Latina women, and what she found, and this is something that has been found throughout the literature, is that Latina women tend to have greater burdens in a number of areas including occupational areas, social support areas, ah, financial areas. They were all ah, listed there. Problems with continuity of care. Ah... So, again this is starting to paint a picture where there is health disparities not only in, in the health outcomes, but also in psychosocial outcomes in terms of Latina survivors. And now I wanna tell you about a content analysis that we did, because I felt that I was having such difficulty bringing together the literature in this area that I decided to do a content analysis and see specifically what is there. 

00:28:20
Content Analysis 1980 - 2004 Buki, French, McCaughey, & Mayfield • 11 articles • 10 used mixed race/ethnicity samples • Most used quantitative designs • Body of work is atheoretical 

00:28:20
LYDIA P. BUKI And we found that from the year 1980 till the end of 2004, which is a 25-year period, only 11 articles were published that deal with Latina cancer survivor, breast cancer survivorship issues. There are a few more, but they, if they have Latinas in the sample they don't present information specifically for Latinas, so I felt that that was not very useful in terms of knowing what the experience of Latinas is. Of these 11 articles only one was focused on Latina women only. The other 10 articles were multiethnic samples. And most of them use quantitative designs ah, so we don't have a whole lot of information about the lived experience of women. There are some articles that have come out since then ah, that have a little bit more of the lived experiences of women, of women. And the body of work is completely atheoretical. There is nothing that connects ones study with another and after doing the content analysis it became clear to me, why I was having so much trouble trying to make sense of what was out there. Here is just to show you the years of publication. 

00:29:30
Content Analysis 1980-2004 Buki, French, McCaughey, & Mayfield 

00:29:30
LYDIA P. BUKI They're mostly starting from the year 2000 onward of those 11 articles. And what I would be really curious about is to do a public policy analysis to understand what were some societal or governmental forces that might have contributed to having ah, so little research done in this area before and more of it been done later and here I wanted to get a sense of who, where this work is being published. Because my concern is that if you look at the slide you're gonna see that there are many medical journals ah, Oncology Nursing Forum, Psycho-oncology, Annals of Behavioral Medicine, the Journal of the American ah, Women's Assoc... Medical Women's Association, the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. And not that these are not good outlets to get the work done, but this also showing you that we are not doing the work that we're prepared to do and that we have the skills to do well. So that is a concern for me, I think that we need to do more work to claim this areas when and which we have expertise and move it forward. And that's what I would like to encourage you to do today. So, I've shown you some examples of research at the individual level. Examples of research at the ah, community level. I think you can see that by doing research of both levels, you can really get a more holistic sense of what is going on with this ah, with this field then with this issue. So now, what can we do to make things better given the situation ah, that we're encountering in this case? 

00:31:10
Roles that Psychologists can Take (Buki, 2007) • Researcher • Consultant • Patient advocate • Public policy advocate • Health counselor • Training 

00:31:10
LYDIA P. BUKI And here I wanted to mention some roles that we can take to try to change things and, and ah, ameliorate health disparities in this country. One of them of course is the role of researcher, which we're very familiar with. I personally feel that the research that I do is very political, because I am giving a voice to oppress members of society. And so every time I do a qualitative study with Latina breast cancer survivors and I actually have a quote of something they said printed. That legitimizes their voice and, and makes that not so much a silence voice, but a more powerful voice. Certainly there are things we can do as consultants. I have been a consultant to the National Cancer Institute and what they wanted is for me to review the, the literature in the area of how to educate Latinos who are Spanish-speaking on cancer issues. And I wrote a white paper that subsequently was used as a basis for the new way in which now the National Cancer Institute is developing their print materials for Spanish-speaking audiences. In fact, it also was used to inform the development of their Spanish website, which is www.cancer.gov/espanol. As a patient advocate you can go with patients for example to their medical appointments and service and interpreter or service as a patient navigator. Ah... I was working with a woman who had had breast cancer twice and had had a number of issues with her last surgeon. She had told me about these issues and I just kept thinking, it can't be that it's that bad and she would always come out of the meetings not knowing what was going on, what she had, what she needed to do, what the next step was. I said, why don't I go with you to this ah, to your next appointment and I went with her to the next appointment and believe me that was much worse than what she had me was like. Ah... I could not believe in terms of all the values that I talked about initially about familismo, and respeto, and personalismo, and confianza, they were not present at all in this interaction. The surgeon was actually, the entire time right near the door with his back to the door ready to run out any minute and instead of looking at her and talking to her and for me to just be the interpreter, he was looking at me as if I was the patient. So, she felt completely invalidated and completely ignored in this situation. So I think having a patient advocate role can be very empowering and very important. You can also be a public policy advocate. Ah... I've been on panels at the Department of Health and Human Services, where I've had the opportunity to review grand proposals calls for grants actually, before they go out. And sometimes just by changing a little word here and there you can make a big difference or by saying why do you want only Universities to apply for this grant? Why don't you broaden it, so that community based organizations can apply to this grant? You know those little things that you can do that can change the policy and then can give a wider voice ah, to people who actually know what's happening where the rubber hits the road. Obviously you can be a health counselor, that's our traditional role. Ah... But in the example I gave you earlier, I think that's, this would have been a very limited role. So for example the woman who couldn't get her treatment paid for, for a year, you know, I could have been the best therapist ever and I could have sat down with her everyday and been the best listener on earth. And what she really needed was to have her surgery done and the treatment paid for. And so, I think there is a lot that we can do as, as health counselors. But getting involved in public policies really critical, because the public policy can have such a ah, an incredible influence on peoples mental health and I think that's something that we often underestimate in our profession. And then of course you can get involved in training. Ah... I am very curious as to how we can train more people who are bilingual to surface population. I am very curious as to how we can train people to use interpreters more effectively. Ah... How we can take some of the strengths that we have in, in applied psychology and bring them to the medical setting. For example, the micro skills training ah, that has been written about ah, so much Allen Ivey and, and his wife Mary Ivey ah, that is prime to just take it and, and, and move it into a medical arena and teach medical doctors, how to listen to clients, to their patients. I mean, certainly, we know how to teach people how to listen. That's something we can do.

What Can we Do? • Train more culturally competent psychologists • Train more bilingual psychologists • Conduct more research on Latina survivors • Establish more support programs

LYDIA P. BUKI So, I guess I wanted to end it. I think this is my last slide. I want to end it on a positive note in terms of what are the roles that we can take, different things that we can do to potentially have an impact and also claim a little bit of the piece of this issue because we have so much to bring to it. Ah... And with that I'll stop and I wanted to have about ten minutes for question and answer, so that's about what we have. Dr. Mevel's(ph) question is what has been my experience submitting my research for ah, for publication and, and how well it's taken? I have to say that it has not been welcomed in counseling psychology much at all and ah, even in larger psychology journals ah, I, once I had a review that said, how can you say, that this is the experience of Latina women when you don't have a, a, you know a sample of white women as well as participants in your sample. Ah... That was shocking to me, it was shocking to my students. Ah... I think we're all depressed for, for, for several weeks. Ah... There is very little understanding of what this field is like and what needs to happen and a lot of the work that I do is qualitative research and so, and there is already I think ah, questionable acceptance and understanding of qualitative research by associate editors and sometimes by editors. And so I, I feel that it has been very difficult, because in one occasion, I had a, a study that was actually published, but one of my groups was of women recently diagnosed and I only had four women in that group and I kept getting reviewers saying, well you only had for women, how can you view the range of experience that they have by only having for women. And I cannot begin to tell you how difficult it was to get the four women in the room, because unless you are maybe here in New York or Miami, you don't have the, the access to women. You know, there is not enough women to have access to and then those who are going through treatment and have layers and layers and layers of psychosocial issues going on at home, they are not gonna take time to come to participating a research study. So, you know, and, and my intent was never to have a group that would speak to issues that could be generalizable to all Latinos in the US or anything like that, I just wanted to understand their experience. So, I think there is a lot of education that needs to happen and so I've published more actually, I think in medical journals where they understand my work better than in counseling journals. And I would highly recommend ah, that being persistent as a good quality to have in, in this business, because yeah, yeah, you just, you know, and I, I keep sometimes I just have to tell myself you know, what really matters to me is how the women would judge me and the women would think that this is the very important study, so let me keep trying to get it published, so. Ah... I guess I'm trying to figure out how do I answer that without revealing ah, without revealing too much so that women could be identified. I think that you have to be ah, willing to navigate great waters. And ah... And to know what's right and to do what ethically. And ah... You know, sometimes you can encounter people who are gonna be participants in your studies who you end up seeing as a colleague, who as a advocate for breast cancer issues somewhere else. And ah... I think as long as you have your ethical sensitivity developed, you know, you are gonna do things that are going to ensure that that even if you have a relationship outside that that's ah, something that they feel comfortable with. I think probably the most ah, what I had to do one time was to tell somebody remember that I may see you outside of this context, so, and remember that you are the owner of your information, and so only tell me what you want me to know the latter. Don't tell me anything that you don't want me to know in a different context, so. And then of course, you know you do that usual ah, changing things, examples that I gave you today had been changed, ah, and, and not identifying participants in my ah, in my articles, I always say participant one, participant two, but even if participant one said two things, you know, it's still participant one all the time, because I just give them an, a participant number you know, so. Go to SHARE and go see Ivis Sampayo at SHARE, at SHARE. She is ah... She is the one who runs ah, a lot of the breast cancer support groups for Latina women. And ah, in fact they have such an incredible ah, network of, of activities that they do, that they even have, ah they even have a group specifically for women who have developed lymph edema ah, which is a condition that can happen about 30% of breast cancer cases were, if some of the lymph nodes have been taken out, then the lymph doesn't circulate freely and women can develop a swelling ah, that can actually impact quality of life and you know, may need to wear ah, different sleeves, compression sleeves and things like that, but SHARE actually has it, it's the only one I know off in the country that actually has a group specifically for women with lymph edema, so that'll be a great resource. That's a great question. So, ah, (inaudible ) is asking, how that I retool you ah, do this kind of work. It was by necessity, because ah, my first job after I got my PhD ah, I got offered a postdoctoral fellowship, where I directed a national project ah, health promotion project for Latina women without health insurance. This was in 96. And ah, being a graduate of a major research institution, the first thing I did was go to the library and try to figure out what can I find that can help me to do my work, right. And I really didn't find much at all and it was at that time, that I kind of made a personal commitment to contribute to this area in my professional life. So, along with that came trying to find, where the research is being done. And, you know through time, you just start reading more ah, articles that are published in medical journals and you get more used to the language, you get more used to the journals. You start realizing that certain journals you can't follow very well, so those are probably not hither journals, you know. And right now I'm in a department of kinesiology and community health, so you know that, that also helps a lot. What I have found is that I've been able to contribute a lot to the work that is being done in health and in community health by bringing things from a counseling psychology to that arena and at the same time I can learn a lot from them, because they have all kinds of theories of behavior change, that we have never heard of in counseling psychology and that's fascinating to me. Ah... So, yes it does take retooling ah, it does take some time, but once you can navigate both waters it just opens up so many more world, that I think it's really worth it. Thank you very much. Thanks for inviting me.
