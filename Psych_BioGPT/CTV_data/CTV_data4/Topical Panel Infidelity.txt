Topical Panel: Infidelity 

00:01:00
JEFF ZEIG Welcome to our panel discussion. 

00:01:05
moderator - Jeff Zeig, Ph.D. 

00:01:05
JEFF ZEIG We have a distinguished eminent panel who's got a lot of expertise on various aspects of our topic at hand and we have Ellen Bader and we have Janis Abrahms Spring and Michele Weiner-Davis. The topic of our panel is affairs and it's a pressing problem for clinicians and we can always learn something that could be beneficial to the couples, the individuals who we see that are troubled by this problem. So what I've done as moderator is I've asked each of the panelists to prepare a short position statement and then we'll follow that by a short dialog about those position statements among the panelists and then we'll open it up to you so that you can take advantage of the wealth of expertise that we have here and ask the questions that you need to know to improve your practice. So, I hope that format will be okay with you. Any objections? Okay. So what if we just start in alphabetical order, which would mean Janis, you'll get to start first. Will that be okay? 

00:02:15
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Actually, my last name is Spring not Abrahms. 

00:02:15
JEFF ZEIG  And then we'll follow with Ellen and then we'll follow with Michele. 

00:02:20
Janis Abrahms Spring, Ph.D. 

00:02:20
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING I've worked with couples for 37 years helping them deal with the crisis of infidelity. I have a couple of comments I want to make. They are the most obvious things that will come to mind, but they're so essential. So when I thought about what I wanted to talk about, I just want to put these points down and we can talk about anything afterwards. One of the most important things couples therapists can help their patients with after an affair is to have realistic expectations about marriage and about how couples heal after an affair. I call myself the most unromantic therapist because I think that marriage is incredibly hard work and incredibly challenging. People are swept up in romance, you come together, you think you're one, and 24 to 27 months later you realize you're not one. Not only are you not one, not only are you two, but you -- how did you miss how incredibly annoying your partner is. Managing these annoyances becomes an important part of a good marriage. There's a wonderful term by Susan Mayginnes; she talks about marriage, she talks about catastrophic dullness, I love it catastrophic dullness. These are the things that people aren't talking about and everybody especially in Westport where I live, Connecticut, has such fantasies about other people's marriages and their lives and how happy other people are and how easy it is to get along and how great their sexual relationship is. And that can lead you to trash your own when you maybe very much experience what the challenges that everybody experiences. We need to help couples realize that extraordinary trajectory in staying married, having a child with special needs, having a cancer scare, dealing with the death of a parent, figuring out what we're going to do with our careers and our lives, the pressures of the finances. You have to do everything at once, raising kids and supposedly stay sexually and emotionally connected. It's not fair. I'm going to go -- let me go really fast here. I remember when my son was in his early 20s, we went on a camping trip together with his friends and somebody had called me and asked could they buy their daughter and future son-in-law pre-marital sessions. Would I do pre-marital therapy with them? I said yes, I'd love to do that, that's a great idea. I told my son and his friends and they looked at me and they started to laugh and they said oh my God, this couple how pathetic if they have to have couples therapy before they even start the therapy they are really in trouble. Can you imagine? And I remember looking at them and thinking to myself you are so stupid. They had no clue at that age what it would mean to get married and to try to keep the marriage alive, none. Now he's got three kids and he works in the city and he lives someplace else and he's a crazy person like we all are. Okay. Just very briefly a second thought. One of the most important things we could do in helping couples is to help create a vision of their future together after an affair and I say to them that my goal is not to help them come back together again. My goal would be 10 years down the road that they see me on the street and they say Dr. Spring, remember me? You treated us when we had an affair? That they don't regret the affair because they learn lessons from the affair that they weren't confronting and they went on to have a better marriage than they had before. So, I think we have to create a vision and we have to keep them hopeful. I tell couples after the affair is revealed, after there is no contact with the affair person, it's going to be a year-and-a-half of a roller coaster ride. Let's be honest about how you two are going to feel towards each other and I say I'm going to tell you something you're going to forget it, don't forget it. There are going to be times when you feel it's hopeless, really hopeless. Every couple who's successful has to go through this, you're going to have to ride it out. I want to prepare you now, there's no quick fix and when you come around a year from now and it's the anniversary of the affair, the revelation of the affair; you're going to get reactivated, the hurt partner is going to get more brittle and it's going to be as if you've done no work at all. Be prepared, this is how people who are successful in rebuilding after an affair survive. So we need to help them know what's normal and to prepare a healthy vision for them. Okay. 

00:08:30

Ellen Bader, Ph.D. 

00:08:35
ELLEN BADER Okay. Well, I think -- I'm hoping we get into lots of good dialogs, so I'll just put out a few of my thoughts. But the biggest one is that dealing with affairs and infidelity is complex. And complexity should be the word that we all keep in mind because there's so many nuances and so many issues and it triggers things in us as therapists, it triggers enormous things in partners themselves. And when we go down that route, we're agreeing to go into a roller coaster that we don't know exactly where it's gonna go. I also think that we should realize that affairs and infidelity are not the same thing. We often use those words interchangeably. But technically an affair is a relationship, a sexual or a physical relationship between two people who are not married to each other and infidelity really has much more to do with breaking the expectation of loyalty, truthfulness, honesty when there's a reason to expect truthfulness and honesty. And I think that one of the really hard things about an affair and infidelity is that one partner in the relationship unilaterally decides to break an equilateral agreement that two people have made and once that's broken, you don't know what other decisions that person will decide to unilaterally break again and so that becomes a challenge. One other thing that I hope we talk about today cuz we don't talk about it much in professional circles is the internal life of the person who has the affair particularly when you have the couple in front of you. And I brought something today that I was just going to read a little bit from, from the perspective of the person, this is a man who had an affair. And he says "For the longest time I refused to believe that I would ever completely get over my affair and I was right, but this -- but this is because you never completely get over it instead you heal. The further you get from the affair, the less you feel the need to punish yourself for your past. Once you've reached that point, the greatest thing to seek is clarity. Gone are the days of lying to yourself which you do for so long and you become your own enabler and the affair becomes something you depend on. Trying to make sense out of abnormality will do that. But in the end when it's over, only then will you begin to understand what you thought -- what you really had to begin with. Game over." But then he goes on to talk about how for him in dealing with the affair that he'll always live with the aftermath of his decision. He says, "Affairs are shadows that lurk and haunt long after they are over. Healing is the hardest part because you're forced to confront your fucked up self. Not only are you beginning to come to terms with the mistakes you've made and why you made them, but you're learning to find a way to positively move forward with your life and try to do that without regret." So I thought he expressed a lot of that in a pretty powerful way. So, I have other things I hope we -- Oh I know! One other thing I hope we talk a bit about is actually what we do as therapists when a couple comes to you and one partner's having an affair and they want your help ending the marriage and how do you approach that couple.

Michele Weiner-Davis, MSW, LCSW 

00:12:25
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So Jeff said -- I'm Michele Weiner-Davis and Jeff said that he wants us each to have a position statement and so my position is missionary. And I'm sorry I'm just being silly because this is the third thing that I've done today and one of them was on infidelity, so I feel like I've -- sorry about the -- I've shot my wad. But in all seriousness, I've been specializing and working with couples on the brink for about three decades and it seems to me that these days mostly everybody, there's infidelity involved in almost all those situations and even the ones that aren't I think are just -- most of them are in denial and I find out later that they are too. So I've become somewhat of an expert in helping couples heal from infidelity. Years ago when I was interviewed by the media, which I was a lot, about infidelity, I had a very, very raw, raw statement about that infidelity is by no means a marital deal breaker and that when couples really do the hard work of healing from infidelity that their marriage can be even better than it was prior to the infidelity. And the metaphor that I give, I know some of you heard me say this this morning, but is that when a bone breaks; when it heals the scar tissue where it heals is actually stronger in constitution than the constitution of the bone itself. And that was the metaphor that I gave. I don't talk about it this way anymore. I certainly do believe and have been successful at helping people travel down the road to healing from infidelity, but it is a hard process. I also say infidelity is not for sissies, I mean really people have to be determined, they have to work hard. And as Janis points out about the roller coaster ride, I talk about the fact that I help people to fasten their seat belts because one of the things that I've noticed is that healing is not a straight line, there are so many ups and downs. And they might be doing really well for a period of time and then they go out to dinner and the waitress' name is Donna, Donna is the name of the woman that he had an affair with and then things are crappy for a month and then they start rebuilding again and then something else happens that triggers that same sort of response and then they're crappy for two weeks. And it's because of these ups and downs, it's very wearing. And I like that Janis points out that, you know, helping people have realistic expectations about the hopelessness that they'll feel at those plateaus or at those dips is one thing. I really want, it's the therapist whose hope level I want to be maintained during those junctures when couples come to us and they think there's something really wrong with their marriages and that they really don't need to try anymore because they've hit these low points so many times. That's when we as therapists often become hopeless and I want to normalize that for all of us who work with those couples. Those are the times that we just need to have the mantra of asking people so what do you need to do to get back on track or what have you done to get back on track, what do you need to do the moment that you leave the session today. So that's one point that I want to make. The other point that I want to make is there's this whole new trend I think in the field of infidelity to really encourage those of us who work with couples to be a little bit less myopic and little bit less parochial and to perhaps adopt some of the philosophies of more open-minded cultures, European cultures when it comes to infidelity. And in theory that sounds really good to me, but I have to tell you in my practice, those people aren't coming to my practice, they maybe coming to someone else's practice, but they're not coming to me. I'm finding people who especially when they come to me early on in the discovery of infidelity that much of what they're experiencing looks a whole lot like PTSD. They can't eat, they can't sleep, they can't think, they can't function, and they're not particularly open to redefining more open ways of thinking about marriage and I know that I might be in the minority these days. But I just have to tell you with all due respect this is what I'm seeing in my practice, so maybe we can have a conversation about that as well. 

00:17:00
[sil.] 

00:17:05
JEFF ZEIG It's very difficult to hear because the speakers are directed out so I sat in the audience. Okay. So is there some reaction about some of the issues among the panelists that have been brought up? No, I was thinking among you before we got to questions. 

00:17:25
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING  Just a point in how many of you were in the cyber sex lecture? Okay. Okay. Well, just the point is that there are different camps about how much openness is healthy for the couple and secrets and experimentation and there are -- there are infidelity experts such as Esther Perel who would talk about the importance of fire needing air and having openness and people are negotiating for that because they believe that it will allow them actually to feel closer to their partners. And then you have other infidelity experts like Susan Johnson whose research is finding that when women feel threatened, their amygdala hippocampus the alarms go off and they shut down and they're less able to have orgasms and less interested in sex and these are two very different camps in the field. 

00:18:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So would you say which camp you're in? 

00:18:50
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING The camp I'm in is where my patients camp and if they want to have openness and they want to swing or do whatever they want to do and it's working for them, they don't come to see me. I only see the problems and that's when these two people want different things and the alarms are going off. 

00:19:10
ELLEN BADER  So one of the things that I think is that we, all of us sitting up here, are from a western culture and most of our patients are from this culture, the majority of them not all. And we grew up with a puritan aspect and that's embedded in most of the people that we see. I don't condemn and I don't condone people having affairs, I think it creates enormous like you said upheaval and trauma in the relationship particularly depending on the kind of deception that has gone on. I've also worked with poly-amorous couples who are some of the healthiest people I've ever worked with and who are able to have multiple sexual partners. I also worked with gay men who are able to navigate that terrain in a very different way than heterosexual couples are able to navigate that terrain. And so I think it -- like I said when I started, I think it's an enormously complex topic and that I sit in sessions with trying to really make the space for both people's voices to be heard and for the couple to be able to talk about all the different aspects of it. And some of the couples who have done the best and strongest healing are those who have been able to talk about what the affair meant to them and why they had it and the aliveness that it brought to them or how it helped them in some way, how it was a way of staying committed to the marriage in an odd way because they didn't want to leave the partner, but the partner had checked out or was unavailable for whatever reasons the partner had checked out. And so, it's not simple, its very complicated. 

00:21:00
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS  And along those lines, I think I agree with you that it's really important to be able to -- for the couples to be able to talk about what part of them came alive during an affair. But there's also a pre-supposition there that an affair is an indication of a bad marriage and the research has shown beyond the shadow of a doubt that it isn't necessarily so that there are many, many people who have affairs who describe their marriages as happy places to be. So, it's important to remember that as well. 

00:21:35
JEFF ZEIG So does anybody want to pick a thread that Ellen brought up. Assuming that this is a couple that is in couples therapy and one of the partners has an affair and says I want to use that as an opportunity to leave the marriage, what does the therapist do? 

00:21:50
ELLEN BADER  Well, I'm raising that both in terms of them coming in and them saying that and also like I'm particularly working this with a couple of couples right now where somebody has decided to leave and they are really going to leave so that's also the case. But they don't want to deal with any of the havoc that they've brought in the end, but still want to leave and still want to have amicable divorces and still want things to be good with the kids. And whereas a therapist you have to take I think kind of a strong stand and say if you want that good outcome where it's not going to filter down for years in devastating ways with your kids, you've got a lot of repair work to do even if you are getting a divorce and you've got a lot of commitments that you still have to honor here in terms of dealing with the repercussions of what you've been doing. But I like to -- I mean I'd like to talk about it because I don't know, I think -- I don't know whether people just kind of accept it when somebody comes in and they say they're leaving. Do you let them leave, do you work with the other person, do you try to insist on couples sessions, do you--? 

00:23:05
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS What I don't get is why are they coming to you if they are wanting to leave their marriage, they should go to the attorney down the hall. I mean I used to share a waiting room with an attorney and -- a divorce attorney and we always joked about the fact that we should have a sign in the waiting room with arrows pointing in the opposite direction; one said mend them, the other said end them or make up, break up. I mean I'm joking, but I really think that why are they coming to a therapist when they think they're convinced that they want to end the marriage, they should just be going to a divorce attorney unless they're actually not as convinced as they appear to be. 

00:23:40
ELLEN BADER  Let me give a quick answer to that. I think sometimes there are people who are committed to ending it who really mean it, but they know there's so much hostility and animosity and that is going to impact their kids and so they're willing to do something to try to deal with that amount of hostility that they're leaving behind. 

00:24:05
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING I'm thinking of a situation where somebody has an affair and they are deeply in love with this person and they want to get out of the marriage, well there are things that they could to earn their partner's forgiveness still. They could give them a very generous financial settlement and child custody settlement. These are not small details to negotiate and those are often, you know, the divorce is just the beginning of the very vicious fight. And so there are other ways that the unfaithful partner can be apologetic or responsible or loving or fair at the very least. 

00:24:55
JEFF ZEIG Okay. We have a question, a couple of questions, more questions. So Gary, we'll start in the back. 

00:25:00
  I just have a comment. I think one reason they come sometimes too is because they want to, um, they still have feelings for the person and want to drop them off in the loving arms of a therapist who can take care of them and help get the other spouse through the situation. 

00:25:25
ELLEN BADER So do you refuse to let them drop them off? 

00:25:30
  No, I help them do their work and do their job of, you know, whatever they have to do to deal with their kids and all of the different things that they have to deal with and sometimes that leads to reconciliation. 

00:25:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS You know what? For me as long as and I think some of you heard me say this. As long as there's a warm body in my room I look at it as an opportunity to see whether there's a crack in the veneer so that I can wiggle my way in there and get them to look at the possibilities for making their marriages work even if what they're thinking when they enter therapy is that they might possibly want out. If they're there and they care enough about their spouse to drop them off in loving arms, that's enough caring to begin to see if there's some possibilities for change. 

00:26:25
JEFF ZEIG Okay. We have a question here and then bring the microphone up here. 

00:26:30
 I'm wondering what position you would take if you had one partner come in and tell you they were having an affair, but their partner didn't know. What would you counsel them with? 

00:26:50
[sil.] 

00:26:55
ELLEN BADER  Well, I mean first off it's a whole different issue. Are you talking about them coming to see you as an individual client and that they want you to help them figure out what they want to do or are they wanting couples therapy or are they wanting to begin to look at the issues or are they willing to work with their partner? I mean there's lot of questions, it's had to answer given that kind of a --? 

00:27:20
 Do you want me to be more specific? 

00:27:25
ELLEN BADER That'd be great. 

00:27:25
 Okay. Well, I have a couple that came to me and she did have an affair and he caught her and they came and we did repair work and they were doing just fine. The woman continued to come to me for about a month or two and just recently she told me that she started seeing her lover again and now she thinks she wants out of the marriage. But she'll give me a whole list of why her husband is a nice guy, he's just not that exciting and she gets very excited with her lover and she's afraid that her husband is going to find out. 

00:28:10
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Yeah, yeah. I have what I -- for those who weren't in the last talk, I have what I call an open secrets policy which means from the very first contact, both partners understand that I will keep secrets -- keep secrets openly meaning that both of them understand and agree to the policy that one will tell me something, I will know it and not tell the other unless it's a threat to actual life, which by federal law I can't keep the secret. And so that person's ambivalence and distress about whether to go with the lover or with the marriage partner is the therapy and they need to be seen individually I think to resolve that ambivalence and to be able to talk openly in a way that they wouldn't in front of their partner. 

00:29:00
 Well, that is what is going on, but I don't know. I guess it's my old training about being in order to work on the marriage, everybody has to be honest except I don't actually believe that people should just dump that on their partner to make themselves feel better like the confession if you know that your partner's going to be devastated. So, I'm really torn personally as to which way to go with her. 

00:29:40
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Well, you're bringing up a very interesting point because you as the therapist have the ambivalence about whether or not it's good for her to tell. On the one hand you don't want to hurt the other partner, on the other hand you feel it's fair for him to know the truth. It's interesting you're dealing with your own ambivalence and as therapists of course we do have feelings and ideas about our patients. But it's really not about our ambivalence, it's really about the patients and they need or she needs to understand the advantages and disadvantages of telling her husband the truth. It maybe to her advantage, there maybe more advantages. 

00:30:20
 He already told her that if she did it again, he would leave her. 

00:30:20
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING  Okay. 

00:30:25
JEFF ZEIG Okay. Let's move on and then please take that microphone over here. 

00:30:30
ELLEN BADER Jeff, can I add one thing? 

00:30:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS  Jeff, we'd both like to respond to that. 

00:30:40
JEFF ZEIG I'm sorry. 

00:30:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Jeff, we'd both like to respond to that. 

00:30:45
ELLEN BADER Yes, so I just wanted to say that I have -- I really love Janis' open secrets policy and that she was the first one in the field who had the guts to put it out there so I think we all owe Janis a lot for doing that. Um I have a -- and I have a slightly different policy. No, it's an and because I actually basically think yours is best. However I still have a slightly different one, which is I give the couple the choice. So when I meet with a couple at the beginning of therapy, I give them the choice and I lay out both choices. There is a choice to have open secrets and I tell them why I prefer that and why I like that, but also there can be the possibility of no confidentiality and that I want them in front of me to discuss it and to work it out and to decide how they want it handled and then all of us then have an agreement about what that is. And I think in your situation when you know what your commitment is with that couple and what you've agreed to, it takes that ambivalence away even though it means it's not an easy thing to do. 

00:32:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And I would just like to add one thing to that. How many people were in my infidelity workshop today? So, you already know what I'm going to say about this. But I also agree to open secrets and that one of the reasons I kind of got there by trial and error because I used to insist on disclosure and what I found is that disclosure really was a fabulous thing for some couples, that it was a turning point in therapy where they finally felt like the cards were on the table, we knew what we were dealing with and now honesty begins and that the healing began. But for other couples, it truly ended their relationship and in a way I felt somewhat culpable because I didn't know that it would end the relationship, I wasn't sure. And I can tell you that with all my knowledge about people and how they change, I can't predict in advance who's going to end their marriage and who's going to get better as a result of the disclosure. So, I'm not willing to take that responsibility. So, I will hold those secrets with the idea that I will continue to work with them as long as there seems to be movement and improvement and eventually the ending of the affair. It's an uncomfortable place for me to be. If it gets too uncomfortable, I bow out; but until that time I will continue to work with them. I think it's a very difficult part of this process regardless of what decision that you make. 

00:33:40
 Thanks. It's my turn. Was I going to say something? I don't remember. Just kidding. There's been so much said today and I've sat through two of Michele's seminars and the other seminar, you know, listening to all of this. And I wonder if we've got to look back at not just couples counseling when their, you know, the marriage is on the brinks, but what about the pre-marital side or the side where we talk about what's a healthy marriage and marriage classes or, you know, what the church tries to do, you know, which is basically instill their beliefs on what a couple should do prior to marriage but it's probably too late by the time they've made a marriage commitment or become engaged. And then there's again lesbian issue, where gay men have a whole different philosophy, um, women tend to, you know, do certain things and, you know, men want to go out and look, and can we say it's biological, can we not. There's so many issues to look at that I don't know if it's just -- I mean I think it's good to look at couples counseling to help them to stay together, I believe that's good. But there's things that happen before things fall apart that they can learn like how many people lie to their spouses not even about an affair, they lie about other things that screw things up and cause a lot of problems or, you know, where we were talking about -- I think it was with Harriett with the triangle and the--. 

00:35:40
JEFF ZEIG Okay. Hold on because you're doing a great job of clarifying your thinking and you need to work to clarify your thinking and parse that down. So, let's try to get some questions to the audience that are specific to working with affairs, but I like what you're trying to do which is, this is a complex issue, complex is the name of the game and trying to tease out and focus. 

00:36:05
ELLEN BADER Well, in fact Helen Fisher would say that infidelity is a biological strategy that you -- that is evolutionary across many species. Yes, I mean it's a reproductive strategy that you sow your seed with one person, but then you sow it over here on the side just in case to ensure that your genes will last through different generations. 

00:36:30
JEFF ZEIG  Please? 

00:36:35
 Well, I have a question, but I'm aware we haven't really finished the topic that Ellen had brought up and I'd be more interest -- I'd be interested in pursuing that also. But my question is Michele, just coming back to your video this morning about that woman, I can't remember her name, but her husband was Gary. So if you help a woman who's had an affair go back to her marriage so she goes back to Gary, uh, dumps the affair, it's over, she's rebuilding her relationship with her husband. Does that affair have to come up? What is your position on that, each of you? Do I need to disclose this at some point to really have a connection? What is that shame or that secret doing between me and my husband if that's the case? So do you bring that up and say, you know, eventually you will have to disclose or you leave it or just aside? 

00:37:45
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS  Are you asking about this particular person or just in general? 

00:37:50
  No, in general, but she was the perfect example. 

00:37:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS  Yes. So my reaction -- since it was my case that one of the things that I've learned over the long time that I've been working with people is this whole idea of complexity and individual differences and it's enhanced the respect that I have for really tailoring what I do to the individual sitting in my office. And I think that for some people needing to share that information, it would haunt them if they didn't and for others, it would haunt them if they did. And so I honor what people are telling me and I take it at face value and I don't presume that I know better than they do what's good for them so I will go with what it is they're saying they need. 

00:38:45
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING I think one way of looking at it is there are advantages and disadvantages to telling and not telling and they have to be assessed for each couple or each partner of the couple. An advantage of telling is you don't live with the guilt and you level the playing field, you give your partner the same information you have, it's maybe a sign of respect if you allow them to make decisions based on all that you know, all that's transpired between the two of you. A disadvantage maybe that it creates an obsessive preoccupation with the affair, that's all they think about, they're devastated, they never recover from it, the couple never goes on to address the issues between the two of them. So, I think that those have to be weighed out. 

00:39:35
ELLEN BADER  I would add one more thing, which I mean I basically agree with the other two, but I think it's a very different situation when the person who is having the affair has been suspected by the partner and they've asked and they've been lied to and they've been told, you know, you're crazy or you're making this up. In that case, I think the coming clean is really essential and the person looking at their own character issues in terms of why they would make a partner feel crazy and hide at that level. 

00:40:10
JEFF ZEIG  Yes, Sandy. 

00:40:15
SANDY I'm curious, this has happened so many times in my practice over decades where it's not an affair, it's a series of infidelities and it has a compulsive nature to it. And I'm curious what your thoughts on when it becomes compulsive or process addiction, the other name for it is sexual addiction and where you make that distinction each of you and if you use any adjunct with that in any like 12-step programs or what you do with that one, serial infidelities. 

00:40:50
ELLEN BADER You just asked a whole day workshop with your question. 

00:40:50
SANDY Yes, no kidding. 

00:40:55
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING  Just briefly I'll say, you know, the nature of compulsive activity is that it's out of control without regard for consequences and so--. 

00:41:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS  And I would just add that very simply when a person really wants to stop and feels that they can't, that they make promises to themselves that this is not going to happen again, but it happens again and again and again. 

00:41:30
JEFF ZEIG Okay. Who's got next? 

00:41:35
 Okay. So I want to go back to your question, Ellen, it's sort of going to get back to that, which I've had the experience many times like you, Michele, where I'm rooting for the marriage even though they come in and they say I'm done, I'm finished. I mean I would do it with an affair or any issue so I take the same stance kind of trying to mobilize and see what can be done and actually a lot of the time even with affairs, people end up realizing that they don't want to or need to leave. But I've had the other experience of people coming in and saying I'm definitely leaving, but I really want to -- it's like what you said, Ellen, like I really just want to have like an amicable divorce and I really want to do it. But actually maybe I'm cynical, but what I think they're saying is I really just want my partner to get over this really quickly so that I can get on with my happy life and so that's basically kind of what I wanted to toss in. Yes, there's the leave it in happy -- leave with a loving person. 

00:42:40
ELLEN BADER And going along with that is there's often that sense of they hope they can skate through the therapy with getting the partner over it as quickly as possible and the therapist is in a position of having to do a lot of ongoing confrontation about their role in the whole process at that point. 

00:43:05
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Something I'm going to be talking about tomorrow in the forgiveness course is that there is a difference between earning forgiveness and reconciliation. Earning forgiveness would be for past wrongs, reconciliation has to do with the future of the relationship. So, it is possible for two people to get together, the unfaithful partner to listen to the hurts of the hurt partner and to listen with an open heart and to offer meaningful apology and to take responsibility for their share of the demise of the marriage. Without reconciliation, there's no hope for the future. They're going to get divorced, but they are going to stay together because they share these kids for example. And so the forgiveness, the earning forgiveness piece is essential to the well being of that union, but it's not about reconciliation so sometimes it's helpful to separate those two. 

00:44:05
 I'd like to have you speak to the concept you raised that a lot of times when this first hits the fan that it's like PTSD for the family. How much and what style do you find effective to give some time for the grieving of the impact of this to use the Boston expression, the bomb that went off? And I'm intrigued by it because my dissertation was high conflict divorce, I'm not seeing that divorce really generated any peace in most of all the research I did so it's like I'm really wanting to know how to help people move past the affairs if it's an affair and how do you handle the grieving because that's so incredibly important. Even if they choose to separate, they have to know how to grieve. So how do you guys handle that? 

00:45:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, in regards to the so-called PTSD symptoms, I can't emphasize this enough. I said this earlier that one of the most powerful things that we can do as therapists not just when it comes to affairs, but other things as well, is to normalize, normalize, normalize. To let people know that what they're experiencing with they can't think, they can't eat, they can't focus, they can't work, they have trouble taking care of their kids, they can't do anything. That sometimes I say if you were feeling anything but that, I'd check you into the nearest mental hospital. Of course, you're going to be feeling this way. And a lot of times when people come in even if it's six months, a year, or even after the discovery and they're still struggling; I will tell them this is hot off the press. I will make sure that they know that if they haven't gotten help and if they haven't really addressed these issues, there's no reason for them to be feeling anything but what they're feeling and that is an integral part of what I do throughout the entire process is normalize, it's so important. 

00:46:20
ELLEN BADER It's normalizing, it's educating, and it's providing safety and structure at the very beginning. I mean one of the things that I say to people often is you think you can handle and deal with all these things you want to talk about and you're putting a hundred things on the table in the first few weeks after this has come out and you've got to slow things down and then take it a step at a time and I'll be here with you, we'll do it together. But it's too much to try to take it on all at once. 

00:46:50
 One of the common themes -- I'm over here. One of the common themes that come up often in couples therapy is the affixation on the object of the infidelity, the third party or fourth party or fifth. And I'm curious what you’re thinking might be about how you work with maybe unwitting accomplices to an affair. The person that didn't know he or she was married, the one that comes in and perhaps is remorseful, regretful, betrayed. Do you do any work with the other party? 

00:47:30
[sil.] 

00:47:40
ELLEN BADER Again, I mean to me that question is complicated because of course if that partner comes in to see me for individual therapy, I'm going to do all kinds of work with them. If you're talking about who they are in the context of another couple I'm seeing, it totally depends and it's individualized. I've had that third person in the room, I've also coached a couple on how to go through a process of what they are saying and how they're dealing with the way that third person is interfering in their relationship at this point. So, there's just so many different pieces to what you're asking. 

00:48:15
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING  I say that there really isn't a good book that I know of written for the affair person. And I've often been asked are you going to write a book for the affair person because it's a trauma for them too and often they get a really raw deal. They were told lies, maybe the unfaithful partner told them that they had left their partner, they were going to get divorced anyway, and they love, they open their heart, and they get crucified. So, they go through their own trauma and grief. 

00:49:00
 In looking at the unfaithful partner and Michele's video today with the lady who was discussing struggling with leaving the affair and then or staying in the marriage. What kept coming to my mind was the avoidance of not wanting to face maybe her true self of like this is not who I really am, but this is what I've done and I don't want to face the consequences of those behaviors. And so I was wondering if you guys being so engrained, do you feel like some people stay in affairs or don't want to tell their partner because they don't want to face the true self of their consequences? Does that make sense, the question? 

00:49:45
ELLEN BADER I mean that makes sense and that's kind of what was in the thing I read at the beginning, which is part of moving beyond an affair is facing what you were capable of doing that you didn't think you were capable of doing and recognizing that in yourself. I've worked with many people who had affairs who don't want to go there and yet that's a very -- that being able to go there at the level of I'm sorry that says I really did jeopardize our future, I jeopardized our kids' future, I did things that I did not think I was capable of doing, but I did them actually over time makes that person more able to handle the triggers that come up for their spouse. But when that's defended against and never dealt with, I think they have a harder time each time a trigger surfaces. 

00:50:45
 My question has to do with sort of the tail to the secret question. I'm wondering about your experience when you hold the secret because I've been doing this for 36 years and I kind of go back and forth too. But when you hold the secret, my experience has been that oftentimes at some point the partner finds out whether it's now or ten years down the way and I've had clients of course come into the office that are still upset or are upset about an affair that they've just learned about. So is there a way to do some damage control about that risk that you take when you hold the secret that it's going to be there with the couple? Makes sense. 

00:51:25
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING You have to let them know from the very first contact that you have an open secrets policy and you spell it out. That means your partner may tell me something, I will know it and not tell you. That means you may tell me something, I will know it and not tell them. It's very important that they're clear and they're in agreement, otherwise they will feel more betrayed by you than by the affair person. Yes. 

00:51:55
ELLEN BADER And that's exactly why I went to adding that other part to my policy, which is because I felt like when I was making it completely open secrets that I was imposing that. I'm very clear with people I prefer that, but I also don't want to impose that on somebody who maybe grew up in a family where they had to contend with secrets from parents and that kind of betrayal from the therapist makes them unable to come back to the therapy. 

00:52:25
  We heard from Michele about how she decided to move in the direction of the open secret approach and I wondered if the rest of the panel could talk about that as well because for my career, I've always worked with a full disclosure model and when I've considered --. 

00:52:45
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING Could you raise your hand so because we can't -- oh, fine. 

00:52:45
 And when I've considered doing otherwise, I always felt like maybe I would be sort of playing God in a way and I get that by telling them upfront you let them make choices, but I still feel sort of some ambivalence and I'm intrigued and I'd like to hear just more about how the decisions were made for each of you about deciding to do it this way. 

00:53:10
ELLEN BADER  I mean I moved in that direction when I had been lied to one too many times and I realized that I just would be a much more effective therapist if I knew what was going on and then I didn't want to create a culture that reproduced the lying that had already been going on ahead of time that I wanted to be in a different position than the person who was being lied to. 

00:53:40
JEFF ZEIG You in the back? 

00:53:40
JILL Yes. I have a question about if violence erupts in the session --. Oops, I'm sorry. 

00:53:45
JEFF ZEIG Where are we? Who's asking the question? 

00:53:50
JILL Sorry, here. Hi, I'm Jill. And I have a question about if violence erupts in the session after a disclosure, that's something that happened to me recently and took me completely off guard. It wasn't even a disclosure of an affair, but it was just a disclosure that he wanted to move out and stay out, to have a separation. And I was just wondering, curious if any of you have dealt with that and how you've dealt with it. And when I say violence, I mean not just like throwing a cup, that was the first part of it, she threw a cup and then fell to the floor kicking and screaming and ran towards my window to jump out. 

00:54:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Could you say what you just said again, I couldn't understand it? 

00:54:40
JILL Okay. When I say violence, I mean what happened was she threw a cup at him and I actually separated them, I had him leave the room; but then she fell to the floor kicking and screaming and ran towards my window to jump out. 

00:54:55
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING  That's bad. 

00:55:00
ELLEN BADER And I'm lucky I'm not you. 

00:55:05
JILL It was bad and it was also completely completely unexpected. There was no history of it, there was just no history of personality disorder that I mean I could see. I mean it just totally, totally took me off guard. 

00:55:20
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS So what did you do? 

00:55:20
JILL  Well, I mean I separated them because I thought she was going to punch him, I thought she was going to punch me. But he went in the other room and then she had this episode and ran towards the window and she flew -- she just ran out. After that whole episode, she ran out of the office and I called her and she alternated between hysterics and rage and I was considering whether I was going to call the PET team, but she assured me that she was not actually suicidal, she wouldn't do it and gave me her word. I talked to her that night, I called CAMFT in the morning and it was clear that they were not going to come back. I offered them each an individual session and never heard from them again and never got paid. 

00:56:15
ELLEN BADER That's the worst part of it she never got paid. 

00:56:20
JILL  So I was just wondering, I mean I'm sure there are a lot of disclosures and you say that you've learned sort of by trial and error; if you've ever experienced anything like that before because I haven't in 13 years. 

00:56:35
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS  No. 

00:56:40
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING I mean you're describing a therapist nightmare, right. So I just think that for all of us if we think there's any potential for that kind of violence, we'd never put these two people together in a room. 

00:56:50
JILL Right, absolutely. I mean it was clear that she was not ready to be in couple’s therapy. She couldn't handle him expressing himself and again, it wasn't even a disclosure of an affair, it was just how he was feeling, which was just so unusual to me how that happened. 

00:57:10
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING There's somebody in Westport who really, really loves to deal with violent couples and so whenever I sense that, I send them to him. 

00:57:15
JILL  Okay. Thank you. 

00:57:20
JEFF ZEIG So we have time -- it's clearly the right panel and the questions have been fabulous and clearly there's so many, but we only have time for one more. 

00:57:25
  Yes. Coming from a full disclosure perspective, I'm so curious about the open secrets model and I'm wondering how you do couple therapy while someone's having an affair. Do you deal with each person individually? What goes on in the couples session with both in the room and how can you make progress if there are dual attachments that one person is having? 

00:57:50
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Well, you should have attended my infidelity workshop this morning. 

00:57:55
 I did. 

00:57:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS Oh, you did. 

00:57:55
 I still have the same question. 

00:57:55
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And you're still asking that question. You have to stay after class. The video that I showed, did that not answer the question? 

00:58:05
 Well, that seemed like your best case scenario because she decided pretty quickly to end the affair, but what if it goes on for months and months. My experience is people once they're stuck, they don't make decisions that quickly, they don't want to give up either and it just goes on forever. 

00:58:20
JANIS ABRAHMS SPRING The truth is if one partner is secretly lying and continuing to see the affair person whether you have an open secrets policy or a different policy, nothing good is going to happen in that marriage. So it's just a question of whether you as the therapist are going to know the truth and you can then manage that truth between the two of them. 

00:58:40
ELLEN BADER  Also you can keep doing more individual sessions with that person. I like to use a lot of gusto work in terms of dialoging between the part of him that wants to stay and the part that wants to leave and trying to work with the ambivalence. But also if you're doing a lot of individual sessions with one person, the partner's going to say hey, what's going on and that also starts to heat things up and bring things more out into the open. 

00:59:10
MICHELE WEINER-DAVIS And I guess the only other thing I'd like to say about your comment. It was the best case scenario because within a session she decided to stop seeing the other partner. It was the best case scenario, but I actually think I had a little something to do with it the way that I worked with her and I just focused on when she --. For those of you who weren't there, a woman who was in the midst of an affair, she was coming in for couples counseling. The couples counseling wasn't going very far so I split them up because I wanted to know what was going on and when I met with her alone, she did admit that she was having an affair and I tried several times in my work with her to get her to think about ending the affair and I got a very clear stop sign this is not going anywhere, I'm not ready to give it up. And so finally she said something like I can't believe that I'm doing this because my first husband did this to me. And I said to her that must be really, really hard for you. She goes it is really hard and she started to talk about how badly she feels about herself as a person and then I started to talk about her integrity and how difficult a position this must be for her and very gradually she -- it literally was one session where she started to decide that she wasn't so sure she needed to see this guy for an extended period of time. She'd kind of quit contact with him. So there are different ways that you can work with people that don't pressure them, but to focus on the part of them that they're ambivalent, the part of them that really their integrity in the matter and her integrity is what showed up and she decided to quit seeing him. 

01:00:50
JEFF ZEIG Okay. Great appreciation, wonderful session. Thank you so very much. Thanks to the panelists.
