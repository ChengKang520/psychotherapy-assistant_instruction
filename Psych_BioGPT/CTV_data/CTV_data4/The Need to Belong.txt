THE NEED TO BELONG 

00:00:15
WITH MAUREEN MOORE 

00:00:15
THE NEED TO BELONG 

00:00:40
MAUREEN MOORE In the film, that follows, my work with a client focuses on her need to belong. In this case, the experience of not belonging, was in relation to race and ethnicity. However, the sense of not belonging can be at the core or our being, or can relate to family connections, the working environment, age group, cultural settings or even choice of career. For example, someone who enjoys and is happy with technical or practical activities, may feel that they do not belong in the academic setting of a university. That feeling of belonging is an essential component of our well being and identity. The difficulty is that from a early stage in our development, social expectations and experiences impact on our sense of who we are in ways that change who we are to who we should be. The struggle then is to claw one's way back to the first position and to feel it and to know it with conviction. 

00:02:05
THE NEED TO BELONG 

00:02:05
MAUREEN MOORE The need to belong has long been identified as a part of the developmental process. Not surprisingly, feeling that we belong affects our sense of security, how accepted we feel socially, and our self acceptance and confidence. Abraham Maslow identified belonging as an instinctual need. If he was right, then we will be driven to seek to belong. When we feel that we belong, we are more likely to believe that we are loved, that we are safe, and that we are not alone in an alien world. Not belonging creates and maintains its own vicious circle. People respond to the feeling of not belonging in different ways. We may begin to believe that we are and at times, others are not likable. We may also strive to set up structures to help us to belong like always being a social secretary. Alternatively, we may create defensive strategies to protect us against the painful feelings associated with not belonging. For example, choosing to spend all spare time at work. In the process, we often destroy the very opportunities and attachments which may be helpful. If the emotional pain of not belonging continues over time, we can become fine tuned to that negative message and begin to interpret some life events as rejections. It colors our perception and how we experience our world. We also tend to construct our lives to conform to our mental picture of what we expect that life will be like. Some people refer to this pattern as the self fulfilling prophecy.The purpose of this session is to explore the meaning of the clients experiences in relation to her need to belong. Counseling has a lot to offer to someone who is on this journey. The process offers opportunity to talk in an open way about experiences, feelings, beliefs, and hopes without being judged. The client has a sense of being accepted and understood by another person. The therapeutic relationship created between client and counselor provides the opportunity to investigate alternative perceptions safely and to arrive at a new understanding through reflection. In order to achieve this I facilitated a relationship which offered nonjudgmental attention, empathetic understanding, acceptance and respect for all her feelings, efforts, hopes and experiences. As a counselor, it is important to be clear about what you believe to be helpful to the therapeutic process. I adhere to an approach that recognizes the clients motivation to address their issues. I believe that the client is capable of achieving her potential if she has the opportunity to experience a genuine relationship that allows her to explore insights that support her efforts. I also feel sure that if I interpreted her world from my perspective, not only would I get it all wrong, but she would again be in a position in the micro-world of the counseling room, where she would not be in control of her world. Primarily, I had to offer a congruent person to person experience to support the belief that you can safely be who you are. 

00:07:00
MAUREEN MOORE Hello, Jay. 

00:07:05
JACINTA POWELL Hi. 

00:07:05
MAUREEN MOORE Hi. It's nice to see you again. Um, we met last week about the same time and just as you were leaving you mentioned something about, uh, moving to London and not feeling to happy about it and I just wondered if, uh, we could use this time to talk about that. 

00:07:25
JACINTA POWELL Yep. 

00:07:25
MAUREEN MOORE Yeah, tell me a little bit about what happened and what you expected. 

00:07:30
JACINTA POWELL Well, um, I came from Somerset, which is, I came from Glastonbury, a really small town, it's like 10,000 people and um, being from a mixed race background myself, my mother is Indian and my father is white, um, I've never quite sort of belonged in, like, a group, like a white group, or an Indian group, or in Glastonbury, especially, there aren't any other. There's, I think I can think of one other black family , so it was always quite hard for me, because I didn't ever feel 100% like I did sort of fit in. I did, I was happy, but at times, it would cross my mind, like, because I'm not white and I did experience racial, um, racism at school, um, and then, I really wanted to move to London, because , um, it's such a diverse city. There's so much to do. There's so many different , um, like people from different backgrounds, um, and then I moved there. I've been living there for six months now. I live in Peckham and it's, um, it's a black area mostly, but other people live there and um, once again, I feel like I don't have a place, because I think, I think, to them, I'm looked at as a white girl and that's, you know, and I have experienced sort of racism through that, through being white, whereas, when I was at home, I experienced racism because I wasn't white and so it's just sort of put me in. I mean, I'm happy, but it's just sort of put me in this my own bubble, in a way. Like, where do I belong? 

00:09:20
MAUREEN MOORE Yeah, okay. Throughout the work with this client, I take care to clarify what the client has said and to increase understanding for both of us. Focusing on the client and her story, as well as my own feeling help me to be aware of expressed or unexpressed emotion. I was aware that particular attention needed to be given to checking meaning and to clarify. Jay's reference to the bubble suggests a sense of feeling alone. I felt that she would benefit from a real relationship in our work. One in which she could experience my presence with her, so that she wasn't just an object isolated in her own bubble. 

00:10:25
MAUREEN MOORE So, it sounds as if when you were in Glastonbury, you said there were no black families, so. 

00:10:30
JACINTA POWELL There was one. 

00:10:30
MAUREEN MOORE There was one black family? 

00:10:30
JACINTA POWELL (crosstalk) In the whole of, my town, but. 

00:10:35
MAUREEN MOORE So, do I take from that, that you would have been, uh, would have felt more at home, if there were more black families? 

00:10:40
JACINTA POWELL Well, or, or, just Chinese families, Indian families, just. 

00:10:45
MAUREEN MOORE All right. 

00:10:45
JACINTA POWELL Families from different cultural backgrounds I suppose. 

00:10:50
MAUREEN MOORE Mm, yeah. 

00:10:50
JACINTA POWELL Yeah, definitely. 

00:10:50
MAUREEN MOORE So you didn't feel at home in the totally white community? 

00:10:55
JACINTA POWELL Yeah, especially at school. 

00:10:55
MAUREEN MOORE (crosstalk) Okay, especially at school. 

00:10:55
JACINTA POWELL (inaudible one of the only colored children. I hate using that word, but around your school you do, it does play on your mind, especially, kids can be nasty and they can throw racist abuse at you and it's completely always off the mark, as well, especially in Somerset, people are so uneducated about different cultures. Really, I could see that once I moved to London, that they're throwing abuse at you, but it doesn't even relate to you in the first place, but it's still hurtful. 

00:11:30
MAUREEN MOORE I am absolutely sure it's very hurtful. 

00:11:30
JACINTA POWELL Mm-hmm. 

00:11:30
MAUREEN MOORE The language and pace changed here. The mention of being hurtful is almost dismissive and could be missed. Hurt is a strangely shameful feeling, but was shared here in a way that allowed me to witness the depth of that feeling.I was again aware that listening for what is not said, is often an excellent way of developing an awareness of the clients true feelings. Listening to you, it sounds as if you were hurt by that, living in this area. 

00:12:15
JACINTA POWELL Yeah. 

00:12:15
MAUREEN MOORE And then, perhaps as a result of that, hoped for a different experience when you moved to London? 

00:12:20
JACINTA POWELL But there's just as much racism from just does like, doesn't matter if you're black, black people be racist to people that are white or the people they think are white and I'm sure it's happen, it happens in different areas, with different, um, like communities, but I've never lived in like a Chinese area or an Indian area in London, but that sort of experience. 

00:12:45
MAUREEN MOORE (crosstalk) Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So, there was a sense of disappointment when you went to London? 

00:12:50
JACINTA POWELL Yeah, definitely. 

00:12:50
MAUREEN MOORE And found that you didn't belong there either. 

00:12:55
JACINTA POWELL Yeah. Yeah, but I suppose, dunno, I suppose being mixed race in itself makes you confused. Like if you've got two sort of cultures within you, um, you don't, you don't feel half and half, nothing like that because, but you do, that confuses you in its own right. 

00:13:20
MAUREEN MOORE The client had mentioned earlier her hoped for different experience. Now she speaks about re-experiencing racism in a setting in which she had thought she would be accepted. Her tone communicated a sense of disappointment. I noticed this and communicated this to her in attentive way, so she could correct me if I was wrong. As counselors, we do not always get it right. The effectiveness is that she reflects on the impact of the unexpected painful experience. I'm just wondering how you dealt with that confusion when you were in Somerset? 

00:14:15
JACINTA POWELL Well, I would say that I, I did mainly feel white, even though my mom's Indian, but I would say that because all my family live abroad, so I don't really, I don't really have much of a culture in that respect of an Indian culture, which I do feel I've missed out on, but that's just the way things have happened. 

00:14:40
MAUREEN MOORE (crosstalk) Mm-hmm. 

00:14:40
JACINTA POWELL So. 

00:14:40
THE NEED TO BELONG 

00:14:45
MAUREEN MOORE The client introduces the confusion that she feels in respect of her cultural experience. She moves away from the racial bombardment to a rather more safe aspect of difference. That of cultural difference. Her moments of inner reflection brought out a feeling of confusion, which can result from being challenged from two or more different directions, racial then cultural difference. I ask a question about how she dealt with the confusion in the first context. This was with the intention of encouraging the client to think about her strengths and to gain some sense of how able she was as a person. So there's something you wanted, a feeling inside. 

00:15:50
JACINTA POWELL (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:15:50
MAUREEN MOORE You said you felt white. 

00:15:50
JACINTA POWELL Yeah. 

00:15:50
MAUREEN MOORE Yeah. 

00:15:50
JACINTA POWELL Yeah. 

00:15:50
MAUREEN MOORE And this just feels really important? That what you felt. 

00:15:55
JACINTA POWELL Definitely, it's what you feel. 

00:15:55
MAUREEN MOORE (crosstalk) That's important. 

00:15:55
JACINTA POWELL But then I knew I wasn't which sort of confuses you. 

00:16:00
MAUREEN MOORE Yeah. 

00:16:00
JACINTA POWELL When you feel (inaudible ). I suppose the way you look in your feelings. I don't know they can sort of fight amongst themselves. I dunno. It's confusing. 

00:16:16
MAUREEN MOORE So, when you felt white, but your experiences outside of that seem to suggest that, suggest something different. There was a, a, kind of a conflict. 

00:16:25
JACINTA POWELL Yeah. 

00:16:25
MAUREEN MOORE And you didn't know how to um, how to blend in, how to reconcile the difference? 

00:16:35
JACINTA POWELL Yeah, uh, yeah. Um, the older I've got the more happy and comfortable I am, um, with myself. 

00:16:40
MAUREEN MOORE Uh huh. 

00:16:40
JACINTA POWELL I'm 100% happy with my background, but I suppose at that age, yeah, I'd have wished to be white in situations. 

00:16:50
MAUREEN MOORE Mmhmm. 

00:16:50
JACINTA POWELL Because, but then I suppose looking at it, at it, when I live in Peckham now, in certain situations I do wish I was black, because just, just little things like getting on the bus and people budging you and in a way I thought I was spoken to at times by other black people. I do feel that there is animosity towards me because I'm not black, but, I, I dunno at the same times those are my insecurities and my sort of what I know, but that's, that's playing into it, as well. Which, I don't. I don't know. 

00:17:25
MAUREEN MOORE She focuses on her inner feelings. This is the beginning of her switch from out there to in here in relation to herself. 

00:17:41
MAUREEN MOORE How did you come to realize that you didn't belong in Peckham either? 

00:17:50
JACINTA POWELL Mmm. I suppose It's just every day interactions sort of. Just going out shopping there. Just speaking to people in the shops and, well, I do belong there cause I've lived there for six months and it is my new home now. I dunno, I think I would like to live in a more diverse like area like, I've only lived in white areas and black areas. 

00:18:20
MAUREEN MOORE Mm-hmm. 

00:18:20
JACINTA POWELL I'd like to live, but I, you know I don't know if these areas exist where there's people where it's completely multicultural. I don't think so. I think people just group to their own. Especially in London. Just got areas of different ethnicities. 

00:18:35
MAUREEN MOORE Mmm. It's. I'm beginning to kind of feel that there was such an expectation that because Peckham was a black area or predominantly black area, that that, that you would feel suddenly very comfortable and very much at home. 

00:18:55
JACINTA POWELL Yeah. 

00:18:55
MAUREEN MOORE And, the, your focus has been predominantly on that. That hope, that expectation. 

00:19:00
JACINTA POWELL (crosstalk) Mm. Mm. 

00:19:05
MAUREEN MOORE And because that hasn't, um, materialized, that, that hasn't given you what you expected.Then there is a greater disappointment. There's a greater sense of hopelessness really, um, in relation to fitting in. 

00:19:20
JACINTA POWELL (crosstalk) Yeah, exactly. 

00:19:20
MAUREEN MOORE And that has become kind of uppermost in your mind. You know, I must fit in somewhere. 

00:19:25
JACINTA POWELL Definitely. 

00:19:25
MAUREEN MOORE Yeah 

00:19:30
JACINTA POWELL But then, you loose hope, but you kind of just think, oh that's just the way it is. 

00:19:35
MAUREEN MOORE Yeah. The challenge to both race and culture where at the core of her identity. I felt it important to gain greater understanding of the depth of this feeling to move on from what was superficial and safe. There were times there were other unexpressed feelings suggested by tone and look. The quiet silence had to be respected. When the client speaks of her intention to find new context in which to continue her search for acceptance I summarize the story to highlight her focus on the ideal context in which she hopes to find herself. Where would the next step take you in this search for belonging? 

00:20:40
JACINTA POWELL Um, I, in my mind I think it's traveling. 

00:20:45
MAUREEN MOORE (crosstalk) Traveling. 

00:20:45
JACINTA POWELL It's just sort of after I finish university, just, just travel, and I especially want to go back to India, because that's where my roots are from. I don't know anything about, I don't know anything about it, so, definitely. 

00:21:00
MAUREEN MOORE Right. So there's a, ummm, way of looking for this place in which you belong? 

00:21:10
JAY Yeah. 

00:21:10
MAUREEN MOORE Which could be some, some place, some, uh, country, town, or culture. A culture? 

00:21:15
JACINTA POWELL (crosstalk) I don't think you ever belong in one place. 

00:21:20
MAUREEN MOORE (crosstalk) Right 

00:21:20
JACINTA POWELL (crosstalk) Yeah, definitely, but, um, I suppose I just need to know that side of me. 

00:21:25
MAUREEN MOORE Uh huh. 

00:21:25
JACINTA POWELL I think, oh that's maybe it, you know? Maybe because I haven't I don't know, I don't know that side of me. I don't know my culture properly. I think maybe once I've experienced that I will be happier and doesn't really matter where I am as long as I sort of more whole. 

00:21:40
MAUREEN MOORE (crosstalk)Yes, absolutely. So, the the the, the search is for that other part of you. 

00:21:45
JACINTA POWELL Yeah. 

00:21:45
MAUREEN MOORE That, well, will become part of you. 

00:21:50
JACINTA POWELL Mmm. 

00:21:50
MAUREEN MOORE And then like feeling white, you will also feel Indian. 

00:21:55
JACINTA POWELL (crosstalk) Yeah, definitely. 

00:21:55
MAUREEN MOORE And that wholeness, , uh, will, will be with you regardless of where you are, whether you are in Peckam, or Somerset, or India, or China, or whatever. 

00:22:05
JACINTA POWELL (crosstalk) Mmm. Yeah, definitely, I think it's just gonna sort of come with experience and age and I just sort of, dunno, just mature as a person I think. 

00:22:15
MAUREEN MOORE Mmhmm. 

00:22:15
JACINTA POWELL Make me more happy. 

00:22:15
MAUREEN MOORE So, the, the meeting of, of, um, all those parts of you and accepting and understanding that they are part of you and not part of an external group of people will help you to feel that you can belong and challenge the um, the difficulties of living in one, um, place or another. 

00:22:45
JACINTA POWELL (crosstalk) Mm. Yup. Mm. Mm. 

00:22:50
MAUREEN MOORE There is an ah hah moment when she says maybe that is it and talks of finding more about something that is part of herself already and expresses that new search in terms of being more whole. I use reflection and summary and share some of what I felt to help us to create a shared meaning of her notion of wholeness. Has it helped talking about this? 

00:23:35
JACINTA POWELL Yeah, definitely. I mean, I suppose when you start talking about something you actually realize how you feel. Sometimes, it's just all in there or in there. Yeah, it's made me more in touch with how I feel. 

00:23:50
MAUREEN MOORE Yeah. What seemed to be around would be, for me, was the contrast between what you felt inside you, which seemed to be half of you. 

00:24:05
JACINTA POWELL Mmm. 

00:24:05
MAUREEN MOORE And the expectation that some external environment could provide the other half of you. 

00:24:10
JACINTA POWELL (crosstalk) Mmhmm, yeah, that's just sort of. I think that's just uh, because you don't know. How am I going to explain this? Um, Yeah, but what it comes down to is just sort of, I think happiness and not where you are just, I dunno finding out for yourself. Educating yourself, maybe. 

00:24:35
MAUREEN MOORE Mmhmm. Maybe about knowing who you are. 

00:24:40
JACINTA POWELL Yeah. 

00:24:40
MAUREEN MOORE Rather than knowing what the environment is going to offer you. 

00:24:45
JACINTA POWELL (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:24:45
MAUREEN MOORE Or expecting what the environment is going to offer. 

00:24:45
JACINTA POWELL (crosstalk) Mmhmm. 

00:24:50
MAUREEN MOORE In her own time, she reaches the conclusion that what is important to being who I am is more about the knowledge and acceptance of the self that is within her, rather than the environment in which that self resides. So we've moved from trying out different locations, to finding out more about yourself. 

00:25:20
JACINTA POWELL (crosstalk) Mmm. Exactly. 

00:25:25
MAUREEN MOORE Yeah. 

00:25:25
JACINTA POWELL Mmm. 

00:25:25
MAUREEN MOORE How does feel? 

00:25:25
JACINTA POWELL Um, just feels like I've been enlightened with knowledge. It makes me feel quite, looking back, quite stupid before thinking that a place could change the way you feel. Um, positive because it's onward. Um, it's excited, cause there's so much to look forward to and find out. Um, excited, um, excited about with my future happiness, I suppose. 

00:26:00
MAUREEN MOORE That's lovely to hear. 

00:26:00
JACINTA POWELL Mmm. 

00:26:05
MAUREEN MOORE I almost feel that when you go back to Peckham, you'll get on the bus and look at these people that have been pushing you out of the way. 

00:26:15
JACINTA POWELL Mmm. 

00:26:15
MAUREEN MOORE Almost feel you might look at them differently, because in a sense you know there is more to you than they know about. 

00:26:25
JACINTA POWELL (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah, definitely. And I don't fault them for, for that. For what, for the way they act in, in that where they live. I don't, I don't think it's a problem, it's just sort of. I dunno, it's just the way it is and like, and there's just a cultural difference there, I will never understand, so. I dunno. 

00:26:50
MAUREEN MOORE Okay, I think we'll leave it there, Jay, and if necessary, we can talk more about it another time. 

00:27:00
JACINTA POWELL (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:27:05
MAUREEN MOORE Okay. 

00:27:05
MAUREEN MOORE The client summarizes and suggests that she has had an experience, which has been enlightening, positive, respectful, and encouraging. This has been achieved, despite the fact that I did not tell her anything. It is evidence of the ability of this client to achieve her potential, given the right conditions.
