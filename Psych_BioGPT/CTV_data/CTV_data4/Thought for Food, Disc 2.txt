Thought for Food Session 2 

00:00:05
UNKNOWN It's nice to see you again Elaine. 

00:00:05
ELAINE (inaudible ) 

00:00:08
UNKNOWN And uh, just a little bit like when we met last time, just a little bit of a mood tracker as to what might be going on with you just now. 

00:00:15
ELAINE I'm pretty relaxed. 

00:00:20
UNKNOWN Right, right. And that's interesting, because the last time we met you said you were feeling quite anxious. 

00:00:25
ELAINE Hm, hm, yeah. 

00:00:25
UNKNOWN So I wonder what's changed you, to be feeling relaxed. 

00:00:30
ELAINE It's funny, I was relaxed and now that you've checked in with me it's starting to rise a little bit. So there is, there was a twitch of anxiety then, and, because we're here, and just because I know what to expect I think. 

00:00:45
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:00:45
ELAINE A lot of the anxiety last time was around, I didn't know what to expect, but I do this time. 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN Hm. Hm. 

00:00:50
ELAINE So I feel a bit more relaxed (inaudible ) 

00:00:57
UNKNOWN Hm. And I know last time that the worry was that we might go to some places that you weren't liking on going. And I think at the end you said, we were just talking about the weight. 

00:01:05
ELAINE Yes. Yeah. So I guess that ties in with why I'm a bit more relaxed. That um, I am in, more in control of that. 

00:01:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:01:15
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:01:15
UNKNOWN Right. So thinking back to our last session, um, I wonder have you got any thoughts about what we talked about? 

00:01:25
ELAINE Yeah, um, the session went pretty quick and pleasing. And I came away with thinking about weight management more, but it's been the after affects. Not so, you know the doing the homework, and what's that brought up for me that's been the biggest impact. So not just the session, more about what's been happening since. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN Right, so the homework that we talked about you doing . . . 

00:02:00
ELAINE Hm. 

00:02:00
UNKNOWN And that was just to monitor yourself and your thoughts around food. 

00:02:05
ELAINE Hm. Hm. Hm. Yeah. 

00:02:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. I think that's why it's called thought record, it was very thought provoking. 

00:02:10
ELAINE Right. 

00:02:10
UNKNOWN Hm. So that sounds like that's something we can spend a fair bit of time looking at today. Um, and um, I think there were a couple of things for me from the last session, that I might want to put on the agenda too. And one of those was around, ah, something that you said in the session, um, that, you ate and it was something around comfort eating. But also when you said you felt anxious and panicky that you would e at as well. And so, I'd, I'd be quite interested in to perhaps looking at that in the session. 

00:02:50
ELAINE Okay. 

00:02:50
UNKNOWN And there was something also about spending some time looking at activities . . . 

00:02:50
ELAINE Hm. 

00:02:50
UNKNOWN . . . because we did talk . . . 

00:02:55
ELAINE Hm. 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN . . .a bit about that last time. So that's, that's, that's what I'd want to, do look at. I wonder if there was anything else that you might want to talk about today? 

00:03:10
ELAINE Um, I'm not sure where I will go, I'm not sure if I want to talk about it or, but there were some things from the thought record and um, you know worries evoked for me. There's some things that, um, like um, eating on my own. You know I'm might even find ways of doing that. Um, and some of the thoughts that I put down, I was quite mixed, um surprised at. 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN Right. Right. Okay. 

00:03:35
ELAINE So I suppose around the homework really. 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN Right, so that looks like it might be a good place for us to start . . . 

00:03:40
ELAINE Okay. 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN . . .because it sounds like there is a fair bit of work that we can do in there. 

00:03:45
ELAINE Okay. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN First of all I mean how easy was it to do that? To do the homework? 

00:03:50
ELAINE Um, hm, I don't think it was easy. That's the first thing. I don't think it was easy. Um, it was, um, remembering, um, it was funny really, because I didn't know where to put the thought records at first. You know, I didn't know whether to keep them in the kitchen, or like in my own room for like work stuff. So I didn't know whether. . . 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN Mm-hm. 

00:04:15
ELAINE . . . to keep it in there. Um, and that's really funny when I think of that now, when I'm actually saying it now. The reason why I didn't put it, want to keep it in the kitchen is 'cause my um son can be quite cynical about things. So I didn't want him to sort of read them. So that was the first day, but I eventually kept them upstairs. Um, so it was like around the thought, I did a lot of the thought records around either preparing or actually eating. 

00:04:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:04:50
ELAINE So I'd have to remember, run up stairs as soon as, to write those immediate thoughts down. 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:04:55
ELAINE But, and, you know, if I did have to do a thought record around work time, you know, I did come home, but it was better when I wrote the thoughts down straight away. 

00:05:10
UNKNOWN Right. Yeah, I was wondering if it changed the thoughts or changed the feelings? The fact that you had to run upstairs to write them down, or do them after the event. 

00:05:20
ELAINE Yeah I'm not, I don't, I wouldn't like to say they changed. But I certainly you know, when I did when I came home from work, I'd be thinking, 'What was I thinking?' Whereas if I went upstairs straight away and wrote them down, it was like, 'This is what I'm thinking.' 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:05:30
ELAINE Hm. 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN Right. Yeah, yeah, I was just thinking it, it, it could almost be something that we could do in a session as well. So, so we'd have it really live. 

00:05:45
ELAINE Hm. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN So what did you, what did you come up with? 

00:05:50
ELAINE Do you want me to . . . 

00:05:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:05:50
ELAINE . . .(inaudible ) Okay, um, well it's a little bit sad actually it is, and it did sadden me, um all my eating was done on my own. And you know, over, over the time that we've been apart that's quite a fair bit of time to be eating on your own. So that wasn't a good thing for me to highlight, you know, it was okay the first once or twice that I put down, 'on own, on my own.' And the second, 'on my own.' But when I got to to about three or four thought records on, and it was still on my own . . . 

00:06:25
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:06:25
ELAINE . . . you know I started, 'Hm', you know I'd, 'What's that about?' You know, um, um, yeah, it, I accept being on my own, it's a great time, but I love it. It's a real good part of life, that I'm on my own, but that eating on my own wasn't so good. 

00:06:45
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:06:45
ELAINE So that was one thing, um, I don't think look, I looked, I looked over them before I came today, and I don't think I put down a lot of feeling words. So I'm not sure if that was a conscious decision or if that was because I was concentrating more on the thoughts, if I misunderstood you. Even though the thought record says feelings, but there's not an awful lot of feeling words there. If any. Um, and there's still a lot of thoughts about, um, not wanting to do it for me. So things like, a thought, 'Make sure there's enough for Liam.' 'I hope this food lasts the week.' 'Give more portions to Liam.' 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN If you were to hazard a guess, if they were the types of thoughts that you were having, what do you think you might have been feeling when you were having those types of thoughts? 

00:07:50
ELAINE Um, some anxiety I guess. Um, I think just, I think just uh, complacency, is that a mood or more of a labeling word really? But, because it's something I've always done, um, so there wouldn't be like um, just anxiety I think . . . 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:08:20
ELAINE . . .Yeah, and there's nicer thoughts you know, like a, you know um, 'they're delicious,' or 'this is healthy food.' You know, but there's a lot of negative thoughts. 

00:08:30
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:08:30
ELAINE So for me that was the being on my own whilst eating for ever meal. And, um, about, about um, having food that I can have that I can enjoy that's just for me. So that was the biggest learning really. 

00:08:55
UNKNOWN So being on your own, I'm just thinking back to the last time we met, and when you talked about the meals with your grandparents and what foods meant in that situation, I'm just wondering what you might make of those two very sort of different, sort of environments for having food? 

00:09:25
ELAINE Yeah, I suppose I can, you know, um, and going back 30-years, I hate to say that, and going back 30-odd-years, and you know society and things obviously have changed a lot. Like my nana, she had this best room, but then you had this middle room, and that's where the dining table was, it was always up more or less anyway. And you'd have the furniture around it, wouldn't you?You're like the, you know, I can't believe how much you had in one room. You know, people talk abut minimalistic, she had a piano, she hat the setty, she had the fire place, you know around this dining table, so the dining table was like center. And, um, you'd come to the table for the meal so, and I, you know, my nana never worked or things and I would be in school anyway, so it be like you would wait for my grandfather, he worked for a little while, although he was quite old. So he was coming to early retirement when I was in my teens, but it be her, him, and me at the table. It would be at the table. So she might be standing at the edge of the table, and do you remember when they used to have the bloody flat beds of bread, and she'd bring the carving knife run way, where it is, you know, sometimes. Today we do that, but um, so she'd be like at the edge of the table and then me and my grandfather would be, you know, like um, length and breadth of the table and then she'd join us obviously. Um, and I suppose even when I think about it, I think me and my kids we used to sit around the table. I always had a table. 'Cause I know people, and I've known friends who, you now, use trays and things. But I've got a dinner table. I can't, um, you know sometimes in work, um, we sit round, and I have to sit by a table. Just thinking about that now really. I think it was more about being on my own though, that you know, conversation and things, and, and. . . Do you know what, you know when I was thinking back, it was a little bit lonely really. To have, you know, because food is like, you know, we've got to have food to live. You know, so we shouldn't be frightened about food or hang-ups about food, you know. But even as that loneliness, you know, 'cause I do still sit at the table, and I set the table, but, you know, to, and I haven't acknowledged it before, but every time I was writing it down, 'Where was I?' 'At a dining table along, a dining table alone, a dining table along.' You know that was . . . 

00:12:20
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:12:20
ELAINE . . .really quite sad and lonely. 

00:12:20
UNKNOWN Hm. Because it almost sounds like sitting at the table in other times in your life it, the food was there, but it was also about that talking, and meeting together . . . 

00:12:30
ELAINE Yeah, yeah, yeah, I feel a bit emotional actually . . . 

00:12:35
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:12:35
ELAINE Because it was, yeah, you know, um, when I was like younger, my grandfather was, my nan was a fabulous cook, you know and people was when they, in them days. You know they, everything was natural and things. But when I was quite young we'd do daft things with the food, you know. Like if there was mash and gravy, you know we'd make a well, and he'd say, because he was like a site manager, and he'd say well we mixing cement now, you know what I mean? So he'd put the mash in and mix it with the gravy and things. Yeah and there was conversation around food as well. 

00:13:10
UNKNOWN Hm. Hm. I'm actually interested, did you time how long you would be eating your meals? Do you know how long you'd take. 

00:13:20
ELAINE Well, um, there might be some times, there were times on when I was eating, but did not so much about the time and how long it took me to eat it. There's definitely times on there, what time I was eating. 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN Hm. Yeah, I wonder if you could say how long you might spend having a meal when you're on your own. 

00:13:40
ELAINE Um, okay that would vary on mood. Um, you know, cause like I said it does fit with our table thing. You know I do like, you know I do like the table set, and I love nice china, um you know I like um, you know, condiments and things like that. So it depends what mood. So if I really felt like, you know, that I was, you know, 'Let's do it all lovely.' You know, like, as if you were entertaining, or, so I would do that for myself on some occasions, but then other occasions it would be just slap the plate down and, you know, um, just get on with it really. 

00:14:25
UNKNOWN A real sense of ceremony. 

00:14:30
ELAINE Sometime. Yeah. Yeah. But I think that links to the mood. That would be interesting to monitor that really. Yeah, sometimes I can really, and sort of really enjoy the moment. Like you would if perhaps you was a nine-year old, but still enjoying it. But then other times, just, the quicker the better sort of thing. 

00:14:50
UNKNOWN Hm, yeah that would be something interesting to monitor. Because of course the quicker the better, um, there's some sort of idea that um, if you eat food quickly, the brain doesn't have time to tell the stomach its had enough. And the tendency if its quickly that you've eaten something and you haven't registered it, its a meal. That you might be more prone to have something else and eat more than, or snack. 

00:15:25
ELAINE Yeah, it's good point. I think I have read something like that before. And the quicker the better is about timing as well. Um, yes, yeah, it is a lot of differences. Sometimes I will spend a bit of time, you know, thinking about, um better ways of eating, and then sometimes it will be like, 'Oh, just have a tin of soup.' You know. 

00:15:50
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:15:50
ELAINE So open the can and throw it in the dish and throw it down your throat. That last thought. . . 

00:15:55
UNKNOWN Hm. And so much a contracts. 

00:16:00
ELAINE Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:16:00
UNKNOWN Such a contrast. 

00:16:00
ELAINE There's definitely a contrast. 

00:16:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, I think that might be something to you know . . . 

00:16:05
ELAINE Yeah, I think that that's . . . 

00:16:05
UNKNOWN Just to, just to monitor. 

00:16:05
ELAINE Yeah, I think, uh I was thinking about that right now really. 

00:16:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:16:10
ELAINE A contrast. And what's going on before that contrast. 

00:16:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. And you said also some thoughts around um, your son. 

00:16:20
ELAINE Yeah, and I've I, you know I said last time you know like um, you know I try to shift constantly. You know I'm known to play the martyr, you know, the victim. And I've done a lot of work on shifting from that so I, so that was another fear of those thought records. You know it reminded me so much about the past and although the thoughts might be still there. On some level I know there and I don't ever want to go back there. So obviously in times gone by, I have given to the kids. Because I think that's what, you know I'm generalizing, but I think that's what single parents do. You know, there's a necessity to some level. But it's there now and doesn't necessarily have to be. So before you know, I can see the rationale for that, but I can't so much now, but I haven't got all the way hang of it. So there was, there's a enough, there's only two of us. So there's enough food for me and him. But, cause he would probably eat, some ranges of different foods to me. But that though I don't know how many times I said it here, but um, 'Make sure there's enough for Liam. Is this food going to last, and um, you know, um give more to Liam.' Um. 

00:17:45
UNKNOWN If there wasn't enough for Liam, or you didn't give to Liam, what might that mean or say about you? 

00:17:50
ELAINE Oh God, no, it, um, oh God, no, there would have to be enough. You know. Um, so, oh, I can't even think about it. You know, I'm, you know all the thoughts would be, 'He needs it. He's a growing boy.' Um, 'He's young.' You know, um you know, 'He plays sports.' He needs this, you know he's a, it be all those those. You know, he needs it more. 

00:18:25
UNKNOWN Than you. 

00:18:25
ELAINE Yeah, yeah. 

00:18:25
UNKNOWN And if you don't provide those needs, what does that say about you? 

00:18:30
ELAINE That I'm not a good mother. 

00:18:35
UNKNOWN Hm. That would seem as a good reason for you in the past . . . 

00:18:40
ELAINE Hm. 

00:18:40
UNKNOWN . . . for not perhaps feeding yourself in the way that was necessarily healthy for you. 

00:18:50
ELAINE Hm. Yeah like in the past I can see, you know that, that, you know, I can see the rationale it was not just food it was across the board. You know. 

00:19:05
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:19:05
ELAINE If they needed shoes they'd have shoes etc. And I, I'm sure a lot of other mothers would suggest saying the same thing, but I don't need to do that so much now. 

00:19:15
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:19:15
ELAINE So is that old pattern of behavior that I need to shift? 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:19:20
ELAINE 'Cause things have changed? 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN It's something around being a good mother. 

00:19:25
ELAINE Yeah, that's still it, you know, yeah. I, um, yeah that bites me on the bum sometimes. 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:19:35
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN But I'm also wondering that a good mother for a six year old or a eight year old, being a good mum to a child that age . . . 

00:19:45
ELAINE Hm. 

00:19:45
UNKNOWN . . .would there be some changes to being a good mum to a teenager.? Would a good mom, would things change at all? Would the child's needs change? 

00:19:55
ELAINE Yeah, the child, you know, the child's needs do change, and you know I, you know I recognize in my own two boys, you know the one's 27 and the one's 19 and we've been on our own since the youngest one was six months. So, you know, I know their needs have changed, but they need for me also, to feel, if you know what I mean? I love the saying, they make your heart ache, they make your arm ache when they're babies, and your heart ache when you're older. So for me a good mother is there for them all of the time. So yes I know their needs are different from when they're six to when they're 13 to when they're 27, but if they need me then I have to be a good mother. 

00:21:00
UNKNOWN Hm. What I'm sort of thinking is that in order to be a, a, a good mother, you need to be there and be sort of fit and strong and healthy and, and what I'm sort of wondering is that wouldn't you then have to be sort of looking after yourself in order to be doing that? 

00:21:20
ELAINE Yeah, that's a good point. Yes, it's something like I'm getting older too, and I need to look after me. 

00:21:30
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:21:30
ELAINE Yeah, it's a good point. 

00:21:35
UNKNOWN Well yes, because I'm sort of thinking the stronger and healthier and fitter you are the longer. . . 

00:21:40
ELAINE Hm. 

00:21:40
UNKNOWN . . .you're going to. . . 

00:21:40
ELAINE Hm. 

00:21:40
UNKNOWN . . .be able to be . . . 

00:21:40
ELAINE Hm. 

00:21:40
UNKNOWN . . .that person. 

00:21:45
ELAINE Yes, yes, no so it be a good point. 

00:21:50
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:21:50
ELAINE Yeah, and I know those things, you know, and I've read about those things obviously. At certain ages women have to become, in a sense, more healthier than they do when they're younger. 

00:22:05
UNKNOWN I wonder what it would take for you to move it from knowing to, to, to actually. 

00:22:15
ELAINE I think, you know I think, I do think I'm getting a little bit better. Um, it would take a big shift, I'm, supposing, I don't know. Let's think about this. Supposing me and Liam liked jaffas and there was only one there, and he said he wanted it. I still know right now that I'd say, 'Well have it love.' You know, 'You, you, you need it more.' 

00:22:50
UNKNOWN Hm. How does that feel for you when you say that? What do you get from that? 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:10
ELAINE Uh, I, I don't know what I get from it. It's, it's like the norm, it's that's, that's how it should be. That's, that's how we always have been and you know, you provide for your kids. You give to your kids. Oh God, I just know where I just came from. You give to your kids. That's my mother's saying. All of the time. She said it last week. Because now she's shifted um, to the grandchildren so we so we fessed as adults. The focus has gone of us is the adults now, and if anything happens to the grandchildren, and they range from seven to 28, and that you make sure you're doing a great job by them kids. And, you know, don't forget they come first. She said it to me last week about something. 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN So there's a rule that's . . . 

00:24:15
ELAINE Hm. 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN . . .been handed down. 

00:24:20
ELAINE Hm. Hm. 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN So I wonder what would happen if you broke that rule? 

00:24:25
ELAINE Hm. It's a bit scary if you think about it, let alone do it. It is. 

00:24:35
[sil.] 

00:24:40
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:24:40
ELAINE It would need a bit work work. Bit more experimenting or something, you know, but that putting your kids first is pretty um . . . 

00:24:55
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:24:55
ELAINE . . .yeah even sitting here now I could, I don't need to reel them off, but I can think of about three times in this last week where I've chosen the kids over me. Even down to money. 

00:25:05
UNKNOWN Hm. Yeah. And you said that . . . 

00:25:10
ELAINE Actually, vastly . . . 

00:25:10
UNKNOWN . . .that the feeling would be too horrible to think that if you didn't do that . . . 

00:25:20
ELAINE Hm. Quite scary to think about . . . 

00:25:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:25:20
ELAINE . . .isn't it. 

00:25:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. So in some ways doing it keeps that horrible feeling away. 

00:25:30
ELAINE Hm. Yeah, yeah. 

00:25:30
UNKNOWN Hm. But of course your Liam doesn't have the opportunity to do that back for you. 

00:25:40
ELAINE Hm. 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN Or experience what it might feel like. . . 

00:25:45
ELAINE Hm. 

00:25:45
UNKNOWN To put you . . . 

00:25:45
ELAINE Yeah, that is a good point. Because I'm just thinking now, oh, I love him to bits. He is a bit of a taker, but I built that process. You know, where he is at the minute, he would expect that offer to be his. And I can see that I've been part of that process. Well it's a funny old game, isn't it? 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:26:20
ELAINE It is. 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, it, you look really sort of . . . 

00:26:20
ELAINE I am making a lot of links. A lot of links. 

00:26:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:26:25
ELAINE And that's exactly what those thoughts, although some of it was a little bit sad, and a little bit, but it did make me think links. A lot of links came up from, from the past, and you know patterns. 

00:26:45
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:26:45
ELAINE And that's, that is, I'm quite pensive now, because a lot of things that are happening right now in this moment . . . 

00:26:50
UNKNOWN I wonder if you'd be able to share any of them. 

00:26:55
ELAINE Some, some, some I could. You know, um, that rule, you know that rule has definitely been handed down from my mother, and you know, look after the kids, the kids always come first. 

00:27:15
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:27:15
ELAINE Put the kids first. Do right by them kids. 

00:27:20
UNKNOWN What do you think the benefit in having that rule, it has been for you? 

00:27:25
ELAINE Um, well it is benefit, you know, you um, do right by your kids. Whatever. You know you, you, you, um, you know you provide for them. I'm thinking about little kids. You know you, you, um keep a roof over their heads. They're clean, they're tidy, they, you know they are um, I'm talking about that rule is practical stuff. Um. 

00:28:00
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:28:00
ELAINE So you become, you become a good enough mother on a practical mother, you know um . . . 

00:28:10
UNKNOWN So it's something about how you see yourself. When you do that on a practical level. 

00:28:20
ELAINE Yeah, yeah, I can, yeah, can see myself, um, you know, um, providing for my children. Their needs. Um, you know warm beds, clean clothes, you know. 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN Almost like a tick box. 

00:28:40
ELAINE Hm. 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN I've done this, I've done this, I've done this. 

00:28:45
ELAINE Yeah, yeah, yes. 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN I'm a good enough mom. 

00:28:45
ELAINE Yes. Nice polished shoes for school. White shirts. 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:28:45
ELAINE You know. Clean shirt everyday. Nice, crisp, ironed. You know, and. . . 

00:29:00
[sil.] 

00:29:00
ELAINE Yes there's some benefits, you know, there's that sense of um, well I'm doing a good enough job as a role of a mother. 

00:29:15
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:29:20
ELAINE And. . . 

00:29:20
UNKNOWN I wonder if it would also say something about how other people might be seeing you in the role as a mother as well. 

00:29:30
ELAINE Hm. Um, my two boys say I've done a good enough job. You know, they, I have, you know, they're very open, the youngest one is a little bit different. My oldest boy is like, can express anything that he wants to express. And he'll, you know, tell me a lot of the time, you know, how supportive I am, you know, and a good mother. And other people? Huh? Um? My mother wouldn't say that I'm a good mother. Even though she gives me the rules to live by. She does, she says the opposite to me. You know that, that I could do better. You know um, because that's why she gives me the rules, you know to instruct me at what I can do better. And some, some meets who have known me and the boys, um, you know they have probably given me compliments, um, because obviously they've known, um that Liam was only six months when his father walked out. So some people know me and have said you've done a good job. And, but I also think I've tried to do a good job on the emotional side as well. Not just the practical side, but it's the practical side that I think I measure things on. 

00:31:10
UNKNOWN That's interesting. . . 

00:31:10
ELAINE And that's what I'm thinking about now. 

00:31:10
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:31:10
ELAINE Because the practical stuff would be like, oh go on, give them a jaffle and tick the tick box. But I forget that I, you know I forget that I give them equal amount of emotional stuff. That I tell them how much I love them, and touch them. Even though, you know, I jump on my 27-year old's lap to touch him now. But I still make him do it. Well, he's, he's, he's quite open to that, but of a laugh like. But um . . . 

00:31:45
UNKNOWN Hm. So there's that being a good mother with all the sort of the practical things, but also being a good mom with the love that you give them. 

00:32:00
ELAINE Yes, but thinking about it, thinking about it now, I measure it by the practical stuff. 

00:32:05
UNKNOWN Hm. And yet if I was to ask you, what would make a good mother for you, if you were having a wish list of a good mom for you, what . . . 

00:32:20
ELAINE Hm. 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN . . .I wonder what the measure would be fore you. 

00:32:25
ELAINE I know what it'd be, I know what it'd be, because I know that, um, I have, I have a fabulous mother, but I haven't got an emotional mother. And that's sometimes the bits that I truly miss. 

00:32:45
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:32:45
ELAINE You know, just to even hear those words, 'How are you Elaine?' or 'How are you today love?' or, you know, that's what, yeah. And I know that I say that to my kids. I know that I ring them up and say, 'What sort of day you having then?' 

00:33:05
UNKNOWN Hm. And yet you were talking about your mom, if there's a problem have a leg of lamb. So there's lots of the food. But what it sounds like is that, actually you'd, you'd do away with that if you could have more of the other. 

00:33:25
ELAINE Yes. I would. That's, hm. Yeah, I would. 

00:33:30
UNKNOWN Hm. Hm. I wonder if you see if there's any link with this and you feeding yourself. I wonder. Is there? 

00:33:45
ELAINE I don't know, I might have to have, I don't know if I'm blocking that or you know, I, I can see there's a lot of stuff around food. You know, a lot. And you know, um, and I've always know it, you know, but this is really teasing it out for me. I know so sure that I'm seeing some definite links here. Or if I didn't even know that I want to yet, but I can see you know, might take a while for it to sink in really. 

00:34:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, I sort of wondered how we got here. 

00:34:25
ELAINE Yeah. Me too really. Yeah. Um, I mean if I look back at how we got here, and you know conversation around foods, and I suppose talking about Liam really, talking about giving, giving to him . . . 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:34:55
ELAINE . . .and whatever that means. And . . . 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, because uh, it, it, it was as if when you were eating, thinking about Liam, it was almost as if your mom's. . . 

00:35:10
ELAINE Hm. 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN . . . rule was there, 'Give to the children.' And yet you're saying that your way of relating to your sons, and actually food, yeah you do it, but actually you do much more than that. 

00:35:25
ELAINE Yeah, because if I, if we just took food out, I shared with you last time, you know I am a terrible cook. You know, I am. And they, they do take the mick out of me, and you know and even when they were, when they were, when I was, when they were really young, when their father was with us that was a different time. And things happened around food then, which I don't need to talk about, but that was. . . 

00:35:55
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:35:55
ELAINE That was um very damaging, and very disturbing, but um, when I was on my own with them then, well Boey would have been about nine, or nine and a half, about nine, and then the baby Liam was six months when his father left, you know from that ages on you know there's only me. And I don't know, the cooking stopped, and I know that the cooking stopped because of what happened around food before. And . . . 

00:36:35
UNKNOWN But the love didn't stop. 

00:36:35
ELAINE . . .the love didn't stop. But as I, the food, oh my, I have a chronic (inaudible ). 

00:36:41
UNKNOWN So if you were using your mom's tick box. . . 

00:36:45
ELAINE Hm. 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN You know, if you if, you know if you ask Boey and Liam to tick box, you know, the . . . 

00:36:50
ELAINE Oh, the foods wouldn't be there at all. It wouldn't. 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN And yet you say they know you love them. 

00:36:55
ELAINE Yeah, yeah. Because they don't, they definitely don't judge my love on food. 

00:37:00
UNKNOWN So for him, Liam in particular because he's still at home for you, it may not, you know, he may not have it quite so central. 

00:37:10
ELAINE Yes. 

00:37:10
UNKNOWN He may not even notice. 

00:37:15
ELAINE Yeah, that is a good point, in eh, um. . . Well that's a real good point 'cause like last weekend, he went out on Friday and he didn't come back until the Monday. At least I knew this time where he was. Um, so where did he eat them. You know. It was probably kabobs, and you know, Chinese take away with his mates and things. You know, but he even last weekend, you know I, I knew that there was like um cranberry juice, and I was thinking I won't have a glass of that, 'cause he might want that. And he wasn't even there. That is crazy isn't it, you know, when you tease that out. It's crazy. 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:37:50
ELAINE I think it follows on a little bit though, you know um, it's all still linked that I haven't done this shift, but it still links on to, 'Well what if I can't afford to get another cranberry juice and I've drunk his?' You know it's that sort of stuff. 

00:38:05
UNKNOWN Well, well, what would happen? 

00:38:15
ELAINE Um, again it's back, like if he asked for it, 'Mom, where's the cranberry, it's all gone, I can't get another one?' It would be, 'Oh, am I doing a good enough job as a mother?' 

00:38:30
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:38:30
ELAINE But you know I'm starting to think about that from now mind. 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN What do you anticipate Liam's reaction would be if . . . 

00:38:45
ELAINE Well rejection, yeah, yeah. 

00:38:50
UNKNOWN . . .if, if you didn't have any cranberry juice. 

00:38:50
ELAINE Well, he'd just, 'Oh God!' You know, he wouldn't, he would just, 'Well get some more,' you know or something like that. Uh, but um, yeah, um perhaps I wouldn't, but perhaps I would have thought, 'Well I haven't done my job, have I?' There's no cranberry here. 

00:39:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:39:15
ELAINE Well, um, that's a bit of guilt really I suppose. 

00:39:15
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:39:15
ELAINE That's what I'm trying to say. But I'm think-, we're talking about that now I'm challenging it in the moment really, 'cause he wouldn't, actually take that, because there was orange juice and apple juice, and there's water in the tap. 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN My goodness yeah. 

00:39:35
ELAINE You know, and there's tea and coffee, you know so, challenge and buy you now, that's ridiculous really. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:39:40
ELAINE But it's in that moment, I guess. 

00:39:45
UNKNOWN It's almost like there's sort of the, the, the, the meeting of two beliefs, the one that in order to be a good mom, a good enough mom, I have to provide for them. 

00:40:00
ELAINE So the practical needs. 

00:40:00
UNKNOWN Practical needs. 

00:40:00
ELAINE Yes. 

00:40:00
UNKNOWN But there's also that belief that, that, to be a good mom I need to show I love them. 

00:40:10
ELAINE Yeah, and I do believe, but it's just not as strong. I mean, I am emotionally I've been there, and I've been there emotionally and I always will. And I would like to loose that practical stuff. 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN Hm. How do you think we could work with that? To? 

00:40:35
ELAINE Ah, just related around food, or you know. . . 

00:40:35
UNKNOWN Well I think that food's our topic, isn't it. 

00:40:40
ELAINE Yeah, I was thinking that. Yeah. 

00:40:40
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:40:40
ELAINE Um, I was thinking like behavioral experiments, you know . . . 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:40:45
ELAINE . . . like you know, eating all of his favorite foods, like you know. Then there is foods that we don't like. Because I'm trying to obviously, eat the healthy um, healthy too. 'Cause that was one nice thing about this as well, because I did, because I have bought foods, because I am trying to change things. You know, I bought foods that, like um, that um, I know that I like in the shop in order that, that you know he'll get to like, you know he can share mine. That, that, I know I only like them. You know, like bags of fruit and that sort of thing, and that, and . . . 

00:41:30
UNKNOWN Hm. So you mentioned a behavior experiment, perhaps eat something that he might like. 

00:41:40
ELAINE But it'd have to be a pretty set up experiment that I know he'd want it, you know like, um, like the, like the same thing I've said, you know if I buy um, like bananas, he likes bananas, he has one every single day. And so if there was one banana left, to have that banana, you know. 

00:42:00
UNKNOWN That sounds like a really good experiment. I mean I don't know, would you be up for that? 

00:42:10
ELAINE Yeah I'd have a go. Yeah, yeah. 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN Do you think we need to sort of record this. 

00:42:15
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:42:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. I don't know if you want to perhaps write that one down. 

00:42:20
ELAINE So, what should I put here, um, 'Eat Liam's banana?' 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:42:30
ELAINE Well, I'll probably read, you know it has to be the last one. 

00:42:35
UNKNOWN The last one, yeah. 

00:42:40
ELAINE Because um, 'cause if they're in the bowl they're not all Liam's, but it's the last one that that has the effect. 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, and what do you predict? 'Cause I think we need to have some sort of predictions, you know. What do you predict you're going to feel? 

00:42:55
ELAINE Feel. Um, as I'm eating it or if he approaches me about it. 

00:43:10
UNKNOWN The whole, well, we'll perhaps predict both of them. Yeah. 

00:43:15
ELAINE Uh, I think I might be a bit scared or nervous when I'm eating it. And the thought might be, I wonder what he's going to say. 

00:43:30
UNKNOWN So that sounds like you're predicting he's going to say something. 

00:43:35
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:43:35
UNKNOWN What do you predict? What do you think he is going to say? 

00:43:35
ELAINE Uh. 

00:43:40
UNKNOWN Or do? 

00:43:40
ELAINE 'Oh you ate the last banana. That was my banana. I was looking forward to that banana. I was going to have that for my breakfast.' 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN Right, so if you were going to sum that up as to how Liam is going to react, what would you say that was? 

00:43:55
ELAINE Annoyed or frustrated with me. 

00:44:00
UNKNOWN Okay. Okay. Do you think we need to put anything else down, sort of before the experiment. 

00:44:20
ELAINE I'm not sure. I don't think so. 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN What do you think it's going to help us discover? 

00:44:30
ELAINE Um, it's going to be quite challenging to do, when I'm seeing that very last banana. That alone and in itself, you know to uh, to rise to the challenge, and then I'm open. My biggest hope is to think that, uh, that he's so busy with life that he won't even notice that I've ate the banana. He'll just wait until the next lot is bought. Because I'm sure he don't really care about it. No 19-year old don't really care about when the shopping is done and when it's not. I would like to lose that nervousness or scared about what he'd say. But now we're talking, and that's also linked to, and that's the stuff I said . . . 

00:45:20
UNKNOWN Mm-hm. 

00:45:20
ELAINE The disastrous time before his father left, around food. Yeah. So I'm hoping over all that, that I'm going to learn stuff about me, and learn that Liam is nothing like his father. 

00:45:45
UNKNOWN Right. I don't know if you need to note that down or if that's something . . . 

00:45:50
ELAINE No. Yeah, I wouldn't put that down on paper. 

00:45:50
UNKNOWN . . .or is that something you'll just be able to . . . 

00:45:50
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:45:50
UNKNOWN Elaine, just watching the time sort of here, and we are, I wonder if it's okay just to leave that little bit for the time. . . 

00:46:00
ELAINE Yeah, yeah, yeah, that sounds really good. 

00:46:00
UNKNOWN I know I said on the agenda we were going to look at sort of the uh, um, I'd like to have looked at sort of what it meant to comfort eat with regards to comfort eating and panicking. But I'm almost wanting to say can we . . . 

00:46:15
ELAINE Hm. 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN . . .bypass that. 

00:46:20
ELAINE Hm? 

00:46:20
UNKNOWN . . .and look at the other thing on the . . . 

00:46:20
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:46:20
UNKNOWN agenda that I talked about as sort of activities. 

00:46:25
ELAINE Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah. 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN Um, mm, and if you remember we sort of talked about things that you might do to sort of up your activity levels . 

00:46:35
ELAINE Yeah. Yeah. It, in, isn't it amazing like in my mind there's always lots of, 'Well you could do this, you could do that.' There has been no activity. Well, you know, I mean of course there's activity. You know, I mean if I get up and walk to the telephone in my office there's activity. But there's been no designated activity, and I though there might have been to be honest, but there doesn't. So that's something about time. Getting a slot, and then, you know, I'm quite up for getting up and walking. But first of all I've got to get a slot of time. 

00:47:25
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:47:25
ELAINE But it has to be a slot that's regular, to start first of all. So even if it was this walk around the block, I need to get the slot, so that I actually do it. 

00:47:35
UNKNOWN I wonder if you need something to help you make that slot, that time. Would there be? 

00:47:40
ELAINE Because what has worked is the slot of climbing the stairs in work and so I, you know most of the time, I'd probably say I am up to 75%, you know that I stick to that slot. So that slot has worked. So I know that I need to sit down and you know like I work out the week. 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN Almost like do a time table. 

00:48:10
ELAINE Yeah, you know, yes. May where, where can I find this slot . . . 

00:48:15
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:48:15
ELAINE . . . to do it? Repetitively. Repetitively. 

00:48:15
UNKNOWN Would that be something that you might think about doing between now and when we next meet? Just keeping it all up. . . 

00:48:25
ELAINE Yeah, I need to write that down now, because . . . 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:48:25
ELAINE Yeah, I need to remind myself about that so it's like a timetable really. But finding a slot. A regular slot. Oh, I can't even spell today. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN So there's a couple of things now for you to be doing between now and when we next meet. We're almost at the end of our, our time today . . . 

00:48:50
ELAINE Hm. 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN . . .and I just wanted to make sure that we have enough time to reflect on what you might be taking away. 

00:48:55
ELAINE Hm. 

00:48:55
UNKNOWN What was helpful, what was less helpful, and how you see these sessions going. 

00:49:05
ELAINE Yeah, um, really helpful. Really helpful to um make me make links. I wouldn't be able to do that on my own. Because I'm not quite getting it. Well, you know I am, but I need your assistance. That's really helpful. Um, you know just to sort of narrow it down really to messages and sort of patterns. So like, knowing that they're unnecessary. And I will take that away from today, and start looking at that. 

00:49:50
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:49:50
ELAINE And here and it, and its um, its right that we didn't, we didn't look today at the comfort and panic, because in my thought records they were, it were, it didn't seem to be a theme, comfort and panic, even though I might . . . 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:50:15
ELAINE . . . have thought that last time, it didn't come up in the thought records. So it seems right that we didn't meet that. It wasn't always comfortable to, you know, to talk about my mother. It wasn't that comfortable. And it was quite sad to talk about my grandparents. Because I loved them dearly you know. 

00:50:30
UNKNOWN Hm. 

00:50:30
ELAINE But it is a good session. 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN Hm. So we started by me asking you, um, just to sort of give you an idea, an indication the mood that you were, were in, and I suppose that's where we should finish really. And if you could put a name to what you might be feeling just now? 

00:50:55
ELAINE Um, still relaxed. Um, but, uh, what word would you use to, reflective. 

00:51:05
UNKNOWN Hm. You actually look reflective. 

00:51:10
ELAINE Hm, hm, hm. 

00:51:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:51:10
ELAINE Okay, thanks Elaine. 

00:51:10
UNKNOWN Thank you, thank you.
