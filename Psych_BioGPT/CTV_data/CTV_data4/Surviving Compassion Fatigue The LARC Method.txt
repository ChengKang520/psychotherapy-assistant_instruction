Surviving Compassion Fatigue The LARC Method 

00:00:05
IVY I just don't think I can do this anymore. I'm sick, I'm tired, I don't feel like I'm helping anyone. Maybe I'm just not cut off to the sky work. 

00:00:15
BRIANNA That is none sense. You are a caring, compassion and incompetent social worker. You're just what the consumer needs. 

00:00:25
IVY Maybe that's the problem. I, I think I care too much. 

00:00:35
[sil.] 

00:00:40
UNKNOWN Ivy(ph). Are you okay? 

00:00:45
IVY I'm fine, I'm fine. 

00:00:45
UNKNOWN You wanna talk about it? 

00:00:50
IVY It's the tornado. So many people are suffering and no matter what I do, it's not enough. And people have lost everything, their homes, their loved once. 

00:01:05
UNKNOWN I know, Ivy(ph), I know. But, Ivy(ph) try not to think about it too much you, you might lose yourself. 

00:01:15
IVY It's just too hard, Bri I'm not strong enough. I need a happier less stressful job like ice cream tester or kitten wrangler. 

00:01:25
BRIANNA Wha-- what? You are good at your job. We need people like you. You should be proud of the work you do. You make a real difference in people's lives. I don't think an ice cream tester can claim that type of satisfaction. 

00:01:40
IVY Well that's why I went into the field in the first place to make it difference. I didn't want other people to suffer the way I did growing up. 

00:01:45
UNKNOWN That's all right, Rick leave. That's what you always do. 

00:01:50
RICK Threw you out and I should have done this years ago especially before she came along. 

00:02:00
UNKNOWN Don't forget your coat. Jerk. 

00:02:05
IVY Anyway, I was wrong. I can't help anyone, even if I do manage to help one family there's still a million more out there who were suffering. There always will be, it's pointless. 

00:02:15
BRIANNA It would be pointless without people like you, people who care. 

00:02:20
IVY I just feel so powerless. Just to do anything I have to get the approval of like ten different people. I don't even know who my bosses are. I just-- I keep getting push from person to person and nothing ever happens. It's so frustrating. 

00:02:40
IVY I really think that Cindy(ph) needs to be remove from her home and place in foster care. 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN Oh, jeez, here we go again. You're sure Ivy? 

00:02:50
IVY Yeah. Cindy's(ph) dad has taken off and I think her mom is using again. 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN You know that you're going to have to get a court order? 

00:02:55
IVY Yeah. I know. We'll just use the same procedure we do with Rebecca(ph) last month. 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN I don't wanna have to hold your hand to this one but you do what you think what you have to. 

00:03:05
IVY Thanks. I will. 

00:03:10
UNKNOWN And don't forget about getting the background check on the foster parents. 

00:03:15
IVY Yeah. I know. 

00:03:15
UNKNOWN And you might be called the court to testify. 

00:03:20
IVY I know. 

00:03:20
BRIANNA Tell me about it. I don't know when I actually got to make a decision on my own. I feel like I'm fighting against the system. 

00:03:30
IVY I know right? And what's worse is that warily know what I'm suppose to be doing. Everyone expect something different so I end up working all night long. And you know we don't get paid overtime. 

00:03:40
BRIANNA I'm sure your hard work will payoff someday. 

00:03:45
IVY Right. Right. I have another raise in four years. The states cutting our budget left and right and look at Toby and Gabe(ph) they've been here forever. I don't think we'll ever have a chance for advancement here. 

00:04:00
BRIANNA At least we have jobs. 

00:04:00
IVY But at the price of my sanity, my health, my marriage. 

00:04:05
BRIANNA Your health? Are you sick? 

00:04:10
IVY I feel sick. All of the stress has put a serious strain on me. I, I'm exhausted but I can't sleep at night. I have no appetite and lately mot of calories seemed to be coming from line. 

00:04:25
BRIANNA Oh, honey that's no good. And your marriage, are you and Tony fighting? 

00:04:30
IVY All the time. I'm so irritable. I, I snap at the littlest things and I seem so sensitive lately. I, I just cry constantly for no reason. He tries to make me feel better but it just-- it makes me feel worse. 

00:04:50
TONY I'm thinking about going in gym day after work. You wanna come? 

00:04:55
IVY No. I'm too tired an aching. I fe-- I'll stick on my rest. 

00:05:00
TONY You sure? Sometimes exercise help you feel better. 

00:05:05
IVY What is your deal? I said no. Why do you want me to go so bad anyway? You think I'm getting out on shape? You think I'm getting fat? I can't deal with this today. 

00:05:15
TONY What's your deal? I thought just maybe you'd like to go out for little bit. 

00:05:25
BRIANNA Ivy, I'm really worried about you. Maybe you should just take a break, get away for a while. 

00:05:30
IVY Who's gonna take over my case while I'm gone? Whose gonna do my work? No. I just-- I really need to quit. 

00:05:45

Compassion Fatigue Reduce Efficiency High Turnover Rate 

00:05:55
UNKNOWN Most workers in care giving fields can probably relate to Ivy's situation. Compassion fatigue is a serious problem that may affect workers in all levels of rank and experience. Some of the effects that it can have on an individual were illustrated on video we just watched. What the video didn't show were the effects of compassion fatigue can have on the performance of an organization. Compassion Fatigue and workers can lead to reduce efficiency and a high turnover rate within the institution. This training program will help you to understand the causes and warning signs of compassionate fatigue and the best way to prevent and treat it. 

00:06:30
Compassion Fatigue Not everyone is equally susceptible to Compassion Fatigue. 

00:06:30
UNKNOWN Not everyone is equally susceptible to compassion fatigue. Certain factors may predispose in individual to the condition unfortunately, one of the main factors is the very one that you and nearly all of your co-worker share. Simply by working in a care giving field you're more likely to suffer from compassion fatigue. This is due not only to the stressful nature of the job but also because those who were drawn to this type of work tend to have a more sensitive empathetic nature. Like Ivy, care giver seek out this type of work because they want to make a difference, they want to help. Another factor that may predict the development of compassion fatigue is the previous exposure to traumatic events. For those who have suffer their own trauma hearing about another's trauma may trigger flashbacks and other PTSD like symptoms. For example, we learned that Ivy's child at home was filled with unrest, when she encounter similar situations in her job she may regress to having those same feeling she had as a child. Some of the other conditions that can lead to compassion fatigue have less do with personal disposition and more to do with the organizational structure of the workplace. 

00:07:35
Compassion Fatigue Long Hours Little Recognition No Room for Advancement Unrealistic Job Expectations Lack of Support or Resources 

00:07:40
UNKNOWN Long hours, little recognition no room for advancement, unclear unrealistic job expectations and a lack of support and resources can all combine to create a type of atmosphere or compassion fatigue can grow and spread. And when it does workers are affected on many levels. Compassion fatigue impacts both mental health and physical health. 

00:08:00

00:08:00
UNKNOWN This chronic stress can lead to high rates of illness, disturb sleep patterns, changes in appetite and even drug and alcohol abuse. Sick workers mean more sick days and less efficient work. Fortunately, there are ways to combat compassion fatigue in a workplace. One of the best ways is through the following method. 

00:08:20
Compassion Fatigue L A R C Learn Assess Renew Commit 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN LARC, learn, assess, renew, commit. Learn, the first step is to learn the dangerous and warning signs of compassion fatigue. This video is an excellent starting point. Our slight presentation will provide with even more information. Assess, after you've learned all that you can it maybe helpful to assess whether or not you're experiencing compassion fatigue into what degree. This program provides a formal measure as well as two separate worksheets to help you determine your level of compassion fatigue. Renew, don't resign yourself to having live with compassion fatigue. The resources in this program will help you to find new ways to rediscover that previous joy you had in your work. Commit, just completing a few worksheets won't make compassion fatigue disappear. It requires lots of hardwork and plenty of communication with your co-workers. Commit to taking care of yourself so that you could do your best to take of others.

BRIANNA Oh, Ivy. You look fantastic. 

00:09:35
IVY Thank you. I feel much better and I'm a little embarrass though, the last time we met I was such a wreck. 

00:09:40
BRIANNA Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I completely understand what you were going through. 

00:09:45
IVY You know what's funny? You say that. 

00:09:45
BRIANNA Why? 

00:09:45
IVY Well, I thought I was alone in my misery but when I started talking to everyone like Jeff(ph), Linda(ph), Rich(ph) and Becca(ph) it turns out they could relate to exactly how it was feeling. 

00:10:00
BRIANNA So what happened? 

00:10:00
IVY Well, we talk to our HR Rep. Nina(ph) and she had been considering this new program to help deal with compassion fatigue. 

00:10:10
BRIANNA Oh, they actually have a name for what you were going through. 

00:10:10
IVY Yeah, not only that but it's really common. So there's new program that Nina(ph) put into place is great. We got to learn about compassion fatigue. Uhm, we got assess how it's affecting us and then we got a whole new set of resources to help us renew our sense of purpose. So now we're really committed to taking care of ourselves and each other.
