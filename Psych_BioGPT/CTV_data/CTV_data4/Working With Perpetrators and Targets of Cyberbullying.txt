00:00:00
SHERI BAUMAN Well good morning and thank you for coming out so early on the last morning of the conference. I hope some of you had at least a nap in between last evening's events and this morning. I'm Sheri Bauman, I'm at the University of Arizona and I direct the counseling and mental health program. My research agenda and my writing is largely about bullying, particularly cyberbullying this is Tyler Williams who is a graduate student about to graduate so if you're looking for a hot prospect for your, in your counseling program and he works on our research grant so we are going to do a live demonstration. I will be counseling regarding, and what we're gonna do, our plan anyway is that we'll first do a scenario in which he has been targeted and then we'll stop and discuss that with you and then we'll switch and he'll be someone who's perpetrated an incident of cyber bullying. So we've talked a little but this is not scripted, I'm not sure what's gonna happen, are you? And we'll try to demonstrate what would be an approach. I also was telling Tyler just a few minutes ago that in an effort to research my anxiety about this I was searching everywhere for what the best practices for counseling individuals who are involved in cyber bullying and frankly, other than my book I could not find anything other than, you know, be alert if your child is suddenly not wanting to do this or that but in terms of, now the person is sitting with you, what do you do. I really didn't find anything so this is very much my approach as applied to this situation. I'd like to ask, I'm gonna, we are gonna try to focus on each other and tune you out as much as possible and then, so if you want to make notes, we'll stop and have a chance for you to ask questions. So, Tyler, nice to see you. 

00:02:30
TYLER WILLIAMS It's good to see you. 

00:02:30
SHERI BAUMAN What brings you here today? 

00:02:30
TYLER WILLIAMS Well, I've been having some trouble, you know, TAing for that biology class and.. 

00:02:40
SHERI BAUMAN How's that going? 

00:02:45
TYLER WILLIAMS It's going fairly well, I enjoy it, I enjoy most of the students but have you seen the confessions pages that they have on Facebook? 

00:02:55
SHERI BAUMAN Yes. 

00:02:55
TYLER WILLIAMS Okay, so, yeah, I've been having a little bit of trouble with one of those. 

00:03:00
SHERI BAUMAN Can you tell me more about that? What's going on? 

00:03:05
TYLER WILLIAMS I forget when it was, it was probably a few days ago, somebody posted about a TA for Bio150 which is the class that I'm the TA for and one of the only TAs for and they said that they had had sex with one of the TAs for that class and it was a little graphic and I'm pretty sure they were trying to write about me even though it didn't happen, it just, there were indicators in what they were writing that, I'm the only male TA for it and so there were pretty strong indicators that, yeah, it was probably about me and it's not true and I'm pretty much freaking out about it. 

00:03:55
Sheri Bauman 

00:03:55
SHERI BAUMAN Well, I would be too, I think and so the person who posts this, is anonymous, right, am I correct that you don't know who it is and they're theoretically not naming anyone but by saying the tall, thin, male TA for Bio150 is pretty targeted. 

00:04:15
Tyler Williams 

00:04:15
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, I would think that it's, it's gotta be, it has to be me and, like I said, what was said wasn't true and I'm pretty sure, I mean, I'm pretty sure I know who would have done it. 

00:04:30
SHERI BAUMAN So, let's sort of take this step by step, first of all, how are you feeling? You said freaked out but can you tell me a little more specifically what that means to you? 

00:04:40
TYLER WILLIAMS So right now my, I think my biggest concerns are, like my girlfriend will be mad 'cuz if she sees that, you know, it's obviously, once again, it's obvious that it's probably about me and also they have pretty strict rules as for graduate students and TAs about interactions with undergrads and even though it doesn't name me, I don't know whether one of the professors will see it in the department and might decide, oh, yeah, that's, and then, so I don't want to get in trouble and maybe lost my assistance-ship or, I don't know, even worse, I don't know what else could happen. 

00:05:25
SHERI BAUMAN So it sounds like a big feeling is scared. 

00:05:25
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, yeah, definitely, yeah, just really scared about all of the possibilities of the bad things that could happen 'cuz this is really important to me. 

00:05:35
SHERI BAUMAN And when you talk about that scared, you mentioned your girlfriend is one that she would see this and think, oh, what have you been up to. 

00:05:45
TYLER WILLIAMS Right, right. 

00:05:45
SHERI BAUMAN Is that realistic? How, how well does she know you would you say? 

00:05:50
TYLER WILLIAMS She knows me really well, I mean, we've been together for awhile and, but I think that, I mean, you know, I just don't know how she would react to that 'cuz I know that if I had the same thing where I saw it and it was clearly her I would, you know, I would be very upset and angry and I worry about her being, having the same reaction or going even further. 

00:06:25
SHERI BAUMAN So it sounds like you're assuming when she sees that that she'll believe it? 

00:06:25
TYLER WILLIAMS I don't, I don't know whether she'll really believe it but what makes me nervous is, well I'm scared that she will but I think what's more likely is that, I don't know, it might put like doubts in her head, I don't really... 

00:06:40
SHERI BAUMAN So, what kind of a guy are you in terms of this relationship? What, have you been honest, have you been faithful, have you been a loyal partner? 

00:06:55
TYLER WILLIAMS I think I've been, you know, a very good boyfriend and I work really hard to foster a really good relationship and do everything I possibly can to really help her out and always make her know that I'm there and, yeah I've been faithful and there haven't been any problems with that. 

00:07:15
SHERI BAUMAN So this, first of all, you have a good history with her, secondly, who's the source of this? Tell me more about this UA confession page? What sort of people post stuff on there and why do people look at that page? 

00:07:35
TYLER WILLIAMS Right, it seems like it's just different students at the University that are always posting on it. People look at it, I think, just because it's kind of that, people don't really admit a lot that they look at it but people still do because it's really interesting 'cuz you're always worried that your name will show up or that, and you're always interested to see whether someone's gonna post some juicy gossip about someone so it's more of a curiosity I think. 

00:08:10
Sheri Bauman 

00:08:10
SHERI BAUMAN And do most people assume, would you say, that what they read on there is true or more that it's kind of, like you say, racy gossip that's fun to think about? 

00:08:20
Tyler Williams 

00:08:20
TYLER WILLIAMS I think a lot of people think that it's true. Some people might hope that some of it's true maybe because it would be more interesting, I don't know but I definitely, I think, you know at the same time, a lot of people know that it's probably, a lot of people are very skeptical about it but some people aren't skeptical and they just read it and kind of say, oh, this happened. 

00:08:45
SHERI BAUMAN So your girlfriend, is she easily taken in by that kind of stuff? Would she be someone who says, oh, this is on the confessions page it must be true or is she more likely to say, somebody had an ax to grind or someone was looking for attention? 

00:09:00
TYLER WILLIAMS Well, I don't know. I mean, she can fall for that sometimes, she can be a little gullible but I guess, she knows part of the whole, she knows part of the story and she knows that I've been having trouble with a couple of students I guess so maybe she would, maybe she would look at it as being truthful or I think my biggest worry is that it will plant something in her head that's not accurate, instead of, you know, instead of her just saying, oh, well this has to be true, to kind of start making her think, you know. 

00:09:45
SHERI BAUMAN Is she, if you were going to be unfaithful does she think you'd be stupid enough to do it with an undergraduate in a class that your TAing for? 

00:09:55
TYLER WILLIAMS I hope not. Probably not. 

00:10:00
SHERI BAUMAN So that would be your history with her is one piece of evidence that this is not typical behavior, you guys have been together, she's had no reason to be suspicious. The fact that this was posted anonymously in such a public place, what does that say about the person who's making that claim? 

00:10:20
TYLER WILLIAMS Not a whole lot, I mean, it kind of feels to me like it's, they're trying to somewhat directly attack me but not really directly, like they want me to know that it's about me, I don't know and I don't know if they, you know, maybe their friends know but I think it's sort of there to kind of make me a little bit nervous and freaking out a little bit. 

00:10:50
SHERI BAUMAN So their motors are not really to unburden themselves, like the confessions thing would kind of, it's more to hurt you or plant doubts in people's minds about you? 

00:11:00
TYLER WILLIAMS Right, yeah, it didn't feel like she was, you know, confessing this to the world as some sort of, something to help her, it was just kind of, yeah, plant, yeah, make me a little bit nervous and, I don't know, it obviously has but she did pretty well. 

00:11:20
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, and you and I are trying to look at this and see whether that anxiety has a basis in fact so the first thing is that I'm gonna kind of summarize that the person who made this accusation which is really what it is, chose a way to do it that's pretty slimy, kind of, you know, backdoor, not directly, they don't own it and say, you know, I was wronged but they put it on this page. Your girlfriend, you know what, I know you, I know that your peers in the program know you and see you as a very solid, dependable, loyal person so, and this is my, I have looked at the UA confessions page, partly out of my professional interest in this stuff but as soon as I looked at that I thought, I would not believe a single word on here. Some of those things are so extreme and so graphic and I'm wondering if people who know you would have a similar reaction, especially, for example, your girlfriend, that she would just say, you know what, somebody, maybe was unhappy with a grade in that class and looked at a way to kind of get back at you, what do you think? 

00:12:35
TYLER WILLIAMS It's, it's definitely possible that, that they would look at it that way. I guess, I tend to think, you know, in this situation, I'm kind of thinking worst case which is, that somebody's going to read it and kind of assume that everything's true and fall into that trap and, you know, I really, I would hope that somebody wouldn't read it like that but it's that uncertainty and, I don't know, it makes me think it's quite possible that they did read it, you know, and think, oh wow, what if this is true. 

00:13:15
SHERI BAUMAN 

00:13:15
SHERI BAUMAN Right, so can we, as we look at the context, the source, and your reputation, can we take that anxiety down just a little notch do you think? 

00:13:25
Tyler Williams 

00:13:25
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, yeah I think, you know, it's something that, you know I don't really think about because even though I know that it's a fairly ridiculous page I kind of assume that other people might not think that but, you know, I understand that there might be more people that think, like I do when they read it and it's not something that I read, hardly ever, I kind of, just happened to be looking at it one day because one of my friends said that, like, they basically told me it was this ridiculous page and so they obviously thought that it was ridiculous too. 

00:14:10
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, so maybe that takes a little edge off the anxiety. Knowing that someone sort of slandered you, you have some choices, right, you could totally ignore it and let it blow over. What are some other options? 

00:14:25
TYLER WILLIAMS One thing that I've been thinking about and I think it was more of a, more to be proactive and kind of make sure that my name was completely cleared was talking to the professor for the class and just kind of telling him, hey, I've had these interactions with a student that lead me to believe that they might be the ones that posted this and it might be about me but I just wanted to come to you first and say that nothing happened and, you know, so if, I guess that was one thing I was thinking about because I know the professor pretty well for the class. 

00:15:00
SHERI BAUMAN And your girlfriend, would you also, in case she hasn't seen it, would you have a similar conversation with her? 

00:15:10
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, I don't think she's seen it. She definitely hasn't said anything, she knows that I've been kind of nervous or I've been worried about something, she could tell. So yeah, it might be a good thing to just kind of just tell her, I think one of my students did this, might not be a bad idea. 

00:15:25
SHERI BAUMAN So being proactive and alerting the people who you're most concerned about getting a mistaken impression is one, is there any, do you have interest in taking that a step further in terms of helping other people maybe avoid a similar dilemma? 

00:15:50
TYLER WILLIAMS Like doing what? 

00:15:50
Sheri Bauman 

00:15:50
SHERI BAUMAN Well I was gonna say, I don't know how to do this without planting ideas so I'm not planting but I mean for example, it's possible to write a letter to the editor at the Daily Wildcat and talk about the UA confessions page. It's possible to give talks in freshman orientation about, you know the good news for technology and some of the dangers of technology. What else could there be in that vein? You know what I'm talking about, taking a more... 

00:16:25
Tyler Williams 

00:16:25
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, yeah, kind of, spreading the word about what can happen. I think that could definitely be an option, you know, I could see doing something like writing a letter or getting the word out in that way of, you know, this was my experience, be kind of nerve wracking. I'd have to talk to, you know, I'd have to tell people first somehow that, who I was close to. 

00:16:50
SHERI BAUMAN Sometimes when we have strong feelings, particularly anger which has a lot of energy behind it, that's an outlet for the anger so just keep that in mind. You know what I'm really tickled about your response to this is that you're not saying, I'm gonna get that student. I am going to post something about them, or I am going to challenge them face to face and say, I'm sure you're the one who did this. Did it cross your mind to seek, you know, some sort of retribution? 

00:17:30
TYLER WILLIAMS I think at first it did but I'm not really someone who's confrontational, I'd much rather, kind of, I know that I tend to be more logical or at least like to think of myself as more logical and more rational so I tried to wait, you know, like a couple of days before I really, I didn't really talk about it I was just kind of thinking to myself what do I need to do out of this but, oh, at first I immediately thought about commenting on the post, then I was thinking to myself, okay, well, if I comment on the post that's gonna show these 10,000 people or whatever ridiculous number like this page, they're immediately going to see, oh, all right, so this must be about him and that was really defensive and that's kind of weird, so I didn't want to do that. 

00:18:20
SHERI BAUMAN Which I really want to commend you for because I think that's, like you say, our instinctive response is to retaliate or attempt to clear our name but in doing so we actually bring attention to the comment and that sort of thing so it sounds like you're able to, you know those little commercial things, think before you click, you know just take that step back and then look at, what I heard, that the two scenarios that were most troubling to you or your girlfriend or perhaps an association in your peers and then the professor who runs that class and that you already have a very realistic and rational strategy and I can tell you from my experience looking at that page, almost everyone that I've talked to thinks it's outrageous and not exactly amusing but nobody that I've talked to, it's more about a contest of who can say the most outrageous stuff rather than who's really confessing something important so I'd be, personally, surprised if anybody I knew which includes, you know, students, graduate students, professors, went, ah-ha, that Tyler, what a slime ball. 

00:19:40
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, and that's definitely what I would worry about but I guess, you're right, I don't personally know anyone that, like, reads that page and tells me all of this stuff has clearly happened at the U of A and most people do kind of read it because it's so, it's really bizarre and creative at times, I guess but, you know, like I said, it's just one of those, it's so, what if like, someone reads it as truth, what if someone can say, oh, that's got to be Tyler. 

00:20:25
SHERI BAUMAN What if lightening strikes right here today? 

00:20:25
TYLER WILLIAMS Right, yeah, that would not be good either. 

00:20:30
Sheri Bauman 

00:20:30
SHERI BAUMAN So let's kind of recapitulate, you came today to talk about this because you were really sort of fearful about the repercussions for you of this anonymous, anonymous, really slanderous comment that suggested that you were A. a rotten boyfriend but more an unethical and inappropriate student in a role of supervision. How are you feeling about our talk and what are you going to take with you from that? 

00:21:05
Tyler Williams 

00:21:05
TYLER WILLIAMS I think I, I feel pretty good and I'm glad that I didn't respond right away because that would have, I probably would be a little bit, more heightened and my anger would still be going right now. I think, I want to talk to my professor. I need to figure out how to approach it with my girlfriend, I just don't, you know, it's one of those things where I would tend to approach this as kind of a joke, like, but I don't know, she might think, oh this is serious and you should be taking it seriously. She might get upset about that so I know I need to approach it with her seriously but really with, I think with the professor I can potentially approach it because like I said, I'm fairly close with the professor. I don't know what I would, the professor might want the student to get in trouble which, maybe they should, we've had, I've had interactions, I don't know whether it's this student so obviously, I don't want to, you know, I don't want to just throw out names to the professor but, I guess, maybe alerting him that this is what happened, I think this was about me, if it continues you know, I'm gonna be trying to figure out more things to do but maybe give him, give him a heads up that would make me feel a little better. 

00:22:25
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, so you have a plan going forward and it sounds like a good one. Would either of those interactions, would it be helpful to role play, to practice or do you feel as though you're pretty ready to have those conversations? 

00:22:40
TYLER WILLIAMS I think I'm pretty ready. I think what I want to, I just want to go up to the professor and say, hey, look, so that you know, I know that I don't know if you've hear of these, any kind of, explain the page to him 'cuz, I don't know, he's still, he still has trouble using power point so he might not know about the Facebook page. But I'll just like, explain to him and say, hey, this, you know, so like people post stuff on here, a lot of its really untrue, well at least I hope that most of it's untrue because it's really bad and just kind of explain to him, this may have been one of the students in the class, they may have talking about me. I just want to let you know that it's not true just in case that, my worry is that somebody else in the department would see it and then tell him and say hey, one of your TAs in your class is acting completely unethically and then he has to do this investigation so I'd rather so I think I'll just kind of go up to him and say, hey, this is, this is what happened and if it continues after that, just so he's kind of in the loop and I'm not telling him once it gets to the point that I don't know, it could get much worse and something, you know, something else happens. 

00:24:00
SHERI BAUMAN Sounds like a really smart plan to me. How would it be if we got together again after you had those conversations to see how they went and how you're feeling? 

00:24:05
TYLER WILLIAMS It would be really good 'cuz I have a feeling that even after that I'm still gonna be very nervous and, but I'd like to have someone to, 'cuz I don't want to it's one of those things that I don't want to talk to it, about, talk about it with a lot of people, so it would be, you know, same reason why I don't want to comment on it on that page so, yeah, I think that would be helpful. It might just be kind of a short session, I might feel really good then or I might still not feel great, we'll see. 

00:24:35
Sheri Bauman 

00:24:35
SHERI BAUMAN Right, but again, I really want to commend you for not being reactive and these pages are interesting because the person who posts this anonymous but if respond you're not anonymous and that does draw attention and I think part of this is my perception is that part of the motive for you know, spreading this stuff is the power you get out of being anonymous and look how many people bought into that and look how upset we got him so I think, you know, that your initial reaction was right on not to take any action and I'm glad that you felt we could talk about it. 

00:25:15
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, yeah, I'm hopeful that it goes well. 

00:25:15
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, any feedback for me, anything that you were hoping that I would be able to do to help that didn't happen or anything more tha you need? 

00:25:25
TYLER WILLIAMS I mean, like I've, you know, I've seen a counselor before so I know that you can't just magically fix things so I can't, I didn't expect that but it was helpful knowing, just kind of, knowing that maybe what I was already thinking I wanted to do was a pretty good decision and I felt encouraged with that so that was good so, I mean, we'll be seeing how it goes for sure. 

00:25:55
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, thanks. So I have no idea how long that took or what we were doing but before Tyler switches gears what questions do you have for either of us and have you seen these confessions pages by the way? Someone's seen them, yeah, it's a new, the latest thing. 

00:26:20
How would you respond differently if the situation had escalated? 

00:26:20
Sheri Bauman 

00:26:20
SHERI BAUMAN In some ways my language might have been different but very much the same thing, do people know you, do they understand, what is the person who posts this attempting to do, boy they got you in this first round, how might you do this going forward 'cuz they can engage in, you know, this can escalate and escalate and then the person who made the original post is, you know, look what I did, so you might, I might spend more time on what was the motive of that person, do you really want to help them out by responding in kind or retaliating or trying to explain yourself might not die a natural death if you stopped and then who's most important for you to talk to outside of facebook, you know, and sometimes I offer to facilitate a meeting with some of the friends that their most concerned about, if they're not, we'll take about using Skype or Google+ meeting to make sure they clear their name but I think the other thing about high school is we need to be in the classroom doing some prevention work to help them understand these potential scenarios they happen a lot and so that they take a step back and don't initially respond. So it really wouldn't have been too much different other than my vocabulary and the fact that it already escalated. 

00:27:55
What actions should be taken when preventative measures worsen a problem? 

00:27:55
Sheri Bauman 

00:27:55
SHERI BAUMAN And I think those are great points and to me that's part of preventive education. When you know that facebook is a very common platform that kids use, how do you set your privacy settings and to me, we sit there and do it together. We create a page, you know, we don't, and then we, this is what it looks like and I always use the math problem. If I have 400 friends and I allow friends of friends to view my posts and each of them has 400 friends, on the first layer, how many people have seen that? How confident can I be that all of those people have, you know, benevolent motives towards me. I think that's unwise, I'm just gonna have friends or I'm just gonna have close friends and here's how you report abuses, postings. It's interesting that when this UA confessions page first came up a news reporter in Tucson came to me to ask about it 'cuz parents at this high school in particular and faculty, they went after some teachers and posted some very graphic comments and I always think, you know, how would it be to walk in to teach algebra next day and know that your genitalia had been described in detail online. You know, it was really an uproar and so I was saying, well one option you have is to report and she said, how do you do that, and so I went and I actually ended up partly to demonstrate to her, I reported the confessions, the UA confessions page, I think I told you this if not here you go, I reported it to facebook and I reported it to the administrators of the page. Facebook responded very promptly, they said that the page was not in violation of their policies and here are the policies. The administrators responded very indignantly. They were concerned that I notified facebook before trying to work with them. They said that they, the mechanism for these is they have a survey monkey page so they can screen, they say we only post things that are general and wouldn't harm someone and I said saying the tall, thin, in a sense, the tall, male, TA in Bio150 is naming that person, that's not anonymous, so we actually engaged in a pretty good dialogue. They wouldn't meet with me face to face, I told them they could wear a paper bag over their head but they didn't accept that but it encouraged, it gave me some sense of power and also yes you can report and I have some people on my facebook list that, it's not necessary that there's so negative and derogatory. I don't unfriend them I just hide them. I don't read their junk. So I mean I think, again, you have to know the individual situation. You have to know the platform yourself before 'cuz I know that these are anonymously posted and that the vast majority of people who read it just find it graphic and slanderous things sort of salaciously, you know, entertaining. 

00:31:20
What preventative actions could be taken in a case of cyberbullying? 

00:31:20
Sheri Bauman 

00:31:20
SHERI BAUMAN I agree with you but there, you know, there is no perfect prevention so there are always gonna be situations that emerge and what I'm saying is A. know the platform so that you can give specific things like you talked about, well you can block this person, you know what, that seems to me beyond just nasty, this is abusive so let's report this as abusive and here's how you do that but you've already informed kids that every platform has a mechanism for reporting so you set the stage with your prevention, you inform yourself about the mechanisms and you know your clientele and you know who's gonna be upset for an hour and then recover and who is gonna just inflame this and it's gonna get bigger and bigger and you may want to involve parents and their support system and get some teachers in and alert them to their level of distress or even suggest, you know, a lesson about something related, if a person were attacked, I always use my example, I had terminal acne as a teenager so when someone wanted to get me they called me pizza face so if they called me fat, if they called me skinny, dumb, that wouldn't have gotten me, somebody said pizza face, I was likely to, but those who knew me knew that so what I'm saying is you need to do prevention and prevention includes your education and awareness of what the current trends are, who's using what and that you know the individuals so that you can tailor your response to that bigger picture. 

00:33:10
How do you approach a situation where the victim identifies with the bully's remarks/ 

00:33:10

SHERI BAUMAN One of the things we're learning in the, not in our data but, which I wish we had asked but in another is that when we ask kids in face to face or cyber bullying what are most effective responses, first of all they choose retaliation which is unfortunate but the next one that's most effective is humor. So I had a friend who came up with a program for gifted and talented students called tongue fu and the idea was to help them generate clever responses so if someone, for example, says, I'm fat, I can say, yes there's more of me to love or, you just noticed? you know, get some new glasses or, you know, that kind of thing. Help them not buy into this as somehow an attack as you said, yeah, that is, that's what I am so turn it back in saying you know, brilliant, you're just a star to notice and help them come up with ways to respond that don't get into a, you know, why are you so nasty because that fuels it but this way, okay, you're saying, yeah, so you noticed, good for you. 

00:34:25
Are there any curriculums dealing with cyberbullying that are effective? 

00:34:25
Sheri Bauman 

00:34:25
SHERI BAUMAN In a condensed soup version is as follows, book companies are in existence to make money so if the publisher is someone who publishes a whole wide variety of stuff and has no specialization in this work I would not be so eager. The Seattle Public Schools, Mike Donalon, has a very nice curriculum, that they've developed online and it's available if you look up their site. We haven't had enough time yet to develop these curricula and then test them and see, you know, have the ideal experiment where school A uses the curriculum, school B does not, we give them the same measures and notice if the rates, we don't know that but I know that this is a person who's for example, in other school districts have some curricula that they've developed that is mostly prevention and giving those lessons. I think the biggest challenge for schools and I can give, I apologize for having my back to people I, you know, I gave a talk to parents at one pretty well resourced school in our community and the parents were, I was giving them some basic information about how facebook works and how some of these other things and what the dangers are and what the positive things are and so forth and they said, you know, as we talked about setting up, learning how to set a page, learning how to report, learning who to allow to see what and use privacy settings, they said, our kids really need this and the director of technology was there and said, can we, can we make sure that all kids get this in their freshman year and he said I'm sorry, there's no place in the curriculum. You know what guys, we have to make a place in the curriculum and we have to say maybe it's in the health class, maybe it's in your basic IT class where you're learning how to do power point and presium(sp) or, you know, that we have to say and we have to be advocates for this because we know the harm it can do and even when it's not long term, it's damaging for each kid in the moment when they experience this and it's the way people communicate. Kids are gonna be engaged in this so we need to do that. When we began our study which is about cyber bullying and its relationship to face to face bullying in a lot of things, we were going into school districts to request their participation and letting us in the classroom so we're in one meeting, this was before you came on and I'm saying we want to have the opportunity to survey your kids in grades three to eight, year one and a couple of principals said, what are you nuts? Grade three, what are you talking about? And fortunately there was an elementary principal in the room who said, I want you to know that I have spent the last two days on a cyber bullying incident with second graders that occurred on Club Penguin and everybody's upset so third grade might be too late and we discovered what, what percentage of third graders are on youtube? 

00:37:55
TYLER WILLIAMS I mean, yeah, 80% and, you know, 10% or 15% are posting videos and this year we asked about even more and a lot of them were putting the comments on. 

00:38:05
Sheri Bauman 

00:38:05
SHERI BAUMAN So we need to start this really early. Okay, so we're gonna switch gears and part of, if you read this, I know, I can tell that a lot of you are school folks but cyber bullying extends into the workplace as well and a as a matter of fact I'm going to Ratheon this week, it's a huge corporation in Tucson and they asked me as part of their not professional development but they do wellness programs for their employees and so I was invited to talk about bullying in general more to them as parents and then they called me back and said when we announced this, we got lots of questions about workplace bullying and cyber bullying, will you address that so we had in mind, for those of you who work with adults, and if you work in schools you work with adults 'cuz they happen to be teachers and administrators and custodians and so forth and I'm not real sure, again, what's coming but so, Tyler, how can I help you today? 

00:39:15
Tyler Williams 

00:39:15
TYLER WILLIAMS Well, I know that you might know, kind of part of it, obviously, that's why you came in so I hate my boss. Right, he's awful. He came in a little bit after I did, a couple of years ago and since then I've always had the feeling that he was that he was always after me and he was always out to get me and so I guess. 

00:39:50
SHERI BAUMAN Can you just give me an example? I'm kind of curious what you mean. 

00:39:55
TYLER WILLIAMS Well I always felt like every time that I felt like I was performing very similarly to other people he was always at my cubicle telling me, hey you need to do this, you need to do this and I never saw him doing it to other people and I always felt like that was just, that it was kind of wrong, that he was singling me out. He's just, he's just never been very nice to me where in meetings he's really cordial to others, sometimes he just you know, he'll make snarky little comments like, Oh, Williams probably didn't, you know, didn't get his reports in there and but he'll say it kind of ender his breath and I don't know, it's just, you know... 

00:40:45
SHERI BAUMAN This is a pattern of behavior that's been going on. 

00:40:50
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, it's definitely been happening a few times. It's definitely happened a few times. Sometimes it won't happen for awhile and then, I don't know what happens but it's all of a sudden he just, he just has to, he just has to try to like control me or I don't know whether he's trying, I don't know what it is. 

00:41:05
SHERI BAUMAN And when these things happen and in general how do you feel? 

00:41:10
TYLER WILLIAMS It's really frustrating. I've wanted to quit a few times and just because I hate working for a boss that makes my, makes me hate my job, I mean, I'm in sales and so my jobs not like, you know, really exciting but it shouldn't be that bad and I've wanted to quit for awhile but I can't quit because I don't want to quit without having another job and it would be hard to find a job right now. 

00:41:40
SHERI BAUMAN I just wanted to get a little bit of background for this situation so, you know, please continue. 

00:41:45
TYLER WILLIAMS So, this is probably about a month and a half ago, I yeah, and, I, so, I feel weird talking about this. 

00:42:00
SHERI BAUMAN I noticed that you looked down and away so I'm wondering what's... 

00:42:05
TYLER WILLIAMS So I created a facebook page and... 

00:42:10
SHERI BAUMAN A facebook page for yourself? 

00:42:10
TYLER WILLIAMS Like a profile, not for me, I kind of have my bosses name on it. 

00:42:20
SHERI BAUMAN Kind of? 

00:42:20
TYLER WILLIAMS Okay, it did have my bosses name on it. 'Cuz I was just, I was just so, I just one day, I just went home after a long day and it felt like he was just coming after me and I just went home and I created this page and he has his own facebook page, I'm not friends with him but he has a lot of, you know he's like open, he must have, I don't know whether he's public but I think I have some friends in common with him so, you know how you can do like friends of friends, I don't know. Whatever, but I created this profile and I started taking pictures off of his page and kind of, I don't know, I put him in not really nice situations. 

00:43:15
SHERI BAUMAN So you've edited those photos and altered them. 

00:43:20
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, I'm not very good with like photoshop but I'm good enough to make it, you know, and I think it's funny 'cuz it's just, I don't know, I'm just doctoring these photos but I made, I'm still really mad at him and I don't know who told him about it but obviously that's why you're here today. He was told about it and so, that's, yeah, that's what happened. 

00:43:55
SHERI BAUMAN So first I hear that you thought it was really funny. 

00:43:55
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, I definitely, yeah, I mean, I don't know, I laughed at it but a couple of other people in the office who don't really like him kind of laughed at it and I didn't, I didn't want to make it a huge thing, it was more for just a few of my friends but they, yeah, I mean, they seemed at least they acted like it was kind of funny. 

00:44:20
Sheri Bauman 

00:44:20
SHERI BAUMAN So it served as a sort of release for you. You were able to do something to vent some of your anger and use your talents such as they are and you have a good sense of humor. What did your boss think when he saw this page? 

00:44:35
Tyler Williams 

00:44:35
TYLER WILLIAMS He was really upset. I don't know, I had a few pictures like, his kids are like really, his kids are really close to him but he and his wife are having a lot of problems so I posted a couple of pictures, like that were on his facebook page of his family but I erased his wife so he was pretty upset about that but he was really mad. He didn't really confront me, I just kind of heard through the grapevine that he was really, really upset. 

00:45:10
SHERI BAUMAN And can you take a moment and try to imagine if the tables were reversed how you might feel? 

00:45:15
TYLER WILLIAMS I mean, I don't know, I don't really, I don't know, I'd be, it's tough. I think I, I guess I'd... 

00:45:25
SHERI BAUMAN I know you don't like him but taking that out of the equation, if someone were to have done a similar page for you and changed some of your photos to make them appear in ways that you would not want to be or to be the butt of the joke. 

00:45:45
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, I, I mean, I guess I would try to find it funny but I might be kind of mad, you know, I'm not married so I don't know how, wife, how he felt about that but, I think that was the one that he was really, really upset about. Some of those pictures that I changed with his wife. 

00:46:10
SHERI BAUMAN So here's something interesting. He could have just fired you but instead he referred you to me in the EAP so it sounds like there's at least a possibility to repair the damage. Now you said that you felt like quitting but you haven't and we can certainly talk about ways you might have handled your unhappiness in the position for those two years before it built to the point that you took this step but for right now you have harmed someone using technology, using your skills, you thought it was amusing but when you even look at it you realized that it might be very hurtful. So what can we do going forward? Assuming that he's willing to give you the opportunity not to be dismissed. 

00:47:10
TYLER WILLIAMS I mean, I don't, I don't really feel like, that, that bad about it even though, like, I understand that he was mad but it's hard for me to feel that bad for him so I don't know, I don't know what I want to do. Like I don't want to get fired, I can't afford to get fired but I really don't like him at all. 

00:47:35
Sheri Bauman 

00:47:35
SHERI BAUMAN Okay and that's a separate issue that we can work on, how you manage it when you have an employer because there are grievance procedures, there are mediation procedures, there are communications training and all sorts of things that we night do to manage that situation and frankly I wished we had done that earlier before you reached this point but now we have this incident where, essentially, we can say that you cyber bullied this person and there's a clear company policy that says that's not okay and I'm saying, if there appears to be an opportunity to repair this situation, let's generate options, none of which you have to do but let's, what are the choices? 

00:48:25
Tyler Williams 

00:48:25
TYLER WILLIAMS I could do nothing, he'd probably fire me. I don't want to get fired. I could I don't know, I could apologize. 

00:48:45
SHERI BAUMAN How, how might you do that? 

00:48:50
TYLER WILLIAMS Just tell him I'm sorry and then probably have to take down the page at that point. 

00:49:00
SHERI BAUMAN And is that a possibility even before or outside whether you apologize or not, taking the page down? 

00:49:05
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, he said he was gonna, I haven't checked it in awhile, he said he was gonna report it or whatever, I don't know, block it, something. So I haven't checked it in awhile but I don't think it's still up. So yeah, I mean, I could do that. 

00:49:25
SHERI BAUMAN Did it occur to you that impersonating someone might be a crime? 

00:49:30
TYLER WILLIAMS Not really, I just thought it was kind of, I don't know, I was just doing it to be funny. 

00:49:35
SHERI BAUMAN Yeah, I get that. I definitely get that and it probably does to those people, as you say, who don't like this person but to an objective person, altering their photos and misrepresenting them in a public way, I'm not a lawyer, but I think there's a possibility that would be borderline illegal behavior so you could have even further repercussions than you had talked about and, you know as I say, I'm not a lawyer, you may want to talk to one but in the immediate moment you said you could do nothing, you could take the page down and apologize. I got the sense that that apology wouldn't be overly sincere but I'm wondering what other options occur to you. 

00:50:25
TYLER WILLIAMS I don't, I mean, I don't know, I don't really know a lot of other options. It seems like it's kind of like the three options, either I just take the page down and hope that he forgets about it. I don't think he's going to, yeah, or take the page down and kind of apologize I think that, I guess another option I don't know, like you said something about, like, mediations, I don't know. 

00:50:55
SHERI BAUMAN So meeting with him to look into the source of your frustration that impelled you to do this is a separate thing and I think that might be a real good thing if you get to stay here. I'm wondering if we could talk about that apology for minute. So one option is that you go to him and say, you know, I did, I am the person who posted that. It was my sense of humor that clearly was not so amusing to you and I'm sorry that you didn't appreciate the page. So that's one kind of apology, what are some other kinds of apologies? 

00:51:40
TYLER WILLIAMS I mean I guess it's kind of simple but just apologizing for, you know, for hurting him and I know that, like, like I said, he's been having trouble with his wife so I guess I could kind of 'cuz I guess I knew that that, that he'd be mad about that part. 

00:52:00
SHERI BAUMAN So you wanted to hurt him? 

00:52:00
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, like a little bit. 

00:52:05
SHERI BAUMAN But maybe not this (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
TYLER WILLIAMS It started off definitely funny and then, yeah, that picture I kind of, wanted to, I mean, I knew it would hurt him so I would, that's just probably, specifically what I would apologize for is putting up the pictures of him and the family without the wife. 

00:52:25
Sheri Bauman 

00:52:25
SHERI BAUMAN So it sounds like you're willing to make a pretty specific apology and owning what you did and suggesting that perhaps your relationship is something that you'd like to attend to or not relationship, but that you'd like to work of some of the things that have been distressing. I'm gonna ask, I'm gonna pose an idea and you may or may not like it but part of I'm guessing, for your boss is not just that he saw this page but that other employees saw this page that presents him in a very negative light, right? 

00:53:05
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, yeah. 

00:53:05
SHERI BAUMAN So I wonder if on the company email, in addition to apologizing to him personally, you might make amends to sort of creating this negative atmosphere by sending an email and saying, dear, colleagues, I had I don't know exactly what the wording is, I made an error of judgment and I want to apologize for XYZ. 

00:53:40
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, I... 

00:53:40
SHERI BAUMAN I can't imitate your facial expression but it sounds like that's not your first choice? 

00:53:45
Tyler Williams 

00:53:45
TYLER WILLIAMS I mean, I think that he'd be mad just because he I don't know, he probably doesn't want anyone else to know about it that doesn't know about it. Not everyone, like, in our little division knows about it. I don't think, at least, I don't know. 

00:54:05
SHERI BAUMAN So what about asking about that? You know, I want to apologize to you for hurting you in this way. It was maybe not my most considered judgment and if you'd like I'm willing to send out an email doing this more public with those who have seen it and let it be his decision. 

00:54:25
TYLER WILLIAMS Right, yeah, I don't know, I mean I don't, I'd rather like, not apologize but I guess I'm gonna have to figure that out and yeah, it could be his decision. I don't know, I think he'll just say, like, he'll probably just continue to be mad at me I guess. 

00:54:50
SHERI BAUMAN How are your sales? 

00:54:50
TYLER WILLIAMS They're pretty good. 

00:54:55
Sheri Bauman 

00:54:55
SHERI BAUMAN So he may have an incentive to keep you on. You have an incentive that you don't have another position so there's a possibility to work on this so that you both can be less frustrated but first there's this elephant that has to be addressed and I understand that you're angry and frustrated and perhaps learning some strategies for managing that in a way that not only did it hurt him it hurt you, look where you are. You're here, you're, maybe, who knows whether this is gonna become a legal issue, but it's made things even more tense. 

00:55:30
Tyler Williams 

00:55:30
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, I mean, I'd rather kind of, I don't know, I guess I'd rather get away from, I don't want it to turn into a legal issue. That would really suck. 

00:55:45
SHERI BAUMAN And I heard you say it's awful coming to work when you hate your job and you hate the situation, what if this were the catalyst that brought things out to the open so that you could enjoy coming to work. 

00:55:55
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, I don't know, I mean. 

00:56:00
SHERI BAUMAN Hard to imagine, huh? 

00:56:00
TYLER WILLIAMS It's really hard to imagine, it is. 

00:56:05
SHERI BAUMAN But I think as a first step somehow repairing the damage that you've done is really part of taking responsibility for your actions, we all screw up. 

00:56:15
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, yeah, I guess, I mean, you're right, I can't, I don't know, like, I know that I have to. 

00:56:25
SHERI BAUMAN Well you don't have to but it sounds like it might be a good strategy. 

00:56:30
TYLER WILLIAMS It might work out best for me if I did. 

00:56:35
SHERI BAUMAN So what did you learn from our interaction today because the choice is yours, we just generated some options, both in the immediate situation and in the long run, what did you learn? 

00:56:45
TYLER WILLIAMS I learned about the legal stuff, that was, I mean, I guess I knew, like, identity fraud or whatever it is and I would see on the news that kids get in trouble for doing like cyber bullying or whatever they call it but, like, I don't know, so I didn't think about that and that makes me a little bit nervous. I mean, I guess I could talk to him. I need to talk to him first. I'd kind of rather do it like, with someone there just because I don't know, like, what he'll say and I don't know what I'll say and you know, I don't know if he'll make things worse in the long run for some reason. 

00:57:40
SHERI BAUMAN Well you don't have a crystal ball so inviting someone to facilitate that discussion might be a really good idea. 

00:57:45
TYLER WILLIAMS So that'd be, that would be nice. 

00:57:45
SHERI BAUMAN Maybe from someone from HR for example would be good. 

00:57:50
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, and you know, like I said, I don't, I don't really, I don't like him for sure. I don't know if I ever will. 

00:58:00
SHERI BAUMAN You know what, there's always gonna be people we don't like and what I'm wondering if the long term lesson for you might be, how to catch those irritations and frustrations early enough and being proactive enough that you don't do something that can have repercussions for you and damage relationships. 

00:58:25
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, I mean I never thought really about talking to anyone else about it, I mean, I don't know, I just kind of got mad at him every day and went home and got, and came back to work and got mad at him again. 

00:58:35
SHERI BAUMAN So that's what we're here for in the EAP so [00:58:45[ and this, as you know is confidential, I won't be sharing the content of our conversation but I hope you will take something from this conversation that will be positive. 

00:58:55
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, I hope so, like I said, I don't want to get fired. I definitely don't want to get in legal trouble, that'd suck. That would make it even harder to find a job. Especially if I got in legal trouble and I got fired. 

00:59:10
SHERI BAUMAN Yep, that would be a big fat mess. So how about, what do you think? It seems like this is pretty urgent so could we have another conversation in about a week and see how things have gone? 

00:59:20
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, I, I don't really know, like, who to talk to in HR or anything about that. 

00:59:25
SHERI BAUMAN I can give you the names of the folks that do this kind of thing. 

00:59:30
TYLER WILLIAMS Yeah, I guess that's that has to be the next step but yeah we can talk like next week and maybe I'll have something figured out by then. Hopefully I'll still be an employee I guess. 

00:59:45
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, I will promise you that even if you're not I'd like to follow up on this situation, okay? 'Cuz you don't want to take it with you to your next situation. 

00:59:55
TYLER WILLIAMS No, that wouldn't be good. 

00:59:55
SHERI BAUMAN Okay, thanks. 

01:00:00
TYLER WILLIAMS All right. 

01:00:00
SHERI BAUMAN Didn't know where that's going so there it went. Questions, comments, observations? 

01:00:05
How would you handle the role of being counselor to both perpetrator and victim? 

01:00:05
Sheri Bauman 

01:00:05
SHERI BAUMAN I would talk to the perpetrator very much like, you know, where did this come from, he was angry, he was frustrated, he didn't deal with it so where did this come from? Very often with young people I hear, I thought it was funny and they didn't think that the other person might not see the humor when they were the butt of it so helping them get some perspective and if you get there, he was, a little tough on that score to say that I understand it might have been really awful for him if you can get that empathic response then you can talk about, so what do you need to do to repair this and I think that gives people a way to forgive themselves too so that they don't take on now I'm a monster, look what I did but you know I screwed up but here's something I can do to sort of make, make this situation better and repair the relationship. I'm not one that goes for sorry, you know, we mandate an apology, that doesn't cut it but, you know, what can you really do to and sometimes the other person has, I want you to go and tell Susan that you really started this rumor because I liked your boyfriend and it was not true. You know I may have, it may be that Susan, and I don't know about you, I worked as a school counselor for 18 years. I did a lot of work indirectly with faculty and now we have teachers who are being attacked online by parents, by kids. I can't tell you how many of these scenarios where kids create fake facebook profiles of principals, of teachers that have come up and I've come in and almost always the kid thought it was funny, that they were gonna entertain their friends, these adults don't have feelings, they couldn't possibly have really been hurt and then sometimes when they get that, they think about how to respond. There are no magic bullets folks, it's just like any other kind of counseling situation when you come and you say how do I deal with this situation that's gonna depend on the individual and the family and the history and, you know, what their medical situation is, there's a huge thing but I think there are some basic principles and to me not being punitive, other, punitive is out there in his case, I'm not real sure but I think that could be illegal and then he'd have to deal with that but helping him realize how he might repair the damage and parent by parent, I always work with parents, I understand you really care about your kid, you want things to be better and we need to help them learn how to handle things, you know, you're getting in, you know... 

01:03:05
If the perpetrator and the victim do not wish to repair the relationship, where do you go from there? 

01:03:05
Sheri Bauman And so your goal is to stay out of trouble and for you to stay out of trouble you need to cease these behaviors but in terms of the long term and I don't mean a relationship as in friends or whatever but so that you both can be in the same company, you can both be in the same school without every time you see each other having some negative explosion and you know what's really interesting to me and some of this is on facebook, how you say they don't want to repair it now, even some of those things on Reddit that you sent me, sometimes people 20 years later want to do that so even planting that seed, you don't have to be friends, you don't have to like each other but when you guys are sending those negative sparks in the classroom it's bothering everybody. You need to, that's the level of repair that will call to, not open hostility any longer. 

01:04:05
What should be done when parents become involved in cyberbullying? 

01:04:05
Sheri Bauman 

01:04:05
SHERI BAUMAN I invite them in to talk about their behavior and how what their modeling for their kids, how their own behavior could, I mean I would treat them as an adult who had done this and also have the additional concern about and how is this affecting your child and I really believe that most people are doing the best they can so I take it with, I understand that you really wanted to come to your child's defense, or you really were angry at the grade and your goal was to make sure your child was treated fairly, now let's look at the choice you made and so forth so I treat them just like anyone else. Well thanks for coming, I hope you found something of value and email me. 

01:05:00
UNKNOWN I just want to thank you both for modeling this, it takes a lot of guts. Not many of us want to get up there and be exposed and so thank you very much for offering. 

01:05:05
SHERI BAUMAN You're welcome.
