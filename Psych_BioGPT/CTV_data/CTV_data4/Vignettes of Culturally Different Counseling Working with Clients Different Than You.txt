MEDIA LAB The University Of Iowa Vignettes of Culturally Different Counseling: Working with Clients Different Than You 

00:00:00
DON POPE-DAVIS  Welcome to our multicultural training video. In this video, you will notice that we have chosen to address some of the issues and salient characteristics that are important in multicultural counseling. Specifically, we will attempt to address gender identity issues, religious identity issues, culture and language and-

DON POPE-DAVIS - disability. As you look at this video, please keep the following questions in mind: Are there cultural assumptions and beliefs of both the client and counselor that impact the counseling process? Are there specific cultural differences and similarities that influence the client-counselor relationship? How might the counselor striving to be culturally sensitive respond more appropriately to the needs of the client? As you watch this video, keep in mind that multicultural counseling is complex and requires time, patience and practice, regardless of your cultural identity or clinical skills.

Vignette #1 

00:01:40
DON POPE-DAVIS  In this first vignette, the client is dealing with issues surrounding his religious identity. 

00:01:50
LORETO R. PRIETO  Okay, Dan, well, one of the things I like to do ah, I think I've got enough basic information. One of the things I like to do is just, kinda be quiet for a while and, and give you an opportunity to tell me what's going on and with you and, and why you're here today. 

00:02:10
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Okay. Uhm, well, and I guess, basically ah, you know, what's going on with, with my life, I'm ah, gonna be, getting married here in June. 

00:02:20
LORETO R. PRIETO Oh, really? 

00:02:20
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Yeah. And uhm, and everything is going great ah, with my fiancée and we've been together for two and a half years. (crosstalk) 

00:02:25
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:02:25
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Uhm, I really have a, a great relationship but uhm, I want to, get to what brought me in here, really was uhm, you know, I've been having some problems. Uhm, ever since, really, I asked her to marry, marry me with ah, I had some problems with my family and some of my friends uhm, some, mostly in my hometown, but also here where I'm going on a graduate school. 

00:02:45
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:02:45
DANIEL R. SOMBERG  Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:02:50
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. What kind of problems you've been having? 

00:02:50
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Well, I think my parents, I mean, I get a lot of love from them. They, you know, support me a lot. (crosstalk) 

00:02:55
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:02:55
DANIEL R. SOMBERG  Uhm, and I think they like my fiancée uhm, but I, I, I just know they don't uhm, they don't really approve uhm, of, of the marriage, and, while they like her as a person and all uhm, they don't really want us, I, they don't want me to marry her so it's like, there's always this kind of a guilt thing, and whenever we go there to visit uhm, they just, maybe I'm, and maybe it's just me but I know, I mean, there's this, this tension. 

00:03:25
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:03:25
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Uhm. 

00:03:25
LORETO R. PRIETO What, what is it about her that they don't approve of? 

00:03:30
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Well, I think, it basically just comes down to ah, I, I'm Jewish and, ah... (crosstalk) 

00:03:35
LORETO R. PRIETO Oh, okay. 

00:03:35
DANIEL R. SOMBERG ...she's Methodist. (crosstalk) 

00:03:35
LORETO R. PRIETO Okay. 

00:03:35
DANIEL R. SOMBERG  Uhm, and I, (crosstalk) 

00:03:40
LORETO R. PRIETO Uhm. He sees this as a religious issue. 

00:03:40
DANIEL R. SOMBERG I need to choose uhm, you know, she'll go like maybe once, to go to church once a month. Uhm, though, and, you know, she enjoys and it's im, important for her but it's not a huge part of her life... (crosstalk) 

00:03:50
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:03:50
DANIEL R. SOMBERG ...or anything. (crosstalk) 

00:03:50
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:03:50
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Uhm, and pretty much the same with me uhm, you know, I enjoy my religion. I ah, ah, feel ah, comfortable with my faith but I do, it's not a, you know, a big part, I don't know a great deal about the Jewish, you know, religion... (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:04:05
DANIEL R. SOMBERG ...like the religious details. It's more of growing up in a Jewish culture and all. (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:04:10
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Uhm, and I think my parents just, they don't like, I get, they would prefer me marrying someone Jewish. (crosstalk) 

00:04:15
LORETO R. PRIETO Okay, but, (crosstalk) 

00:04:15
DANIEL R. SOMBERG I know they would. They would. 

00:04:15
LORETO R. PRIETO but obviously uhm, I say obviously, but, you know, it's not a problem for you, though. You, you seem to be pretty prepared to marry this, (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Yeah. 

00:04:25
LORETO R. PRIETO this woman. (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Uhm, well, our relationship's great. (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
LORETO R. PRIETO Okay. 

00:04:25
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Uhm, but, see, I, it is a problem because... (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:04:31
LORETO R. PRIETO He's turning his family's problem into his own. 

00:04:31
DANIEL R. SOMBERG ...ah, parents, uhm, you know, we're close and my ah, brothers and sisters, we're all close, so, (crosstalk) 

00:04:35
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:04:35
DANIEL R. SOMBERG you know, I talk to them a lot and I'd probably get back home, you know, five, six times a year. (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
LORETO R. PRIETO  Uh hmm. 

00:04:45
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Uhm, and so it is a problem that ah, for, for me in, in that, I know they're not, you know, gonna approve of it and it's like, are they ever gonna, you know, be at ease with it? Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:04:55
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:04:55
DANIEL R. SOMBERG and really, you know, bring her into the family and... (crosstalk) 

00:05:00
LORETO R. PRIETO Have you. (coughs) 

00:05:00
DANIEL R. SOMBERG ...make her feel comfortable. 

00:05:00
LORETO R. PRIETO Do you sometimes find, I mean I hear you saying that you're real concerned with how your parents are reacting to, you know, your, your fiancée, how your brothers and sisters are reacting to your fiancée and then maybe even your parents make you feel guilty quite a bit. (crosstalk) 

00:05:15
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Yeah. 

00:05:15
LORETO R. PRIETO Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:05:15
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Yeah. I mean, that's right, yeah. 

00:05:15
LORETO R. PRIETO I, do you usually find yourself real concerned with what they're gonna think about what you do with your life? 

00:05:25
DANIEL R. SOMBERG So, I'm not supposed to care about what my family thinks? 

00:05:25
DANIEL R. SOMBERG  Yeah, I, I am concerned and that ah, I love 'em, (crosstalk) 

00:05:30
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:05:30
DANIEL R. SOMBERG A, a great deal and they're very important in my life. (crosstalk) 

00:05:35
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:05:35
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Uhm, and so, this is the same thing, you know, with some of my ah, Je-, Jewish friends uhm, who have very kind of traditional relationships and they married Jewish women. Uhm, so yeah, that, I mean, this, I am concerned about it. It's important to me because they're an important part of my life. 

00:05:50
LORETO R. PRIETO Okay. Tell me a little bit about how an interaction between you and your parents might go. How did they make you feel guilty? 

00:05:55
LORETO R. PRIETO  Let's get off the Jewish issue for a minute. 

00:06:00
DANIEL R. SOMBERG I guess, it was, it's like nothing that, you know, if you were watching it, or, you know, if you were having dinner with us, you wouldn't, (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:06:10
DANIEL R. SOMBERG it's nothing overt. There's no yelling, uhm, ah, you know, there's no big, mad kind of stuff, but it's just... (crosstalk) 

00:06:15
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:06:15
DANIEL R. SOMBERG ...like uhm, one, like my, my dad just kinda withdraws, that, that's kinda ho-, how he does it, but, and my mom just kinda does little subtle things like ah, she'll talk about other people, other Jewish friends... (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:06:30
DANIEL R. SOMBERG ...getting married... (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:06:30
DANIEL R. SOMBERG ...and who they're marrying... (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:06:30
DANIEL R. SOMBERG ...and sometimes, like in front of her, this last time that I, it was like ah, in, in March, and ah, she starts talking about this Jewish girl who's single who I used to date like (inaudible )... (crosstalk) 

00:06:43
LORETO R. PRIETO I wonder if this is a control issue in his family. 

00:06:45
DANIEL R. SOMBERG ...I don't, I haven't seen her in 10 years uhm, and she starts going of into this thing, you know, of, like, "Oh, she's single and she's so much fun," and it was like what's the pur-, why are you doing that? (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:06:55
DANIEL R. SOMBERG You know, and, and I think that's, you know, and that was her way of saying something. 

00:07:00
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. Oh, what do (inaudible )... (crosstalk) 

00:07:03
DANIEL R. SOMBERG This guy probably knows nothing about Jewish families. 

00:07:05
LORETO R. PRIETO ...a, a, reason other than this difference in religion that maybe your folks don't accept this woman, or... (crosstalk) 

00:07:10
DANIEL R. SOMBERG ...uhm, no, I do, I mean, I think they genuine, genuinely like her. I mean, pe, people uhm, you know, just in general, really like my fiancée. She's, she's very nice. You'd, there, you'd be hard-pressed to find a reason, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:07:25
DANIEL R. SOMBERG ah, to, to dislike her. (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:07:25
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Uhm, and know ah, I, I, I mean, I really think, and the, and I knew you said it, you know, that they do like her and there's, you know, there's no personality conflicts or anything like that. But it seems to be, you, you know, it's just religion, religious question. 

00:07:40
LORETO R. PRIETO Hmm. Hmm. Well, what do you... (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
DANIEL R. SOMBERG (inaudible ). 

00:07:46
LORETO R. PRIETO ...think, what do you think can be done about this then, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Well, I'm not sure. I mean, I guess, one of the things I, that was coming in for is to find out, you know, is there something I, I should be doing or can be doing or is this, do I have to just accept the fact that I'm, you know, in a way, kinda blowing off my, my religious tradition or you know, (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:08:05
DANIEL R. SOMBERG (inaudible ) and ah, and what my parents want uhm, you know, my just blowing off all this and doing what I want, is that okay? I mean, well, I'd be, still be settled. But then, you know, in, ten years down the line, (crosstalk) 

00:08:15
LORETO R. PRIETO Hmm. 

00:08:15
DANIEL R. SOMBERG is it still gonna be an issue? (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:08:20
DANIEL R. SOMBERG 'Coz I'm already sick of it. It's only been six months of this. (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
LORETO R. PRIETO Sure. Sure. And, you know uhm, I think I understand what you're saying, you know, could balloon develop into something more serious later on down the road and. (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Well, it already, it already it, I mean, (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:08:30
DANIEL R. SOMBERG  it is, to a large extent. I just don't want to keep continuing. 

00:08:35
LORETO R. PRIETO Right. (inaudible )... (crosstalk) 

00:08:39
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Geez, this guy's not listening to me. 

00:08:40
LORETO R. PRIETO ...what I hear is uhm, you know ah, through the content of the issue is, is that this religious one, but what I really think is probably really important here is just what's happening between you and your parents, and you and your brothers and sisters? Uhm, you know, all of this kind of guilt that you accept from them uhm, instead of just maybe going ahead and doing what you wanna do, the way you wanna do it. And so maybe I think that uhm, that could be one of the things we could talk about. 

00:09:10
DANIEL R. SOMBERG  Yeah. I, well, I guess, I mean, I, I guess, if I hear what you saying, I mean, I can, I, I guess I am choosing to accept it, but, you know, my family ah, you know, is a huge part of my life. 

00:09:25
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:09:25
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Uhm, you know, it's just very important to me and part of them, in growing up in my family, you know, Judaism, it was very important. It wasn't like we, you know, we didn't read the Torah, or do a lot of religious activities per se, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:09:40
DANIEL R. SOMBERG but we did, you know, with the holidays and uhm, what might be call it, you know, the Jewish culture was very important and still, you know, it's very important. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:09:50
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:09:50
DANIEL R. SOMBERG and I know, I, I won't be raising my chi-, children Jewish... (crosstalk) 

00:09:50
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:09:50
DANIEL R. SOMBERG  and it's like I'm, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:09:55
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:09:55
DANIEL R. SOMBERG kind of, just forgetting about all that and ah, (crosstalk) 

00:10:00
LORETO R. PRIETO He's not understanding. Maybe he's not getting this idea. 

00:10:00
LORETO R. PRIETO  uh hmm, yeah, and I can hear that. I guess they just think, you know uhm, you know, you said that you don't adhere yourself much and perhaps even your children won't uhm, be in a, in a religious faith and, you know, boy, Dan, I, I really think, probably the central issue here is one of what's going on between you and your parents and, and the way that interaction happens uhm, doesn't have to be over religion. Maybe it's gonna be over ah, ah, the, where you live. I mean, it could be any issue, I guess, is what I think, I don't know. I don't, I'm(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Well, I guess, I mean, if you take a look at other areas like where I live or, you know, what career I wanted... (crosstalk) 

00:10:40
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:10:40
DANIEL R. SOMBERG ...uhm, you know, they're, they're not the kind of meddling parents, always have to have a voice, you now, in my decisions. It isn't that kind a thing. I mean, I think it... (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:10:50
DANIEL R. SOMBERG ...is, it's this ah, the issue of my, you know, my mom, her mother died two years ago and her mother was very religious. She kept a kosher house. Uhm, you know, she re-, read the Torah each morning. I mean it was just uhm, very important to her. And, and now she sees, you know, anything, what maybe, you know, it's kind of the end of that tradition, with knowing, she's knowing that her grandchildren knowing would be, like I was, maybe not very religious but won't even be Jewish. 

00:11:20
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:11:25
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Uhm. 

00:11:25
LORETO R. PRIETO Hmm. Maybe there are some things I'm not understanding. 

00:11:25
LORETO R. PRIETO  Well. 

00:11:30
DANIEL R. SOMBERG I don't know, I mean, you know, maybe this isn't the kind of thing, or maybe I just need to work this out, you know, myself and, I just need to sit and really talk with them and, you know, hash it out. (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:11:40
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
LORETO R. PRIETO  Yeah, (crosstalk) 

00:11:45
DANIEL R. SOMBERG (inaudible) 

00:11:45
LORETO R. PRIETO I mean, I, I certainly think that there's some things that I can help you with. Uhm, and ah, I guess all I can do is let you know when I see those being, (crosstalk) 

00:11:50
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Uh-huh. 

00:11:50
LORETO R. PRIETO  uhm. 

00:11:55
DANIEL R. SOMBERG You're non-, I mean I understand you're trying to help but. 

00:11:55
LORETO R. PRIETO Ah, maybe, maybe we just need to talk a little bit more and see if ah, we can connect somewhere. 

00:12:05
DANIEL R. SOMBERG Yeah. I mean, you know, that sounds good, I mean, I still, you know, I wanna work on this and, and I would like some help, so, (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
LORETO R. PRIETO Uh hmm. 

00:12:15
DANIEL R. SOMBERG I'm willing to do that. 

00:12:15
DON POPE-DAVIS Now, turn to your workbook to consider the materials for vignette number one before continuing with this tape. 

00:12:25
Vignette #2 

00:12:25
DON POPE-DAVIS  In this vignette, the issues of career, gender and disability are discussed. 

00:12:45
AMY L. REYNOLDS Jay, last, last week, we initially, you know, after we met uhm, I was thinking a lot about, you were talking about feeling some conflict and we didn't really get to that in terms of the inner conflict you're feeling about this pole between relationship and career... (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
JAY M. HEYING  Uh hmm. 

00:13:05
AMY L. REYNOLDS ...and I thought, maybe we could start off there uhm, today talking about that. If you could let me know a little bit more about what that conflict that you're feeling. 

00:13:10
JAY M. HEYING  Yeah. Well uhm, basically uhm, like I mentioned last week, it uhm, I, I wanna go to, to graduate school. (crosstalk) 

00:13:25
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
JAY M. HEYING I wanna go on for my Ph.D., and the problem with that is that my wife is in a career here. 

00:13:30
AMY L. REYNOLDS Right. 

00:13:30
JAY M. HEYING And she's working on her master's here and I don't wanna make her give up all that to kind of follow me off to, uhm, get my Ph.D. Uhm, (inaudible )... (crosstalk) 

00:13:44
AMY L. REYNOLDS I wonder how Jay would deal with the demands of a doctoral program. 

00:13:45
JAY M. HEYING ...uhm, of me doing that. Uhm, I don't know if I'd feel guilty about asking her that... (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uh hmm. 

00:13:50
JAY M. HEYING ...or, or, or what. 

00:13:55
AMY L. REYNOLDS So some conflict about putting your needs first? 

00:13:55
JAY M. HEYING Yeah, yeah, definitely. Definitely. 

00:14:00
AMY L. REYNOLDS So, your wanting to do, I know you got your master's, (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
JAY M. HEYING Uh hmm. 

00:14:00
AMY L. REYNOLDS you want to do a Ph., Ph.D.? 

00:14:05
JAY M. HEYING Yeah. 

00:14:05
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uhm, in, in, in what area? 

00:14:05
JAY M. HEYING  Uhm, probably rehabilitation psychology. (crosstalk) 

00:14:10
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uh hmm. 

00:14:10
JAY M. HEYING Uhm, I have my master's in voc rehab. (crosstalk) 

00:14:15
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uh hmm. 

00:14:15
JAY M. HEYING Uhm, I would like to continue on with that. 

00:14:15
AMY L. REYNOLDS That's a, that's kind of a big step to go from master's to a, to a Ph.D. uhm, much longer time commitment uhm, uhm, I guess, more intense ah, demands and I'm wondering uhm, how you feel about making that step and if you feel that, that's something that you're ready for, out for uhm, something. 

00:14:40
JAY M. HEYING Hmm, but ah, I mean, yeah, I mean, I've looked in to all that. I mean, I understand that's a big, (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uh hmm. 

00:14:45
JAY M. HEYING  it's a big step and there's a lot of work, but I don't know why that would, I mean I think I'm ready to, to do that. (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uh hmm. 

00:14:55
JAY M. HEYING I don't know what, why that would have any, I don't think that's the big part of it, you know? (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
AMY L. REYNOLDS Okay. 

00:15:00
JAY M. HEYING Hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:15:00
AMY L. REYNOLDS Okay, how, I guess I wasn't uhm, sure what, where you're going because I think, you know, Ph.D. is a big commitment and I don't know I... (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
JAY M. HEYING Does she think I can't succeed in grad school because of the disability? 

00:15:10
AMY L. REYNOLDS ...wondering if that was an okay choice or the right choice. 

00:15:15
JAY M. HEYING Yeah. Well, I don't know, I'm feeling like you're questioning my ability to do that. Is there a reason for that? 

00:15:20
AMY L. REYNOLDS Oh no, I think I really offended him. 

00:15:20
AMY L. REYNOLDS  I guess, I, I mean I don't feel like I uhm, doubt your ability. I don't know anything about your academic ability. I think it's, it's just often a big step to go in a, into doctoral work. And ah, I, I guess, I was just trying to get a sense of if, if that was something that you had really gone and thought through. Uhm, and it sounds like, that's a, not the issue and... (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:15:49
JAY M. HEYING I'm not sure I buy that. But I'll give her another chance. 

00:15:50
AMY L. REYNOLDS ...direction. 

00:15:50
JAY M. HEYING Okay. 

00:15:50
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uhm, I guess, I want to try to get back on the course that I guess we originally went, which was uhm, your relationship. Uhm, how have you and your wife in the past talked about give and take in a relationship? 

00:16:15
JAY M. HEYING We haven't really had that many problems with it in the past, actually. Things just kinda fell in place pretty well... (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uh hmm. 

00:16:20
JAY M. HEYING ...up until this point. Uhm, and now, I guess that, that we're kinda there. Uhm, I'm not sure really, I guess, I don't know if we're doing the right things or not but... (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
AMY L. REYNOLDS Right. 

00:16:35
JAY M. HEYING ...I know that I'm having problems sleeping at night and kinda just staying awake staring at the walls thinking about, you know, "What am I to do?" "Is this the right move?" and, and "Can I ask this of her?" and... (crosstalk) 

00:16:45
AMY L. REYNOLDS Right. 

00:16:45
JAY M. HEYING ...and, and, you know, "Can we afford it?" and that kind of thing. 

00:16:50
AMY L. REYNOLDS I guess I wonder and, and, this, I mean, it would be totally off in terms of this, but I'm just wondering if in terms of when you're trying to make joint decisions... (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
JAY M. HEYING Uh hmm. 

00:17:00
AMY L. REYNOLDS ...uhm, if you were ever concerned that, uhm, you know, as you struggle with, or, or deal with issues in regards to your own career and those sort of choices and, and integrating that with your, your disability if you're sometimes concerned that (inaudible )... (crosstalk) 

00:17:18
JAY M. HEYING Here we go again, with the disability thing. 

00:17:20
AMY L. REYNOLDS ...in a sense, maybe your wife might try to meet your needs uhm, because of that or if that's ever an issue. (crosstalk) 

00:17:25
JAY M. HEYING If, if you mean if she's feeling sorry for me and that, that, that's, "Well, Jay's gonna do it and I need to take care of him." I mean, I don't think so. (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
AMY L. REYNOLDS Yeah. 

00:17:35
JAY M. HEYING I don't think the relationship would've gone as far as it has gone if that's the basis for it. (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uh hmm. 

00:17:40
JAY M. HEYING I mean, that's, I hope not. (crosstalk) 

00:17:45
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uh hmm. 

00:17:45
JAY M. HEYING I, I don't think so. 

00:17:45
AMY L. REYNOLDS Okay. Uhm, so you feel like that it, that's not something that you ever sort of fear or wonder in the back of your mind. You, you feel for it, pretty trusting in terms of her motives and uhm, her ah, sort of ah, negotiating issues with you up 'til this point, it hasn't been an issue? 

00:18:05
JAY M. HEYING No uhm, I was in the chair long before I met her and if, you know, if the, if the chair's gonna turn somebody off, it's, it's gonna turn off, turn 'em off when they see and choose... (crosstalk) 

00:18:15
AMY L. REYNOLDS Long before now. 

00:18:15
JAY M. HEYING ...hanging on with me and then I was in an accident or something like that... (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uh hmm. 

00:18:20
JAY M. HEYING ...sort of the pity wife or, or whatever you wanna call it. (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
AMY L. REYNOLDS Right. 

00:18:20
JAY M. HEYING Uhm, I don't, I don't see that as, as happening and I certainly don't like that to happen with people and I don't (inaudible )... (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
AMY L. REYNOLDS Right. 

00:18:30
AMY L. REYNOLDS I think I'm making a lot of incorrect assumptions. 

00:18:30
JAY M. HEYING ...The chair's my way of getting around. So, I. (crosstalk) 

00:18:35
AMY L. REYNOLDS Yeah. So, maybe it's more an issue of not always tru, or maybe doubting that she's not necessarily as assertive about her own needs? 

00:18:45
JAY M. HEYING Yeah. I think that may have a lot to do with it too. 

00:18:45
AMY L. REYNOLDS So feeling like, you know uhm, separate from how it relates to you that just in a, in a personal sense, she might be likely to make her own, ah, needs secondary. 

00:19:00
JAY M. HEYING Uh hmm, yeah, I think so. And I don't, I don't know if that's, you know, the old uhm, cultural thing or, or I mean, all you need to. (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
AMY L. REYNOLDS Gender thing? 

00:19:10
JAY M. HEYING Yeah, the gender thing with, you know, you need to do what the husband says you need to do. I don't know if that's, if that's what it is or not. I'd, I'd certainly try to get her to ex, express herself... (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
AMY L. REYNOLDS Right. 

00:19:20
JAY M. HEYING ...and tell me how she's really feeling about it and that, that's okay with me, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uh hmm. 

00:19:25
JAY M. HEYING to let me know if that's not what she wants to do, then maybe we could look at some other options, uhm. 

00:19:30
AMY L. REYNOLDS Have the two of you talked about gender issues as they relate to your relationship? Ah, is that an area that you've in a sense, discussed in the past, in terms of, do you ah, do you tend to operate for more traditional uhm, assumptions or, uh tending, try to move past that or. 

00:19:50
JAY M. HEYING Uh hmm. I don't think it's really been, I mean we've never actually had a conversation about that... (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
AMY L. REYNOLDS Right. 

00:19:55
JAY M. HEYING ...or discussed it. Uhm, I guess. 

00:20:00
JAY M. HEYING I may need to give this gender issue some more thought. 

00:20:05
JAY M. HEYING I guess probably it would be more traditional on, for the most part... (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
JAY M. HEYING ...but uhm, if I see something like that happen now, I mean, I, I'd try to throw it back on her, I guess, and, and say, look, I wanna make sure that you're comfortable with this, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
AMY L. REYNOLDS Right. 

00:20:20
JAY M. HEYING and not try to, not to try to make all those. I don't know that, I don't know if she's real good about doing that. 

00:20:25
AMY L. REYNOLDS  But when you're aware that you, you make no notice of it and, and, (crosstalk) 

00:20:30
JAY M. HEYING I try to. 

00:20:30
AMY L. REYNOLDS and, and talk and try to at least acknowledge that. 

00:20:35
JAY M. HEYING But I'm sure there are times that I'm not aware of it.(crosstalk) 

00:20:35
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
JAY M. HEYING You know, I mean, I think it's, I don't know. 

00:20:40
AMY L. REYNOLDS Well, it sounds like it's enough of an issue for you that in the back of your mind, you just have this little question that says uhm, even though you didn't voice it this way initially uhm, I don't ah, want Lisa to silence her own needs... (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
JAY M. HEYING Uh hmm. 

00:20:55
AMY L. REYNOLDS ...for mine. 

00:20:55
JAY M. HEYING Uh hmm. 

00:20:55
AMY L. REYNOLDS And that ah, somewhat of a fear that she might. 

00:21:00
JAY M. HEYING Yeah, I think that (inaudible )... (crosstalk). 

00:21:01
AMY L. REYNOLDS I think there are more gender dynamics here than he is aware of. 

00:21:01
JAY M. HEYING  now... (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uh hmm. 

00:21:05
JAY M. HEYING 'Coz she kinda says, "Yeah, that's okay with me if that's what you want to do." 

00:21:05
AMY L. REYNOLDS Uh hmm. 

00:21:05
JAY M. HEYING  How can I, how can I find out if it's okay with her? 

00:21:10
AMY L. REYNOLDS All right. It seems like there are a lot of questions left uhm, and maybe that's the direction we need to move next, is getting concrete. 

00:21:20
JAY M. HEYING Hmm. 

00:21:20
AMY L. REYNOLDS Where do you go from here? 

00:21:25
Please turn to workbook 

00:21:25
DON POPE-DAVIS Now, turn to the materials in your workbook for vignette number two. 

00:21:30
Vignette #3 

00:21:30
DON POPE-DAVIS  Issues of gender, age and career are presented in this third vignette. 

00:21:45
MARIA E. ARCILA  Well, Kathy, last time we met you've mentioned that you're having a conflict with home, work and school and I thought we could talk about that today. 

00:22:00
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL Yeah, I've really thought a lot about that this week, since we talked last week. I, I think the conflict really is between work and school. 

00:22:10
MARIA E. ARCILA Okay. 

00:22:10
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL It's, it's like going to school has, has been a dream of mine for so long and I finally got up the courage to apply, was accepted. 

00:22:20
MARIA E. ARCILA Uh hmm. 

00:22:20
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL  Started in the program, had everything planned out how I'm gonna do this, how I'm gonna work it all in and something's, something's not quite right. I can't quite make the shift... (crosstalk) 

00:22:40
MARIA E. ARCILA Uh hmm. 

00:22:40
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL ...from work and from where I've been to where it is that I want to, want to go. (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
MARIA E. ARCILA Okay. 

00:22:45
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL I think I wanna go. 

00:22:45
MARIA E. ARCILA What seems to be causing the conflict? 

00:22:50
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL Well, I think I'll, that a lot of it is that my job has been real important to me... (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
MARIA E. ARCILA Uh hmm. 

00:22:55
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL ...and I've spent a lot of time uhm, in education, devoted to a career and I've established a professional identity in that career and I'm comfortable there. 

00:23:10
MARIA E. ARCILA Uh hmm. 

00:23:10
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL Uhm, I know I do a good job, and now its, its like not knowing what I'm doing, recognizing that I have so much to learn and being really scared that, that maybe I can't do it or maybe if I, if I do it, it won't be what I really wanted after all and that I should have stayed... (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
MARIA E. ARCILA Uh hmm. 

00:23:35
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL  where I was. 

00:23:40
MARIA E. ARCILLA So you seem to be feeling some doubts about... (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL Yeah. 

00:23:40
MARIA E. ARCILLA ...the decisions. 

00:23:40
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL  Yeah. 

00:23:45
MARIA E. ARCILLA And you're focusing a lot on career and school. What about your home life with your husband and children if you have any? 

00:23:55
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL Uhm, my husband, my husband's real supportive and there's really no conflict there. He's in fact been encouraging me all along that if this is something that I think I want to do. 

00:24:10
MARIA E. ARCILLA Uh hmm. 

00:24:10
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL I ought to do it. 

00:24:10
MARIA E. ARCILLA Uh hmm. 

00:24:10
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL Instead of waiting in time, 65 years-old and looking back and saying, "Oh, I wish I would have," or "Why didn't I do that when I had a chance?" 

00:24:20
MARIA E. ARCILLA Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL  Uhm, and we don't have children, so you know, that's really, that's really not an issue. Uhm, so I don't, I don't see, I don't see the conflict between demands from family and home as much as I do between where I've been and where I want to go. 

00:24:45
MARIA E. ARCILLA But how do you imagine your husband must feel on not having someone at home to take care of things? 

00:24:50
UNKNOWN Where did that question come from? (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL I know, I know how my husband feels, I, he feels fine. I think it's more, uhm, being afraid to give up what I've got and what I know, what's a sure thing, uhm, and having some difficulty in trusting, uhm, kind of what I know I really want to do in this, you know, exciting new opportunity and, (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
MARIA E. ARCILLA Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL uhm, but there's a risk there and still some uncertainty. 

00:25:25
MARIA E. ARCILLA So it seems kinda scary to give up... (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL Really scary. 

00:25:30
MARIA E. ARCILLA ...what you've already established? 

00:25:30
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL Yeah, yeah. It's real scary. 

00:25:30
UNKNOWN  Maybe she does understand. 

00:25:35
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL I'm not quite sure if, if it's just the fear associated with the risk, uhm, I can understand that... (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
MARIA E. ARCILLA Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL ...but it's more like what if I really don't like it when I get there? 

00:26:00
MARIA E. ARCILLA In terms of your, (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL And it's too late to go back. 

00:26:00
MARIA E. ARCILLA your degree? 

00:26:00
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL  Uh hmm. 

00:26:05
MARIA E. ARCILLA So you don't, you're kinda feeling a lack of confidence? 

00:26:10
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL Uhm, confidence with. (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
MARIA E. ARCILLA  In terms of succeeding in this new direction? 

00:26:15
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL (She thinks I can't do it?) A little maybe. 

00:26:20
MARIA E. ARCILLA (She seems really bothered. Maybe, I've touched on something important.) 

00:26:25
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL  But I, yeah, I, I think it's, it's more the, the fear of giving up that security. 

00:26:35
MARIA E. ARCILLA Uh hmm. And what about your home life? How is that been affected by the status that you have? (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL (Why do I have to explain this? She's a woman. She has a career.) How it has been affected? 

00:26:45
MARIA E. ARCILLA Uh hmm. 

00:26:45
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL  It's, it's different. My home life is different now. I, I don't have as much time. 

00:26:55
MARIA E. ARCILLA Uh hmm. 

00:26:55
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL Uhm, but then I never really spent a whole lot of time doing, ah, cooking, cleaning, uhm. I've never been a real homebody anyway. 

00:27:10
MARIA E. ARCILLA Uh hmm. 

00:27:10
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL So, I doubt that my, that my husband has really seeing much difference. It's not like he was, ah, having all of these fantastic, wonderful meals when he came home from work. I've never done that. So, ah, and I don't, I don't think that, that he's missing that. 

00:27:30
MARIA E. ARCILLA So the conflict seems to be more within school and work. (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL And work. Right, right. (Hallelujah. She finally got it.) It's a part of you is that, no, I think if I were going back to school in the same field... (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
MARIA E. ARCILLA Hmm. 

00:27:50
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL ...and staying in the same career... (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
MARIA E. ARCILLA Uh hmm. 

00:27:55
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL ...instead of making a total career change... (crosstalk) 

00:27:55
MARIA E. ARCILLA  Uh hmm. 

00:28:00
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL ...that it might be, it might be easier for me to, to deal with that. 

00:28:05
MARIA E. ARCILLA But somehow you're stepping into an entirely new realm. 

00:28:05
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL  Right. Right. 

00:28:10
MARIA E. ARCILLA (I think we're finally communicating.) 

00:28:10
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL It's so very different... (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
MARIA E. ARCILLA  Uh hmm. 

00:28:15
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL ...from, uhm, the kinds of things that I'm doing now or at least at, you know, it seems very different. 

00:28:20
MARIA E. ARCILLA So what is it about work and school? There's something, some conflict going on there. What do you see as the conflict? 

00:28:30
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL I'm really not, I'm not quite sure what it is, uhm, (Yeah, that's what I need to talk about.) my job is pretty flexible so I have been able to work out 

00:28:40
MARIA E. ARCILLA Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL The time requirements for school. (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
MARIA E. ARCILLA Uh hmm. 

00:28:45
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL And I'm getting, I'm getting everything done that needs to be done, both at school and at work. 

00:28:50
MARIA E. ARCILLA  Uh hmm. 

00:28:55
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL Uhm, but it hasn't been easy and I just wonder how I'm gonna be able to do it. 

00:29:05
MARIA E. ARCILLA  How are you getting to handle all these responsibilities? (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL Yeah, for three or four years, and the idea that at some point, I'm gonna need to let go of the job. 

00:29:15
MARIA E. ARCILLA Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL It's like when I first started last fall. I started with the idea that, uhm, this coming fall, I would quit work and devote all my time to school, that, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
MARIA E. ARCILLA Okay. 

00:29:30
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL I would, had, get some money saved, be ready, be able financially to handle it and, uhm, to really make the split, make the move... (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
MARIA E. ARCILLA Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL ...just do it. 

00:29:40
MARIA E. ARCILLA Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL And I figured that after a year in the program, I would feel more comfortable about whether or not this is what I wanted to do. 

00:29:50
MARIA E. ARCILLA Right. 

00:29:50
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL And as much as I like it, uhm, and as exciting and challenging as it is, I'm finding that I, I, I can't let go. I can't let go of that job. 

00:30:00
MARIA E. ARCILLA What's keeping you there? 

00:30:05
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL I don't know, I don't know. The security, I guess. 

00:30:10
MARIA E. ARCILLA Uh hmm. 

00:30:10
KATHLEEN A. KIKENDALL It's like, uhm, I think, there's this underlying fear that, that ah, maybe I won't like it. 

00:30:25
DONALD B. POPE-DAVIS Now, turn to the workbook. 

00:30:25
Vignette #4 

00:30:25
DONALD B. POPE-DAVIS Culture and language are at the center of this final vignette. 

00:30:40
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ And, and I've read over your file and, and looks like there's some issues involving some adjustment and, and maybe some acclimation over to the campus here. And, ah, I was wondering what, ah, what brought you in today? 

00:30:55
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Well I, I decided to come and talk to you because you know I'm, I'm a new here on the campus and this is my first semester. 

00:31:00
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:31:00
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA  But, uhm, I'd really want to take, you know I, I, I'm really committed to do my graduate program... (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA ...and I really want to finish and, and, ah, you know I've been here for, ah, two or three weeks but I have already started feeling that little things are happening and, and I decided I don't want to the extent that is possible... (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:31:25
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA ...that my personal life or, or the things that I'm feeling interfere with my academic program because, well, you know it's, it's very important for me to finish on time. (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA So I don't want to lag behind, and it's not about studying on, (crosstalk) 

00:31:40
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:31:40
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA on that thing, that thing. (crosstalk) 

00:31:40
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Okay, so is that the study? (crosstalk) 

00:31:40
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA I can take care, but, but it's more about how I feel here, you know? 

00:31:45
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Okay, now, you said about some problems that were happening and it's not your academics, it's not the studying part. 

00:31:55
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Uh hmm. 

00:31:55
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ What are you talking about? What does that mean so I can understand what you're saying? 

00:31:55
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA  Well, you know, ah, first of all it was difficult for me to decide to come here, you know, because... (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA ...you know, growing up in Arizona and I went to school there. I, I didn't have those problems. I have contact with my family and, ah, my friends and to Arizona(ph), and, and it was very, very easy for me but, making the decision to come to graduate school here was a, a big decision. And, and the decision to go to graduate school here. And so, well, maybe graduate school is for me, you know, but then... (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ (Hmm, she's from Arizona, uses Spanish. There's a strong Latino support group back home. Gosh, this is also bringing up a lot of memories for me.) 

00:32:35
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA ...you know, my professor says, especially had one professor who really push me and said, "I think you should do this and... (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:32:40
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA ...you have la cabeza, you know, you have the brains to do it. So. (crosstalk) 

00:32:45

00:32:45
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Yeah. Uh-huh. Ah, so I decided that, that, yes, I was going to do it and, and it was important for me and for my community that I come on and, and do my Ph.D., but, ah, so, and then I decided to start thinking where to go and, and you know, here at Iowa they offer me this very good scholarship so I decided... (crosstalk) 

00:33:05
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:33:05
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA ...to, to come here. But it was a big decision to come here and I knew it was not going to be... (crosstalk)

LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA ...maybe, ah, ah, mis hermanos and everybody was saying, you know, it may be something if I should do it and, so I decided to (inaudible ) but, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:33:26
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ (She's triggering many memories for me. I need a self-monitor. Ah, I don't want to over identify, besides, that's my stuff.)

MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA it's like very lonely, man. (laughs) You know, it's like... (crosstalk) 

00:33:30
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Exactly, now you said that. (crosstalk) 

00:33:30
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA ...people are different here, you know. (laughs) 

00:33:35
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Yeah, they do, don't they? They do, I, I must agree 'coz being Latino myself, I also realize that, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Uh-huh. 

00:33:40
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ when you walk on that campus, things are very different. (Was it a mistake to self-disclose?) Uhm, the decision was real difficult, especially when you talked with your family. Even though you had a lot of support from faculty, what made it so difficult? What, what, what does that mean? What's (inaudible ). 

00:34:00
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Well, you said it was the [non-English narration] close I would say. We, we're really together in the family and even if I went to school and we are from a small town but I was able to go there many weekends... (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm.

00:34:20
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ ([non-English narration]. Then I switch over to English. I don't know what that may mean to her? I know what it means to me.) 

00:34:25
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:34:25
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA so they, my father encouraged me. They're really proud of me that I come to school and they really encourage me to come. (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Hmm. 

00:34:30
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA  But I miss them. (laughs) [non-English narration]... (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:34:40
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA [non-English narration]. (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ  (I do see some emotional changes when she speaks in Spanish. Her eyes also look glassy [non-English narration] no.) Uh hmm. 

00:34:55
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA But, but I started realizing that it's getting to me, you know? It's getting to me. Like I go home at night after I go to the library and things, ah, and I'm really depressed and I want to cry and I'm really homesick and. (crosstalk) 

00:35:10
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Well, you sound very lonely that... (crosstalk) 

00:35:10
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Yeah. 

00:35:10
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ ...you know, it almost sounds like you're alone, and there's a sadness that's coming... (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Uh hmm. 

00:35:15
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ ...from that being alone. 

00:35:15
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA [non-English narration] in Arizona you say [non-English narration]... (crosstalk) 

00:35:20
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ  ([non-English narration]) 

00:35:35
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA  [non-English narration] 

00:35:45
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:35:45
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA  even in school even if there's lot of [non-English narration], so I, there's people I can talk to in Spanish. But here I cannot talk in Spanish almost with anybody to (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:36:06
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:36:06
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA And, and, and, and especially that, people just don't look like me, you know. It's like, I, the, the food, man, the food tastes different. You know? I, I don't know how to say this. Sometimes I think I'm just dumb. I just feel like (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:36:22
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ (The more I hear the pain, the more I reflect them on my own history and my own pain.) 

00:36:25
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Maybe, maybe I'm not ready to go to graduate school. I don't know, you know? It's just. 

00:36:30
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ It sounds your experience here is real different from Arizona. Now, then, when you first started school in Arizona, did you have the same types of feelings, did the same types of things happen there when you first started school? 

00:36:45
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Well, maybe a little bit like the first week or so, because... (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:36:50
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA ...there was no, nobody else from my high school. I was the only one... (crosstalk) 

00:36:55
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:36:55
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA ...who came to the university. Many of them went to the community college, you know, or got jobs but I was the only one who went to, (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:37:05
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA ...to, to the university. 

00:37:05
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ So you went alone? 

00:37:05
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA So, yeah, but, but, man, people looked like me. [non-English narration] even if there were not, people that I knew, I thought I could even talk to them in classes and, and (inaudible)... (crosstalk) 

00:37:20
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ (She actually protects her emotions through humor. She seems not traditional as a woman. But, she also seems acculturated too, I'm not sure.) 

00:37:25
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA ...from the university, but I'll... (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:37:25
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA  you know, there were three or four of us then we can talk to each other and in every class I would find somebody. 

00:37:35
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:37:35
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Here what is happening is, except for this Black guy that I met in one of my classes. (laughs) Nobody, you know, so, so he's, that, (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:37:50
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA that I think is what is getting to me. Uhm, and maybe I don't know how to deal with it, you know? (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ I can work on that. What does that feel like for you because I know every time you talk about that I look in your eyes and see some sadness. 

00:38:05
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Well, you know, it's, it's not easy. (Can I trust him?) It's like. (Can I show my true feelings? He's noticing that I am almost ready to cry.) It's not easy, it's not easy, you know and, and that's why I came to talk... (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:38:25
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA ...and they, they told me there was a counselor here and, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:38:25
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA so [non-English narration] and then he went, okay, okay. Maybe that's (inaudible ), you know, and (inaudible ) what I want is to, I don't want to but I, (crosstalk) 

00:38:41
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ (She's making a lot of assumptions because I'm Latino, but can this be enough to create a bond? Can I really help her? [non-English narration].) 

00:38:41
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA  I, I am really, want to finish school, you know. I came here. I made a commitment to my family... (crosstalk) 

00:38:50
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:38:50
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA ...and, and, ah, man, I, I want, I want to be, I want to teach (inaudible ) history and, and that's what I want to do. 

00:39:00
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Uh hmm. 

00:39:00
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA I have made a decision, but I, I want to finish. And if I feel like this when I'm just starting, you know, how am I going to feel in two years? And this is going to be at least three or four years that I have to be here even if I go to school all the time. 

00:39:20
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ Here, on this campus, when you come here as a Latino, coz that's something I experienced when I first came too, and I'm, I like to share this... (crosstalk) 

00:39:25
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Uh hmm. 

00:39:25
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ ...I think it might help is that when I first came, there really was not a Latino culture here. There really weren't a lot of students here but I realize that I had to make the culture myself. I had to promote the culture myself. 

00:39:40
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Uh hmm. 

00:39:40
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ  [non-English narration]. 

00:39:45
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ And so, I really had to spend time to bring those things for me. 

00:39:50
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Uh hmm. 

00:39:50
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ And when I listen to you speak, it reminds me of when I first came. 

00:39:55
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ (Was this set(ph) disclosure for me or for her?) [non-English narration] I know some groups and (inaudible ) that I could help you need(ph). But I also, the, ah, the other part that kinda worries me is that, part of this is that when you leave Arizona, when you left Arizona, Arizona. There's a part of that also, it's like a saying goodbye part. (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Uh hmm. 

00:40:15
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ And it almost sounds like, when you left, when I listen to your sadness, it almost sounds like you are saying goodbye for a real long time. And it doesn't have to be that way, but when I hear you talk about it, it's almost like, I say goodbye and I left. (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA  Uh hmm. 

00:40:35
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ And I left there, all that behind. 

00:40:35
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA Uh hmm. 

00:40:35
LUIS A. VAZQUEZ And so I'm hearing like there's a real separation but I don't hear that there's a connection to continue. 

00:40:40
MARIA PAPUSA MOLINA  Uh hmm.

Please turn to workbook

DONALD B. POPE-DAVIS Find the materials for vignette number 4 in your workbook at this time. While you've watch this video, I hope you've kept the following questions in mind: Were there cultural assumptions and beliefs of both client and counselor that had an impact on the counseling process? Were there specific cultural differences and similarities that influenced the client-counselor relationship? Had the counselor been more culturally sensitive what responses would have been more appropriate to the needs of the client? 

00:41:25
