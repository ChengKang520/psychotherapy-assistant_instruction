RICH SIMON Welcome everyone to this installment of 21st-Century Trauma Treatment: State of the Art. My name's Rich Simon. I'm the editor of Psychotherapy Networker and I'm your host for this series. So throughout this series what we're trying to do is bring together different leaders within the, within our field, people who work with trauma in a variety of ways, and trying to, and asking them to give us a very concrete way of understanding how they operate in the therapy world, both how they think and also how they deal with the various challenges of dealing with their clients, and also a big part of this series is the very notion of trauma itself. What do we mean by that word? We use it a lot in our field these days and today we have someone who has really expanded our perspective on trauma, its role in our field and the connection between sociocultural issues, between race, poverty, and trauma and how that influences the way we work with clients. It is my great pleasure to welcome my long time friend and occasional basketball buddy, Ken Hardy. Ken, how are you? 

00:01:30
KEN HARDY Pretty well, Rich, how are you? 

00:01:30
RICH SIMON And now that the NBA season's started, I know that's cheered your mood considerably. 

00:01:35
KEN HARDY I'm doing much better. 

00:01:40
RICH SIMON Okay, me too. All right, so let's get started here. So, it's, in our previous conversations, it seems like you, so you're a dyed in the wool family therapist. You've, you were a family therapist very early one through your early training and as a, as a younger therapist, but you didn't really get into the connection and incorporating this notion of trauma explicitly into your work till 10, 15 years into your practice. Tell us how did you, how did you first get interested in this idea of, of trauma and incorporating that into the way you worked with issues, and particularly issues of race and poverty. 

00:02:25
KEN HARDY Well, I think it started as a very personal journey. I mean, I was a family therapy educator and really doing genograms with students in classes, walking through genealogies and realizing that I didn't know my own, that there's ways in which I was cut off from my own history. And so I was at Syracuse University at the time, took a sabbatical and spent time in my mother's native home in South Carolina, attempting to dig out slave records as a way to try and get some sense, some longitudinal sense about who I was. And much to my dismay, that didn't get very far because I didn't know the name of the slave owners at that point, which was actually critical to being able to ascertain the information. And so at that point, I had pulled together quite a bit of information about slavery, and I decided to then convert that into a documentary that I did on the Invisible Wounds of Slavery. And I think it was somewhere in the compilation of that material that I became aware that a lot of the language that was used in to describe the aftermath of the slavery and the impact on the African American family and the African American individuals, that it was a language very consistent with the language of trauma, and so it wasn't until that point that I made the connection between these broader sociocultural events like slavery and trauma. And that began to change my whole approach to working with children, families, and not just with African Americans, but realized that I'd been using the term oppression to describe this debilitating condition that many families suffered from. And then during the, during this process realized that with something inherent in the experience of oppression that was in fact traumatic, and in fact all oppression is traumatic. Not all trauma involves oppression, so it began to really frame with how I work with, not with just racial minorities but with the poor and other marginalized people as well. 

00:04:40
RICH SIMON Okay so take us into that. So give us, at this point we're talking about the early 90's 

00:04:45
KEN HARDY Yes 

00:04:45
RICH SIMON Okay, you know, 15, 20 years ago. So how, how did you, give us a flavor. So how did this become not only an idea in your head but as a working clinician, how did this translate into the kind of information that you wanted to get from your clients, the kind of relationship you were developing, your conception of what you were doing in your therapeutic work. 

00:05:10
KEN HARDY Well, I think the initial critical changes had to do with a number of issues. One, that, that the type of organizing question that I took into therapy shifted from, What's wrong with you, to What's happened to you, and so once I started pursuing the What happened to you, that uncovered a whole different set of information and particularly, and at this time I was doing a fair amount of work with urban, poor, African American youth, and so the What wrong with you question was very seductive to that population because it was very consistent with the language of juvenile justice system that these were bad kids who were doing bad things, and so when the question shifted for me, What happened, I start looking for different kinds of issues. I start looking for issues that were beyond moral, what, what led to your moral bankruptcy, but in terms of what, what experiences have you had along the way that have hurt you, that have debilitated you, and so that was a significant shift in my work. Another piece of it, a change that occurred was I realized that I needed to slow down and that I couldn't work as quickly as I had been trained to work or that I had once desired to work because when working with trauma, that there was a whole, that the context of therapy was so important and had the potential to re-traumatize a traumatized if you move too quickly. So working slowly in a much more methodical, deliberate way and really with a, with making concerted effort to create safety in the room was another major shift in the work that, that was necessary once I began to think about those to whom I was working as being victims of trauma rather than thinking of them as perpetrators. And many of them were perpetrators and that they had done some pretty horrific things out in the world, but I was able to see them in a much more complex, much more nuanced way, that thinking of them not just perpetrators but perpetrators who was once perpetrated before they became perpetrators. 

00:07:25
RICH SIMON So this, this early stage, I mean, so as you're describing tough kids, some of them have been violent, that they're not the nice, polite middle-classed therapy clients that many of us are familiar with. So can you, so this business of what happened to, even getting that information, sounds like that's your first challenge. These kids do not, in many cases I would think, want to present themselves as vulnerable, as, as anything other than, that's a big piece of it, isn't it, that they're tough and they're survivors. 

00:08:00
KEN HARDY Well, that is, and they all come into therapy with this never let them see you sweat kind of attitude. And so that there isn't this openness and willingness, this open their hearts up, and I had, I remember just last week, I had a kid come in who stormed out in the middle of the session because he's saying to me, pointing his finger to me, very aggressively, I told you you're not going to get in my damn business. You're not going to get in, and this was his reaction to me asking him a question about his personal life that he was so upset with me, he was irate, that he got up and he, he just stormed out of the room. He's come back since then I think that what I attempt to do with kids like this is, in the midst of all the trauma, the chaos, the horrific things they do, that I always feel that it's incumbent upon me as a therapist working with youth who have been traumatized to find the hero in every youth, that there's always some heroic event or some piece of a hero in the midst of this horrific person and so early on in the process of therapy, I felt like it's incumbent upon me to find that, that heroic component and to play that back to the client because that later serves as a resource for the therapy to build on. 

00:09:25
RICH SIMON So tell us about, give us an example of how you do that in a, in a situation with a kid where most of us would not think, There's a hero buried inside there. We just think, This is a scary kid. This is a tough kid. This is a tough nut to crack. SO just give us a flavor of how you work and how you begin the process of discovering that. 

00:09:45
KEN HARDY Well, early on, part of this finding a hero is about really finding redeemable parts in the young person that, and it's kind of like this, this mantra about love, you know, that love denied expression is love denied. And so if I see the redeemable part and fail to comment on it, then it's almost like a failure to see it. So this kid who stormed out, one of things I said to him was that, that I admired tremendously about his ability to sort of keep things real in his life and so in a point where I had pushed him beyond the point which he wished to be pushed, that he kept it, that he kept it really real with me. And that I appreciated that about him and that was a redeemable part of him and so that, and you know there's always a risk because I mean, he could have responded by telling me to go to hell and keep that and with my psychobabble. But I thought it had resonance with him and it got some traction with him and so just that little piece was about finding what was heroic in him, and so I mean, it doesn't matter. It could be the child who grows up in a family of seven siblings, and six of whom are incarcerated or strung out on drugs, and that somehow he managed to escape that narrative, then I identify that as a hero in him, that's a heroic part of him that then gives me something to work on and something to build on. 

00:11:20
RICH SIMON Okay, so what happens, give us a flavor, so the, your, so there's, there's trauma with a big T 

00:11:35
KEN HARDY Yes 

00:11:35
RICH SIMON An obvious event that somebody has experienced, a car accident, some guy has come back from a war zone, those kinds of things and then there's this, and then for the purposes of this conversation, let's call it therapy with a small t, where there's not a specific event, there's not a particular thing that's happened, at least that's obvious, that is the traumatizing event, or a traumatizing event in someone's life. So when someone is, let's stay with the example of these kids, how do you begin the process of working with them, uncovering that and then the process of change? You said earlier that this is a slow process about this and that's what you had learned. 

00:12:15
KEN HARDY Right, right. 

00:12:15
RICH SIMON So give us a flavor for how that, and if there's a, with the kid you're talking about or if there's a particular example you can give us, give us a flavor of what a first session might be like with you and something of the rhythm of the way that you work. 

00:12:30
KEN HARDY You know, you see the thing about it is that when these kids are referred that, that the word trauma is nowhere indicated in the referral information, so they're not coming in for trauma. They're coming in for other kinds of things, armed robbery or chronic truancy, and what I believe is that trauma provides a powerful backdrop to those presenting problems, and along with that, there are a number of very, I think clearly identifiable, the way I refer to it is Invisible Trauma Wounds that these kids come in with and so right from the very beginning, the therapy that I'm trying to sort of, I'm paying less attention to what the presenting problem is in terms of, so if a judge has referred them, and for some criminal activity, I think it's really important for me not to start the conversation or the relationship with some detailed conversation about their criminal activity, because what I'm interested in is What happened to you? And so, so I'm asking them to talk about their experiences of being poor, black kid in a tough neighborhood in Philadelphia for example. And oftentimes the response is total 100% silence or I don't know, a shrug of the shoulders, or a slight elevation of the eyebrow. And so, so then what I do, which is, which is that I wasn't trained to do, I begin to self-disclose a bit at that point. So I think it's important for me to sort of name the, name that which hasn't been named very early on, and so I talk about you know, my thoughts about being black and what that's like and experiences I've had where I've been, you know, boarding a plane and using my hard-earned frequent flyer miles upgrade to have the flight attendant say to me, Oh sir, we're boarding First Class, and so... so I share these sort of stories about my own experience which serves then I think to sort of normalize it a bit. And then gradually what I find is they'll start to sort of participate in these conversations about what happened to them. And I think this is a very difficult part of the thera-, because when I've had, when I've had other therapists observe my therapy, the common response I get is that, that you're teaching these kids how to be victims. You, you're talking about their victimization when these are kids who are doing horrific things. And so I do think it's a very difficult, critical part of the therapeutic process because before I talk about any ways in which they have victimized others, I'm trying to create a space where they can talk about some of the experiences they've had that have been harmful to them. And so that is very early in the process, and what I'm also trying to do at this point is create some modicum of safety where we can have even more detailed conversations about these matters that matter. And so, so that happens very early on. And then, then the other thing that happens in this initial session, in this initial phase of therapy, is I do very little if any challenging or confronting at that point, because I feel like it's too risky. I feel like we haven't developed a relationship, and the thing that these clients have in common with other, other clients who experienced trauma is they come in a state of hyper-, in a hyper arousal state, so the only thing that challenging them, if I challenge them, it only spikes up the arousal. So at this point what I'm trying to do is sort of use the therapy, use my tone, use my pace with them, to bring them into a much more relaxed state, so it's almost like I'm doing some form of unconscious meditation with them to help bring their arousal state down. And usually it's the art of validation that does that, because I do think that, that even the worst of us would like to know that there's something redeemable that we have to us. So, so that's a huge piece of the initial part of the process. 

00:16:45
RICH SIMON And so, that, I can imagine that can be quite extended 

00:16:50
KEN HARDY Yes 

00:16:55
RICH SIMON in these cases and maybe with some of these young people. Maybe it's, they pick up on it and they feel comfortable with you early in the process. What's the shift, so it seems like you can spend a lot of time laying this groundwork and creating this atmosphere of safety. And what are you looking for, when does therapy move into something, another phase, not, not to say that that's something that needs to happen quickly or does happen quickly, but what happens then, so is that, that in and of itself isn't the goal of your work. Which, what's the 

00:17:30
KEN HARDY Well, I think that's a great question Rich, I think a couple things happen. One is that the transition point is what I notice when there's been a discernible shift in the state of arousal so that, so just affectively, I mean the clients are not bouncing off the wall and, and full of MF's and all that type of thing. It's something actually noticeable happens in terms of their demonstration of affect, their state of arousal, so that's a major transition point. The other is because there's some reduction in the state of arousal, we can now have a conversation that's comprised of something other than four letter words and, or you know that I don't know, that we can actually have a meaningful conversation where there's some exchange. And but you're absolutely right in that, that it is conceivable that I could spend four or five sessions with the young person where I'm offering virtually nothing to that process other than validation, affirmation, which is very difficult because when you're sitting there with someone who has really done something horrific to another human being, and they're coming in for four or five hours of validation, it gets to be a hard sell to family members, to judges, to juvenile probation officers. They really don't want to hear that, they get hyper aroused when they see that. 

00:19:00
RICH SIMON Yea, and what's for you, I mean you're absorbing a fair amount of abuse, I imagine. It's not apparent it's going anywhere. Sometimes it may never go anywhere, depending on your definition of anywhere. 

00:19:15
KEN HARDY Right 

00:19:15
RICH SIMON What is it that you, how are you, how do you take care of yourself? This sounds like a really demanding way of, of working with a, a tough bunch of clients. 

00:19:30
KEN HARDY Well, I mean, I think the issue of self-care is always important when you work with trauma because I think there's the, there's always the risk of and the reality of vicarious trauma. I think one of the things that's a saving grace for me is that, that I don't personalize a lot of this, and I think that if, if it's personalized then of course I end up with looking like a slice of Swiss cheese with lots of holes, I mean, so I don't, and this issue I had mentioned earlier about looking for that pearl of functionality if you will that's embedded in a web of dysfunction, or looking for the pearl of strength that's wedded in this ball of negativity, so even when a kid is acting out in a most egregious way, my mindset is, and what is the heroic part of this behavior that's operating here, because if I fail to see the heroic part, then it feels infinitely more personal to me. It feels like, you know, that this is directed toward me, that I'm not getting much traction, but, but, and this is where for me the framework of trauma is really important because I think that, that acting out, that egregious behavior is nothing more than an expression of, of the person's trauma. And so that, and to me that's the real trick of the work that, that when someone is in that mode where they're expressing the pieces of their traumatized experience, it's where therapy's at its most delicate moment but it's also where therapy's at its most difficult moment because that I think the opportunity to get hooked and pulled in is quite extreme at that point. So, so that if I'm actually validating someone and affirming them, and in response to my efforts to validate, they're cursing me out for example, that is hard to stay on course and continue to validate when, when what, the thing I'm most assured of is that I'm going to be called an MF or something worse in that, in response to that. But it's important to sort of stay on track there. 

00:21:45
RICH SIMON Okay, so, so one of things you're sort of saying is there's a, a, some slowing down, some degree of calming, so there's a feeling of, I can have, I can begin to have a conversation with this kid. He's not just a tough kids who's, who seems really mean but you're getting inside this, this story. So when you shift into, as a therapist, once this begins to happen, are you doing different things? What is the next stage for you in your development of your relationship with kids like this? 

00:22:20
KEN HARDY Well, the next stage is, because what I believe is that, so here it is succinctly. So in his first phase, what I believe is that I have to create safety, I have to create context for this broader narrative to be incorporated into the process of therapy. What that requires of me is to do infinitely more listening than I do talking. It requires me to do more validating than challenging. And it requires me to do more holding of the client's experience than pushing or asking questions about it. So that's the first, now once the shift takes place, that what I believe is that there are a number of invisible wounds that, that are a by-product of the sociocultural trauma. So at this point, I'm beginning to sort of name those wounds because up until this point they have no name, and because they have no name they don't exist, and so, so what you have are these experiences organizing the behavior of these young people and there's no way to talk about it because there's no name for it, and they, they simply don't understand it. So this is the point where I might talk about for example, the phenomenon, and this is usually the entry point, to talk with the young person about the phenomenon of respect and there's a point of my career, respect, yea, and so there's a point in my career where I would ask young people about experiences where they had been disrespected. And um, and I ran into a brick wall with that because I would get blank faces or I would get a very strong aggressive reaction. And then it occurred to me that I was framing the question inappropriately, because to ask a young person who's full of bravado when, to talk about experiences where they've been disrespected, would be disrespectful to even own that you've ever been disrespected. So, so just changing the language there where I would, I often ask at this transition point, so tell me about a time when someone in your life attempted to disrespect you. And so just the insertion of "attempted" made a huge difference in the conversation. And so when I ask these questions, I'm asking them about as a black kid, as a poor kid, at a time in your family, and so as these somewhat segregated stories begin to emerge, my job as a therapist is to be a good seamstress an begin to stitch these together so that, so that what the kids gets is a complete picture back, oh so here's common thread where there's been this attempt to disrespect you because what I'm getting at that point is I believe that one of the invisible wounds that young people sustain as a result of these experiences of sociocultural trauma is this notion of devaluation, humiliation. And so trying to get at, and I think it's devaluation, humiliation, which is the epodes for a lot of the acting out behavior that people do. 

00:25:25
RICH SIMON Okay 

00:25:30
KEN HARDY So, so this conversation about, and what I, what I really sort of refer to it as the dis-discourse. And what the dis-discourse is about is experiences where there's been some attempt to disrespect the person sitting in front of me and have them talk about those experiences. 

00:25:45
RICH SIMON Okay, so how do, as the seamstress, as putting together, give me some, a bit of the flavor of that. So what might you be hearing and how, what might your response to these stories, these otherwise disconnected stories, what might they be? 

00:26:05
KEN HARDY So one kid talked about, for example, which is, which is a common theme, about going into Wal-Mart and this was around the Christmas holidays, and felt like he was followed throughout his time in the store. He spent 45 minutes in the store, and he said every fucking 40, every fucking minute of the 45 minutes they're following, and they think I'm so damn stupid I don't know they're following me. So there's this discourse about multiple layers of disrespect. So when I ask him how does he make sense out of that, and so he looks at me with a sense of indignation, says well you know what I mean, it's about being black. It's about being black. And so he goes on to talk about this experience, and so then I ask him about other experiences where he's felt that, where the disrespect has come at the hands of him being a young black man. He talked about being in a car, being stopped by the police and those kinds of experiences. Then there are these experiences within the family, where he's had a very complicated relationship with his father, who's been in and out of his life, who's been in and out of jail, and where the father has made any number of broken promises to him. And so tie that into dis-, into disrespect as well, so here, so you're getting disrespected over here out in the sort of public arena, and then here, the own flesh of your flesh has dissed you in some ways, or attempted to dis you, and so that's, that's a big pill for him to swallow. And this can only happen in this middle phase of therapy where he would even begin to entertain this because if I said this early on, no doubt I would've gotten cursed out, or was stormed out of the room, but he was at a place where he could hear this and then begin to connect these experiences and then, then begin to look at what is his response, what is his typical predictable response to disrespect? Well, it's to engage and sometimes behavior that is ultimately self-destructive. And so, so as a seamstress, I'm connecting those pieces for him. 

00:28:10
RICH SIMON Okay, all right. And so, and what is it, so as he tells you these stories, in his mind, his relationship with his dad, his experience in Wal-Mart, maybe something's going on in school, those may not be connected for him yet. 

00:28:25
KEN HARDY Right, right. 

00:28:30
RICH SIMON Often, what you're saying often they're not. 

00:28:30
KEN HARDY That's absolutely right, they're not. 

00:28:35
RICH SIMON And so, the way in which, what's the language like, that you use? How does it, how does it sound as you begin to, first of all now you're listening this cause this is not material kids, sounds like, are very interested in talking about, these are painful experiences. How do you even at this stage in the relationship get them to talk about it, and then how do you begin to help them change the story, or connect the story in this different way? 

00:29:05
KEN HARDY Well, the how to get them to talk about it, and this is where I've, you know, I sort of say jokingly when I'm out on a stump doing talks, where I often say that I've been in recovery for a number of years from the way in which I was trained, and the recovery's going remarkably well because I think that the way I was trained to work with cases like this is in fact problematic because I, what I believe is that if I don't, if I don't engage some level of self-disclosure, then I don't get the full story from the young person so it requires me to share, and walk that fine tightrope between appropriate self-disclosure and inappropriate self-disclosure. And so for me, if I'm self-disclosing cause I'm looking for something from the client that I need healed, then that's inappropriate. But if I'm sharing bits and pieces of myself that's in the interest of helping the client augment his story, then I think that's appropriate self-disclosure. So, so the way the conversation goes would be something like, So Jamar, so tell me about a, cause I don't know, I think being dissed is like, is just a part of being black in this country. I mean, we see, it happens to the president, he's the most powerful black man in the world, so if it happens to him happens to you, happens to me. So tell me about a time where somebody attempted to dis you, cause I know it's got to, it has to happen. I know cause it's happened to me. And so he begins to open up, he begins to talk about the Wal-Mart story. So then I offer some embellishment to that by then talking about if I've had a Wal-Mart story, or if I had a, actually in this last case that came up, it was a Denny's story. And I talked about trying to pay for a slice of pie I had in Denny's, and the cashier's looking over my shoulder to take the money from the white person behind me. And so, so we connect around this experience. We connect around this experience, and says oh wow, that's deep, doc. I can't believe that happened to you. And well, why wouldn't you believe it happened to me, I mean because it's not about being doctor, the points about being black. That's what I'm saying to you. Says yea you're right about that, it, yea that is, and that's messed up man, that's messed up. So that opens up a conversation. 

00:31:20
RICH SIMON Yea 

00:31:20
KEN HARDY Because what I'm doing is I'm self-disclosing, I'm validating his experience. Now there may be any number of issues embedded within this Wal-Mart story that are worthy of challenging so, so what's left from the story at this point is that you're in Wal-Mart Christmas eve, but you have on a big hoody with your head covered so there's a way in which you look dangerously suspicious. But at this point, that, it serves no purpose to introduce that into the conversation. That's for down the road. 

00:31:55
RICH SIMON Yea, okay. So now, this, I'm getting it. So and where do we go then. So as you're, so I'm getting I think the understanding that there's kind of this process and where you're taking it. And so at the point where this, the kid feels, boy this guy really, he's been there, he really understands this kind of an experience, what's, what's the, and that seems really important to, even to get to that point, what's the next step for you? Where, where do you want to take it from there? 

00:32:25
KEN HARDY Okay well let me just say this before I do, Rich, because it's interesting because what he said to me in response to this interchange was, you know I think I really like you because you really know how to keep it real, and it was interesting to me because that's, and this has nothing to do with trauma but I think it is important that at this point he's beginning to play back to me a word that I had used to describe his heroic part. And so that let, that let me know that there had been some traction and this represented a pivotal point in the therapy where we could shift gears. And so the shifting of the gears then is about, so I'm actually just, I'm getting him to walk me through the description of an experience he's having, but up until this point this experience has no name, and so what I attempt to do is to name it so it becomes a shorthand for us to fall back on in therapy, so, so I said yea, so what they talk about this experience I talk about the ways in which, you know, yea this piece about yea, I call this being devalued, and it's like it's a big fancy word but when you break it down, de- take away, value means your value, and so we always have this experience and so I think you have to be more mindful to think about look at the ways in which, when there's an attempt to disrespect you and take away your value, that what you can ill afford to do at that point is act in ways that collude with that. And so this is something, so this becomes a tool for the toolkit, he understands this, so introduced him to this big word "devaluation" which I said is another word for disrespect. What it means is you've been disrespected, and so part of being black in this, in America means living with disrespect. If you look at your mom, your mom has been dis-, you can find ways in which your mom has been disrespected. In fact, when you come back next week, I want you to be able to, I want you to give me a couple good examples of where you saw, where your mom was disrespected. So now he's looking for it outside of himself even. And so, so where this sort of mirrors traditional trauma treatment in one sense is that I'm hoping that this promotes some level of activism in him about a place where he, it's a vulnerability for him, so that now if he can begin to see the ways in which his mom is disrespected, that maybe there are ways in which he can be a little bit proactive, hopefully, and standing up and intervening for his, the ways in which his mom is disrespected. So, so that's where, so the transition point is introducing the, where I'm beginning to name these invisible wounds, and, and they're fairly predictable because I think with this sort of sociocultural trauma, that devaluation humiliation is always a wound that comes along with that. Another one that comes, that I'm principally concerned about is the way in which there's a kind of imposed silence on those who have been, who has suffered from this level, this type of trauma. And that's the piece that is then connected to the sort of hyper arousal state that oftentimes when it's not channeled, get expressed in terms of anger and rage. So ultimately what I'm trying to do is to attack those three issues within the context of therapy. The ways in which disrespect is such a huge piece of this variant, the ways in which that is then compounded by this lack, this inability to sort of be an advocate for myself, to talk about it, and the ways in which you know my silence gets transformed into a kind of self-destructive anger and rage. 

00:36:05
RICH SIMON So, and so this is, you're creating a map 

00:36:10
KEN HARDY Yes 

00:36:10
RICH SIMON With, with the, with these kids of a, what's happened to them, you're giving them a whole language to talk about it experiences, that many of them don't have, and so as they do that, is there, it, we're, what is it that you're, is that like, is that a, is that an end point or what is it, where do you want to go beyond that? That seems like a really significant shift here. This is, seems like something that you've really come a long way from the phase one you're describing. Is there a phase three? Where, where are you going from there? 

00:36:45
KEN HARDY Well the phase three is where, where the young person has some working understanding of what these wounds are. This is a place where I, where I would begin to do, just to give you some sense about how, you know, how this really is a protracted experience because it's in this phase three where I, where I will begin to offer some push back, some challenge. Yes, the world out there is awful and, rather than but, and there's a way in which you have some role in that. And so, yea, I think it was awful and we're always going to, we're always going to be considered to be suspects, and people are going to look at us with a scrutinizing eye, and there are things that we can do to help diminish or alleviate some of that. So that, so in this phase three, that because hopefully I have enough traction in the relationship and the arousal state has been reduced to the point now where I can begin to plant these seeds about self-advocacy, responsibility, their role in some of what happens, I mean, and the roles may not be, that his role may not be equal to the roles of others but it is important for him to understand that, that he has some responsibility that he can exercise. That's what happens in phase three. 

00:38:10
RICH SIMON So let's, if people could hear a little bit of that, cause it was, I find it, I really got this very immediate sense of what it would be like to, to be in this kind of conversation with you when you were talking earlier, so what's this language of challenge like? How do you, how does that get expressed? What are, can you give us some examples of what goes on and the kinds of things that you might say, either with this particular young man we're talking about or someone, another client you can recall. 

00:38:40
KEN HARDY Well, let me, let me take one instance. This all, when I've had people watch things like this it's very provocative, so I have a kid sitting in front of me. He has his best friend who has been shot, murdered, and that his only way of making sense out of this is to have this insatiable thirst for revenge. He wants revenge, and so I'm, what I would not do, what I don't think is helpful, is to give him a lecture at that point about why revenge doesn't make sense and all the ways in which that's said. You know, you get revenge and then somebody's going to want revenge on you, so what I do is I lean into that by simply saying, you know, that I can just tell from your desire for revenge that this relationship was really important to you. That a really important relationship to you, and I can imagine that if somebody that significant to me had been murdered, that I might want to seek revenge as well, that I think that's kind of a normal reaction to have. Now the challenge: And at the same time, I think that it doesn't make much sense because there's a way in which that revenge just invites more revenge. And so, you know, that you're going to leave someone else the way that you're feeling right now. So I'm basically, what I'm doing at that point is really, which I wouldn't do early on, is challenging this notion directly about revenge and why that, why that, in the one hand I can understand why he might want to do that but at the same time I want him to take away a more complex integrated message which is, and here are the reasons why it would be fool hardy for you to do it. 

00:40:35
RICH SIMON Okay, so what do the, what do these kids when they take it in, I imagine some of the time, lots of the time, they may not take it in. 

00:40:45
KEN HARDY That's right. 

00:40:50
RICH SIMON When they do take it in, what does it sound like? How do they, like you were saying earlier, with the "keep it real" guy, you can hear that your language is, that your language has sprouted 

00:41:00
KEN HARDY in a sense 

00:41:05
RICH SIMON within the, these young men that you're working with. What does it sound like when your, when they take in your challenge, they take it seriously and they just don't knock it away, but they incorporate it, what's their language sound like? 

00:41:15
KEN HARDY Well, a couple things, so what I said in a situation, just to give, because I'm always attempting to, like I think it's important for me, my role as a therapist, I often say that when I cease to be activist, I probably cease to be therapist, and so what I'm really saying to him about this revenge thing is that I understand why you want to do this. The challenge comes in that, and I think it would be crazy for you to do this, in the spirit of keeping it real with him, and I think this because you know there are too many of us black men who are lying on the street and being taken out in senseless murder so I do a little lecture about that, about what it means to be a black man and why this is like a, you know, a stupid course of action to take. And so typically one of two things happen. Either there's no push back, so there's no challenge coming from him which lets me know that the absence of challenge means there is traction, so he's thinking about it, which is good, or that, in one case, like he said, you know, yea doc, that makes a lot of sense to me. That makes sense to me, but I just, I have this feeling that won't go away, and I don't know what to do about that. My response is, well see I appreciate you telling me that. So because we can figure that out, because my commitment is I want you to live, and we can deal, we can deal with that feeling. 

00:42:40
RICH SIMON Mm, wow. Wow. 

00:42:45
KEN HARDY So then I, what is it, you know, look it sounds crazy. This is that actual guy, that sounds crazy and always think, you got to be crazy to do this, so like what color is that feeling? How big is it? What does it look like? Where is that located, and some effort to sort of concretize it because these kids live in a very concrete world and so the more abstract I am, the more disconnected we become. 

00:43:10
RICH SIMON Yea, yea, yea. No I, just as you're saying that, I feel like okay here's somebody, this guy's on my side and maybe I can trust him. You know, and I, we're a team. He's going to help me deal with this thing that's kicking around inside me. So, all right, so keep going. So where do you, where do you hope to go with something like this young man, or in working this way? 

00:43:35
KEN HARDY Well, where we're hoping to go then, because I think that, and this is true for like what I sort of refer to as a sociocultural trauma because it is so invisible, it is so unrecognized, that it gets so little attention. Now because I'm focusing on the sociocultural trauma doesn't preclude the possibility nor the reality that this kid has had other trauma in his life. So it's really complex trauma that I'm dealing with because there's still the issue of the family origin. There's still the issue of loss in his life, all those issues, and so what I'm trying to do here, that the end game is, is to make as many of those invisible wounds visible as possible, to provide a language that, that he can understand it, that he can talk about, doesn't have to be my language, that he can recognize this and so that, so that when, when he recognizes when he's getting aroused from these traumatic experiences, that there's a way in which rather than remaining in the back seat while the car runs out of control in this hyper arousal state, that he can actually move to the front seat, grab the steering wheel and guide his life. And so, so I think that that happens with this additional information about, this is what happens when, so we're actually walking through situations where, so you're, you're in a movie theater and the, you know the movie attendant, the person, the attendant comes up and asks you to move and you're sensing now that you're being asked because you're bl-, they didn't ask anybody else and, so you can jump up and you can curse the person out, you can even, you could even hit them. But, but to what end? So here, so here's some things that you could do in a situation like that. And so trying to get him to sort of tune in, and that's why I think it's, that's slightly meditative about it in a sense because I'm getting him to go into themselves to understand themselves and a working with themselves a little bit better so they can navigate and manage their external selves much better. So there's a piece of a skill, a skill acquisition, that comes toward this end of the therapy. 

00:46:00
RICH SIMON Yea, or kind of mentoring, or, or 

00:46:00
KEN HARDY Yea 

00:46:00
RICH SIMON All right, well now, here's so, here's the tough one, so a lot of what you're saying, and the way you're saying it, you're a black man. You have this commonality experience with these kids. If it's me as the therapist, or a femals social worker, a young female social worker, and I know you do a lot of, a lot of trainings, what's the adaptation? We don't have that commonality of experience that is going to be the basis. Certainly that initial stage, it sounds like it's a lot harder to move across this racial divide if you're, if you're a white therapist and particularly if you're a female therapist, then in the way that you're describing, how do you help people, how do help therapists to deal with this who are not you and don't have your cultural background. 

00:47:00
KEN HARDY Yea, see, well I think about it one at a time. Like I think it's difficult for white therapists if the white therapist had not embraced their whiteness. So if they're white and not know they're white, then that's very diff-, that's very difficult. 

00:47:15
RICH SIMON All right. 

00:47:15
KEN HARDY You know, like I had a guy who's a psychiatrist down in Tennessee, who said to me when I suggested something like this, and he said to me, that is the d-, that is the dumbest, that is the dumbest idea I've ever heard from a so-called educated person because I was saying to him, the importance of him identifying locating his whiteness. He said, you know you can look at me and tell I'm white. And I said, sir that is absolutely true, but the fact of the matter is that you know you're white and the client knows you're white but the client needs to know that you know you're white. And that's the difference. And so, so I do think that, that for white therapists, have experiences they can tap into that would be useful. And so here's what I, what I really believe and I don't have any empirical data, just this anecdotal clinical data that I have seen this. I think that for a person like myself, with the kids I've talked about, what I have out of the, out of the block, would be some face validity. So that there's still the 

00:48:20
RICH SIMON Literally, face validity 

00:48:20
KEN HARDY So there's still the issue of trust though, so it doesn't mean that I put it on cruise control, but at some point in the process, I get challenged. It's a face validity that doesn't hold up, and so I think that for white therapists, the initial phase of therapy is the most difficult phase because, because of the actions of face validity. But I do think if there's a willingness to talk openly about race, and to, because the key for me is having the willingness to self-disclose. It doesn't to be to say, yo, I'm black too, this is awful, but rather, does it, does the therapist, is the therapist willing to use him or herself in a way that creates and contributes to safety and open up blocked arteries? I mean, I think that's the key issue. So, so it could be the white therapist talking about this experience from their white experience, and say well, you know what, um, and I'm ashamed to say but I was, I would probably be one of those white guys who would probably be looking at you a little suspiciously too. And so I'm not proud of that, and so, like so, how does that, like what do you think about that, Jamar? Because then it might open up a conversation about yea, well this is why I don't think that you could help me. This is, I don't think that you, because you don't understand me, but that's an important conversation to have I think that, because having that conversation about the absence of trust actually will go a long way in building trust. And I think the issue is much more difficult for a young female social worker you mention, because I think there are some realistic issues here around safety and violence that, that you know it's there for everybody but I can certainly see, but I just think if anyone's working with this population that you sort of go in understanding that there's some inherent risks to it. I mean, I just had, just before our call here, with a student who, who's doing home-based family work and she wants to be, but she wants to be safe and I said, well you know, working out in the community, going out people's homes is an element of that this, where you're not going to be as safe as being in your office so that comes with the territory. And I do think even for the young white female for example, I think being able to have open conversations about race, I think are really, I think that's the great, the great neutralizer. I think that really does help to bring the process along quite significantly. 

00:50:50
RICH SIMON Well, you know, just, it's helpful for me as I'm hearing you to understand my willingness to do this as a therapist is helped along a lot by that you don't, you don't have any automatic entry, that your work at 

00:51:05
KEN HARDY That's right. 

00:51:05
RICH SIMON That you're working and you're dealing with all the cross currents and the intensity and the, the anger, it's like you don't get a pass either. 

00:51:20
KEN HARDY No, no, and that's my point. I don't get a pass because, because and, and you know, that's the complexity of it because if I'm sitting with, you know, Jamar, as I mentioned earlier, we share a common here, we're both black. We share gender, we're black men. But there are ways in which our lives are fundamentally different and I know that and he knows that, and so if I try to, you know, bullshit him about that, it doesn't go anywhere. 

00:51:45
RICH SIMON Yea, yea. So if, it's almost like the, there's a whole, that often, it, if you're, if you share social class, race, you're like your clients, there's, you can move into a certain phase of therapy, kind of a relationship without thinking about it. And it just it happens you know, from the first session you can feel in sync. What you're doing describing here is before we okay, before we can begin to get to that point, there's a whole, there's a bunch of things that we need to do here. That we can't assume a trust from the get go in this relation, in this 

00:52:25
KEN HARDY Yea, and I think that it's often one of the biggest, you know, misperceptions and misnomers about this work is it's somehow, that if I share a common hue, that if we're both black, that we can just, that we just go in and push it on cruise control, and I think there as many points of divergence within that relationship as there are converges at that point and that there are no guarantees. I mean I, you know, that my success with Jamar doesn't render me successful with Tyreke, who's coming in next, I mean, so it's starting all over again. And each relationship has to be cultivated. 

00:53:05
RICH SIMON Yea, yea. We have a few minutes here, so bring in, we started by invoking your family therapy origins here. 

00:53:15
KEN HARDY Yes, I 

00:53:15
RICH SIMON where you came into the field as many of us did. So what's the role, so we've been talking a lot about you're working one to one with people up to this point. Where does the family fit into the, the kind of work that you've been describing? 

00:53:25
KEN HARDY Well, the family's an integral part because I, um, like I, when I do trauma based work, I'd like, academically, I like to think of myself as taking a relational approach and so that at some point of this you know, involving family members becomes a critical part of this, because I think that families have a great deal to do with the management, how the young person manages the trauma and so, and there's no, there's no boundaries around this so that because the father's not in the child's life, there's not a reason for me not to pursue the father coming in. Because the father and the mother haven't spoken in ten years is not a reason for me not to invite the parents into therapy. So that anybody who is connected to the child's life, I want to have access to because I think that they, if they're connected to the problem, they should ideally be connected to the solution, so, so that the ultimate point of culmination is, when I have enough trust in a young person, that I can then add to the therapy, bring other people into therapy. 

00:54:40
RICH SIMON Okay, so that, that's the pivotal issue, so if you, if you, I mean if I, thinking back to earlier, you might start, back when you and I were starting out, you might start, start with a family session. It sounds like what you're saying is that's not a way that you typically work these days, and that there's something you need to, to do in an initial connection with the kid before you can begin to involve the family? 

00:55:05
KEN HARDY Yea, because I, you know, like I, the way I talk about it in therapy to families is I talk about it as the family's about to undergo a surgical procedure, and that this working with the young person first, whom the trauma resides around that person, is like the preparation for surgery. And so there's something I need to do with him before I can bring the family together because what I'm 100% sure of from having done this work a while now that if I start out with everybody together, the family will do in my office what they do at home and what they know best - blame, fight, disconnect. And so I want that joint experience to be a different experience. And so part of that has to do with the preparation that I do with the, with the individual client before bringing the family involved. 

00:56:05
RICH SIMON Okay. And so, like in these, so we been talking about Jamar here, so is, where do you, I don't know exactly, it sounds like that's in process. Where do you see that might, that might go here, as you kind of envision it and as you're seeing it maybe in a best case scenario. Let's maybe, as we come to conclusion here, kind of give us a flavor of where, what you'd like to see happen from this point on. 

00:56:30
KEN HARDY Well, I would like for him to recognize the ways in which every time that something bad happens to him, that he has a choice to either do something bad or do something to help control his life and so, and so that's the language I'm using with him. So, to make the right turn, so I'm wanting him to be more conscious of that. And then ultimately would like to get his family involved, that he has a disconnected relationship with his father, I mean, that there's some connection but it's not a strong connection. And so I've already had a couple of conversations with his dad on the phone, prepping him at some point we'd want to get him in. And then to, you know, work with him within the context of the family, and I don't, I don't, I'm not very hopeful at this point, that he and his dad will ever the kind of relationship that he ideally would like to have. But I do think that it's possible to have that, the anatomy of that relationship work out a little differently than it has worked out, and so, so that, that's where I'm headed with this kid, and that's where I would go with most of these cases, because I think they, what trauma does is it pulverizes the life of the individual and then my job is to go back and then pull together, to search through the rubble and pull together all these pieces so this person's life can be relatively hole again. 

00:57:55
RICH SIMON And, and the mom? Where does, is there a mom in the picture and is 

00:58:00
KEN HARDY The mom, yea 

00:58:00
RICH SIMON How does that fit into your thinking 

00:58:00
KEN HARDY I've had, the mom has, the mom has already been involved in the therapy at some critical junctures and is amenable to, to being a part of the treatment, and so she definitely will be an integral part of it. 

00:58:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:58:15
KEN HARDY As she has been. 

00:58:15
RICH SIMON So looking, for me, I mean what, how are, as a profession, it seems like we began back in the 70's, Manuchin and others, there's a big commitment to working with inner city families, poor families, the family approach, what do you, as we close here, what's, how do you, do you feel like you're, you're isolated in the field? Do you feel like there, there's a, as you look at the overall field, a lot of folks doing the kind of work that you're describing? What's the state of our commitment as a profession to working with kids like Jamar, for example? 

00:58:55
KEN HARDY You know, I mean I love your question because I don't think it's a matter that really matters much anymore. And I think that's, I think that's part of the problem. I think that, that these kids have very difficult, traumatized lives and the fact that, that no one seems to care about them and there's dwindling services and resources too to work with them, only exacerbates that, that feeling that, that they're alone and nobody cares. And so when they have the sense that nobody cares about them, it's not uncommon for them not to care about anybody. So we don't see the circularity of this, and so you know I think in this sort of age of managed care and, and manualized therapies, that, that it's very difficult for the Jamar's of the world to get the kind of treatment they have because it just, it's just not where the field is at this point. 

01:00:00
RICH SIMON Yea, now what you're describing is not in any, it's not in any manual, that's for sure. 

01:00:05
KEN HARDY That's right. 

01:00:05
RICH SIMON All right, well, wow, really, what a, what great work you're doing and just what you've done at least for me is kind of open up an understanding of somebody like Jamar, and to understand an aspect of him and not just a very visceral way, you know, just very impressed with your commitment to doing this work and you're skill in carrying it on. 

01:00:35
KEN HARDY Thanks Rich. 

01:00:40
RICH SIMON There's a, those of you who would like to comment on this session and keep this conversation going, it's one of the, as Ken is saying, it's one of the really neglected conversations in our field at the moment. We, you'll see on your screen, there's an opportunity for you, an invitation to you, what'd you think, what questions did you have, how does this connect with your experience? Ken, with his usual graciousness, has agreed to check out what you have to say and if the spirit moves him, to respond to some of you, so let's keep this conversation going. 

01:01:15
KEN HARDY Absolutely. 

01:01:15
RICH SIMON Ken, my friend, thank you so much. 

01:01:20
KEN HARDY Okay, thank you, brother Rich, appreciate it. 

01:01:20
RICH SIMON Take care. Take care all of you. See you for the next installment next time of 21st-Century Trauma Treatment. Bye bye for now.
