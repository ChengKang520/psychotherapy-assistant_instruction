DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  This tape maybe particularly interesting, it concerns two officers discussing a problem with the non-commissioned officer or NCO. As it turns out the problems may or may not really be with the NCO. Watch as portions of their initial interactions or discussions are in dispersed, with their individual recalls and mutual recall.

Interview: Captain and Major 

00:01:15
MAJOR WHITE  What seems to be the nature of your problem, Captain Rhone? 

00:01:25
CAPTAIN RHONE  Well, one of the things I wanted to talk about is, uhm, the sergeant I worked with and I'm just kind of concerned about, how to deal with him. 

00:01:35
MAJOR WHITE Is this the staff sergeant who works for you? 

00:01:35
CAPTAIN RHONE  Yes, yes it is. 

00:01:40
MAJOR WHITE Uh hmm. 

00:01:40
CAPTAIN RHONE Uhm, I have a lot of difficulty getting him to do things as I ask him to do. Uhm, I feel like I give directions that are clear and appropriate, ah, never constructing(ph) checks with me. Uhm, we have lot of trouble meeting due dates. Uhm. 

00:02:00
MAJOR WHITE  What, you know, for instance? 

00:02:05
CAPTAIN RHONE  Ah, for instance, ah, I might say I need this by 11 o'clock and ah, go back and check 11 o'clock and well, it's written to his schedule for 1:30 that afternoon. 

00:02:15
MAJOR WHITE  I mean, a lot. (crosstalk) 

00:02:20
CAPTAIN RHONE It is one example, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:02:20
MAJOR WHITE A really specific thing that you've told him to do, he's failed to do? 

00:02:25
CAPTAIN RHONE Uh hmm. I'd ask him to get it, get me, check that kind of information. 

00:02:25
MAJOR WHITE  Ah. (crosstalk) 

00:02:30
CAPTAIN RHONE By the time when I needed it. 

00:02:30
MAJOR WHITE How you feel about that? 

00:02:30
CAPTAIN RHONE  Ah, frustrates me. Uhm, I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, I don't know if I should be, (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
MAJOR WHITE Yes(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
CAPTAIN RHONE should be dealing with him differently. 

00:02:40
MAJOR WHITE Do you think he knows that? 

00:02:40
CAPTAIN RHONE  Uhm, we've discuss it. I feel like we've discuss it, uhm. 

00:02:45
MAJOR WHITE  Well, is that, uhm, what kind of feedback did you get from him? 

00:02:50
CAPTAIN RHONE  Things get in the way, I didn't understand, it wasn't clear to me. Ah, You have to understand ma'am that I've got certain priorities too. 

00:03:00
MAJOR WHITE  Would, do you have any idea of, about, ah, why he is doing that, those are some indication that, ah, you do have a feeling for what's the cause of the problem, 'coz you're a woman? 

00:03:15
CAPTAIN RHONE  Uhm, I don't know that specifically because I'm a wo, I'm a woman, I, I've wondered about that. I've ah, questioned is(ph) raises something in my mind. And. 

00:03:25
MAJOR WHITE  Well? 

00:03:30
CAPTAIN RHONE  I don't know, ah. 

00:03:35
MAJOR WHITE Well, what if you try, besides just talking about a new topic, disciplinary action? 

00:03:40
CAPTAIN RHONE  No. 

00:03:45
MAJOR WHITE What do you think he feels above that? You(ph) think he feel safe? 

00:03:45
CAPTAIN RHONE  Possibly. 

00:03:50
MAJOR WHITE You think he's(ph) grab him because your a woman, a new, when he's been longer than you? 

00:03:55
CAPTAIN RHONE  I don't know ah(ph). 

00:04:00
MAJOR WHITE Well, (crosstalk) 

00:04:00
CAPTAIN RHONE The, the, the.(crosstalk) 

00:04:00
MAJOR WHITE how about you, do you feel threatened by his non-compliance with what you ask him to do? 

00:04:05
CAPTAIN RHONE  Ah, I get angry with it. I get frustrated, I don't know what to do it but I'm, I know ah, for him, the issue of ah, whether or not I am confident in, in, in what I do, has be an issue in the past 'coz. (crosstalk) 

00:04:15
MAJOR WHITE But how do you deal with that anger? 

00:04:20
CAPTAIN RHONE Not, very well. Uhm, one of the things that I don't want to do is to bind to the conscious things that, that he may tagged me with. So I, I typically don't say try to, to display that anger toward him. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:04:35
MAJOR WHITE So you're saying, you're angry... (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
CAPTAIN RHONE Uh hmm. 

00:04:40
MAJOR WHITE ...but that you really don't want him to know about it? 

00:04:40
CAPTAIN RHONE  Well, I want to be able to deal with him effectively, I don't want hi, to give him any ammunition to say, "See that really proves that you are incompetent, you can't deal with anger." 

00:04:50
MAJOR WHITE  Do you feel he thinks you're incompetent? 

00:04:55
CAPTAIN RHONE Yes, I do. (chuckles) In some of the things that I do, yes. 

00:05:00
MAJOR WHITE Wa, the way you've describe that it would seem that he is the incompetent? Or at least not doing his job. Do you feel he understand his job? 

00:05:10
CAPTAIN RHONE  That's a good question, ah, he say he does. Uhm, 

00:05:20
[sil.] 

00:05:20
CAPTAIN RHONE  I don't know. 

00:05:25
MAJOR WHITE  Well, do you feel that you understand what he should be doing? 

00:05:30
CAPTAIN RHONE  Yes. 

00:05:35
MAJOR WHITE Would it be possible for the two of you to talk about that, uhm, specific terms or perhaps have it? 

00:05:40
CAPTAIN RHONE I feel like(ph) we have. The, the thing that seems to work with him saying, "Okay, now, you've done this. Now, let's do step two. And okay, good, that's good on step two. Now, let's do step three," but that in and of itself is, is too time consuming and, ah, that's what we know it. Takes less time to do it myself than to ask him to do upon, and to have to monitor, supervise in that fashion. 

00:06:00
MAJOR WHITE  Oh, how is that impact on the rest of the things that you have to do? 

00:06:05
CAPTAIN RHONE Uhm, they get done later. 

00:06:10
MAJOR WHITE So you're doing his job for him? 

00:06:10
CAPTAIN RHONE  I don't know. 

00:06:15
MAJOR WHITE  Well, it seems to me that, if he is working for you. 

00:06:20
CAPTAIN RHONE Uh hmm. 

00:06:20
MAJOR WHITE Ah, he should do just that? 

00:06:25
CAPTAIN RHONE Yes, so what I'm, what I'm, looking for help on is, how do I, how do I get that to change, how do I did it to be differently. 

00:06:30
MAJOR WHITE Well, what would you, (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
CAPTAIN RHONE Or to be different. (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
MAJOR WHITE What would you think the next step might be? 

00:06:35
CAPTAIN RHONE Sir, I don't know. I, I really, you know, I get a little bit uptight when talking about disciplinary action. 

00:06:40
MAJOR WHITE Well, now, if you weren't, if you weren't in this structured context, ah, ah, if you were in the captain-sergeant relationship and somebody were working for you and ah, didn't do their job, what would you do? 

00:06:55
CAPTAIN RHONE  Probably with no chance, probably simply(ph) define. 

00:07:00
MAJOR WHITE  Well, ah, do you think he knows that? 

00:07:05
CAPTAIN RHONE  I don't know. 

00:07:10
MAJOR WHITE How long is he been in the army? Do you know? 

00:07:15
CAPTAIN RHONE Uhm, seven or eight years. 

00:07:15
MAJOR WHITE  Do you know if he's ever for a woman before? 

00:07:20
CAPTAIN RHONE He is not, he has not. 

00:07:25
MAJOR WHITE Has he express any kind of a frustration with having do work for you on the basis of sex or the fact that you're a captain and a woman? 

00:07:30
CAPTAIN RHONE  Not right out loud. He's not said to me, "I'm not wanna work for you 'coz your woman, he not said that. 

00:07:35
MAJOR WHITE  I seem to hear you saying that you feel that he is frustrated with that fact? 

00:07:45
CAPTAIN RHONE Well, there have been a couple of whole things that have happened, ah, when were outside together and, and we report(ph) I don't get saluted in it. Ah, that's a. (crosstalk) 

00:07:55
MAJOR WHITE Well, what you do about that? 

00:07:55
CAPTAIN RHONE Ah, sometimes I salute and say goodbye, sometimes let it go. 

00:08:00
MAJOR WHITE Well, if you salute does he return your salute? 

00:08:00
CAPTAIN RHONE  Uh hmm. 

00:08:05
MAJOR WHITE Listening to you doesn't sound like ah, you're satisfied with that? 

00:08:10
CAPTAIN RHONE  Well, I'm not, in, to me it, it feels like I'm being discounted and I really don't like that. 

00:08:15
MAJOR WHITE  Do you think he is waiting for you to do something? 

00:08:20
CAPTAIN RHONE  I don't know. 

00:08:25
Major's Recall 

00:08:25
MAJOR WHITE  What seems to be the nature of your problem, Captain Rhone? 

00:08:35
CAPTAIN RHONE Well, one of the things I wanted to talk about is, uhm, the sergeant I worked with, and I'm just kind of concerned about how to deal with him. 

00:08:40
MAJOR WHITE Is this the staff sergeant who works for you? 

00:08:45
CAPTAIN RHONE Yes, yes it is. 

00:08:45
MAJOR WHITE Uh hmm. 

00:08:45
CAPTAIN RHONE Uhm, I have a lot of difficulty getting him to do things, as I ask him to do, uhm, I feel like I give directions that are clear and appropriate, ah, never constructing(ph) checks with me. Uhm, we have a lot of trouble meeting due dates. Ah. 

00:09:05
MAJOR WHITE  Now, right here sir I've, I've got some of my normal bias creeping in, you know, Captain Rhone hasn't been here very long and, ah, she's a new commodity here, as a captain who's also a female. And right away she identify the problem as a sergeant who's not doing what is supposed to be doing. And the question is already in my mind, is that a function of a sergeant or the captain, she said that she's given in the proper directions that she feels are specific. Some of my own prejudice, ah, and my own unfamiliarity with woman officers has already crept in here. Some of my feeling is that it maybe as much her fault as the sergeants. I'm already guarding myself against that and feeling that responsibility for being her senior and the responsibility for reinforcing that chain of command and her responsibility to make it work, to make that sergeant responsive to her. 

00:10:10
 Did you have some ideas about how you should handle that situation at that time? 

00:10:15
MAJOR WHITE Ah, right of top of my head, I did. Ah, because I'd, haven't had that problem recently and I, it was a temptation to begin by saying, "Well, haven't you done this?" But I realized that I didn't really know as much about it ah, as she did. In addition, I, I had the feeling that ah, she was really looking for some help and ah, she probably already heard that kind of an answer, she ought to be tougher telling me so or something like that. 

00:10:45
 Did you have any ideas about what you should be doing in that situation? 

00:10:50
MAJOR WHITE As the one she was seeking out for help? 

00:10:50
 Yeah. 

00:10:50
MAJOR WHITE  You know, I'd, I really felt my role is to listen to her and, and key on what she really thought were her problems rather than perhaps what she said they were. 

00:11:05
 Major White, what kind of a job do you think you were doing, do you think you were been the kind of listener you wanted to be at that time? 

00:11:10
MAJOR WHITE I think that I've, I think that I had some prejudices that were already filtering what I heard. But I'm not, I don't think Captain Rhone perceived that, at that point. I had those well enough ah, under control so that I was still a pretty often sounding board to her. 

00:11:25
  Okay. Were there any other feelings or thoughts that were, you aware of at this point? 

00:11:35
MAJOR WHITE No, I don't think so, sir. 

00:11:35
MAJOR WHITE What(ph) you know, for instance? 

00:11:35
CAPTAIN RHONE  Ah, for instance, ah, I might say I need this by 11 o'clock and, ah, go back and check 11 o'clock and well, it's written to his schedule for 1:30 that afternoon. 

00:11:50
MAJOR WHITE I mean, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:11:50
CAPTAIN RHONE It is one example, ah. 

00:11:50
MAJOR WHITE A really specific thing that you've told him to do, he is failed to do? 

00:11:55
CAPTAIN RHONE Uh hmm. I've ask him to get it, get me, check that kind of information... (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
MAJOR WHITE Hmm(ph). 

00:12:00
CAPTAIN RHONE ...by time when I needed it. (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
MAJOR WHITE How do you feel about that? 

00:12:00
CAPTAIN RHONE  Ah, frustrates me. Uhm, I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, I don't know if I should be... (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
 She's. 

00:12:10
CAPTAIN RHONE ...should be dealing with him differently. 

00:12:10
MAJOR WHITE Do you think he knows that? 

00:12:10
MAJOR WHITE Right, right there I used that phrase, "How do you feel about that?" And I've got natural hang up for that phrase and, and, and normally don't like it when people ask me, how do you feel about that? You know, I use that as kind of a reflex 'coz I've, I really know what else to say and I got pretty response out of it. But there is obviously some feeling there, ah, when she started to tell me what her sergeant had done and, ah, there, there's a, there's some feeling at this point that I've detected that as going on with Captain Rhone and that sergeant, that's really, ah, in addition to any problem about, the sergeant failing to do his duty. 

00:12:55
  And what feeling were you detecting on the part of Captain Rhone at this time? 

00:13:00
MAJOR WHITE I think that she kind of felt like she's got stuck. I'm not sure why? But I have the perception that, she feels that she's getting more of her share that somehow, either the fact that she is a woman has complicated it for her or that she has to prove herself or that, in some way she is getting a ration that she has not necessarily deserved. 

00:13:30
 Did you were able to detect that or leave that feeling was held on the capt, part of Captain Rhone. What impact do that have on your behavior, do you believe at that time? 

00:13:40
MAJOR WHITE Well, I think that, ah, reinforce in me the role that I had to listen with the more than just what she was saying because I think there was more involve at this point. And she had just finish narrating a specific instance or a failure to obtain certain information by specifying time. But, ah, there seem to be more than that involve in, ah, a lot of that center around Captain Rhone's feelings. So I've begin to be more up tune(ph) to her feelings rather than simply the specifics of the situation that she was going to narrate. 

00:14:20
  Do you believe she was picking up on your feelings, she was aware of your feelings at that time? 

00:14:25
MAJOR WHITE I don't think so. Ah, I don't think I was showing many, I had some ah, but I was not, ah, not letting them out. 

00:14:35
  Could you be a little bit clear with me, help me understand what some of those feelings might have been... (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
MAJOR WHITE Well, (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
 ...at that time? 

00:14:45
MAJOR WHITE I've, you know, I have that, I think natural frustration to wanted to solve the problem now. And being competent(ph) my own ability to do that. Ah, but knowing that it was Captain Rhone's responsibility to solve this problem I was hesitant to prescribe to her what her actions should be really kind of hopeful in the school solution I hope that we would get there together and it would be hers. Ah, no I was unwilling to complicate the issue either with my solutions or ah, personal reactions to the situation that she had does far narrated. 

00:15:20
MAJOR WHITE  What kind of feedback did you get from him? 

00:15:25
CAPTAIN RHONE  Things get in the way, I didn't understand, that wasn't clear to me. Ah, You have to understand ma'am that I've got certain priorities too. 

00:15:35
MAJOR WHITE Would, do you have any idea of, about, ah, why he is doing that? Is there some indication that, ah, do you have a feeling for what's the cause of the problem, 'coz your a woman? 

00:15:50
CAPTAIN RHONE Uhm, I don't know that specifically is, because I'm a wom, I'm a woman, I, I've wondered about that I've, ah, question has raises something in my mind? Ah. 

00:16:00
 Well? 

00:16:00
MAJOR WHITE  Right there, are, I've missed one, ah, I, I kind a lot of go by and come back where, ah, she said that she felt, she discuss it, you know, obviously that have, be frustrating experience for and to me, it sound like a one-sided discussion. Ah, she was pretty able to narrate quickly the sequence of excuses that, that sergeant had been through without hearing the other side of story from the sergeant which at this point I'm not really sure, well, whether I'll have an opportunity to do so. And I would anticipate not since it's not going to be my problem. That she, she's fed up, I, she wants some help about what to do, she really wants a specific answer for me of how to correct it. And I'm about ready to give her one but trying not to. 

00:16:55
 Uh hmm. What do you think might happen at this point if in fact you go ahead and, and have follow through and given her specific answer? 

00:17:05
MAJOR WHITE I think she will said, "Thank you, sir," and left. Ah, I wasn't(ph) prepared a lot to do that yet. In fairness to the sergeant McNeals(ph) I've not completely convince, it might not be somewhere her fault ah, for allowing that particular sergeant to get away with what he is doing. Ah, I wouldn't want for her to leave yet, ah, and again, I've, in the schooling process that we been through to develop some of these skills, solving the problem for is not a long term solution. 

00:17:35
  So what are you feeling in the situation where Captain Rhone is asking... (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
MAJOR WHITE Uh hmm. 

00:17:40
  you for a solution and you're... (crosstalk) 

00:17:45
MAJOR WHITE I've, (crosstalk) 

00:17:45
 ...resisting that? (crosstalk) 

00:17:45
MAJOR WHITE I'm feeling the same frustration ah, with my inability to solve it right now. And having to exercise the patience and the restraint to be non-prescriptive. I don't know if she's perceive that or not. Initially, I was perhaps ah, somewhat apprehensive about my own ability to interact with a woman officer. Ah, but if what she has said about this particular sergeant, ah, is half true. Ah, she and I are on the same side and don't have a problem in that regard at all. 

00:18:25
 Do you feel those feelings are working for the communication process now or, ah. 

00:18:35
MAJOR WHITE I don't know, sir, ah, if she perceives, we're on the same side. I think there's an element of the rank and the fact that we don't work together on the day-to-day basis and the fact that I am normally very reserved that ah, she may have troubled detecting that empathy. 

00:18:50
  What do you imagine that Captain Rhone is feeling about you at this time? 

00:18:55
MAJOR WHITE  Well, I, I'm not sure about what she doesn't have say, at some of the same apprehension about me and my understanding that she's already experienced with that sergeant. 

00:19:05
  Are there any other feelings that you aware of, at that point? 

00:19:10
MAJOR WHITE  Not right now, I, that, I'm still struggling with that patience(ph) not to be directive. That's hard for me. 

00:19:20
 Can you tell me a little bit more about what the patience or lack of patience at that point, you're struggle with your patience seems to be doing that on your interaction, your feelings at that point. 

00:19:30
MAJOR WHITE Well, I would like to provide the solution and I could, and the, to not be able to do that is frustrating. That, that's frustrating for me. I'm use to solving the situation now. So it's a, it's a little out of character. 

00:19:50
  And why didn't you do it? Why didn't you solve the problem. 

00:19:55
MAJOR WHITE Because I would have solved it and Captain Rhone wouldn't have. And tomorrow, she'll have the same problem, if not with the same sergeant, ah, with that sergeant when I leave. (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
  Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
MAJOR WHITE And, ah, she is the one who has to develop that talent and that no nonsense approach that(ph) ensures that sergeant to do what captain's tell him to. 

00:20:20
CAPTAIN RHONE This. (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
MAJOR WHITE So how do you deal with that anger? 

00:20:20
CAPTAIN RHONE  Not very well, uhm, one of the things that I don't wanna do is to bind to the kinds of things that, that he may tagged me with so I, I typically don't say trying to, to display that anger toward him. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
MAJOR WHITE So you're saying your angry... (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
CAPTAIN RHONE Uh hmm. 

00:20:40
MAJOR WHITE ...but that you really don't want him to know about it? 

00:20:45
CAPTAIN RHONE Well, I wanna be able to deal with him effectively, I don't want hi, to give him any ammunition to say, "See that really proves that you are incompetent, you can't deal with anger. 

00:20:55
MAJOR WHITE Do you feel he thinks you're incompetent? 

00:21:00
CAPTAIN RHONE Yes, I do. In some of the things that I do, yes. 

00:21:00
MAJOR WHITE  But the way you describe it, it would seem that he is the incompetent. Or at least not doing his job. Do you feel he understands his job? 

00:21:15
CAPTAIN RHONE That's a good question, ah, he says he does. 

00:21:20
MAJOR WHITE Now, here sir, I've, I, I got a purpose in this line of question. I wanted to know, I knew she was angry, with the sergeant's performance. It's been my experience that, ah, normally, ah, if confronted, a sergeant will do his job, there are so many levers and, ah, ways to influence the performance of subordinates that, ah, I thought that's why we have a range(ph) instructor so if that happens. And if Captain Rhone were frustrated and angry with the performance that she had received on the behalf of this subordinate and she were angry about it then he ought to know about that. Ah, if she is rating his performance and has a responsibility in his promotion, in advancement, in assignment then he needs to know when she is displeased with his performance. And I wasn't sure whether he knew that whether she had provided that feedback for him, she'd said she had talk with him but I already have a feel of how effective that conversation had been. And then I kinda want to know if, if she laid the law down about what this particular individuals responsibility is worth to her. And I kinda got the feeling that maybe she hadn't done that. And well, at the beginning I would have solve this by saying myself I might as just argue, you haven't done your job and you'd better, but(ph) she can't say that until they have established the ground in which they both understand what the criteria performance is. So, I've had to revised my estimate a little bit about the solution to a chating she ought to get and that, that line of question was pretty helpful to me in identifying what she had done already to solve the problem. I'm not sure she laid the basic time(ph) work in doing that yet. 

00:23:25
 As you identify some foundation of (inaudible ) that hadn't been laid, I'm wondering what your feelings are in this interaction? 

00:23:30
MAJOR WHITE Well, I'd, I kinda felt that that is something that she should have already done. And I have the inquiries why she hasn't maybe that something nobody ever told her, taught her or something she never learned. Then that becomes you know, something that perhaps I can, I can teach. And she can understand that before you can demand performance at(ph) the people who have to perform have to understand what's expected. 

00:24:05
  Okay, so you want to be able to help relay the foundation at this point in the interaction? 

00:24:15
MAJOR WHITE Yes, sir. 

00:24:15
CAPTAIN RHONE  I don't know. 

00:24:20
MAJOR WHITE Well, do you feel that you understand what he should be doing? 

00:24:25
CAPTAIN RHONE Yes. 

00:24:25
MAJOR WHITE Would it be possible for the two of you to talk about that in specific terms or perhaps have it? 

00:24:30
CAPTAIN RHONE  I feel that we have. The, the thing that seems to work with him saying, "Okay, now, you've done this. Now, let's do step two. And okay, good, that's good on step two. Now, let's do step three," but that in and of itself is, is too time consuming in, ah, that's what we know that, takes less time to do it myself than to ask him to do it for me and to have to monitor, supervise in that fashion. 

00:24:55
MAJOR WHITE Oh, how is that impact on the rest of the things that you have to do? 

00:25:00
CAPTAIN RHONE Uhm, they get done later. 

00:25:00
MAJOR WHITE  So you doing his job for him? 

00:25:05
CAPTAIN RHONE  I don't know. 

00:25:10
MAJOR WHITE Well, it's seems to me that if he is working for you... (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
CAPTAIN RHONE Uh hmm. 

00:25:15
MAJOR WHITE ...ah, he should do just that. 

00:25:15
CAPTAIN RHONE Yes, so what I'm, what I'm looking for help on is, how do I, how do I get that change, how do I did it to be differently... (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
MAJOR WHITE Well, what would you, (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
CAPTAIN RHONE ...to be different. 

00:25:25
MAJOR WHITE what would you think the next step, might be? 

00:25:25
CAPTAIN RHONE Sir, I don't know. I, I really, you know. 

00:25:30
MAJOR WHITE Right there, she ask me to do it for and the, and I've, I got to the point I wouldn't even, I didn't even almost take it. She, she wanted the answer and I almost let her up to it with the discussion than the fact that she got two and three and kinda has three(ph) of maybe she wasn't doing his job for him and as a result being less able to do her own job and she, she almost ask me, "Give me the answer." Well, she did, ah, and I tried to get her on past that what, what's the next step in, ah, I want(ph) this tempted(ph) this time to solve it for her. I really think I have much better handle on the problem ah, at this point and the fact that, she's done the initial step of talking and I feel more confident that I'm on the right track now. And you know, and honestly I'm really more comfortable in the situation with the fact that were talking about a problem that I understand and I, a little consider it to be a, a female ah, problem. 

00:26:40
Captain's Recall 

00:26:40
CAPTAIN RHONE  After entrapped(ph) there I was, uhm, feeling that, gee, that you know, when I came to, to talk to ah, Major Robert(ph) there were a lot of things on my mind and now, I'll said well, he says for instance, going, what are they inter, are they really, uhm, are they really important, was it (inaudible ) is it really important? 

00:27:12
  What impacted(ph) those feelings having on your, ah, communication at that time with Major White? 

00:27:20
CAPTAIN RHONE Uhm, I wondering why I'm there for one thing, I wonder what, what is he gee(ph), what he is gonna be thinking about me if I, you know, he saying what are the things and uhm, is he gonna say those are nothing. So I'm, I'm always sudden saying(ph) I'm aware that I'm worried, ah, about what he's gonna think when I left(ph) for him, here are the difficulties I'm having. 

00:27:40
  Some ideas about how you gonna handle that if in case it does come up? 

00:27:45
CAPTAIN RHONE  No, not right now. Just hope I can get through it. 

00:27:50
  Anything else? 

00:27:55
CAPTAIN RHONE No. 

00:27:55
CAPTAIN RHONE  Right there, uhm, I was were to say and I should ins, and, and think to myself there's gotta be something that, that you ought to know how to do that's just not working. 

00:28:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:28:10
CAPTAIN RHONE And, and aware that, that's have an impact on me, uhm, again, in my mind, "Gee, what's, what's with me, what's going on?" Uhm. 

00:28:20
 What are you feeling at this point? 

00:28:20
CAPTAIN RHONE Pretty incompetent, ah, with, in my inability to deal with the person who I feel like I should be able to deal with. 

00:28:30
[sil.] 

00:28:30
  What do you think Major White's thinking of you at this time? 

00:28:40
CAPTAIN RHONE Uhm, I don't know I think I'm afraid that he's saying that his voice are saying that voice that, that keeps cycle in my head you, you should know how to handle it. 

00:28:50
  Do you think he's able to sense how you feel at this point? 

00:28:55
CAPTAIN RHONE  I don't know. Right there, (sigh) I was unsure what was happening I know that, that the thought has raises something in my mind, is this happening to me 'coz I'm a woman. Ah, and I didn't know if, uhm, if he was grab (inaudible ) if he really knew something. I didn't know how deal with it at that time. With, with the question of you, you know, I wa, I was unsure as to whether or not it was okay to say sometimes I think it maybe. 

00:29:25
 And maybe that you're a woman? (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
CAPTAIN RHONE That, that I'm a woman. 

00:29:30
 Did you have some ideas about what ah, Major White was thinking at this point? 

00:29:35
CAPTAIN RHONE  That, that, that, that might, that the fact that I am a woman might be a reason for me to have difficulty with dealing with the sergeant and if that was true that somebody won't hear it. 

00:29:50
 You have any fantasies or ideas about how it was gonna work out from, the interview is gonna work out at this point? 

00:29:55
CAPTAIN RHONE (sighs) I know that, uhm, I wanted some help and I was afraid that I was, I, it wo, I was afraid that one time and I was gonna be told that I, I should know what was gonna go on. Ah. 

00:30:15
[sil.] 

00:30:15
  Well, at this point in the film did you think that you are gonna, going to be getting some help or... (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
CAPTAIN RHONE Hmm. 

00:30:20
 ...what was, what were you feeling at this point? 

00:30:25
CAPTAIN RHONE I felt that he was trying to help me figure out what was going on and tell me, help(ph) me explore some ah, possibilities of wa, why this was happening to me. Why, I was having difficulty in that(ph) sergeant. I don't think I wanted to hear it was possibly because I was a woman. Well, fears and fantasies about that, about, uhm, wondering, what is he going, you know, what he is thinking, particularly with the whole idea of, of a, here I am looking for help and what is that mean. You know, is that really a statement about me. 

00:30:55
  Uhm. Do you think Major White is aware of those feelings going on at you at this point? 

00:31:05
CAPTAIN RHONE No. I think Major White knows that I'm, I'm asking for help. (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
CAPTAIN RHONE And I have really concern, but I'd, uhm. No, I wouldn't think that he would know that, ah, I'm concerned about what he thinks about me and that I'm afraid that he may, in fact, knew me as not a good officer. 

00:31:25
 Okay. That's good. 

00:31:30
CAPTAIN RHONE  I think that was really the answer for me. Uhm, I don't want him to say that you can't deal with anger. I think, he's probably, may speak to me more than it's me speaking. 

00:31:45
  And if you heard that voice very clearly, what would that statement be? The voice(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
CAPTAIN RHONE  The voice is very clearly saying, I wanted, ah, you don't deal with anger. You don't, people see that you don't. 

00:32:00
 I don't deal with anger and I don't want people to see that. What impacts that having on you and your communication here with Major White? 

00:32:10
CAPTAIN RHONE  I don't know. Uhm, I suspect, as I made the statement as a true statement, uhm, about being a sergeant. I suspect it's also more true statement about myself. (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
 Yeah. 

00:32:30
CAPTAIN RHONE He got me. Ah. (crosstalk) 

00:32:30
 How (inaudible )? 

00:32:35
CAPTAIN RHONE He asked me a question that, that was, ah, that I, as I realized, he was asking I really said that, that was, that the only answer I have for him was I don't deal with it, that I don't deal with anger. Uhm, and for me, the smile is a give away. 

00:32:50
 What did it mean for you? (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
CAPTAIN RHONE I mean just like that. 

00:32:50
  Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
CAPTAIN RHONE I don't think he, ah, and it's not the idea of Major White that catched me. It's ah, he, he asked you a question and, and, (sigh) the honest response is I don't deal with anger and that is being filtered here. 

00:33:05
 How do you feel at that point? 

00:33:05
CAPTAIN RHONE  Like I wish, I could say, "Here's the way I deal with anger." 

00:33:10
 And. (crosstalk) 

00:33:10
CAPTAIN RHONE  And again, I feel, ah, referral(ph) to be an answer. You know, I, I'm feeling pretty incompetent and inadequate as I, as I have, as I feel like I had to say to him, I don't. 

00:33:25
 Any ideas about what ah, Major White's thinking of you at this point, and the. 

00:33:35
[sil.] 

00:33:35
CAPTAIN RHONE  I have no reason to believe that he's thinking bad things about me. Uhm, I would, ah, I would had to say that I think, he thinks I'm okay. 

00:33:50
 Are the feelings, ah. 

00:33:55
[sil.] 

00:33:55
CAPTAIN RHONE  Uhm, being on myself again. 

00:34:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:34:00
Interview: Captain and Major 

00:34:00
MAJOR WHITE  Captain Rhone, it's been a couple of days now, since we've last talked in regard, the, the problem you've been having with the Staff Sergeant who works for you. We have both been through a recall session with Colonel Wilson(ph), which I personally found very profitable(ph). Ah, how did you find that session? 

00:34:30
CAPTAIN RHONE Ah, I realized that, ah, I have a lot of concerns when I came to talk to you. Ah, about the way you were gonna perceive me and it was, ah, it was clear to me that, that after the session was over, that I didn't know how you felt. I felt bad about the, having come and say, I don't know how to deal with this issue. Ah, I felt pretty inadequate and I was, I was really very concerned about what your reaction to that was gonna be. 

00:34:55
MAJOR WHITE Well, how do you feel about that now? 

00:34:55
CAPTAIN RHONE  Uhm, one of the things that I wanted to hear and I guess, I probably, still want to hear, is that it's okay, for that way and I really wanted some assurance from you, you know, that it was okay that I don't know what to do. 

00:35:10
MAJOR WHITE Right, I really feel it. Probably, there's something wrong with, if you weren't somewhat apprehensive about coming to see me, for that particular problem. 

00:35:20
CAPTAIN RHONE Uh hmm. 

00:35:20
MAJOR WHITE And it's really my intent, ah, figure out what the problem is and, and perhaps together we can explore them, and maybe solve it. Ah, I remember that, ah, in the last session, we had talked primarily and identified the problem with this particular sergeant, we have talked about you and he in an understanding of whether or not he knew what you're expecting of it. Do you have the feeling that he understands what you want from him. 

00:35:50
CAPTAIN RHONE  Yes, sir. I think he does. 

00:35:55
MAJOR WHITE Well, is it also, you're feeling that he's deliberately frustrating you? 

00:36:00
CAPTAIN RHONE  Well, I'm, I'm certainly being frustrated. Ah, uhm, (sigh) I hate to, you know, attribute to him that motive, uhm, thought that cross my mind. I've wondered about that. 

00:36:20
MAJOR WHITE Tell me, who's the staff sergeant. 

00:36:20
CAPTAIN RHONE Yes, sir. 

00:36:20
MAJOR WHITE Where he fails to salute a captain. 

00:36:20
CAPTAIN RHONE  At times. 

00:36:25
MAJOR WHITE Does that track is being normal to you? 

00:36:25
CAPTAIN RHONE  No, no, sir. It doesn't. 

00:36:30
MAJOR WHITE Well, ah, what do you feel I should do, if that were to happen to me? 

00:36:40
CAPTAIN RHONE  Ma, my only answer that is, is that, ah, you should do wha, what's right for you and, and I think part of my struggle is not being sure what's right. Uhm, have a lot of, a lot of feelings about different ways to handle that and it occurs to me that there's a way, that I would like to handle, was, maybe different than the way the military would tell me, I should handled it. 

00:37:00
MAJOR WHITE What would you expect the military to tell you? 

00:37:05
CAPTAIN RHONE Go, get him, grab him and set him straight right then. 

00:37:10
MAJOR WHITE What is there about that it, you find uncomfortable? 

00:37:10
CAPTAIN RHONE  Uhm, ah, I think I can do it. Uhm, if I were pressed, if I were told to do and I would do it. I, I probably would feel very com, comfortable doing it. 

00:37:25
Mutual Recall Session: Captain and Major 

00:37:25
MAJOR WHITE  Captain Rhone, it's been a couple of days now, since we've last talked in regard the, the problem you've having with the Staff Sergeant, who works for you. We have both been through a recall session with Colonel Wilson(ph) which I have personally found very profitable. How did you find that session? 

00:37:55
CAPTAIN RHONE Ah, I realized that, ah, I had a lot of concerns when I came in to talk to you, ah, about the way you're gonna perceive me and it was, ah, it was clear to me that, that after the session it was over, that I didn't know, how you felt. I felt bad about the, having come and say, I don't know how to deal with this issue. Ah, I felt pretty inadequate and I was, I was really very concerned about what your reaction to that was gonna be. 

00:38:20
MAJOR WHITE  Well, how do you feel about that now? 

00:38:25
CAPTAIN RHONE Uhm, one of the things that I wanted to hear and I guess. 

00:38:25
CAPTAIN RHONE  And that was not an easy thing for me to say and I felt like I was doing it all over again. And I was really laying myself open. Uhm, I suspect, because it's not a normal thing to do, to come and then say, "Gee, I felt inadequate." "Gee, I was afraid." 

00:38:45
MAJOR WHITE Well, there are lot of people who do that. You know, it's not that abnormal. 

00:38:50
CAPTAIN RHONE  And I agree with that. It, it's should, it, it felt scary to me. 

00:38:55
MAJOR WHITE What could I've done, in that instance, ah, to have put you more at ease, without in anyway sacrificing what you and I as a captain and a major have between us? 

00:39:10
CAPTAIN RHONE Perhaps you address it, straight on. 

00:39:10
MAJOR WHITE  Okay. 

00:39:15
 Shall we go on. 

00:39:15
MAJOR WHITE Sure. 

00:39:15
CAPTAIN RHONE  Is that I wanted to hear and I guess, I probably, still want to hear. Is that, it's okay, you feel that way ah, I really wanted some assurance from you, and that it was okay that I don't know what to do. 

00:39:30
MAJOR WHITE Right, I really feel it. Probably, there's something wrong with, if you weren't someone apprehensive about coming to see me for that particular problem. 

00:39:35
CAPTAIN RHONE  Uh hmm. 

00:39:40
MAJOR WHITE And it's really my intent, ah, to figure out what the problem is and, and perhaps together we. 

00:39:45
CAPTAIN RHONE I don't know what that meant, when, ah, Major White said you, you know, you should have felt about coming to me with that problem. I'd, I really didn't know what you, what. (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
MAJOR WHITE I felt like I was doing exactly what you were asking for, that you wanted some assurance, that you were not and the only person to come and see me for some advice. 

00:40:05
CAPTAIN RHONE And something about the way that came across felt bad to me. Uhm, you, I think what I heard was you ought to feel bad if you have to come talk to me about this. 

00:40:10
MAJOR WHITE Hmm, that just it, opposite what I meant to say. 

00:40:15
 Captain Rhone, how are you feeling at that time? 

00:40:15
CAPTAIN RHONE Pretty bad. Again, feeling like, "Okay. Here I am. I've said it, ah, let's see what's gonna happen and, and what happened was we went back to the problem, instead of talking about, "Here's how I feel." Uhm, we've, weren't right back and said, "Okay. Let's see, if we come up with a, a solution to the problem." And at that, at, at this moment, that problem for me is not, I don't know how to deal with a sergeant. The problem is, I don't have to deal with you right now. I'm, (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
MAJOR WHITE I cannot. (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
CAPTAIN RHONE I'm having some feelings about that. 

00:40:45
MAJOR WHITE And I'm more concern about, ah, Captain Rhone dealing with the problem and I am what you're dealing with me. I really have to orient it. My intent is going in and back on the problem. Ah, I guess, in the way there is our interaction and that, ah, we can't begin to do that until we have dealt with our interaction but I, very intentionally was dealing with the problem and, ah, attempting to get you to orient back on that. And I think, I go all over further to summarize the problem and ah, trying to determine where we were the last time. I would try, I guess is, it is still kind a painful for you. 

00:41:25
CAPTAIN RHONE Uhm, the message to me was, "Okay. You have some concerns, you ought to feel bad. We're not gonna talk about it, let's go back and see whether or not, you've come up with the resolution yet to the sergeant issue." And I'm kinda, left their feeling, (chuckles), we really can't. We really, it's really not okay to say I'm concerned. 

00:41:40
MAJOR WHITE  Ah, we have talked about, you and he and an understanding of whether or not he knew what you're expecting of it. 

00:41:50
MAJOR WHITE  I was trying to go the base for further discussion on what we had already done rather than repeating... (crosstalk) 

00:42:00
CAPTAIN RHONE Okay. 

00:42:00
MAJOR WHITE ...what we've already done. 

00:42:05
CAPTAIN RHONE As I look at it, again, I'm, I'm begin to feel a little scared. I'm gonna be ask for, for the right answer and I'm, I'm not gonna have it. 

00:42:10
  All right. I can understand that because (chuckles) that's very honestly exactly where I'm leading. Ah, I've, I'm, my goal in this second session, you know, maybe it'll take longer than two times around is to have Captain Rhone ah, express a tentative solution and then to ask her any how, she's gonna approach that and hopefully, let it go out and cry. 

00:42:40
CAPTAIN RHONE And I think, right now, my anxieties is not so much over the thought of confronting the sergeant. It's more of a thought of being confronted with coming up with an answer. 

00:42:45
  Okay. 

00:42:50
CAPTAIN RHONE Okay. 

00:42:50
 Nothing yet? 

00:42:50
MAJOR WHITE No, sir. 

00:42:50
MAJOR WHITE  What do you want from him? 

00:42:55
CAPTAIN RHONE  Yes, sir. I think he does. 

00:43:00
MAJOR WHITE Well, is it also, you're feeling that he is deliberately frustrating you? 

00:43:05
CAPTAIN RHONE  Well, I'm, I'm certainly, being frustrated. Ah, uhm. (sigh) I hate to, you know, attribute to him that motive, uhm, that(ph) thought has cross my mind. I've wondered about that. 

00:43:20
MAJOR WHITE  Tell me, who's the... 

00:43:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:43:25
CAPTAIN RHONE I really felt put on the spot there, ah, because I really have wondered is this person deliberately doing it to me and, ah, I really didn't wanna have to, to sit and say, "Yes, I think he is." Ah, I really felt, on the spot there to, to make a declaration... (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:43:40
CAPTAIN RHONE ...that I was uncomfortable makin' it. 

00:43:40
  Uh hmm. 

00:43:45
MAJOR WHITE I think, I knew you're on the spot but then, and I don't think I was uncomfortable having you on that spot, either, ah, I almost kinda felt like that had to be inevitable, what you thought there was something that he had in for you. What you'd narrated in the previous session is just and it's incredible to me, ah, that someone who has achieved that rank in the army would probably get away with or what to do to a captain. And then, I knew that, ah, at least, you had a very strong feeling that that ah, must have be in your perception and I, I think, I really want you to say, yes, and I can say, "well, I can understand that," because I saw that as a point where we might have rally together a little bit. I don't think we got there on it, I don't know. You're, you're heavy sigh was, was an indication to me that I might have hit home a little bit. 

00:44:40
CAPTAIN RHONE Yeah. And I'm beginning to feel right now that, ah, perhaps one of Major Rush(ph)'s goal is to keep me on the spot. One of his goals is to keep me there on the spot, and that's really not where I wanna be. I've, I'm already on the spot, feeling like I'm coming here to say help me out and ah, that I'm asking for help for what I'm being told is back, you know, get back on there and, and, ah, it's frustrating to me. 

00:45:00
 What's the feeling like you, to you to be on that spot. 

00:45:05
CAPTAIN RHONE Uhm, I think very much like it, it feels when I'm, when I'm with the sergeant, like I don't know what the right answer is and I've gotta go out and, and, and find it and, and being on the spot is terribly uncomfortable. Ah, I know there's got to be an answer. I know, I don't know it and I feel like I've said, "Please help me find it," and the response I'm getting is what, "Get back over there and, and, and hurt a bit more and it'll come to you... (crosstalk) 

00:45:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:45:30
CAPTAIN RHONE ...anytime. 

00:45:30
 Okay. Any fears or ideas about what's gonna happen. The worst thing that could've happen in this situation? 

00:45:35
CAPTAIN RHONE  Is that I won't know the right answer. 

00:45:40
MAJOR WHITE I had the feeling that the worst thing that I could say at that point was, "Look Captain, this is your problem and you need to address it up front, ah, now for not anymore fooling around." Ah, go back and require that sergeant to do what you ask him to do. What a non-commissioned officer of, of his rank ought to do and I could've said that but I didn't want to. Ah, and I really felt that if I had said that, I would have gotten, "Yes, sir. Good morning." and that would have been it and I don't feel I really would have taught Captain Rhone anything. The problem is hers. She is on the spot and there's not, I can't take her off that spot with this particular sergeant. The perception is little bit like she'll won't talked about that sergeant. 

00:46:35
CAPTAIN RHONE My feeling right now, is, it's, it, I know I'm on the spot with the sergeant but I feel like I'm now being forced to be on the spot with you! Uhm, and I don't understand why that's like that. (crosstalk) 

00:46:45
MAJOR WHITE I, I have a prop, I have a feeling that I might be doing it. Ah, and then, all honestly, I'm, I don't know that I was uncomfortable with that but perhaps I could have taken on more, ah, ah, I'm in pathetic role but I'm not sure I would've been comfortable with that. I had the apprehension that I would be solving your problem for you. 

00:47:05
  What would happen if you solve Captain Rhone's problem at this point? 

00:47:15
MAJOR WHITE Well, I've, we would have a great fix to the problem, perhaps but, ah, not a problem or not a solution to the fact that Captain Rhone in her career, will have other sergeants in other places. Ah, in it's, it's part of the fact that the, she is a captain in the army and, and paid for her, assuming those responsibilities that she must do, those unit discipline task herself. 

00:47:40
CAPTAIN RHONE And I think it's pretty warm feeling that is because that message comes across very clear right now and the message comes across all of the time out there and not knowing what the right answer is. As it, it just a very frustrating for me. 

00:47:50
MAJOR WHITE  Could we go ahead and see if we got away from that along in the, in the tape. 

00:47:55
 Sure. 

00:47:55
MAJOR WHITE  Tell me who's the staff sergeant? 

00:48:00
CAPTAIN RHONE Yes, sir. 

00:48:00
MAJOR WHITE Where he fails to salute a captain. 

00:48:05
CAPTAIN RHONE At times. 

00:48:05
MAJOR WHITE Does that track is being normal to you? 

00:48:05
CAPTAIN RHONE  No, no, sir. It doesn't. 

00:48:10
MAJOR WHITE Well, ah, what do you feel, I should do, if that were to happen to me? 

00:48:20
CAPTAIN RHONE  Ma, my only answer to that is, is that, ah, you should do right, what's right for you and ah. (crosstalk) 

00:48:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:48:30
MAJOR WHITE I'd, I really want you to have, I'm trying so hard to get you to suggest a solution, any solution that I try to reverse the roles on you, but you wouldn't do it. Ah, did you see at that point that you could've told me what to do or were you still apprehensive about, ah, giving me the wrong answer. 

00:48:50
CAPTAIN RHONE Yes, I was. I still am. (laughs) 

00:48:50
MAJOR WHITE  All right. Okay. 

00:48:55
CAPTAIN RHONE  I, uhm, I still think I don't know what to, what the, I feel like there has got to be an answer and I know that that's not necessarily true. 

00:49:10
MAJOR WHITE  Well, I agree. 

00:49:15
CAPTAIN RHONE And I think as I, you know, as I, perhaps one of the things I maybe doing is struggling to come up with the perfect answer and because of that I can't see any answers. And truthfully I know it's better to go out and try something and say, "Okay. that didn't work." You know, ah, now, I try to be, "Okay. that didn't work either." You know, and perhaps see your work and, and right now, I just feels like that, ah, that I know the, the answer is there somewhere. But I've got, I've got to get it the first time. 

00:49:45
MAJOR WHITE In this instance, you threw it right back at him, here you go Major, the ball is yours one more time. Can we go ahead, sir, and I just point. (crosstalk) 

00:49:55
 Ah, I'd like to know ah, (crosstalk) 

00:49:55
MAJOR WHITE Okay. 

00:49:55
 Captain Rhone, what you wanted to happen at that point? What did you want to Major White to do? 

00:50:00
CAPTAIN RHONE  I think perhaps I wanted him to, if there was answer coming, ah, it might have been nice to hear and say, "Let's talk about some alternatives." Ah, it's clear to me now that we're not, I'm talking about the way I feel, we're gonna come up with an answer to this sergeant. (crosstalk) 

00:50:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:50:15
CAPTAIN RHONE  Ah, that's beginning to frustrate me, that's, that's been frustrating to me and I think now, I'm ready for him to say, "Okay. Let's, let's talk about some options." 

00:50:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:50:25
CAPTAIN RHONE Uhm, instead of saying, you know, as you throw it back to me and say, "What might I do, ah, I feel like we've, we've been over that. I don't know what that answer is." And I guess, perhaps, you know, I'm ready to say, "Okay. Here some possibilities, let's talk about them. Let's see if there's any have a minute you maybe comfortable with, uhm, any of, that you willing to try. 

00:50:45
  Okay, we've had a chance to review and take a look at some of the feelings you had as we are making this, ah, ah, tape, what I'd like to do is, is just leave now and let you continue with the interaction that you've had, ah, and see where that leads(ph). 

00:51:00
CAPTAIN RHONE Okay. 

00:51:00
Post Recall Session: Captain and Major 

00:51:00
CAPTAIN RHONE  Uh hmm. 

00:51:15
MAJOR WHITE And the last thing we talk about was, was options. I think it might be useful if we were to identify some and then, and try to find the one that best fits your style within your environment. Also top of my head, I would suggest, ah, there's the direct confrontation. Ah, there maybe the fact that that sergeant expects that from you as a captain, I don't know, you know. Ah, there's the issue of the other people in your office, who have the same opportunity to correct, and except your behavior. There has to have be something that's gonna happen ah, that identifies to that sergeant that his behavior was unexceptable today. You know, you know, I'm better than I do. 

00:52:10
CAPTAIN RHONE Yes, sir. 

00:52:10
MAJOR WHITE What would be the quickiest way of doing it? 

00:52:15
CAPTAIN RHONE  Perhaps to say, "Okay. Now, enough of this foolishness, let just get down to business let's play out the way it's gonna be and here's what's gonna happen if things went this way." Do you understand? 

00:52:30
MAJOR WHITE Uh hmm. 

00:52:30
CAPTAIN RHONE And have a, (clear throat) have it very clearly to find, for him, what the task is and what the penalty for not achieving that task is. As well as, you know, what happens when you do. 

00:52:45
MAJOR WHITE Now, what are the difficulties for you, in that kind of a solution? 

00:52:50
CAPTAIN RHONE  I think, for me, the difficulty is, ah, when the things don't, ah, I can laid out. And when things don't go well knowing just exactly what's okay to do. Uhm, I can laid out for him and I have done that before. It does, it doesn't take, it doesn't last very long. 

00:53:10
MAJOR WHITE So the problem is that, ah, he pushes you again. 

00:53:15
CAPTAIN RHONE Uh hmm. 

00:53:15
MAJOR WHITE Does he push you? (crosstalk) 

00:53:15
CAPTAIN RHONE Yes. 

00:53:15
MAJOR WHITE You feel pushed? 

00:53:15
CAPTAIN RHONE Yes, sir. I feel manipulated. 

00:53:20
MAJOR WHITE  By the sergeant? 

00:53:25
CAPTAIN RHONE Uh hmm. 

00:53:25
MAJOR WHITE You think he know what he's doing? 

00:53:25
CAPTAIN RHONE  Okay. Earlier I, I, I was not really mention that... (crosstalk) 

00:53:30
MAJOR WHITE Yeah. I, I has said the question before. (crosstalk) 

00:53:30
CAPTAIN RHONE ...I, I, the, the answer now is, yes. I think he does know what he's doing. 

00:53:35
MAJOR WHITE  I think that make sense to you. 

00:53:40
CAPTAIN RHONE Powerful. 

00:53:40
MAJOR WHITE  Does that sergeant get to you. 

00:53:45
CAPTAIN RHONE Yes, it is. 

00:53:45
MAJOR WHITE Is there anything that I do, ah, that are similar to the way that he gets to you. As, as, ah, been anything in our interaction which perhaps better enables you to deal with him? 

00:54:00
CAPTAIN RHONE  Well, I think no one that, ah, you were not and let me off the hotspot, and I'm gonna have to seat there and hang in there. It's very much the way I feel with him. 

00:54:10
MAJOR WHITE You know, I. (crosstalk) 

00:54:10
CAPTAIN RHONE  So, so perhaps, you know, one answer might be just hang in there, I know it's not gonna be comfortable. Go ahead and do it. 

00:54:20
MAJOR WHITE Well, how comfortable are you now with the situation... (crosstalk) 

00:54:25
CAPTAIN RHONE Hmm. 

00:54:25
MAJOR WHITE ...as it exist. 

00:54:25
CAPTAIN RHONE With you or with him? (crosstalk) 

00:54:25
MAJOR WHITE No, with the sergeant. 

00:54:25
CAPTAIN RHONE  The sergeant... (crosstalk) 

00:54:30
MAJOR WHITE I have a feel for a, (crosstalk) 

00:54:30
CAPTAIN RHONE ...not, not very. (crosstalk) 

00:54:30
MAJOR WHITE I have a good feeling for a comfortable you are now. 

00:54:30
CAPTAIN RHONE Not very comfortable with him. Feeling like, that kinds of, of issues that, ah, I'm having to deal it with him or the some, same kinds of things that I felt as I reviewed the tape and realized what was going on with me that my interaction with him really get it somethings with me the, the idea of, uhm, confidency. 

00:54:50
MAJOR WHITE  But you are confident. Aren't you? 

00:54:55
CAPTAIN RHONE Yes, yes. 

00:54:55
MAJOR WHITE  Okay. So why should that. (crosstalk) 

00:55:00
CAPTAIN RHONE I'm, I'm very confident what it is I, what it is I do. There are somethings that the, I'm unsure about. 

00:55:05
MAJOR WHITE Does that sergeant implicitly accused you of incompentency by his actions? 

00:55:10
CAPTAIN RHONE  That's what it feels like, sir. 

00:55:15
MAJOR WHITE  Are you gonna let him get away with that? 

00:55:20
CAPTAIN RHONE I have. 

00:55:20
MAJOR WHITE Are you gonna continue to let him do that to you. It seems to me that that's an expensive price to pay. In, in the frustration that you have expressed to me as I've heard you narrated, he takes a toll from you. 

00:55:35
CAPTAIN RHONE Ah. I think part of it tells, sir, is that, it particularly as I reviewed the tape. Ah, I think it's probably nothing at he's doing. I think it's probably, it may very well more likely be something that I'm doing to myself that perhaps with(ph) his behaviors through his actions and some of his words, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:55:55
MAJOR WHITE Do you, (crosstalk) 

00:55:55
CAPTAIN RHONE get in and get me. 

00:55:55
MAJOR WHITE do you perceive that, ah, he derived his freedom from something it is freedom to act in that manner from something that you do? You think what he does is your fault? 

00:56:05
CAPTAIN RHONE I suspect he derive his freedom from the things that I don't do. 

00:56:10
MAJOR WHITE Why, why would you think that that's your fault? 

00:56:10
CAPTAIN RHONE  Well, I should be in control. 

00:56:20
MAJOR WHITE What about his obligations by virtue of being a soldier to see have an obligation to do things even in your absence. 

00:56:30
CAPTAIN RHONE Yes, sir. 

00:56:30
MAJOR WHITE  Ah, it doesn't sound to me like, ah, at least as you describe it that his performance is your fault. I haven't perceive anything, ah, ah, incompetency on your part. He's the one who seems to be incompetent. Are you taking on, the, some of the blame for what he does wrong? 

00:56:50
CAPTAIN RHONE As you describe it sounds like that I, I, I think I'm, I must do that. 

00:56:55
MAJOR WHITE  Well I. (crosstalk) 

00:57:00
CAPTAIN RHONE That's a different way I looking at(ph), sir. 

00:57:00
MAJOR WHITE How do you feel about, uhm, you know, that comment upon. Well, the fact that... (crosstalk) 

00:57:05
CAPTAIN RHONE It makes me feel better. 

00:57:05
MAJOR WHITE ...these people are better than on you, I would certain tell(ph), and that's my perception on what you said that it, and how is that learning(ph)? 

00:57:15
CAPTAIN RHONE Doesn't make me feel better, uhm, certainly if I, if, if I go back and, and view his behavior as being, his responsibility. Then it certainly makes it easier for me to do some, some other kinds of things. 

00:57:30
MAJOR WHITE For instance(ph)? 

00:57:30
CAPTAIN RHONE To say, wait a minute that behavior, uhm, is not appropriate. 

00:57:35
MAJOR WHITE You think you could try that. 

00:57:40
CAPTAIN RHONE Sure. I can try that.(laughs) 

00:57:40
MAJOR WHITE Well, now, are you saying that just to say you can get out of here. 

00:57:45
CAPTAIN RHONE No, sir. I can try that. I can do that. 

00:57:45
MAJOR WHITE Well, maybe we can talk again if you want it too. Ah, after you have tried it. 

00:57:50
CAPTAIN RHONE  Well, thank you. 

00:57:55
MAJOR WHITE Okay. 

00:57:55
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  For many years, the IPF program was required for all new army drill sergeants. Can you see the value of such helping relationships, even within a highly structured organization like the military. Please note that despite the openess, the self disclosure and the egalitarian nature of the recall process, the line in role of military command are not violated. 

00:58:20
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  The colonel maintained himself as a colonel, the captain as a captain and the major as a major but the deeper understanding in clear communication were created. This kind of interaction was new, especially, for the major. If you note this how hard it was for him to resist to reverting to his old ways of relating. However, did you also notice how please he was when they new way worked well. Please also note the value of acting immediately on one's new learning, for example, at the very end, the inquirer excused himself and left the captain and major alone to talk about what they had learn during recall. This is exactly what we encourage you to do in the inquirer training exercises. Finally, wasn't that interesting how the captain's behavior with the major was similar to her behavior was the sergeant. Her assumptions about how the major perceived her show the importance similarities to the ways in which she interacted with the sergeant. 

00:59:25
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  So again, we see how we bring to each interaction all that we are and where. What's happening in the here and now follows the same template that we used in all our interactions. Only the intensity there is, perhaps through a keener awareness and understanding, we can learn to travel more direct routes and forge a new pathways.
