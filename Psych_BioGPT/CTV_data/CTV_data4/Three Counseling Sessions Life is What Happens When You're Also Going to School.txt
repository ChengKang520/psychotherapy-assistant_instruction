00:00:35
JOHN WINSLADE Hello. My name is John Winslade, and I'm a professor at California State University, San Bernardino and this video is one in a series of videos aimed at the topic of school counseling and for people interested in the field of school counseling. In this video, we are going to be looking at three different conversations, each slightly different in its focus but each of them are about the kind of conversations that I think that are important to school councils are equipped to participate in with students and schools. There has been a trained in school counseling which I think is unfortunate. And as it led to school counselors doings far too much in the way of class scheduling and preparing students for college and even cheerleading them to want to go to college and rather than what I think is far more important, which is working with students to see where schooling and for that matter, their movement towards going to college fits into the rest of their lives. It is working at this interface between school and the rest of life that I think school counselors have an important role to play to help people achieve success through schooling. This means much more than just cheerleading young people, it means working with them at the points of pain and definitely with their lives are encountering issues that interfere with their schooling or for that matter, where the schooling is interfering with other parts of their lives. In order to do this, we need to understand how the lines of force that run through school life connect with the lines of force that run through life and families and communities.

and 

00:02:15
Communities 

00:02:15
Narratives 

00:02:15
JOHN WINSLADE To do this, it's important to counselors take an interest in the narratives that people tell and at least when we talking about this from a narrative perspective. What I want to illustrate to you has been written about in couple of books on school counseling that I want to show you. One is the book that Gerald Monk and I wrote about Narrative Counseling in Schools, Powerful and Brief. And the second one is a book that I wrote with Michael Williams called Safe and Peaceful Schools, Addressing Conflict and Eliminating Violence, both of them published through Corwin press. If we are interested in what narratives people tell about their lives, we're interested in far more than just the words that tell about the stories of a situation that they are encountering. We are interested in the narratives that give shape to their whole life. The ones that they have given form to in the things that they do, the ones that express the values they are committed to, the ones that illustrate what they hold important or how to be very precious. And also the narratives that show how they respond to the world around them and the things that they are just doing. And the process we interested in narratives as places we people express their intentions for the kind of person that they want to become. But they don’t do this in isolation, they don’t do it on their own, they don’t do it only in their own head. They do it in relation to others, always in the context of their relationships for these others, in the context of what these other people say to them. I'm thinking of parents and family member and friends and teachers. In other words, they do it in the context of relationships which are being -- in which other people are trying to influence them in one way or another. In way you have any effect to influence others, you have power. In fact that’s what power is, the effect to influence other people. But power is also built upon systematic forces that make those influences sometimes more strongly felt than just being individual. In order to understand these things, according to the Analytics of Power that Michel Foucault developed which I think is the most sophisticated analysis of power available today. We need to look at the ways in which power gets expressed in the control of meanings. And in the discourses that define many of the things that people say and think. 

00:04:45
Michel Foucault 

00:04:45
Analytics of Power 

00:04:45
JOHN WINSLADE If we mistake however to think of the influence of Michel Foucault and other post modern authors, as meaning that a narrative perspective is about any kind of radial relativism. I know you can read this in some theories about, some theory text books about counseling that narrative factors assume a relative position that there isn’t any truth, it's what some people claimed. 

00:05:10
Post 

00:05:10
Modernism 

00:05:10
Radical 

00:05:10
Relativism 

00:05:10
JOHN WINSLADE I think this is non-sense. It's not that I don’t think there is a truth. I think it’s just we have to understand the truth always by being conscious of the relationship between any particular truth and the world in which people live. That is we need to see people’s lives as constrained by the forces at work in the context in which they live and in the relationships of -- that they hold with the people around them. 

00:05:35
People’s lives are 

00:05:35
constrained by the forces 

00:05:35
at work in the context in 

00:05:35
which they live 

00:05:35
JOHN WINSLADE One principle that is important in narrative factors was illustrated by Michael White and was stated by Michael White in the aphorism, the person is not the problem, the problem is the problem. 

00:05:50
The Person is not the Problem 

00:05:50
The Problem is the Problem 

00:05:50
-Michael White 

00:05:50
JOHN WINSLADE The significance of this statement is expanded again and again in the two books that I mentioned earlier on school counseling. In this video, you’ll see that the process moves towards the building of externalizing conversations, in which people's problems are talked about as outside of them located in language and in discourse and having an influence on who they are. The effects of this influence are then traced on the person and on others around them. From there, the process moves to understand how a person is responding to what is happening, to what is being done to them and to the effects of what is being done. 

00:06:30
How is the person 

00:06:30
responding to what is 

00:06:30
being done? 

00:06:30
What are the effects of 

00:06:30
what is being done? 

00:06:30
JOHN WINSLADE On top of this response, is fill their counter story, in which the person's preferences for who they might be, who they might become, who they want to show themselves to be in their relations with others is filled. 

00:06:50
Develop a counter story 

00:06:50
in which the persons preferences 

00:06:50
of who they might want to 

00:06:50
become, show themselves 

00:06:50
to be 

00:06:50
JOHN WINSLADE In this counter story, the counselor needs to be curious about and listen out for lived experience that doesn’t get encapsulated in stories. 

00:07:00
Curious about/ listening for 

00:07:00
lived experience that does not 

00:07:00
get told in stories 

00:07:00
JOHN WINSLADE In order to do this, we have to stand on the principle and believe it that young people even quite young children can be experts in their own lives. In other words, they experts in their own experience of life. 

00:07:10
People of all ages 

00:07:10
are experts in their 

00:07:10
own experience of life 

00:07:10
JOHN WINSLADE If we are curious about what helps them to do this, what makes the difference, we can find places where they start to make a difference of about even quite significant problems that they are encountering. And to be curious about what makes a difference in young people's lives and in children lives, I believe it is more important than relying on evidence that comes from other people in other places to know that something is effective. 

00:07:35
Curiosity about what makes 

00:07:35
a difference in people’s lives 

00:07:35
JOHN WINSLADE Children can tell you, students can tell you, young people can tell you what is helpful about what we are offering them as in terms of counseling if we asked them and I think it’s important to be curious about their experience of the process we are going through as well as about what’s making a difference in dealing with the problems they have struggling with. So, let’s now turn to these three videos. The first video is about a young person, a young women who is struggling with the effects of a family divorce and how it is impacting her life at school. In the second video, you’ll see another young person who is apparently in trouble for truancy at school. But the counselor being curious about the situation that the truancy has emerged out of finds that there is much more truth than just wanting to miss classes at school. And the third video is about career counseling and I will introduce a narrative approach to career counseling and before I do that, I have a few more comments to make, but let’s start with the first two videos first. 

00:08:50
JOHN WINSLADE Hi Emilio. 

00:08:50
 Hello. 

00:08:55
JOHN WINSLADE Thanks for coming in and I know this wasn’t your idea, it was the attendance officer, who asked me to talk to you. Is that your understanding? 

00:09:00
 Yeah, yeah. I gotta slip in, I came in. 

00:09:05
JOHN WINSLADE You gotta slip in? Okay. Is that okay for you to have talk about some things that have been happening because my understanding is the attendance officer wanted me to talk about you being truant from school yesterday, right? 

00:09:20
 Well, you see, I live in uncle home and the bus runs late and so, sometimes it runs late, some it’s really early it’s really like, it's really like erratic, it's time here, but it has a certain time period, where it should accurately be there by and then when I get there, sometimes it's early. So then I miss it and then because I go there like around walking distance like five minutes earlier of walking distance to get there. So basically, I can only spend to myself five minutes to get there and then so, when I go, I just wait for the bus and sometimes, it doesn’t come and so I just, I wait for next one and then I’m like -- I get to school late like 30 minutes late and so, I just don’t go to class because it’s -- interrupting class period. 

00:10:15
JOHN WINSLADE So that, is that what happen yesterday? 

00:10:15
 Yeah it’s what happened yesterday. It happens. 

00:10:20
JOHN WINSLADE So, okay, then what happened? You're 30 minutes late, didn’t go to class. 

00:10:25
 And then I just. I don’t go to class, I just -- I don’t even go to school I just wait, till the next period. 

00:10:30
JOHN WINSLADE And then what? 

00:10:30
 And then I go to the next class. 

00:10:35
JOHN WINSLADE So, you weren't get this one class, and is that right? 

00:10:35
 Sometimes, sometimes, I just don’t go to school. 

00:10:40
JOHN WINSLADE Sometimes, you don’t go to school at all for a whole day? 

00:10:45
 Yeah, yeah. 

00:10:45
JOHN WINSLADE Then when you say sometimes, this is not just the first time – it happened before, right? 

00:10:45
 No, yeah. 

00:10:50
JOHN WINSLADE And do you mind, if I ask like how much are we talking about, how bigger problem is this? 

00:10:55
 Sometime here probably like, I don’t know 30 days, like a month time. 

00:11:00
JOHN WINSLADE 30 days. 

00:11:05
 Throughout the year. 

00:11:05
JOHN WINSLADE Throughout the year? Well, okay. And is that always being an issue of the bus or is anything else that's involved? 

00:11:15
 Sometimes like -- sometimes when the forecast is raining for the next day, I ask my mom to take me to school because sometimes she can and sometimes she can’t. But since it's raining, I usually I do ask her to go to, take me and sometimes she just, she says yes, but she doesn’t take me. 

00:11:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:11:35
 So like I’m waiting for her and then she doesn’t -- she didn't take me. It still raining, so... 

00:11:45
JOHN WINSLADE What I’m understanding here is that you got these circumstances that get in -- that interfere, right? 

00:11:50
 Yeah. 

00:11:50
JOHN WINSLADE Like the bus being early or and you missing it or your mom not being able to take you and but I’m also understood in what happens to you in that in those moments right. 

00:12:10
 Yeah, well. 

00:12:10
JOHN WINSLADE Because it sounds like, there is more truant than just the circumstances, it's kind of what you really do with the circumstances. 

00:12:15
 Yeah. I don’t like -- I don’t feel particularly good, because sometimes like, when I ask my mom she should care, and since she doesn’t take me, I don’t feel like she cares. And so then, when I go by myself, it just I feel kind of depressed especially since I’m late to school and I feel like I let down my teachers for not going to school, I mean, if I’m not going to class or for being late and then walking in the middle of the class being late and then interrupting the whole process of learning and I don't like -- when I go to school on time and then see people they're late, they usually get mad because they're late. 

00:12:55
JOHN WINSLADE Teachers get mad. 

00:12:55
 Yeah, yeah, you see it happen and then that's and then you can imagine yourself own at you that doesn't feel good. 

00:13:05
JOHN WINSLADE So it's like, you're kind of on the bus thinking I’m going to be late. 

00:13:10
 Yeah. 

00:13:10
JOHN WINSLADE Get the school late and already replaying the teachers getting mad in your mind before it is even happened, is that right? 

00:13:15
 And then... 

00:13:15
JOHN WINSLADE That is what get you depressed, is it? 

00:13:20
 Yeah, it just puts me like -- it puts me down and then it --. 

00:13:20
JOHN WINSLADE It puts you down. 

00:13:25
 Yeah. 

00:13:25
JOHN WINSLADE And okay. And tell me about your mom, because you said that the conclusion you would drawing was that she doesn’t care. 

00:13:35
 Oh, yeah because she is a single mom, which I know she works a lot and she's doing the most everything she’s got and she's trying to keep us afloat in our home and all that and I know that it's hard for her, but I feel like she just, she doesn’t care even though I know, I know that she is doing for me but I just, I like to see her and to see her cares about me. 

00:14:00
JOHN WINSLADE So you know that she and something she does care, but you also wanted to care about something else. 

00:14:05
 Yeah, like. 

00:14:05
JOHN WINSLADE What? 

00:14:05
 Give me attention, I guess. 

00:14:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:14:05
 Right. 

00:14:10
JOHN WINSLADE For anything in particular? 

00:14:10
 Well, not really like, like well I do sport and she -- I've never seen her going to any -- I mean I tell her all the time when, what, what time where and she just, she doesn’t go, But I guess because she is tired or something from work. 

00:14:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, that's one thing you would like her to give you some more attention for? 

00:14:35
 Yeah, I would like her to show that she cares other than just trying to attractive, 

00:14:45
JOHN WINSLADE Keep things afloat. 

00:14:45
 Yeah, satiate me and like I don’t know, keep me from not being on the streets. 

00:14:55
JOHN WINSLADE So is it, is it like when you decided not to go to class and some ways this is like some kind of protest that your mom not caring enough, on some days not every day. 

00:15:10
 Yeah, kinda, just like, I don’t feel like going to school, feel like ah, feel like being interactive with people and just I don’t want to be there and because. 

00:15:25
JOHN WINSLADE Don’t wanna interact with people. 

00:15:30
 I don’t feel like going there and being a part of everybody like talking or having a contact. And I just feel like being alone. 

00:15:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so you... 

00:15:40
 Because, usually it starts when I think about my mom and then all that happens and I just feel like well may be if I don’t go to school and then she actually give me attention by like fighting or something like yelling at me. Just kind of showing she cares. 

00:16:00
JOHN WINSLADE Like that feels better, when... 

00:16:00
 Kinda, she finally gives me attention. 

00:16:05
JOHN WINSLADE Really, okay, even she is, even if it's a fight. 

00:16:05
 No. she is still actually doing something for me in a way. 

00:16:10
JOHN WINSLADE So, let me see if I’m getting this right. It’s like even on the time when it’s just to do with the bus, there's a sense that you have, that you would like your mom to care about what's happening to you matter to more her and so you think about that and you don’t really want to interact with anybody at school you kind of just want to be on your own and in those moments what you’re thinking about is that you’d like your mom to, you’d like to matter to your mom this way. You like things that matter to her more that are important to you that going on your life. 

00:17:00
 Yeah, I kind of feel selfish, I want to be selfish and I want to see her if she selfless. 

00:17:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:17:05
 Okay. Like she is selfless, but I want to see it in a different way other than for money. 

00:17:10
JOHN WINSLADE Right. So okay, so that’s what going on for you in this situation and what I'm wondering about this saying, what happens like, what -- how is this get read by your teacher, the school, other kids, your mom do you have any brothers and sisters? 

00:17:30
 No, well I do, but they don’t live with me. I have one sister, who lives with us when she, she doesn’t really have a career and she doesn't -- I don’t know what she doing with her life, I never like had a conversation with her, so she is 22 I think right now and she is I don’t know she staying us, she stays with us. Yeah. 

00:17:55
JOHN WINSLADE So maybe she comes into this as well or not, but how does all of this get read by other people right, what are the people think about what’s going on? Because my guess is this is kind of – you know, the teachers are aware of, other kids are aware of, your mom's aware of that you have been missing school for 30 days, is that right or... 

00:18:15
 Yeah, like, I mean, it's not in a row, I mean particularly... 

00:18:20
JOHN WINSLADE No. 

00:18:25
 It's throughout the year. 

00:18:25
JOHN WINSLADE Has it built a reputation for you? 

00:18:30
 Not really. I mean it -- I guess the teachers kind of played off, like it’s a funny in that, like "Oh, I finally get to see you today". 

00:18:35
JOHN WINSLADE Really? 

00:18:35
 Yeah. 

00:18:40
JOHN WINSLADE And they don’t get mad at you. 

00:18:45
 I don’t think so and then I don’t feel anything -- I don’t feel of a negativity towards me like a need for... 

00:18:50
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:18:50
 Or like, atmosphere. 

00:18:50
JOHN WINSLADE I’m curious about how come you manage the situations that you don’t get the negativity when you see other people, the teachers do get mad like you're saying before. 

00:19:00
 Well, that’s why I don’t want to go to school. Because I, that way I can just ignore the whole thing. 

00:19:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:19:10
 Like, I can just go around it. 

00:19:15
JOHN WINSLADE So, when they say, they finally get to see you, that's like on another day, when you are on time. 

00:19:20
 Yeah. 

00:19:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, you go around the negativity and get to place, where you were treated as funny. 

00:19:30
 Kinda, I mean sometimes I don’t say anything, sometimes I just, when I go to school, I go to school in time and everything throughout the day is the same schedule. 

00:19:35
JOHN WINSLADE Is that good, you say? 

00:19:40
 Yeah. I feel better. 

00:19:40
JOHN WINSLADE You don't feel depressed? 

00:19:40
 No, I don’t feel depressed and I don’t feel sad or any of those kind of emotions. 

00:19:45
JOHN WINSLADE You don’t need to be on your own to much? 

00:19:50
 Like the day goes as scheduled. It goes good. 

00:19:55
JOHN WINSLADE You don’t like -- you don’t have to amount a protest against your mom, not caring enough, on that day? 

00:20:00
 It’s sometimes I feel it, sometimes I don’t, sometimes I feel like as she actually cares and then some fine but sometimes it hits me. It just concentrates on a certain day and then I just feel like -- I feel like being alone. 

00:20:20
JOHN WINSLADE On the days, once you have the sense that she does care what is that it gives you the sense? 

00:20:25
 Like she cooks for me or she’s actually home on time and then she hangs out a little bit, if I can get interact. 

00:20:35
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:20:35
 Yeah, that’s what the stuff kind of. 

00:20:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:20:45
 I don't really go out usually. 

00:20:45
JOHN WINSLADE You don’t go out? 

00:20:45
 No, I was usually at home. 

00:20:45
JOHN WINSLADE At home. Okay. So when like, when the attendance officer asked me to speak to you, like was this, is this really being the first time that he wants really talk to you about this? 

00:21:10
 I mean, no I've got listed before, but I didn’t come. I just keep going to class, another class, but I didn’t this is kind of the first time. 

00:21:20
JOHN WINSLADE This is the first time. So --. 

00:21:20
 Talking to somebody. 

00:21:20
JOHN WINSLADE So, in a sense, we’re talking about looking at this whole issue for the first time. And as you look at it now, I’m interested in what you make if it all and what your thinking about, what we are talking about and like how is it all sitting for you? 

00:21:40
 I mean at school I – I mean I can learn the subject of the day. Just one day, and I don’t mind going into books and e-learning or not e-learning, but learning from my first time since entering the school and so, it's not hard, it is just -- 

00:21:55
JOHN WINSLADE That’s not the problem, right? 

00:22:00
 Sure. 

00:22:00
JOHN WINSLADE Learning is not a problem. 

00:22:00
 Yeah, learning is not the problem. It’s just – I didn’t really understand the question. Kind of. 

00:22:10
JOHN WINSLADE Well, I guess I understood and you know this whole situation because you know, you’re saying that this is you told me little a bit about what’s happened and we're talking about this being something like pattern that’s happened a number of times, you know 30 days is quite a number of days where this is happened right, over the course of the year. Did it happen last year as well? 

00:22:35
 Yeah, but it wasn't as many. 

00:22:35
JOHN WINSLADE So it’s kind of got bigger. 

00:22:40
 Yeah it got bigger. 

00:22:40
JOHN WINSLADE Right okay. Do you know why it’s got bigger or what’s it made it get bigger? 

00:22:45
 Probably the, just not being able to, to, to -- maybe be here at school. 

00:23:00
JOHN WINSLADE What do you mean? 

00:23:00
 Like being at school, and then going out of it and then every single day having the same thoughts of, if this is going to change. 

00:23:10
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Okay. So those thoughts of kind of, if it’s going to change, it gotten stronger. 

00:23:15
 Yeah. Like it's been sitting there and more and collecting more and getting bigger. 

00:23:20
JOHN WINSLADE As those thoughts have got stronger what effect that they had on you? 

00:23:25
 Well, I don’t know, I've been coming more distant to my friends. 

00:23:30
JOHN WINSLADE Oh really? 

00:23:30
 Yeah, I like to alone more now. 

00:23:35
JOHN WINSLADE So those thoughts have kind of distanced you from your friends a little bit? 

00:23:40
 Yeah. It somewhat like throughout the day, I do like when I’m not alone, when I am not sure, when I don't go to school I sometimes get the emotions back, just feeling for brief period and so, that's why feel like being alone, so I distant myself. 

00:24:00
JOHN WINSLADE The emotions that you talked about feeling depressed and put down a little and being alone and not wanting to interact with people, that kind of stuff, feeling sad. 

00:24:10
 Feeling the negative emotions. 

00:24:10
JOHN WINSLADE The negative emotions, right. 

00:24:15
 This usually happens during lunch and that’s why I don’t see my friends. 

00:24:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Alright, so it kind of built up during the morning event. 

00:24:20
 Kinda, yeah, because I have -- well since I live in Oklahoma and I go to school in Spring Valley, I had the whole time to think about it. And takes like around 45 to 50 minutes to get there. 

00:24:35
JOHN WINSLADE To get there. And so the thoughts are well underway through those 45 minutes. 

00:24:40
 Yeah. They're just --I’m thinking about 'em, seeing if I can do anything else to change it, change the whole like situation of my mom and going school. 

00:24:50
JOHN WINSLADE What do you come up with in those points, do you think about something else? 

00:24:55
 Just ways to like either get my own, be happy, work for me, like winning a race maybe and bringing home a medal, because it's first place or something that’s happened once for sure. 

00:25:10
JOHN WINSLADE That happened once. 

00:25:10
 Yeah, she didn’t really -- she said good job, but that's it. It didn't make it a big deal like I would wanted it to be. Or other things like being truant more, seeing if she actually cares, exiting on time on school and seeing if my attendance is better and seeing if she sees that too or being able to get an award for being good in school and seeing if she cares about that. 

00:25:45
JOHN WINSLADE Did that happen? 

00:25:45
 Well last year, did. 

00:25:45
JOHN WINSLADE Last year? 

00:25:50
 She came to it, but she just said like good job or something, she didn't really, I cannot make a big deal out of it, I don’t know if that she should, shouldn't just would feel good, if she did. 

00:26:00
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, okay. So, on the sort of picturing, what this is like for you and these days when the you know, it's starts off with the bus ride, if you got the school bus on time or even if you --. 

00:26:15
 That's not the school bus, it's city bus. 

00:26:20
JOHN WINSLADE City bus right, right okay. And then you got a 45 minutes bus ride and the thoughts are gathering and they start to get stronger and they interrupt your relationship with your friends and keeping distance from them and have you kind of contemplating ways to get your mom take more notice of you. So you -- your mind turns to kind of focus about, what you might do in that regard, you know but we can't win a race every day, right? 

00:26:55
 Yeah. 

00:26:55
JOHN WINSLADE We will get to school every day. 

00:26:55
 It usually happens at the end of the year or some important races, because those are, when you get medals, you know really usually get medals during meets. 

00:27:05
JOHN WINSLADE So, I’m getting picture of whole situation now. This whole situation of this kind of growing thing because, it's bigger than it was last year right? And this whole situation could grow even bigger I don't know. 

00:27:25
 Probably, maybe if -- I don't know. I mean I can imagine it since it's been happening -- it got bigger over a year. 

00:27:30
JOHN WINSLADE It will get bigger so. 

00:27:35
 Yeah. Maybe since its has gotten bigger. I’m not sure. 

00:27:35
JOHN WINSLADE And, what would happen if it did, what would that be like? 

00:27:40
 It probably maybe distance myself to my family, not so much care about them. 

00:27:50
JOHN WINSLADE Alright, so you try to kind of -- you feel more and more isolated, more and more in your own, more and more distance. 

00:27:55
 Taking a shell, maybe. 

00:27:55
JOHN WINSLADE Living in a shell, almost. You said what you want, would you like that do happen or would you prefer anything different. 

00:28:05
 I mean, it feels than to be denying by family. 

00:28:10
JOHN WINSLADE Right, okay. So there's something interactive about it and feels better than that. Is it what you would prefer if you could really have what you prefer? 

00:28:25
 No, I won't. If it was between that and actually having everything that I want in that was meaningful to me, then I won't choose that. 

00:28:35
JOHN WINSLADE So, okay. What’s meaningful for me would be what? 

00:28:45
 I would be having probably more attention since that’s what basics kind of started me and not being get up on time or not on time, but like getting up early because I know I can get up earlier, but since I look so far away, I kind of want to get all the sleep that I can, but then sometimes I get, I just I don't care. So, I just keep sleeping even though, I know that I will be like two minutes late, little bit late. 

00:29:10
JOHN WINSLADE Out of time. 

00:29:10
 Yeah, close to like being on the border of being late. So, I just feel. 

00:29:20
JOHN WINSLADE So, this like -- does this whole situation increase that feeling of don't really care. 

00:29:25
 Which situation? 

00:29:25
JOHN WINSLADE Well, that the whole situation that you described, this kind of got bigger over the last year, that left you more, more distance and couldn't get worse, right? 

00:29:35
 Yeah. 

00:29:35
JOHN WINSLADE This is one of things that produces that sort of stronger likelihood that you're gonna have the I don’t care feeling. 

00:29:40
 Yeah. 

00:29:45
JOHN WINSLADE And like to sleep much. 

00:29:45
 Like the I don't care feeling, or not having initiate to get up in the morning, having what is called -- having the, the want to get up. 

00:29:55
JOHN WINSLADE Right, right. And so, it interferes with want to get up. 

00:30:00
 Yeah. 

00:30:00
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:30:00
 Like, I don't want to deal with the day. 

00:30:05
JOHN WINSLADE And it interferes with your school, does it have an effect on your learning? 

00:30:10
 It does to a point, where I know I can learn easier to teachers because they make it easier and they make it fun and they are more -- they are showing better than you taking the initiative to get in the book and start reading. But, I don’t find it hard to just get in the book and read. 

00:30:30
JOHN WINSLADE It something you find to learning hard. 

00:30:30
 But I know, it would be easier. 

00:30:35
JOHN WINSLADE But that would be easier, right. You wouldn't have to do so much catching up, if you like, okay. And if this whole thing would get worse, would it have any impact on your life, I mean I’m thinking about the bigger picture of your life in terms of school and qualifications and moving forward and where you wanted go, I don’t know what your plans are. You're a senior, what are your plans for next year? 

00:31:00
 To go college, of course. 

00:31:00
JOHN WINSLADE Go to college. 

00:31:05
 And then continuing my education to something that I would like to be in. 

00:31:10
JOHN WINSLADE Like what any what’s your--. 

00:31:10
 Well I do like math. 

00:31:15
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:31:15
 Math is very good subject that I like, it's my favorite subject. 

00:31:20
JOHN WINSLADE Great. 

00:31:20
 And I think I’m, I think I'm good in it. 

00:31:20
JOHN WINSLADE Great. 

00:31:25
 And so, I would like continue into electrical engineering. 

00:31:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:31:30
 Yeah. 

00:31:30
JOHN WINSLADE So, does this whole problem threatens your ability to do that, get into electrical engineering? 

00:31:40
 Yeah, it does probably, but I know probably I want some more that I can do things from my own and then once I create the shell, I will be upon myself, I will be by my own and then not feel any of that negatively other than being alone and I get probably do it but I’ll be much happier if it didn’t happen that way. 

00:32:05
JOHN WINSLADE If it didn’t happen that way. Yes, so you know you can get by, but not it wouldn’t be really, really happy. 

00:32:10
 I wouldn’t be myself. 

00:32:15
JOHN WINSLADE Right, okay. I guess, what I’m wondering about is here it's like -- what you've described is the situation that has an effect on you at the moment, it does distance your from people, it does create the shell around you, it is creating the truancy problem that we've been talking about, it's actually getting worse over the last year. And it could get worse too, you recognize that. 

00:32:40
 Yeah. 

00:32:40
JOHN WINSLADE And it could actually you know you can get by, but it could interfere with your future if you allowed it to. And it's not really what you would prefer, you'd really prefer to happy. 

00:32:55
 Definitely for that. 

00:32:55
JOHN WINSLADE And some, I’m interested in, what ideas you have or what experiences you have about doing things that can create a better happiness for you. Or did you try it in anyway that’s worked? I don't know, you run that race and won a medal and that kind of was okay for a little moment. 

00:33:25
 Yeah, for a little moment, but I can’t do it all the time. 

00:33:25
JOHN WINSLADE No. 

00:33:30
 It’s hard. 

00:33:30
JOHN WINSLADE It’s hard. 

00:33:30
 Yeah. 

00:33:30
JOHN WINSLADE I don't now, when you -- if you thought about this, I don't know. 

00:33:35
 Yeah, really I thought maybe this would work, but I don't -- I don't really have backup plan. 

00:33:40
JOHN WINSLADE Maybe the kind of distancing yourself and being in your shell would work. 

00:33:45
 Yeah. 

00:33:45
JOHN WINSLADE But you've got some doubts about that, I think. 

00:33:50
 Yeah, because it's -- I mean distancing myself wouldn't be my most favorable option because favorable option because, I would like keep my relationship with my mom. 

00:34:00
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:34:00
 Because, she supports me. 

00:34:00
JOHN WINSLADE Right, right. 

00:34:05
 And, I know that but it just doesn't feel good. 

00:34:05
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, so, you'd like to keep your relationship with your mommy, would-- and would you also not want to be distance from your friend, does this (inaudible ). 

00:34:14
 Yeah, probably. 

00:34:15
JOHN WINSLADE You afraid? 

00:34:15
 It will be fun to hang out with them well, I like to hang out with them. 

00:34:20
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, yeah. 

00:34:20
 Yeah. 

00:34:20
JOHN WINSLADE Because you enjoy I imagine the friendships that you have. 

00:34:25
 Yeah. that’s why they are my friends. 

00:34:30
JOHN WINSLADE So, if I understanding you right, and you would prefer this whole truancy situation and all the stuff that goes with it, wasn't so necessary. 

00:34:45
 Yeah. 

00:34:45
JOHN WINSLADE And you would you like your relationship with your mom to be in a different place, which kind of adds more the -- and it created more happiness for you? 

00:34:55
 Yeah. 

00:34:55
JOHN WINSLADE But at the moment am I right in thinking that you haven't quite found a way to get that to happen? 

00:35:00
 Yeah, I haven't been -- yeah because I’m not satisfied in that. 

00:35:10
JOHN WINSLADE Your are not satisfied, right okay. So, what’s -- I always interested in not just what ideas you might have out of nowhere, but what ideas have you had out of what's happened in your life that might give you a chance maybe I can dream up an ideas but that wouldn’t necessary fit in you life right? 

00:35:35
 Yeah. 

00:35:35
JOHN WINSLADE And you could dream up ideas that would necessarily fit in your life either, that -- so I’m interested in the ideas that do fit in your life because you had little inklings of them giving you that opening to something different. 

00:35:45
 Yeah. 

00:35:45
JOHN WINSLADE Anything coming to mind? 

00:35:50
 Probably try just to make my mom easier, giving her like a break and so maybe in a way just do everything right and better and actually going to school, trying to be happy, not minding that she’s not there, because I know that she is doing things for me. 

00:36:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:36:15
 Try to be stronger for her, but just. 

00:36:25
JOHN WINSLADE This is slightly a different kind of way of thinking about things. 

00:36:30
 It's full of positive way but it doesn't -- its not that easier, it's not favorable because it's-- 

00:36:30
JOHN WINSLADE It's not easier. 

00:36:35
 Yeah, it just. 

00:36:35
JOHN WINSLADE And so, I’m understand each of these thing, doing everything better, giving her a break, being stronger, more positive. Um, like how would you do that, and maybe you have tried to do those things like when you talk about giving her break for example, what would that be like? 

00:36:55
 Kind of not, because we get into fights pretty often. 

00:37:00
JOHN WINSLADE Do you? 

00:37:00
 And that’s just because -- not really I usually start it, because, yeah. So, she's -- 

00:37:05
JOHN WINSLADE You just want to trick her up or something? 

00:37:10
 No, because she's giving me attention. 

00:37:10
JOHN WINSLADE Oh, okay. 

00:37:10
 Yeah, so I do it on purpose. 

00:37:15
JOHN WINSLADE Can you define other ways to get her attention, other than giving your -- getting to a fight? 

00:37:20
 No, really usually she just goes to bed or starts just being on the couch and dozes off, she is usually tired. 

00:37:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so giving her break means what? 

00:37:30
 Means being easier and trying not to -- try not to be a nuisance for her. 

00:37:35
JOHN WINSLADE Have you ever done that? You must did, I'm sure, you mentioned at some point in the ten years. 

00:37:45
 Yeah, yeah. 

00:37:45
JOHN WINSLADE What do you do when you give her break? What do you do? 

00:37:50
 Usually, I didn’t break, I try a make everything easier for once she comes home like late. 

00:37:55
JOHN WINSLADE Like what -- if I was your mom coming home and what would be doing that would let me know that you trying to give a break. 

00:38:05
 Like give her the TV or make food for us instead of her always making the food, giving, I mean, 

00:38:10
JOHN WINSLADE And do some -- take some initiatives at home. 

00:38:15
 Taking initiative at home, exactly. 

00:38:15
JOHN WINSLADE And when you do that, I mean, I imagine you can think of times when you done that right. 

00:38:20
 I've done that. 

00:38:20
JOHN WINSLADE What she said, how she respond? 

00:38:25
 She says, she said only-- she says thank you, it doesn’t feel like she's giving me enough attention, giving me enough --. 

00:38:35
JOHN WINSLADE So you want it little bit more? 

00:38:35
  Yeah. I kind of. I wanted to be there for me. 

00:38:45
JOHN WINSLADE I’m just picturing this, you've done something, she says thank you and your thing that’s okay. But, I want a bit more. 

00:38:50
 Yeah. 

00:38:55
JOHN WINSLADE What do you say? 

00:38:55
 I don’t say anything, I accept it. 

00:39:00
JOHN WINSLADE You accept the thank you. 

00:39:00
 Yeah, and – 

00:39:00
JOHN WINSLADE So is that okay between you at that moment, but you want something kinder. 

00:39:05
  I just I feel like, well okay she said thank you, that’s fine, that’s good enough I mean, it’s a thank you. It’s appreciation. 

00:39:15
JOHN WINSLADE Yes, yes. 

00:39:15
 And so, I feel like she would, like may be pay attention any more or like – 

00:39:25
JOHN WINSLADE So, okay just pause that moment for a second. What would she do that would give you attention on that moment, more than. 

00:39:30
 May be hang out with her or maybe watch TV the same thing like at the same time. But usually watches something that I don’t like so. 

00:39:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, okay. 

00:39:40
 I don’t like watching TV with her, if we found something that we’ll enjoy together, maybe even go out once or twice just because we don’t usually do it for maybe more often. 

00:39:50
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:39:50
 Maybe, hope seeing her on the weekends. 

00:39:55
JOHN WINSLADE Does your mom know that you would like to hang out with her little bit more on those moments? 

00:40:00
 No. 

00:40:00
JOHN WINSLADE How comes she don’t know? 

00:40:05
 I don’t feel like to telling her, I don't feel like expressing my felling towards her. 

00:40:10
JOHN WINSLADE Because. 

00:40:10
 Because, maybe as your son she should be able to feel them. 

00:40:15
JOHN WINSLADE She should be able to guess? Why because that’s what moms do? 

00:40:20
 Yeah. 

00:40:20
JOHN WINSLADE And, and I’m thinking, I you know like, how old are you now? 

00:40:30
 I’m ought to be 17. 

00:40:30
JOHN WINSLADE Right, okay. Do you thing like how old do you thing you have to be before your mom wouldn’t have to give such things, that you would feel old enough. So you could sort of talk to her about. 

00:40:45
 I don't know. 

00:40:50
JOHN WINSLADE Because she's not going to be your caretaker. 

00:40:55
 Yeah, yeah. So, I guess want to maintain, then I have to take care of myself and maybe. 

00:41:00
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

00:41:00
 And maybe well, well probably start providing for myself. 

00:41:05
JOHN WINSLADE Right and you shouldn’t have -- difference in that, so you wouldn’t have to... 

00:41:10
 Yeah. 

00:41:10
JOHN WINSLADE If you depending on your mom doing these things for you. 

00:41:15
 Sure enough the work is much. 

00:41:15
JOHN WINSLADE And that’s what you would like to be in that situation, like? 

00:41:20
 Just, yeah because -- 

00:41:20
JOHN WINSLADE What your relationship would it be like if that was the case? 

00:41:25
 I can see her more probably, she probably at home more. 

00:41:30
JOHN WINSLADE And when you saw her, and when you are home, would there be different quality to the relationship? 

00:41:35
 Yeah, because she won't be as tired, she conversate more. 

00:41:40
JOHN WINSLADE Right. That what she (crosstalk) differently 

00:41:40
 I’d probably happier since she's conversating with me more and--. 

00:41:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:41:45
 And I would be -- I don't know, I’m going to work, but I'd be home too. 

00:41:50
JOHN WINSLADE So, we're talking about, after you're 18 and after you're-- I would have provide more for her and be, you know less dependent on her. Has there in anyways in which you practicing for that now? 

00:42:05
 Not really. 

00:42:05
JOHN WINSLADE This is not far off, isn’t? 

00:42:05
 No, it's not far off, but I’m haven't practicing anything just 

00:42:10
JOHN WINSLADE Is this -- what you thing about that idea of practicing for that now? 

00:42:15
 If it helps me get happier than I guess, I do get things something I want. 

00:42:25
JOHN WINSLADE So, does that mean that it appeals to you a little bit? 

00:42:25
 Umm hmm. 

00:42:30
JOHN WINSLADE So, yeah, okay. So maybe we need to keep talking about what -- how you could practice, get things to a point in your relationship with your mom, where it less like she is just the adult, when you are a little child and more of like you're kind of 18 and more grown enough and more supportive and more, more like could adopt relationship with each other. 

00:42:50
 I'll probably get a job and start providing. 

00:42:55
JOHN WINSLADE Start providing – 

00:42:55
 Somehow contributing yes. 

00:43:00
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, and so that will be the kind of financial problem. But there's also the compensation part, the hanging out part, because you said that was some important right. Getting a job does necessary really mean, you get to hang out more. 

00:43:15
 Yeah. 

00:43:15
JOHN WINSLADE  But so this is something you need do there to what would have be. 

00:43:25
 I don’t know. 

00:43:25
JOHN WINSLADE You’re not sure, this is where you struggle, isn't it? 

00:43:25
 Yeah. 

00:43:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. But it would be something to do because you said before you would like to be able to have a conversation with her to hangout and to share some time -- you may even if just sitting, watching TV together, but you're watching something that you both want. 

00:43:40
 Yeah. 

00:43:40
JOHN WINSLADE Rather than just you kind of saying, oh that’s your thing, I'm gonna let you do it, because she is the adult. 

00:43:45
 Yeah. 

00:43:45
JOHN WINSLADE Does she -- would she listen to you if you talk to you and said let's talk about what we can watch together? 

00:43:50
 I don’t know she, I mean she watches it -- she likes the shows, she said, I mean she watches it, she comes home and then she specifically makes time for it, even though if she is tired. She’s tired, she gets on the couch and I don’t know but she -- I mean she's like schedule kind of. 

00:44:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, she has her schedule right. 

00:44:15
 Yeah and then she does it, but I can see her tired, tired all time she's trying to relax. 

00:44:20
JOHN WINSLADE Right, right, right. 

00:44:20
 So, if I talk to her, then we feel like... 

00:44:25
JOHN WINSLADE You fell like interfering with her. 

00:44:25
 Yeah. 

00:44:25
JOHN WINSLADE Relaxing – sometime. 

00:44:25
 Like, I’m the nuisance or burden and I wouldn't rather do that because she has to work the next day. 

00:44:35
JOHN WINSLADE So, I don’t know what that feels like to you when you describe it like that, but I’m wondering whether that sounds like really going back to being a kid in that moment like I need to let her be the adult who's tired and rather than what we’re talking about a minute ago, which was practicing for more adult relationship between you. Do you understand the difference? 

00:44:55
 Yeah. I kinda yeah but... 

00:45:00
JOHN WINSLADE But the question is which would you choose in that moment. 

00:45:05
 Probably being more adult and maybe try to interfere with her maybe, try to express myself to her and see if she respond in a positive way. 

00:45:15
JOHN WINSLADE Right, right yeah. And if you did that, what would you want her to respond with, what you imagine her to respond would be? 

00:45:25
 Be happy about it maybe, me taking initiative of telling her that I would like to spend more time with her. 

00:45:35
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:45:35
 And, she would accept that. 

00:45:35
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:45:35
 Okay. 

00:45:35
JOHN WINSLADE What I’m -- I don’t know you mom. So, and you know that’s possibility that maybe we could meet with her and talk about these things together, if you were interested in that. 

00:45:45
 Yeah. If she is out for it, I mean, I don’t know, she has plenty of work to do. 

00:45:50
JOHN WINSLADE I don’t know whether, for example, I don’t know whether she is ready for you to grow up yet or not, I don’t know that. 

00:46:00
 Yeah, I’m... 

00:46:00
JOHN WINSLADE And may be it take, may take a little bit of more practice for both of you to figure this out. I don’t know whether she is going to respond immediately with enthusiasm and happiness. And, I don’t know whether you are interested in keeping on pursuing this, so would you. 

00:46:20
 If this creates positive atmosphere and makes me more happy then, yeah. 

00:46:25
JOHN WINSLADE Then you would. 

00:46:25
 Yeah. If it works. 

00:46:30
JOHN WINSLADE All right. Our time is ending up here at the moment. So, I'm wondering whether we can just pause here but and first of all, I would like to keep in touch with you about how this is going, because it sounds like you're moving towards as a project of growing a different kind of relationship with your mom. 

00:46:50
 Yeah, definitely. 

00:46:55
JOHN WINSLADE And if you do that, it will make a difference to you feeling less distance both from here and both from -- and from school and from your friends as well. And listen to that future that could threaten your hopes to become electrical engineer. And in the process hopefully kind of grow a more adult relationship with your mom, my guess is, I don’t know, my guess is there is probably a part of her that would like that too. I don’t know. 

00:47:25
 Probably if I make her happy too. 

00:47:30
JOHN WINSLADE Right, she could enjoy having your company even. 

00:47:35
 Because, I guess she is lonely when she gets home and she is -- it's because she works every day, doesn't really have. 

00:47:40
JOHN WINSLADE Right, the tiredness and loneliness and all those kind of things overtake both of you almost from that point and prevent you from actually connecting with each other. 

00:47:45
 Probably. 

00:47:50
JOHN WINSLADE So, I mean if you like I will be happy to invite you to come in and we can talk about this, what's being going on and what we've been talking about together. So, you can sort it out on your own, it's up to you. 

00:48:00
 I think probably, if she actually has time and we could probably come together and see if -- because, it would probably more comfortable for me, instead of me. 

00:48:10
JOHN WINSLADE To sort of initiate it and we talked about up here. Yeah, yeah, okay. Well let’s see if we can figure out a way to do that. Okay 

00:48:20
 Okay. 

00:48:20
JOHN WINSLADE And we will keep in touch about this. 

00:48:20
 Okay. 

00:48:25
JOHN WINSLADE Thanks, Emilio, I appreciate the chance to talk to you about it. 

00:48:25
 Thank you. Helped me a lot. 

00:48:30
JOHN WINSLADE Good. Okay, well, hi, Andrea. 

00:48:35
 Hi. 

00:48:35
JOHN WINSLADE I remember seeing you around the school little while, ever haven't seen you for a little while, so it’s nice to see you again. 

00:48:45
 It’s nice to see you too. 

00:48:45
JOHN WINSLADE And, actually last time I saw you was the -- I kind of watched the Bye Bye Birdie thing and you were in that. 

00:48:55
 Yes. 

00:48:55
JOHN WINSLADE Was that good? 

00:48:55
 Yes, you enjoyed it? 

00:48:55
JOHN WINSLADE I love that. Yeah it’s a great show and you guys you're really made it come alive, it was so great. 

00:49:05
 Thank you. 

00:49:05
JOHN WINSLADE What's the name of your character, I can't remember the name of the character, but I remember you but I don't know what she was called. 

00:49:10
 I played Kim MacAfee. 

00:49:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:49:10
 Yeah. 

00:49:15
JOHN WINSLADE And that's pretty neat role, right. 

00:49:15
 Yes, it was really fun. 

00:49:15
JOHN WINSLADE That’s great. 

00:49:15
 I really enjoyed it. 

00:49:20
JOHN WINSLADE Well, so as I said, good to see you again, but like this is, you're liking your singing here is that right. Right, so you are kind of approaching graduation and things like that. 

00:49:30
 Yeah. 

00:49:35
JOHN WINSLADE That must be something positive that you're looking at, am I right or not? 

00:49:40
 Yeah, I am excited. 

00:49:40
JOHN WINSLADE You excited for that. Okay. That's great. I’ll hope it leads to good things in your life after your graduate. But like, you may have disappointment because I hadn't asked to see you, you asked to see me and I am assuming that something on your mind that you kind of, would like to talk about it or bring along or what else? Tell me a little bit about why you made this time to --. 

00:50:10
 Oh, well, my parent stay divorced and recently my dad mentioned that he had a girlfriend for some time. 

00:50:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:50:25
 He never chooses the share with us. Because it might not have lasted as some relationships though, but he recently told my sister and I that, he would like us to meet her and I just, I don't know it made me uncomfortable that I just, I don't know, what to tell and I don't know what to say, I don't know what would be appropriate. 

00:50:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:50:55
 What would be the correct thing to do. 

00:51:00
JOHN WINSLADE So, is that like you are not really sure about, where you stand or how to make sensitive for yourself. Is that right? 

00:51:10
 Right. I don't know, if what I am feeling is correct. And I don't know want to -- I don't want to do something wrong in my behavior, I don't want to affect anybody badly. I want to everyone to be okay. But I just don't know, how I should behave. 

00:51:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. When you say you want everyone to be okay, who you is thinking of especially? 

00:51:35
 I am thinking of my dad and I am thinking of my siblings, I -- my sister is younger than me, I know she is looks up to me and I want to be a good influence for her. 

00:51:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:51:50
 So, you want to be a good influence to her, so, it's not just for yourself that you're concerned about this is, it's the impact on others as well, right? 

00:51:55
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:51:55
 And then your relationships with your dad and your sister. 

00:52:00
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:52:00
 Anyone else you thinking of? 

00:52:05
JOHN WINSLADE I guess my whole family. I, my mom, she knows about it and well, she is fine and I have an elder brother and elder sister. 

00:52:15
 Okay. 

00:52:15
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. 

00:52:20
 So, you concerned about them, but the first people you mentioned were your dad and your sister, right? 

00:52:20
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:52:25
 And yourself? 

00:52:25
JOHN WINSLADE Right. I mean, we're the ones living at home, so. 

00:52:30
 I see. So, they are the -- that's the people that you are most -- and you live in with your mom or your -- is that what do you mean? 

00:52:40
JOHN WINSLADE I switch off and on. 

00:52:40
 You switch off and on. 

00:52:40
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

00:52:40
 Okay. So, how often, you mean the switch? 

00:52:45
JOHN WINSLADE Every week. 

00:52:45
 Every week. Okay, so you see your dad quite often. 

00:52:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And so tell me about like how those sort of, kind do you like, you said your dad sort of, came and talked to you about it or like how was that happened? 

00:53:00
 Right, my dad. Like even before the divorce, we would have family meetings. 

00:53:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:53:05
 We would gather at the dinner table and just talk about something important and all, organizing the chores or something like that. And.. 

00:53:15
JOHN WINSLADE Was that like? 

00:53:20
 Organizing the chores? 

00:53:20
JOHN WINSLADE The chores, -- I mean the meeting. 

00:53:25
 The meetings, it depends on the situation, sometimes very good, sometimes very bad, sometimes great, whatnot so. This one was the more serious one and so if he just brought it about that way something my sister and I were familiar with the meetings and then he brought up new topic. 

00:53:45
JOHN WINSLADE So, we had -- it was like dad saying, we gonna have one of your meetings. 

00:53:50
 Right. 

00:53:50
JOHN WINSLADE Right. And it's you and your sister in, anybody else, just you two? 

00:53:55
 No, my other siblings are moved down, so. 

00:53:55
JOHN WINSLADE They are moved down, okay. So what happened? 

00:54:00
 Well, we sat down like always and he just, he likes to mention like -- like recent events, so he told us like, oh, good job on the production, you know, he really enjoyed it, good job. 

00:54:20
JOHN WINSLADE He comes to the tour? 

00:54:20
 Yeah, he comes. He comes often like and talk, sound great. 

00:54:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:54:25
 He mentions our -- my good grades, I am going to be graduating soon you know... 

00:54:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:54:35
 He talks about familiar things, things we can all really doing -- feel comfortable. 

00:54:40
JOHN WINSLADE Things that you proud of you for. 

00:54:40
 Right, right and then he will say that, the reason he brought the meeting is, because he wants to introduce that topic about, his idea that it's time for him to introduce us to his new girlfriend. 

00:55:00
JOHN WINSLADE So, I guess, I'm just imagining, what was like to be you in that movement and he is kind of brining this often this meeting and carefully, it's sounds like he carefully thought out kind of way, right? He wasn't just blew it out and by the way in the car or something like that, right? 

00:55:20
 No. 

00:55:20
JOHN WINSLADE So, what's it like for you, sitting there with your dad sort of carefully thinking this through and planning this meeting and kind of approaching the topic and telling you about it and I'm gonna -- you are sitting there, what's that like in that moment? 

00:55:35
 Well, I know he is being careful, I know he wants things to turn out okay. I know that. He is actually brought into how he wants to present the topic. So, I know it's something important, I know that he wants good outcomes. So, me sitting there, I know he is expecting something and I wanna make sure that, what he is expecting comes true, I want to be correct in the way I respond. 

00:56:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Okay. 

00:56:15
 And I don't know if I'm doing that. 

00:56:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so he is expecting what do you think -- what was he expecting that you imagine at that moment that you sort of imagined he is expecting something, what was that? 

00:56:30
 Well, I thing being try to be in his situation, I think he hopes my sister and I will be okay with that, I hope no conflicts will arise, it will just be new information that we've taken and then we're ready to meet her, we're ready to be okay with it. 

00:56:55
JOHN WINSLADE So, If I can just write that down, so you would be okay with it. No conflicts will arise. 

00:57:00
 Right. 

00:57:00
JOHN WINSLADE Anything else? 

00:57:05
 I think that's the ideal outcome he would wish for. 

00:57:10
JOHN WINSLADE Right, okay. So that's what you have as a sense that he was expecting. 

00:57:15
 Right. 

00:57:15
JOHN WINSLADE And you assuming that kind of -- it sounds like little uncertain about how to respond right. So, I am wondering if you could thing about what were the -- maybe the competing thoughts that were clamoring for your attention in that moment? 

00:57:35
 Well, my honest reaction was just like, I felt uncomfortable immediately. 

00:57:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so you felt uncomfortable. 

00:57:50
 Yeah. 

00:57:50
JOHN WINSLADE About what? 

00:57:50
 I just, I don't want to talk about him and the idea of him having a girlfriend. 

00:58:00
JOHN WINSLADE And like, I mean, sort of what my -- I mean I'm not doubting that you would feel that, but I am interested in what it was that would make it something you would feel uncomfortable about talking about? 

00:58:15
  Just knowing that now this topic has been brought up I am going to have to meet her. 

00:58:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

00:58:25
 And I don't know, If I want to, I don't know. 

00:58:30
JOHN WINSLADE So, once the topic's brought out, it's kind of stop the ball rolling towards you gonna have to meet her, right? 

00:58:40
 Right. 

00:58:40
JOHN WINSLADE And you're not sure, whether you are ready to or even ever want to meet her or what?. 

00:58:45
 Right. I just, just not somebody I am want to have in my life. I want to have my parents. 

00:58:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, she is not your parent. Alright. And you don't want to have someone who comes into your family just sort of like that and somehow you suppose to be kind of like a relative instantly, is that kind of thing? Is it like that or... 

00:59:20
  I guess so, it's just -- I don't know if they are suppose to be like an incident fondness of her, I'm supposed to incidentally feel comfortable around complete stranger. 

00:59:35
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

00:59:40
 I don't know, what's expected, but for some reason, I know that instinctively, I don't want to be involved in that. I don't want to be completely familiar with the complete stranger. 

00:59:55
JOHN WINSLADE Right, right, okay. So, as my understanding is like -- it's like, you're sitting with your dad, he telling you this and it's like the expectation that your experiencing is that I don't know society or just general expectations are that you would welcome this and it's your job to do that and you should be inviting her to your life and welcoming her and treating her like, she is a member of the family or just like that and just you should be okay with that and all that kind of stuff, right? 

01:00:30
 Right. 

01:00:30
JOHN WINSLADE Anything else that kind of -- that voice of expectation would be same? 

01:00:35
  I don't know -- I guess, I don't -- the expectations would involve all that and then some sort of like happily ever after some sort of peace. 

01:00:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. happily ever after story. 

01:00:55
 Right. 

01:00:55
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. And you were thinking, hang on a second, I am not ready for happily ever after by any means, right? 

01:01:00
 Right. 

01:01:00
JOHN WINSLADE Right. you pausing there, what are you thinking? 

01:01:05
 I am thinking that, this like the happily ever after never really and never really happens like. 

01:01:20
JOHN WINSLADE It never really happens right. 

01:01:20
 No. 

01:01:20
JOHN WINSLADE Otherwise your parents wouldn't be living separately, right? 

01:01:25
 Right. 

01:01:25
JOHN WINSLADE So and the some tears that are associated with that feel, some sadness about that, right? 

01:01:35
 Right. 

01:01:35
JOHN WINSLADE So even after you like your mom and dad have been separated for a little, is it right? But this sort of little sadness that you feel about that, right? 

01:01:45
 Right. 

01:01:45
JOHN WINSLADE Because, he brought up the happily ever after story and it doesn't always kind of work as simple as that, right? 

01:01:50
 Right. 

01:01:55
JOHN WINSLADE So, what I am wondering about is, since your parents separated and divorced, how have you dealt with the situation and with the happily ever after story? Have you handled that in yourself and with your sister, you talked about that very important to you? 

01:02:20
 Right, I feel like, I feel like the situation was never really confronted. 

01:02:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:02:35
 I feel like I just, kind of, didn't want to think about it. So, I didn't really think about it. 

01:02:40
JOHN WINSLADE So, that's kind of one method you had for dealing with it was sort of, not think about it too much, right? 

01:02:45
 Right. 

01:02:50
JOHN WINSLADE And at such time, like the moment where suddenly you having to think about it more. 

01:02:55
 Right. It's being.. 

01:02:55
JOHN WINSLADE You tried not to think about, you have to think about it now. 

01:03:00
 It's being brought up again. 

01:03:00
JOHN WINSLADE It's being brought up again, right? 

01:03:00
 Right. 

01:03:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So it brings up a whole lot of things not just that the current situation, other stuff as well. 

01:03:10
 It just brings back an unpleasant. 

01:03:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, okay. 

01:03:15
 Memory or... 

01:03:20
JOHN WINSLADE So let me ask a little bit more about how you dealt with is, because what you talked about is that, what I am understood in this, because I understand in any family when something like this happens, it's actually a challenge to everybody, right? 

01:03:30
 Right. 

01:03:30
JOHN WINSLADE Not just to the parents but for the kids as well for you and your sister and your brother and other elder sister as well, right? 

01:03:40
 Right. 

01:03:40
JOHN WINSLADE And you kind of handled it by as much as you can pushing it away and not thinking about it. 

01:03:50
 Right. 

01:03:50
JOHN WINSLADE Anything else you have done, because you mentioned that you couldn't probably put it -- push it way or not think about it all the time, there must be sometime when you had to think about it, is that right? 

01:04:00
 Right. I guess just if I ever thought about I just think positively, try to be optimistic about the situation. 

01:04:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so I am interested in what do you mean by think positively, what is that for you? 

01:04:20
 I just had to think that, things are okay, like.. 

01:04:25
JOHN WINSLADE Things are okay. 

01:04:25
 Things are pretty normal. 

01:04:30
JOHN WINSLADE And you said because your mom and your dad made things okay for you.. 

01:04:40
 Right. 

01:04:40
JOHN WINSLADE Or not, or is that something you just done or what? 

01:04:45
 No, I think they have, they've provided us with the home. 

01:04:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

01:04:50
 They've staying involved in our lives. 

01:04:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:04:50
 Both equally, they've been encouraging and loving and they themselves haven't shown suffering they have, I think they are okay with the situation. So, they've helped us be okay with that. 

01:05:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So they've being involved in your lives, they've encouraging for you, they have stayed loving and they haven't shown that this is a painful to you to them and put that on you in any way, right? 

01:05:25
 Right. 

01:05:25
JOHN WINSLADE And are those things that they've done being helpful for you do you think? 

01:05:30
 Yeah, they are -- like they are role model, so, we observe them. 

01:05:35
JOHN WINSLADE Alright. 

01:05:35
 And we learned from them and -- 

01:05:40
JOHN WINSLADE So, what have you learned from them in that regard? 

01:05:40
 Well, I have learned that they've progressed and continued on with their lives even though they had about out one rough patch they were able to overcome and they had this adversity and they grew from it and... 

01:06:05
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

01:06:05
 It's great. It's a-- 

01:06:05
JOHN WINSLADE And is that something that you have taken on board for yourself as being something that you can do as well like deal with adversity, it's just adversity with some other one, isn't it? 

01:06:15
  Right, I think they've shown like you can be hopeful in any situation you can overcome and they have shown that they are examples of it. So, I feel like if they can do it and they believe I can do it, then I can do it. 

01:06:35
JOHN WINSLADE And has that been something you have to do, to deal with adversity like in the -- like I guess what I'm hearing you say is, you learned from their role modeling. 

01:06:50
 Right. 

01:06:50
JOHN WINSLADE And I am wondering whether you have to put that learning into practice in anyway either at home or school or anywhere else? 

01:07:00
 Well, I mean, they're divorced wasn't just adversity for them, it was for me too as well. 

01:07:05
JOHN WINSLADE For you too, so that's an example, if you like where you had to do with adversity too, right? 

01:07:10
 Right. 

01:07:10
JOHN WINSLADE How was that adversity for you? 

01:07:15
 Just the change and.. 

01:07:15
JOHN WINSLADE The change, yes. 

01:07:15
 The new, I learn that things don't turn out well all the time in marriages you know, I used the thing, they did. 

01:07:25
JOHN WINSLADE So you kind of always grown past the happily ever after story, right? 

01:07:35
 Right. 

01:07:35
JOHN WINSLADE And so what's the story that you have now in your mind it about marriage and family and things like that. If it's not happily ever after, what is that? 

01:07:45
 It's a, it's like uncertainty, I guess. 

01:07:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. It's uncertainty. 

01:07:55
 Right. 

01:07:55
JOHN WINSLADE And it sound like from what you said, it's an uncertainty that doesn’t completely exclude things like loving and being good role models and giving encouragement like you've benefited from those things from your parents, even though... 

01:08:20
 Even.. 

01:08:20
JOHN WINSLADE  Happily ever after story is kind of created uncertainty, right? 

01:08:25
 Right. 

01:08:30
JOHN WINSLADE So, I'm wondering, what's -- what if you called on, I am interested in like the kind of things that you say to yourself in those moment of adversity and uncertainty that helped you get through those? 

01:08:45
 Well, what helps me is knowing that something is expected like. 

01:08:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:08:55
 There is an expectation of, I mean that I will be able get through something and that helps because I know, I am not just going to do it and I was the only one who knew I could it's I wanna get through something and there is people there who also know I could and who will probably. 

01:09:15
JOHN WINSLADE It's not just you on your own, because you with other people who care about you right. And you do the same for your sister from what you see, right. 

01:09:25
 Right. 

01:09:25
JOHN WINSLADE Your part of being like there for her too, right? 

01:09:30
 Right. 

01:09:30
JOHN WINSLADE So, that helps you to get through it, to say to yourself, hang on, I'm not on my own here, I know that there are other people who doing things and caring for me and I am expecting things of me and so on, right? 

01:09:45
 Right. 

01:09:45
JOHN WINSLADE So, anything else you say to yourself has helped you get-- that has helped you get through adversity particularly the kind of adversity that we are talking about here? 

01:09:55
 Um, just I guess just other people and keeping a positive attitude. 

01:10:05
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

01:10:05
 That's why I really absorbed and other people when they go through, through something like that so. 

01:10:10
JOHN WINSLADE Right, right, right. 

01:10:10
 And it's helped me as for as.. 

01:10:15
JOHN WINSLADE It's helped you, yes. 

01:10:15
 I think so. 

01:10:15
JOHN WINSLADE So, let's take that, if we take those things, that positive attitude and kind of sense of you know, there are other people here with me and expecting things of me and I'm not on my own, kind of we can try some duties together and maintain that positive attitude. Is it relevant to this new situation that you are talking about with your dad or not? 

01:10:45
 Yeah. 

01:10:50
JOHN WINSLADE How so? 

01:10:50
 I guess, it's a new adversity that I'll get to. 

01:10:55
JOHN WINSLADE New adversity, right? 

01:11:00
 I get to overcome. Yeah. 

01:11:00
JOHN WINSLADE So, like and you know that, you say that like you believe it. 

01:11:10
 Well, I guess, yeah, I believe anything. 

01:11:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

01:11:10
 I think you can overcome anything so. 

01:11:15
JOHN WINSLADE So what I am understood and what might be your strategy for how you going to get there, because I hear the positive belief and I like to hear that it sounds important I hear a lot of sense of positive determination that I've heard you in that moment, it's actually touches me, but there's a next step, which is kind of like, how you going to implement that and practice like. 

01:11:50
 I guess I will-- I feel like I should probably behave well and well mannered. 

01:12:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So that would important to you right? 

01:12:10
 Right. 

01:12:10
JOHN WINSLADE Right is that like a value that you know, you wouldn't want to be rude to your dad's girlfriend? 

01:12:20
 Right. right. 

01:12:20
JOHN WINSLADE Am I getting that right? 

01:12:20
 Uh huh, I don't want any new conflicts to arise because of me and because of the way I.. 

01:12:30
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Before you said, your dad didn't want that, but you are saying you don't want that either, right? 

01:12:35
 Yeah, yeah, I don't want that either. 

01:12:35
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

01:12:35
 Because my dad doesn't want it, I don't want it. 

01:12:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, so why is that important? I'm not doubting it is, I'm just interested in what your thinking is, why is that important for you to be respectful and well mannered towards your dad's girlfriend? 

01:12:55
 I think it's important because it's all my dad expects and I want to make him proud, make him see that I that he's raised me well, you know. 

01:13:15
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

01:13:15
 Right. 

01:13:15
JOHN WINSLADE So it's like you would do this because you care about him, right? 

01:13:25
 Right, yeah, because I love him. 

01:13:25
JOHN WINSLADE Right. It sounds lovely. So [ 01:13:35]at the same time, you've got little -- because of uncertainty, it is not like you are going to be well mannered and not rude and respectful and those kinds of things and not being confident about, that's part of what you value, but there's also, I am sensing, it's -- from what you said before, a sense of not wanting to kind of rush things for yourself as well, right? 

01:14:00
 Right. Because... 

01:14:05
JOHN WINSLADE Tell me what that is like. 

01:14:05
 Well, I know want I want and I know what's expected, which is what I want. 

01:14:10
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

01:14:10
 But I don't know, where my thoughts or my emotions will go, that's where the uncertainty is. 

01:14:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:14:20
 And when those new feelings that I am not sure what they will be or when they will come, when those arise, that's when I am worried how am I going to deal with those, am I going to able to, you know, I guess the uncertainty is in my self-control or in those things and making I guess I am uncertain that I will make the right decisions until I make them. 

01:14:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:14:55
 And there is also a little bit of anxiety with that. 

01:14:55
JOHN WINSLADE You want kind of sort of blow it on, once or twice. 

01:15:00
 I don't know, I don't like to cry, I don't want to make a scene. 

01:15:05
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. Then you might be a human being with responses at this moment, right? Not just someone who does the things that you are expect to do, but you might has some struggle as you go through. 

01:15:25
 So, I guess that's okay. 

01:15:25
JOHN WINSLADE You think so. 

01:15:30
 Oh, yeah, it's okay to be human. 

01:15:30
 I think so too. Yeah. And if you're human and so few of these kind of emotions and responses that are human in this moment, how do you think your dad is going to respond? Would you imagine? 

01:16:00
JOHN WINSLADE Well, I think, he knows that's okay too. 

01:16:05
 You think he does? 

01:16:05
JOHN WINSLADE I think, he does. 

01:16:10
 Is there anything that you and your dad can imagine yourselves to and with kind of help prepare for this moment so that he would be, I guess I'm asking you, kind of how could you actually shape your relationship with your dad so that he wasn't taken by surprise, if you turn out to be human? you understand what I mean. 

01:16:30
JOHN WINSLADE I guess, I could talk to him about how I feel. 

01:16:35
 Right. 

01:16:40
JOHN WINSLADE A little more than you did when he on this meeting. 

01:16:45
 But I didn’t want to... 

01:16:45
JOHN WINSLADE You just taken by surprise and not able to do at that time, is that right? 

01:16:45
 Right, I didn't really say much. I said. I said, okay. I didn't say, I don't really share my feelings, so yeah. 

01:17:00
JOHN WINSLADE So, do you thing, he would open to talking to you about this? 

01:17:05
 I think, he would. 

01:17:05
JOHN WINSLADE You think he would? 

01:17:05
 Yeah. 

01:17:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, there is something you can figure out about each other, create that kind of conversation. 

01:17:20
 I guess, when I'm free and when he is free. 

01:17:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. The other decisions, I am interested in is like what about your sister because you speaking about earlier on you concerned about her in the situation as well, right? Is it the same, you concerned that she would had the same experience or is it anything different for her? 

01:17:40
 I just, I don't know how she is actually, I haven't spoken with her about her thoughts on it, but I just, I don't want to make her disappointed in me about her, I am sure she knows that I am -- she seen me, she knows that I am a good, though I am generally a good person and I don't want to disappoint her either, I mean. 

01:18:05
JOHN WINSLADE Is it like she looks up to you? 

01:18:05
 Right. 

01:18:05
JOHN WINSLADE And for that reason you don't want to be someone, she can't look after in this moment. 

01:18:15
 Right, I don't, yeah, exactly. 

01:18:20
JOHN WINSLADE And this kind of like another place and the network of your family. That kind of concerns you in this moments, like you have, to be that the sister that your younger sister would look after you. 

01:18:35
 Right. 

01:18:35
JOHN WINSLADE What kind of values would you want to showing her in the situation? 

01:18:45
 I want to show her, well, with the encounter that we are going to have, I would want to show her that I can be friendly, I can be I guess patient with anything occurs, I can be little selfless knowing that we are doing this for our dad as well, I can show her that I can be well mannered and that I can go through with that, that's like I guess me little bit of strength there. 

01:19:20
JOHN WINSLADE Right, okay so, you want to show her that strength and the respect and patience and those kind of things. And what about also the being human part, you want to see that too? 

01:19:35
 Well, I guess if I showed the being human part that I would, then I think, if she showed the human being part you know I'll let her know that that's okay. 

01:19:50
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. Okay. Do you sense that she has any of the similar kinds of thoughts and feelings that you have about this or not? 

01:20:00
 Maybe. 

01:20:00
JOHN WINSLADE Or she different in her response at that time when you had the meeting. 

01:20:05
 No, we are work kind of the same. 

01:20:05
JOHN WINSLADE Both kind of the same, so.. 

01:20:10
 Yeah, kind of similar. 

01:20:10
JOHN WINSLADE You kind of have a sense that you would have, you and she would have sort of be in a similar place or not? 

01:20:15
 Yeah. We are pretty close. We both kind of, I feel as if we both kind of kept to ourselves also we don't really talk about it you know, we don't talk about the divorce, we kind of have this mutual agreement, it just kind of like, oh it's whatever it's okay and don't worry about it. 

01:20:40
JOHN WINSLADE  But now you are in a moment, where this is leading to be addressed in some way, because your dad put it in front of you this, somehow it's a new state or new development in life, right? 

01:20:55
 Right. Yeah. And I want to behave appropriately. 

01:21:05
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

01:21:05
 Well, appropriately and then I also know that I can behave human, which -- but not always. 

01:21:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:21:10
 At first I have... 

01:21:15
JOHN WINSLADE So, this is balance of those two things. 

01:21:15
 Yeah, right. 

01:21:15
JOHN WINSLADE Is there any word, you'd use to describe that way of dealing with that, that includes both behaving appropriately and also being human, the one that bring those two things together for you? 

01:21:30
  I don't know it being -- I want to say like being genuine or sincere would like.. 

01:21:40
JOHN WINSLADE  Okay. 

01:21:45
 That would include the human part. 

01:21:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

01:21:45
 I guess, but like the appropriate like behavior, it's a character, I don't know that can be considered genuine or sincere. Well, I guess I can if I, if you have good intentions, then they are genuine and sincere. 

01:22:05
JOHN WINSLADE  That sounds sincere to me, it sounds like what I heard was a respect for relationships in your family. 

01:22:15
 Right. 

01:22:15
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

01:22:15
  Yeah. 

01:22:20
JOHN WINSLADE Despite the happily ever after story not quite being the one that you know, can see, it's actually is a true story of relationships and families or marriages or things like that. This is a more rich story in some way, am I right? Is it more complex story? 

01:22:40
 Yeah. 

01:22:40
JOHN WINSLADE And, so you gotta appropriate and you gotta being human and you're not being sincere about things that you feel and believe in and stand for. What you like to talk about this as we've been doing? 

01:23:00
 It feels good. 

01:23:05
JOHN WINSLADE Really. 

01:23:05
 Yeah. 

01:23:05
JOHN WINSLADE Why so, Andrea? What feels good about it? 

01:23:10
 Just talking I guess, sharing. 

01:23:15
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, and that makes somehow difference to the sense of uncertainty that you and comfortableness you talked about before? 

01:23:25
 Right. Like, kind of like organizing my thoughts. 

01:23:30
JOHN WINSLADE Organizing all those stuff that goes around inside. 

01:23:35
 Yeah. And then like I don't know when you organize, they kind of have a better understanding too. 

01:23:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. So, are you feeling like right now you have a little bit of a better understanding of what -- how are you going to handle this situation? 

01:23:55
 Yeah. 

01:23:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:23:55
 Yeah. 

01:24:00
JOHN WINSLADE Maybe that's a point where we can stop for today and it would be nice to check back with you, it can be checking after a little while and she have this goes, this have been -- it's great to organize and understanding for yourself right now, but then a crow fly out the window. 

01:24:15
 Right. 

01:24:15
JOHN WINSLADE Sometime in the next week, and things might surprise you, so we could check back, is that okay? 

01:24:25
 It sounds good. 

01:24:25
JOHN WINSLADE So, we can maybe -- make time and to just see how things go, you've got some big moments that hidden in the next little while from the sound of it for you, your dad and your sister and may be your mom as well. 

01:24:35
 Yeah. 

01:24:35
JOHN WINSLADE I don't know whether she comes into this, you haven't mentioned her that much, but you said, she is okay with it, right? 

01:24:45
 She's good. 

01:24:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:24:45
 Yeah. 

01:24:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Well thank you for talking to me about this, I don't know how we thinking about you and how you handle being all these things appropriate and sincere and human and dealing with the situation which has been producing uncomfortableness and uncertainty. 

01:25:05
 Yeah. 

01:25:05
JOHN WINSLADE That you kind of found, you have been kind of working and building and organizing your understanding for it. I think, I respect what you're doing. 

01:25:15
 Okay, thank you. 

01:25:20
JOHN WINSLADE Thank you. This final counseling conversation is an example of career counseling, which is conducted from a narrative prospective. That is this conductor using questions that are drawn from narrative therapy. There are some assumptions that lie behind these questions and these assumptions are drawn from a philosophical framework about personhood, which are drawn from both social constructionism and from post structuralist ideas. In particular, this approach aims to break away from essentialist ideas about personhood. In other words, I'm less interested in the nature of a person than in the stories that constitute them. Less interested in the careers that flow out of who that person is and more interested in the stories that they might embrace even once which miner stories or heavily subjugated stories because those two can be the sources of who someone might become in their career. If we only focus on essentialist ideas about personhood, we are much more likely to find careers only connected with people's --with the dominant stories of who people might be. For this reason, I don't think we can really on in career counseling, trait and factor theories or tests of attributes or inventories of people's interest. At best, at least tell one story about somebody, rather than truth about them. 

01:26:50
Trait and Factor Theory 

01:26:50
Tests of Attributes 

01:26:50
Inventories of interests 

01:26:50
JOHN WINSLADE We don't -- we miss read these outcomes of this test. If we understand them to be simple truths about who a person is. The narrative prospective would suggest that there are always other stories that can told about anyone other than the ones that trait and factor theories or tests or career tests might tell. I also in this approach want to avoid completely individualistic focus. The reason is that, I think it's inaccurate to present an impression that life in terms of careers is like a supermarket shop that you can choose whatever you want from. Actually, context of living, the people living mean that choices are much more constrains in that. Some people, of course, have far more choices in terms of career development than others do on account of privilege and of the systematic ways in which privilege is organized in society. I say that people constrains, not just out of an emphases on realism either. Realism also is misleading because it tend to suggest the one way of understanding people's lives on one story, or one narrative is the simple only story that can be told. I don't think that's true either. I'm much more interested in thinking about how people form a sense of their career. In terms of Michel Foucault idea of Care of the Self. 

01:28:15
Michel Foucault 

01:28:15
"Care of Self" 

01:28:15
JOHN WINSLADE This idea of care of the self is nothing to do with self care and an pampering oneself. It's more about designing one's life as a project. That is a project of becoming. Nobody is in the project of becoming anything in the context of total freedom. Although sometime people may have more freedom than they think they have. A freedom is not always possible because people are always shaping the individual trajectory in life of the individual project of themselves in relation to other people. That means, we always have to understand life including our careers in terms of the effects of power relations on our own ambitions and hopes and dreams. Michel Foucault talked about the disciplines involved in producing a life in terms of a project using terms he borrowed from the Einstein Stokes. They describe the disciplines as being about reflection upon experience, intentional planning of learning, activities and then a process of, what the ancient called, meditation. Nowadays, I think we think of counseling as being serving the same kind of function that they thought of as being what people did when they meditated. I also in talking about careers want to draw on some ideas that for me are important that Gilles DeLeuze, another post structuralist philosophers who is friend of Foucault developed. For DeLeuze events are logically prior to identities. And he argued a strong philosophical proof for this idea. That helped move us away from explaining things in terms of the nature of persons. That is from explaining things in terms of what this type of person might do. And this emphasis is much more towards a recognition of a multiplicity of flows through our lives. This multiplicity of flows happens through events that are connected together in a series of events or as we might say in a narrative. 

01:30:25
Reflection Upon Experience 

01:30:25
International Planning of Learning Activities 

01:30:25
Meditation 

01:30:25
Gilles DeLeuze 

01:30:25
Events are prior to identities 

01:30:25
-Shifts us from discussing the 

01:30:25
things this types of person 

01:30:25
might do. 

01:30:25
-Recognition of multiplicity of 

01:30:25
flows that run through 

01:30:25
people's lives 

01:30:25
-Gives rise to events 

01:30:25
connected in a series of 

01:30:25
events or narrative 

01:30:25
JOHN WINSLADE In order to understand this, we need to take account of what DeLeuze refers to as two different consumptions of time or two different readings of time, both that which are important, but both which serve different purposes. 

01:30:40
Gilles DeLeuze 

01:30:40
Chronos 

01:30:40
Time as broken up into 

01:30:40
distinct categories 

01:30:40
Past, Present, Future 

01:30:40
Aion 

01:30:40
A continuous line of 

01:30:40
Past, Present, Future 

01:30:40
JOHN WINSLADE One of these, he called Chronos and other one he called Aion. Chronos is an conception of time or reading of time, which breaks time up into the past, the present and the future is to think the categories of experience. The other conceptual time, Aion, sees time as a straight line that includes the past, present and the future. And in fact the movements of the past can be equally as present in the present moment or in the future as they are in the past. I think career counseling is about considering this -- the arc of time that move across the past, the present and the future. And therefore the concept of Aion is useful to locate counseling conversations in if we are to actually produce successful career counseling. This means directing attention away from just they hear and the now, which has received so much of attention in recent years in the counseling field. 

01:31:40
Here and Now 

01:31:40
A sense of Life 

01:31:40
That Arcs 

01:31:40
Through Time 

01:31:40
JOHN WINSLADE Directing attention away from this towards the sense life that arcs through time help see how particular decisions and trajectories of people in back home fit with the arc through which they see their whole life is moving rather than through just what means something and is important in the moment of the here and now. In this arc of time, the present and the past and the future are all joined up. 

01:32:10
Present 

01:32:10
Past 

01:32:10
Future 

01:32:10
JOHN WINSLADE It's all about a sense of direction, a sense of a life, not just a sense of where I am in my life right now. If forming a career direction as well articulating the future, it needs to be also about the future being connected through a person's present and to a person's past and I think that's what career counseling needs to do. It needs to be about helping people make those kind of connections and build their sense of direction. I would also add that I don't think counseling in terms of careers is only relevant to people who live middle class lives and who have high educational achievements. I think career counseling can be available for anybody because anyone can think in terms of their values and how they are constructing a life to express those values including in the work, life and then their life outside of work, what we sometimes call their leisure time. Career counseling to me needs to be much more focused on the relationship between work and life not just on a job focus. It is on the -- the point of interface between in job and life where we should be paying attention. This means that we can even can even contemplate career counseling for example for someone who is living in prison for the rest of their lives. We can ask them about the career focus and the career direction that they wanting to have. The kind of person that they wanting to become or we can be talking with this old mother looking after young children who has little prospect of being able to find the times or find work at this particular moment in her life. She still can think about her career or we can meet an alcoholic living on the street who is homeless, and still talk about the career direction that that person wants to follow. The arc of life and how that the things that are happening to them in that moment in their lives, life fit into the arc that they're trying to create. That is the person that they are trying to become. So, I want to show you an example of a career conversation that doesn't include all of those things. But that might be in -- just one example of something that puts these principles into practice. I don't want to pretend that this example is a perfect one or even a typical one. It's just an example. My invitation to you as you listen to it however, is to listen for the intention behind the questions, listen to the assumptions on which these questions are built and listen to the narrative of the arc of a person's life that is being created as the client in this conversation talks about the prospects for her career. So, let's turn now to watch this video. Thank you. So, Canberra, nice to see you. 

01:35:05
 Nice to meet you. 

01:35:10
JOHN WINSLADE (inaudible ) watching the show the other week and I remember you were in the Bye Bye Birdie production, right? 

01:35:15
 Yes, I was. 

01:35:20
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, was that fun? 

01:35:20
 It was really fun. I enjoyed it. 

01:35:20
JOHN WINSLADE It look like you're very much having fun. 

01:35:20
 Yeah. 

01:35:25
JOHN WINSLADE So, that's something that like -- my understanding is that we need to sort of talk about where you are heading in terms of your career and life direction or that kind of stuff, right? 

01:35:35
 Yes, definitely. 

01:35:35
JOHN WINSLADE So, I'm curious just as the starting point, is the drama and is that important in terms of what we are talking about or is that one part of it or what? 

01:35:45
 Yeah, it really is part of it for me. Well, I absolutely love theatre and I think it’s a passion of mine, but it's kind of hard because I am also good at academic things and some people think that acting isn't a very profitable career and it's hard to get into, and so, I don't know... 

01:36:05
JOHN WINSLADE Especially out of (inaudible ). 

01:36:10
 Exactly, and so I don't know if I should try to pursue that or if I should just have it be a hobby. 

01:36:15
JOHN WINSLADE A hobby, okay, yeah. So, it's kind of one of the things, it's kind of -- it like a question that's on your mouth at this moment, right? 

01:36:25
 Yeah. 

01:36:25
JOHN WINSLADE Should I pursue this or should it be a hobby, right. 

01:36:25
 Exactly. 

01:36:25
JOHN WINSLADE This is going to be important to you one way or another, it just the question of which one. 

01:36:30
 Yes. 

01:36:30
JOHN WINSLADE So, you are also saying that you have other areas of academic interest that you have, tell me about that little bit? 

01:36:40
 Yeah, I am also, I am questioning if I should be a psychologist or lawyer or an English major or History teacher. 

01:36:50
JOHN WINSLADE Psychologist, lawyer, English major or history teacher. 

01:36:55
 Or history teacher, yeah. 

01:37:00
JOHN WINSLADE Yes, you got a number of things, number of balls in the air, right? 

01:37:00
 Yes. 

01:37:00
JOHN WINSLADE That's fine, right. And you're at a point, where you still got plenty of time figure out, which one of those is going to be the top for you, all four, right? 

01:37:10
 Well, kind of, I am going into my senior year and so I have to kind of pick my majors for applications for universities. 

01:37:20
JOHN WINSLADE Right. So, that's kind of way you're feeling like the world is saying Canberra, you've got to make some choices. 

01:37:30
 Yes, definitely. 

01:37:30
JOHN WINSLADE How do you explain the world's saying is to you, like does it? 

01:37:35
 Well, it's kind of difficult, because I have a lot of, I am one of the first people who I was face a little bit more ambitious. I look my family like I want to get -- I'm a doctor, be it a Juris Doctor or a PhD and I am and so lot of my family kind of brags it out me. And so, I feel like there is a lot of pressure on me to choose the right decision and I am kind of worry like if I become a psychologist, but I could have been really great English teacher or like something like I might choose a wrong thing. 

01:38:15
JOHN WINSLADE You want to choose a wrong thing because of everybody's expectations. 

01:38:20
 Not because of everybody's expectations, but I don't want them to influence me and I don't want to miss out on an opportunity that I could have had. 

01:38:30
JOHN WINSLADE How about that happen, how would you miss out? 

01:38:30
 How? 

01:38:30
JOHN WINSLADE How will missing out be like? 

01:38:30
  Well, obviously it takes a lot of time and effort and money, if I've been to a major or you know entering a career and I don't want to dedicate all my time to doing like this thing, if I should have been spending in doing this thing. 

01:38:45
JOHN WINSLADE I see. 

01:38:45
 So. 

01:38:50
JOHN WINSLADE Is there any sense of other people wanting you to be in any of these things. 

01:38:55
 Well, my family doesn't really care, I mean they don't really care I do as long as I am happy and I am successful at it. I know like, I've used to really wanted to be an actress and just an actress and they're like, oh, you never gonna make any money, probably it's going to be a waitress for 20 year or so. 

01:39:20
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, that one message that you've been given. 

01:39:25
 Yes. 

01:39:25
JOHN WINSLADE Any others? 

01:39:25
 Well, not really any others, it is just it's like all my teachers because I get good grades, I mean I advance soon, and so it's like all my teacher and the subjects that I am good at, they're like, oh you're going to go into this. Since I have lot different people thinking I am going in a lot of different directions. 

01:39:45
JOHN WINSLADE So, they have a kind of plans for you in terms of what they are interested in, right? 

01:39:50
 Yeah, exactly. 

01:39:50
JOHN WINSLADE And you gotta figure out which is your field of interest. 

01:39:50
 Yes. 

01:39:55
JOHN WINSLADE And your ambitions are gonna -- rather than their interest for you. 

01:40:00
 Absolutely, yes. 

01:40:00
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, I mean I asked that Canberra because often people talk about careers as if this sort of total choice like a choosing things off a supermarket shelf, you know? 

01:40:15
 Yes. 

01:40:15
JOHN WINSLADE But it isn’t really like that, it is often much more constrained in that and many times people are pushing you in various directions and you don’t have -- it's not like your parent are trying to warning you to become one thing are another but they've got ideas of their own, so your teachers, right? 

01:40:30
 Yes, yes. 

01:40:30
JOHN WINSLADE What about friends? Do you have friends, who have thoughts about things that influence you as well? 

01:40:35
 Well, I mean, not exactly but I mean they do support me in a lot of things and I definitely feel like even if I’m not influenced by them, I think that well there is a lot of also, competition between my fellow students and my fellow theater students and so, I don’t know, there is – there is like a subtle competition kind of, if we're both trying to maybe get into this major and like we're both trying to be the best in like English class or something that it kind of influences you little bit in that way like. So... 

01:41:10
JOHN WINSLADE Right, right. So, that kind of – a sort of rivalry competition was there, they can have an influence, if you like. 

01:41:20
 Yeah. 

01:41:20
JOHN WINSLADE What sort of influence do they have on you – on your thinking, in your decision making. 

01:41:25
 On me, I don’t think it really directly influences me that much, it’s just it’s a little bit more of hindrance like in a sense that, like if I mean in advanced placement class, and it’s for history like I ended the year with the B because it’s really hard class, but some of my friends ended the year with an A. And I know what you -- it's kind of interested maybe be in a historian or history major. 

01:41:55
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

01:41:55
 They don’t want to do that, but I'm like, oh, well, I won't be able to do that because they were the ones who got an A. 

01:42:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, like the common comparison almost. 

01:42:10
 Yeah, exactly. 

01:42:10
JOHN WINSLADE Raises a question in your mind about whether I can. 

01:42:15
 Yeah. 

01:42:15
JOHN WINSLADE Be the right person to do this or what. 

01:42:15
 Exactly yeah. 

01:42:20
JOHN WINSLADE So, when that question arises, you know, when that question somehow pokes his nose into your head, do you have an answer for it? 

01:42:30
 Um, well normally, I just -- I plan doing whatever makes me happy I think. 

01:42:40
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, yeah. 

01:42:40
 So, it doesn't influence me too much, it just a little bit of a nag but. 

01:42:45
JOHN WINSLADE Right, so you don’t let it influence you. 

01:42:45
 No, I try not to, yeah. 

01:42:50
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, very good. When you think about the various options that you've talked about, the history major the lawyer, the actor, the English major -- Historian, I should say or English major leading to what being an English. 

01:43:10
 Well, if I got any of those majors I could, Juris Doctor. 

01:43:20
JOHN WINSLADE Right. 

01:43:20
 So. 

01:43:20
JOHN WINSLADE So all of that -- could all lead to that. 

01:43:20
 Yeah, (crosstalk) all lead to ultimately being an attorney, so.. 

01:43:20
JOHN WINSLADE Right, okay. So that's kind of pull that attorney idea, right. 

01:43:25
 Yes. 

01:43:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. How come that’s -- what's attractive about that to you, I'm interested to know what pulls you in that direction. 

01:43:30
 Well, I really will like debating and I’m interested in politics. 

01:43:35
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:43:40
 And I’m sometimes I toy with the idea of possibly be a politician or running for something in the future, so.. 

01:43:45
JOHN WINSLADE Right. So, this is sort of, but further down the track, you kind of, as you look at ahead in your life, you can see, first of all your major. 

01:43:55
 Yes. 

01:43:55
JOHN WINSLADE And the university that you want to go to and you gotta make that decision and respond to these kind of... 

01:44:00
 Yes. 

01:44:00
JOHN WINSLADE The world says you're now a senior and you gonna have to make these decisions, right? 

01:44:05
 Yes, yes. 

01:44:05
JOHN WINSLADE In applications. And then it’s the kind of the JD degree after that. And then there's the kind of future that that might to lead to in, none of things are all cast in stone yet. 

01:44:15
 Yes. 

01:44:15
JOHN WINSLADE But they are so beckoning somewhere in the future, right? 

01:44:20
 Yeah. 

01:44:20
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. So, when you think about yourself, I don’t know you choose which one of those places, when you think about that any of those places, how do you see yourself being there either as a completing a major or doing the JD, or being a lawyer or being a politician or whatever it might be, what? 

01:44:45
 What do you mean? 

01:44:45
JOHN WINSLADE Oh, like when you imagine, I'm just inviting you to picture yourself in any one of those places. And I am wondering what you see, what you see yourself being like and doing and... 

01:44:55
 Yeah, well I think I would be very satisfied doing any of those things, because I love all of them. 

01:45:05
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:45:05
 And, yeah, so I love all of them and so since I know that I would probably be happy with, whatever I'd choose, it just kind of figuring out which one I want to do most. So.. 

01:45:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:45:15
 Yeah. 

01:45:15
JOHN WINSLADE So, okay, so they all have an appeal that close to you. 

01:45:20
 Yeah. 

01:45:25
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, and the images that you that come to your mind about yourself doing any of those thing all sound kind of pretty positive, right? 

01:45:30
 Yes, yeah, they are. 

01:45:35
JOHN WINSLADE Appealing, right? 

01:45:35
 Yeah. 

01:45:35
JOHN WINSLADE Let’s see. Do you see any kind of barriers are constraints that might hold you back or that might exist in the world outside you that would say, Canberra, we're not going to make it so easy for you? 

01:45:55
 Oh, definitely, there's hindrances with anything, I think that out of all that prospects, I think the most difficult one for me would be theater. I love theater, but I like it because it's kind of a challenge for me like a – I like my theater class, because I’ve always been an AP student and when I entered school, I listen only thing that I really like doing even though I didn’t necessarily like pick up to it immediately. I like it because it's a challenge but regard what I think that it might be hard as a major also because there is –it’s a very big field, you know on both stage and film and so if I did do that and I theoretically did, like get a major in it or try to pursue professionally, I would have a lot of competition for auditions and such. So... 

01:46:50
JOHN WINSLADE Right. So the biggest barrier would be the competition. 

01:46:55
 I think so. Yeah. 

01:46:55
JOHN WINSLADE So that would be the biggest challenge to overcome, right. 

01:46:55
 Yeah. 

01:47:00
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, okay. So any challenges in the other fields? 

01:47:05
  Not that I really seen, I mean I's sure there are, I can't -- the only one that I can really think about is the theater one. 

01:47:15
JOHN WINSLADE Right. Okay. You know, I mean I asked about that because, no, because I'm wondering if you would look at challenges and barriers and give up. 

01:47:25
 Yeah. 

01:47:25
JOHN WINSLADE Because I think it’s important to kind of know those things and to think about what you can have to work with and overcome and those kind of things. 

01:47:30
 Yeah, absolutely. 

01:47:30
JOHN WINSLADE I mean, you think about acting, the one of the things you'd have to overcome would be the intensity of the competition for auditions and things like that, right? 

01:47:40
 Yeah, it is. 

01:47:45
JOHN WINSLADE Um, so, um, I guess what I’m wanting to ask you about is, when you think about each of those pathways, how are you going to in the near future-- I'm thinking of your kind of senior -- beginning of your senior year right. How you thinking about, how you will kind of cultivate the beginnings of that pathway? How will you take those steps. 

01:48:20
 Yeah. Well, I – I’m going to look into double majoring. And so basically what I think... 

01:48:30
JOHN WINSLADE That if you've two options open to certify, right? 

01:48:35
 Yeah, yeah. So, what I am planning on doing right now is, I am planning on looking into like, which universities I'm gonna go to and like talking to some of my teachers about that stuff when senior year comes and then see if I could theoretically double major and double minor. So.. 

01:48:50
JOHN WINSLADE Double major and double minor. 

01:48:50
 Yeah. 

01:48:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:48:55
 Should be a lot of time, but... 

01:48:55
JOHN WINSLADE This is part of your sense of ambition right? You don't wanna kind of (crosstalk), right? 

01:49:00
 Yeah, because that I could kind of do everything, so.. 

01:49:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so what would be the two that you choose with the double major, if you have kind of -- would you have to decide that now. 

01:49:10
 Well, as of today, as of today, I would double major in history and theater with the double minor in English and Psychology and then in Juris Doctor. 

01:49:25
JOHN WINSLADE Right then you have the JD would be your option of college you graduate, so. 

01:49:30
 Yes, absolutely. 

01:49:30
JOHN WINSLADE And that would have a quite a few of those possibilities, right? 

01:49:35
 Yeah. Because then, I wouldn’t really have to choose. 

01:49:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. Or eventually you would, but not immediately. 

01:49:45
 Yeah, exactly. 

01:49:45
JOHN WINSLADE So when you think about it, you are thinking about delaying the choice a little bit as much as you can, right? 

01:49:55
 Well, not necessarily delaying, but I want to have the opportunity to learn as much as I can. So.. 

01:50:00
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah, delaying is not the right word then, that’s keeping the opportunities alive always. 

01:50:05
 Yeah. And then, it is not really for our career focal point, it's more discuss I want a better myself and I want to focus more on learning and things that I want to learn. 

01:50:10
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so it's not just that I’m looking to reach that objective down the road, I'm actually going to spend time enjoying what I’m doing and appreciating and valuing it now. 

01:50:25
 Yes. 

01:50:25
JOHN WINSLADE And how would you do that as a senior? 

01:50:30
 As a senior, I hope to really focus on my classes more than I ever had before, I just I want a really be committed to my last year of high school. So that, I can really appreciate it because all my friends here in college stay that it’s so easy in comparison. So I just I wanted to just live in present so. 

01:50:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So value and appreciate it as much as you can. 

01:50:50
 Yes, absolutely. 

01:50:55
JOHN WINSLADE Is there -- and you are saying more than I have like this year, is that what you mean? 

01:51:00
 Well, this year, I tried hard, like freshmen year, I still didn't really get the whole high school thing, so that was little immature. 

01:51:05
JOHN WINSLADE Just worked their way into these things. 

01:51:10
 Yes. Well, I’m just try really hard because this is my last year. So. 

01:51:10
 All right. So then like, is that important to you just to have a point of you a self satisfaction. 

01:51:20
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

01:51:20
 Things like that. Because I got 4.0 this year and I want to have 4.5 next year. 

01:51:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, you’ve got a goal. 

01:51:25
 Yeah, I have a goal. 

01:51:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So you got a goal, and you got some ideas about what you are need to do to help you achieve that goal, right? 

01:51:35
 Yeah. 

01:51:35
JOHN WINSLADE This is kind of make the most of that and value each of the opportunities that you have. 

01:51:40
 Yes. 

01:51:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, Um, as you plan to do that, what I’m wondering about is what source of things do you need to hold to you or hold close to you or hold to be important and not lose sight of or lose track of that would help you to do that through your senior year? 

01:52:10
 Definitely to just keep focusing on not procrastinating and I'd really focus on talking to my teachers and talking others who've like been in those fields and so I can get advice from them. So, I think that will be helpful. 

01:52:25
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, not procrastinating, tell me what you mean by that. 

01:52:30
 Well, I always procrastinate. 

01:52:35
JOHN WINSLADE Do you? 

01:52:35
 Yeah, like. Because I'm one of those people that always does like homework assignments the night before. 

01:52:40
JOHN WINSLADE The night before, okay. 

01:52:40
 I still get A's on them but it's just (crosstalk). 

01:52:45
JOHN WINSLADE It's a hard way to do it. 

01:52:45
 Yeah. 

01:52:45
JOHN WINSLADE So, how will you do that differently. 

01:52:50
 I would probably, just try to be better at time management. 

01:52:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:52:55
 I’m going be in a lot of different classes next year, but I still hope that I can really organize my time and. 

01:53:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:53:05
 Just prioritize home work before friends or other things so. 

01:53:05
JOHN WINSLADE Right. So, and so you got all this with your hand, organize my time. Like you had a – kind of allocate it, you know, this, this and here and here, right? 

01:53:20
 Yes. 

01:53:20
JOHN WINSLADE And tell me about prioritizing, getting the work done ahead of just spending time with your friends? 

01:53:30
 Yes. Yeah, I think that’s important. 

01:53:30
JOHN WINSLADE That’s important to you. 

01:53:30
 Yeah, that is important too, but more or like that can be weekend thing and that homework should be a week day thing. 

01:53:40
JOHN WINSLADE So, that's one of the prioritizing decisions that you are making, is that different from what you did it as a junior or not? 

01:53:45
 Not different from what did as a junior, but different from what I did as sophomore. 

01:53:50
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:53:50
 Sophomore, I was a little bit sleeky on something so. 

01:53:55
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So, I guess I'm thinking about values and principles and I think you already speaking to them but values that will kind of sustain you to get through to the goals that you laying out, which are quite specific and quite clear, even though you've got decisions to make about which way to go, you still got ideas about where they will lead, What do you think it's going to enable you to achieve those in terms of value systems, principles of thinking about life or whatever? 

01:54:40
 Oh, I think, it's really important to be optimistic and to be determined and to persevere, even if you are kind of in a difficult situation. Um, so, I don’t know those are what I always value. 

01:54:55
JOHN WINSLADE Optimistic. 

01:54:55
 Optimistic and perseverance. 

01:55:00
JOHN WINSLADE And perseverance. 

01:55:00
 Yes. 

01:55:00
JOHN WINSLADE Yeah. 

01:55:00
 And being determined. 

01:55:00
JOHN WINSLADE And being determined, right? 

01:55:05
 Yes. 

01:55:05
JOHN WINSLADE So where are those-- where do you find yourself having those values and expressing them in your life right now. 

01:55:15
 Well for optimism, I don't really try to just focus on the positive of things not in a necessarily naive way. I just think that it's important to avoid cliches, but I think it is important to just find the positive in a situation, because if you're in -- your life is a lot easier if you don't put a negativity on yourself. 

01:55:40
JOHN WINSLADE Okay and avoiding cliches, you mean other value, right. 

01:55:40
 Yes, absolutely. 

01:55:45
JOHN WINSLADE Okay, so if I was asked you could you tell me a story of when you had done that? 

01:55:50
 Well, let's see optimism, well, for-- yes. When I was in psychology last year, which is an AP class, I’m -- the first semester, I was thinking about dropping out because I had, like a B minus, which I' not use to getting and um, and I wasn’t doing like my homework and I wasn't reading the book and stuff. And I thought that, I should just drop out because I didn’t want to get a bad score on my B test, which was next semester, but I thought that I can just keep doing it, so I tried really hard and I just focused on staying positive and looking at it in a different way as something that I had an opportunity to learn instead of like a -- kind of punishment for like something that I would necessary enjoy. 

01:56:45
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

01:56:45
 And then, so the second semester, I just try to really enjoy it and see all of the things that I liked about it and how much I love to learning it and then I got a 5 on the AP test and so, I think optimism definitely helps in situation, where you don't really know what to do. 

01:57:00
JOHN WINSLADE Um, I’m wondering, whether that story also applies to determination, doesn't it? 

01:57:05
 Yeah. 

01:57:05
JOHN WINSLADE For perseverance. 

01:57:05
 Yeah, I think it does. 

01:57:10
JOHN WINSLADE It sounds like, it speaks to all of those things. 

01:57:10
 Yes, absolutely. 

01:57:10
JOHN WINSLADE So, what did you learn from that class? 

01:57:15
 From where? 

01:57:15
JOHN WINSLADE From your experience of that class, that psychology class? 

01:57:20
 What about it? 

01:57:20
JOHN WINSLADE I don't mean, what did you learn in the class and what you -- 

01:57:25
 Oh, what did I learn from that experience? 

01:57:25
JOHN WINSLADE From the experience, if you like. 

01:57:25
 Oh, well, I think that, well like it's helping me because I've already made my class list for senior year. 

01:57:35
JOHN WINSLADE Yes. 

01:57:35
 And originally I was only going to take, for the social science of senior year, you can either take advanced placement government or advanced placement economics and I was originally just trying to do one but now I'm doing two because I think that, I can use those skills that I learned in persevering with -- if psychology that I can get through both of those classes next year. 

01:58:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So that's helped you to develop the sense of belief that you can do those classes and rather than being frightened of them, you kind of welcomed the challenge. 

01:58:15
 Absolutely, yes. 

01:58:15
JOHN WINSLADE It helped very much. 

01:58:15
 Yeah. 

01:58:15
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So let me ask you to do this, Canberra. Put yourself a little bit down the trait. Let’s say, at the end of your bachelors degree, and you are looking back, what are you thinking as you look back that you would be most proud of that helped you to get to that point? 

01:58:45
 I hope, I would just be proud of how hard I've tried and and just not given up and continuing to pursue what I want to pursue. 

01:59:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. And, if I'm put it one other little way, what would you think that -- how the people who care about you will be looking at you at that point and being proud of? 

01:59:10
 Hopefully the same values, hopefully. 

01:59:15
JOHN WINSLADE The same things. 

01:59:15
 Yeah, hopefully they can see that I have continue to kept through college and do something that's kind of difficult, just because I wanted so. 

01:59:25
JOHN WINSLADE All right, yeah. And would that also apply to when you got your JD at the... 

01:59:30
 Yes, absolutely. 

01:59:30
JOHN WINSLADE Looking back at that point? 

01:59:30
 Yes. 

01:59:30
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. 

01:59:30
 I think so. 

01:59:35
JOHN WINSLADE So, I’m – it seems to me that you’ve got what you need to have in mind right now in terms of the near future and the decisions that you going to need to make about applications for university. 

01:59:50
 Yes. 

01:59:50
JOHN WINSLADE You've got some clear goals in mind, you haven’t got final decision about what your majors going to like, but that’s still okay, because there is plenty of time, right? 

02:00:00
 Yes. 

02:00:05
JOHN WINSLADE And you’ve also got ideas about where your life is leading and what is going to be important to you in your professional life. 

02:00:15
 Yes. 

02:00:15
JOHN WINSLADE Without that being absolutely specific, but there's a lot of time -- there's plenty of time to figure that out. 

02:00:25
 Yes, definitely. 

02:00:25
JOHN WINSLADE So, one last thing I am interested in asking and that is kind of what’s – what’s your experience of sort of thinking about and talking about these things right now as we talk about? 

02:00:35
 What do you mean? 

02:00:35
JOHN WINSLADE What does having this conversation mean to you? 

02:00:40
 Oh, I think it’s just, for me, things that I already want to pursue and I think it all just-- I think it’s helped me remember to just to keep constantly question myself and making sure what I want to do. 

02:01:00
JOHN WINSLADE Okay. So it’s kind of a framing what you’ve been thinking, talk out loud and speak about it. 

02:01:10
 Yeah. 

02:01:10
JOHN WINSLADE And it's also, you are going to take away from this -- if I understand you rightly, some questioning, some ongoing questioning that’s... 

02:01:20
 Yeah, just to ask myself, yeah 

02:01:20
JOHN WINSLADE To keep asking yourself, right? 

02:01:20
 Yeah, of course, because people can change their mind so. 

02:01:25
JOHN WINSLADE Absolutely, of course they can. 

02:01:30
 Yeah. 

02:01:30
JOHN WINSLADE And, things happen and some things, you meet people who will inspire you and all kinds of thing. 

02:01:35
 Yeah, absolutely, yes. 

02:01:40
JOHN WINSLADE And I certainly wish that for you Canberra and I look forward to some point hearing about where your journey is taking you.
