00:00:40
NARRATOR Crouch End in London has been my home for 10 years. On the next street, where I live there is a very different type of home for those suffering with mental illness. 

00:00:50
TAMSIN You're coming to Crisis Centre and it's ours. This is where we live it with a… 

00:00:55
NARRATOR One in four of us will have mental health problems and for those that end up with the Crisis Centre it's often at last results. For many like Tamsin, this is the only alternative to be in locked up on a psychiatric ward. 

00:01:15
TAMSIN Normally, if you are in mental health there is a kind of build up to it or you have a break down or something like that and even then you got to build up. Mine wasn't, I just dropped on, on February, the 7th, umm… nearly three years going now and that was it from that very moment the whole, my whole world changed. And more, many thing I feel an encumbrance to other people. 

00:01:45
DANIELLE Mm-hmm, will you? You okay? 

00:01:50
NARRATOR Tamsin has fits everyday. And before being been forth (ph) to the Arbours Crisis Centre, she was in hospital for two years. 

00:02:00
[sil.] 

00:02:05
NARRATOR As no physical course is being found. The therapist here want to explore any psychological reasons that might trigger these fits. 

00:02:15
[sil.] 

00:02:20
DANIELLE Anyway you back hold her. Come, let's, let's go into the lounge, Tamsin. 

00:02:25
TAMSIN Do you wait then? 

00:02:30
DANIELLE I know you'll make out. 

00:02:30
KATE That's Teddy. 

00:02:35
TAMSIN Umm… my legs aren't working? My legs aren't working? 

00:02:40
DANIELLE Okay, here you go, up on those legs, up on the legs. 

00:02:40
TAMSIN They are not doing 

00:02:45
DANIELLE Yes, come on. 

00:02:45
TAMSIN Make them work? 

00:02:45
DANIELLE Let's do something incredible. 

00:02:45
KATE Want some therapy? 

00:02:50
DANIELLE Yeah. 

00:02:50
KATE One, two… okay. 

00:02:55
NARRATOR Many who come here are suffering with sever emotional distress. It's hopes to intensive therapy they may gain some insight into their difficulties. 

00:03:05
DANIELLE Okay. 

00:03:10
NARRATOR Also psychotherapist, Louis Allio(ph) will explore why Tamsin's emotions are making her physically ill. 

00:03:15
LOUIS You know, the Crisis Centre, we are trying to help people to embark a major change. I mean, I'm thinking for Tamsin, yes, it is about helping her to try make things different. If somebody can understand their thoughts and feelings then that need itself effect change. 

00:03:40
NARRATOR The Arbours Crisis Centre was founded by Dr. Joseph Berke in the 1970s, as an alternative to psychiatric hospital where patients are off under lock and key. 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN Sit please. 

00:03:55
TAMSIN And It looks like a frog glide, he's got a big smile. 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN Oh no. 

00:03:55
NARRATOR No one here is locked up. And this is the only place in Britain where the therapists live in the same house as their patients. 

00:04:05
[sil.] 

00:04:25
NARRATOR Even today this is an unconventional approach to care. 

00:04:25
TAMSIN You're sitting. 

00:04:25
JOSEPH BERKE Sit there. 

00:04:25
TAMSIN Sit. 

00:04:30
JOSEPH BERKE (inaudible ) to the dog. 

00:04:31
TAMSIN Beautiful. 

00:04:35
UNKNOWN Tamsin? 

00:04:40
[music] 

00:04:45
TAMSIN It's pretty much my room in… honesty my opinion is space, I've got a nice little (inaudible ) my desk and everything. And also why I happen to sleep down because I feel very safe very much, safer down there then anything else. 

00:05:00
NARRATOR Patients at the Crisis Centre are called guest in a ethoed to reduced the stigma. Although the Centre can take up to six people, Tamsin is the only guest. Many like Tamsin come here from psychiatric hospital and this may be the last chance to get life back on track. During their stay, they'll be asked to take part in house meetings as what is though individual therapy, three times a week. 

00:05:30
LOUIS What we're doing here is asking you to embark on something that you don't know but though it's good feel not. That in some ways, you have spent most of the last twenty years trying not to have feelings and we're now turning around to you and saying, actually we want you to help, we want to help you have your feelings. 

00:06:00
TAMSIN Feelings just make mess of things. Why can't we just stop the feelings? Are there will be fine, do with the psychotherapy, know the rights we are backing, get down with the life at same time. 

00:06:10
LOUIS Yeah, this is so something that one morning it could wakeup and it's gonna be okay. Now this is something very profound, very long term. 

00:06:20
TAMSIN (inaudible ) had the fits I have never winded up him into health. When do I gets be normal again 

00:06:25
LOUIS I have no idea. 

00:06:30
NARRATOR Before Tamsin became ill. She was training to be a teacher. I'm keen to know what happened three years ago to change her life so dramatically. 

00:06:45
TAMSIN I was (inaudible ) 24 hours a day. I manage to live (inaudible ) better to speak and it has speech therapy and learnt to speak will (inaudible ) I'm. I was in a wheelchair for nearly six months. The very day, I clap so first senile (ph) was with my teddy. I don't know anymore whether it's psychological, physiological, what it is. I think it's probably becoming X with the (inaudible ). 

00:07:15
DANIELLE Okay, come on, come on, come on… 

00:07:20
LOUIS For myself, I, I think it is psychological. When she gets over round emotionally, she cuts off, almost like escaping from something that has become unbearable. There is a reason why feelings get pushed down. Umm… and this is because they can't bear them. So what we are asking people to do here is the unbearable, although she feels worse because the feelings are starting to come up. Well, that means, is there, there is a potential that she can have a life in the future. And I think that, you know, without this happening I, I'm not sure that she can. 

00:08:00
[music] 

00:08:05
NARRATOR The next time I visit the house things have deteriorated. Tamsin has been sleepwalking and was found by a stranger before this morning. One of the resident therapist, Kate waits for her return. 

00:08:20
KATE She is trying to tell us something by doing this. Somehow we've got to build time to find out what's going on. She must be feeling, uh, such dispel. 

00:08:35
NARRATOR Danielle another of the resident therapist returns from hospital with Tamsin. 

00:08:45
KATE No, Tamsin. Oh, uh… 

00:08:50
[sil.] 

00:08:55
KATE We are going to prepare a nice cappuccino chocolate for you, Tamsin. 

00:09:00
[sil.] 

00:09:15
KATE Tamsin, its teddy. 

00:09:20
[sil.] 

00:09:25
NARRATOR The therapist's believe there is a cause for Tamsin sleepwalking. And only by understanding this will Tamsin have any real chance of controlling her behavior. 

00:09:35
KATE I've spoke to her mom and her mom said to me why can't we prep a lock on the door, so she can't do this. Now, it's time to explain them we are not. 

00:09:45
DANIELLE But it is not the way we work. 

00:09:45
KATE It's not way we work and we are not a psychiatric hospital, and the alternative is Tamsin just being locked on a wards like this so not going no where. 

00:09:55
DANIELLE Hmm. 

00:10:00
NARRATOR In order to make sense of the guest behavior the resident therapist are supported by a team of psychotherapist like Louis who meet every week. 

00:10:10
LOUIS I think we can't understand why Tamsin was found clamped in the street today, because we had a meeting yesterday. What we talked about was about the family work. I teach something that she needs what we feel is important about the work. She was absolutely that she didn't wanted to go ahead. That if it's a condition of the stay that she, she wants to live her life stopped. You know, so if I'm, I have to keep reminding myself, she is 29. She can't continue her live until she resolves something for herself. It is meant fully extremely and she is this. I mean this is the one thing I guess that could preclude Tamsin from being here with Crisis Centre. If she continues to sleepwalking this way, I don't know whether we can, we cannot have her here. We've said right from the beginning from that the very initial consultation that we felt an important part of the work, most gonna be family work. Tamsin isn't gonna be able to take any step forward until she can disentangle herself a bit, you know, so from her family. 

00:11:20
NARRATOR By meeting with the family, Louis hopes they can help her to gain further insight into some of Tamsin's difficulties. When I first meet Tamsin's parents, I'm interested to find out what they think is happening with their daughter. 

00:11:35
UNKNOWN I have no idea what they are doing there. 

00:11:40
UNKNOWN They have only told us its intensive therapy. But they've never explained to us what that therapy consists of. After entering, she is worse now then when she first went in. And they've never addressed the problem. 

00:11:55
UNKNOWN They're just threatening if I'm going this times now because… you know, these are the places we found your daughter or you know… 

00:12:05
UNKNOWN One least day, who will be there identifying her? 

00:12:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, that's the biggest worry. 

00:12:05
UNKNOWN That's the biggest worry. 

00:12:10
UNKNOWN I said this to the Arbours last time, and… 

00:12:10
UNKNOWN Nobody is gonna check on her. 

00:12:10
UNKNOWN And if she is suppose to be in a protective environment. Is she? I don't know. We told that's what it is but as far as I can see him as well, sleeping in the car park and then when I said to them why can't you lock the door? Oh, no our guests, our guests so free to come and go when they like themselves, what she told. They are not coming with any other word to describe it except a nightmare. 

00:12:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's a nightmare. 

00:12:35
[music] 

00:12:40
DANIELLE The night, that's when all the feels come, you know, you don't want to be alone in night. You know, it's unbearable to live with yourself. That doors are locked. Time to go. Hopefully to a goodnight sleep. 

00:13:00
[sil.] 

00:13:05
NARRATOR I'm staying at the Centre but I'm woken in the middle of the night by Tamsin. Danielle is desperately trying to stop her from getting out of the house. 

00:13:15
TAMSIN I will go. I will, so die. I will, I will, I will go forget now. 

00:13:20
DANIELLE Okay, okay, come and sit in the lounge with me. Come on, come on, come I will tell you something. Come. 

00:13:30
[sil.] 

00:13:35
TAMSIN I hope to get out or else I should die. I know probably because should… 

00:13:45
[sil.] 

00:13:50
DANIELLE She say, she wants to go, she wants to get out. I think it's some not wanted to get out from Crisis Centre but, umm… I want to get out, may be myself. 

00:14:05
[sil.] 

00:14:10
DANIELLE I know… 

00:14:15
[sil.] 

00:14:25
DANIELLE Tamsin, Tamsin, Tamsin… coming to the house meeting with us? Come from under the table. 

00:14:30
NARRATOR Tamsin hasn't spoken a word and she started sleepwalking. 

00:14:35
DANIELLE Come let's go. 

00:14:35
NARRATOR I find it difficult to see her like this. 

00:14:40
DANIELLE Good, good, let's go. Here we go. 

00:14:45
LOUIS This isn't big surprise it is very frightening to see Tamsin in such a fragmented state. Quite often hospital if somebody is distressed yeah, they give a medication and here we don't do that. Emotional pain is seen as an illness. And, and it's not, an emotional pain is part of being human. I'm not saying we encourage people to be distress but we're not frightened of that distress and I think that's the difference. 

00:15:15
[sil.] 

00:15:20
KATE We may need time and start talking Tamsin and all of us. You know, it's the time to find out how we can help you. 

00:15:30
DANIELLE There is a part of you're the one's actually to speak. 

00:15:30
KATE We want to try and help you get your life back. What are you afraid (inaudible )? 

00:15:40
[sil.] 

00:15:45
NARRATOR For the next five days. Tamsin doesn't speak and I can see the therapist so wondering what to do next. 

00:15:55
DANIELLE It's almost around the clock staff now. One stop, two times we were up on a three o'clock and we're up, up six in the morning as she was so having fits as well. You dry your hair and everything. You know, you, you actually can't let her out of your sight, you know, this is sort of umm… uh… two nights where I've, I actually slept in the lounge. 

00:16:20
[sil.] 

00:16:25
DANIELLE Is it good? You, you , if you feel like okay with us. Really need to talk. We would like to communicate, we would like to speak. When you want to you can speak… you took… let say is it to say what are we gonna do now? 

00:16:50
UNKNOWN I want you to ask us (inaudible ) 

00:16:51
DANIELLE What are we gonna do now? 

00:16:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:16:56
DANIELLE Umm… uh… 

00:16:56
TAMSIN Jungle Book. 

00:16:56
DANIELLE Jungle Book? 

00:17:00
TAMSIN Ah… 

00:17:00
DANIELLE Wow. 

00:17:00
TAMSIN Vouchers. 

00:17:05
DANIELLE Vouchers, what are we gonna do now then? 

00:17:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

00:17:10
DANIELLE Well, okay (inaudible ) 

00:17:11
TAMSIN Something gonna do. I don't know, what do you want to do? I don't know, what do you want to know, don't start that again, what you wanna do? 

00:17:20
DANIELLE Umm… have you been with the vouchers in the jungle. 

00:17:25
TAMSIN Yeah, he looks sad. 

00:17:30
[sil.] 

00:17:35
DANIELLE When you been for the last six days, know you are up what we gonna do? 

00:17:40
TAMSIN I don't know, what do you want to do? 

00:17:45
[music] 

00:17:50
NARRATOR It was a relief to have her back. Having spend six weeks with Tamsin I realize how little I know about her childhood. 

00:18:00
TASMIN We all have been spectators mommy since (inaudible ) I cringe when I look at the shoes actually here. I got believed very, very badly at school and both my brothers went to the same school as well and they were I mean they held all the school records you could name particularly in sport and stuff like that and it was, you know, it's (inaudible ) your brothers all, you? They're well good, look at you and I oh, that's the way it's one that gets believed. I guess I was one in the year. That's all. This is I was eleven years old on a trip to (inaudible ) I would go up's island. 

00:18:40
UNKNOWN What did you had for (inaudible ) 

00:18:45
TAMSIN I do already planned out my marriage and the children I was going to have and house I was going to live in, I was going to have a stash mansion which had room for my friends to come and live. Ah-huh, I don't have friends. I had lots of little friends of being (inaudible ), no best friend I've never had a best friend. 

00:19:01
UNKNOWN So did you have boyfriends when you were younger? 

00:19:05
TAMSIN No, I've never had a boyfriend have never been kissed, too ugly. 

00:19:15
NARRATOR The more time I spend with Tamsin the more I get to like her. It's a shame she thinks so little of herself. The therapists at the center believe the family work will help Tamsin but I'm not sure why she's so opposed to it. 

00:19:30
TAMSIN It rips everything open and apart. It destroys families. 

00:19:40
LOUIS I think, I think that is for you think would happen is if you force and feelings were to come out. I think you worried that it would destroy, you know, your relationship with your family. 

00:19:50
TAMSIN I don't care if it just destroys me but in… the (inaudible ) must not hurts anyone else. I love my family. 

00:20:00
LOUIS Yes, I know that. 

00:20:00
TAMSIN I don't want this at all and if I could turn around and say no and get stuff to it then I really would be. 

00:20:10
LOUIS You mean very involved with your family. They are very much you've a part of you and your life. 

00:20:15
TAMSIN It would destroy the family and it also hurt, hurt them very much with things, it is say, if family therapy end up being force for me the first in a days I kill myself. 

00:20:30
NARRATOR Tamsin's family come to collect her every other weekend. 

00:20:35
TAMSIN They usually my mommy message, "Leave, leaving in half an hour. be ready." They'll be here, just is the house (inaudible ) themselves. Shame. 

00:20:50
NARRATOR I got the feeling Tamsin has had enough talking and is reluctant to attend therapy and deal with the reasons for her distress. 

00:21:00
TAMSIN I've always tried to attend this one I am not trying, that's it. 

00:21:05
DANIELLE What? You just don't want to? 

00:21:10
TAMSIN Today, no, I'm actually very glad, I'm missing it. Doesn't clear the air ends up killing me at the moment… 

00:21:15
DANIELLE May be won't, may it doesn't. 

00:21:15
TAMSIN You can't say a word in this house to majority of people without being all drugged up over and over and over again even if it's just a fun word, you are really pushing again bullshit to you all saying, you don't push. And I can't do a house meet right now I can't. I really can't, I need to take the rest of them. So I could run when they come. 

00:21:50
UNKNOWN Hello. 

00:21:55
KATE All right Tamsin. Look at weekend. 

00:22:00
TAMSIN They kept going on alone about house meeting, there wouldn't drop it and they can say I haven't told even though they have to wait till afterwards that everything. I don't answer if you were in house meeting you just that ringing the doorbell. 

00:22:10
UNKNOWN Never (inaudible )

UNKNOWN Well, I think you definitely (inaudible ) some kind of… 

00:22:16
UNKNOWN Well, if you know some of the good times things are wrong that we know better you say you would come at this time. This is the first times so anyone can see. 

00:22:20
UNKNOWN Yes, of course. You come down (inaudible ). 

00:22:26
UNKNOWN Ten (inaudible ) two, two, three, al right. Well, unfortunately, we'll go out tonight is there any chance I've got to come pick her up so. Thank you. 

00:22:30
KATE Okay. 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN Okay, thank you bye. Come on. 

00:22:40
NARRATOR For the first time I begin to feel that things might not work out. 

00:22:45
[sil.] 

00:22:50
NARRATOR When I next see Tamsin, she's at her family home but is due to go back to the Crisis Centre. 

00:22:55
UNKNOWN She doesn't like going back to where she is and I think that seems to obsess her. Am I right? Or not? 

00:23:00
TAMSIN I don't like, being so far away. 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN But when she's home here… 

00:23:10
TAMSIN But you think me better mommy, I don't mind being there but I know they can't.

00:23:30
TAMSIN But you just been turned around saying, I'm normal when I am here, no, I'm not that's not family. 

00:23:35
UNKNOWN NO, no… apart from the fetch you'd likely, then any moment to go, you just had one just now. 

00:23:35
TAMSIN You can't say, showing I'm upset or panicking and charge you gets cross. You do. 

00:23:40
UNKNOWN I don't think I've ever been cross that you had a fit. I get worried why would I be cross? 

00:23:45
TAMSIN You get cross and I get panicky, you get upset. 

00:23:50

00:24:10
[music] 

00:24:15
NARRATOR Over the last three months. Tamsin has been struggling with her sleepwalking. I decided to give her a camera and I'm touched by her courage to share her torment. 

00:24:25
TAMSIN We're pretty much just woke up on the floor, fit on the floor. We've don't have an even fit sleep walking to, they advice how doing that again, how far I've gonna go. And I'm (inaudible ) I don't know want to sleepwalk anymore and I don't want to… that I just feel, I just, I just had enough. I hate like this. 

00:25:00
[sil.] 

00:25:05
NARRATOR In the morning house meeting the therapist try once again to discuss the cause of Tamsin's sleepwalking. 

00:25:15
TAMSIN I want to know we all are having a chap lock(ph), yes or no? 

00:25:20
DANIELLE Tamsin, it, it happened almost every night and several times in night and we never got to talk about it. 

00:25:25
KATE We are not just gonna leave the door open for you to get out Tamsin. But to lookout what this sleepwalking is all about for you. 

00:25:35
TAMSIN I have no idea, I don't even know I'm since I wake up. I never I do I wake up I normally not in my right senses in me, you know , I'm completely in actually freaked out, you wake up with that freaking bas (ph) right in your face. Get a bloody chap lock (ph) with my front door and we talk it's much she pays then I'll sit here and pay the (inaudible ) go. 

00:25:56
NARRATOR If Tamsin can't make sense of things here. The therapists are concerned. Their only option would be to return her to a locked psychiatric ward. 

00:26:05
TAMSIN Yes, I disturbed you, you don't even think of it. 

00:26:10
DANIELLE We do, I do, I think about it because I sleep with my door open every single night. 

00:26:15
TAMSIN Oh, you don't sleep that night, and you think, you do, you don't. 

00:26:20
DANIELLE We need to talk. 

00:26:25
TAMSIN What is told Danielle for. You are a therapist how long you have been talking about cage and the colour of the walls. You can't let (inaudible ) and change the colour of the room wall, and how the hell, are you gonna help me or anyone else like me. 

00:26:45

TAMSIN She missing is that, she I don't know I want to be normal again because… no matter if I recover tomorrow… never take another fit again already feels. I'm mental health now. I can be written enough the books, so I could have anything like that I'm… this thing will never change is… people get scared of mental health. They have realized that people in mental health are no more. Strange isn't? The matter actually the same. We just afraid. That's all. 

00:27:55

00:28:00
LOUIS The next couple of weeks they'll actually crucial part of that is that here… that we've now got it take for the family work. It have, there is an agreed date, umm… at the 31st of January. I think it's going to get even more difficult at this point. It's whether we can hold her long enough for that to happen and see whether we survive it. Umm… if we do it will be a very positive and very healthy, first step in her recovery. 

00:28:35
NARRATOR When Tamsin hears there is a date for a family work. She refuses to attend her therapy with Louis. 

00:28:40
DANIELLE Tamsin. 

00:28:45
TAMSIN I can't do it. 

00:28:45
DANIELLE You have an ultimatum, and that's, that's we can't get out of this staff. You have an ultimatum, that's it. 

00:28:50
TAMSIN Yeah, we've reached ultimatum… 

00:28:50
DANIELLE We were laying down the lower. 

00:28:55
TAMSIN We've reached to the ultimatum. I have never done before. 

00:28:55
DANIELLE It's, it's your terms… 

00:29:00
TAMSIN It's not my term, it's never has been my terms. Oh, why don't I found first I've rid of fine therapy, I've very rid of fine therapy, we think its best we talk about it, we talk about, you talk about (inaudible ), you talk about, you feel like, the girl hadn't do you like but now, I'll talk about (inaudible ), talk about what I feel like I can go ahead and do what I like.

00:29:20
TAMSIN Do not try my way. 

00:29:20
DANIELLE You seem to have one way of doing things and so as … 

00:29:20
TAMSIN I have tried one hundred and different ways all your ways, all your ways so far. Now this is my way. I'm not coming. That's my way. 

00:29:35
DANIELLE Our fingers going to be down on her terms or not. And I don't think we gonna give him give him that obviously not. 

00:29:40
UNKNOWN Tamsin kept saying they, they want family therapy. She I think was quite against for what reason I don't know that sometime to know and also that's fine. But I fail to see how families therapy is going to help with somebody who actually… hasn't lived at home since she was eighteen and it certainly can't be on a regular basis because we can't keep traipsing all the way over there but will give it a world out try anything once, once. 

00:30:10
NARRATOR Although Tamsin has to attend family work. The front door will have chap lock (ph)and for the first time in 30 years the Crisis Centre will lock out one of their guest. 

00:30:25
DANIELLE The next step will be to, to talk about, uh… things but you know the way we are going it's, uh… it's a slow road. 

00:30:35
TAMSIN We discussed the front door and, put a chap lock (ph)on it. I can hear some (inaudible ) so hopeless what Danielle is doing. He is such a sweety and I gave him such a hard time. (inaudible ) person and really is arrogant but he is a very good heart. He's so good. He's just so nice to me, sometimes. 

00:31:05
DANIELLE I think should be very pleased. 

00:31:10
NARRATOR But I wonder how Tamsin will respond to the next piece of news. 

00:31:15
[sil.] 

00:31:20
DANIELLE Okay, actually there is something I wanna tell you. 

00:31:20

00:32:00

00:32:05
NARRATOR I haven't seen Tamsin for four days after the new guest has arrived. And Tamsin is barricading herself in her room. 

00:32:15
TAMSIN This suitcase we should pack through our bags your stuff. I'm gonna (inaudible ). 

00:32:25
[sil.] 

00:32:30
TAMSIN That's how I've been living for the last four days. I'm not going out of my room for anything. I've got some wipes fortunately in here, umm… facial wipes for me since, keep clean with. I've used the toilet… so as so embarrassing. But I used the toilet pretty much once a day. All most entirely show wise started, My original excuse was because this new person who've got come. 

00:33:05
[sil.] 

00:33:10
TAMSIN But it was an excuse. I've really don't know what comes up in my mind. I'm scared. 

00:33:25
NARRATOR It's difficult to know what Tamsin is scared of. But the family work is now eminent. I suspect this is plain on her mind. She stopped eating and never concerns about her isolation. 

00:33:35
TAMSIN Nothing, nothing right since. And no where you listen. 

00:33:40
KATE Well, I think we do listen certainly, you know, Danielle and I but it's really difficult to know what to do about it. 

00:33:50
TAMSIN I really don't want to be (inaudible ) I'm alive. I shouldn't be, I shouldn't be, I'd have dead. 

00:33:55

00:34:45
[sil.] 

00:34:55
NARRATOR The next time I see Tamsin's parents. I'm not sure what is more worrying for them. Tamsin's fits or the idea that their daughter has an emotional difficulties. 

00:35:05
UNKNOWN So, psychology was had things that doesn't stop her leading a normal life. Fitting does. They are patent to be not psychological and they have never ever been investigated fully. Never, even once, anybody ask about what she was like before and everybody wherever she goes normally sort of issue. She always been like this. And when you live in an environment wherever you put saying to you, you know, what makes you feel like you do, I think back I mean, of course you gonna find something. She is completely institution about ours or you not? Or you not? There are some wonderful behavior patterns but she aim's to please sure do what pleases them or what she thinks they expect. Oh, when she's at home I'm afraid if she's treated just as normally because, because she is normal there is no reason why she has to have any special treatment or special attention or even any less. Rightly or wrongly, but as nobody else seems to know we much who are trying to provoke. Everybody wants it? 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN Yes please. 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:36:10

00:36:35
UNKNOWN I'm just giving up the wisdom not about Brussels sprouts when it's not Christmas. 

00:36:40
NARRATOR Later tonight Tamsin's family would arrive at the Crisis Centre for the family work. 

00:36:45
LOUIS There is a lot of tension around this. I don't think anybody is looking forward to it. But it is an essential part of the work and I don't know we were at, uh… yeah Tamsin must be feeling absolutely terrified about it. 

00:37:00
TAMSIN I'm joining tonight to start my family work. I don't want my family hurt, I don't want them involved in this. And they know all this since in spite of what they say, they don't really want to be involved either. They just want the magic pyramids and (inaudible ) back around them. 

00:37:25
[music] 

00:37:30
DANIELLE You know, it's all nice time for the Tamsin's family work. So there is a lot of anxiety I think. 

00:37:40
TAMSIN They have, umm… left. So I hope, I think, they'd make it more right sometime this now. Sorry. 

00:37:45
KATE So anything we can do to help with your nerves. 

00:37:50

00:38:05
UNKNOWN Hi 

00:38:05
JOSEPH BERKE Hello. 

00:38:05
UNKNOWN Hello. 

00:38:10
NARRATOR The family session will be run by Doctor Joseph Berke. His first interest is to get the family's perspective on what they think has happened to Tamsin. 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN February, the 7th, will be three years since she left the house, uh… perfectly normal that's the word one can use and is now like this. 

00:38:30
UNKNOWN That seem the medical profession got a bit bored because they couldn't find the reason so they bumped her off to the psychological section in the mental health and looking at the state of my sister now quite frankly I don't think you've done absolutely nothing but what done with personality. 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN What I feel that most of the behavior we are getting now there is some learnt, acquired from living in the environment she's been living in. 

00:38:50
JOSEPH BERKE You call Tamsin, Tamsin in once. But I think for most part, you, you are afraid to Tamsin does. She or her, and she was a an outsider from your home… 

00:39:05
UNKNOWN I wouldn't keep saying, Tamsin this, and Tamsin that because she is with us and you know who we are talking to. 

00:39:10
JOSEPH BERKE You feel ashamed of that what's happen? 

00:39:10
UNKNOWN Ashamed? Good heavens know… This is my daughter. Tamsin is my daughter, sorry… and we love her and no, we're not ashamed. 

00:39:20
TAMSIN You can't just have that, you haven't said what you think of this pace is a ace and fact you are ashamed with the facts of mental health. You don't tell anyone it's mental health doing like that. 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN A vision good person who ever asked about you knows exactly where you are and it's mental health… nobody ashamed of you dear. 

00:39:35
JOSEPH BERKE Since you were angry between yourselves two more between you and Tamsin. 

00:39:40

00:39:45
JOSEPH BERKE Observing. 

00:39:45

00:39:50
JOSEPH BERKE In this situation. Right. 

00:39:50
UNKNOWN Tamsin in this silly her face expression she gets on her face and people are saying, saying… I'm sorry but that is just not how she used to behave. I mean Tamsin and I've always argue but the point is just Tamsin's nobody wondering more shouting then I'm. But although I have a back being a pain in the back side then like this. 

00:40:10
UNKNOWN Each of them have taken their own path in life and all done very well at it, including Tamsin. She's marvelous at art, she's wonderful on the computer and all the children are leaders they are not followers. 

00:40:25
TAMSIN You know, no, it's haven't change things.

00:41:15

00:41:25
UNKNOWN No, but (inaudible ) earth, would ever anybody ever this wave me now the fitting is psychological. 

00:41:35
JOSEPH BERKE Uh… I wanna know with your permission this been one and I'm receiving three meetings. 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN Honestly, honestly. I have been up I thought I'd leave my daughter has since six o'clock this morning. I'm not doing this too often. I do have to be perfectly honest with you. I'm still not convinced. I, I don't know my own mind with help this is going to be.

00:42:05
UNKNOWN Yeah she think is any point to add that. 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN …Down? No because they are still trying to tie your behavior, your fetch to, to the family and your life which I don't frankly myself. This thing has got anything to do with it. But I don't know. Good bye. Behave yourself, all right. 

00:42:20

00:42:25
UNKNOWN And you, and you… 

00:42:30

00:42:35
NARRATOR The following day Tamsin takes an over dose. 

00:42:40
TAMSIN The family works has gone wrong. Mummy is ashamed of me being, you know, very much ashamed of me being, you know. There is so stop and than they were as far they were have to make this journey which, they don't has traveled all this time. 

00:43:00
[sil.] 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN You are okay? 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:43:10
NARRATOR Luckily, Tamsin had only taken a small number of pills and returns from hospital later that night. 

00:43:15
[music] 

00:43:20
NARRATOR I think it will be a long road to Tamsin's recovery but if things don't work out here. I hate the thought of going back to a psychiatric ward and being locked up. 

00:43:35
[music] 

00:43:40
LOUIS If we don't get through this then Tamsin will remain stuck for a very, very long time to come, you know, so she's an extremely talented young woman. She has such a love of her life sometimes. She's seem sparking her life and, you know, self (inaudible ) but is one misses the only other people can see it. We do want to so often someone's introduce her to that part of herself. 

00:44:10
KATE Oh, good flowers. Wow! It's so you Tamsin? Thank you. 

00:44:20
TAMSIN You've got it. 

00:44:25
DANIELLE This is… Thanks so very much. I thought this is first we have ever had a present. 

00:44:30
TAMSIN It's so very easy to say thank you in this house. Just (inaudible ) bring a smile. Let show them we do appreciate with that interest very, very much. 

00:44:40
NARRATOR Three months after the first session Tamsin's family have been unable to return to the Crisis Center for further family work. 

00:44:50
TAMSIN You really be happy I would never (inaudible )? 

00:44:53
UNKNOWN Oh, yes. 

00:44:55
NARRATOR Although Tamsin seems more settled. I do wonder if she would like to get better until she is able to come to terms with her emotional difficulties and she realizes, there is no shame in that. 

00:45:10
