Thought for Food Jan Gray with Elaine Davies 

00:00:00
counselling DVDs in association with University of Wales, Newport Prifysgol Cymru, Casinewydd 

00:00:30
MIKE SIMMONS Hello, my name is Mike Simmons. Jan Gray, a colleague of mine, is a BACP accredited counselor. And a BABCP accredited cognitive therapist. Jan has a specific interest in issues around weight management. And in 2002, she was invited to join a multi-discipline re-specialist weight management clinic, working with morbidly obese people in Wales. This clinic was amongst the first of its kind in the country, and has successfully treated hundreds of people over the years. Jan is joining me in the studio today to talk about a series of counseling sessions, which we filmed several years ago, and in which another colleague, Elaine Davies, took on the role of a client working on the issues around weight management. I say role, because this work was undertaken specifically to be filmed. But it was real work, not a role-play. As you'll see in the sessions themselves, there were areas that Elaine was happy to explore, and other areas that she wished to leave alone. And Jan respected that boundary. The focus of the work was Elaine's desire to take control of her weight, and I'm going to be asking Jan to tell us about how she was working with Elaine, how she saw the work progressing, and how she thinks it might have proceeded, had it been more than the three sessions. So Jan, these sessions were focused on the concept of weight management, but I'm conscious that that wasn't really talked about very much. The key issue you seem to be exploring with Elaine was her relationship with food, can you talk a bit about that? 

00:02:15
JAN GRAY Yeah, and, uh, I think it was really useful, um, first of all to find out, um, what somebody's-, what Elaine's relationship was with food, because I think if we just focused on weight management and started looking at calorie counting, and losing weight, it may well be that, um, we make matters worse. And I think for some people, their relationship with food is m-, say more about how they feel about themselves, uh, about how they cope with difficulties, how they self-soothe. And of course if you start to take away their coping mechanism, um, before you put anything else in place, and before you understand why that coping mechanism's there, you can create a problem. 

00:03:05
MIKE SIMMONS So, I'm using food as a way of dealing with what's going on in the rest of my life, you pull that away, and then I'm left floundering. 

00:03:15
JAN GRAY Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. 

00:03:15
MIKE SIMMONS So it's pulling out the foundation, rather than dismantling the building. 

00:03:20
JAN GRAY Yeah, absolutely. 

00:03:20
MIKE SIMMONS So what we learn from this work was that food equals love for Elaine. That was very clear, and it came up in a number of different ways. Uh, is that a common business? 

00:03:30
JAN GRAY Yeah, very, very much so. Um, food, if you think about it, sometimes, and as a mother myself, I mean I recognize that I do it, as one of the ways will show that I-, I love somebody is I'll feed them. And that-, this is very common, and we think about, it's the first thing, uh, a mother does with its child, it is feeds it. And so, uh, in the case of, uh, Elaine, it was that food was in, in periods of her life, the only time she could recognize any love being shown her. 

00:04:05
MIKE SIMMONS So she's gonna keep on doing that, because that-, that's the mechanism that's been established. 

00:04:15
JAN GRAY And that was one of the things we wanted to find out, if that was happening. If that was, you know, if, if her self-soothing mechanism involved food. 

00:04:20
MIKE SIMMONS And the message that has been kind of added to that was something about putting the children first, it's almost like the children maybe have to have the love, which is represented by food, uh and she is then continuing to do that even though the children are young adults. 

00:04:40
JAN GRAY Yeah. Yeah. I think in Elaine's um, case, there was a very strong, um, rule or message given that good mothers feed their children. 

00:04:55
MIKE SIMMONS And she was also getting the message that almost by default, she wasn't a good mother. So it was an impossible task, that she was stuck with, so you can see how food is already occupying a place that doesn't quite work. So we got lots of pictures, uh, where we heard about the grandmother's table. Uh, which is plunk in the middle of the kitchen. And you also enter the grandmother's house through the kitchen, so it's kind of straight into the table, you sit at the table, uh, and also there's this huge cupboard of food, and there was a very, uh, telling part of I think the third session, where we see Elaine lost in-, in looking in the cupboard of food. It was absolutely there. 

00:05:45
JAN GRAY Yes, I had uh, a sense that Elaine-, because she had very different experiences around food in her growing up years, because right at the start she talked about she was too anxious to eat as young child. So, um, there was a link for her between not feeling happy, and not eating. And that, and then she went to live with her grandparents where food was, uh, a very special time, her family meals, it was, you know her grandmother was a good cook, and she enjoyed the meal time, so that's I think where her message of food meant love, um, was sort of really embedded, and then coming back to her mother, when she recognized that the only way her mom seemed to show her was through food. I mean when Elaine was thinking about the, the cupboard stocked full of food with her mom-, in her mom's kitchen, it was almost like she's got that but, but where's the, where's the love. The food that I need- 

00:06:45
MIKE SIMMONS Right. Right. 

00:06:50
JAN GRAY The emotional food. 

00:06:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, yeah, yeah, so the only language of affection, of love, is through this third party, food. So it becomes very, very important, and it's not about sustenance. It's about something quite different. 

00:07:05
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah, and it's sort of explains why the last thing you would want to do at this stage of working with someone is take away that food. 

00:07:15
MIKE SIMMONS Right, so what you're doing all the time is exploring what it means to her, what's really going on. So you're, you're clearly not counting calories, you're also not talking about weight loss. 

00:07:25
JAN GRAY No, well, Elaine said right at the start, and uh, that she didn't necessarily want to lose weight, she wanted to develop a healthy relationship with food. And the-, the way I would think is that if you can develop a healthy relationship with food, and in the case of Elaine, it-, I think it was a more compassionate view towards herself, which would be tied up in with that. Then, by default she would eat more healthily, and you would assume that the weight would then start to come off, so-, so it would be the same end, but a very different route that you take. Um- 

00:08:10
MIKE SIMMONS Can I just check out-, I'm understanding this, there's something about we all need affection, we all need love, uh, and if I am only used to receiving it through the means of food, then it, yeah- 

00:08:30
JAN GRAY I mean, it, it makes, you know, it makes it very understandable that food would be. Uh, both explicit and implicit, because explicit you know how do we-, you know, how do we treat ourselves very often it's through food. But there is also that implicit message that, that it's the only way I can be good to myself. And my thinking is that if you learn to value yourself, and it is about value, you know, uh, um, if you learn to value yourself and love yourself, then you would love what you do to your body, and what you, how you treat your body, and part of that would be how you would feed your body. 

00:09:10
MIKE SIMMONS And I'm thinking about the part of the work when you were talking about exercise. And we'll come to this in a bit, I expect, but there was something about uh, encouraging her to look at when she could do exercise, but in some way that exercise was about time for herself, about doing something for herself. And, that didn't seem to come that easily. 

00:09:30
JAN GRAY No, and I don't think that's uncommon, um, and certainly not with somebody who had the rule that other people's needs are more important than mine. 

00:09:40
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, and that was a very clear rule, as we saw was that. 

00:09:45
JAN GRAY So exercise, I mean we found that actually time, I, I think there's a misconception that when we're talking about exercise and time for ourself, it has to be big chunks of time. Um, I think if you have five minutes that you say this is time for me, it's good enough. And, I think that's what Elaine started to discover that, perhaps there were those little slots of time. 

00:10:15
MIKE SIMMONS And, I mean I think there is that dynamic between meeting my needs, and being selfish. And almost by definition, if I meet my need-, if I, if I've had that parental message, always meeting my needs is about being selfish. And so there's a judgment-, and so it's very hard then. 

00:10:35
JAN GRAY But you could argue that in order to meet other people's needs adequately and appropriately, you need to look after yourself. 

00:10:40
MIKE SIMMONS Absolutely. Absolutely, yeah. Yeah. Can I ask you a bit about the way that you worked with Elaine. The actual structure, because I was conscious that at the start and end of each session, you asked for mood check, how she was, what was that about? 

00:11:00
JAN GRAY Um, well first of all, it gave us some access to some of her thoughts that she was having about coming to the session, so we might be able to work with those thoughts in the session. Um, obviously some of those thoughts would be quite live, in, uh, and so to start with, it's given me a gauge of what she's fearing might happen in the session, what she's anticipating, what she's hoping for. Um, and uh, so we can work with those thoughts to see how realistic they are how helpful they are, and what they're relating to. At the end of the session, again that mood check to see the impact of, you know what we've done, has been on her, and again to capture some of her thoughts, her immediate sort of pop thoughts as it were from the session itself. Um, it can give an indication of what was helpful, what wasn't helpful, and perhaps, you know, it can help us uncover some of her beliefs, some of her deeper held cognitions about, um, uh, about the problem, about talking about her problem. 

00:12:00
MIKE SIMMONS Because all the time you're working with both conscious concepts and unconscious concepts, both of which are being very, very powerful. 

00:12:10
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah, and hoping, using that mood check as a way of sort of trying to tie the two together by getting her to be able to focus in on the mood. Uh, and perhaps be able to explore, well, what's generated that mood. What-, you know, what have we talked about um, because it might be that she should have been left with a mood, which you have to think is an unconscious process, and by being able to talk about, you know, what's happened then we can bring it into the awareness a little bit more. And give us a clue, you know, better understanding of what's going on for Elaine. 

00:12:45
MIKE SIMMONS You worked quite hard to establish goals throughout all the sessions. They-, they kept on coming up and you, uh, trying to identify what we're working towards, what are you going to be doing and so forth. Sometimes that was quite hard to tie Elaine down, what do you think was going on there? 

00:13:05
JAN GRAY Well, I think certainly my experience of working with people trying to manage their weight, is that they'll very often set themselves unrealistically high goals. Or unrealistic goals. Um, and what can happen as a result of that is that they-, they don't achieve those goals, um, and what can happen as a result of that is that you-, you lose motivation. And so I think it's really important to have some goals, but to try and make them small goals, and achievable goals, in the sense that I can do this, and I'm-, it doesn't have to be a major change in order for there to be some change. 

00:13:45
MIKE SIMMONS The whole issue about every journey starts with one step. 

00:13:50
JAN GRAY Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely, and I think for me the idea of motivation, you know, motivation is real-, it's really important to have a goal to-, when you're motivated, but it's got to believe that you can achieve that goal. And if the two aren't in place, then no matter how commendable the goal is, then you know, it's-, it's not going to be achieved. Because if you don't believe that you can do it, you're not going to, you know, you're possibly not going to try. 

00:14:15
MIKE SIMMONS So it's that issue of uh, you might have a big goal, uh, but you break it down to small achievable goals rather than just going for the big one. 

00:14:25
JAN GRAY And of course what that does is in-, very often, if you have a-, an underlying low self-esteem, and a sense that you are a, no good, a failure, I can't do it, whatever, the underlying belief is it's working to sort of chip away at that. Because, you know, that'll be, that underlying unhelpful belief, or being played out. You know, I can't do this, I am a failure, um, and so it will be chipping away at that by, well I, I am a failure, but I did do that. 

00:15:00
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yes, and then I did this, and I did that- 

00:15:05
JAN GRAY And then you start to think, question, well, can I be such a failure after all? 

00:15:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yes. You, I was conscious that you were also getting Elaine to write things down from time to time. My guess is that's part of the same process, making things concrete. 

00:15:20
JAN GRAY Absolutely, yeah, it can be very easy to forget what we thought of 10 minutes ago. Uh, and certain when it comes to weight management, uh, it can be extremely helpful to monitor food, what you're eating, and trying to do it as you go along, you know, not at the end of the day try and record what you've eaten. Because it, um, we can forget so many things that we eat. And then, then it becomes a mystery to us as to why, uh, things aren't working out well. You know, we forget what we've eaten whilst we're walking, or the thing we've eaten while we're driving in the car, or watching TV. So that's why, when it comes to food, it's important, but I think it's the same when it comes to feelings, thoughts, that we can forget that that was the situation, and the thought that I had that made me feel that way. Um, and of course if you can record some of those thoughts, you can later look at them and question them and see are they accurate, are they helpful, are they are they real? Or are they just something that you're telling yourself in the moment. 

00:16:30
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, I was conscious when I was watching this session that Elaine says at some point, that she hasn't stepped on the scale for years. And, and how I heard that was hmm, that's gonna be difficult, because you're not going to be able to measure change. And wondering whether I'm right in thinking that, or whether there's also an argument, well, actually that sort of bit of a red herring, because behavioral change about you feeling better about yourself that can be verified, is maybe more important than worrying about is just worrying about the end product rather than how you get there. 

00:17:15
JAN GRAY And, and I, agree and disagree with you on that one. 

00:17:15
MIKE SIMMONS I just can't lose. 

00:17:15
JAN GRAY Yeah, because I think I think it is important that you are realistic with yourself about what you weigh. I mean, the idea would be that Elaine could get on the scales and see what she weighs, and is happy or realizes that, perhaps she needs to do something to address it. I think, you know, by not getting on the scales, you're, you're not A, you're not being realistic, you know, you're not acknowledging that this is what I weight. Um, B, you're not monitoring change, as you say, um, but you, C, you're also potentially in your mind, weighing more than the reality of it, is. So that-, that would be why I'm encouraging people to monitor their weight. I think ideally, um, the downside, and I think with-, in the case of Elaine, was she had years and years and years of doing that, and being very discontent with what she was seeing on the scales. And, as we said right at the start, her goal wasn't to weigh less, it was to develop a healthy relationship with food. And so, yes, I think at some stage, I think it would be helpful for Elaine to, to monitor her weight, and for many other people trying to manage their weight, I think it is helpful. But it wasn't the be all and end all. And, if you see in the video one of the things we did talk about was how helpful it would be for her to have somebody else just monitoring her weight. So, because I think a lot of people get fixated on the, on the figure, and they have an idea in their mind of, you know, when I reach that weight, I'm going to be a happy person. Or when I reach that weight, my weight, you know, I'm, things will change. Um, and that needs really counterproductive. 

00:19:05
MIKE SIMMONS Because the weight might change, because things have changed, rather than things change because the weight's changed. 

00:19:15
JAN GRAY But it may well be, um, with other people, uh, that you, there would be another way of monitoring change. I-, I think what we needed to have is some, as you say, monitor of change, and progress, because how would you know when she's doing well otherwise? 

00:19:30
MIKE SIMMONS We got a sense of a moment uh, of change, when she talked about going to the Chinese chip shop, and choosing to have boiled rice, rather than chips. And so you could imagine, uh, a record of food that she's eaten, you'd look at it, that's what I used to eat, this is what I'm eating now, this is a week's food. And see change there. Quite regardless of scales. 

00:20:00
JAN GRAY Yeah, absolutely, and that's-, you know, that suggests that writing things down, you know, is a helpful, is a helpful tool. Um, it was interesting that that visit was, uh, was sort of really relating to her mood. How she was- 

00:20:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, how she saw herself. Then allow her to treat herself from there. So that felt like it was very significant, that it wasn't just making what she saw as a healthier choice, but it was tied in with what had happened to her previously. 

00:20:30
JAN GRAY Yeah, I mean, they, it, it was really interesting that she had a good day being with people which of course as we talked about earlier, was something that normally meals are, are um, Elaine has meals on her own, and she's acknowledged that she's spends a lot of time on her own. But she'd had a good day, she'd had a lot of positives, she'd been with people who'd given her a lot of positive feedback. So, I, I'm guessing that at that point Elaine was feeling pretty positive about herself. 

00:21:05
MIKE SIMMONS There, there's something in my mind about sort of disruption, that the sort of belief system we have, whether it's a negative or a positive one, but when things happen from outside that challenge that belief, then it can disrupt a whole series of, uh, mechanisms and thoughts that follow on from- 

00:21:25
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah and I think that's a really good point, Mike, because I think for a lot of people inappropriate unhealthy eating is almost habitual, and in the same ways that some of our unhelpful beliefs about ourselves become habitual. Uh, we never question some of the unhelpful beliefs that we have about ourselves, because they've been there for so long. And so, if we can somehow break that, that cycle, break that habit of behavior, but also the habit of the way we think about ourselves, uh, and that can be hard to do. It can feel very strange, it can feel very clunky to start thinking that I might be worth taking care of um, because the habitual behavior is being that actually I am not worth taking care of. The, the habitual thought has been that I'm not worth taking care of. 

00:22:20
MIKE SIMMONS I've always been interested in, in the idea of the random event, and the impact it can have on us. The-, the person we meet completely by chance, that has a different view of life. The person we sit next to on the bus and have a conversation with, can actually have a, a completely profound effect on the rest of our lives. Because something comes into our consciousness, but we weren't aware of before. 

00:22:45
JAN GRAY Yeah, and I think it, in some ways, that's the purpose of being able to talk about, uh, in the case of Elaine, her issues with food is, in the hope that a thought will appear, and idea will appear, that she hadn't, had in her life before. 

00:23:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yeah. There was something very interesting for me around Liam, and food for him, and the idea of eating his food. I mean it was an-, it, it clearly intrigued her, the very idea of it, uh, and I think you saw both the kind of unconscious messages going on, you can't possibly do that, you put children first you know, you're not a good mother, otherwise, and then the more conscious thoughts about that, and then gosh, what an intriguing exercise. Very powerful. 

00:23:40
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah. Um, I mean the most, most sort of interesting part of it was that Liam was probably totally unaware of all of that. Um, and, and as opposed for Elaine, because food was so tied in with being able to offer and receive love, um, it may be that her sort of not, um, telling Liam something, but by getting his food, was, you know the easiest way for her to show, uh, she loves him, but of course for Liam, he doesn't have that, that programming necessarily. He doesn't necessarily know that that's what- 

00:24:25
MIKE SIMMONS What's going on, I, had, I seem to remember there was a moment when Elaine was-, said something like he may not know that, that he may be oblivious to this whole business, and if I eat the banana, well there might be a moment of, uh, oh, mom, but beyond that it's of no significance at all. 

00:24:45
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah, and in fact I think one of the food items, she said he didn't even like that much. It wasn't that fussed about. So. 

00:24:55
MIKE SIMMONS I thought in second session, uh, there seemed to be moments of huge insight. It was, it went, it didn't go slowly, but there were moments when she was just completely lost in thought, and making connections. And it felt to me that it felt to you really important to just go, uh, at her pace, that was the most important thing that could be helping her. 

00:25:20
JAN GRAY Well I, I think when somebody's being faced with some anomalies in their thinking, uh, and having to question something that has felt right albeit it's been unhealthy and unhelpful, um, that's a-, that's a real struggle, and that's something that they-, that I think it would be inappropriate to, to jump into soon, because really what Elaine was having to learn was, uh, a different way of thinking about food, a different way of thinking about herself. And it was, it was almost having to challenge a belief that has felt to be part of her for so long. 

00:26:05
MIKE SIMMONS Right, which is incredibly difficult work. Yes, I, I've, I because we need the world to be something we can rely on, however pleasant or unpleasant it is, and suddenly, the ground's falling under her feet, because she's, she's thinking, well hang on maybe this isn't so real. 

00:26:20
JAN GRAY Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and I think what can happen is, when we have a an unhelpful pattern of behavior, and in the case of Elaine, historically it had been dieting. Starving herself. Going without. For all the right reasons, she was doing that. Um, but that-, that wasn't un-, an unhealthy pattern of behavior, which was there as a, as a coping mechanism, and when things get tough or uh, you hit a, hit a low point in your life, instead of thinking actually, this coping mechanism doesn't work, we just think we're not doing it enough. We're not doing it hard enough. Or well enough, so we try more. And I suppose what happened in session two is Elaine was given the challenge, well do you have to try that way? Could there be a different way? 

00:27:15
MIKE SIMMONS I mean, I might be bein' a bit fanciful here, but uh, I was struck with there bein' a bit of a parallel in that session. Rather than just throwing the food down, she was savoring it. And rather than just ideas zipping by, she was stopping and really looking at an idea and thinking about it's impact. 

00:27:35
JAN GRAY Yeah, I think that's a really good, uh, image to have. Um, and again, thinking back on a, sort of practical weight management side of things, uh, it's not unusual for people to struggle with their weight. It's not to taste their food, not to be in the moment with the food. Uh, to eat it, to gobble it, to- 

00:28:00
MIKE SIMMONS I think you said something about this in one of the sessions, that if we eat fast, we can fool our stomach into thinking it hasn't had enough food. 

00:28:10
JAN GRAY Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I think when you slow down and savor, um, you can get so much more out of your food, you don't need as much. You have this sense that I, I'm eat-, you know I've eaten, I'm complete, um, I'm enjoying it. And, uh, one thing that really uh, struck me was Elaine said she likes to sit at the table and make the meal an occasion. Which I think is a really helpful place to start. Um, and it's one step along the route to her then believing that she deserves the best food for herself. If she could do that more often. 

00:28:50
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, and I'm just thinking eating while you're watching television, is a kind of surefire way of not really knowing how much you've eaten, and whether you're, whether you've had enough. You just keep eating. And I'm just thinking about that bit where she's sitting at the table, and we're seeing that that's good news, because she's not just kind of bolting food down in front of the television, but also when she was keeping a record, she was eating on her own. 

00:29:20
JAN GRAY Yeah, and that was a really poignant, um, reflection on Elaine's part, that she discovered that very often she eats on her own. So although she was there eating, and at the table, uh, because she was on her own, there was that sadness and I wonder in some ways whether or not it was the first time Elaine had had the chance to really acknowledge that. 

00:29:45
MIKE SIMMONS And that ties in with what you were saying about keeping records. Because it was only by, or my memory is, it was only when she started looking at daily records that it kept on saying, alone, alone, for each day. 

00:30:00
JAN GRAY And I don't think it's uncommon that people who comfort eat, or eat inappropriately, will be somehow eating and not really acknowledging the emotion that they're feeling. So, for Elaine, eating on her own it may well be that we need to explore, or would need to explore that that left with her a little bit more. Just, just to allow herself to express those emotions. 

00:30:30
MIKE SIMMONS Uh, and she talked about herself, and you've alluded to this, as someone who tried every diet. She-, she tried, and I guess that's a, a familiar kind of- 

00:30:40
JAN GRAY It's very, very common among people who're trying to manage their weight, and of course, if you are somebody who goes for a diet 100 percent, you know, I'm really going to do it, I'm really going to try, um, and, the diet doesn't work, because diets don't work, because it's about restricting yourself on something, it-, it's you're not really learning anything other than teaching yourself that you can't have something. Uh, and when, and when it's then tied up with love, as it was in the case of Elaine, you're reinforcing all those negative messages that you're giving to yourself all the time. 

00:31:25
MIKE SIMMONS The image that came into my head when you said that was something important to me is now pushed onto the other side of the chain link fence, so I can't get to it. So I might be thinner, I might not weigh so much, but actually I'm a good deal less happy, because I have no other means of sort of resource support to, so. 

00:31:45
JAN GRAY Yeah, and, and I think a lot of people who really struggle with weight loss, somehow see themselves as not normal. Somehow that that they are not like other people who can, um, who can-, who don't struggle to lose weight, who don't struggle with food. Um, and, somehow that in itself reinforces low mood and if you're using food as a method of comfort, you're, you're again you're setting yourself up for, in a situation where you're feeling really bad about yourself, you have no other means of self-soothing, other than through food. So there's a kind of cycle. 

00:32:30
JAN GRAY Completely, a vicious cycle, yeah. 

00:32:30
MIKE SIMMONS So, what it feels like your saying is that this is incredibly complex. The, within society we generally understand that if you weigh too much you just need to eat less, or you need to exercise more, or both. But it's much more complicated than that. 

00:32:50
JAN GRAY It is, and I think, I think this is where, um, society's got it wrong, because for some people, that, that's absolutely right, that they might just need some dietary advice, they might need some portion size advice, uh, they might need to up their activity a little bit more. Um, and for some people that works, but for other people, um, it's not as simple as that, I mean, um, as we said right at the start, you know, food can play a symbolic role for people. Food is a, has so many other meanings for people, and so for someone like Elaine, who's dieted off and on for decades, being told to eat less and exercise more, she knows that, she knows that. And so it would be, you know, it's, it's a waste to even attempt in that route with her. 

00:33:40
MIKE SIMMONS Right, so, uh, there's a lot in the media from time to time about food being, uh, presented on the packet explaining exactly what's in it, in a way that makes sense to the reader. And for some people, that's going to be useful. But for others, that's not the issue at all. 

00:34:00
JAN GRAY No, no I mean don't get me wrong, I think food labeling and people's understanding of food, and, and accurate understanding of food is, is important, and it may well be that we start working with emotions, um, and put in place a more healthy and helpful self-soothing mechanism, and then you start on the dietary advice, and then you start on the exercise, it, it's really important that if food has been the soothing, uh, a way of, um, emotional regulation for, for somebody, that you find a more helpful healthy way of expressing or regulating, or self-soothing, um, and once that's in place, then somebody is probably feeling more able, more confident and more competent to look at making some dietary changes. 

00:35:00
MIKE SIMMONS I see, um, from time to time, Elaine spoke about particular food as being good or bad. And then she kinda pulled back from that labeling. And I was kind of interested in where she was coming from on that. I mean, maybe we need her here to say, but what were you making of that. 

00:35:20
JAN GRAY Well I guess what was happening for Elaine was it was like her dieting head was telling her that foods were good and bad because that's of course what diets in the formal sense of the word do, they say you shouldn't eat that, you should eat that. Um, and she's quite right, no food is bad food, it's, you know, it's how you eat it, it's what you do with it. So, I, I guess there was a bit of a, a bit of an old pattern trying to, to surface, and let's be fair, everywhere in the media, you're bombarded with, you know, what's good, what's healthy, what you should eat, what you shouldn't eat, um, and if you're really desperate to try and do something about your weight, uh, you'll want to believe that. Um, you'll want to believe it's got to be that difficult , when in actual fact, it can be quite simple when you've got the other in place. 

00:36:20
MIKE SIMMONS Yeah, yeah. We saw just three sessions, or we recorded just three sessions, I'm wondering how you think that might have proceeded, uh, had we gone on. 

00:36:30
JAN GRAY Well I think the, I think the focus would have been on, um, Elaine experiencing more and more uh, putting herself first. Or at least treating herself equally on a par with others. Um, that might have felt more comfortable for her. A way of, um, you know, being as kind and compassionate to herself as, and caring towards herself as she was to other people. Um, so that then didn't feel like she was being selfish. Um, and then we would certainly start to look at some of the raising her activities, and sort of challenging this idea that there wasn't the time to be a little more active. Um, I, I know she said that she, uh, thought she was going to make a healthy sandwich and when she actually timed herself, it didn't take any longer to make the healthy sandwich as to have picked up something that wasn't quite so healthy. Um, so we might have used the same idea about doing some, some form of activity, exercise, that it doesn't necessarily have to be in the gym, or it doesn't you know, it could be something about 10 minutes a day, you know, how could you fit in 10 minutes a day doing something active. Um, to, so starting to set some small activity goals, and, and with regards to food, um, I know she said that she learned from other people, and I suppose one of the things we might have done as a homework task is to get her to get some recipe ideas from other people. Um, people she saw as having a healthy attitude to food, and perhaps having some practice, um, with some food, um, trying out food, deciding what she likes, new foods, I know she talked about that when times were tight, she didn't have a lot of money to to spend on food, um, so it might be that, um, I know with a dietician, um, get the dietician involved, get her to perhaps look at some, uh, economic healthy food choices. 

00:38:40
MIKE SIMMONS Because there was a sense that, uh, the good food uh, was given to Liam, and that's more expensive. And I have the leftovers, there's something about, yes, if, money's tight, then I eat, I mean, I'm using the phrase badly. 

00:39:00
JAN GRAY But good food doesn't have to cost a lot of money. 

00:39:00
MIKE SIMMONS No, I think we also saw something, uh, that ties in with what you were talking about earlier, around exercise. Where, she talked about the gym which felt like a pretty fearsome image to me, uh, has, well that's an example of exercise, but so much not for me, uh, but then the parking further away, or using the stairs and so forth, that's the kind of exercise I can use. 

00:39:30
JAN GRAY Yeah, and, I would like to encourage somebody to think if I'm doing 10 minutes a day that I hadn't planned to do, and I didn't do yesterday, what an achievement that is. 

00:39:40
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, yes. 

00:39:40
JAN GRAY And, if somebody's able to say that to themselves, you know, I did 10 minutes today, and feel good about themselves, they're more likely to try to do 10 minutes tomorrow. And it, it is, you know, if, if somebody keeps doing 10 minutes every day, you know that, that's over an hour's exercise that they hadn't planned to do that hasn't taken an hour, because they're only-, they are spreading it over the course of a week. And, you know, I have to think that she would feel better from it, and she would start to see the results. 

00:40:15
MIKE SIMMONS Feeling better, but also feeling better about herself at the same time. So, it's kind of almost sneaking up on you. It's just I'm doing a bit more, I'm doing a bit more. Oh, that's quite good. Can we start to pull all this together, because there seems to be some very important themes I don't want to lose sight of. There's something around structuring the sessions so that you both know where you're going, and what you're doing and so forth. And that ties in with the goals, the mood checks, and so forth, and people watching three sessions, or get a very clear sense of all that's going on. But then there's looking at what relationship food has with the person. How they see it. And it's within the structure that that work is done And that feels like the really important part of the work, the structure is a framework that it exists within. 

00:41:20
JAN GRAY The topics we talked about, you know, the subjects we talked about were very, very emotive, they were very close to Elaine, you know they were very much about Elaine's beliefs, and so in order to feel safe enough, to be able to talk about that has got to be a sense that this is a safe place, this is a safe structure that we can talk about that. And it was, it was almost like we were diving at different levels, you know we started off at her conscious awareness of her relationship with food, which I think Elaine had, and she had a, you know, a very good awareness of her experience of trying to lose weight, trying to manage weight. But then we delved a little bit deeper, and that, that was where I think Elaine hadn't been before, and I think that needed to be, um, you know, we needed to be at that, but then we needed to come back out again, because um, some sort of practical things to do. And also, Elaine's conscious awareness of what it is that we'd done in those sessions. 

00:42:30
MIKE SIMMONS Okay. Any final thoughts? 

00:42:30
JAN GRAY Um, yes, Mike, I think mainly I think I, it would be a hope that people, when they see somebody who's, uh, struggling to lose their weight, is that they are less judgmental, uh, that appreciate that is isn't a simply a case of eating less. And exercising more. That they perhaps take some time to think that this person might have deeper issues, might have, uh, enough self-loathing that they, they don't need prejudice, they don't need judgment from, from others, that there's something about being able to treat that person compassionately, um, and my hope would be that that it would be recognized that is a problem, that, for people, that it's, it's not helped by uh, the food that you can buy, and plenteous amounts in the shops. But it is something about uh, the person's uh, deeper hunger. 

00:43:40
MIKE SIMMONS Right. Okay. Jan, thank you very much.
