Seven Generations Center of Excellence in Native Behavioral Health Violence in Indian Country Jacqueline Gray, Ph.D. Choctaw/Cherokee Associate Director Indigenous Programs Teacher's College Med. Winter Roundtable February 13, 2015 Introduction Every community- including both tribal and non-tribal communities-experience violence to some degree. That is, violence is not an Indian problem. Violence is a human problem. For tribal communities, we are also part of a larger federal system that has a significant impact on how we are able to protect our communities. 

00:02:05
JACQUELINE GRAY Thank you very much, it's great to be here. It may be feel right at home with weather, ah, they was gonna like this one I left to come here yesterday. And, ah, I'm like someone, someone from, ah, upstate sent me an email and said, "You-- it's gonna be really cold you need to make sure you bring le-- ah, layers and heavy, heavy coat and all of this." and I'm like, "Do you know where I'm coming from?" Okay. Anyway thank you very much for coming. And, ah, just talk a little bit about some of the violence Indian country, uhm, we all of our communities tribal and non-tribal experience violence to some degree. And it's not the violence, it's not an Indian problem it's a human problem. And our tribal communities were part of a larger federal system that has a lot of impact on how we protect our communities. And I'll be talking about some of those things that impact working an Indian country. 

00:03:15
Objectives • Overview of types of violence; • Discuss risk and protective factors associated with violence that are unique to tribal communities; Key Exposures to Violence Children - Suicide - Child maltreatment - Sexual victimization - Family violence - Gang violence - Bullying - Conventional crime - - School violence (including school shootings) - Involvement with juvenile justice system 

00:03:15
JACQUELINE GRAY So I'll go over some of the types of violence, discuss some of the risk and protective factors associated, ah, with that violence that are unique in Indian country. Identify some of the barriers and challenges to reducing that violence. And then identify some strategies to increase the availability of culturally appropriate resources for Indian country. When we talk about violence some of the things that impact our children, our suicide, child abuse, child maltreatment, sexual family violence, gang violence, bullying, school violence including school shootings. How many of you have heard about school shootings in Indian country? Most of the things in Indian country don't make the news. There was, uhm, a mass shooting in New Town North Dakota, 2 weeks before New Town Connecticut. But I bet none of you heard about it. 

00:04:30
Key Exposures to Violence continued Women - Intimate Partner Violence - Sexual Assault (including Trafficking) Other American Indians and Alaska Natives - Homicide - Assault Overview of Statistics AI/AN are 2.5 times as likely to experience violent crimes; AI/AN are at least 2 times more likely to experience rape or sexual assault crimes compared to all other races; 61% of AI/AN women have been assaulted in their lifetimes 34% of AI?AN women will be raped in their lifetimes; 39% of AI/AN women will be subjected to violence by an intimate partner in their lifetimes; 17% AI/AN women reported being stalked during their lifetimes; Among AI/An women victims of rape or sexual assault, an average of 67% describe the offender as non-Native; 

00:04:35
JACQUELINE GRAY When we talk about women intimate partner violence and sexual assault especially associated with trafficking is very high in Indian country. And among American Indians and Alaska Natives in general homicide and assault are very high rates. When we talk about some of the statistics American Indians and Alaska Natives are two and a half times as in likely to experience violent crime as a general population. And are at least two times more likely to experience rate or sexual assault crimes compared to all other races. Sixty-one percent of native American women had been assaulted in their lifetimes and 34% will be rate in their li-- lifetimes. Thirty-nine percent of American Indian women are subjected to violence by an inti-- intimate partner in their lifetimes. And one in six are reported have reported being stopped. And among raped victims two-thirds describe the offender as non-native. And as you can see at the bottom, ah, 57% of the offenders were white, 10% black and only a third native. 

00:06:15
Overview of Statistics Among Native women victims of assault, an average of 63% describe the offenders as non-native; 46% of people living on reservations in 2010 were non-Native. 

00:06:20
JACQUELINE GRAY With native women that are victims of assault, 63% describe the victim as non-native. And here again, 55% white, 8% black and slightly higher percent that are native. And a lot of people don't realized that almost half of people living on reservations are non-Indian. Oh, the land are lot of that was sold off and so there are white owners and partners of natives that are non-Indian that live on the reservations of Indian communities that are on the reservations their maybe non-Indians that live there as well. So taking into account that another piece that I'll get into some of the policy issues that, ah, until the passage of the tribal land order act whites on Indian land could not be prosecuted except by the federal government and it had to be a federal crime that they had committed. So most of the time murder or assault were about the only things that could be charge. So we didn't get, ah, ah, prosecution of those crimes in Indian country. Uhm, I grew up in Oklahoma and it was well known, ah, in the small rural schools that if you wanted to go drinking you go get your beer or alcohol or whatever and go to Indian land and they couldn't arrest you. And South Dakota is had-- has had a great effect the white clay. Have any of you heard the white clay? It's a border town that's right on the border of one of the reservations. And there's a white maybe six people that live in the town makes millions of dollars a year. They sell alcohol to people from the reservation and exploit their prices. There's a-- it really had an impact on the community. Suicide is another factor. It's a second leading cause of death in American Indian and Alaska Native youth. And the suicide among adolescence is higher than all other races. For whites and most other races suicide rates increase with age you know there's a blip that adolescence but then it really increases with rates. For American Indians it picks with adolescence and then goes down after that. And as you can see from the graph that the native suicide rates over the last 20 years have been higher than any group. In fact I'm got a phone call this afternoon that one of the reservations, ah, that I work with head five suicides last week and the last two were 12 year old girls. A neighboring reservation, ah, through social media discover of suicide of fact with nine adolescent girls, one have completed suicide and they been able to intervene. Last I've heard what they got five or six of the others and they were show trying to get that the last few. And some of the other reservations are very concerned that this with social the media and everything will spread to their reservation as well and so they got a lot of concern of what's going on right now. Ah, ah, just before thanks giving of in fact over thanks giving I'll spent the week at the reservation where they have been a mass shooting is about, ah, result of interpersonal violence that, ah, the person shot his partner the person that well and, and three other people besides himself. And it's really hard in our communities because were related to both sides-- were related to both the victims and the shooters. And so how do you fe-- you all these mixed emotions around all of this. Ah, a lot of anger and treats of retribution and things like this going on when there's that type of situation. And we really-- it's hard to get assistance to come in because one their aren't that many, ah, native behavioral health professionals. Two we cover you know, a few over a very large area and three were dealing with the same things that wherever were working that, ah, were already stress out from that and then to go and extend that into a crisis in another community is even more stressful but we go because it needs to be done. And were there to help. 

00:11:40
Protective Factors Cultural identity Familial relationships Education Employment Community Schools What else? 

00:11:45
JACQUELINE GRAY So then some of the protective factors that we found in working with natives include cultural identity, family relationships, education, employment, community, schools, what were very collective is in our society. So those, those things were there's lots of interaction and connections tend to help us, ah, be more protective. Ah, as far as education in the decoders, we have the highest high graduation rate for non-Indians and the lowest graduation rate from high school of Indians in the country. Those disparities we see across Indian country. So there a lot of things in the more we can a-- as we said earlier this morning then the key note the more we can engage and connect people when those communities the more involve we get one another. The more were up to, ah, address some of this issues. 

00:12:50
Risk factors Several distinct forms of trauma have been identified in Indian Country: - Cultural Trauma - Historical Trauma - Intergenerational Trauma - Current Trauma 

00:12:55
JACQUELINE GRAY So some of the risk factors that are unique in Indian country are cultural trauma, the historical trauma, intergenerational trauma and then we have the current traumas. When I work with some of the reservations around of some of the shootings, some of the suicide, ah, clusters and things like this it isn't just that one event it's all those others that came before it. There may have been a car accident and loss of life. There may have been another suicide or another shooting or something else that happened, ah, short time before that and it just like build on one another and you never get over one you never grieve one lost before your hit with another. The other thing with the intergenerational trauma and historical trauma-- excuse me, uhm, when we talk about natives being place on the reservations and then things-- the way the culture was set up is you know, everything was focus on the children. The children were the center of a culture. The mothers in the care of the children. The grandmothers and grandfathers were educators and more focus on support of, of the children. The father is around that outside if you think about his concentric circles and so the father is around that outside if you think about his concentric so called. So when the father around the outside were the providers and the defenders. Well then after their place on the reservation children were taking away and place in the boarding schools. If you take that center out where do you focus? So the parenting was lost, the focus of what their the role was. All of those losses and then the children that went to those boarding schools were abused neglected. They are culture was ripped away from them. Their spirituality all of those things that there's all of these emptiness this lose inside. And then if you go back home how do you function? You don't know what that culture is or how to interact. So all of those lo-- those losses build up overtime and those end up being transmitted historical trauma was really describe first around of the, ah, the Jews after the World War II that some of that trauma was carried on to other generations following that. Natives have had this going on for 500 years that we've had those continue losses that we really haven't got to, to grieve and to, to deal with. 

00:15:55
Trust Responsibility An understanding of the unique political status of AI/AN nations is crucial to the development of effective responses to the needs of tribal communities. The United States has legal obligations to Indian tribes that are grounded in the United States Constitution, treaties, federal statutes, and Supreme Court decisions. 

00:16:00
JACQUELINE GRAY And as I was talking about earlier the uni-- American Indians are the one ethnic group that has a unique relationship with the United States government. It's a trust relationship. In that when we saw in treaties with the U.S. government giving up our land they agreed that they would do certain things. Part of that is sovereignty that we have the right to govern ourselves. And you can think that is equivalent to a state right to government state. We have, ah, a number of different levels were we are able to do those types of things. Some of-- almost all of the treaties talk about providing health, education, as long as the grass grows and the rivers flow. That doesn't just mean seasonally. So the United State has legal obligations to the tribes that are grounded in the constitution, the treaties, the federal statutes and the supreme court organization. Based on that do you know, what groups are guaranteed health care by our government? American Indians, veterans those are about the only ones. Who gives them? I didn't include the slides on, on the amounts spent per person per capita on health care. But if you look at government employees, ah, BA, prisons across you know, the health care provided an Indian health service. Indian health service per capita gets about half what federal prisoners get as far as health care. So not only our is there a shortages as far as the health care but also, ah, only about 25% of need is provided as far as mental health care in Indian country. So we have a shortage of workers, shortage of services. In fact of when I testified before congress last year one of the things that I was telling them was I had tribal members telling me how appointments with people who had attempted suicide were being cancelled in order to have appointments with people who were threatening suicide. That's how short the services are. 

00:18:55
Trust Responsibility This trust relationship recognizes tribal governments as distinct political entities with the inherent power to govern themselves. One component of the federal trust responsibility, as enumerated in many treaties and codified in the Snyder Act of 1921, is to ensure the "health, safety, and welfare" of AI/AN peoples. 

00:19:00
JACQUELINE GRAY And the trust relationship recognizes governments as distinct political entities that I've talk about that sovereignty and one component of their responsibility that's in that the treaties its and its decode Snyder Act of 1921, is to sure-- ensure the health, safety and welfare of American Indian people. There are reservations that cover thousands of square miles that may have two police officers to cover all of those thousands of square miles. So it's really hard that something's happen that one end to get there.

Overview of VAWA 2013 Tribal Provisions Special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction (SDVCJ) over non-Indian perpetrators of domestic and dating violence as well as certain violations of protective orders - Narrowly defined Pilot Project & Effective Dates Intertribal Working Group 

00:19:50
JACQUELINE GRAY Some other legislation that's helped in the last couple of years is VAWA the violence against Womens Act in 2013. And it provided for tribes special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction for non-Indian perpetrators of domestic and dating violence and other certain violation for protective orders. For the first time natives who were threatened with violence from a non-native could get a protective order in Indian country. And right now is a pilot project so it's only in some locations and its only for a certain length of time and there's a working group that's overviewing some of that to determine that it needs to be extended throughout Indian country. 

00:20:40
Violence Against Elders Types of abuse and neglect Who is at risk for abuse What is different about elder abuse in Indian Country Barriers to addressing 

00:20:45
JACQUELINE GRAY Violence against our elders. I have a number of people when I talk about this they say well do-- I thought natives respected their elders. Well that's the culture. Is that we respect and honor our elders. However, the dominant culture, the media all of these other things impact our youth just like they do every other youth. So looking at the types of abused and whose at risk and what's different in Indian country and some of those barriers? The types of abused they got physical abuse which has to do with the physical force or threats of physical force or phy-- a bodily injury pain impairment. So it can be acts of violence but not exclusively bad hitting, beating, pushing, shoving, shaking, slapping, hitting, punching, burning inappropriate use of drugs so chemical restraint is physical abuse. Ah, physical restraint force speeding, physical punishment are all examples. And so when we ask an Indian country you know, what are some examples of physical abuse some tribal judges said well the drug son hits his elderly parent. Or the elder was hit by an adult child. Or the elderly man was dimension was hit by his wife. Okay. But then when we talk with elders we heard things well the daughter hit the elder because of their needs in their health they were just frustrated. The granddaughter slapping the elder. The drug taking alcohol use leads to yelling and hitting about by other family members. The next type of abuse is sexual abuse. And that's the non-consensual sexual contact of any kind within elderly person. Some of the examples that we heard from the judges had to do with right. But then we really didn't hear much all about that. And I started hearing from health directors and others in the community about elderly women who sometimes relative sometimes people they didn't even know high on meth would break in and raped elderly grandmothers. But they were too ashamed they didn't want to admit it and that they would talk with them for hours before they even agree to go to the health clinic to be check out to make sure that t hey were physically, okay. So there's more than what we hear about going on in Indian country. Emotional abused, psychological abused are define as anguish or pain through distress, through verbal or non-verbal acts. Verbal assaults, insults threats, intimidation, humiliation, harassment. Many we hear you know, drinking mad relatives enter the elders home yelling and scaring the elder. Wrong children moving in with an elder drinking, fighting, taking money, chasing away the care givers. Family violence and the elders if right to testify. Many times these elders don't wanna testify because that family member that's the caregiver is the only one they have to take care of them. Do not have that family member do it means that if they have to go into a nursing home or something like that they may have to be transported many miles away from their home whether isolated from family, from friends, from the community, the culture and everything like that and then they don't usually last very long when that happens. I have a good friend that tells a story about, ah, how his dad, ah, after he'd had a stroke he was in the nursing home and was begging them to take him home. And said 1 day her mom took him out was gonna told them she's gonna take him for a walk and drove the car up and kidnapped him from the nursing home and took him home. But when his son was talking with him he said, "You know, 1 day I was sitting there and I was leaning this way and they came over and they strike to me up." And I started leaning this way they came over and they strike me up. He couldn't even passed gas in that nursing home. You know, there-- just gotta have to go with it sometimes but then and they took him and he live another 14 years at home when he was surrounded by family. So sometimes that is intentional but being taken away from those things and that support of that family environment can be, ah, detrimental. Neglect is another form of abuse, and it's the refusal or failure to fulfill that persons obligations or duties to care for the elder. And there's also-- it can also include the fiduciary responsibilities and that leads into the financial exploitation. Ah, either not paying the bills or taking the money and spending that for something else. Uhm, misusing the funds, taking money to buy a medicines and either keeping the medicines and selling them somewhere else or not paying for things and keeping the money. 

00:27:15
[sil.] 

00:27:20
JACQUELINE GRAY The other thing with the neglect is there something called self-neglect and were seeing a lot of that. Where the elder maybe living on their own and their no longer able to take care of themselves but yet they don't want to admit they need help or something. I know we-- were told a story last year about, uhm, a woman in the middle of the winter and last year was just unbelievably cold and some of the people that she usually saw at the Senior Nutrition Center had seen her for couple a days. And nobody it heard from her. And so they mention something to the elder protection team and one of the members of the elder protection team went after her house she didn't answer the door. But it was unlock and she went on-- he went on in he found her lying on the floor she had fallen, she couldn't get up, could it tend to a fire, and it frozen to the floor. Now, he was able to get her lose and get her transported to the hospital and she fully recovered. And that were able to work with her to get house in where she can get care and things like that. But that is a matter of hours and she would not have survive. These are the kinds of things that end up being self-neglect and were seeing they're talking about having more and more elder, ah, death review teams. And what their finding in the areas where they have those are more and more with self-neglect. And then one of the types of the-- of the neglect that you don't really hear about much but its brought up to me several times well I've been working in Indian country and suggesting that, ah, this is something that we need to really pay attention to the spiritual abuse. I've had a lot of investigators and, and adult protective services workers tell me, oh, that's emotional or psychological or neglect. And I'm like no it goes to a deeper level it's more that so lonely. Anything that interferes with that spiritual growth including corruption of a person's value system. Things like you know, an elder not being taken to ceremonies or community events that social isolation from those. Uhm, family not being allowed to conduct ceremonies at the elders bed side. Taking ceremonial items for sale or used without the elders permission all of those go much deeper than psychological, emotional or neglect. 

00:30:15

00:30:20
Violence Against Elders continued National Indigenous Elder Justice Initiative - Vision: "Restore respect and dignity by honoring Indigenous elders." 

00:30:25
JACQUELINE GRAY I hope you like the pictures that was ways to kind a lighten up some of this because we have some great elders. Other things as far as, uhm, I as was said, when I was introduced that I direct the National Indigenous Elder Justice Initiative. And our vision is to restore respect and dignity by honoring indigenous elders. We been funded there were in our, our fourth year now. And just 2 years ago of the 565 federally recognized tribes in the United States and over 400 that are state recognized to unrecognized only 50 have tribal elder abuse codes so we have a big job. And were working with tribes now to try to help establish codes and develop programs. 

00:31:25
Violence Against Children The litany of trauma-related social ills in Indian Country is well-documented and paints a stark picture of the daily experiences of AI/AN children and youth - There is little comprehensive data on rates of PTSD for AI/AN youth. However, a study of Native American sixth graders from one reservation found that 75% had clinically significant levels of PTSD 

00:31:25
JACQUELINE GRAY The other into spectrum in violence against children. Again we have a lot of trauma. I've talk about suicide, child abuse, neglect, uhm, a lot of accidents, a lot of child death at early ages due to accidents suicide and other trauma's. There's not a very much data. The, ah, As American child, adverse childhood experience is such what it is. I'm just American child study no there was not it. But, ah, really there haven't been very many native tribes there is only one county in that study that, ah, was on the reservation. And-- but what we do now is there is just not much data out there at all and it's really hard to get data on what violence is going on unless their, ah, police report. So unlike I said jurisdictional issues is this county, is the state, is this tribal, is this federal get so confusing is to even who supposed to take a call, who supposed to respond that a lot of it falls to the cracks and doesn't even get reported. So it's really hard to get data on what's happening. 

00:32:55
Violence Against Children Bullying and gang violence is rampant is some AI/AN communities. Violence Against Children Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death in AI/AN youth. Suicide rate among AI/AN adolescents is higher than all other races. Indian Child Welfare Act AG Task Force on AIAN Children Exposed to Violence S. 1622 Commission on Native Children 

00:33:00
JACQUELINE GRAY Bullying and gang violence is rampant in some of our communities. And again the suicide it rate highest in 15 to 24 year olds and were seeing more and more suicide clusters. And I hear elders talking about the suicide spirit comes into the community. And until it did moves on into another community they end up having many of those suicides. The Indian Child Welfare Act is there to produce or protect children of it was place into a fact because children were being taken from the reservations and given the families that were not Indian. And they had no-- grew up with no connection to their culture, with no connection to any of where they came from. Uhm, so, ah, Senator Heitkamp from North Dakota has proposed and native, ah, child commission to review some of the issues going on in Indian country with native children. 

00:34:20
Models Care Best Practice Models Working in Communities Implementing a Trauma-Informed Care System in Your Tribal Community Coeur D'Alene Youth At Risk Tracking Program (Strengthening The Spirit Program) Equine Assisted Therapy, Rosebud Horse Society Integrated Cultural Model Emotional WEST SOUTH COMMUNITY FAMILY INDIVIDUAL EAST Social 

00:34:25
JACQUELINE GRAY So what are some of the models of care. Some of the best practice models that are working in our communities. The Trauma Informed Care System, ah, project making medicine done by, ah, Dr. David Foote(ph) out of the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center trains behavioral health professionals to do trauma focus cognitive behavioral therapy, parent child interaction therapy with, ah, with those provider so that they can do evidence base practice that culturally adapted in Indian country. The Coeur D'Alene Youth At Risk Tracking Program strengthening the spirit program, helps to track and keep up with what's going on with some of those at risk children to help get them involve in things, ah, for more positive outcome. In the plains were seeing a lot of the return of the whole societies doing Equine Assisted Therapy and engaging youth with that. This is the model that I developed several years ago that really takes a look at from a cultural prospective the orange is the colonization, and the different things that have impacted our families, our co-- our culture individuals. And if you look at spirituality is the center of who we are this dealing with social looking at some of the traditional activity is sweat lodges, purification's, pow wow, talking circles things like that. To the south is the nurturing so the prevention information education health. To the West the emotional and here's where we introduced the evidence-based practices, grief and loss, parenting(ph) and skills, anger management some of the treatment modalities. And to the North is the mental that traditional healer, the elders the creation stories that the story telling. All of those types of things that come in, ah, and help us with as far as the mental issues. But utilizing a model to try to help within the culture looking at how do we have balance in our lives that one isn't over than more than the other. And that also how we, ah, how we used the culture to help overcome some of those things. 

00:37:20
AI/An Prevention, Treatment, and Rehabilitation Interventions ✓ Story Telling ✓ Talking Circles ✓ Sweat Lodge ✓ Ceremonies and Ritual • Purification • Passages • Naming • Grieving ✓ Drumming, singing, dancing ✓ Vision Quest ✓ flute playing/meditation ✓ Reconciliation ✓ Mentoring ✓ Service learning ✓ Traditional Experiences Preservation 

00:37:25
JACQUELINE GRAY Some of the other things that we see for prevention treatment, rehab interventions, storytelling. Uhm, we found that the story telling really helps for prospective taking, for understanding how different things relate. Talking circles, the sweat lodge various ceremonies and rituals including purification, passages, naming, grieving. And natives we will be given a name at the beginning of our lives about we may earn three to five names throughout our lives. Just a couple of years ago I was given a name by the big the foot. And then that name is something not only that you earn but that you're to-- live up to. And my name is Weaver Woman Wisdom Walker which is may a heavy burden to carry with all of that. Vision quest, drumming, singing, dancing, flute playing, reconciliation, mentoring, service learning, traditional experiences, preservation all of those can be weave in to helping build those communities those connections. Help to developed that those protective factors and resilience in our communities. 

00:39:00
Best Practice Models Working in Communities continued Questions? Jacque Gray, PhD Jacqueline gray@med.und.edu Seven Generations Center of Excellence Center for Rural Health University of North Dakota 

00:39:05
JACQUELINE GRAY So some of the best practice models that are working in the communities. So-- some of those are working in the communities. But what kinds of questions do you have about violence in Indian country? Because I wanted this to have an idea of what you need are to. There are a lot of issues of that's like working in Indian country as a researcher in the last I was a 5 year were making some real changes in how researchers viewed because a view point before that was more what we've been getting guinea pig all our lives we've never seen any benefit from many of these people come in they take what they want they leave we never heard from them again. There's no trust there. And really working to build a model were we go and we build the relationship first be-- and then we hear what the communities what really doing a travel base participatory model or community base participatory model. Where we hear what they want for research rather than a researcher go in and say, "This is what we want to do." I know I was working with one tribe that around getting permission to do some research in their community. And their were like, yeah, we, we really didn't understand this other group that was a one that was one information to come in. It was a study on in continents and they didn't know, uhm, we didn't know why they chose us to do it with. You know, is there something you know, it, it felt like it was an insult they were just looking for place to do the research in Indian country that's all it was. But how this perceive by that community is what are they saying about us that they're doing this. Uhm, and now it-- I've work enough in Indian country I've responded to a lot of those communities when they've been in crisis. I've been there, I've try to do what I could. We've like taking students things like that. And they know that I've been around now for over 15 years that they start calling me and say, "We've got and we wanna get it done. Can you come and help us?" So I've known to take a long weekend like this one and drive 700 miles to meet with the tribe, to talk about what it was that they wanted to do and then drive back just so we could be sit down and talk about what it was that I can hear what it was that they wanted to do and how to do that. We really have work in building those relationships. There are others that don't do that. So you know, it's important that trust is important it can be established but you don't just walk in and say, "I want this you work with the relationship and that's first." It's not short term research. The Tribal Law and Order Act ideally which supposed to address some of that but very few tribes have the money to implement that. Ah, right, now for most tribes the most that they can sentence anyone to for violation of a law in the reservation is a 1 year in jail. So it didn't matter what it is. Ah, The Tribal Law and Order Act they have to have in place that there's a legally train judge, there's, ah, legally trained, ah, prosecutor or legally trained defense attorney and to provide all of that. Ah, is very expensive and they aren't that many that they can get to serve on those roles and so very few tribes have really implemented The Tribal Law and Order Act. Ah, with that it really increases the amount as the sentences that can be done. But not the sen-- not that many places have it in, in effect so it's basically still you know, right federal law then they could file federal charges. But other than that they doesn't get anything. When I've talk with (inaudible ) country and I say, "You know, how many of you have been touch by suicide?" Just about everybody in the room raises their hand. I don't think you find that in other communities. And it's, it's really because of how closely related everyone is that it impacts everybody. Ah, what-- when I responded at the shooting in over thanks giving we, ah, had a talking circle with the response team that I lead, ah, the first day I was down there. And you know, its above them you know, talk about their response listed you know, run toward to you know, what can be done, how could-- what we can we set up? What needs to happen? And finally this one, ah, social worker that had spoken said, well my response is wasn't to run toward it, it was to run away. Because the day before this happened was the sentence seen of the man who murdered my 3 year old granddaughter or what murdered granddaughter 3 years ago. And so it brought all of that up that was fresh from the sentence seen of this man that it just happen when this shooting took place and she didn't have the capacity to be at help to anybody at that time. She just had to back away. And we, we supported her for that. But me we have to recognized that. So you know, even the helpers are tied in and impacted by all of it and it rate makes it really difficult to deal with all of the tragedy. Uhm, you know, we, we try to have postvention program and things like that but, ah, and like with that community when all of the suicide started up I got on the phone that they have been saying, you need to know this is going on and just to be aware so it doesn't trigger something else in your community because you just had this lost bag in November. So being aware of those things some people respond to it others don't. I think that's pretty much the same. Well thank you very much I. My contact information Wado, thank you.
