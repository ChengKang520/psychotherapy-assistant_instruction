Working with the Body in Analytic Therapy Alexander Lowen, M.D. 

00:00:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Uh, good morning. I'm Alexander Lowen and this is a patient of mine who came here from New York for this presentatsion. His name is John Caputo. 

00:00:55
JOHN CAPUTO Hello. 

00:00:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Uh, so this will be, um, an example of a bioenergetic session as I would conduct it in my office and it's gonna be a real session. Uh, it can't be as, you know, it won't include everything that goes on in therapy because it's limited to this one hour presentation, but you'll get an understanding, I think, from watching what happens of what bioenergetic analysis is about. Now, when a patient comes into the office, as John does, uh, we say hello and I ask him what's going on with him. But let's assume this is the first session. So I would say to John, "What made you come to this therapy? What made you come to in to see me?" 

00:01:40
JOHN CAPUTO Well, the, uh, immediate thing that got me to see you was, uh, one of your books that I read, the one on narcissism. And upon reading it, I felt that, uh, you were sort of on to something that perhaps not only was troubling me terribly but was permeating the entire culture. So, I sort of felt that although I didn't know how much, how deep into my own therapy I wanted to go, I felt that this was, uh, an easy way to approach it. 

00:02:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Okay. Had you been to therapy previously? 

00:02:05
JOHN CAPUTO I had done some, uh, Reiki therapy, uh, sporadically over, over the years but nothing consistent and I had gotten, uh, you know, a character analysis of being, uh, in an aural structure with a narcisstic personality and, um, at that, at that point I kind of stopped the therapy and that may was, maybe was two years ago. 

00:02:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. And no other therapy then? No verbal therapy? 

00:02:30
JOHN CAPUTO No, um, no. No, no, no. No. None at all. I've done a lot of body work, uh, in terms of Alexander. I've been Rolfed. I've done some Aston patterning. Um, my body, for me in looking in the mirror, even when I didn't understand the characterological, um, armoring and the structuring I could see was out. Um, the relationship to my head, to my neck and, um, my pelvis and the way I stood, um, just from my, uh, physical standpoint never looked like it was stacked right to me. 

00:03:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Okay. How old are you, John? 

00:03:05
JOHN CAPUTO I'm 53. 

00:03:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Married? 

00:03:05
JOHN CAPUTO Uh, no. I'm divorced. 

00:03:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. And could you tell us a little about your, the marriage and the divorce? What led to it? 

00:03:10
JOHN CAPUTO Sure. Well, I've been divorced a long time, uh, almost 23 years. Um, I can't recognize the person that was married and divorced then, uh, but I can tell you something about the, um, perhaps the effect of, uh, sexuality, um, you know, had on it for me. For me, uh, sexuality had been, uh, for the most part a performance. Uh, I used to always wonder about what I was supposed to do and how I was supposed to do it, uh, to get the woman in the relationship to care about me and in the beginning that works fine but, uh, it's not really based in any, anything deeply. And then I, the relationships didn't last. They ended because you can't continue the performance, uh, on infinitum. Um, so, I was kinda left in a situation of, um, you know, wondering what is really going on here? 

00:04:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Now, can you tell us a little about what you do for a living or have done? Just... 

00:04:10
JOHN CAPUTO Sure. Um, I was in market research. I used to pretest commercials before they went on the air for, uh, most of my life. Uh, I, uh, at some point perhaps about five, four of five years ago, um, I just lost the creative edge to be able to do anything. I just simply couldn't do it anymore and I decided to follow a second career. Well, I got the brochure for Marymount College in the mail, uh, which was to become an addictions counsellor and I completed and did the program at Marymount an then became a counsellor of people who had alcoholic and drug si-, addictions and I found that, uh, I couldn't do it very well, um, and I started to realize that, that perhaps the reason I couldn't do it well, I didn't feel that I was getting anywhere with it is because I saw, you know, my own problems connected with, uh, addictions, um, and I had decided at that time, which was less, or less than a year ago, about ten months ago, to, uh, stop completely. I was fortunate enough to be in a position where I did not have to work to earn a living and, um, I had read, uh, Dr. Lowen's book so I decided to, uh, you know, put it all aside and, um, you know, follow this idea to try to become whoever I am. 

00:05:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. And you don't know who, who you are, do you? 

00:05:20
JOHN CAPUTO No. No, I only get small pieces of it now and again but, uh, no I honesty don't. 

00:05:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. And tell me a little about your childhood, uh... 

00:05:30
JOHN CAPUTO Alright. 

00:05:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. How many children were in your family? 

00:05:30
JOHN CAPUTO Okay. Uh, there were two children. Uh, I had a young, I have a younger brother that's two years younger. Um, my parents were this way...My father was, like, insanely jealous and a very terrified person. My mother was, uh, not available physically. The only time my mother touched me was when she washed my hair because I couldn't shampoo it myself as a child. Uh, but she had, um, very... she had a type of eyes that flashed a lot and, um, her energy always seemed off to me, like always, I was afraid that she might see me or I might see her or something was amiss there and, you know, my father would go into some kind of jealous rage. So, I spent, um, you know, most of the time trying to figure out how I was supposed to look, feel and think, uh, to cause the least amount of problems around the house. 

00:06:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. And how long have you been divorced now? 

00:06:30
JOHN CAPUTO Twenty-three years. 

00:06:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. And have you been involved with other female relationships? 

00:06:30
JOHN CAPUTO Yes. Yes. Yes, I have. Uh, I was engaged to one woman for, uh, almost seven years and that went on and off and on and off and on and off. Um, the... You know, mostly I lived in my head. I lived in my head as a protection against, uh, you know, things I might feel that would overwhelm me and, uh, I guess truly in a relationship that only goes so far and then, um, I, I couldn't do it anymore. In fact, most of the relationships I've had, um, when you really don't know who you are it becomes very difficult. You don't know whose script you're following or, um, so, you know, for the ta-, for the time being right now I'm still finding out who I am. 

00:07:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Now, in your work with your body, say, prior to meeting me, what did you learn about your physical state? 

00:07:30
JOHN CAPUTO Well, I was very, I was very, um... 

00:07:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Were you overweight at any time? 

00:07:35
JOHN CAPUTO Yeah, uh, yes. I'm probably about the same weight I'm at, I'm at now, which is, um, about 20 pounds overweight, I would say. I had recenty gained some weight because I smoked cigars and drank a lot of coffee and I gave that up about a month ago but, uh, as a result I gained about ten pounds. Um, I would say my weight probably hasn't really changed too much. The, the only... The awareness I had in my body was that I, my feet were not in good contact with the ground. I had tried taking Karate lessons and, um, I could, I could work the arm movements fair, fairly enough but I couldn't move my feet well at all and, uh, I realized I didn't have contact with the ground. Also, my eye contact with, uh, people in general was, um, I'd have to think about doing it. It would not happen automatically. I was afraid either to see the or to let me see, let them see me, so, um, I hadn't, you know, noticed that after doing, um, you know, a fair amount of body work. 

00:08:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. And what happened in that relationship, that, uh, seven-year relationship with the woman? 

00:08:40
JOHN CAPUTO Uh, well, um, the, the, circumstances were such she was a, um, she was waiting for an appointment from the governor in Pennsylvania to be a judge and she lived with her mother in Pennsylvania and I lived in New York City and, um, she was a political person, uh, and she was a triple Gemini and she couldn't make up her mind and wore several hats all at one time. I think the, the attraction for me in the relationship was that I sort of didn't know what was gonna happen from one day to, to the next and that seemed to, kind of, parallel what my childhood was like. She seemed to be, her, um, moods were somewhat like my mother's. Um, so I continued in it for, um, about seven years until she became a judge and then I found out that the oly way she was gonna marry me is if we lived across the street from her mother, which, uh, since her mother and I did not get along at all... Her mother didn't want her to marry anyone, needless to say. Um, that was, that was the end of it and it, and it ended at that point. 

00:09:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. And is that when you got depressed? Was it after a subsequent relationship? 

00:09:50
JOHN CAPUTO Oh, no, no. The, there was one relationship I had after that, uh, where I truly felt what I amounted to be totally and completely in love with someone, um, and I, I totally or whatever surrender meant, that, that's what I felt. But it was a woman who was considerably younger than me, about twenty years, and, um, she, uh, as I tried to get closer to her and fall more in love with her, and it was one of the few times sexually I didn't perform. I, I just, sort of, let it happen. Um, I figured, well, the other thing hadn't worked for me really well, but I guess when she felt how intense I was and noted the seriousness of, uh, how I felt, uh, she backed off, um, terribly. Um, it was not what she wanted. She wanted something much more casual and, um, also when I, I had remarked to her about sexually what she was feeling and she said yes, that was fine and that was what she wanted but that was divorced from her emotions, that she could separate her sexuality from what she felt. You know, it's funny, when I told women friends of mine what had happened, they said us, we women have been complaining about that all our lives, that that's what men do, but, uh, so this was kind of, uh, the reverse of that and upon that relationship ending I was suicidal. I mean, uh, you know, I considered committing suicide. Actually, I thought about how I would do it, which would be the way to, uh, asphyxiate myself, you know, tying a bag around my head. 

00:11:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Were you... And you were depressed, too at that time, I think? 

00:11:20
JOHN CAPUTO Oh, I was terribly so. Terribly, terriblly so. 

00:11:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. A sense of despair about life? 

00:11:25
JOHN CAPUTO Total despair. Total disappointment. 

00:11:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Yes. 

00:11:30
JOHN CAPUTO It was, um, it was quite a time. Um, actually a book actually helped me to get, to get by it. I read Camille Paglia's book on sexual persona and, uh, realized that the, the problem and power of sexuality, you know, wasn't mine alone and that this had befallen many people throughout many times. So, I got enormous comfort. I actually wrote her a letter. I got enormous comfort in, uh, in, in the fact that this wasn't unique to me and that I somehow could relieve myself of taking responsibility for the state I was in and therefore, um, you kow, I obviously didn't commit suicide. 

00:12:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Yeah. Now, eh, John's story isn't that unique. You have to look to really understand the factors in his personality that could lead to such a severe sense of not knowing who you are and even suicidal feelings, you know? And you can get that if you study John, look at his body and as I look at his face, uh, he talks very well, by the way. I mean, he's, uh, he's sharp, he's clear, he's with it in words, but the face is relatively dead as an expressive part of him. Uh, he smiles. That's okay. See? 

00:12:55
JOHN CAPUTO Not for long. 

00:12:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Huh? 

00:12:55
JOHN CAPUTO But not for long. 

00:12:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. But don't you sense that the smile is some kind of a defensive... 

00:13:00
JOHN CAPUTO Absolutely. 

00:13:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. ...gesture? 

00:13:00
JOHN CAPUTO Yes. 

00:13:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. And, of course, you would see more of the problem the moment a person addresses it and let's you look at his body, let's me look at it, anyway, and I've got to look at it if I'm gonna help him really get to know himself, because to know yourself is to feel yourself right down from the top of your head to your feet. So, why don't we go right into that? Why don't you take off your clothes. 

00:13:20
JOHN CAPUTO Sure. 

00:13:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. He's prepared for this, so. 

00:13:30
[sil.] 

00:13:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Now once he does undress a bit, I will explain what I see in his body and what, uh, interpretation I make of it. 

00:13:50
[sil.] 

00:13:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Now, I don't know how easy it is for you to see him. Come into the light here, just a little like that. Alright. Now, there is a compactness and heaviness to his body and you can see it from the side a little bit, a lot of heaviness through this part of the body all the way through here. It's all heavy through here. Uh, this is also heavy, short neck, see? The legs are sort of thick a bit and, uh, there are other little indications. He has the bunions that develop right by the big toe and this is a common thing but a sign, also, of a disturbance in the flow of feeling through, through the body. Now the, as John stands there on a body level, you watch him breathe, he's breathing better now than when I first met him, but it's still just shallow breathing. And you don't see much happening in the body itself. 

00:15:05
[sil.] 

00:15:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. And my basic sense of him is that he has held himself tight and cut off feeling. That doesn't mean he can't occasionally feel. He fell in love and that was a beautiful feeling, but then that was new to him. He didn't know how to deal with it, not consciously in his mind, but actually in behavior and so the relationship fell apart and as that opportunity to come out with strong feelings, especially love, vanished and he almost, he got depressed and suicidal. Now, you're not gonna change John. When I say change him, I'm not gonna change him but he won't change unless that body becomes more alive. There's no way you can make yourself alive out of your head. There's no way you can create any feeling from your head, you see? And that can only be done as you change the dynamics of the body in the sense of put more energy into it and the body comes alive, feelings will come out, more about his childhood emerges to what he's afraid of, etc. And then, the changes will increase in a positive way progressively, spontaneously. Alright, to get his body alive he's got to have more energy and for that he needs to breathe, breathe more deeply than he generally does. Now, John speaks very well. The big problem we have with him, I say we as friends, is that he's always talking and his talking is a way of not breathing. So, what we would do right now is to use the bioenergetic stool and get himm to breathe and I, you put it right here, put yourself right here. Let's see how this is, and we reach back and now when you're over the stool, as I demonstrated at the, uh, workshop on Wednesday, you're forced to breathe. Go up a little higher, John. Up, up, go up. Go up on it. Good. That's it. Now, hold on there. 

00:17:00
[sil.] 

00:17:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. And if you lie over this, you breathe and we will watch the movement of the body as to what's going on on the level of breathing. Now, don't forget he's been therapeutic with me for about ni-, a year almost, huh? 

00:17:15
JOHN CAPUTO Ten months. 

00:17:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Ten months. That would be about 30 sessions, maybe. About 20 only, see? Good. 

00:17:25
[sil.] 

00:17:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. He's breathing better of course, than when he came in and things have happened to him in the course of this eight or ten-month period, but we need to do more work. And now...go ahead. 

00:17:45
[sil.] 

00:17:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. To increase the breathing and therefore put more energy in, we use the voice, so I would ask John to make a sound and sustain it as long as he can. The sound reveals, the quality of the sound reveals the internal feelings, the ones that exist in your heart, going down into your guts. So, try a sound, John. Let's see what it sounds like. 

00:18:15
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh... 

00:18:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Now, breathe. See, now with the sound the breathing gets, uh, deeper. Hold on. Hold on. Do the sound again. Don't force it, but continue it longer. 

00:18:35
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh... 

00:18:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Okay. Continue. Continue. Good. Now breathe. 

00:18:45
[sil.] 

00:18:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. That's it. See, now something is beginning to happen spontaneously. Any spontaneous feeling in the body i-, is an emotional thing. Just give in to it. You do nothing. Just let it happen. C-, can you make the sound again while it's going on? Go ahead. 

00:19:10
[sil.] 

00:19:15
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh... 

00:19:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Keep it going longer, John. Very good. Go on. Now breathe. 

00:19:25
[sil.] 

00:19:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Can you do it one more time? Keep it going just a little longer. 

00:19:40
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh... 

00:19:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Keep it going. 

00:19:50
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh... 

00:19:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Keep it going, John. Keep it going. Breathe. Now, if you li-, you may not hear it so well as I can tell, but that sound has a note of crying in it and remember he told you about his despair. There's tremendous sadness in this man and he knows that as well as I do and he knew it even when he came in. The question is to how to let that sadness come out and be released so his body can be free. You're aware of that sadness aren't you, John? 

00:20:25
JOHN CAPUTO Yes. 

00:20:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. But it's very hard for John to cry. Crying is the only way to release the sadness and open up the deeper feelings. And what, if you listen to the sounds..."Ahh," it's a little moaning and whining and this is what he did as a child when he was unhappy. He couldn't really cry he just moaned, little sounds like that. He had to block it off because his mother couldn't stand it and he-, there were real problems with his, in his relationship with his mother. Now, I'm interpretting for you. He knows this already, see, so, uh...Can you go once more with the sound? 

00:21:10
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh... 

00:21:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Go on, go on. 

00:21:15
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh... 

00:21:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Push your teeth out a bit, John. Push your teeth out. Push your teeth out. Go on. 

00:21:20
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh... 

00:21:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Keep pushing your teeth out. 

00:21:25
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh... 

00:21:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. That's it. Push your teeth out as much as you can. 

00:21:30
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh... 

00:21:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. That's it. Keep pushing your teeth out as much as you can. 

00:21:40
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh... 

00:21:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Push your teeth out again 'cause you're choking off. 

00:21:45
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh... 

00:21:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Okay. That's it. Softly. Just soft. Bring your feet a little closer together. I'll just guide them into the feeling. Bring your feet a little more together. Yeah, that's it. So that when he let's go, you can almost sense not only the crying but an underlying anger or rage there, you see? 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:22:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. You want to come up a moment? What're you feeling? 

00:22:25
[sil.] 

00:22:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Alright. Bend forward. See, we reverse the position. That's it. Do you see this hump here? This is right opposite his heart and it's a break. The tension here represents a break in the flow of the excitation and it represents the fact that under this tension he's holding a broken heart. Good. Now his body is becoming alive. It's vibrating, and vibration is the quality of an alive body. Dead bodies don't vibrate. Dead men don't vibrate. 

00:23:15
[sil.] 

00:23:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. You can hear the moaning sound. That's good. 

00:23:35
[sil.] 

00:23:40
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh... 

00:23:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. That's it. That's it. Let it break. Go ahead. That's it. Let go. Let go. We're just asking you to let go, to give in to your own body. 

00:24:10
JOHN CAPUTO Uhh... 

00:24:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Now, you, you hear the sound that's coming out. That's a very inadequate sound, I mean inadequate not in the sense of that he has to perform anything but inadequate for a person to be able to make. He should make, be able to make a stronger sound, release stronger feelings, which is hard for John. Come on a minute, John. That's good. Take just a moment for yourself. Turn around and face people. no plan your knees a little. Just loosen up. That's it. That's good now. His face has changed expression and this is important. We watch always the expression on the face. Can you say what you feeling? 

00:24:55
JOHN CAPUTO Frightened. 

00:24:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Yeah. Bend your knees a little. 

00:24:55
JOHN CAPUTO I feel I'm about four years old. 

00:25:00
[sil.] 

00:25:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Shaking? 

00:25:00
JOHN CAPUTO Yeah. 

00:25:05
[sil.] 

00:25:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. is there anything you sense you would like to do? 

00:25:25
JOHN CAPUTO Uh, go back on the stool. 

00:25:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. You would like to do that? Go ahead. By all means. Now, you do this, you go over the stool at home, to, don't you? 

00:25:35
JOHN CAPUTO Yeah. 

00:25:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. He has a stool at home because he knows he has to open up and breathe and it does help him. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. now, the nice thing about John is that though he is very frightened and his whole body is scared in a tight way, so you can see that, he has the courage to want to go into that and open, get through it. But I think he knows very well but at 52 either he works through his problems or the rest of his life is lost. Is that true, John? Wouldn't you say? I mean we talked about this so I can say that you. 

00:26:15
JOHN CAPUTO Oh. 

00:26:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. go on. Go on with sound again. Your voice... 

00:26:20
JOHN CAPUTO Ahhh... 

00:26:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Ahhh! Open it up! 

00:26:30
JOHN CAPUTO Ahhh... 

00:26:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Now push your teeth out, because... And breathe. 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:26:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. That's it. Go on. 

00:26:50
JOHN CAPUTO Ahhh... 

00:26:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Push teeth out again. 

00:26:55
JOHN CAPUTO Ahhh... 

00:27:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Okay, push her teeth out. Now breathe. Breathe. Now, if you're close to him what you would pick up is that there's the beginning of a feeling of anger. 

00:27:15
JOHN CAPUTO Ahhh... 

00:27:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Push her teeth out. Do you sense that at all, John. 

00:27:20
JOHN CAPUTO Yes! Yes. Ahh... 

00:27:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Alright, come on up and bend forward again. We just keep working back and forth on it. The more a person breathes this, the more energy he has. The more his body will vibrate and shake itself loose. That's the healing process. It shakes loose of the tension and it becomes free. And you can see the shaking now has extended through more of the body and it, the sadness is still very deep and the moaning continues and there is a sense of helplessness in John. 

00:28:00
[sil.] 

00:28:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Now, when we begin to open a person or even before and during it, we have to understand what happened to him in his childhood to force that individual to close up, to clam up, uh, to get heavy as a protection against the assaults of his environment. 

00:28:45
[sil.] 

00:28:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Now, come on up again and, uh, come on your, on the mats, why don't you... You want to rest a minute? Go ahead. 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. You can say your words about what you sense is going on. 

00:29:15
JOHN CAPUTO Just the sense of me is that, uh, unlike a very small child. Um, I'm not sure, um, where I am, I mean, I have like a conscious idea but physically I feel like a real small boy, uh, terribly frightened. Um, I feel somewhat angry and somewhat sad. I'm afraid they'll start convulsing or getting into some uncontrollable trembling of some sort. 

00:29:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. did you have any such sensations of, you know, you could convulse as a child when you are this way before? Did you ever have any convulsions? 

00:30:00
JOHN CAPUTO No. No, I was asthmatic, um, till I was about 17 and then, um, I met the first woman in my life and, um, no more asthma. Um, but no, I have almost no recollections of childhood. On-, only one, in fact, that's the one I revealed to you, um, about a week ago Dr. Lowen, about when I was about three or four someone give us a puppy and, um, but my mother didn't want it but what she told me was that I would kill it because I was squeezing it too hard or something and, uh, she took it away. Um, but I thought about that, uh, for the longest time and, um, I had been told this by so, so many different people that the contact with my hands is, is not alive, there is a, there is a deadness in there that, uh, the energy's not going through there. So, um, that's about the only childhood memory before the age of about eight that I have. 

00:31:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. And how, wh-, what was your experience in school because I know you had problems as a little kid. 

00:31:15
JOHN CAPUTO well, I was so badly asthmatic I only went... About one day a week I spent in the clinic, which was Israel Zion Clinic in Maimonides Hospital in Brooklyn. They were the only one dealing with, with asthmatics. So, I only went to school really four days and I guess from the time I was in school whatever, whoever my classmates were thought there was something wrong with me since one day a week I had to spend the entire day in this clinic and I guess that was for about six or seven years. Um, so I always felt somewhat alienated from the other children, that there was, except I was different and the things that I felt and thought weren't what other people felt and thought because, um, you know, my interaction with them was always strained and I was always pretty much fighting. I was terribly afraid of disappointment. Every time I made a friend for I thought I'd made a friend I was afraid that they might find out who I really was and then they wouldn't bother with me. That was pretty much, um, my experiences as a child in school. 

00:32:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Sure. Uh, don't you sense a terrible se-, feeling of loneliness at times? 

00:32:25
JOHN CAPUTO Oh, terribly, terribly so. Terribly so. For me, the loneliness really is the word alienation. It's like those Edward Hopper paintings. When, when I saw those paintings, um, that's exactly what I felt. That's what I feel now. I feel, for most of the day I feel alienated. Um, I just, that somehow I am not part of what everybody else's part of. 

00:32:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Yeah. 

00:32:50
JOHN CAPUTO Whatever that may be. But for me, it had always been a feeling, not an intellectual idea. I just, I just felt that I could speak well and I could be funny but physical closeness, or physic-, I was always aware of not being too physically close or thinking about being close. I remember always wanting to know when I was a child where my mother was in the room. Just, um, um, just always on guard that, um, I'm not really sure why because she didn't get me or anything but her energy, as the way I would interpret it now was such that's, um, she frightened me. As if, you know, something bad would happen, um, so I guess that, that relationship carried over to, um... When I have to be quiet with someone, really, really quiet and did not talk a lot is very difficult for me. I'm really frightened. I think if I keep talking they won't be able to figure me out or find out who I am. Um, so that's kind of why I spend most of my time living in my head. 

00:34:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. What about your father? 

00:34:05
JOHN CAPUTO My father was, um, a very insanely jealous person. Just terribly frightened, um... 

00:34:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. What did he do, John? 

00:34:10
JOHN CAPUTO Excuse me? 

00:34:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. What work did he do? 

00:34:15
JOHN CAPUTO Uh, he was a machinist, uh, then he worked for Rockefeller Center doing something else. He was a terribly insecure man and terribly, terribly frightened. Um, he was really crazy, really. He would see, see things that my mother was doing that, um, were, uh, no one else could see. I mean, he, he, she could make him crazy by just some kind of gesture she would make for the way she was standing in the room if she was paying more attention to someone else rather than to him. But I mean, even in later years he did, he did it on and on until he passed away, even when he died he was, he was that insane. he always accused my mother of favoring her children over him in every way imaginable. Um, my mother was a very cold person physically to touch. Um, if she was sitting down somewhere and I had to pass the area where she was sitting, if there was a chance I might brush against her knee she would move. She would get up and move. Uh, I remember that specifically as a child. Um, so I guess, somewhat that's probably why I was always aware of, sort of where she was in the room. She was always moving, moving around, uh, quickly. Um... 

00:35:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Don't you, from what you told me, don't you sense that she was at you also all the time? 

00:35:40
JOHN CAPUTO Yes. Yes, basically with, not with touching me, though. Basically with her eyes or with her incessant chatter. 

00:35:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Yeah. 

00:35:45
JOHN CAPUTO On and on and on and on and on. I think somehow that's, I kind of repeated that that day. 

00:35:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. You did. 

00:35:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Yes. 

00:35:55
JOHN CAPUTO I said, somewhat. Um, her eyes were always flashing and jumping and, um, they were never calm or peaceful. She's a very frightened person, um, even, even till today. My mother is 86 and, uh, if the doorbell rings you can, her physical body jumps. There's, um, there's some physical movement. 

00:36:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Yeah? 

00:36:15
JOHN CAPUTO Um... 

00:36:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Now, we're gonna go into the kicking a bit. 

00:36:20
JOHN CAPUTO Okay. 

00:36:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. But let me ask you another question. 

00:36:20
JOHN CAPUTO Sure. 

00:36:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Do you have any awareness of what you are afraid of, what would happen if you lost control? 'Cause you are... 

00:36:30
JOHN CAPUTO sure. The, the... Well, I go between the two fears of, um, going, going insane, um, where they would come and take me away and, uh, or they would, they would anesthetize me or they would, you know, give me some injections or something and then I have, um, fear that I will, that I will literally disappear, that I will have, I won't be seen. I won't be heard and I just won't be there. I just... 

00:36:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. You fade out almost. 

00:36:55
JOHN CAPUTO I will fade out, go catatonic, catatonic state, uh, a state of not, not being, not being there at all. 

00:37:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Right. That's right. 

00:37:05
JOHN CAPUTO Um... 

00:37:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. I sensed that in you. 

00:37:05
JOHN CAPUTO Yeah. The fear of going insane is probably the most prevalent one in me, you know, now that the other fear, the other fear is, is there, too. 

00:37:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Which? 

00:37:15
JOHN CAPUTO is there to, the fear of, um... 

00:37:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Of fading out? 

00:37:20
JOHN CAPUTO Of fading out, of not having, of not being there. 

00:37:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Let me take this. 

00:37:20
JOHN CAPUTO Oh, okay. 

00:37:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Come on your back, John. Here. Because there is no way we're gonna get through these problems just by talking, John is a good talker. In fact, he's too good talker. this is a basic exercise kicking and, uh, I use it with all patients. I use it with myself, too. I use it both as an exercise, just kicking instead of running. Some people run, I like to kick. That means I complain a lot about things they don't go right. But people are, are submissive and run. Now, we can do the kicking just as an exercise which helps you to breathe or we can do it as an expressive exercise which involves using your voice. For John, it's so important he can use his voice because his voice is nonresonant, not vibrant enough, you know, and he's afraid to really bring it out because if you bring your voice out you better presence. Your voice indicates your presence. Start to kick. Go ahead. Kicking. Yeah. Hold on if you want here to help you a little. just kept. Now, in in view of his relation to his mother, and I have this with all patients go with the words, "Leave me alone!" And see if you can do it like I did it. 

00:38:35
JOHN CAPUTO Leave me alone! Leave me alone! 

00:38:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Now, bring it up! Bring it up! 

00:38:50
JOHN CAPUTO Leave me alone! 

00:38:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Okay. Hold up a bit. Hold up. Bend your knees up a bit. Now, this is where I like to focus in the analytic aspect of the work. Did you sense that that, the way you set it was impotent? I sensed it and I think most of you could sense that. He does and this impotence is the biggest problem in your personality. I mean, it's tied up to your withdrawal, your fear, etc., see, on a physical level person in the the world. Now see if you can do it differently. Practice with. Listen, you're gonna kick and if they leave me alone but raise the pitch. Leave me alone! That's hard for everybody to do. And then if you're going to do it three times, breathe between each time, right? up her voice and keep the kicking going. Now, try. And And then, "Leave me alone!" 

00:39:50
JOHN CAPUTO Leave me alone! 

00:39:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Breathe now, breathe. 

00:39:55
JOHN CAPUTO Leave me alone! 

00:40:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Breathe three times. You're doing it. Breathe. Now, let's do it louder. Go on. Get it out. 

00:40:10
JOHN CAPUTO Leave me alone! 

00:40:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. That's it. That's it. Go on. 

00:40:15
[sil.] 

00:40:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. What feeling do you have right now? Now, I would pick up the feeling from his bodily expression, his voice. I know what's going on with him. What do you say? 

00:40:55
JOHN CAPUTO Angry. 

00:40:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Angry? It sounded a little bit more like hopeless. Oh, oh. And helpless. See, this is how a mind picks up a little aspect of our expression and focuses on that to deny the other aspect, you see? The, uh, sense of helplessness and hopelessness is much stronger than your anger. Anybody could tell that. Now, let me explain a little about the use of the voice because any time you're working with people, either physically or even talking, the voice is very critical because it is the voice of the person, in the person. It's very difficult for people to make the high-pitched sound. Women make it easier than men. Oooh! And the reason they can't make that sound is that it verges on the screame. children can scream and maniacs can scream but sensible, neurotic people can't scream. They don't even want to. Go on. Kick away again. Say the...take three breaths between each one. Try to raise the pitch, because then it opens up more feeling. He's got a lot to scream about, if I could get him to scream and make some real progress. 

00:42:10
JOHN CAPUTO Leave me alone! 

00:42:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Leave me alone! Come on! Pet it up there! Keep it going now, breathe. Breathe. ood. And now I can hear his breathing is getting a little deeper. Now, again with the sound, but stronger. Put the... 

00:42:30
JOHN CAPUTO Leave me alone! 

00:42:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Come on! Come on! Kick! Now breathe. Now, still stronger, give it every thing you've got. Come on, kick! 

00:42:40
JOHN CAPUTO Leave me alone! 

00:42:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. That's right. Okay. You can stop. 

00:42:50
[sil.] 

00:43:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. What's the feeling of that, "Uh?" 

00:43:05
JOHN CAPUTO Tired. 

00:43:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Say it. Keep saying it. 

00:43:05
JOHN CAPUTO Tired. 

00:43:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Put your knees... Put your head way back. Put your head way back. That is to open up a bit the throat. Keep saying it. 

00:43:15
JOHN CAPUTO I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. 

00:43:35
[sil.] 

00:43:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Now, the tiredness stems directly from the severe tension in his body, which is like carrying 250 pounds of pressure of equivalent of that and he goes around with 250 pounds of pressure all the time. He is really very tired. We all are pretty tired in this bad culture, but he's, uh, because we are under stress and we hold up and we carry the stress and get tired and we keep going on. And like John, we're all afraid to break down. 

00:44:20
[sil.] 

00:44:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Can you do the kicking exercise one more, and use either the word 'why' or 'no' or whatever word you want to use. I always say to patients if you can break my bed when you kick, you have a free session. So, go ahead and let yourself go as much as you can, John. Go ahead. Raise them up high. Kick away. Which word? 

00:44:50
JOHN CAPUTO No! 

00:44:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Breathe. Louder and sustain it longer. 

00:44:55
JOHN CAPUTO No! 

00:44:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Keep it going! Keep it... That's better. Sure. Now breathe. Breathe. Breathe. 

00:45:05
JOHN CAPUTO No! 

00:45:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. That's good. Now scream it. 

00:45:15
JOHN CAPUTO No! 

00:45:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Good for you. That's it. Now we're getting to the spontaneous expression of feeling where the curative process or the healing process occurs. You must have the preliminary work of mobilizing body before you can get to this, because you sit there and let them talk all the time or not breathe you'll never get to the feelings. Alright, how do you feel? 

00:45:45
JOHN CAPUTO Ahhh! 

00:45:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Here, hold on to that, John. Say how do you feel right now? What's your sense of it? 

00:45:55
JOHN CAPUTO Now, I'm closer to angry. 

00:45:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Yeah? 

00:46:00
JOHN CAPUTO Now, I wanna scream. 

00:46:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. What do you wanna do? 

00:46:00
JOHN CAPUTO I wanna scream. 

00:46:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Listen, try it this way. Oooh! Easy, high-pitched. 

00:46:10
JOHN CAPUTO Ahhh! 

00:46:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Oooh! 

00:46:10
JOHN CAPUTO Ahhh! 

00:46:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Easy, easy. Breathe. 

00:46:20
JOHN CAPUTO Ahhh... 

00:46:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. That's right. Now breathe, breathe! Just breathe. That's it. 

00:46:30
JOHN CAPUTO Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh! Ahhh! 

00:47:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Let me take it a bit. That's right. 

00:47:10
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh...Ahhh...Ahhh. 

00:47:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. How does your body feel to you? Here, you can hold. Here. 

00:47:20
JOHN CAPUTO It's more... It feels more alive. It's hard for me to stay still now. 

00:47:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Okay. You want to come off the bed and stand a bit? Would you like to do that or what? 

00:47:35
JOHN CAPUTO Uh, yeah. Yeah. 

00:47:35
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Let me, uh, do one more... We have ten minutes and we'll just do a little exercise and then I'll summarize it for you. Would somebody put another mattress on this for me? Anybody? There are a number of ways... Anger is an important emotion, not to be able to express your anger makes you a victim and helpless, because anger is how we protect ourselves from, uh, threats and from being hurt. Hold on to this, John, for me. Very few people can express anger in a healthy way. They can go into a rage or they can be uncoordinated in their expression of anger, hysterical, etc. 

00:48:20
JOHN CAPUTO Yes. 

00:48:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. But to really feel angry and to be able to focus it and contain it is hard. Um, I don't have all the... Would you like to do a little hitting here for me? 

00:48:30
JOHN CAPUTO Sure. 

00:48:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. For yourself, too, of course. Go ahead. I do mine... Go ahead. That's it. Bend your knees, John. Bend your knees. Relax. Now, say anything you want. 

00:48:45
JOHN CAPUTO No! No! No! 

00:48:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Go ahead. 

00:48:50
JOHN CAPUTO No! No! 

00:48:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Keep looking here. Always look there. That's it! Come on. 

00:48:55
JOHN CAPUTO No! No! 

00:49:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Go on! Stronger! Faster! 

00:49:00
JOHN CAPUTO No! No! No! No! No! No! 

00:49:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Scream it now. 

00:49:10
JOHN CAPUTO No! No! No! No! No! 

00:49:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. That's it. That's it. Stay there. Stay there. Just let go. I think that's the first time I've seen him break down like that. He's held that in all his life, 50 years. 

00:49:45
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh. Ahh. Ahh. 

00:49:50
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. A little bit of asthma comes through now. That's because he, he can't let the feelings out. Anger, crying... 

00:50:00
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh. Ahh. Ahh. 

00:50:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. His anger is blocked right in this tension. He's got his back up but he can't get the anger out, so he's in an unconscious holding state against his anger. Want to try one more thing quickly, John? I know you're a little out of breath and, uh, I'm about running out of time, so... 

00:50:20
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh. 

00:50:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Here, just change. Here, take this here. Instead of the hitting, which is good, are you okay? What are you feeling? 

00:50:35
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh! 

00:50:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. What do you feel? 

00:50:40
JOHN CAPUTO My own heart beating. Ahh! 

00:50:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Rest. Rest a minute. Oh, sure. Don't let me push you, now. Go ahead. Sit down. 

00:50:55
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh. 

00:51:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Here, you hold this a bit so you can... 

00:51:05
JOHN CAPUTO My head is spinning. 

00:51:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Yeah. 

00:51:10
JOHN CAPUTO Wow. Every time I do these exercises, I never know where it's gonna go. 

00:51:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. You did very well today, I think. I think you did the best I've seen you in terms of releasing. 

00:51:20
JOHN CAPUTO Oh. Ahhh. 

00:51:25
[sil.] 

00:51:40
JOHN CAPUTO When, when I'm in my body like that, I feel really young, really like a small child. 

00:51:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Get closer. 

00:51:50
JOHN CAPUTO Like a small child. It's very frightening. 

00:51:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. You're shaky now. 

00:52:00
JOHN CAPUTO Yeah. Ohh. A spinning sensation right here. Right through the top of my head. 

00:52:05
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Yeah? 

00:52:10
JOHN CAPUTO It's, it's not a dizziness. It's a, it's just a movement. 

00:52:15
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Do you have any tingling sensations? 

00:52:20
JOHN CAPUTO My fingertips. 

00:52:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Yeah? 

00:52:25
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh. Ahh. Ahh. Can I get a drink of water? 

00:52:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Sure. 

00:52:30
[sil.] 

00:52:40
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Now, uh, as he works with his body with an understanding and the amazing thing to me is how well John understands this problem and how helpless he is to be able to change through any conscious effort. But as he works with his body, he gets more alive, easier for him to use his, his voice to speak up. 

00:53:05
JOHN CAPUTO I can tell you, I've read all of Doctor Lowen's books and all of the monographs and, uh, I couldn't read or think myself through one session, much less any more than that. Somehow, the body gets a message that doesn't just walk through the intellect. In fact, it seems to work the other way around, at least it does for me. 

00:53:35
[sil.] 

00:53:40
JOHN CAPUTO And it's less confusing and a very much more direct message of how it feels and how it feels to be in the world, the physical feelings, a feeling your own heartbeat or even feeling, when I first started sessions with Dr. Lowen, uh, I couldn't locate my back at all. I mean, I knew it was there but I couldn't isolate one area or feel, get any sensation in there. Now I can get some, maybe about five or ten percent, but, um, before I got none, I mean none. It was like my body was, sort of, just attached to my head and, uh, had no input as to what was going on. 

00:54:30
[sil.] 

00:54:40
JOHN CAPUTO The resistance to this type of work, for me, has been because I can't use my head to get to it and you have to, I have to trust the processes of my own body without controlling it. So, I have to give up control, um, and it's not, it's not easy to do. 

00:55:00
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. It's very hard, in fact. 

00:55:00
JOHN CAPUTO It's very difficult to do it, um, especially when you've invested so much time and effort, a whole lifetime into living a certain way, to trusted to something else is extremely difficult, especially when the something else to me as such a young process. Ohh. 

00:55:20
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. That's it. Hold it but don't say anything for a moment. Just quiet. 

00:55:25
JOHN CAPUTO Alright. 

00:55:25
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. That's it. 

00:55:30
JOHN CAPUTO Ohh. I could moan, though. 

00:55:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Huh? 

00:55:30
JOHN CAPUTO I, I could moan. 

00:55:30
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. You could moan. You could moan for years, given what was done to you. And you smile. See, that's another defense. You know that, don't you? 

00:55:40
JOHN CAPUTO Yes. 

00:55:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Do you have any idea what the smile says? 

00:55:50
JOHN CAPUTO Yes. I don't want anyone to see my sadness. Ahh. 

00:55:55
[sil.] 

00:56:10
JOHN CAPUTO Ahh. 

00:56:10
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. let me say that, uh, any of the exercises that John, you saw John do, I've done them any times, much, with much more intensity of feelings and, uh, the more you can ex-, let your body, uh, simply express the full range of human feeling, you know, the sadness, every time... I get over this stool pretty regularly, and when I say pretty regularly it would be about at least five days a week, and generally I can get into a little crying. Dr. Hillman mentioned in his presentation about the despair that's in the world, that if you don't cry there's something wrong with you. There's so much unhappiness in each of us, so much on fulfillment and when you can cry it's like the rain coming down upon a parched earth, see? And people have trouble crying. John can't cry deeply enough. 

00:57:10

ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. You should be able to cry all the way down to the pit of your belly, a belly cry... Oh God. Let it go right through you, and shake you off and shake you loose, and if you could do that, you could also have a belly laugh which is one of joyfulness. But if you block the crying, you also block the joy. But were always afraid we're, not always, we're afraid to face the pain in us, the depth of sadness in us, the rage and anger in us. the telling me there's just one minute left. A one-hour presentation like this isn't enough to do justice to the whole bioenergetics concept, the work, the way we work. Let me end by saying that, um, you're always in touch with the patient verbally and physically, watching, talking, looking and trying to understand, and helping him to understand how his problem is related to his past and to his present behavior. But not counting on his mind to change it. I don't believe it has any power, but counting on his body to free itself. And one of the nicest things patients can do is just to say, "I wanna be free," because we are all prisoners of this culture and we're stuck within ourselves. Do you want to ask me anything, John?

JOHN CAPUTO Um,the question I had for you was about the contact with the ground, when you look at someone's needs or the waiter standing. 

00:58:45
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Yes, yes. 

00:58:50
JOHN CAPUTO And when the contact is, when you say the contact is not good or not full of integrity, what are you actually saying? 

00:58:55
ALEXANDER LOWEN, M.D. Well, look, when you look at someone, you look in their eyes, for example, you want to see a clarity, a beautiful clear expression and maybe even some light coming through the eyes, as if it could shine, see? Now, when you look at the feet you want them to be soft, pink, flat, relaxed, tinkling little bit, moving a little bit. You want the body to be alive. Bodies are not dead, you know? They're always living every minute and the life is expressed in its movements, soft movements. Color of the skin tells you something, the thickness of the muscles, etc. and now we have to stop. Let me, let me just say in ending that you've been very appreciative in going through with me this experience and I hope we have occasion to meet again. Thanks.
