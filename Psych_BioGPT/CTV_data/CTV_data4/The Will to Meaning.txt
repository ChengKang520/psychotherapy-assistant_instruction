The Will to Meaning 

00:00:45
VIKTOR FRANKL Father Watson, ladies and gentlemen, all the merits that have been attributed to me are nothing that I can subscribe to, but the only thing that I may pride myself of is not merit, but wishes. As a young man I had three wishes. First, to become a psychiatrist. Well, I became a psychiatrist. Second, to be a good psychiatrist. I hope I was not too bad a psychiatrist. And third, still to remain a human being. I'm still trying. That's all. Now, if a speaker comes from Vienna, you certainly expect him to speak with a heavy Viennese accent, as I do, and as you certainly have noticed. But if, at that, the speaker happens to be a psychiatrist, you certainly expect him to start with a quotation from Sigmund Freud. Now I have to disappoint you insofar as I'm going to conclude this presentation with a quotation from Sigmund Freud. Nevertheless, in order to quote someone, you have to have read his works. And so, of course, I did. I did so even, in, at an early age. But I have not only read his works, but also written my myself, uh, letters to Sigmund Freud. And I may assure you that each of these letters that I sent to him when I was 16, 17 years of age, was immediately answered by him. But I didn't only write to Sigmund Freud, I even had an opportunity to talk to him, in fact I met him, this was the case, in 1924, and when I introduced myself to him, my name is Viktor Frankl, he said, 'Viktor Frankl, [non-English narration], the street, number six, door, uh, house number six, door number 25, second district of, district of Vienna. Is that correct?' It was absolutely correct. From our year-long correspondence when I was a high school boy, he had remembered exactly my address. So good was his memory. Now I mentioned, and it had been mentioned by, uh, father Watson, that, uh, 1924, a paper I had included enclosed to a letter of mine a short manuscript without thinking of a possibility that this be published, but he immediately reacted by asking me the permission to forward it as a manuscript for an article in, uh, to be included and published in and published by the international journal of psychoanalysis, and so it was published actually. One year later, already, I, uh, was shifted to the society of Agrarian (ph) psychology, and published one year later in the International Journal of leader of psychology, also upon the invitation, in this case, uh by Alfred Adler, anyway, I may be called a fast bleeder, in this respect of publishing. Now, all the more, and this is the reason why he was offering this, uh, anecdotal items, uh, today, that to you, the reason was that I wanted to confront you with the fact that there were two different views on man. Implied in the respective teachings of Freudian psychoanalysis, on one hand, and on the other hand, of Agrarian psychology. The concepts of man, however, were not only different. Differing from one another, but even more, they were contradicting each other. And now, the question is, how should we approach this fact of contradicting views? Offered to our option? Now if you'll allow me to, uh, try to, uh, simplify matters. Certainly, also, to oversimplify them, I would like to show you how I see this, because not only the psychotherapy, or for that matter, the psychology, or for that matter, the anthropology, the theory of man that is. The concept of man. Is contradicting each other, but more than that, the book, wherever and whenever you open, as it will, the book of reality, you're confronted with contradicting views. With contradicting pictures of reality. Let me... 

00:07:40

00:07:45
VIKTOR FRANKL Let me symbolize this fact by drawing you a sketch. This here is the book of reality opened by you. On the left page, let me symbolize it by a square. Reality is depicted by way of a square. On the right page, however, it is symbolized, it be symbolized in this setting of this diagram as a circle. Now we know, since our years, that the age-old problem of square and circle has remained unsolved until today. And in fact, how shall we cope with these contradicting views on reality? Look here. What about turning this page into a perpendicular, or octagonal position? At the same time, you'll notice here we have the square and here we've still the circle. And at the same time, you'll notice that this square and this circle may well be regarded as the geometrical projections of one and the same thing, a solid that is namely a cylinder. These are the projections. Into the side-view on one hand, and for the ground plane on the other hand. In other words, what now happened is that we notice that the contradictions do no longer contradict the one-ness of that which has been, uh, projected into the lower dimensions, that is, the three-dimensional cylinder projected into the two-dimensional plane ground plan, and onto the two-dimensional side-view is not first losing one dimension, the spacial dimension, but even more, it has been, it, it, uh, winds up in contradictions. And now we may just transfer this or apply this too specifically-, the specifically human reality. And then we will find that what the individual scientific approaches. Or, more specifically, the individual psychotherapeutic approaches, say psychoanalysis over against individual psychology, see not, don't take, uh, hold, don't, uh, uh, uh, have a, uh, get into their awareness, the whole man, but just one aspect. Either one or the other aspect of the whole thing. In other words, man transcends, man is more than what the individual scientific approaches depict him as. And, the unity of humanity, the human-ness of man, is only gets lost in, within the projections. But not as such. But we must remain aware that man is more than just these pictures of reality as they are offered to us by the individual, uh, individual uh scientific approaches to the human-ness of man. Now, we have particularly remained aware of this fact. When we try to arrive at a psychotherapeutic approach to mental illness. Or to the ill-sent ailments of our time, which cannot be just dismissed as individual pathology, but are, as it were, form the mass neurosis, the mass neurotic syndrome of today. Or, to put it in another vein, uh, if for no other reason, we have to enter the next dimension. The human dimension. Over against the psychological and biological. This psychoanalytic or the Agrarian view. We have to follow man into the dimension of the specifically human phenomenon to get hold of his very human-ness. If for no other reason, I said before, we have to do so in order to, uh, get hold of those resources, which can be found because they are located only in the human dimension. The next higher dimension that is because we have to go from, we have to master these resources. These specifically human properties in order to include, to incorporate them into our therapeutic armentarium (ph). Now there are two such specifically human phenomena. Or, better to say, capacities. We are in bitter need of whenever we have to deal with mentally ill patients. Or, people, normal people, as I've to, elaborate on, normal people, not pathological people. Normal people who suffer from the loss and lack of meaning and purpose, as it is so, uh, widespread in our world today. The first such resources. The first of the specifically human capacities I'm referring to is what I would like to call man's capacity of self-detachment. This means man is capable, in contrast to other animals, to detach himself, not only from the outer world, one way or another, but even from himself. To distancing himself from himself. This capacity plays an important role. In that, uh, teaching that is, uh, called, uh, local therapy, inasmuch as it is underlying a local therapeutic technique called paradoxical intention. A technique that today is on a worldwide scale already applied by psychiatrists, psychologists, and so forth. Let me just, uh, invoke the fact that, uh, Dr. Mettlicot (ph), in New Zealand, is head of the Hetover (ph) Psychiatric University clinic, had published about 15 or 20 years ago already a paper on the application of this local therapeutic technique. Two cases of frobic (ph) conditions, anxiety neurosis, and compulsive obsessive conditions. In the meantime, uh, this technique has already been used, uh, at various universities around the world. Moscow University, uh, is using this technique, is teaching local therapy, as well as South American, Latin American Central American, and of course, clinics, universities in the United States. But, particularly in Canada, there was, about 15 years ago, the start of experiment-, experimental validation of paradoxical intention. As statistically its been called. I developed it late in the 20s, and published, started publishing on it already late in the 30s. And, in Montreal, at Macteal, uh, University, psychiatrists four psychiatrists had, uh, made experiments with, uh, people who applied this local therapeutic technique on themselves. They were severely disturbed. Eh, compulsive obsessive neurosis. And, uh, Solume (ph) and Olly Ikutcho, eh, experimentally, that, and why we do it. More recently, the follower of, uh, Wolpe, W O L P E, the actual founder of what has come to be called behavior psy-, behavior therapy, uh, the follow of Wolpe at the chair of the University in Philadelphia, and Michael Asher, has for about 12 years not ceased to, uh, come up with ever new and refined ways to make controlled experiments with, uh, the local therapeutic technique of paradoxical intention. To show he is from his background, a pure behaviorist, but to show that also within behavior therapy, paradoxical intention cannot only be applied, but should be applied in certain areas of neurotic illness, because it showed, it proved to be superior to other behavior, uh, modifying techniques in certain, uh, cases. Now, what I wanted to point out by this is that the human capacity to detach oneself from oneself, manifests itself, last but not least, in what is called A sense of humor, humor, too, is a specifically human property. No other animal is capable of laughing. And that way, the sense of humor can be mobilized and used within our therapeutic armoritarium (ph), only if we, as I put it before, have followed man and entered the human dimension. At a dimension which is superior than that is merely biological or psychological, or sociological dimension in which human phenomena may be projected. And if you have not entered, as the strictly behav-, strictly behaviourstically oriented psychiatries do, if they don't venture to enter the human dimension, they get lost of this property of these res-, or therapeutic resource, because they cannot, eh, on the grounds of experimentation with rats, or rabbits, they never are capable of, uh, using humor, because humor is human. And no other animal, in, not accessible to any other animal. So you see that all this that is, uh, so called dimensional entology, as I have called it, is down to earth applicable to actual medical psychiatric practice as well. Now more important, of course, is what we meet in this specifically human dimension. As perhaps the most specifically human thing that exists at all, at this is what the title of this, my presentation of today is saying, is pointing to, namely, the will to meaning. As the actor, as the basical human motivation. In other words, that man is basically concerned not as the previous schools we are teaching, with power, will to power. With pleasure, man is a pleasure-seeking animal. Or if we might call it, as well, a will to pleasure. But there are then, with the will to meaning, but if you look, uh, at a shorter distance, closely, to the question at hand. You will find what stands behind the will to pleasure. What stands behind the pleasure principle, as Sigmund Freud called it. Actually, Freud, on several occasions, said explicitly, that the seeking of pleasure is actually an attempt to get rid of tensions within the closed system that he called the psychic apparatus. Within this system, an individual is trying to get rid of all the tensions that may be aroused by drives and instincts. Or, by conflicts and complexes. Or, by the fighting, mutual fighting of id, ego, and super-ego. Or, by the, uh, uh, by the conflict between an individual the surrounding society and its precepts. And in order to get rid of all that, and it little seeks homeostasis as the biologists Hannon, at the verge of this century called it. Homeostasis, in equilibrium, that is. So, an individual is basically in the final analysis, seeking pleasure in order to get rid of tension. And now, what about the, uh, individual psychology-, uh, individual psychology view on that? Here also, we have to deal with a concept of man, according to which man is concerned with something interior. With something intrapsychic within his his psyche, as it were. Not, uh, eh, homeostasis. And the freedom of tensions. Eh, in equilibrium. But in the case of Agrarian psychology, man is seen as a being that is afflicted a priori with inferiority feelings. And, in order to compensate these feelings, to get rid of these feelings, and the tensions aroused by these feelings, man is striving to compensate, better to say, over-compensate this inferiority by a striving for superiority. Or, for that matter, by a will to power. But you may notice now, still, both views on man, the psychoanalytical one as well as the individual psychological one are dealing with man as a closed system. Are dealing with a human being as something, I'm emphasizing something not someone or somebody, something that, not who, but that is concerned with something intra-psychic. Within himself or herself. But actually man, the human reality, is signed, has the signature, has the property, deepest property, considerable of what I call self-transcendence. Being human, as I would like to define, means pointing to, or relating to, something other than itself. Something other, or someone other than oneself. Namely either, a meaning to fulfill. Out there in the world, not within himself, or our self. A meaning to fulfill, or on the other hand another human being lovingly to encounter. Now, you should not think that is this, what I've now elaborated on, and tried to convey to you, is something absolutely far cry from, far away from another movement in the field of psychology which is called humanistic psychology. Perhaps the actual founder of this movement, as you, uh, some amongst you might know, has been the great late Abraham Maslow. And, Maslow, in a comment, to a tape of mine, he had asked me for which he had asked me in order to be published in his, uh, journal of humanistic psychology, nearly 20 years ago, in a comment, he stipulated explicitly that what Viktor Frankl calls the will to meaning is the primary concern of man. He admitted. So, he was not, uh, he was perfectly, uh, susceptible to accepting this motivational theory I had developed. To be sure, all, in spite of all my great admiration for this great scholar, I do not, I ventured to declare that some of his motivation theories have not been totally acceptable to myself. I particularly would like to refer to his theory of a hierarchy of needs. You know, first the hunger has to be stilled, then uh, uh, love has to be offered, then a sexual relationships, and then uh, days, among others, for instance, security, the need for security. And only if the lower needs have been satisfied, man will be prone also to develop or even to satisfy if possible the so called higher needs, higher within the hierarchy, for instance, the need for meaning. But not theories, but practice. Have shown that things are different. I wonder if you can imagine any situation that, uh, uh, involves the more insecurity amounting to total insecurity, to extreme insecurity. Andy situation, uh, other than the situation of an, of a prison or in the concentration camp Auschwitz. And precisely there you could notice that the need for finding meaning, to this very extreme situation, to all the torments and sufferings there, is what was besieging, was plaguing, was burning under the fingernails of the prisoners of Auschwitz. Because, Tizen (ph), a man which studied the thousands of policemen from Denmark that him, had been brought to Auschwitz as prisoners, he studied what, uh, turned out, finally, after the war, as far as they could survive Auschwitz, and he found out that it was astonishing and greater surprise to him to see how few suicide attempts had been made there. In Auschwitz. In view of these extreme suffering situations. And this was because people did not despair, sp-, particularly, the patriarchs, the policemen of Denmark, were so strongly imbued with the will to survive, with the will then to continue their duties and so forth, uh so forth, that this will to survive, for the sake of a meaning in the future, rescued their lives. To some amount at least. I said they did not despair. Despair is what underlies a suicide attempt. But despair must never be identified with suffering. I'm used to tell my, uh, uh, students the to show them the following, as it wears, as it grasy, grasy equation. D equals S minus M. Despair is suffering without meaning. At the moment that you add a meaning to your suffering, at the moment you are capable of bestowing a meaning onto your suffering, you are spared despair. I would weary of telling my audiences, that, forgive me to be so repetitious, I've already nine years ago, had an opportunity to tell my audience at, uh, Electsha (ph) to give in, at, uh, Monasch University (ph). Namely, the story of a general practitioner. Elderly gentleman, who once, eh, visited me in my office in my hospital. Uh, many, uh, decades ago. Because he wasn't able to overcome the loss of his wife. Who he had loved above all else. Now, uh, he said, actually Dr. Frankl, I cannot tell you why I came to you because you can't help me, you can't revive my wife after all. And I myself could have had an opportunity to, uh, uh, write out a prescription of a tranquilizer, or whatever, but I just wanted to, to talk with you for a few minutes. Now, what should I have done, it was nothing left to me but to come up with a question. I asked him a question. I asked him, 'Doctor, what would have happened if not your wife, but rather you yourself had died first?' 'Oh,' he said, 'how this would have been terrible for her. How much she would have suffered.' And it was just left to me to continue by making the following remark 'Doctor, you see, this suffering, your wife has been spared. And after all, it's you who have spared you this suffering. To be sure. At the price of surviving and mourning her. At that moment, his suffering had been bestowed with a meaning. The meaning of a sacrifice that he owed to his wife. There was no longer despair. There was still suffering. The fate could not be changed. But it had been bestowed with a meaning. Now ladies and gentlemen, what I want to say to turn to the safe transcendent quality. Of the human reality. To repeat, to re-word what I said before. I would like to add: Man is basically concerned with a cause to serve. That is a cause greater than himself. Or, with another person to love. A person other than himself. But not primarily with anything within himself be it conflicts or complexes, drives or instincts to sa-, eh, to satisfy. Or inferiority feelings, to be overcome by superiority strivings. You notice the difference. One, first, one view is a I would say a more monaturalgistic view. Man is considered a monat. As Leidnitz (ph), philosopher, the great philosopher for three, four hundred years ago eh, eh, to-, uh, taught us. Monat. A psychological atom, as it were. Explicitly adding, with no windows, you see. No view to the world. Just incla-, inclosed, uh, into itself. Now, how come, that all this has so much, so, for such a long time been rejected by psychology? You see, uh, to a last attempt to show you what I have mind when speaking of safe transcendence. Would be the comparison, the analogy, the similar with our eyes. I venture to state that our eyes, their function, very function, are also safe transcendent. In a way. Namely, inasmuch, as the capacity of our eyes to carry out their function. Which is, visually, to perceive the outer world. This capacity to view to see the world is ironically contingent, dependent on the incapacity of the eye to perceive anything of itself. When does my eye notice, or perceive anything of itself? If I'm, am plagued by a, or afflicted by a cataract, I see some clouds, that's the cataract in my eye. If I'm afflicted with glaucoma, I see rainbow halos around the lights. This is the manifestation of the heightened pressure in a certain part of my eyeball. The normal eye doesn't notice anything of itself. And at the moment it does so, it proves to be im-, uh, impaired, its visual capacity is impaired. The eye is not normal. The eye is plagued by a, defected by something biological. It's the same with man. At the moment man is primarily concerned with himself, he has turned to be nearer. Normally, and originally, man is never concerned with anything with him-, himself or himself, but reaching out into the world, in the outer world, to find a meaning and going on to fulfill it, or else to find a partner to love him. This is the original concern of man. And never basically, primarily, anything, uh, any condition within himself. Now let's ask why do people so much care for themselves. In that, uh, sense, that the ba-, eh, become so, eh, occupied, with the goal, not of safe transcendence, but of self-actualization. While it is the truth that the more a man is concerned with meanings and other human beings, the more he forgets himself. And overlooks himself like the eye that has to overlook itself. The more he becomes human, and the more he really actualizes his or herself. While hunting for self-actualization is not the proper way to obtain it, it's rather counterproductive, and it was the great Maslow himself who once said that self-actualization may best be obtained not by hunting chasing, hunting for and chasing it, but on the contrary. By not caring for it, by devoting oneself, and I am quoting verbally, to selfless goals. To altruistic goals. In other words, devoting oneself to the world out there rather than to any inner accomplishments. What has caused man, men to be so concerned. Concerned with self-actualization? I know it, I pride myself to know it since the first lecture I gave in U, uh, in Australia. In, uh, da, '57 or so. At the psychological department of the University, I gave-, had to give a-, was invited a guest lecture, and then I was offered, as a souvenir, an Australian boomerang. And on that occasion, I learned something very ins-, essential. I learned something new to me. People always think in Europe the boomerang returns to him who has thrown it. That's not true. I have always told. Only that boomerang returns to the hunter that boomerang which, in the first place, had failed the aim. Has missed the aim. That failed the prey. Missed the prey. It's exactly with self-actualization. Only those people, those person-types, who, in the first place, had been disappointed and frustrated in their search for meaning out there in the world, return to themselves, reflect upon themselves, become so much eh, concerned with themselves, and with their selves, actualization. After this disappointment. After that frustration. They return like the boomerang. And isn't it true that if you define, as is usually being done, self-actualization as the actualization of one's own inner potentialities, that the problem is not solved. But the problem begins to play you. To confront you. You know who once spoke of himself as having the potential to become a criminal? Socrates. Socrates confessed that he found within himself the potentiality to become a criminal. Among other potentialities. So, he had to make a choice, he had an option. And he choose not to become a criminal, to b-, but rather to become the great philosopher. He chose what was meaningful to him. In other words: the meaning problem. Is of primary importance while the self-actualization enterprise of any indiscriminately of any potential is not dissolution, but constitutes an additional problem in its own right. How come I started to ask this question already, that psychology, for so long a time, has neglected. Has intrinsic, and essential safe-transcendent quality of the human reality. Let me also try to visualize this problem. You see, if we start with a modified form of the Heisenberg principle, you know, the great physicist and Nobel laureate Heisenberg stated to, re-worded, that, any observation implies automatically an alteration of that which is being observed. So we have here, in psychology, the...

VIKTOR FRANKL The observant eye of the psychologist. The psychological observer. He or she is observing a human subject. By observing it, he is changing it, turning it into something different. Namely, he's making the subject into an object. An object of observation. But alas, it is the most intrinsic property of a subject as such. Of a human person as such. That it is relating to objects of its own. This is what is called, in philosophy, since Brentano (ph), Husaro (ph), Shayla (ph), Heidecker (ph). Intentionality. Intentionality is actually the cognitive aspect of safe transcendence. So, so a subject is relating to other beings, and to meanings. In the world, meanings and beings, the world is replete of meanings and beings meanings to fulfill. Beings to encounter, other human beings to encounter and so forth. And these beings and meanings, after all, constitute the reasons to act to behave. If I, if the feelings that I should carry out, a meaningful job, an assignment, to try to make myself an astute vi-sa-vi an audience, such as you, then this is your reason to try hard, to give my best, the best, as the rest of the best that we still, uh, I still, is still, in, at my disposition. By disposition. Now, these constitute the reasons to act. But, at the moment that this world of reasons and beings has been shut out, because I have made the subject into an object, the object has no longer any reason, any relation to reasons or to other human beings, or to meanings, this is shut off. And, the subject made into an object is cut off the world. It becomes a monat, so to speak. You see, there are no longer reasons to act into the world, as it were. Into the world. But, instead of reasons, that have been shut out, what is done with the object, is no longer what a subject does. Being safe transcendently oriented throughout the world. Fulfilling being meanings and uh, uh, looking for B, other beings, but an object has causes, not reasons, but causes. Causes that drive him. Compel him. Compel him, the object, to behave one way or another. What is the difference between reasons and causes? It's very simple to be illustrated. If I cut onions, I start weeping. My tears, then have a cause. They are caused by a, stearic oils, within the onion. But if I mourn someone, whom I had loved, I have a reason to weep. See, my tears then have a reason. Because I've lost someone. But if I cut onions, my tears have a cause. It's an essential difference. Anyway, what is influencing an object, better to say, compelling it to behave one way or another, are causes that must be substituted for reasons. Which are no longer available. And the causes either, according to behavioristic view, are conditioning processes. Or, in the psychodynamic view, they are drives and instincts. In any event, it is no longer a reason to act into the world. But then either an individual is seen as, uh, reacting to stimuli, act reacting drives instincts, conflicts, and complexes. But no longer acting into the world. So we are, we are confronted with a triad (ph), of, uh, of, uh, motivations. Acting into the world. And to the world less being, either ab-reacting drives and instincts, or reacting to stimuli. Now, within the so-called human mystic psychological movement, there is one school that calls itself, uh, Gestalt Therapy. Which must not be confounded with Gestalt Psychology. It, the school of Frederick Pearls (ph), who started his career as a Freudian analyst and then built up his own way of looking at, uh, the human person. And, I once came across a sentence in the works of, uh, Frederick Pearls that reads, uh, something like: 'You think you are standing in front of a window, but actually you stand in front of a mirror. So, what we call the world, what we are looking at, seems to be the world, actually, we are looking at ourselves. We are just ex-, the world is just an expression of ourselves. So we will understand that humanistic psychology is not always really human psychology. And it fails to be a really human psychology precisely inasmuch as it misses the essential self-transcendence of human existence. So, some such psychological trends should be, uh, designated as self-centered psychologies. In contrast, to logo-therapy, for instance, which regards itself to be basically a meaning centered psychology. And it is so inasmuch as it sees in man a being in search of meaning. But precisely this human search for meaning is today more often than not, being frustrated. People are suffering on a worldwide scale, suffering from a feeling and abysmal feeling, one might say, of meaninglessness. Which is accompanied by a feeling of emptiness. By that condition, which I have come to term 'the existential vacuum'. The existential vacuum has two main aspects. First, boredom. And second, apathy. You may define boredom as a loss of interest in the world. And apathy you may define as the lack of any initiative to change something in the world. What has caused this state of affairs? I would say in an over-simplifying manner, that our industrialized society is out to fulfi-, to satisfy each and every human need. And, in the form of consumer society, it even tries to call, to create ever-new needs to satisfy. To be satisfied. While the most human need, the need for meaning, remains frustrated. People have, in the world, at least in the Western, uh, the so-called Western culture, have by and large, by and large, I am stressing, the means to live by. But they cannot see any meaning to live for. And this is what is haunting them ever more. It leads up to a mass neurotic triat (ph). A mass-neurotic syndrome. Which could be divided into three symptoms. Aggression, addiction, and depression. I would call this the mass neurotic syndrome. Addiction, aggression, and depression. Let me just, to point out, a small portion of empirical research which validates, has validated this view that I've developed. In the British journal of, uh, Social and Clinical Psychology, Black and Gregson (ph) have published, a couple of years ago, a study, an experimental study on New Zealand prisoners. And, they have applied the first of the ten, uh, tests that so far are existent in the field of logo therapy. Namely, James C. Krembos' Purpose in Life Test. And they confirm that in contrast of a, uh, a, uh, uh, the, height of purpose in life, 115 in the average population of New Zealand. The scores of the, uh, prisoners in New Zealand were not 115, but 86. And, uh, they arrived at this state at the conclusion, Black and Gregson, that criminality and meaning and purpose in life are inversely related. Bob was the first to apply logo therapeutic principles in his rehabilitation center in California, where he had the, juvenile delinquents. Juvenile delinquents treated by logo therapy. Could, within four months only heighten their purpose in life scores from 86 to 103, and he had ares-, Bob had aeriscitivism (ph), 08, not of 44-0 percent, as was at that time the average in the United States, not 40, but only 17 percent of recidivism. You see, it pays off to apply logo therapeutic principles in handling juvenile delinquents. Now, uh, so far, for shortly just sketchily for aggression. Now, about depression. The despair suffering, without meaning, results more often than not, in, unfortunately, in suicide attempts. Now, do not misinterpret what I have said and I'm going to say. Do not think that I'm so naive as to, uh, overrate, uh, the logo therapeutic principles. In, by no means do I think that each suicide is due to a feeling of meaninglessness. What I do think, what I am convinced is that if there had been a vision of a meaning to one's life, such an individual would not have committed suicide in spite of the suffering he had to undergo. So, in other words, meaninglessness is not always the cause of suffering. But meaning, having a meaning in life, and knowing, being aware of a meaning in life, may often, uh, prevent one from despair and even from suicide. And that is also the cause why, in such cases in which, even people I'm not aware of, any meaning, I perceive them the following way. I often tell my patients in such a setting, that I've served, as a young doctor, the largest Austrian, uh, hospital, uh, psychiatric hospital, the so-called 'Stanhope', and for four years, and throughout this period of time, I, uh, had to run the pavilion of, uh, uh, in which, a female patients, after having attempted suicide, were institutionalized. And I once reco-, I figured out, that it must have been about 12,000 such patients, who, as it were, went through my hands within those four years. And this, I'm telling, my other patients. And, say, tell them, that again and again it happened, that such individuals told me that they were happy that their suicide attempt was not successful, because weeks, months, often years afterwards, it turned out that their problem did find a solution, that their life still had the meaning. That their life still was worthwhile. But they could not kno-, know, in advance. And then I continue and ask my patients: 'Now, who can guarantee that in your case, this will not happen?' But of course, you have to preserve your life until that day dawns upon you. And that's why you have immediately the responsibility to preserve your life rather than to attempt committing suicide. Now, the question still is open. What can we do in order to help people find a meaning in their lives? Is that possible under any circumstances? You see, what we, in logo therapy, which is, after all, a psychiatric and medical approach, or for that matter, a psychological approach to, uh, psychological suffering. What we mean whenever we speak of meaning is not anything, uh, uh, up to heaven, but something perfectly down to earth. I would define meaning as something which, uh, harvests, midway between two, or, well-known concepts in psychology. The a-ha! experience along the lines of Carl Beuler's (ph) teachings, and the Gestalt, uh, Gestalt, uh, in the sense of Max Wertheimer's (ph), Kurt Youins (ph), uh, theory of Gestalt psychology, which has, scarcely anything to do with Gestalt therapy. Eh, in the sense of, uh, Fred Egbert's (ph). Now, you see, uh, meaning, a Gestalt implies that suddenly we become aware of some figure against a background. For instance, this is a cup, against the background of an audience. Then the cup means a Gestalt. And, in the perception of meaning, is I see the problem, it is not a figure against the background, but w-, meaning is suddenly becoming aware of a possibility against the background of reality. That if the possibility to do something about reality. To change the reality, for the better, hopefully for the better. Now, there are so far available 20 empirically strictly empirical studies, that could show that meaning is, in fact, available, can be found, by each and every person. Irrespective and independent, and regardless of gender, age, IQ, character structure, educational background, and environmental situation. And even irrespective of whether a person is religious or not. And if he or she is religious, independent from the, uh, denomination to which he or she may belong. I would not venture to say, to communicate this to you, unless, as it happens, these late, last findings, we are discovered, by two Catholic priests, in this framework of their respective dissertations at Canadian Universities. To myself it is small wonder that also irreligious persons can find a meaning in their lives simply because I, as I tried to evidence in a book of mine, The Unconscious God, uh, there are atheists and there are agnostics in whose unconscious you may well discover an unconscious, not to say repressed, religious feelings and longing. So, this is small wonder in my eyes. Anyway, each individual, in principle, can find and also fulfill a meaning in his or her life. How is this considerable. How shall we have we to interpret this? Simply by digging out what each human being has known all along by virtue of what I call the pre-reflective ontological self-understanding, or what you would call, or like if the, the salter calls the wisdom of the heart. Each, the simplest individual, the man in the street, or woman in the street, know, have known all along that meaning can be found on three main avenues as it were. First, by doing a deed, or creating a work. Second, by encountering something, or someone. Encountering the truth in the world by scientific research, for instance, encountering the beauty in the world, as in artists, or, by encountering a single individual human being in his or her very uniqueness, and this means by loving him or her. In other words, meaning can be found both in work and in love. But most importantly, it turns out finally, and it is unconsciously more what is unconsciously also, within, built in, as it were, in the ontological self-understanding, available within the wisdom of the heart of each and every person. That even where neither love nor work is available in a satisfactory manner, meaning can be found even in distress, in situations of extreme suffering, provided, to be sure, that suffering has been unavoidable. As the helpless victim of a hopeless situation, being confronted with a cha-, a, a fate that can no longer change, say with an inoperable cancer, with any sort of handicap, or with, uh, uh, with any disease or whatsoever, that is incurable. Up to the last moment, I've always the possibility to turn a personal tragedy into a triumph on the human level. Let me illustrate this by quoting from the book of a West German bishop. I once came across the following story in bishop George, uh, Moses, book. 'A few years after World War Two, a doctor examined a Jewish woman who wore a bracelet made of baby teeth that had been mounted in gold. A beautiful bracelet, the doctor remarked. Yes, the woman answered, you see doctor, this tooth here belonged to Miriam, this one to Esther, and this one to Samuel. And she mentioned the names of her daughters and sons according to age. Nine Children, she added. And all of them were taken to the gas chambers. Shocked, the doctor asked, How can you live with such a bracelet? And quietly, the Jewish woman replied, I'm now in charge of an orphanage in Israel. So now you may understand what I had in mind. When I said turning a tragedy into a personal triumph. Turning, you may say, as well, a predicament into a human achievement, an accomplishment. There is a letter I once received from Dean Stark. Of the University of Texas Medical Center in Houston. 'I have a 22 year old female client who, at age of 18, by a gunshot, was wounded and she can only eh, she is, uh, uh, uh, the paraplegia, quadriplegic, can only accomplish tasks by use of a mouth-stick. She feels the purpose of her life is quite clear.' The purpose of her life, imagine it, 'is quite clear, she watches the newspapers and television for stories of people in trouble. And writes to them, typing with the mouth-stick, to give them words of comfort and encouragement.' Imagine, she sees and fulfills a meaning in such a miserable life situation. If you cannot change your fate, you still can change your attitude, and thereby change yourself. By rising above your situation, and by growing as a human person. There I have a clipping from an, America-, a Texan newspaper. Therein is described someone who, at the age of 17, by a driving accident, also becr-, became quadriplegic. This young man wrote a letter to me, that's, uh, and he enclosed this clipping. Therein he says, 'Dr. Frankl, I've read, with much interest, man's search for meaning. If, after four readings, new insight and substance is gained each time, I'm currently enrolled in my first psychology course in college. He has a communication system at his home, he had it a couple of years ago, and could attend lectures and seminars and undergo examinations and so forth. 'I like people and want to help them. You see, Dr. Frankl, I view my life as a abundant with meaning and purpose.' He can only shrug with his shoulder and thereby make, uh, work, operate his communication system. And, or, type, uh, the, type writer with a mouth-stick. Also, he, with a mouth-stick, and his life, he finds, is abundant with meaning! My personal credit for life is, I broke my neck, but it did not break me. I met this guy, he was flown into the third work congress of logo therapy after I had invited him to read a paper there on the defiant power of the human spirit, as I've called this, once. He, being a witness of this human capacity. And then, he says, my handicap will certainly enhance my ability to help others, because without my suffering, the growth that I have achieved would have never been possible. Then he tells me the following. Just upon reading this article he enclosed to one of his letters, a woman with suicidal intentions decided to stop for least a moment, and to call me. She said, over the telephone, that she wanted to kill herself but she had read the article and wanted to know how I had gotten through the tough times. That she knew had confronted me. This is what, uh, Jerry Long, who had been described in this, uh, uh, story in the newspaper, uh, wrote to me. So we talked for almost two hours over the telephone, and in the end, not only was a death prevented, but a friendship was formed. And one of his latest letters, therein he says, I have been counseling already at several local hospitals. With excellent results. He boldly says. And in the next paragraph of the same letter, he modestly adds, accomplishments, however, are not to be rested upon, but built upon. That the story of that guy called Jerry Long, of Texas. You understand, I'm not preaching. I'm not teaching anything. I'm learning again and again from my own patients. And just want to share all this with you. So life may have a meaning, literally up to the last moment. Up to one's death. But even death does not cancel out the meaning of your life. On the contrary, death adds to-, meaning to your life. That death gives meaning to your life. Imagine what would happen if you were, if we were immortal and could delay everything, postpone everything, if not today, we'll make it tomorrow, if not tomorrow, next, next month, next year, next decade, and so forth. This would just put all meaning potentialities away from our lives. See, Hillel (ph) once said something that includes all that whatever I could offer you. Namely, there are unique potentialities inherent in each situation confronting us throughout our lives. And we, ourselves, each of ourselves, is a unique personality. And, the meeting of unique potentialities in the situation, and the unique personalities confronting them, means that each of us has to consider that his life is irrepeatable. Thanks to death, to our mortality. And, uh, eh, it, himself, or herself, is in an, cannot be replaced, irreplaceable. And, at that, he has to carry out to live out his her own self transcendence. Now, Hillel has put all this in a few simple clear terms and words without any such techni-, uh, technical language, ontological language, by saying, 'If I don't do it now, when shall I do it? And if I don't do it personally, who will do it?' But if I do it only for my own sake, what am I?' He could explain, no longer a human being. Because I don't any longer carry out the self transcendence of my own existence. So we spoke of irrepeateable situations. Whose meaning potentiality can be actualized. But once we've actualized such potentiality, once that we have, really fulfilled such a potentiality, then we have done so, not only once, but once and for all. Because we have safely deposited it, deposited it, we have safely delivered it in our past. Nobody, nothing can remove it from our past. It has been done so once and for all, as I put it before. We've rescued everything into the past. Past, nothing is irrevocably lost. But everything irrevocably lost, but everything is irrevocably stored and treasured, as it were. Usually, to be sure, we only we-, I were, stubble fields, uh, of the transitory-ness of our existence. But what we do not notice at the fie-, the full granaries wherein we have deposited the harvest of our lives. The deeds we have done. The loves we have loved. And last but not least, the sufferings we have borne with courage and with dignity. That is why we need not pity any old person, because he is no longer any possibilities in the future. We should envy old persons, because they have for long, long ago, actualized their potentialities and they fulfilled their meanings in the past, and rescued the fulfillment into the past. And when I pointed out before, excuse me, that there is an unconditional potential meaningfulness inherent in life. I have to parallel this by the unconditional value of each person on the ground of those values and meanings he has already fulfilled and actualized and rescued in the, into the past. This is the basis of the unconditional value of each and every person, and this value is what usually this unconditional value worth, usually is referred to by way of the concept of human dignity. The human dignity is indelible-, endures indelibly in each person up to its last moment, up to his or her last breath. And if you do not believe in this unconditional value and dignity of each single person, you owe it only to your personal inconsistency if you do not plead for and in favor of euthanasia strictly along the lines of Adolf Hitler. Because he thought that old age, or incurable disease, or mental deterioration, or whatever handicap one might be afflicted with, is a reason and a basis to be 'mercy-killed'. As the term was at that time. Ladies and gentlemen, I promised you to conclude with a quotation taken from Sigmund Freud. It's the following: Freud once said, ' Let one attempt to expose a number of the most diverse people uniformly to hunger. With the increase of the imperative urge of hunger, all individual differences will blur, and in their stead, will appear the uniform expression of the one instilled urge.' That much the utterance by Freud. Thanks to heaven, Freud personally was spared getting to know camps, such as Stalingrad, or Auschwitz, from the inside. His subjects, on which he, on whom he based his assumptions and theories, lay on, on comfortable couches designed in the plush style of the Victorian culture, and not in the filth of of Auschwitz, or Stalingrad. Because there, in Auschwitz, the individual differences to which Freud referred did not blur, not at all, but people became more different. People were unmasking themself. Both the swine and the saints. You see, ladies and gentlemen, uh, up to, uh a couple of years ago, I was always hesitating a bit when I mentioned this fact, and was referring to swine and to saints, we no longer need hesitate. After all, it was Father Colby, Maximillian Colby who was canonized a couple of years ago after he had offered his life, his sacrifice, instead of someone else. Another prisoner of Auschwitz, who had been sentenced to death and he was father Colby, starving to death, and father Colby, finally was killed by an injection of carbolic acid. Now, we needn't you may blame me for invoking just, uh, exception-, exemptions from from the exceptions from the rule, uh, because all these so called saints, we may as well speak of, just of decent people uh, are just a minority. In the camps, and in the rest of the world. Sure, you're right. But you know, what the last sentence of the main work of Baroque Dispinosa (ph), Benedict Dispenosa (ph), the great philosopher, what the last sentence of his main work, 'Ethics', reads? It reads, that, [non-English narration], which means that everything that is excellent and imminent is so rare to find simply because it is difficult to realize. So, I personally believe believe that decent people just form a minority of all populations around the world. But I ask you honestly, tell me, is this anything other than just a challenge to join this very minority? In other words, I concede, I admit, that the world is in a bad state, but, everything, believe me, will be will become still worse unless each of us tries hard to make the best, to give the best he can. Let's face the reality. Lets the face the fact that since Auschwitz, we know what man is capable of. And since Hiroshima, we know what is at stake. Thanks.
