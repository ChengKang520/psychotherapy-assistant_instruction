JENNIFER BAGGERLY Hello, my name is Doctor Jennifer Baggerly from the University of North Texas at Dallas. For over 15 years I've provided play therapy to children who've experience trauma and have seen the power of play therapy in helping children recover. There is hope for children who've experience trauma. Healing, peace and strength can occur with treatment from trained middle health professionals like you. This is an exciting time to be at children's middle health professional. Recent technological advances in neurophysiology have illuminated how children are impacted by trauma and how treatment can heal. Decades of research in children's Evidence-based Mental Health Treatment have resulted in the identification of core components of treating traumatized children. 

00:01:10
Trauma Informed Child Centered Play Therapy Objectives 1. Synthesize the neuro-physiological and psychological impact of trauma on children 2. Identify trauma-informed principles for working with children 3. Describe and demonstrate Trauma-Informed Child Centered Play Therapy for a) Establishing safety b) Facilitating a restorative retelling of the trauma narrative c) Promoting healthy connections with community members 

00:01:10
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Based on years of training, research and clinical experience, I have integrated this information into a new model called Trauma Informed Child Centered Play Therapy. The objectives for this video are to synthesize the neuro-physiological and psychological impact of trauma on children. Identify trauma-informed principles for working with children. To describe and demonstrate trauma-informed child centered play therapy for establishing safety, facilitating a restorative retelling of the trauma narrative, and promoting healthy connections with family and community. Please note that during my demonstrations the children are all paid actors not real clients. 

00:01:55
Definitions "Trauma Informed" • Trauma-informed treatment infuses trauma - Awareness - Knowledge - Skills • within a comprehensive treatment approach (Becker, Greenwald, & Mitchell, 2011) Child-Centered Play Therapy Definition • "a dynamic interpersonal relationship • between a child and a therapist trained in play procedures who • provides selected play materials and • facilitates the development of a safe relationship for the • child to fully express and explore self (feelings, thoughts, experiences, and behaviors) through the • child's natural medium of communication, play" (Landreth, 1991, p.14) Trauma • Trauma (Cohen, 2006) - Unusually severe stressor or event - Causes or capable of causing death, injury, or threat to physical integrity of self or others - Accompanied by intense feeling of horror, terror, or helplessness 

00:01:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Let's start with some definitions. What is trauma inform mean? Trauma informed treatment infuses trauma, awareness, knowledge and skills within a comprehensive treatment approach. Child Centered Play Therapy is defined by my doctoral mentor Garry Landreth, is a dynamic interpersonal relationship between a child and a therapist trained in play therapy procedures who provides play materials and facilitates the development of a safe relationship for the child to fully express and explore self, feelings, thoughts, experiences and behaviors, through the child's natural medium of communication, play. What is the definition of trauma? Trauma is defined by Judith Cohen and colleagues is unusually severe stressor or event that causes or is capable of causing death, injury, or threat to the physical integrity of self or others. And is accompanied by intense feelings of horror, terror or helplessness. 

00:03:10
Which is least likely to be considered a trauma? • Witnessing a mother be repeatedly punched by her boyfriend • Sexual abused by a stranger • Community violence with frequent sounds of gun shots • Witnessing the death of a pet • Quiet divorce of parents after a year of separation Child Traumatic Stress • Child Traumatic Stress (NCTSN), 2003 - Children exposed to one or more traumas - Develop reactions that persist and affect their daily lives 

00:03:10
JENNIFER BAGGERLY So here's your first quiz which of these is least likely to be considered a trauma according to the definition. Witnessing mother being repeatedly punched by her boyfriend, sexual abused by a stranger, community violence with frequent sounds of gun shots, witnessing the death of a pet or a quiet divorce of parents after a year of separation. It would be the quiet divorce because it is least likely to post a threat to physical integrity. Child traumatic stress occurs when a child is exposed to one or more traumas and develops reactions that persist and affect their daily lives. Usually from intrusive memories, hypervigilance, and or avoidance of trauma reminders. 

00:04:00
Staggering Stats Approximately 80% of the perpetrators of child maltreatment are the children's own parents. Rate of Adverse Childhood Experiences Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) study of 17,000 adults (Anda & Felitti & Anda, 1998) Category of childhood abuse Prevalence (%) • Psychological 11.1% • Physical 10.8% • Sexual 22.0% • Parent's Substance abuse 25.6% • Family Mental illness 18.8% • Mother treated violently 12.5% 2003 Survey of 2,200 Children (van der kolk et al. 2008) Child trauma Exposure Most childhood trauma is interpersonal in nature. 

00:04:05
JENNIFER BAGGERLY How many U.S. children experience trauma? Unfortunately, over 702,000 U.S. children experienced abused or neglect in 2010. Approximately 80% of the perpetrators of child maltreatment are the children's own parents. According to the Adverse Children's Experiences study of 17,000 adults, approximately one-fourth of all participants experienced one or more types of abused or household dysfunction. For example, 11% experienced psychological abuse, 10.8% experienced physical abuse, 22.0% experienced sexual abuse, 25.6% experienced their parent's substance abuse, 18.8% experienced family mental illness and 12.5% experienced their mother being treated violently. Look at these results, a van der kolk study of 2,200 children. Most childhood trauma is interpersonal in nature. This gives us our first clue to the nature of the treatment that is needed. Interpersonal nurturing relationship. 

00:05:25
Objective 1 Neurophysiology Limbic System Cortex Midbrain Brainstem Cerebellum 

00:05:30
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Now that we have our definitions established. Let's synthesize the neuro-physiological and psychological impact of trauma on children. We need to understand the functional divisions of the human brain from the bottom up, so that we can understand how to direct our interventions. The brainstem governs heart rate, respiration, sensory awareness, startle or fear response and attention. The cerebellum governs sleep cycles, appetite, motor regulation in the fight or flight response. The limbic system or the socio-brain regulates social behavior, affect modulation, pleasure, play and short-term memory. The cortex, neo-cortex governs thinking, reasoning, abstract concepts, planning, sequencing, decision making, impulse control and insight. One easy way to remember these divisions and to explain it to parents and children is through the hand model that Daniel Siegel describes. Hold up your hand , your arm and wrist is the spinal cord, the bottom of your hand represents the brainstem and cerebellum. Now fold over your thumb which represents the limbic system. Now fold down your fingers to represent the cortex. In children the brainstem, cerebellum and limbic system must be calm and regulated before learning and reasoning can take place in the cortex. When the lower brain becomes disregulated we flip our lids and are not able to be tuned in and cannot think clearly. At that point, any verbal reasoning or teaching that goes on will not be effective. The only way to calm down a child is to intervene in the lower parts of the brain. Now let's discuss what happens in the brains of babies and young children who have experienced chronic trauma. Each of these brain structures, the brainstem, cerebellum, limbic system and cortex are made up of neurons. A new born baby's brain contains over 100 billion neurons that are all impacted by experience. Synapses or connections between the neurons through which information flows from one neuron to another. The synapses organize the brain and form pathways. This synapses are pruned either strengthened, reinforce by similar experiences or eliminated. This is called the use it or lose it principle. 

00:08:15
Brain Development and Trauma • Infants relational transactions are indelibly imprinted into maturing brain structures (Schore, 2003) • Face to face interactions activate mirror neurons • Responsive primary attachment figure strengthen pathways toward secure attachments • Neglectful caregivers strengthen different pathways toward insecure attachments (Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000) Impact on Physiology (, 2007; Terr, 1990)• Rapid breathing • Hypervigilance • Muscle tension • Headaches & stomach aches Impact on Behavior (Cohen, Mannarino, & Deblinger, 2005, Newton, 2001; , 2007) • Fight or flight response • Aggression and oppositional behaviors • Withdrawn and passive behaviors • Over-dependence - clingy • Trauma-specific fears or avoidance • Self destructive behaviors • Sexualized behaviors • Post Traumatic Play 

00:08:20
JENNIFER BAGGERLY By adolescence half of the synapses are discarded. Infants relational transactions are indelibly imprinted into maturing brain structures. Face to face interactions activate mirror neurons. Responsive primary attachment figure strengthen the pathways toward secure attachment. Neglectful caregivers strengthen pathways toward insecure attachment. Doctor Bruce Perry has describe how states of anxiety can become traits of anxiety in chronically traumatized children. This trait of anxiety can be a longer to continuum of either arousal or dissociation. Arousal to the traumas often misdiagnosed as ADHD. Disassociation due to trauma look similar to depression. Trauma can cause children to experience responses or symptoms in five areas. We will look at these as they occur in the brain from the bottom up. First, trauma impacts physiology, rapid breathing, hypervigilance, muscle tension, headaches, stomach aches. Second, trauma impacts behavior, the fight or flight response, aggression and oppositional behaviors that may result in bullying, withdrawn and passive behaviors, over-dependence and clinginess, trauma specific fears or avoidance, self destructive behaviors, sexualized behaviors or post traumatic play or play reenactments that are repetitive, highly structured, self absorbed, enjoyless reenactments of trauma. 

00:10:10
Impact on Emotions (, 2006, Cohen, Mannarino, & Deblinger, 2005, Newton, 2001; , 2007, et al... 2007) • Fear • Ambivalence and confusion • Guilt or a sense of responsibility • Depressive Feelings • Rage and anger • Anxiety • Affective Dysregulation- moodiness • Attachment problems/lack of trust • Low self esteem Impact on Cognitions/Belief Systems (, 2007, Terr, 1990) • Visual images, intrusive thoughts • Difficulty concentrating, making decisions • Inattentiveness at school and play • Cognitive Distortions - "my fault", "aggression is O.K." Generalizations - everything will be terrible • Over-Focusing or fixation • Ego-Dystonic- make experience fit ideal • Safety, trust/dependence, morality distorted 

00:10:15
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Third, trauma impacts some motions, fear, ambivalence and confusion, guilt or a sense of responsibility, depression, rage and anger, anxiety, affect dysregulation or moodiness, attachment problems, lack of trust, low self esteem. Fourth, trauma impacts cognitions and belief systems. Recurrent, intrusive visualizations and thoughts. Difficulty concentrating, making decisions. Inattentiveness at school and play. Cognitive Distortions such as "it's my fault" or "aggression is okay." Over generalizations like everything will be terrible. Over-focusing or fixation, ego-dystonic making experiences fit and ideal, safety, trust, dependence, morality become distorted. 

00:11:15
Impact on Spirituality (Baggerly, 2006) • Doubts about God • View of God as abuser • Abandon spiritual rituals/routines • Meaninglessness Long Term Health Consequences • Twice as likely to be smokers • 12 times more likely to have attempted suicide • 7 times more likely to be alcoholic • 10 times more likely to have injected street drugs • 1.4 to 1.6 fold more likely for severe obesity Long Term Mental Health Consequences of Trauma (Millward, 2006) Children living foster care scored significantly higher for: • Conduct problems • Anxiety and depression • Hyperactivity • Peer relationship problems • Reactive Attachment Disorder 

00:11:15
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Fifth trauma impacts spirituality or sense of meaning. There may be doubts about God or viewing God as an abuser. Abandonment of spiritual rituals and routines. Meaninglessness. Trauma can also cause long-term health consequences. The Adverse Children Study of 17,000 adults by Felitti and Anda found that adults with humorous adverse advance compare to those without were twice as likely to be smokers, 12 times more likely to have attempted suicide, seven times more likely to be alcoholic, 10 times more likely to have injected street drugs, and 1.4 to 1.6 fold more likely to have severe obesity. We're looking at long term mental health consequences of children with severe trauma. Millward found 53% of the children in foster care fulfill criteria for mental health problems compared with 13% of the control group. The children living in foster care, scored significantly higher for conduct problems, anxiety and depression, hyperactivity, peer relationship problems and reactive attachment disorder. This long list of the deleterious effects of trauma on children can be overwhelming. So let's briefly look at the hopeful side. Children's resilience, their ability to bounce back from adversity can be promoted by protector factors. Children's qualities for protector factors includes intelligence, humor, good communication skills and having goals. Family qualities include at least one nurturing warm and caring person who consistently interacts in positive way with the child as well as family routines, and open communication. Support outside the family also includes caring teachers, spiritual support or church, and mental health treatment. This information on neurophysiology and the impact of trauma on children is important not only for you to understand but also for parents and children to understand. Let me demonstrate how to explain this to parents and children then it will be your turn to practice. Again all the children in this video are paid actors not real clients. 

00:13:50
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Well, Miss Doris and Levi thank you for coming in to this part of our play therapy session. I wanted to introduced you to my friend Tucker the turtle. He's kind of shy, would you like to say Hi to him Levi. 

00:14:05
LEVI Hi. 

00:14:05
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah, his kind of a shy turtle because he doesn't know people in, in so-- sometimes it's gonna hide inside here. But then he gets really brave when it comes out. But Tuckers here to help me explain to you what happens, uhm, in children's brain in their body after something scary like, ah, the accident you are in. And Levi do you remember, ah, being in the car accident with your Mom. 

00:14:30
LEVI Yeah. 

00:14:35
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah. And, and Mom you said you are after the car accident you were in the hospital for a week or so. 

00:14:40
MRS. DORIS Yes, yes almost died. 

00:14:40
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah. That was very, very scary. 

00:14:45
MANDI DORIS Yes. 

00:14:45
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Well let me tell you about your brain. Levi can you go like this. Put your hand up like that, all right. Do you know that this part of your brain right here, this is sort of like the back part of your brain, this is called the brainstem and, ah, that helps us breathe and it helps heart rate keep going. Can you put your hand on your-- in-- on your heart? Well that part helps us breathe and the heart rate and the sister the cerebellum and that help us to, uhm, to have activity. And sometimes what happens when something scary people go, "Oh," like that and they get scared and maybe they try and run away or they fight or something. And then, this right here-- this right here go like that with your thumb that's called the limbic system this is up on your head right there and that has to do with your, your, ah, emotions like when you feel happy or when you feel sad. And this part is like the cerebellum and this is what helps you think. And have you ever noticed like sometimes when you get like scared you kind of flip your lid where it's hard for you think, have you noticed that Mom sometimes when you gets upset or something - 

00:16:00
MANDI DORIS Yes. 

00:16:00
JENNIFER BAGGERLY - it's hard for you to think and you just kind a flip your lid. 

00:16:05
MANDI DORIS Yes. Yes. 

00:16:05
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yes. And so what happens when sometimes something scary, kids sometimes notice things that are different in their brain and their body. Uhm, have you noticed anything different Levi after your accident have you noticed anything different in your, in your body? Does anything been hurting you in your body? 

00:16:25
LEVI JOHANON Yeah. 

00:16:25
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Like what? 

00:16:25
LEVI JOHANON Like buzzer chewing all my ribs. 

00:16:30
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah. It's yeah. It's like something hurting your ribs and your, and your stomach is hurting. Yeah. Okay. And, and what else have you noticed Mrs. Doris, what else have you noticed? 

00:16:40
MANDI DORIS He's-- Levi has had a lot of nightmares. 

00:16:45
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. Yeah. That's part of that. 

00:16:45
MANDI DORIS And he's, he's been very quiet. 

00:16:45
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. Yes. This are, are things that happen to kids after something scary, many kids feel, ah, upset in their stomach. And many kids have nightmares and maybe trying to hide like little Tucker the turtle. But you know what you're gonna do here in play therapy? Were gonna give you time to play and you're gonna have 30 minutes of playing. And then together we're going to help teach you how to calm your body down, so that you can come out and play instead of hiding like little the turtle in there. Cuz when Tucker's hidden like that do you think he has much fun? 

00:17:25
LEVI JOHANON No. 

00:17:25
JENNIFER BAGGERLY No, he can't play with the toys and he can make friends. So we want to help you so you are brave and, ah, so you wouldn't had the upset stomach or upset, ah, thought-- upsetting thoughts. So Levi, Mrs. Doris what do you usually do to help try to calm your bodies down when something happens at home or school that you don't like? What is that something that you usually do? 

00:17:55
MANDI DORIS Well we spend some quality time together. We, ah, read books and we pray. And then we play X-box. 

00:18:05
JENNIFER BAGGERLY All right. So you, you, ah, do a lot of things, you play together, you pray, uhm, you spend quality time, it looks you like holding each other and that's a great way to calm yourselves down. And so, ah, Levi I wanna teach you something new. Can you put your hands behind your head like this. This help you take deep rest, this is called, ah, butterfly breathing. Yes, that helps calm you down. So if you do this before you go to bed or when you start to have upset stomach that might help calm down, and then watch this. I've learn this from some friend. You can cross your hands like this, this is called a butterfly hug and then you can calm yourself down like that. And then Mom, uhm, actually you holding him and just kind of rocking him. If you just rocking very slowly at, uhm, 60 beats a minute, that's like him hearing your heartbeat when he was inside you before you were born, Levi did you that? That you were inside your Mom and you were hearing her heartbeat and that, that can help you calm you down. So that's what sa-- these are some of the things we're going to do in our play therapy sessions after you have your 30 minutes of play and we're going to learn some things so that Mom can help you learn to calm down. At home and, ah, before you go to school and in the evening. All right. So thank you so much for coming in you wanna pet Tucker before you leave. All right. We're looking forward to spending time with you and helping you to get better. All right, thank you very much Levi, thank you Mrs. Doris. 

00:19:50
MANDI DORIS Thank you, Doctor Baggerly. 

00:19:50
Objective 2 Repair Trauma: Face to Face Interactions with Nurturing Caregivers "Healing takes place through the experience, not words, of nonjudgmental acceptance." -Badenoch 

00:19:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY As you learned most trauma is interpersonal in nature. The brain is wired to be relational. Thus, recovery from trauma is based on face to face interactions with nurturing caregivers and mental help professionals. This face to face interactions allow for affect synchronizing and affect regulation. This occurs through the activation of mirror neurons where children will mimic the facial expressions and affect of an adult. This relational connection becomes the rhythmic dance toward healing and calming the brainstem and cerebellum and regulating the limbic system. So that the cortex is ready to learn and govern lower parts of the brain. Badenoch says, healing takes place through the experience, not words, of nonjudgmental acceptance. That's the most important principle in treating children with trauma, thus facilitating consistent, nurturing, warm relationship with the child. 

00:21:05
Core Components of Children's Trauma Interventions (NCTSN, 2008) 1. Risk screening and triage 2. Systematic assessment, case conceptualization, & treatment planning 3. Psycho-education 4. Addressing children & families' traumatic stress reactions/experiences 5. Trauma narration and organization 6. Enhancing emotional regulation and anxiety management skills 7. Facilitating adaptive coping and maintaining adaptive routines 8. Parenting skills and behavior management 9. Promoting adaptive developmental progression 10. Addressing grief and loss 11. Promoting safety skills 12. Relapse prevention 13. Evaluation of treatment response and effectiveness 14. Engagement/addressing barrier to service-seeking 

00:21:10
JENNIFER BAGGERLY The children's traumatic stress network has identified 14 core components of children's trauma interventions. Look at these 14 components. As you look at this list, identify two of your current strengths and identify two areas where you need to improve.

Trauma Screening Child Stress Disorder Checklist (Saxe, 2001) Free!! Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (Ippen, et. al., 2002) Free!! 

00:21:40
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Now let's look at some trauma screening and assessment instruments for young children before we get in to treatment planning. A parent or caregiver base screening can be done with the child's stress disorder check list which is free. A direct screening of the child can be done with the traumatic event screening inventory which is also free. Here's a brief glimpse of administration with the child. 

00:22:05
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Katelyn, this is my friend, and guess what, her name is Katelyn the caterpillar. And look what she can do. She turns into a beautiful butterfly. Would you like to play with that? I'm gonna be asking you some things about what, what happens to kids sometimes, and, uhm, they were gonna talk about it and if you don't wanna talk about something you can just say I don't wanna talk about it or pass. But I like to know has someone ever tried to attack you or hurt you like, ah, hit you really bad or choke you? 

00:22:45
KATELYN BAGGERLY Abby hit me one time on my (inaudible ) he, he-- she knocks me over on the ground and I hurt my head, in my forehead. 

00:23:00
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Aha, and who was Abby? Is Abby a friend or... 

00:23:05
KATELYN BAGGERLY A dog. 

00:23:05
JENNIFER BAGGERLY A dog. So your, your dog, Abby, knock you over and hit you there on the, on the head. Aha, and how old were you when that happened? 

00:23:15
KATELYN BAGGERLY Six. 

00:23:15
JENNIFER BAGGERLY You were six years old. And then what happen after that? 

00:23:20
KATELYN BAGGERLY I don't know. 

00:23:25
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Did you feel really, really afraid and scared. 

00:23:25
KATELYN BAGGERLY Yes. And I cried. 

00:23:30
JENNIFER BAGGERLY And you cried, oh, wow, okay. Well, and has anybody in your family ever been fighting or trying to hurt each other really bad? 

00:23:40
KATELYN BAGGERLY No. 

00:23:45
JENNIFER BAGGERLY No. Okay. And have you ever been in a bad storm like a tornado or a hurricane? 

00:23:50
KATELYN BAGGERLY No, but I've dream about it. 

00:23:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh, you did have a scary dream about something like that. 

00:23:55
KATELYN BAGGERLY But it wasn't scary I was af-- I was not afraid but I was just like, like brave I was like the movie called Brave. 

00:24:05
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh, yes, so you were a brave girl that is good to know. All right. Well, thank you for helping me answer these questions. Now its gonna be time for us to play. 

00:24:20
Assessments • Detailed semi structured interview of parent • Child Stress Disorder Checklist (Saxe, 2001) - Free!! • Children's PTSD Inventory (Saigh, 2004) • UCLA PTSD Index for DSM-IV (Pynoos, et. al., 1998) • Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (Ippen, et. al., 2002) - Free!! • Trauma Symptom Checklist for Young Children (Briere, 2001) • Trauma Play Scale (Findling, 2006) • Child Behavior Checklist ( Achenbach, 1994) • Revised Manifest Anxiety Scale (Reynolds & Richmond, 1985) • Children's Depression Inventory (Kovacs, 1982) • Many more listed at NCTSN under Measures Review Database www.nctsn.org 

00:24:20
JENNIFER BAGGERLY For assessment, begin with the detailed semi structured interview, either informally or using the UCLA PTSD Index. Other common instruments are listed here. These assessments will help you identify concerns and evaluate the effectiveness of your intervention. 

00:24:40
Treatment Interventions 

00:24:45
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Well, there are many evidence-based trauma interventions for children. Many of them have limitations for young children. Some intervention are language-based requiring higher brain functioning than young children's cognitive development level of sensory motor or concrete operations. Developmental psychologist such as PJF stated that young children need developmentally appropriate interventions that are based in play. Other trauma interventions are parent-focused and may not work for unavailable or reluctant parents. One prominent and promising treatment modality that overcomes these language-base and parent-based limitations and is commonly used by child therapist to improve children's mental health, is child centered play therapy. Child Centered Play Therapy is based primarily on the child's natural language of play which is developmentally appropriate for young children and does not depend solely on higher cognitive development or cooperation of parents who may be reluctant or unwilling to participate in therapy. 

00:25:55
Child Centered Play Therapy Has been shown to improve the mental health of children who are: - Homeless (Baggerly, 2004) - Witnesses of domestic violence (Tyndall-Lind & Giordano, 2001) - Natural disasters (Shen, 2002) - Refugees (Schottelkorb, Doumas & Garcia, 2012) 

00:26:00
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Child Centered Play Therapy has been shown to improve the mental health of children who are homeless, witnesses of domestic violence, natural disasters and refugees. Yet historically Child Centered Play Therapy has not integrated in the NCTSN core components for treating traumatized children. Building on the success of Child Centered Play Therapy, I recommend Trauma-Informed Child Centered Play Therapy as a treatment for young children who've experience high levels of trauma such as abuse or neglect. Trauma-Informed Child Centered Play Therapy infuses trauma awareness, knowledge and skills into Child Centered Play Therapy by adding 15 minutes of lower brain neuro developmental activities. As well as evidence based trauma focus activities. Parent consultation is provided but parents are not required to participate in every session. Trauma-Informed Child Centered Play Therapy is theoretically consistent with Axline's eight basic principles. By focusing on the therapeutic relationship and allowing the child to lead the play for the first 30 minutes, then we add on 15 minutes of psycho-education for children and parents to meet their needs for knowledge and skills. 

00:27:25
Hermn's Tri-phasic Model of Trauma Recovery 1. Establishing safety 2. Restorative retelling of the Trauma Narrative 3. Restoring Connection between survivor and community (Herman, 1992) 

00:27:25
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Trauma-Informed Child Centered Play Therapy follows Judith Herman's Tri-phasic model of trauma recovery. Establishing safety, restorative retelling of the trauma narrative, restoring connection with family and community. These three overlapping phases are key parts of the NCTSN core components. 

00:27:50
Objective 3a 

00:27:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY In phase 1, the goal was to establish physical and emotional safety. And decrease hyper arousal, intrusive memories and unhealthy avoidance. The methods we will be building on are therapeutic relationship the, ah, Child Centered Play Therapy for the first 30 minutes, and facilitating safety strategies and positive coping skills for the next 15 minutes over a series of sessions. In Trauma-Informed Child Centered Play Therapy we established safety by creating a warm inviting playroom or play area. It should be regarded as a sanctuary of refugee and protection. Toys are selected not collected, they are organized and displayed in a systematic way. There are real life toys, acting out or aggressive released toys, and creative expressive or emotional released toy. Many of these toys can be purchased at your local toy store or at childtherapytoys.com. Let me show you these toys now. 

00:29:05
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Welcome to our special play area. I'd like to show you the category of toys. First, we have real life toys, such as baby dolls and a baby bottle. It's important to have the type of dolls that match the ethnicity of your clients. You would also wanna have cooking equipments along with play food and a doctor's kits as well as a doll house so that children can show what's going on in their home. The next category of toys are the aggressive released toys over here, we have them carefully organized where you have things such as handcuffs, phone and a knife, as well as our most controversial item which is a gun. It's important to have a wide range of toys such as these so that children can express all of their feelings. Some children may need to express anger and to take out revenge on someone who's hurt them very deeply. Don't worry remember we will be setting therapeutic limits and we'll teach the children that people are not for shooting, but they can choose to shoot the Bobo. Speaking of Bobo it's very important to have a bat(ph) bag or sometimes called Bobo also at some point controversial item. But I find that it's helpful for children to be able to reenact things and sometimes they need to demonstrate what has happened or just get a sense of power by releasing their aggression on something safe. We also gave creative expressive toys such as a wide range of puppets from scary puppets to wise old owls to nurturing puppets. As well as a wide range of people. Other creative expressive toys include pipe cleaners, paper, crayons, markers, we also have musical instruments so that children can learn to keep a rhythm and self-soothe, this helps regulate the brainstem and cerebellum.

Play Therapist Core Conditions • Rogers (1951) said the three core conditions for therapy are: - Unconditional Positive Regard - Empathy - Genuineness 

00:31:35
JENNIFER BAGGERLY In addition to the physical environment the emotional environment needs to be established by the play therapist implementing Carl Rogers' three core conditions of unconditional positive regard, empathy and genuineness. These core conditions can be operationalized, be a frequent face to face gaze, warm facial gestures, tender tone and moderate pitch, predictable physical movements and gentle touch by care givers. When play therapist and caregivers are calm and fully at tune with children they produce a harmonic emotional state that actually synchronizes their neural activity, heart rates and hormonal systems. These process when continuously repeated allows the child to synchronized his or her automatic responses with the adult thereby providing the neuro pathways for future adoptive self-regulation.

Axline's 8 Basic Principles 1. Warm, friendly relationship 2. Accept child exactly as is 3. Establish permissiveness 4. Reflect feelings 5. Respect child's ability to problem solve 6. Child leads; therapist follows 7. Don't hurry; gradual process 8. Only establish limits as needed 

00:32:40
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Building on Rogers' core conditions, Virginia Axline develop eight basic principles in working with children. Review this list and identify your two strengths and your two areas for growth. It is important to implement basic child-centered play therapy skills as describe by Landreth. First, tracking children's play behavior. State what the child is doing with the toys. Refrain from asking questions, refrain from naming objects the child is using in the unconventional way and it's not yet identified. Rather make simple statements that start with you or that such as, You are moving the car right through there, or that one is on top of the little one. The rate of tracking should match the child's activity level rather than sounding like a sports announcer try a rate of one response every 15 to 30 seconds. Watch this demonstration. 

00:33:50
JENNIFER BAGGERLY You got that you-- looks like your feeding the baby. And you want it to give it to me. You got that one. You want me to hold that too. You found those, you got them on, you knew right where they went. 

00:34:20
KATELYN BAGGERLY I was checking it if they fit but they don't. 

00:34:20
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh, you are little disappointed they didn't fit the way you wanted. So you decided to put them on me. 

00:34:30
KATELYN BAGGERLY Yes, Mommy. 

00:34:30
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Reflect content by paraphrasing what the child is saying. For example if the child says, "The bad guy robbed the bank, the cops came and his going to jail." You can reflect the bad guy is being punished. The third skill is reflecting feelings. First, we must recognized that all feeling are acceptable. Start with, "You feel," or if the child is projecting on to the toy state that, "That one is angry." It's particularly important to track and reflect feelings when you observe the child engage in a natural self-soothing play activity. For example, you are rocking back and forth on that bat(ph) bag and you feel calm. Watch as I demonstrate how to reflect these feelings. 

00:35:25
KATELYN BAGGERLY Now let's check. 

00:35:30
JENNIFER BAGGERLY And you knew what to do with that one? 

00:35:35
KATELYN BAGGERLY Now she's all sets. 

00:35:35
JENNIFER BAGGERLY You're happy with how she is now. You feel relieve that she's okay. 

00:35:45
KATELYN BAGGERLY Today, it's going to be a wonderful, day today. 

00:35:50
JENNIFER BAGGERLY You really happy with this day. You got a rhythm there. You like that. Just beating the drum in a special way. 

00:36:05
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Return responsibility when children look to you for direction or when they ask for help to do something they can do on their own. If they say, "What should I do?" Respond with, "In here, you can decide." If they say, "Open this for me." Respond with, "That's something you can try." Encourage children's efforts rather than praising their product. When they are working hard on something say, "You're really working hard on that." When they ask you, "Do you like my picture?" Rather than saying, "Yes, it's pretty," respond with, "You made the picture just the way you want it with blue over here and colors all over." Build the child's self-esteem by giving them credit for what they know or what they achieve. Try, "You know a lot about dinosaurs," or, "You did it!" Again when you observe the child naturally self-soothing after getting upset give her credit. You are frustrated with that broken toy, but you knew how to calm your heartbeat and breathing down by taking a deep breath." Let see how I demonstrate these skills. 

00:37:20
KATELYN BAGGERLY Check the temperature of her baby. 

00:37:25
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh, you want me to make sure that the baby is okay. 

00:37:30
KATELYN BAGGERLY And you pretend you are the doctor. 

00:37:30
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay, and you want me to be the doctor. Ah, Katelyn in here you can show me how to be the doctor. 

00:37:35
KATELYN BAGGERLY Oh, the doctor, oh, I forgot something. Here's the doctor is boy will need. 

00:37:45
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay, you and-- so you knew where this went. And in here you can show me what to do with them. You knew where you wanted to put that. 

00:37:55
KATELYN BAGGERLY Is it-- is she healthy? 

00:37:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY What should I say? 

00:38:00
KATELYN BAGGERLY Yes. 

00:38:00
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yes, she's healthy. 

00:38:05
KATELYN BAGGERLY Now let's check... 

00:38:05
JENNIFER BAGGERLY And you knew what to do with that one. 

00:38:10
KATELYN BAGGERLY Now, she's all sets. 

00:38:10
JENNIFER BAGGERLY She's-- you're happy with how she is now. You feel relieve that she's, okay. 

00:38:20
KATELYN BAGGERLY Today it's going to be a wonderful day today. 

00:38:25
JENNIFER BAGGERLY You really happy with this day. You got a rhythm there. You like that. Just beating the drum in a special way. You found a dress. And you know how the dress is go on. Got it over your head. And your working hard to get that-- your arm through that hole, and you did it. You got that dress on just like you wanted. Hmm, you took a deep breath to calm yourself down. 

00:39:20
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Therapeutic limit setting is implemented to keep people and property safe. The steps are A, acknowledge the feeling, C communicate the limit, and T target and alternative. For example, "Joshua I know you'd like to shoot me but people are not for shooting. You can choose to shoot the toys." Watch this demonstration of how I set limits. 

00:39:50
JENNIFER BAGGERLY London, I know you'd like to shoot me, but people are not for shooting you can choose to shoot the Bobo. 

00:39:55
LONDON BELL Okay. 

00:39:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY You got it. 

00:40:00
JENNIFER BAGGERLY The second part of establishing safety is to provide 15 to 20 minutes of psycho-education after 30 minutes of Child Centered Play Therapy. This is a time that you can invite parents into the session so that they can learn and reinforce knowledge and skills to establish safety. First, it's important for play therapist to assess the coping skills the child and family have you used in the past. One way I do this is by explaining that after something scary happens, children and adults notice changes in their body and things they do or think. I explain the big five areas of physiological, behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and spiritual. Then I tell them that many children and families have already have ways to feel better in each of these areas. 

00:40:50
Develop Coping Skills: "The Big 5" 1. Physiological • Deep breathing, Exercise, Eating healthy 2. Behavioral • Helping others, Playing, 3. Emotional • Identifying feelings, Comfort from caring adults 4. Cognitive • Draw or write, happy thoughts 5. Spiritual • Praying, Singing 

00:40:50
JENNIFER BAGGERLY For example in physiological some people do deep breathing, exercise or eat healthy. In behavior, some people help others or play. For emotions, some talk about their feelings or draw a temperature gauge of how they are feeling. Some will identify a team of people to support them and others will seek comfort from caring adults. For cognitive, some people will draw or tell others what happen, ask questions and think about happy places. And for spiritual, some children will pray or sing. Then I ask the child and family to draw or act out as in charades their usual coping strategies in each area. One activity is a heart shield were children draw their coping skills on a paper plate and hang it around their neck. Identifying the family's usual coping strategies helps be honor their family and cultural values and traditions. In the next psycho-educational session following the 30 minutes of Child Centered Play Therapy, we began enhancing physiological regulation. Colorful children's books can provide basic knowledge. For example, don't pop your cork on Monday explains the fight or flight process and introduces different types of activities. However, for skill development, the play therapist needs to demonstrate and coach children through physiological regulation activities such as body relaxation, deep breathing, butterfly breathing, sensory input, butterfly hugs, rhythmic movement at 60 beats per minute such as rocking or drumming, progressive muscle relaxation. humming and singing, taichi, yoga. Watch how I do some on these with these children and parents. 

00:42:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay, Levi and Mrs. Doris I know that the car accident was really scary for you, so let's learn some ways to calm our selves down. First, were going to do a butterfly breathing. Can you put your hands behind your head for me. That's right. We learn this last time go like that, that helps you breathe deep and, ahhh, take a deep rest, ahhh, okay and now do the butterfly hug like that, that helps you calm down. So when your stomach starts to feel funny you can do that. Now I'm gonna show you something I and, ah, Levi I like you to sit with your Mom and look at your Mom's face. How about you sit over there, there you go buddy, and what will going to do is I'm gonna have Mom put some lotion on your boo boos, okay. So here's some lotion and check, oh, you know where your boo boos are. 

00:43:55
MANDI DORIS Oh. 

00:43:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yes. Cuz Mom is really skilled at taking care of you, Levi, and taking care of all your boo boos. Yeah, very nice. Feels good. Okay. Helps you calm down. Okay. 

00:44:25
JENNIFER BAGGERLY When teaching these skills Gaskell and Perri remind us that it is not a cook book of activities. To the contrary, it is a richly relational and neuro-biological process entered into by a child and an adult who want to be emotionally connected in a particular moment and time. In other words, these activities are simply a way to create the human interaction needed for children to learn internal regulation skills. Remember, which part of the brain are we targeting with this physiological activities? The brainstem and the cerebellum. The lower brain must be regulated with calmness before we can go on to higher brain activities. Subsequent psycho-educational sessions can establishes a symps-- a safety by establishing accurate cognitions through play modalities. A puppet show can be used to increased accurate understanding of children's typical responses after a trauma and address common misunderstandings. Watch this demonstration. 

00:45:35
JENNIFER BAGGERLY This is fireman Fred and this is, ah, a scared little rabbit and I think we need to, ah, ah, have them talk. "Oh, I'm gonna scared of that fireman he looks like his gonna chop me up with an axe." "Oh, no little rabbit I'm here to help people, I know I might look scary but I'm here to help. This axe here is only to open up the cars so that I can rescue people." "But I was so scared." "Oh, you know what, I know a way to help you calm down. Do you know how to put your hands behind your head and breathe?" "Oh, I think I learn that." You wanna show him, Levi? Show them how to put your, ohhh, ohhh. "I'm feeling better already." So I bet this little rabbit is scared of other things. Levi, what do you think the little rabbit is scared of when he, ah, sees the fireman. 

00:46:45
LEVI JOHANON Like the fireman going like chop his ears off. 

00:46:50
JENNIFER BAGGERLY He might-- your, you're thinking that little rabbit thinks she might get hurt and his ears might been chopped off. "Oh, no I'm here to help people. I'm a good person." And what else might he be scared of? What will the little rabbit-- what else might he be scared off? 

00:47:15
LEVI JOHANON Like he's Mommy has to go to the hospital, you'll be like scared all alone? 

00:47:20
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh, yeah. I'm-- that's right, I'm scared that if, if the fireman takes Mommy out of the car then I'll be all alone." "Yes, lots us kids are scared about that but guess what, fireman have lots of people to help, like policeman and we even have telephones to call the family of kids who are in a car accidents. So fireman never leave kids alone and always get somebody to help them." "Oh, well it was really scary being away from my Mom." Levi, do you know how to tell the little rabbit what he can do to calm himself down when he is afraid, when he is away from his Mom, what could the little rabbit do? 

00:48:10
LEVI JOHANON Do it like a butterfly? 

00:48:10
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah, he can do the butterfly hug. That's great Levi, you're learning that's. 

00:48:20
JENNIFER BAGGERLY In the activity garbage or treasure, the therapist writes out common thoughts and actions of children and ask them to sort out the ones that are wasteful, garbage, and the ones that are valuable, treasure. Watch this demonstration. 

00:48:40
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay, London and Mrs. Bill, we've been working on the story book for London about what's been happening in the family. And remember London last time we finished a story book about how you used to live with your Mom and her boyfriends and then, uhm, the boyfriend was hurting Mom. 

00:49:00
LONDON BELL Yeah. 

00:49:00
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah. And then boyfriend move out and now your feeling a little bit safer but you're, uhm, still sometimes a little worried about things. So, today we're going to play a game, it's called garbage or treasure. So, what we're gonna do is I'm going to tell you some things and if you think the statement is true you say treasure, but if you think it's not true then you say garbage. 

00:49:35
LONDON BELL Okay. 

00:49:35
JENNIFER BAGGERLY All right, so let see here's the first one. It's okay for adults to hit and stab other adults. Is that garbage or treasure? 

00:49:45
LONDON BELL I think that's garbage. 

00:49:50
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yes, that's garbage. What do you think Mom? 

00:49:50
LYNN BELL That's a definitely garbage. 

00:49:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY That's garbage, okay. And here's another one. I have a right as a kid to be safe. Is that garbage or treasure? 

00:50:00
LONDON BELL Treasure. 

00:50:05
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Treasure, okay. Now here's another one. When Mom got hit by her boyfriend it was my fault. Is that a garbage or treasure? 

00:50:15
LONDON Garbage. 

00:50:15
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Garbage, okay. Okay, here's, ah, tricky question. Since I'm a boy it's my responsibility to protect my Mom. 

00:50:25
LONDON BELL Yeah. Yes. 

00:50:25
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh, so you, you think that might be treasure. Well, let me check in. Mom what do you think? And London is just a boy, do you think it's his responsibility to protect you? 

00:50:35
LYNN BELL Uhm, no, absolutely not, it's his-- my job to keep him safe. 

00:50:40
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. 

00:50:40
LYNN BELL And, ah, and not his job to keep me safe. 

00:50:45
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay, so do you hear that London. Your Mom believes its her job be keep you safe and your just a boy, so, uhm, whose job is it to keep you safe than Mom? Your job? 

00:50:55
LYNN BELL Yeah. 

00:50:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay, and, ah, you're telling me also that you were getting some help from your friends and your church, with that. 

00:51:05
LYNN BELL Yes. 

00:51:05
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. So, a lot of kids, boys, especially think it's their responsibility to keep their Mom safe but really its Mom's responsibility and she's getting help from friends and from church and probably from family as well. So let's try that again. Is it your responsibility to keep your Mom safe. 

00:51:25
LONDON BELL No, doesn't. 

00:51:25
JENNIFER BAGGERLY That's it you got it now, all right. Thanks for playing that game with me. 

00:51:30
LONDON BELL Okay, you're welcome. 

00:51:35
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Other psycho-educational strategies to establish safety are helping children develop a safety plan, an emergency kid. Reviewing appropriate physical and social boundaries, teaching assertiveness messages such as stop now, and advocating for environmental safety and stability in home and school. 

00:51:55
Objective 3b Phase 2: Facilitate Trauma Narrative • "Children will not stop their disturbing repetitious, often secretive post-traumatic play until they reach an emotional understanding." (Terr, 1980) • How? 

00:52:00
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Phase 2 is facilitating the restorative retelling of the trauma narrative. Lenore Terr said, "Children will not stop their disturbing repetitious, often secretive post-traumatic play until they reach an emotional understanding." How the children reach an emotional understanding? First, by experiencing safety and physiological regulation in play therapy. And then engaging in symbolic play to explore and sort out their trauma narrative. Play therapy facilitates the narrative. Piaget said symbolic play helps in the resolution of conflicts and also in the compensation of unsatisfied needs. Landreth said toys are children's words and play is their language. As children naturally play out their trauma narrative, play therapist reflect children's content and feelings in a caring manner. 

00:52:55
"The feeling of comfort - often communicated through the sound of our voice, the position of our body, the look on our face as it reflects our inner experience of compassion - will initiate new neural firings that will now become associated with, and ameliorate, the suffering contained in the neural nets of frightening and repeated childhood events." -Badenoch (2008) 

00:53:00
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Badenoch stated, "The feeling of comfort - often communicated through the sound of our voice, the position of our body, the look on our face as it reflects our inner experience of compassion - will initiate new neural firings that will now become associated with, and ameliorate, the suffering contained in the neural networks of frightening and repeated childhood events." Consequently, play therapist's therapeutic responses while the child is engaged in post-traumatic play will alter their experience of painful memories. So how do we know when a child is engaged in trauma specific play behavior and play themes? There is repetitive reenactment of play that is intense, rigid, serious, not light-hearted and there is affect disregulation. The play therapist should look for play themes. 

00:54:00
Play Themes (Benedict, 2007, Finkelhor & Browne, 1985) - Seeking safety/hiding - Power and Aggression - Abuser - Victim - Rescue or Protective - Secrecy - Neglect and Abuse - Failed Nurturance - Broken and Fixing - Mastery - Traumatic sexualization - Betrayal - Stigmatization 

00:54:00
JENNIFER BAGGERLY According to Helen Benedict and others, common play themes of traumatized children are, seeking safety, power and aggression, abuser victim, rescue or protection, secrecy, neglect and abuse, failed nurturance, broken and fixing, mastery, traumatic sexualization, betrayal, stigmatization. When these play themes are apparent, facilitate understanding by reflecting the play themes through statements such as, "You are strong and powerful!" Or, "The baby needs someone to take care of it but no one did." You can also facilitate understanding of children's play by identifying their needs, perspective, intentions, experience, modus and proposing accurate cognitions in time. For example, you believe he hurt you because you were bad, even though adults are not allowed to hurt children no matter what. 

00:55:05
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Of course, this type of proposing accurate cognitions must be sensitively timed for later sessions, so children will not feel that their feelings or perceptions are being dismissed. Another play therapy procedure for promoting the trauma narrative is to expand the meaning of the child's play by connecting the here and now play to other experiences. For example, "The puppy is crying after that tiger hit it, maybe like you cried when that mean kid hit you." Psycho-education for facilitating trauma narrative can also be done through bibliotherapy. Select an appropriate children's book to demonstrate how the beginning, middle and end of a trauma narrative occurs. 

00:55:55
Psycho-education: Begin Facilitating Trauma Narrative via Bibliotherapy • Kids Need to Be Safe: A Book for Children in Foster Core by Julie Nelson & Mary Gallagher • A Terrible Thing Happened by Margaret Holmes • Brave Bart (Sheppard, 1998) • A Family That Fights by Sharon Chesler Bernstein • Annabelle's Secret by Amy Barth (Sexual Abuse) • Dudely: Hope for Children Living in an Alcoholic Family by Jackie Endraske • Alex and the Amazing Dr. Frankenslime by Margot Desannoy (parent alcoholism) 

00:55:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY For example, look at these titles. These books normalized the trauma narrative process in a relaxing non-threatening way. If you see children becoming disregulated as you read the book, prompt them to do the physiological regulation activities that you thought them. In subsequence psycho-educational sessions, after the Child Centered Play Therapy part of the session, begin a step-by-step approach to children's own trauma narrative. Start with the kinetic family drawing in which the child draws each person in the family doing something. Then discuss what each member is feeling, thinking and would like to say to the others. Then develop a timeline of events. And talk about the feelings and thoughts and needs of each person. For example, first you live with Mom and Dad, what fun things did you do there? What upsetting things happen there? Then what happened? This timeline would be the beginning of children's own story book that you help them make. The child draws pictures and you can write the words. As the child tells a story, sensitively ask what was the worst moment and ask what were their thoughts, feelings and needs at that worst moment. Then ask what happen next and what happen to make it better. Of course this must be sensitively timed when the child is physiologically regulated. Monitor their regulation and use a soft encouraging voice to coach regulation or strategies of deep breathing, etcetera. For example, I know this is very uncomfortable, your wiggling around the lot and look mad. Let's stop and try butterfly breathing. As you make progress through the trauma narrative you may noticed some misunderstandings such as blaming self for believing everyone is mean. To facilitate depersonalization, accurate attribution and alternative endings, you can use puppets or a game called radio talk show host to sort out thoughts of kids who have experienced the same issue. In the puppet show have one wise old puppet answer questions of common misunderstandings from a scared little puppet. For example, a scared kitten can ask a line if it was her fault that someone touch their private parts. The wise lion would say, "No, grownups know they are not supposed to do that, it's always the grownups' fault." Then the wise lion can teach the kitten how to roar for help. In the game radio talk show (inaudible ) books the play therapist pretends a scared caller calls in for answers to common misunderstandings. The child speaks using the microphone to give accurate information. Watch this demonstration. 

00:59:20
JENNIFER BAGGERLY All right, London, and Mrs. Bell. Now we're gonna play a game called Talk Show Radio. And this is how it is, there's gonna be a caller who calls in to the radio talk show and they're going to need some expert advised from, ah, guys like you. So, you're gonna have this microphone and you're going to say what you think, what the answer should be. So, I hear the phone ringing. Hello, yes, ah, go right ahead with your question. Yes, well, ah, I'd like to know, uhm, when boy say their Mom is getting, ah, beat up by their other boyfriends, well, what they are supposed to do? Ah, well, we happen to have an expert here, ah, Mr. London Bell, ah, Mr. Bell what would you like to say to kids who see their Moms get beat up. What do you think they should do? 

01:00:15
LONDON BELL I think they should, I think they should, uhm, beat them up cuz there would be even so cuz-- that's, that's the right thing to do. 

01:00:30
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. So, so you think the boy should be that the, the ones that are beating up their Mom's, okay. So, let's see, ah, let's pass the microphone over to your Mom, ah, now Mr. Bell said that the boy should beat up the, the big man who were maybe hurting Mom. What do you think? 

01:00:55
LYNN BELL I really-- he seen that happen and I, I don't like that he's, he's seen that happen, uhm, so he's very protective of me and I know probably he should, ah, - 

01:01:10
JENNIFER BAGGERLY He's got a lot of anger. 

01:01:10
LYNN BELL - go get, go get help. 

01:01:15
JENNIFER BAGGERLY All right, okay. So you would like to be strong and to protect Mom into get revenge, uhm, but, ah, let see your this high how, how big was boyfriend. This high? Okay. Very big. So how about if you say go get help, so let's try again. So how would you go get help. Tell me a way that to go get help. How should I go get help? 

01:01:40
LONDON BELL Uhm, I think you should go next door or, or find the policeman. 

01:01:45
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. That's a great idea. Well thank you, thank you. Opp, here comes one more call. Ah, hello your on the Talk Show Radio. What is your question? Yes, well my question is, uhm, are kids ever gonna be able to grow up and to be nice without hitting another kids? Are they ever going to be able to do that? Oh, wow, what do you think, ah, Mr. expert, Mr. London what do you think? If a little kid sees adults hitting others, do you think they can grow up to be calm people without hitting others. 

01:02:30
LONDON BELL Uhm, if you just teach them right uhm, you could do that. 

01:02:35
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. So you're saying kids can learn how to be calm, all right. And, and let see here, or let's pass the microphone to your Mom and Mom, ah, tell us how do you think it's best for kids, uhm, to be able to learn not to, ah, be violent and hit other people. What's-- how they were gonna learn that? 

01:02:55
LYNN BELL Uhm, by example, obviously. 

01:03:00
JENNIFER BAGGERLY By example and by and for-- you probably have some-- London are there people in your life that you know some men who were very kind and don't hurt others. 

01:03:10
LONDON BELL Uhm, I have Uncle Eric. 

01:03:15
JENNIFER BAGGERLY You have Uncle Eric and do you have, ah, grandfather? 

01:03:20
LONDON BELL Yeah. 

01:03:20
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah, grandfather, okay. 

01:03:20
LONDON BELL Uhm, my Uncle. 

01:03:25
JENNIFER BAGGERLY And your other Uncle. Great. And then what about places that you can go to help yourself learn to calm down and to be happy? Are there places that you go? 

01:03:30
LYNN BELL We really, we, we have good friends that we like to go over and go out in the country, go for rides on the bike - 

01:03:40
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. 

01:03:40
LYNN BELL - to the park. 

01:03:40
JENNIFER BAGGERLY All right. Good. You found peaceful places to go and to help calm your body down. 

01:03:50

01:03:50
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Right. Okay. Well, that is our radio talk show and thank you so much for coming in today. 

01:03:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Alternative endings to trauma stories, meaning of the event, messages, morals and a hopeful future should be explore in the same playful way and documented in the child's trauma story book. The objective is to end the trauma story on a hopeful note. So that the child has a sense of resolution and hope for a bright future. Once this is achieved children are allowed to invite safe people, caregivers or trusted friends into the playroom to hear their story. 

01:04:30
Objective 3c 

01:04:35
JENNIFER BAGGERLY The last days is to restore connections with others. Throughout Trauma-Informed Child Centered Play Therapy, play therapy should provide parent or caregiver consultation. Caregivers and parents are partners in the process. They need safe, caring, warm relationships with the play therapist as well as others. Although, the play therapist maintain confidentiality on specifics in play therapy sessions, they may share general things such as your child is working through the idea of good versus bad and it's developing an internal sense of power. The play therapist may also need to provide the caregiver information on meeting their basic needs, self-care, safety planning and where to obtain their own counseling so that they can maintain physiological regulation for their child. As previously mentioned parents and caregivers are invited into the psycho-education of establishing safety. During this time the play therapist facilitates caring connections between the caregiver and child. By leading them through some common theraplay activities as describe by Phyllis Booth and Jernberg or I Love You Rituals as describe by Becky Bailey. 

01:05:55
I love you rituals (Becky Bailey, 2000) • Positive Nursery Rhymes - What a wonderful child you are • Friend Handshakes - Add new moves to handshake • Soothing Games - Putting lotion on hurts • Active Games - Cotton ball blow 

01:05:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Some of their common nurturing activities are positive nursery rhymes such as what a wonderful child you are sung to the tune of Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star, friend handshakes where you add new moves to handshake, soothing games such as putting on lotion on hurts, and active game such as cotton ball blow. Some caregivers may benefit from child parent relationship therapy or filial therapy describe by Bratton and Landreth. Other caregivers may need your social justice advocacy with court schools and legislation.

JENNIFER BAGGERLY The resources listed in the guide would benefit caregivers and you. In summary, there are hundreds of thousands of traumatized children in the United States yet there is hope for recovery. I trust the awareness, knowledge and skills you have learned through Trauma-Informed Child Centered Play Therapy will empower you to bring healing to children. Thank you for the work you do.

Do you know that this part of your brain right here this is sort like the back part of your brain. This is called the brainstem and, ah, that helps us breathe and it helps our heart rate keep going. Can you put your hand on your-- in-- on your heart? Well, that part helps us breathe and the heart rate and this is the, the cerebellum and that helps us to, uhm, to have activity and sometimes what happens when something scary people go, "Oh!" Like that and they get scared and maybe they trying run away or they fight or something. And then this right here. This, this right here go like that with your thumb that's called the limbic system. This is up in your head right there and that has to do with your, your, ah, emotions when you feel happy or when you feel sad. And this part is like the cerebellum and this is what helps you think. And have you ever noticed like sometimes when you get like scared you kind of flip your lid where it's hard for you to think. Have you noticed that Mom sometimes when you get sc-- upset or something - 

01:29:05
MANDI DORIS Yes. 

01:29:05
JENNIFER BAGGERLY - that's hard for you to think and you just kind of flip your lid? 

01:29:10
MANDI DORIS Yes. 

01:29:10
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yes. And so, what happens when sometimes something scar--, kids sometimes noticed things that are different in their brain and their body. Uhm, have you noticed anything different Levi after your accident have you noticed anything different in your, in your body? Does anything been hurting you in your body? 

01:29:30
LEVI JOHANON Yeah.

JENNIFER BAGGERLY Yeah, its yeah. It's like something is hurting your ribs and your, and your stomach is hurting. Yeah. Okay. And, and what else have you noticed Mrs. Doris what else have you noticed? 

01:29:45
MANDI DORIS He's, Levi has had a lot of nightmares. 

01:29:50
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. Yeah. That's part of that. Very quite. 

01:29:50
MANDI DORIS And he's, he's been really quite. 

01:29:55
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Okay. Yes. These are, are things that happen to kids, after something scary many kids feel, ah, upset in their stomach and many kids have nightmares and maybe trying to hide like little Tucker the turtle. but you know what were gonna do here in play therapy? Were gonna give you time to play and you're gonna have 30 minutes of playing and then together we're going to help teach you how to calm your body down. So that you can come and play instead of hiding like the little turtle in there cuz when Tucker is hidden like that do you think he has much fun? 

01:30:30
LEVI JOHANON No. 

01:30:30
JENNIFER BAGGERLY No, he can't play with the toys. And he can't make friends. So we want to help you so you are brave and, ah, so you won't have the upset stomach or upset, ah, thought, upsetting thoughts. So Levi, Mrs. Doris, what are you usually do to help try to calm your bodies down when something happens at home or school that you don't like, what is that something that you usually do? 

01:31:00
MANDI DORIS Well, we spend some quality time together. We, ah, read books and we pray. And then we play X-box. 

01:31:10
JENNIFER BAGGERLY All right, so you, you, ah, do a lot of things. You play together, you pray, uhm, you spend quality time and it looks like you like holding each other and that's a great way to calm yourselves down. And so, ah, Levi I wanna teach you something new. Can you put your hands behind your head like this? This helps you take deep breaths, this is called, ah, butterfly breathing, wooh. Yes, that helps you calm you down. So if you do this before you go to bed or when you start to have a upset stomach that might help calm you down and then watch this. I learn this from some friend, you can cross hands like this, this is called a butterfly hug. And then you can calm yourself down like that. And then Mom, uhm, actually you holding him it just kind of rocking him. If you just rocking very slowly at, uhm, 60 beats a minute that's like hymn hearing your heartbeat when he was inside you before you were born. Levi, did you know that, that you were inside your Mom and you were hearing her heartbeat and that, that can help calm you down. So that's what so-- these are some of the things we're going to do in our play therapy sessions after you have your 30 minutes of play and we're going to learn something so that Mommy can help you learn to calm down at home and, ah, before you go to school and in the evening. All right. So thank you so much for coming in, you wanna pet Tucker before you leave? All right. We're looking for this the spending time with you and helping you to get better. All right, thank you very much Levi, thank you Mrs. Doris.

Levi, I know that when you were in the car accident a fireman came to try to get Mom out because you were stuck in the car and I know that it was you-- your Mom said it pretty very scary for you. And, uhm, this is fireman Fred and this is, ah, a scared little rabbit and I think we need to, ah, ah, have them talk. "Oh, I'm kind of scared of that fireman, he looks like his gonna chop me up with an axe." "Oh, no little rabbit I'm here to help people. I know I might look scary but I'm here to help. This axe here is only to open up the car so that I can rescue people." "But I was so scared." "Oh, you know what I know a way to help you calm down. Do you know how to put hands behind your head and breathe?" "I think I learned that." You wanna show him, Levi? Show how to put your-- aha, "Oh, I'm feeling better already." So I beat this little rabbit is scared of other things. Levi, what do you think the little rabbit is scared of when he, ah, sees the fireman? 

01:36:30
LEVI JOHANON Like, the fireman is going like chop his ears of. 

01:36:35
JENNIFER BAGGERLY He might-- you're, you're thinking that little rabbit thinks he might get hurt and his ears might be chop off. "Oh, no I'm here to help people. I'm a good person." And what else might he be scared off? What with the little rabbit-- what else might he be scared off? 

01:37:00
LEVI JOHANON Like his Mommy has to go to the hospital, you may get scared all alone? 

01:37:05
JENNIFER BAGGERLY Oh, yeah. "I'm, oh, that's right I'm scared that if, if the fireman takes Mommy out of the car then I'll be all alone." "Yes, lots of kids are scared about that but guess what fireman have lots of people to help like policeman and we even have telephones to call the family of kids who are in a car accidents. So fireman never leave kids alone and always get somebody to help them." "Oh, well it was really scary being away from my Mom." Levi, do you know how to tell the little rabbit what he can do calm himself down when he is afraid, when he is away from his Mom, what could the little rabbit do? 

01:37:55
