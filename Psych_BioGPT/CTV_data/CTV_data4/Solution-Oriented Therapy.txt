00:00:00
BILL O'HANLON This is, ah,-- this is I hope you wanted in the right room. I hope I want it into the right room and, uhm, this is suppose a demonstration of solution orient therapy and I just I wanna say a couple of things and we'll get right to the conversation. And that is-- I to-- I came up with this idea in, uhm, 1977 when I was working with Milton Erickson he was teaching me. And he told me a story and you might imagine Milton Erickson is big on stories. And many you've heard the story but it was about a woman who was quite depress, she lived in Milwaukee. She was the aunt of, uhm, patient of his. And he was going up to give a lecture and this guy said, can you go civic in sort of my Aunt she's suicidally depressed, and Erickson is gonna be there for a couple of hours and he's-- he cures for of suicidal of depressions couple of hours which is why I was so discouraging to study with Milton Erickson. Uhm, the rest of us have to do slab through therapy. But that story that some you know as the African ballet queen of Milwaukee was secede of a different way of working. So after that Dr. Erickson told me that story, I was-- I was in graduate school at the time I was studying with him and I couldn't afford to pay him. So I was his gardener and the, the other students left and I went out to the garden with him and I said, "I was very intimidated by Erickson I was very shy at that time," and I-- but I worked up courage I said, "Dr. Erickson that story about the African ballet queen was so moving to me and you know, you talk about dealing with this woman who is depressed and then you did the small thing with her and she got better." And you know, but I'm in graduate school. And they're telling me if someone's depressed, I just send them to the psychiatrist for medication. I should find about their family history, the genogram of all the depression that runs through their family. I should challenge their irrational and distorted thinking that's part, parcel of the depression. How do I get from that way of working to this African violent way of working. Because basically what we told her was he found some strengths and ability she had. Used those to move her out the world where she was very isolated before. And she got better. And I said, "I wanna learn to work that way." How do I'd learn to think like that? And he look down to ground and he was in wheelchair out but in the garden with me and said, "I looked all around her life everything look depressing." The only side of life I could see was those African violence. And I thought it would easier to grow the African violent parts of her life than to weed out the depression. And we're out the garden so we use of gardening metaphor. And I thought that's great and I was that, that became the direction of my therapeutic career that I wanted to find the African violence in people's lives and grow those parts, the strengths, the abilities which was a radical idea at that time because almost of there be with focus on what was wrong with people. Diagnosis, deficits, damage. And it became my life's passion, it's 36 books so far that it's produced from me to write about this idea of what's right with people and balancing it with recognizing their suffering and their problems and their deficits and the damage. But to use the best of them to help them change and so I've dedicated my life to this idea. And now, its not such a strange idea. Ah, when I first started teaching and people would you know, just have great objections to it or personally attack me occasionally for being a bad person for saying this stuff me, it was just the way to relieve suffering. That was all I was interested in and it seem they really good way to relieve suffering. So, I'd like to demonstrate this Michael has been kind enough to be willing to be in front of you and, and speak about, uhm, his situation and I have no idea what's gonna happen it is just Michael and will just work it out. And we'll find out what happen. So thank you for being here, and thank you Michael for-- so, tell me just a little about two things I guess I wanna know initially, you've-- we've just met about a few minutes ago and as I was going to the bathroom before this started. 

00:04:20
MICHAEL Before. 

00:04:20
BILL O'HANLON Uhm, I said walk with me I need to be moving. Uhm, two parts I wanna know, so one is what's been troubling recently that we might be able to do something about in this conversation. And second thing is what move you-- to, to come up to me in this, you know, sitting in front of these people and you know, take a risk get bit of a risk and so talk to me about both of those of things and whatever way make sense. 

00:04:50
MICHAEL Okay, uhm, what move me first I guess this is standing out the most. Uhm, there's a number of things that I'm troubled with, uhm, and I thought I should pick something reasonably safe. Uhm, and probably, uhm, most manageable on a brief time with meeting with you, ah, family issues, there are different things but, uhm, what hit me, uhm, just moments before I decided to see if I could be volunteer was, uhm, how I-- I didn't feel short until I began online dating. Prior to, you know, my divorce I-- height was like eye color to me. Uhm, brown, blue, green. In post divorce when I started doing online dating, uhm, I started experiencing, uhm, other than very little, uhm, activity. The activity I did that was occasionally responses like, are you really five-two? Uhm, and so it took a while to get over that. And so I started to get creative at least that thought I was. Uhm, and I would say thing, I replied to people since I was getting so much. You know, and I, I send a message to someone and I would say, you're gonna wish I was taller. Uhm, to see and, and that got me some responses actually. But it seems to still either its my personality or it's really the height thing and I keep hearing from women it's the height thing. 

00:06:30
BILL O'HANLON Uh-uh. 

00:06:30
MICHAEL Uhm, I would look over profiles and I try to be respectful, uhm, that the therapy request were guys at this height to that height. Then, I noticed I was never in that category. Uhm, so I decided I had to at least say something, so that's-- where I am. 

00:06:50
BILL O'HANLON So, me say a few things and then I ask a few more things. I'm, I'm a little taller than you but I'm on the short side as you might have noticed. Uhm, and I'm with the person as a little taller than me now, I'm, I'm out of the also into divorce and I'm in another relationship and the person is a little taller than me not radically taller but noticeably taller. And, uhm, so you know, never occurred to her I guess, if it occurred to me I noticed that and, and it never occurred to her she said. And then she was talking to a friend of hers and, and a friend said, she said then you know, Bill said he notices and he wonders of other people notice and you know or judgmental or have ideas about you know, maybe in taller than him. And, ah, her friend said, "Oh, I always love it to see, you know, a guy with a woman who is taller than him cuz I think he must have it going on." That never occurred-- so its nice get a little feedback on the presentation but not, not this early we'll wait for the feedback. Uhm, so, you know, I think people, lot of people have issues, you know, you found and you're in a setting which is not the greatest setting because they're doing, you know, they're evaluating really quickly on the most superficial qualities. So, that, that leads me to the question. How did you get in relationships before? Before online dating became the main mode for a lot of people. How did you, you have probably dated before and then you were-- into marriage at least once since so wa-- how that happened? 

00:08:35
MICHAEL Well, actually I didn't a lot. 

00:08:35
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, and even today I wasn't much for date. 

00:08:40
MICHAEL Yeah. Uhm, I was a very, uhm, productive, uhm, child pretty much doing the right thing most of the time but very, very busy. Uhm, and I've-- focused on studies for the most parts I didn't date a lot in high school if it all hardly. And my father... 

00:08:55
BILL O'HANLON Are you shy at all or it's just was, you know, you're it-- what's in your top priority? 

00:09:00
MICHAEL I'd say I was shy, uhm, the years that I was probably most interested, uhm, in dating was when my father was ill. Uhm, around the age of 16, he, uhm, was diagnosed with cancer. And so, from 16 to 19, he was dying. Uhm, and I found myself diving into productivity. Uhm... 

00:09:25
BILL O'HANLON To just get the pain of that or there was... 

00:09:30
MICHAEL I think so-- I think it was in denial. 

00:09:30
BILL O'HANLON Was tough along. 

00:09:30
MICHAEL It has been denial. 

00:09:30
BILL O'HANLON Denial. 

00:09:30
MICHAEL Uhm. 

00:09:35
BILL O'HANLON The way it destruct yourself kind of thing. 

00:09:35
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:09:35
BILL O'HANLON Okay. 

00:09:35
MICHAEL Over a lot of load, uhm, between work and school did as much as I could. 

00:09:40
BILL O'HANLON So that was and you did some dating and then in two not only we were you productive but you did some dating? 

00:09:45
MICHAEL Minimally. 

00:09:45
BILL O'HANLON Uh-uh. 

00:09:45
MICHAEL Uhm, I had, uhm, towards the end of my bachelors coming home on a spring break, uhm, I had another girl with a friends party where I fell very much in love with then we were engaged. Uhm, and I went away to graduate school in Michigan and she had just left her home, got her first job and for Myers, Florida. Uhm, and it was her first time out of home and professional career, everything. And it fell apart. 

00:10:20
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:10:20
MICHAEL And so I, I had continued and she left at the time I think I was probably just close to dealing with my fathers death. Uhm, like I said I work really hard of avoiding it. He got an associates to be in one year in the semester working, bachelors a year later that the-- so, I think I'm still probably not effectively having dealt with both of us, my father and, ah, fiancee and then I meet my now - 

00:10:50
BILL O'HANLON Now, former wife? 

00:10:50
MICHAEL - former wife. Uhm, we had shifted from Michigan to Indiana and I was a waiter at that time when I met her. And I think I slid into that, uhm, but just... 

00:11:00
BILL O'HANLON But were, were you're, you're gone by this things really quickly so I have to stop you. And that is, you know, you have this party but how did the relationship developed? I'm aware you're sitting down and she didn't know you were the most short or what? 

00:11:15
MICHAEL She wa-- she was short. 

00:11:15
BILL O'HANLON She was. 

00:11:15
MICHAEL But, ah, like I said, you know, I was short back then. 

00:11:20
BILL O'HANLON Right. 

00:11:20
MICHAEL Uhm, I, I don't know I just reconnected easily I-- uhm. 

00:11:25
BILL O'HANLON How? 

00:11:30
MICHAEL Attraction, spirit. 

00:11:35
BILL O'HANLON Conversation. 

00:11:35
MICHAEL I was, uhm, even I was just there for the week, uhm, visiting a friend and I was in that supposed to be that party per se so, it just, uhm, I don't know it so long ago. 

00:11:45
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. But I mean, somehow there was this chemical, you know, attraction or some, something that would felt some panic over between to you. And it felt again kind of easy in a certain way not work, you didn't have to work out of it. 

00:12:00
MICHAEL Not at all. 

00:12:00
BILL O'HANLON It happened and that was nice and, you know, sad that it fell apart. And then in the same thing so that's why so slid passes little quickly, you said, "I deserve a slid into this really." What-- how did you meet her, ah, the, the former wife now. How did that happen? How did do they go farther than just that there this a initial kind of spark between you two? 

00:12:20
BILL O'HANLON Ah, I was waiter at pizza hut, uhm, they were patrons and I was just joking with the table, uhm, they had said something that I mentioned, uhm, it sound really convoluted over and there was-- there was going on. They left a note, uhm, and apparently she was coax by her friends to re-- they wrote the note and had to put her phone number. 

00:12:45
BILL O'HANLON Subtle. 

00:12:50
MICHAEL And so I call her that night we went out to a movie. And that was it. 

00:12:55
BILL O'HANLON So, okay, cuz this is helpful to me and then a couple of other things. So, I'm really curious about this thing of-- I never thought I was short until I went online dating, I mean, what was your sense of yourself? You know, like you said or I just thought you know, was-- I mean I knew how tall I was or how-- you know, what's height I was but it didn't, it didn't have that valence, it didn't have all that charge to it till now I'm, you know, I'm getting a little push back honored or I think this is a lot of what's going on. You know, tell me about how you thought of yourself in those-- you very hard working productive, you know, all that kind of stuff what else did you think about yourself? What-- how do you consider yourself when you thought yourself-- what-- here's the kind of guy I am if-- my friends were gonna describe me or I'm gonna describe myself. 

00:13:40
MICHAEL Today? 

00:13:40
BILL O'HANLON No, back then. 

00:13:40
MICHAEL Back, back when? 

00:13:45
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:13:45
MICHAEL Uhm. 

00:13:45
BILL O'HANLON You didn't have much. 

00:13:50
MICHAEL I was the guy that everyone could trust. Uhm, I was the guy that you know, had a lot of friends, uhm, girl friends if they were grounded they were allowed to go out with Michael. Uhm,... 

00:14:00
BILL O'HANLON You're safe, not only trustworthy but you were safe. 

00:14:00
MICHAEL I was very safe. Uhm, I thought of myself was high integrity. 

00:14:05
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, it was. Just say more at that what does that mean? I have an idea about that but tell me what that means for you? 

00:14:10
MICHAEL If you had a journal and it was open on the table I won't read it. Uhm, if you loan me money it was coming back to you without question. Uhm, anything that I was, uhm, to take care of it, I took care of it. 

00:14:25
BILL O'HANLON You said you're gonna something, you did? 

00:14:30
MICHAEL I can do it. Right. 

00:14:30
BILL O'HANLON So, okay, kept your word, trustworthy, you know, a good friend and, you know, and trustworthy person. All right. And you talk about how recently this, you know, it sounds like it's been better blow it's like, wow, I never even, you know, I never had this kind of self doubters, wonder about myself. And talk to me about what that's been Mike and really then will-- I have another curiosity after that. 

00:15:00
MICHAEL Uhm, funny, uhm, that's not funny really, uhm, maybe, maybe six months ago I had the realization and I-- and I let myself feel discriminated against in a way. 

00:15:10
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:15:10
MICHAEL Ah, that's what it felt like I had never felt that before. Uhm, you know, joking growing up my best friend who was 6'1 I was his armrest stuff like that. But that was just-- I never felt, uhm, so this the online thing I guess it is like shopping I, I do feel, you know, I do my best to change profile to stand up, it's apparently not the arena I should be in as I'm listening to you. 

00:15:40
BILL O'HANLON It may not-- it may not be the best but it may be possible I'm-- but I'm more interested in also-- I guess what I would say, you know, there-- here's of-- you know, and I think there needs to be a little shifts if you stay online and if that's the direction you're going or even offline the back to your confident, your, your sense of yourself I guess. And so that, that's what it sounds concerning to me its like you know, you get this undermining of your confidence in a certain way. So, that's the question I have to ask you that again will go back in his career little. 

00:16:15
MICHAEL This courage. 

00:16:15
BILL O'HANLON What-- had, had ever another time when you felt like the rag was pull off from under you or you lost your confidence and then somehow you work with yourself back into being, okay, or being more confident. Tell me about the time like that if you can recall it. 

00:16:30
MICHAEL Uhm. 

00:16:35
BILL O'HANLON Time when life threw you and you got back to. 

00:16:35
MICHAEL Florida State University it's kind of a inconsequential but it fits - 

00:16:40
BILL O'HANLON Uh-uh. 

00:16:40
MICHAEL - uhm, I was snare line four years in high school. And I thought-- oh, you know, cuz mighty high, uhm, of any mighty high in Burlington. And there were on the top football team so are, are marching band was pretty good too. And so I thought I'll be old that enough to be in the marching band of Florida state. Not so much. Uhm. 

00:17:00
BILL O'HANLON You got there and... 

00:17:00
MICHAEL There were so much better than me. 

00:17:05
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:17:05
MICHAEL Uhm, and so the initial trials when I saw that they gave us like 24 hours or something like that. A piece to prepare for and I was-- had listen to these people before I grab that the piece. So, I gave it my all, uhm, for 24 hours I prepared something that was much harder I ever done. And I was really impressed with-- that I had mastered it but not good enough to me that match up with those folks. So my discouragement I felt better about my abilities that is have and applied it. I must concern if fine or not, I-- they offered me tri-toms. And if anyone knows a tri-toms are-- but there are three drums about, you know, two large one and a small one maybe it's quad I can't remember anymore, done like long time ago. And I had to decline it. Uhm, I just couldn't do it I must-- not just the size working is was just-- I would be throw me around the field. So, I was discouraged when I first met them but I challenge myself enough that I felt competent to my skills and had to decline not be, uhm, on the section I felt, okay. 

00:18:15
BILL O'HANLON Good. Okay. And so, let, let me ask you one more question and I think that is relevant its a good example, I think. But another question is so you go through divorce and, you know, whether you want it either it was a shock to you but whatever we know often going through that is really throws people and ha-- did it and how did-- how have you come back as far as you come back I guess or have you come back. 

00:18:40
MICHAEL My standard MO, ah... 

00:18:40
BILL O'HANLON He very productive, work art. 

00:18:45
MICHAEL Yeah, uhm. 

00:18:45
BILL O'HANLON Distract yourself? 

00:18:45
MICHAEL When my ex, uhm, left, uhm, she had an affair, uhm, and I was raising the kids by myself one and a half , three and six. Uhm, so, for the last 11 years I've been raising them. Uhm, very busy, I have a vivid images in the beginning of being crashed I mean you really crashed. And I had a good friend-- I, I had to stop my practice I couldn't focus I stop my practice out of ethical duty on top of it. And a good friend thought that I'll be very busy. And so he hired me to change the ducts in his attic. In the middle of summer and fired up. 

00:19:30
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, there you go. 

00:19:30
MICHAEL Uhm. 

00:19:30
BILL O'HANLON No sweat. 

00:19:30
MICHAEL I've been, ah, little sweat. 

00:19:30
BILL O'HANLON Okay, a little sweat. 

00:19:35
MICHAEL Uhm, uhm, taking care of the kids I have, uhm, I've vivid imaginary of, of melon yard with my one and a half year old on my snugly and my 3-year-old on the back carrier and I'm pushing the mower. Uhm, and my other one had to stay by the window at all times I could see her. Uhm... 

00:19:50
BILL O'HANLON Some people wanna marry you right now. 

00:20:00
[sil.] 

00:20:05
BILL O'HANLON Well let's have-- so write your profile down here. Put your number on it. Okay, so sorry. 

00:20:10
MICHAEL It's okay. 

00:20:15
BILL O'HANLON I wanna marry you, I mean what the hell. 

00:20:15
MICHAEL So, that's my MO, that's how I seem to go. 

00:20:20
BILL O'HANLON So you get through by a not going down, doing what you gotta do. Working really hard being really distracted and you distract yourself but it's been some years and you, you think you've recovered and you're not so trying to distract yourself you dealt with the you kind of process the after effects of the doors. 

00:20:35
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:20:40
BILL O'HANLON You, you were crashed and now you stood up then you're standing tall again or not? 

00:20:45
MICHAEL Yeah. Absolutely relationship wise for that. I'm, I'm in a good place I still suffer for what the kids have been through, uhm, in my own life. 

00:20:50
BILL O'HANLON Just hard on them and - 

00:20:50
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:20:50
BILL O'HANLON - and... 

00:20:55
MICHAEL Uhm, I see that's, uhm, still working on that. 

00:21:00
BILL O'HANLON I jus-- I just have to say something because, you know, I have four kids as well, a three step kids in biological child now growing in. You know, stuff happenings in their lives and it just does and Dr. Erickson who was one of my big influence says, he said to me once, he said, "In the Erickson family, we consider the troubles of life like roughage." And that stuck with me through so and I whenever my kids regards to someone I didn't want to go, you know, oh, guys I gonna be they're made fun of its school, they're were bullied in school or they-- somebody said something cruel or they went to a heart break or, you know, or the, you know, marital troubles were influencing I'd think-- I think back to that Erickson thing I think you know, yeah. You can't put-- I mean you went to roughage I went through-- you know, we it moved us in a certain way so to speak. Oh, shit and I move that yeah, that sort of thing, that's, uhm, but you know, it sad for kids but it turns out to that's the stuff that shape you, your fathers death, you know, how you grew up other things that happened that I haven't heard about and then, you know, and you know, some of which you know and some which you don't but they all shape to into what you were. You know, again sorry I'm big story teller so I tell one more story about this and that is, one day I was watching with my now, ex-wife I was watching coverage and I was you know was, you know, I have the remote control because that's testosterone poisoning we have to have that. Uhm, and so I'm flipping through the channels and we get to some infomercial about microdermabrasion. Which is essentially sandpapering your face, ah, with chemicals as far as I can tell. And I said to my wife I, I think I wanna have that done. And she said, "What? Why would you do that?" And I said, "Well, you know, because when I was happy I had a beer and I got some ingrown hairs like this pop marks on my face and you're I, I shouldn't be sitting this way I should be sitting over there on this side. Uhm, and, and you know, I really don't-- I think this just look terrible and she, "Oh." she said, "Never mind, you never go to the doctor why would you voluntarily go for a medical procedure, you know, you're typical guy." And she said, "Number two that's why I feel in love with you." She said, "You would have a baby face otherwise. Your face has character." And I was thinking, I was thinking this my wound, and she was thinking its my character. And then later I thought well that is my character, it became my face after these wounds in a certain way. And that's why I had to think about my kids is like, "Jesus, I do not want them to suffer at all. And I don't want to have any troubles but life just seems to hand us troubles and that's one of that I handled you-- handed to your kids and it will effect them in good and not so good ways. And you try to protect them and it didn't work. 

00:23:40
MICHAEL Right. 

00:23:40
BILL O'HANLON You can't. So that was really hard for you to get through that but somehow... 

00:23:50
MICHAEL We did. I did. 

00:23:50
BILL O'HANLON You did, they did, you did and in certain way it brought you closer together because. 

00:23:55
MICHAEL Two out of three. 

00:23:55
BILL O'HANLON Two out of three of one guy alienated a bit, ah, yeah. 

00:24:00
MICHAEL No, not by. 

00:24:00
BILL O'HANLON Or just messed up? 

00:24:00
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:24:00
BILL O'HANLON Uhm, that's a sad thing. And who knows where that will-- I mean, we're in the middle of the story we're not at the end of the story. 

00:24:05
MICHAEL Right. I mean, you came on time to help. 

00:24:10
BILL O'HANLON Hopefully, yeah. But it brought you together in a certain way with the other one's that you wouldn't have been quite so close, I think. 

00:24:15
MICHAEL Right. Probably. 

00:24:15
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. Okay. So,-- I used to when I was doing couples therapy or sometimes individual therapy with someone who wanted to be in a relationship. And they would say, "Oh, nobody wants me." And you know, I'm terrible they would have. You know, really self-criticism I'd say, here's your assignment, you're to go to the shopping mall or the airport when you can get into the airport without security, uhm, and you just sit there and look at the people that are in relationships. Just look at all the people that are in relationships. Some of those people are terrible looking. And somebody loves-- some of me look at, you think have kids, how did they actually have sex? With the size of their stomachs I don't know how their genitals got together. And they would come back and tell me these stories and said that was the best assignment you ever gave me. I've-- I'm sure I can get married now, and I am sure I can get into a relationship. Somehow people fell in love with you before. Do you have a sense they could again? Or do you have some doubts about that? 

00:25:45
MICHAEL It, it really does seem like I've made it impossible. Uhm, listening to our band and listening to what I'm doing and it does seem like I'm shutting off the possibility somehow and I can't put my finger on it. 

00:26:05
BILL O'HANLON That's the question. So, again, you know, going back to the earlier times, you get this blow with the, you know, what the marching men stuff. And you apply yourself and it doesn't work. I mean, you know, you-- it's not gonna work the way, you know, that, that it was at the-- at the college. And you went on somehow and you've recovered from that, you went on and did other things and you went on and got another profession and things like that. And you went into different direction. So what would it take to not close down the possibilities and what have you learned in your life about when you have close on the possibilities, or when you're distracting yourself away from what you really need to be doing or focusing on, what have you learned about that? And how could it apply now? 

00:26:50
MICHAEL It sounds like the most successful relationships I've had is one I wasn't looking for one. Uhm, and, uhm, when I was most centered with whatever what I was doing at the time. 

00:27:10
BILL O'HANLON And so-- what-- and then that's my-- that's and now we got know of it. And you know, it probably won't happen through a computer because they can't see you spontaneously being as you are which people hear, saw and were moved a bit to feel closer to your interested in you. It's hard to see that through the computer, so, yeah, you maybe right, that, that's not the right setting but it maybe the right setting but the question is, you know how do you get... 

00:27:40
MICHAEL Until I get to that place of having at peace with where I am in the moment. 

00:27:45
BILL O'HANLON Right. Centered or whatever you-- I think you're just sort of centered. How do you-- how have you gotten there? How could you get there now if you were gonna, you know, you were gonna be one of the friends and say, "You know, I remember when you do-- that's how you get centered or here's how get centered." What advice would you give yourself? If you were a friend of yours or if somebody who knew you well and say, "Oh, I get there's how you do it." You know, yourself pretty well. How do you get centered? 

00:28:10
MICHAEL It seems like I always when I was in quest for, uhm, on my way to my degree. Uhm, in both circumstances actually. Uhm, It was in my down time from my studies, I wasn't in the middle-- missed of the anything in particular. Uhm, and now it-- raising my kids and, and then my career there's so many things that I would like to do with my career that I'm not even touching on. I have projects, oh, my gosh, uhm, that are just - 

00:28:45
BILL O'HANLON Back union. 

00:28:45
MICHAEL - unfinished all over the place. Uhm... 

00:28:45
BILL O'HANLON But that's doesn't speak to the centered part. How it... 

00:28:50
MICHAEL I think that's symbolic of me being off centered, I think that's is a symptomatic evidence where I'm sitting in. 

00:28:55
BILL O'HANLON Because all these undone things surout-- through out after all theses unfulfilled projects. And even if they were out there in the midst of that how do you find the place that were you centered? How have you in the past in similar circumstances? And how, how could now as-- what's your best idea about that? 

00:29:15
MICHAEL It seems that when I'm just decisive actually. Uhm,... 

00:29:20
BILL O'HANLON Decisive. 

00:29:20
MICHAEL I, I set my sights on something and I just go for it. 

00:29:25
BILL O'HANLON So, if I say-- if i said to you, "Okay, right now what would you set your sights on and go for?" What would be-- a something an example that for right now. 

00:29:40
MICHAEL Well, it seems like, uhm, I really don't know. I don't have anything in my sights. 

00:29:45
BILL O'HANLON You always had that thing right in front of you that you're getting your degree, you know, raising the kids, you're doing this whatever it maybe you're still raising the kids but something else that... 

00:29:55
MICHAEL Everything is on our pilot right now, it seems like, uhm... 

00:30:00
BILL O'HANLON And that 's not a great place for that centered thing. 

00:30:00
MICHAEL It 's not where I like to be. 

00:30:00
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, it's not-- there's nothing you're striving for that really is pulling into that clarity and that centeredness. 

00:30:10
MICHAEL Right. 

00:30:10
BILL O'HANLON And what would that be if you made it up right now? Something that would be worth-- worthy of that focus and that strive. 

00:30:20
MICHAEL I can go through my list of progress. 

00:30:25
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, you could, you know. 

00:30:25
MICHAEL Uhm, I have found that I feel most satisfied, uhm, when I knock something off the list. 

00:30:35
BILL O'HANLON Okay. 

00:30:40
MICHAEL And I think I get overwhelmed when I have iPhone, I'm sure a couple of people a lot here do. And there's this applications that help you organize your time. 

00:30:50
BILL O'HANLON Right. 

00:30:50
MICHAEL Uhm, project management and kind of things. And I've downloaded so many and trying to find the right one. 

00:30:55
BILL O'HANLON Now you need an app to manage all the problem you're making them so - 

00:31:00
MICHAEL Exactly. 

00:31:00
BILL O'HANLON - you know, okay, I'm inventing that one now, that's a great cap, I think. 

00:31:05
MICHAEL And I think if, if-- I think that would be target I could see just if I'm gonna throwing out there is to-- just make a list of all my projects, put it on the calendar and leave by it and knock them out. I will be at peace. 

00:31:15
BILL O'HANLON Okay. 

00:31:15
MICHAEL I'll be-- oh, I have so many. 

00:31:20
BILL O'HANLON You'd be at peace and then you're be more centered. And then one of the side effects of that it might be that you'd be more available, you've be in better place and more centered within yourself. And more available for that spontaneous connection that happened when you were in that kind of place. Not focusing on I gotta have a relationship and let's make one happen. 

00:31:40
MICHAEL That becomes another project. 

00:31:40
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. It becomes another project and its a different kind of project because its hard to make that it, it didn't happened that way, it maybe that's the way it's got to happen I don't know but I, I suspect not. But then you're somehow gonna have to out in front of people like your at the pizza hut, and you were at that party which you didn't even intend to go to. There-- you have to be in the way of someone discovering who you are and connecting to who you are and you connecting to them. And where is that happened? 

00:32:05
MICHAEL I notice that I don't-- I haven't plan that before so if I'm centered in doing my thing it should just happen. 

00:32:15
BILL O'HANLON You'll be out there in the world doing your thing and then somebody, something will be connecting to that energy and you will be connecting to them it maybe, huh. 

00:32:20
MICHAEL That will definitely get me out of the office. Uhm, all my projects require maybe get out and do a lot of things actually. 

00:32:30
BILL O'HANLON Otherwise it's pretty easy to focus on the office stuff - 

00:32:30
MICHAEL In the office. 

00:32:30
BILL O'HANLON - and home. 

00:32:30
MICHAEL Yeah. Other at the same place. 

00:32:35
BILL O'HANLON Other in same place but I mean in your kids, you know, that - 

00:32:35
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:32:35
BILL O'HANLON - stuff at home. Yeah. Okay. Good. Yeah. Okay. So, things that would pull out in the world maybe someone that actually see you. You know, I don't, you know, I don't think they're gonna come and ring the door bell and say, you know, and want to see if a spontaneous relationship develops? So you're probably being out in the world or yeah... 

00:33:00
MICHAEL Got it. 

00:33:00
BILL O'HANLON Add this on. 

00:33:00
MICHAEL - or mine, yeah. 

00:33:00
BILL O'HANLON It's possible and again I think I wouldn't give that up but I would hedge my bets and I would be out in a different place probably cuz, that's what work before. 

00:33:10
MICHAEL Make sense a lot actually. 

00:33:15
BILL O'HANLON All right. Now, I have maybe one more thing that maybe we could consolidate this. 

00:33:25
MICHAEL Pretty excited about getting focused but I'll stay with you. 

00:33:25
BILL O'HANLON That's great, no, okay, it's all right with me. And then we should mess with this, this is good enough. Uhm, but no, I do have one more that is somebody in your life like a best friend of some a teacher who really you encourage, your-- believed in you, or a relative or anything. If they were here right now, what advice do you think they would give you? In this about this stuff we've just been talking about. If they were had listen to this conversation and they knew you better than not more much better than I do. And they would say, Michael here's what I would say to you, what would they say? Who-- imagine, somebody tell us who it is if you can... 

00:34:05
MICHAEL I can tell you the story if we have a few moments. 

00:34:05
BILL O'HANLON Okay, I'll take the story. That's good. 

00:34:10
MICHAEL My father was a psychologist, uhm. 

00:34:10
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:34:10
MICHAEL And I have recollection of way back when I was probably 13, 14, uhm, about once a month or so he and I were drive to the store together just he and I. And, uhm, he was-- he did really well from himself, uhm, financially we lived on the beach, nice house, everything, uhm, so it wasn't hurting. And we go to the store and, and that's part is important by the way. And so we don't-- we'd got to-- Allan(ph) foods, uhm, and we've get three things every time we were there. Uhm, he go to the paper bag book stand, he read about two or three books a week. And he'd find one put it in his back pocket and we go to the butcher and he read, uhm, find sirloin steak and tell the butcher it had to freshly ground doctors orders. And then we go to the ice cream section and back then the best ice cream was Breyers. They didn't have all this awesome stuff today. Uhm, and we'd go to the cash register and he pay for two things and we'd leave. And it took me 20 years to figure out what he was doing for me. Uhm, he knew I adored him more than anyone in the world. He knew that. And he was doing these things that he knew would rub me the wrong way. 

00:35:30
BILL O'HANLON He wanted to do it right. 

00:35:30
MICHAEL Yeah. Yeah. And he knew I would see this cuz how could I not, we did-- we did the same thing every time. And so I think he was trying to show me that I can still love someone immensely in spite of their mistakes. 

00:35:45
BILL O'HANLON Uh-huh. 

00:35:45
MICHAEL And even though I think he was teaching me I still haven't mastered it. 

00:35:50
BILL O'HANLON So if he were here now. 

00:35:50
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:35:50
BILL O'HANLON That's what I wanna hear. So, you, you're not as wise as he is and so bring his wisdom here and speak to-- because you knew him so well, speak to us, to you with his voice. What would he say to you-- having heard this conversation and where you are in your life and where you wanna go on and what you been frustrated by and what would he say to you? 

00:36:15
[sil.] 

00:36:20
MICHAEL Uhm, he rarely spoke to me actually. 

00:36:25
BILL O'HANLON Right. 

00:36:25
MICHAEL Uhm. I think he would say do you what you've always done. 

00:36:35
BILL O'HANLON Do what you've always done and what that mean? What does that mean in this situation? 

00:36:40
MICHAEL Trust myself. 

00:36:45
BILL O'HANLON How? 

00:36:50
MICHAEL Don't bend under the pressures of expectation. Uhm, and relax and enjoy yourself more. Uhm, that's the best I could come up with I think. 

00:37:00
BILL O'HANLON Its pretty good. He's a wise person, you should listen to him probably. Because I think you got thrown a little by this thing you know. I mean you're always been trying to do it right and you know, get it right and all the stuff and he showed you that mistakes there's people still loveable with all mistakes, and that's a good lesson. But also I think this stuff through you and I think that is good advice because when you were just in your self-centered, being as you were you're naturally attractive, you know, there's a certain kind of attractiveness and it doesn't have to do with the so much physical, physical's part of it but it's not mainly that, we're attracted to the people we are attracted to I think because of their hearts, their souls and their beings more than, you know, because eventually if you're with people for a long time they age and you know, they do change from what they look like before and those physical things do change but with somehow we still love those people as they age. You know, your father was dying and he, you know, he change in appearance but that didn't shift the kind of love I suspected, you know, that, that wasn't a cause for not loving him. 

00:38:15
MICHAEL While your talking I keep drifting thinking about him. 

00:38:15
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. And that sounds like his it was your real presence in your life and I wanna to get to know him now because he sound like a character that was, he was such a great story about. For playful for-- fact into that. I also read it a couple of books a week, two or three books a week so I definitely identify with that but, uhm, that is such a weirdest thing for him to have done. I think it's fascinating, I would like-- I would like to talk to him about that but... 

00:38:40
MICHAEL You know, he is kind of-- you know, when I was in the marching band, I mentioned the marching band, uhm, my marching band was hired to for some kinds of twirlers and batons we would march for them, uhm, play for them. And we need our instruments when we can for practice and they were locked up in the band of our high school. Sectionally that I knew how to get in, uhm, we had our instruments I thought the right thing cuz, there are our instruments anyway. And half way through our practice the police picked us all up for having stole these instruments. Uhm, I didn't feel bad, cuz and I didn't think I did anything wrong, uhm, most of my friends are my section they were horrified what was gonna happen when they got home. Uhm, they called my house and my brother answered, and when I told them where I was they said, Gee, you have the wrong guy. 

00:39:35
BILL O'HANLON Mistaken identity, yeah. 

00:39:40
MICHAEL And that's the way it was with everyone in my family with my mistakes and I just was never able to do what they could do for me. Uhm, like that. 

00:39:50
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:39:50
MICHAEL So, so, yeah. 

00:39:55
BILL O'HANLON So, as you're preceding in this, you know, world of being open to the possibilities of relationship including yourself in the likely place where that would occur. I think you do have a sort of a guardian angel, ah, consultants and that's your father and he didn't need to say anything I think its presence is, you know, he seem to do that paper bag book saying as a show rather than tell. And he can-- I think he's be nice just as having as a presence in your confidence support, I think, you know, your wing man or your support team or whatever. Even though he hasn't been around for awhile. 

00:40:35
MICHAEL And I thought of that, I haven't doing that. 

00:40:35
BILL O'HANLON He still around in a certain way. You keep him alive in your heart, in your memory and all that stuff. So, I think it be nice if he could, ah, be my at home co-therapist. And keep you on center line. 

00:40:55
MICHAEL That'll be nice. 

00:40:55
BILL O'HANLON Okay. 

00:40:55
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:40:55
BILL O'HANLON So, any other questions or concerns or things you, you think we didn't talk about or I didn't ask or I should ask that would be helpful, or this is enough for now or what, what your sense? 

00:41:15
MICHAEL Seems like enough, uhm, I have a little doubt in myself that I follow through. Uhm... 

00:41:20
BILL O'HANLON And what would make you a little more certain that you would follow through whatever you think? 

00:41:30
MICHAEL Not developing short term memory loss. 

00:41:35
BILL O'HANLON Not developing what? 

00:41:35
MICHAEL Short term memory loss here. 

00:41:35
BILL O'HANLON That's good. 

00:41:35
MICHAEL If I can, you know, keeping in my mind, uhm, trying to remember the-- how hard that I felt, the--helping me connect the back when were relationships were effective helps a lot. 

00:41:50
BILL O'HANLON Okay, so, where as you get off this stage you-- could you write that down some sort of reminder or you know, put it in your project management. That? 

00:42:00
MICHAEL Oh, I'll put it on my counter as they roll over of that. 

00:42:05
BILL O'HANLON I like that, every week at it it's like that. 

00:42:05
MICHAEL So, until I'll get it its there. 

00:42:10
BILL O'HANLON Until its become automatic and you have to think of that. I like that and I think that's good. Now, so I have another question for you and that is, you know, there is a pinnacle over out here and I wonder if you'd be willing stay here and answer a pinnacle over the folks out here. Uhm, if you'd be willing to answer any questions they might have for you or for me or any observations that might have-- is that okay with you? 

00:42:30
MICHAEL Absolutely. 

00:42:30
BILL O'HANLON All right. Now remind me if what time we have to stop. Three-- of four-fifty, you'll, okay, so we've got about 15 minutes if you will go to the mic. This is Michael and I'm Bill, uhm, and if you have any questions or comments if I don't love the questions I may filter them before they get to Michael. 

00:42:50
 Okay, I have-- I have-- I have a brief comment I just picked up on some of the words that Michael said, he is conversational, assertive, integrity, therefore adults and children, trustworthy, hard working, productive, persistent, decisive, I wonder if that somebody you would like to get to know? 

00:43:05
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. That sound like a good online profile, I mean. Yeah. Write that one down and give to him that's good, that's good. 

00:43:20
MICHAEL I'm gonna forget that. Can you hand it to me later? 

00:43:25
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, yeah. Give the-- give him a copy of that. 

00:43:25
 I would like to say that I'm very tall. 

00:43:25
BILL O'HANLON Short-- where are you? 

00:43:25
 Over here. 

00:43:30
BILL O'HANLON Thank you. Yes. 

00:43:30
 Ah, I used to be a Las Vegas showgirl and so I finally found a little land that I could fit into where people were tall and if I could stand really tall. And quite often when I grow up people say, "How tall are you?" And I, up about as tall as I look and... 

00:43:45
BILL O'HANLON That 's the good answer. 

00:43:45
 And with the social networking sites I will get comments, "Oh, you're just too big for me and now your profiles is nice bigger just too big for me." And so it's like how can I find a good man just tall. And so I just wanna say I piggy back on what's going on here and I really appreciate the process because I've take it up for my own. Thank you. 

00:44:10
BILL O'HANLON Thank you. There's an extra charge for that though. You have live in the tip chart of that, you know, for doing therapy with you, you know, you know, he gets it for free because his on the video you don't get it for free. Okay, thanks, that's nice. 

00:44:25
 And I have a question not regarding this here but - 

00:44:25
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:44:30
BILL O'HANLON - when I'm working with clients and I didn't work mostly with the young people and teens early 20s and around depression are issues. Sometimes when I tried to go to can you remember a time? 

00:44:40
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:44:40
BILL O'HANLON Can you give me-- and, ah, and they can't or they said they don't remember - 

00:44:45
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:44:45
 - or they can't and then I kinda get sometimes I can get stuck when we think of like what was your happiest Hanukkah or Christmas or what was your happiest stay with your Dad, and we don't get anywhere. Where did it go? 

00:44:55
BILL O'HANLON I never had one or I don't remember. 

00:44:55
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:44:55
BILL O'HANLON Uhm, you may have noticed that I told of few stories and that's what I do. 

00:45:00
 Okay. 

00:45:00
BILL O'HANLON I tell stories to evoke associative memories. 

00:45:05
 Okay. That's what I do. 

00:45:10
BILL O'HANLON And to realign thing so that-- a bit-- it's interesting the way you said and I also do what you just did and I don't know if you noticed a bit being an Ericksonian, I noticed that. Can you remember a time you didn't was there at time. 

00:45:20
 No, yeah. 

00:45:20
BILL O'HANLON Because per-supposing there was a time and right now they may not remember it. I've had people 20 minutes later say, "Oh, you know, were talking about something totally different than that, oh, you know, there was a time when I and it's like the seed was planted there but you know I just keep wondering around until I find something that's a strength and ability are useful idea and notion memory. And it doesn't always it-- its not linear, it doesn't, oh, yeah, here's is it, and that's the solution to my problem-- things bye, it's almost never like that, its more like this wondering around and having a conversation and then, oh, that's an interesting thing tell me more about that. Or, you know, what about this? You know, I just get a curious and most of time it doesn't lead anywhere or except to an interesting conversation. But it doesn't lead to a solution and then sometimes it does. 

00:46:10
 Thank you. 

00:46:10
BILL O'HANLON You're doing great. 

00:46:10
 Bill, uhm, over here, stage left. 

00:46:15
BILL O'HANLON Thank you. Oh, thank you, it's hard did they lights the right, man. It's here. 

00:46:15
 You know, is just a man speaking to another man up there-- the statement that kept coming to my mind is your integrity makes you 7 feet tall. Right on, brother. 

00:46:35
BILL O'HANLON That's very nice. And I don't know whose next sorry. 

00:46:40
 Uhm, my name is Leigh(ph) I was just, uhm, interested, it remind of me of many people I know and myself too where one can recite all of the terrific qualities that we have and I was wondering if you could speak to how you get the person to feel the sense of appropriate value for having those qualities as suppose to yeah-yeah on this, on this, on this I do these wonderful things blah, blah, blah. But why don't I get the kind of, uhm, like, wow, are yo something else? You know, wa-- how do you deal with that little piece? 

00:47:20
MICHAEL May I answer how you do that for me. 

00:47:25
BILL O'HANLON Yes, thank you, thank you. 

00:47:25
 Yeah, Michael would you answer that. 

00:47:25
BILL O'HANLON He's got a way better answer than I do. 

00:47:30
MICHAEL Uhm, well, Bill has taking back to the times that I had effective relationships, it helped me remember where I was effective, uhm, and there was some varied solutions that he helped me find in there. And so the parts about myself I mean you could list them and things like that. But when he was, uhm, having me try to reminiscing connect and everything else I could only rely on what was truly mine. And this time, I hope you understand that right. And so to me it was inherently reinforced, it didn't have to be brought to my attention. 

00:48:05
BILL O'HANLON Thank you. 

00:48:05
MICHAEL If I answer that. 

00:48:10
BILL O'HANLON Great answer I when, ah, tell me anywhere close to that and stumble through it. Who a-- also over there. Yeah. 

00:48:15
 This question is for Bill. Just kind of structurally how do you set up the, the therapeutic relationship letting, you know, the individual know how you're gonna help them along in very few sessions, do you use homework, do you explain when the person comes in, you know, research has shown that you've already making progress just by being here. I mean do you do that kind of thing, do you, do you give the homework-- I mean how would you structure and explain to the client that you only have a few precious sessions because it maybe it's EAP or you know, who knows what it is. 

00:48:50
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, I mean if it's really and knows your strength I say we have of couple sessions that's really trying to get to the heart of bit here and, you know, it-- was I'm doing helpful and if its not you need to let me know as we go on to the different direction but I-- it's-- there's no formula like that for me it's such an individual conversation and that's you know, I used to when I've first started I was trained as a marriage and family therapist systemic and I was trained in NLP and strategic therapy and always thought I had to figure it out and be clever and have a structure like that. And, boy, there was a lot of pressure on me that get it right, you know, I felt like-- I feel like Michael trying to get it right on. And, you know, I, I just, you know, sometimes I think I would get it right and sometimes I wouldn't but I was really stressed about it. And when I got to this approach it's like I don't need to get it right he just needs to get it right. And I need to ask the right questions so he starts to get it right. And, you, you know, when I get-- you know, I could tell sometimes when I was asking the right question or saying the right thing and sometimes I wasn't, it was like, yeah, that's not that helpful. He's kind of give the nonverbal and the verbal in front, that's the to have, oh, that's kind, oh, that's kind, yeah, that's helpful. 

00:49:55
MICHAEL And, uhm, one thing that helped too than you could tell, uhm, I was probably drifting into different thoughts. Your stories help-- uhm, that there were times that I didn't want to get too deep and personal and you were like hardened about it which help me stay focus in what we were doing. 

00:50:10
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:50:10
MICHAEL Cuz they're subject I could have easily working down on so... 

00:50:15
BILL O'HANLON I wanted to help you distract yourself and - 

00:50:15
MICHAEL Yeah, actually. 

00:50:15
BILL O'HANLON - not actually get in touch with your feelings that was good. 

00:50:25
 So it seem like you kind to help - 

00:50:25
BILL O'HANLON It's your strength? 

00:50:25
BILL O'HANLON So it seems like you kind a help him come up with his own homework but you didn't call it homework. 

00:50:25
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, well I did-- I did tell him to keep his Dad around and then we are, are wanted to and then he figured out maybe put in the recurring events in the calendar because you do tend to forget. 

00:50:35
MICHAEL Yes. 

00:50:35
BILL O'HANLON You know, it, it-- are you could I don't know what they would but you could and there's, there's a worry about that and so he came up with his own. Homework assignment I guess he-- you know, I would like-- put it in there, have put it-- you know, I can put it in my calendar and reoccurring-- that was the homework assignment but he came out of a conversation. 

00:50:55
BILL O'HANLON Right. 

00:50:55
BILL O'HANLON I think those kind of homework assignments are way better than, you know, here's my-- it is what need to do I did suggest to keep his father around as a guardian angel and a presence or whatever you know. 

00:51:05
MICHAEL I can say that's, uhm, probably being more useful than my own reoccurring event because it's more anchored to, ah, a heartfelt sense of my concern. Uhm, the recurring events probably gonna become about this, uhm, and that's the anesthetize just like my other list. 

00:51:25
BILL O'HANLON Okay, so do we speak to you? 

00:51:25
BILL O'HANLON Yes , I do. 

00:51:25
BILL O'HANLON Thank you. 

00:51:25
BILL O'HANLON So were having done now-- I wasn't pay attention when the people came up but... 

00:51:30
 Ah, I noticed that after you to fold for success stories from him you said something about you came in this crisis and you were standing tall. And I didn't know if that was deliberate on your part and Michael I'm curious if you noticed that and how you responded to the phrase. 

00:51:45
BILL O'HANLON That I used that phrase standing tall. 

00:51:45
MICHAEL I don't recall the phrase but I'm remember the feeling. 

00:51:50
BILL O'HANLON Thank you. 

00:51:50
BILL O'HANLON He didn't seem to noticed and said I did use it to deliberately, yes. Seem that an appropriate metaphor. 

00:52:00
MICHAEL Uhm, as an anecdotes and said in here another question. Uhm, when you were talking about I keep my father around there's someone to talk to like my own therapist. Uhm, my little daughter she'll often come to me. I'd say often probably happen dozen times or so as company and and said, "Dad I need you to be Mr. Epstein(ph) right now, I mean you need to go your office." 

00:52:25
BILL O'HANLON That's great. 

00:52:25
MICHAEL And she said and I know what ever I tell you stays in here, so Dad can't get mad. 

00:52:30
BILL O'HANLON That's great. Great and the tradition continues. Yeah. There's a legacy to come down. There's a good cheating around, the, the therapist to your daughter cheating around, yeah. That's cool. 

00:52:40
 Bill, sounds you're starting with the-- with the belief that the structure of his character is sound. So, being kind of the father and NLP and that picked up artist so you're using one NLP. Why did you not focus more on skill based actions. 

00:53:00
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, it is-- it's good question. That's a really good question I've had this conversation with other people and with myself I would rather start with the fact that he's already got the skills. And assume that until I'm proven wrong. And so, yeah, that's, that's definitely a direction because some people do not have the skills. And you know, but if he's been married before and he's having dates I'm think his got the skills. So if he-- but then that would be the value of an ongoing relationship because any come back and say you know, I did this things and I'm certainly centered and then when I got to the situation I did not have the-- I just-- they didn't they weren't there for me. You know, and then, I would say, Oh, now we need to do skills, acquisition skill, phonings-- you know go alert, more army, now go to one with this classes get the Neil Strauss books or you know the, the skills are sometimes helpful. I'm writing in novel at the moment and I've had this novel in mind for years and I took it on all my course on how to write a novel and now I know how to write the novel. It-- I'd-- I'm sure I had it within the but it wasn't coming forth. Let's to say that and I've written 36 nonfiction books and they were coming forth easily. I did not have the skill of how to write fiction. And so sometimes skill is really important, sometimes it's not. So, don't tell me just trust my the e-- that I'll have the answer within how to write a novel. I did that for about 10 years in the novel that you've written. 

00:54:25
 Thank you very much. 

00:54:25
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. It's good. Thanks, good question, good observation. 

00:54:30
 Oh, I wanna just, ah, thank you and thank you Michael for your, ah, part in the demonstration and I just gonna play off the human. When he ask you what you were going to do to keep on track, you know, when you left her. I think you should have said or could have said, is there any young available woman who be willing to be my accountability partner? 

00:54:55
BILL O'HANLON Anybody out here willing to keep Michael on the track you know? Yeah, but we can meet them afterwards with the telephone numbers if that's-- if interested. There you go you got, ah. 

00:55:05
MICHAEL We have a lot in common. 

00:55:10
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. I know, I don't know. Not by data therapist but, you know, there's I could be trouble. Oh, it could be trouble. 

00:55:15
MICHAEL That sounds good. 

00:55:15
BILL O'HANLON I been married to a couple and its, nah, nah. It's not all the cracks up to do sometimes.

BILL O'HANLON Sick, sick, sick fellow. Okay. You know, its, its-- that's might not apologizing stands here really sick. Uhm, okay, so sounds like we've had the conversation we want-- I'm its really hard to see whether people at the mike and assume they aren't in-- so I assume there's no more questions. And I really appreciate you're been willing to do this. Thank you. And I appreciate you all being here and also laughing at our jokes at the right times and that was really important for the healing part of it.
