Microtraining Associates, Inc. 888 - 505 - 5576 Email: info@emicrotraining.com Website: www.emicrotraining.com Microtraining Associates presents The Clinical Dilemmas In Marriage Series with Betty Carter, MSW Case Study #1 WHO'S IN THE KITCHEN: Helping Men Move Toward The Center of Family Life 

00:00:00
BETTY CARTER  Kathy and Neil came in following a period of increased fighting. Kathy said the problem began six months ago after they moved in with Neil's mother. When his father died, Neil's mother had gradually become unable to keep up her house and she reluctantly planned to move to a retirement home in Florida. Neil felt that she deserved much better than that, and he was upset that he would not be able to see her regularly. At the same time, Neil and Kathy had not been able to afford adequate housing for themselves. The solution that Neil, Kathy and his mother worked out, a solution which has now become a problem, was for Neil, Kathy, and their children to move into his mother's house. There's plenty of room for all of them, but they share the kitchen. And often, Kathy and her mother-in-law disagree about the cooking. Basically, Kathy feels that Neil is too close to his mother, and she's angry that he always takes his mother side against her. She's also angry that Neil doesn't take a stand with his mother even when she criticizes Kathy's parenting of the kids. What we have here is an example of a classic mother-in-law triangle in which Neil looks like the reasonable, innocent bystander caught between the difficult mother and the all too easily irritated wife. Actually, the central difficulty stands from the fact that men are generally not held responsible to conduct their own relationships, while women are socialized to take charge of the emotional work in the family. So, Neil lays low, trying to avoid emotional conflict and looks to his wife to manage the complex relationship with his mother, with all too predictable results. Throughout this case example, I have chosen to highlight my efforts to help Neil broaden his focus on the problem and assume a more responsible position in his relationships with both his mother and his wife. At this point in the first session, Neil makes it clear that he sees it as Kathy's job to work out some sort of peace treaty with his mother. 

00:03:20
NEIL  I get home, I put in a long day at work, I'm worried about my job, I'm feeling like I'm getting my brains beat in, I'm concerned about losing my job, and I get home and what do I hear but that I have problems with my mother. Well, come on, I mean, eh, you, you chose, you, you were the one who decided that we could be there. I feel that if you can't get along with her in her kitchen, I mean you've gotta you just kinda relax a little. Ah, I'm it's. (crosstalk) 

00:03:55
BETTY CARTER  Neil, you're calling it her kitchen. Uhm, do you think of it is your house too, or still your mom's? 

00:04:05
NEIL Well, I guess, it always has been her house ah, (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. How long, (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
NEIL and I. (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
BETTY CARTER how long has she lived in there? 

00:04:15
NEIL Ah, it's. (crosstalk) 

00:04:15
BETTY CARTER It's that the house you grew up in, isn't it? 

00:04:15
NEIL Yeah, so they, they built that house just before I was born, so it's 40-something years old. 

00:04:20
BETTY CARTER Wow. Do you know anybody else, ah, Neil? Do you have any friends or any relatives or anybody who's having trouble with this real estate market here in New York these days? 

00:04:30
NEIL  Yeah. Well, times are tough and I know people who are in apartments and, ah, wish they had a house ah, and, uhm, or people who are, you know, I can think of a family with three children who are in a tiny house, (crosstalk) 

00:04:50
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:04:50
NEIL and, ah, kinda bursting out at the seams but, uhm, you know, you talk for a, ah, again for that, to the model a house with a picket fence. You're talking, ah, talking a lot of money now, and. (crosstalk) 

00:05:00
BETTY CARTER Of course, do you any other three-generation households, for instance, among your friends? 

00:05:05
NEIL Well, you know, for better or worse, I almost feel like I'm a pioneer in this set-up because... (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm, you are. 

00:05:10
NEIL ...I, I'm aware of other, ah, young couples who are gonna face this issue of, uhm, you know, how, how do you care for your aging parents, and ah, (crosstalk) 

00:05:20
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
NEIL uhm, ah, I felt strongly that I did not want my mother in a retirement home. 

00:05:30
BETTY CARTER As I listen to your talk, I'm not sure what's your take on this issue is. Do you say this as a creative solution? Or sometimes you talk like it's some kind of a failure, or something? 

00:05:40
NEIL Well, one level I, (sighs) I, I guess I wish that we had our own house that was our space, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
BETTY CARTER But I mean what about you, personally? I mean are you into a sort of "man the provider," that kind of thing? 

00:06:00
NEIL Well, I supposed that in the family, it was part of my father's pride that he had provided, you know, he had provided the housing or it was his, sort of his castle. 

00:06:15
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:06:15
NEIL So. (crosstalk) 

00:06:15
BETTY CARTER  So, you did grow up with that idea? 

00:06:20
NEIL Well, yeah, I guess, yeah. Uhm, I am, I mean I, you know, I feel that I, I provide for my family, (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:06:30
NEIL and I, you know, I am the, the primary breadwinner, so, I mean, (laughs) but ah, it's, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:06:40
BETTY CARTER You sound like you're a sort of talking it up to yourself or something, not like you really, not like that you really think that in times like this and in economic situations like this, ah, there aren't too many men that providers around. 

00:06:55
NEIL  Well, ah, the reality is that, that it is tough. And, given a climate where ah, I mean I think my job is secured, but I don't know that my job is secured... (crosstalk) 

00:07:10
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:07:10
NEIL ...so, uhm, so, I, I would hesitate. I, I'm not eager to take on a huge mortgage... (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:07:20
NEIL ...in order to afford a. (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
BETTY CARTER Well, Neil, le, le, let me ask you something. What would it take for you to change that picture you have about your role? What would it take for you to sort of modernize your view of how a family comes to its housing, and how it acquires things and sort of include Kathy in a deal a little bit here or included... (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
NEIL Yeah. 

00:07:45
BETTY CARTER ...solutions like the one you've come up with, like moving in with your mom. 

00:07:50
NEIL Well, uhm, I mean, I supposed, what, what I want is for my family to be happy and, uhm, you know, and to promise trying to get there, ah, (laughing) (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
BETTY CARTER Well, (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
NEIL Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:08:05
BETTY CARTER oh, well, how about wait, wait, wait. How about you being happy? I mean, how about it being okay for you, that by moving in with your mom in this house, it takes care of a lot of her problems and gives you a great house? 

00:08:20
NEIL  Uh hmm, well, yeah, I mean that's, yeah, (laughs) that's, that's reality. But, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
BETTY CARTER But? There's always that, this "but". You really do think it's your job. 

00:08:35
BETTY CARTER Kathy opened the second session by criticizing Neil for leaving her to deal with his mother. 

00:08:45
KATHY Well, I just wish once in a while, you could sit down with your mother and clarify the issues. Uh, you know, I get sick of always having to be the one. I mean I'm always the one to bring it up and discuss it, and you just sit back. I mean why can't you do more? 

00:09:00
NEIL I'm trying but I, I feel like I'm the man in the middle and, and I often wish that you had a little more sympathy for my mother's situation. I, she's, you know, she still hasn't gotten over the death of my father, and, you know, I, I feel you react to things and I wish you would step back and, and cut her a little slack. Ah, that's, that's my feeling about it, I'm. 

00:09:25
BETTY CARTER Neil, let me ask you a little about that. Uhm, how are the people in the family handling it since your dad died? Uh, how are they handling his death? Your, not only your mother and you, but your sister, brother? 

00:09:40
NEIL Well, handling it? I. (crosstalk) 

00:09:45
BETTY CARTER Well, do you talk about, and do these(ph)? 

00:09:45
NEIL  Well, his name comes up in passing, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:09:55
BETTY CARTER Who brings it up? 

00:09:55
NEIL Well, my mother will say, uhm, something like, "Do you remember when dad planted that tree?", or, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:10:05
NEIL that sort of kind of dad, (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:10:11
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:10:11
NEIL ...but, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:10:11
BETTY CARTER So, do you think maybe she's trying to talk about him, or that she'd sort of like to get some more conversation going about him, or reminisces, reminiscences? 

00:10:20
NEIL Well, maybe. Ah, I suppose that, I'm aware that it's, it's still a very painful subject. 

00:10:30
BETTY CARTER  Uh-huh. 

00:10:35
NEIL And, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
BETTY CARTER So it's for you, for your mom? 

00:10:40
NEIL Yeah. Well, I, I feel a lot of sadness. (crosstalk) 

00:10:45
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:10:45
NEIL I, I, I miss my father. 

00:10:45
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:10:45
NEIL Uhm. 

00:10:45
BETTY CARTER Are you close to him? 

00:10:45
NEIL  Yeah. Yeah, I'd say we were close. 

00:10:50
BETTY CARTER Hmm. 

00:10:50
NEIL Ah, we didn't talk so much but it was, uhm, I would help him ah, with projects around the house, or gardening, that kind of stuff, and, ah, it was pretty easy and, ah, you know, we would have the... (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:11:05
NEIL  and we had a bond, and... (crosstalk) 

00:11:10
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:11:10
NEIL ah, and, yeah, and I guess, that's what I miss. It's just... (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:11:15
NEIL ...that sort of close feeling I, I have. (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm, some sort of camaraderie there, huh? 

00:11:20
NEIL Yeah, yeah. 

00:11:20
BETTY CARTER And you and your mom don't talk about that? I mean you don't talk about that with your mom? That would be hard? 

00:11:30
NEIL Well, I, I guess, there's a lot of, yeah, just a feeling that there's a lot of pain there that uhm, we've, that would be hard to bring up, ah, I don't know. (crosstalk) 

00:11:45
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. Well, do you and your mom spend time together? I mean now you're actually living together, you know. Do you spend any time, just the two of you? 

00:11:50
NEIL (sighs) Well, no. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:11:55
BETTY CARTER  Hmm. 

00:12:00
NEIL it's usually, uhm, you know, that the kids are around or... (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:12:05
NEIL ...uhm, or Kathy's, were all in the kitchen or something, but uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. Uh hmm. But not you and your mom with any private time? 

00:12:15
NEIL No. 

00:12:15
BETTY CARTER Neil, who's closest to your mother? 

00:12:20
NEIL I suppose I am. 

00:12:20
BETTY CARTER  Uh-huh. Well, you are her baby, after all. (laughs) 

00:12:25
NEIL  Uhm. 

00:12:30
BETTY CARTER You know, ah, and we never get too old for that, you know. I guess the youngest has a special place in a mother's heart. Does that bother you, Kathy? You seem to have some thoughts about that, Neil's closeness to his mother. 

00:12:45
KATHY Well, I mean, you know, I guess it does sort of bother me a little bit. So, ah, you know, I guess maybe there's some jealousy of his being close, though I don't think that's all of it. I think if he was close and yet, you know, dealt with her, it's like he, he has just this nice relationship with her and I'm left... (crosstalk) 

00:13:05
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:13:05
KATHY ...with dealing with all of the problems. 

00:13:05
BETTY CARTER  Uh hmm. So you do some of his job... (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
KATHY Yeah. 

00:13:10
BETTY CARTER ...with his mother, (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
KATHY I feel... (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
BETTY CARTER is that it?- (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
KATHY ...I get to do a lot of his job... (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh, (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
KATHY ...with his mother. 

00:13:15
BETTY CARTER uh-huh. Do you think that you've got his family as part of your wedding present? 

00:13:20
KATHY Oh, no question, no question. I got his family. 

00:13:25
BETTY CARTER But you seem to have, maybe, some talent for it, do you? 

00:13:25
KATHY  Well. 

00:13:30
BETTY CARTER (laughing) Does he always enlist you, or do you volunteer sometimes? 

00:13:35
KATHY Oh, I volunteer. I mean I like his mother and I'm, when I see that she's upset I care about her and I, sometimes I think I'm really closer to her than he is. 

00:13:45
BETTY CARTER Well, probably you talk? 

00:13:45
KATHY Yes. 

00:13:45
BETTY CARTER Do you talk together? 

00:13:45
KATHY Yes, yes, that's right. We talk. 

00:13:45
BETTY CARTER  Neil says he doesn't talk very much with her. (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
KATHY No. 

00:13:50
BETTY CARTER He, he feels very warmly toward her, but he doesn't talk with her very much. 

00:13:55
KATHY Yes. 

00:13:55
BETTY CARTER You, you and she talk? 

00:13:55
KATHY Yes, uh hmm. 

00:13:55
BETTY CARTER And so how about your relationship with your own mother? Do you have a good relationship with her? 

00:14:00
KATHY Hmm, oh yeah. My, I would say my relationship with my mother is good. (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
KATHY Uh hmm. 

00:14:05
BETTY CARTER And you talk with her and. (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
KATHY Oh yeah. My mother is a real talker and we, you know, we'll, we'll spend an afternoon just, you know, talking, taking a walk maybe. 

00:14:15
BETTY CARTER So somehow, whether it's okay for a close mother-daughter relationship, but mothers and sons shouldn't be so close? How does that work? 

00:14:25
KATHY Well, ah, I guess a little bit it's like, yeah, you know, it's all right to have another girlfriend, but I wouldn't want him to have a, you know, it's all right for me to have a girlfriend, but I wouldn't want him to have one. 

00:14:35
BETTY CARTER So isn't that funny? Let me ask you something. How do you get along with your father? 

00:14:40
KATHY  Well, my father and I, you know, we have a nice relationship, a little bit distant, he, he usually work. 

00:14:50
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:14:50
KATHY But we're close. (crosstalk) 

00:14:50
BETTY CARTER But it's a nice relationship? (crosstalk) 

00:14:50
KATHY Uh hmm. 

00:14:50
BETTY CARTER Do you think of him as your boyfriend? 

00:14:55
KATHY No, no, but. (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
BETTY CARTER So how come if Neil has a close relationship with his mother, it, it's sort of like a girlfriend? (crosstalk) 

00:15:05
KATHY True. (crosstalk) 

00:15:05
BETTY CARTER It's funny, isn't it, don't... (crosstalk) 

00:15:05
KATHY Yes, (crosstalk) 

00:15:05
BETTY CARTER ...you think? 

00:15:05
KATHY yeah, yeah, that's true. That's true because if a. (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
BETTY CARTER 'Coz a lot of people take a different view of it, somehow, of, of mothers and sons, like it's not okay for them to have a close relationship. 

00:15:20
KATHY Hmm. That's true. I guess if anything, I would want a close relationship with my father and I wouldn't want Neil to be threatened by that. 

00:15:25
BETTY CARTER  Okay. 

00:15:30
KATHY Right. 

00:15:30
BETTY CARTER Good. Neil, what do you think it is that holds you back from, from spending some more time with your mom and from talking with her, maybe talking about your dad? 

00:15:45
[sil.] 

00:15:45
NEIL  Uhm. 

00:15:50
BETTY CARTER I know "busy". 

00:15:50
NEIL Right. 

00:15:50
BETTY CARTER Yeah. I mean, after we get past "busy". 

00:15:55
NEIL Yes, uhm, well, we all have painful feelings. I, I suppose ah, (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:16:00
NEIL  maybe we take a walk and ah, (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:16:05
NEIL you know, and talk in that kind of circumstance, the kind that's, ah, somewhat, it's a little less intense but. (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
BETTY CARTER Well, you know, this may come as a surprise to you but, you know, most of the time, people don't die of painful feelings, you know. 

00:16:25
NEIL True, (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
BETTY CARTER I, (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
NEIL true. 

00:16:25
BETTY CARTER I, I know we all do try to avoid them but, you know, they just get worse. I mean, holding them in and everything, I guess, in the end, makes them worse. Do you think uhm, I mean, what would be the worst thing that will happen? You might cry? Would, would that be the worst thing that will happen? 

00:16:45
NEIL Well, when you put it that way, yeah. I mean, that's. (crosstalk) 

00:16:50
BETTY CARTER And maybe she might cry too, (crosstalk) 

00:16:50
NEIL Yeah. 

00:16:50
BETTY CARTER so the two of you might cry together? 

00:16:50
NEIL Well, there is a lot of sadness there. 

00:16:55
BETTY CARTER Yeah. Would that be so terrible? 

00:16:55
NEIL No. Uhm, no. I don't suppose it would. 

00:17:00
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. It might be, it might really be quite worthwhile for you to, to think about that, Neil, about spending a little time with her and may, maybe somehow getting around to talk in some about your dad. 

00:17:15
NEIL Yeah. 

00:17:15
BETTY CARTER I think it's, I think it's getting in the way. 

00:17:20
NEIL Yeah, I, I, I think you're right. Uhm, and I think if I made the gesture, that my mother would, well, would welcome it. 

00:17:30
BETTY CARTER  I, Yeah. I, I wouldn't be surprised. (crosstalk) 

00:17:35
NEIL Yeah. 

00:17:35
BETTY CARTER I, I think she would to. 

00:17:35
NEIL Uh hmm. 

00:17:35
BETTY CARTER  Neil has spent more time with his mother, sitting up to talk with her about his father and occasionally taking her to lunch, just the two of them. He also talked to his mother about some of the difficulties with all of them living together, and he told her that he and Kathy are the ones who will make decisions about their kids. 

00:18:00
Several Months Later 

00:18:00
BETTY CARTER  Kathy, how come you're not angry anymore at Neil, his spending so much time with his mother? 

00:18:05
KATHY  Well, I, I'm not angry. I guess we're just a little less angry altogether. At, at first, when he was spending more time with his mother, it was difficult. (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:18:20
KATHY I felt sort of left out and ah, (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:18:20
KATHY  she was really happy. And, and so I did feel a little left out. But... (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
BETTY CARTER Yeah. 

00:18:30
KATHY ...once I got past that, once I sat with that, you know, as you had asked me to, and, uhm, and once I got past that, I can really see the improvement. 

00:18:35
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:18:35
KATHY  Ah, his mother was clearly much happier. I think some of her irritability and her, you know, just her, but she was taking out on me, or just her unhappiness... (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:18:50
KATHY ...was really falling all on me and she's happier so there's less, you know, irritability in general. And also Neil is there more now. (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:19:00
KATHY When she is irritable, (crosstalk) 

00:19:00
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:19:00
KATHY he takes it up more. 

00:19:00
BETTY CARTER  Well, listen. Now that things are calming down quite a bit, (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
KATHY Uh-huh. 

00:19:05
BETTY CARTER uhm, what do you think are the pluses in this situation now? How, how do you add up the pluses of this whole situation of your living arrangement? 

00:19:15
KATHY We're gonna be, oh, well, there are a lot of pluses when we're not, you know. When things are calm it's, it's nice and that, you know, I do work in the home and my mother-in-law is there for the kids, not, I mean, you know, our kids don't need things like small kids anymore, but if something were to come up and they had a question, or she's there. (crosstalk) 

00:19:40
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:19:40
KATHY And, and in terms of, of dinner and all, we are able to cooperate a little bit more. 

00:19:45
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:19:45
KATHY Uhm, yeah, I would say things are much better. In fact, I'm even thinking about looking for a job at a magazine or a newspaper, something like that... (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
BETTY CARTER Uh hmm. 

00:19:55
KATHY ...where I can... (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
NEIL Well, (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
KATHY ...be with her. 

00:19:55
NEIL really? I, I. (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
KATHY Well, yeah. 

00:20:00
NEIL Well, I, I, (crosstalk) 

00:20:00
KATHY Is. (crosstalk) 

00:20:00
NEIL thought you were, I thought you were happy staying at home and having, being around when ah, (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
KATHY Well, uhm, I kinda had to be. I mean, I, I guess I lied in a way but, you know, it seemed like everybody needed me. So I thought about, you know, how I could have a career and satisfy everybody else's needs. You didn't ask. (crosstalk) 

00:20:20
BETTY CARTER You don't know this, Neil? You didn't know that Kathy really would have preferred to work outside? 

00:20:25
NEIL  Ah, hmm, you learn something everyday. I guess I didn't know. 

00:20:30
BETTY CARTER Come to therapy and find out about your life, huh? 

00:20:35
NEIL Yeah, yeah. 

00:20:35
KATHY Yeah, yeah. Well, you know I think it would be, you know our children aren't so small now and now that your mother, you know, everything seems calmer. I just feel as though now that you're taking up some of the slack gives me a little more freedom. In fact, we're thinking about ah, Neil and I have talked about remodeling the kitchen. 

00:20:55
BETTY CARTER Oh really? 

00:20:55
KATHY Yeah. 

00:20:55
BETTY CARTER Well, now, there's a big step. 

00:20:55
KATHY Yeah, that's a big step. 

00:20:55
NEIL  Yeah, well, we, we've talked it over with my mother and she's agreed. Uhm, I suppose she has some reservations, but... (crosstalk) 

00:21:05
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:21:05
NEIL  I, I, yeah, but uhm, she's, she's agreed to go along, uhm, and, yeah, I, I think it will be, I think it'll be good. 

00:21:20
KATHY Well, I think that she's in, she's willing but I think she has some sadness about it. I don't think she's. (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. Well, that's understandable, (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
KATHY Uh hmm. 

00:21:25
BETTY CARTER  you know, uhm, really for her, I guess, it's passing the baton, or, pa, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
KATHY Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
BETTY CARTER passing the torch to the next... (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
KATHY Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
BETTY CARTER  generation that's, (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
KATHY Uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
BETTY CARTER it's always... (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
KATHY It's a loss. (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
BETTY CARTER ...a big step. It's a loss for her. 

00:21:40
KATHY Uh hmm. 

00:21:40
BETTY CARTER Uhm, on the other hand, well, let me, let me ask you about something, both of you. What would you think about creating some kind of a little, I don't know, ritual or making some kind of a, of a deal out of it. You know, instead of just well, "Mom's lost her kitchen now and she's over the hill." Uhm, what would you think about some kind of a little ceremony of some kind? I don't know, or maybe a, a special dinner, or a special program in the future where mom cook, grandma cooks on the certain night and does her special dishes and teaches, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:22:20
KATHY Uh hmm. 

00:22:20
BETTY CARTER to you guys and teaches them to the... (crosstalk) 

00:22:20
KATHY Uhm, that would be nice. 

00:22:20
BETTY CARTER ...kids. I mean how could you see that working out? Could you think of how that could be? 

00:22:25
NEIL  Yeah, that's intriguing. I, uhm, no, I don't know if we have a ah, sort of a uhm, a wine and cheese thing, or something, you know, something, (crosstalk) 

00:22:40
BETTY CARTER Well, that's great. 

00:22:40
NEIL something, or, or, or maybe. (crosstalk) 

00:22:40
BETTY CARTER Something very special, in... (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
NEIL Right, (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
BETTY CARTER ...other words. 

00:22:45
NEIL right, or, uhm, or let's have a wonderful uhm, French cuisine, you know, something as, I mean something that's ah, a little special. 

00:22:55
BETTY CARTER Maybe everybody could say something. You know, ah, I don't know, I guess, to sort of celebrate what she's contributed in those 40 years. I mean to, to have her feel that it was valued, you know, and that it's not just that she's finished and, but that it's being carried on in some way. And you know, Neil, I think, ah, in some kind of a toast, or whatever little speech, or whatever you might give at, at the ceremonial meal, you know, it would be awfully good if you could bring your dad into it. It was his house, (crosstalk) 

00:23:25
NEIL Yeah, yes, (crosstalk) 

00:23:25
BETTY CARTER too, wasn't it? 

00:23:30
NEIL Yes, yes. Uhm, yeah, in a way he made it all possible, or whatever, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
BETTY CARTER Uh-huh. 

00:23:35
NEIL yeah, that's it. That's a good thought. I, I like that.
