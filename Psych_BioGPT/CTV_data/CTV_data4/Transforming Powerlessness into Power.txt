Transforming Powerlessness into Power with Vanessa Jackson, LCSW 

00:00:00
"I want you to show them the difference between what they think you are and what you can be." - Ernest Gaines 

00:00:40
VANESSA JACKSON I came to work with ideas of power in about 1988, when I was a graduate student and I had an opportunity to take a class with Elaine Pinderhughes, who works around power theory. What was amazing about this class is that it really was a two-weekend long conversation around power that talked a lot about theory, but what has stayed with me for almost 25 years are two really basic questions. What she asked us, in which we process as a group, was when have you felt powerful and when have you felt powerless? As I began to sort of process those questions with the group and through my own story, I noticed that one thing happened. I was able to tell pieces of my story that I never talked about before, especially in a racially mixed group. But I also was able to hear other people's stories because I could identify in ways that I'd never before, with both their experiences of being powerful and their experiences of being powerless. So that has really been a consistent thread through my work, but I think the way that I really brought it home for myself is through a personal story. What happened was I had a clinical depression in the aftermath, or in the process, of divorcing and I'm a person who was not prone to depression and so I sort of got separated from myself. As I began to look at my journey back to feeling I had power again over my life and my life choices, I tracked it and mapped it and then as I came back. I tell people oftentimes, what appears to be a very bad thing can really be a very good thing because I think it made me a better therapist, because I began to feel, in a very profound way, these power issues. What I ended up doing, then, is talking a lot with my clients about power and their lives. Then there was a third thing that happened, third layer of it is I, because I had this clinical depression, was invited to do a research project on African-American psychiatric history from a Consumer/Survivor/Ex-Patient perspective. I think that one was really important for me because I really began to understand, as I'm digging around in records and looking at log books from the 1800's around these experiences, that the power abuses that were inherent in the mental health field. That, in fact, then led to a crisis in that I really wondered if it was possible for me to be a therapist, when the profession was grounded in so much abuse of power. About that time, I met Michael White and Cheryl White and David Denborough with the Dulwich Center and this sort of very natural process of how one tells stories fit for me. It fit culturally for me. I'm a storyteller, I think, really by nature, and so I suddenly had a new language to go back into therapy with. It was this blending of both narrative practice, storytelling practice, grounded in a very clear understanding and analysis of power. It was my job as the therapist to invite client into the process of analyzing power in their own lives. That background sort of shapes what comes out of a very personal story. It's a very sort of fluid story and, quite frankly, it's still very much evolving. 

00:04:15
Power 1. The ability to do something or act in a particular way. 2. The capacity to influence the behavior of others, the emotions or course of events. 3. A right or authority given or delegated to a person or body- political authority or control. 4. Physical strength or force. 

00:04:20

00:04:25
VANESSA JACKSON I think there's lots of definitions of power out there, but two of them stand out for me. One sort of brings in how Elaine Pinderhughes thinks about it, which is sort of a combined process of, I see power as the ability to act in your preferred manner in your environment and that includes having the resources and the awareness to act in that, own your environment. It's about my ability to influence others in my relationships with them. And then it's the other piece of it. That sense of personal mastery. 

00:04:55
The most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed. Steven Biko

00:05:00
VANESSA JACKSON There's another person that has really influenced my work, which is Starhawk, who is an activist. She talks about "power over", which is the kind of power that we're most familiar with, oftentimes in its most abusive form. But there's actually a kind version of power over, which is what happens in loving parental relationships, in relationships with teachers and students, that people in fact do have power, but they use it in many ways in the service and with intentionality and in caring with the other person. But they, in fact, do hold more power and it's clear to everybody. There's "power with", which is my ability to sort of, because of who I am and how I show up to influence people and also to link with people and be in alliance and solidarity and make change happen from that sort of shared, joint perspective. And then the final one, which is the one that I think is the most powerful, is the place I think can lift people most quickly and that's "power from within", and that can be a situation where you make a decision about how you're going to experience something. You can change the story so you can be in really, really oppressive conditions and we hear people who have been survivors of all kinds of abuse, people who've been incarcerated, who will tell the story that anyone would look at their situation and see it as a degrading, humbling, terrified situation and, while they acknowledge that those factors were happening, what they are able to do is somehow transcend that sort of external world and not let it touch what, I don't think as therapists we talk about very often, but their soul. And so it's ability that, no matter what's going on outside of me, that I've got a sort of stable story about my worth and value and my ability to make decisions, even if I only... There's a really cute thing going around Facebook right now which does have some useful aspects and it's a little, one of my clients sent it to me because she and I talk endlessly about power, and it says at any point I have the power to say, "This is not how the story is going to end". I think that's really one of those, that's a really concrete way of thinking about this power from within, is I can make a decision about how I perceive, I choose to perceive this situation. That sort of mixed way of thinking about both the power over, which also pays attention to the external environment and the resources. That power with an alliance, with my ability to influence people and for me, most importantly is this power from within, which is my own sense of personal mastery of my emotions, of my story.

Power and Counseling 

00:07:50
[sil.] 

00:07:55
VANESSA JACKSON You know, some of the ways I think we talk about power and especially making it really clear is, I think, power is always around and in our lives, but we often aren't given the language to describe it, define it, and I think it's going to be really important to sort of be able to name it, analyze it and then strategize. And so you've got to know what you're looking at, so oftentimes a way that what I might call a "power wound", which is an experience and it's an aftermath that creates a constriction or an impairment of how one gets to operate in their sense of agency power, ability to make change on all those three levels that we've talked about; power over, power with and power from within. So when you've got that kind of impairment, the way it oftentimes shows up is what we might more traditionally call depression. It might show up in ways that we would traditionally think of as post-traumatic stress disorder. Depending on what was the nature of the wounding, the type of wounding, if it's sexual abuse, physical abuse, financial abuse, it shows up a little differently, but what you see in people is oftentimes anxiety, depression, anger, depending again on how people's own story intersects with that wound. So some of the things that we would clinically see and the way that... what's really important for me in how I work with people, is while I hold an understanding of those labels of depression and anxiety and trauma, is that I really always try to talk about it as a fluid, moving thing. Something they're experiencing this moment, because I want to begin to direct them toward it can be different, so I'm always trying to hold that. So if I see somebody with, who comes in and they're really depressed, which it oftentimes are people that I see in my practice are dealing with some degree of depression. There was one woman who didn't want to own depression and I'm like, "Cool, let's not own depression." I said, "How about, can we call it like a really intense sadness?" And she was fine with intense sadness, but then there was reasons why she was sad. As we begin to talk about whether they're engaging as depression and then we're going to give you some medication. We're going to do this and we're going to do some change your thinking about it. My invitation for her was, we need to understand where this is coming from, it didn't come from anywhere and even if it's biochemical, there's something that's affecting that and I think it's really important for you to understand the story of this depression, this anxiety, this trauma reaction, this anger, because every emotion has a story behind it. Part of my job is sitting with the person to unpack that story and that can sometimes happen very quickly and sometimes it takes a long time to unpack the story. What I'm looking for are things like the depression, things I identify, hyper-vigilance, defensiveness that come from the wound and then we begin to name it, because I think what's core to looking at healing power wounds is the ability to, again, to name it. You've got to know, you can't heal what you conceal or that you don't understand. 

00:11:10
Healing Questions 

00:11:15
[sil.] 

00:11:15
Guiding Principles for Using Healing Questions - Belief that ALL wounds can be healed - The clinician must develop a vision of healing - Naming and acknowledging the wound 

00:11:15
- The creation of "safe enough space" - Create a container to hold and protect individuals - The identification of resiliency skills and unwounded spaces in the self/community 

00:11:30
VANESSA JACKSON The first question is: What happened to you? The second question is: How does what happened to you affect you now? And then the third question is: What do you need to heal? And that third question I always see as a two-part question. Because it is one is, it's sort of like when you get hurt and your mom is like, you know, you're being asked sort of like what happened to you. Like, what would make it better, baby? And so it's what would allow for healing to occur and what is still wounded, is one part of that question. So it's really what needs to be brought to bear to facilitate healing and what would healing look like, what's left to heal. The how it's affecting you is that it, one, it sort of presumes that it probably does have an, so you wouldn't be surprised that there was a continuing impact. And so, it normalizes the fact that something may have happened in the past is having a continued impact on my life right now and for me to again figure out what that is. This happened to me as a child. How does it show up in my life now? It sort of also presumes, sort of why do you think it's showing up now? Because that can say, well, you know, someone keeps leaning on that pain button or something or it wasn't fully healed. But it makes me begin to analyze, automatically begin to analyze my life. And then, what do I need to heal is it says like, what's the nature of the wound today? Is it sort of half healed, is it you know, just as raw and red as it was from day one. But also then begins to say, what would I need to bring to bear? Do I need to clean it off with a little alcohol? Do I need a band-aid? Do I need someone to get their finger out of the wound? And so it makes me again, begin to analyze and strategize. So those three questions which seem super, super simple are really three very powerful questions that shape the healing process and I think gives power back to the person to be a more active participant in their healing, because those aren't answers I can have as a therapist. Those are answers that have to be brought forth from the individual, which automatically makes them an equal partner in the process as I see it. As I begin to also do some presentation around these questions, I began to talk with a colleague of mine, Makungu Akinyela, who was a minister as well, and he says, you know, you ask these questions, you know, there's a place in the African-American, in the black church tradition of testimony and he says and you hear people talk about how they made it through and that's such a critical part. And I remember being at family, sort of, back-road country Mississippi churches where people were giving testimony, almost to the point of confessing crimes sometimes. But in telling their stories in this public setting, with people who love them in the presence their God, is that people found healing. So he says, "I really feel like there's a need for this question about how people made it through." So we begin to talk about how in spite of this wounding and even in spite of its current impact in your life, how have you been able to triumph? How have you been able to make it through? And what I think that question does, is it anchors people in a remembering and a reminding that in spite of what's gone on, is that there are places that either have been unwounded or places that have, they've been able to sustain and protect. I think that that nurtures hope. So we're going to come back and talk about hope a little bit more. You can have bad things happen to you. You could sort of recover but you're not really well until you have found some gift for you in it.

Power Spark 

00:15:35

00:15:35
"I want you to show them the difference between what they think you are and what you can be." - Ernest Gaines 

00:15:35
VANESSA JACKSON One of the things I listen to in my client's story of their wounding and their power wounds are what I call their power spark. Like there's something, no matter what's going on, there's some little bitty piece that's in there that's sort of resisting and saying I will not be wounded. I will not be broken. This gift, what's the gift for you in the wound? It's happened, you can't change it but did you get anything for yourself out of it? Can you do something better? People grow up in alcoholic homes, you know. Yeah, you're hyper-vigilant. Yeah, you know, you're always caretaking. There's some lovely aspects of that if you don't let it get out of hand. If you can find some meaning in this, I think, there's a certain power in restorative impact there. 

00:16:30
[music] 

00:16:30
Experiencing Power Think back to a time in your life (this can be your earliest or most significant memory) when you felt powerless. What was the situation? What did you learn from that experience? Think back to a time in your life when you felt powerful? What was that situation? What did you learn from the experience? 

00:16:40
VANESSA JACKSON What are the external forces that create or maintain the wound? And again, all of these questions, what happened to you, how does what happened to you affect you now, how have you triumphed, like how in spite of the wound, how have you been able to triumph, what are the external factors that create or maintain the wound? Those are what I call the naming questions. The sort of the resistance in healing questions are what needs to heal? What do I need to bring to bear? What's still hurt? What's the gift I receive from this experience? Then, what's the gift that I give back to my community? So when I think about that sort of journey... And I used to sort of give people a hand-out of those questions when we started the therapy. I want you to understand, it's no mystery. This is how I'm going to frame your process. These are the questions that I'm thinking about. These are questions I invite you to think about. And what people kept doing is trying to write out answers to them as an intake form and I would tell them that, you know, really, this is something that's a process. These questions are going to change. You oftentimes, it's rare to come in with just one wound and so people have multiple wounding stories happening and we've got to sort of track the different stories. The questions are intended, in fact, to operate in a spiral because in the outer side when you really don't know what's going on and you start to come into knowing about what's going on and you start asking and analyzing. The whole goal is to get back to your center, to get back to your peace, to get back to wellness. One of the things that I think, in a little bit with my clients because they're like they're glad to talk about power, tired of talking about power, I think sometimes, but they'll come in and say, "You know Vanessa, something happened and I stepped out of my power." And our thing is, how do you get back in your power? It's okay. It's going to happen but our goal is always to get back into your power. Like on the other end of power wounding, the language that I'm thinking about with that now is living full-power. When I ask people oftentimes, like what's your vision for change? It's like, well, to live full-power. Well, what would that look like for you? Because what it looks like for you might be different than for me, but everybody's got to have their own vision. If you could, were living without restrictions with the ability to move in your life the way that made sense to you, what would that look like for you? 

00:19:10
"So, if our work is to evoke power-from-within, we must clearly envision the conditions that would allow that power to come forth, we must identify what blocks it, and create the conditions that foster empowerment. Given a world based on power-over, we must remake the world." - Starhawk 

00:19:15
[sil.] 

00:19:15
VANESSA JACKSON I think this is a good time to bring Alyssa into the room and I think, with our work together, we're going to show you about this journey from powerlessness to power and how she figured out what her wounds were and how she is currently working to transform those wounds into a place of powerful living. 

00:19:40
[sil.] 

00:19:40
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, well, Alyssa, welcome back. I'm glad that you are here today and I know this is our second session and want to check in and see how last session was for you. 

00:19:55
ALYSSA Well, it was okay, you know, it was different because I'm not used to talking about my feelings. 

00:20:00
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:20:00
ALYSSA Not to people. You know, strangers, no disrespect to you, but you know. So that was different, but it felt good because I got so much stuff out that I'd kind of been holding on to. 

00:20:15
VANESSA JACKSON I'm glad. I really appreciate that. 

00:20:15
ALYSSA That made me feel lighter. 

00:20:20
VANESSA JACKSON Lighter? 

00:20:20
ALYSSA Yeah, I felt lighter when I left. 

00:20:20
VANESSA JACKSON What do you think that was about? What let that shift happen? 

00:20:25
ALYSSA Well, it was just, I think, being able to talk about what was bothering me and not being judged, because a lot of times my family, I talk to them and, you know, they always have an opinion about what I am and am not doing. 

00:20:40
VANESSA JACKSON And then of course the court part. 

00:20:45
ALYSSA Yeah. Yeah. That doesn't work for me because I don't feel in control. 

00:20:50
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah and that's one of the things I really want to talk about. I really appreciate you showing up and sharing with me like you did last time, because... 

00:20:55
ALYSSA But is this going to be long? Because last time it took a long time and I do have a hair appointment. 

00:21:00
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. No, we're going to stay, we got about 15 minutes. but I'll make sure we start right on time... 

00:21:05
ALYSSA Okay. 

00:21:05
VANESSA JACKSON ...and get you out, because I think getting on with your life is a good way of living as well. 

00:21:10
ALYSSA Okay. 

00:21:15
VANESSA JACKSON So if you start to feel like it's going a little, sort of...just check in with me again, okay? 

00:21:15
ALYSSA All right. 

00:21:20
VANESSA JACKSON I like the fact that you check in and say that you got some needs and you're willing to say what they are. That's part of our partnership and that's one of the things that we talked about last week, I wanted to make sure that's really important is that, one is I work for you, even though you're here not fully of your own choosing, but we're creating this together so it has got to work for you. 

00:21:35
ALYSSA Okay. All right. 

00:21:40
VANESSA JACKSON One of the things that we talked about last time was sort of how I think about therapy and the time I spend with you and it really is me walking a journey with you around those healing questions. You know, you had some things happening in your life and your son's life and it's our work together to understand them and to create ways for you to feel back, like in your own power. 

00:22:00
ALYSSA Okay. 

00:22:05
VANESSA JACKSON Because you said with the family, with the courts, there's a lot of ways that your power is getting messed with. 

00:22:10
ALYSSA Yeah. 

00:22:10
VANESSA JACKSON Does that fit for you? 

00:22:10
ALYSSA Yeah. 

00:22:10
VANESSA JACKSON So is there any place you'd like to start today? Is there anything going on that you want to make sure that we talk about before our time is up? 

00:22:20
ALYSSA Well, there are two things that are really pressing. Jason is very resentful of what's going on and, unfortunately, I'm the object of that resentment, because he doesn't, you know... His father is around but, you know, he doesn't say all of that stuff that he says he's feeling or hurt to him and it all comes on me. I just, I feel really bad because I love him and he just can be very mean toward me and that's hurtful. 

00:22:50
VANESSA JACKSON Can you tell me a little bit about the things that he's saying and how that... When you say hurtful, immediately the word that comes to mind for me is wounded by this. This your child. 

00:23:00
ALYSSA Yes. Yeah. I mean, you know, I give him everything. I work and live for him and he just says, you know, it's my fault that he doesn't have his dad around and that I cooperated with the court. Well,I don't have a choice. I'm not going to let them send me to jail. So, it's that kind of, you know, statements when I'm trying to act in his best interest and he doesn't get that. 

00:23:30
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. How does the conversation tend to come up? Does he initiate it? Do you initiate it, or is it him just ranting? 

00:23:35
ALYSSA It's not a conversation. 

00:23:35
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. Okay. Tell me . 

00:23:35
ALYSSA It's not a conversation, you know. You know how teenagers are. I don't know if you have children or not, but he just gets pissed off and just starts yelling and screaming at me about what's happening in his life and he don't want to take any responsibility. 

00:23:55
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. You know what Alyssa? Can I offer you a little way of maybe thinking about this, because I know when a teenager is coming full on at you and they're ranting, it's really hard to see where they're scared. Because he probably doesn't sound scared at that moment, but sometimes you know how you notice how powerless you feel, having to be places? That he probably feels the same, unfortunately it doesn't look that way. You know, because he's being angry and dismissive of you. Now here's the thing, you still have to hold the fact that this doesn't feel good and you got to take care of you, so that you can hear him. So what we want to do a little bit today is talk about how you take care of you when that's going on, because it's hurtful. 

00:24:40
ALYSSA Okay. 

00:24:40
VANESSA JACKSON So, if we can take care of the part of you that feels wounded by his lack of gratitude. Is there some other stuff and just his anger? Then we could talk about how you then hold your power. It's really not about taking care of him. It's you holding your power while he's having his moment, but not letting it rock your world. 

00:25:05
ALYSSA Yeah, it's just unappreciative and, you know, that's been all my life that I've felt unappreciated by my siblings and my mom and dad. So that is like walking in that all over again. 

00:25:20
VANESSA JACKSON You know, I like that you notice that. That it hits an old wound, so when he comes up it's like having a little scab on something that was already still tender and someone knocks the scab off. So here you got the wound already, this power wound from your family. Suddenly, this child that you gave birth to, this teenager, is all up on your wound. Okay. So it's like a double hit. I want to sort of explain that to you because that's why it hurts so much. That's why it's hard to get your footing. Do you ever feel like "Why can't I get my, this is my kid, I can't get my footing around this conversation because it hits that other thing"? I like to keep the spiral around because I think the problem that you come in with is like starting here and our job is to walk around this loop until you get here to the center of your power. What you just explained to me is there's at least two loops. The loop of your son and his problems that become your problems. And then the loop of your family and so you might've done some work around it, but when he starts his stuff it's almost like you go back to square one with them. Does that make sense? 

00:26:30
ALYSSA Yes, it does. 

00:26:30
VANESSA JACKSON The reason I want to point that out is that the emotion that comes up with it is really so much more intense. You think like, sometimes, why am I tripping? 

00:26:40
ALYSSA Well, I'm really just sad because it kind of reminds me about, almost like my dad all over again. I feel abused by him. 

00:26:50
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. So it's someone having power over you? 

00:26:55
ALYSSA In a way. 

00:26:55
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:26:55
ALYSSA You know, emotionally. 

00:27:00
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. And it's your child and that ought to be sort of flipped around maybe a little bit. 

00:27:05
ALYSSA Yeah, but you know, he's 16 so... 

00:27:05
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. So here's the thing about sort of figuring out how, again, how to hold your power. So what do you think would help, in that situation? Just let's imagine that you're in the moment with him. You're feeling abused. Do you feel strong then or do you feel...how do you feel? 

00:27:20
ALYSSA No, I don't feel strong. I feel very vulnerable. 

00:27:25
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. Do you feel unsafe with him? 

00:27:25
ALYSSA I don't think he would do anything physically but I just feel so powerless, emotionally powerless. 

00:27:35
VANESSA JACKSON What do you think is the part that creates the powerlessness? Just that you don't know how to make him feel better? You don't know how to get him to dial it back? And the fact it's coming in from this old stuff. 

00:27:45
ALYSSA Yeah. I think it's, like I said, I'm reduced to a little girl almost, you know. It's not me the parent anymore. 

00:27:55
VANESSA JACKSON You know what, can we talk a little... I'm going to ask you to sort of follow me to a slightly weird place if it's okay with you. Any moment you don't want to be here, just tell me, okay? 

00:28:05
ALYSSA Okay. 

00:28:05
VANESSA JACKSON Because it's almost like you start out and you show up and you're this adult mother, like this 45-year-old woman with your child, even though he's sort of angry, and somewhere in the conversation it's like you drop and how old are you? 

00:28:15
ALYSSA I'm eight. 

00:28:20
VANESSA JACKSON You're eight. Okay. How hard is it to parent a 16-year-old when you're eight? 

00:28:25
ALYSSA Impossible. 

00:28:25
VANESSA JACKSON Impossible. And again, it's not like you want to be eight, but there's something in that interaction because if it punches that button, you know, from when you were a child and your dad is sort of angry and other things like that, then you drop to eight. Okay. So when I talk about how we get you back in your power, it's about how when the eight-year-old she's going to come up sometimes when that happens, because it's almost before you know it, you're eight. 

00:28:50
ALYSSA Okay. 

00:28:55
VANESSA JACKSON Does that happen sometimes? 

00:28:55
ALYSSA Yeah. I mean, I'm not even aware. 

00:28:55
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, but now you're aware of it and I don't want you to judge it. It's like she's here, she's eight, let's just be with that. But then comes your job to get your eight, to take care of your eight-year-old in that moment. Does that make sense? 

00:29:10
ALYSSA Okay. 

00:29:10
VANESSA JACKSON So let's imagine you're the mother of that eight-year-old. Okay. So we understand that there's a 16-year old over here doing stuff, but there's always the way of let's look at the eight-year-old. What does she need in that moment to help her feel safe? 

00:29:30
ALYSSA To be heard, I just, you want somebody to hear me. You know, my frustration in somebody because you know, Mama, she when Dad was abusing me, she really was scared herself. So there was nobody to protect me. And so now I'm, you know, with him I feel that same way all over again, so just to be protected, to be heard and to know that I'm not going to be hurt physically or emotionally. 

00:29:55
VANESSA JACKSON We're going to do something, we're going to do both of these the same time. I'm going to invite you to be the mother that you needed. 

00:30:05
ALYSSA Okay. 

00:30:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. So even imagine what that, because you didn't get it, so you're going to have to imagine maybe what that looks like, a little bit. So if you had the mother when you were eight, that would protect you, to help her know that she's safe even in the face of someone's anger, what would that mother do for you? 

00:30:20
ALYSSA Well, she would have gotten help for the family, even if it was outside but you know, it was always about family secrets. 

00:30:35
VANESSA JACKSON We're going to have you be the good mother, the healing mother to your eight-year-old. You got adult you and we got eight-year-old you. So we're going to, like put a circle around the two of you are right now and leave the 16-year-old outside the door for a second. Because what I'm trying to do is support you around being able to honor her feelings, not that she has to shut up or stuff it, fix the 16-year-old, but that she gets heard. The person that needs to hear her is you, the adult you. It's where that you're going to nurture and mother her so that she can know that she's safe. And that she can feel her power, which includes the power to ask for help and have someone respond, which wasn't what you got, right? 

00:31:20
ALYSSA Okay. 

00:31:20
VANESSA JACKSON So let's practice. So I want you to be that mother to your eight-year-old. What do you say to her? What do you say to your eight-year-old that you really needed to hear when you were eight? 

00:31:40
ALYSSA I know what's going on. I know what's going on and I'm getting help for you and I'm not going to let him hurt you. 

00:31:50
VANESSA JACKSON And can you imagine yourself? Can you imagine your eight-year-old self? What is she doing now that you're hearing that story, when you're hearing someone that says I'm going to keep you safe. I'm going to use my power to keep you safe. What's she doing in this? 

00:32:05
ALYSSA I feel like I'm growing, because I feel so small usually and I'm all alone. To hear her say that makes me feel bigger. 

00:32:15
VANESSA JACKSON When you say growing, like just getting older or just getting just... 

00:32:20
ALYSSA No, inside. I feel much more joy and I don't feel as pushed down. I feel like a person even though I'm eight, I feel more like a person. 

00:32:35
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. You value that people hear you and you're not scared. Are you scared still? 

00:32:40
ALYSSA Right. No. Because I know Mommy hears me. 

00:32:40
VANESSA JACKSON All right, good. What else does she need to hear to help her stay big and strong and powerful? What else does she need to hear? 

00:32:50
ALYSSA That it's not, that what's happening is not my fault. 

00:32:55
VANESSA JACKSON So, that she's not to blame. 

00:32:55
ALYSSA Right. 

00:33:00
VANESSA JACKSON Can you sort of, in your mind's eye, have that conversation right now with the adult you, the mom you, and the eight-year-old? Is that helpful to you? So, can you see them doing that? 

00:33:10
ALYSSA Right. Yeah, I can. Mommy is saying that Daddy is hurt and he's sick and he needs help. But I haven't done anything wrong. 

00:33:20
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And how does that make you feel now? 

00:33:25
ALYSSA I feel bigger. 

00:33:25
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. How big are you? So tell me about this bigger feeling that you're having. 

00:33:30
ALYSSA Well, I just feel big inside, like my heart feels big. 

00:33:40
VANESSA JACKSON Does it feel big enough to sort of look over at that 16-year-old, or do we need to do some more growing up? Just check, you'll know. Do we need some more conversation to help her know that she can stand behind Mom and let Mom handle the 16-year-old? Or give her a box of crayons and go somewhere safe. 

00:33:55
ALYSSA I'm getting there, but not quite. 

00:34:00
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. What else does she need to hear? 

00:34:05
ALYSSA That she's not being judged, not being judged. Even as I get bigger, people are not judging me, because I feel so judged. 

00:34:20
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. When you start feeling judged, what happens inside? 

00:34:20
ALYSSA I get small again. 

00:34:25
VANESSA JACKSON You get small again. Okay. I want you to see it almost like a little valve between like, you know, you let water in a balloon and it fills up. If someone starts judging you, the water goes down. Then you can sort of fill it back up. You can tell the difference between, sort of when you're full and big and when something's going on that has compressed it. 

00:34:40
ALYSSA Right. 

00:34:45
VANESSA JACKSON I want you to start, you know, like you said before, when things start happening with your son, it's like happening so fast that you get little fast. Right? 

00:34:50
ALYSSA Right. 

00:34:50
VANESSA JACKSON And you almost didn't know what was going on. I want to sort of let you get some more consciousness and control about that. 

00:35:00
ALYSSA Okay. 

00:35:00
VANESSA JACKSON Does that make sense? 

00:35:00
ALYSSA Yes. 

00:35:05
[sil.] 

00:35:05
VANESSA JACKSON Come in taking a stand, fighting back, expressing your creativity. All of those are ways to express power and sort of fill your tank up. 

00:35:15
ALYSSA Okay. 

00:35:15
VANESSA JACKSON Because you always want to kind of keep it, like, where is your power tank? Some days, it's going to be low and when it's low it's like not judging yourself. But you do want to go and figure out why is it low? 

00:35:30
ALYSSA Okay. 

00:35:30
VANESSA JACKSON Does that make sense? 

00:35:30
ALYSSA Yeah. 

00:35:30
VANESSA JACKSON Do you have the tools to sort of judge that you think? Like sort of notice? How would you know if your power tank was sort of low or if it was high? 

00:35:40
ALYSSA Wow. I think you said something about checking in because sometimes I feel like I'm just on auto-pilot and I get up in the morning and I just go until I just fall out. You know, not 10 or 11 o'clock at night and I don't... It's just like it's not even me, I'm a machine like a robot. 

00:36:05
VANESSA JACKSON Here's the thing about getting power back, you sort of need to get your soul back. Like a machine has no soul right? 

00:36:15
ALYSSA Right. 

00:36:15
VANESSA JACKSON It's just go and go and go and go. Some of it is like being able to get that pause, which is real hard to get if you feel like, if I slow down, life is going to roll over me. Court's calling and boss needs something and siblings or parents want something. If you could even think about how to grab five minutes that were just about you, nobody else, not your son. It's one of those "I wouldn't spit on you if you were on fire right now" moments. When do you grab five minutes for yourself? 

00:36:45
ALYSSA Sadly, it's in the car in the evening. 

00:36:50
VANESSA JACKSON But tell me about that time. What do you do? 

00:36:50
ALYSSA Well, you know, I have a long commute because I work. Do you know Alpharetta? Yeah, I work in Alpharetta so my commute on the freeway it could take anywhere from an hour or two, depending on the traffic. But what I do is I have these motivational tapes that I put in and that's my escape. 

00:37:10
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. Here's the thing, I want to invite you, you know, I really got this spark and I wanted to check and see if it resonated for you. When you talked about your commute as your escape. 

00:37:20
ALYSSA Yeah, that's sad. That's not really a life, but it is what it is. 

00:37:25
VANESSA JACKSON Can I offer you a slightly different take on that, see if it works for you? 

00:37:30
ALYSSA Okay. 

00:37:30
VANESSA JACKSON Because when you said escape, I kept thinking she has learned how to turn an hour commute into a mobile sanctuary. 

00:37:40
ALYSSA I like that term. 

00:37:40
VANESSA JACKSON You know? And you've got your tapes and are these tapes uplifting or like sort of, when you're listening to them, what's happening for you? 

00:37:50
ALYSSA Well, you know, it makes me think, but they're positive. Have you heard about that man Deepak? 

00:37:55
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. 

00:38:00
ALYSSA Okay, well I listen to him, you know, because I believe in the law of attraction. 

00:38:05
VANESSA JACKSON So it anchors you in that sense about staying connected to your positive you and bringing it. You know, that's a power, what I call power from within. It's something that's in you. I can call it up, even if it's not present I can call it up. So when you're listening to Deepak Chopra and you're listening to the law of attraction and you're being positive, what kind of images come into your mind when you're doing your drive? Can we call it your mobile sanctuary? Is that okay? 

00:38:25
ALYSSA Yeah. I like that. 

00:38:30
VANESSA JACKSON When you get in your car, you pull out of the driveway, you leave adolescent-ville and you get in your mobile sanctuary. It's your temple. What are the messages that are coming in for you? 

00:38:40
ALYSSA Well, one is peace and I can be with my own thought. Even though I'm listening to him, I can be with my own thoughts. Because sometimes my mind, even though he's talking, it's almost like background noise in a way. It's that peace and it's weird because, you know, sometimes I have to catch myself, of course, because I get a little bit too far out there and I got to remember. 

00:39:10
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, you can't go into trance on the highway. 

00:39:10
ALYSSA Right. Yeah. But I do. It feels good you know. And it also helps me when I'm going into work. Because I've had that time to kind of, you know. 

00:39:25
VANESSA JACKSON Alyssa, I just am loving the way you're describing your commute, which is like this little vehicle peace going out to Alpharetta in the middle of all the traffic. Even though we agree that you sometimes have to make sure you don't go into trance you have constructed for yourself, do you realize this? This place of power and peace because there's peace, there's power and peace. 

00:39:45
ALYSSA I never saw it that way. It's just it's something somebody gave it to me and it looked like I never was going to have time at home. You know, it was always a phone or a question and I just got in the car one day and threw that CD in there. I've been doing it for about a year now. 

00:40:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. How? Why? So you end up, you leave home where there's a bunch of stress, you go to work where there's some stress, but you have created this bridge space that I think contributes to you, in the middle of all this stressful stuff, the old stuff, childhood stuff, stuff with your son. This powerful place of peace in this drive. Okay? So I want you to think about that. Now you can be, actually, in fact, a little bit more conscious that you made that happen. 

00:40:35
ALYSSA And that's a grown-up act. 

00:40:35
VANESSA JACKSON Total grown-up. It's a total, because you took what could have been an awful commute up 400 and you turned it into this powerful place of peace just for yourself. What that let's us do is, as we move forward, talk about other places that you can create for peace. Because you know how to do it. In spite of everything that's happened, everything that's going on, you have the power. You transformed a commute. So we can look at, like, where can I transform these other things in my life? That's about just what I call conjuring power and then part of that is about conjuring peace. Okay? So this seems like a pretty good place for us to stop it, because I don't want to make you late for your hair appointment. 

00:41:25
ALYSSA Okay, well I thank you. It was good. I appreciate you. 

00:41:30
VANESSA JACKSON Just sort of think about this and I love the voice of no too, the boundary-setter today. I've met some new pieces of you and I'm really excited about how she's going to keep showing up. 

00:41:45
ALYSSA Okay. 

00:41:45
VANESSA JACKSON All right? 

00:41:45
ALYSSA All right. 

00:41:45
VANESSA JACKSON Thank you. 

00:41:45
ALYSSA Thank you.
