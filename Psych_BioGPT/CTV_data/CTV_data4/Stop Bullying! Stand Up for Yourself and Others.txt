MARK BROWN Bullying probably affects a lot of you. 

00:00:25
UNKNOWN You're supposed be what everybody else wants you to be, when you're not. That's when you start getting bullied. 

00:00:30
MARK BROWN Maybe an experience of bullying has made you feel scared. 

00:00:35
UNKNOWN I didn't feel safe. 

00:00:35
MARK BROWN Sad. 

00:00:35
UNKNOWN My self-esteem was so low. 

00:00:40
MARK BROWN Worried or embarrassed. 

00:00:40
MARK BROWN I just wanted to people, to not notice me. 

00:00:45
MARK BROWN Having to deal with a bully might cause you to have a stomach ache, or not do things you don't want to do. 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN I didn't want to go to school anymore. 

00:00:50
MARK BROWN Or, feel like life is not worth living. 

00:00:55
UNKNOWN I knew that I couldn't go on. 

00:00:55
MARK BROWN Sometimes it's hard to keep you mind on school work, or enjoy your friends when you're worried about the next time a kid's going to push you around or call you names. 

00:01:05
UNKNOWN Throw us down on the floor, beat us up, spit on our face. 

00:01:05
MARK BROWN You are not alone, and you need to work together to stand up for yourselves and others in the fight to stop bullying. 

00:01:15

Mark Brown, Youth Motivational Specialist, QSP, Inc., a subsidiary of Reader's Digest 

00:01:15
MARK BROWN Hi, I'm Mark Brown and I was bullied as a kid. That could very well be the reason that as an adult I work so hard to try and stop bullying. I'm the spokesperson for QSP's national outreach program against bullying, and for the past 6 years I've traveled across the country, talking with 1,000's of kids just like you. I have 3 kids of my own, who at one time or another, have had to confront a bully. I understand what you're going through and you're not alone. 7 out of every 10 kids you know have been bullied. And, nobody should suffer at the hands of a bully. Kids need to help themselves and they must help each other. And, most important, they must reach out to a grown-up who can help. 

00:02:10

00:02:10
Segment #1:, What is bullying? 

00:02:25
UNKNOWN Freshmen year, one of my friends was interested in this senior boy. And, he had a girlfriend who was a senior and the boy started calling my friend. And, his girlfriend found out. And, so, she decided to get her group of friends, kind of against my group of friends. To make sure that the girl knew that he was taken and to stop talking to him and to kind of back off. Even though he was the one calling her and trying to hang out with her. And, it got to the point where my whole group of friends was being physically...not physically bullied, but, they would like hiss at us and, you know, call us names. And, it got to the point where I didn't feel safe walking down the halfway that they were walking down, because I was afraid that I was going to be like attacked. And, I was taking alternative routes in the school, to avoid seeing them in the hallways. And, it just got to the point where I couldn't take it anymore, my friends couldn't take it anymore. 

00:03:20
MARK BROWN Pushing, shoving, taunting, using words as weapons. Bullying happens anytime someone does something to someone else that makes them feel bad, either physically or emotionally. 

00:03:30
[music] 

00:03:30
UNKNOWN Uh, me and my brother, we got some...yes, really harassed. Like, it was mostly on the bus trip to home, because there was high schoolers, so, we were like the smallest kids on the bus. 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN The bus went from 5th grade to high school, so, it's a little mixed up but... 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN The bus driver really never paid attention. I don't know if he was intimidated by the high schoolers, but...I don't know. Anyway, so, uh, yeah, we...me and... they used to like draw on us... 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN Faces. Throw us down on the floor, beat us up, spit on our face, draw on our face. Just anything that you think is horrible you...that's what happened to us. 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN I think that there are a lot of aspects of bullying. Um, there's the physical aspect of getting pushed around in the hallway or intimidation. I think that bullying also includes psychological aspects, um, teasing, name calling, getting inside people's heads so it starts eating away at them. 

00:04:40
MARK BROWN No one deserves to have these things done to him or her and you should never believe that it's your fault you're being bullied. Everybody counts and every word said to you counts. If you're being bullied, or you know someone whose being bullied, you need to tell an adult you trust about it. Now, that may not seem easy, but it will help. And, if all kids get together and take a stand against the bullies in their school, even if they're not the ones being bullied, we might be able to solve this problem.

Segment #2:, Who gets bullied? 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN Well, last year, um, I was in a tough situation and I had to wear this, uh, this kind of a brace kind of thing, where, uh, it kind of...it was pretty ugly. Um, it was basically like waist up, I had a collar around head and I couldn't really move. One time I was in math class and I was trying to sit down and I fell over. And, this girl that was sitting a row over from me started hysterically laughing and point at me in front of the whole class. This happened a couple, couple times and, you know, maybe not...I didn't fall over my chair a couple times, but, you know, she would find a way to make fun of my situation. 

00:06:15
MARK BROWN Bullies usually pick on someone they think they can push around, or someone who they can make feel bad. Sometimes, the bullies just pick on someone for no reason at all. But, mostly bullies pick on other kids because deep inside they feel bad about themselves in some way. 

00:06:30
[music] 

00:06:35
UNKNOWN There was, um, a kid in our middle school that was just different than everybody else. He was unathletic, not coordinated, talked differently. He just didn't seem to hang around the same kids, and I think just different. But, I think different is huge in middle school, because you're supposed to be what everybody else wants you to be, like...when you're not is when you start getting bullied. 

00:07:05
UNKNOWN Around in the 7th grade hall, sometimes you'll people just getting picked on for how they look, or how they dress, or their weight or anything that people think is not normal. 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN I think the kind of people who are victims of bullying are really, anyone. There's always a flaw in someone's personality that their not sure about, and really, you know, you will become a victim if, you know, that certain part of your personality is kind of broadcasted by a bully. I think that, you know, it can really go from a jock to the really quiet kid, uh, it doesn't really matter. 

00:07:50
MARK BROWN It's surprising that all sorts of people, who are now adults, were once victims of bullying. When I was a kid, I didn't feel that I would ever have the confidence in myself after my experience with bullying. Ask one of your parents if they were ever bullied when they were young. You will be surprised at what they say. It's cool to know, you aren't alone in this. It is possible to become a confident and happy person in spite of being made fun of, or pushed around at school.

Segment #3:, Why do bullies, behave so badly? 

00:08:35
MARK BROWN Boys and girls can be bullies and there are definite differences in the ways boys and girls bully. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN When a boy bullies someone, I think that they use their hormones and physically try to bully that person or the victim. I think that they hit people more than girls would. 

00:08:55
UNKNOWN You'll always find girls that won't physically fight. But, I thinks it's more of like the name calling or attacking how the girl looks. What the girl's wearing, what the girl did the weekend before. I don't think that it's more on the physical aspect, it's more on the verbal attacking of girls. 

00:09:15
MARK BROWN Bullies act the way they do for many reasons. They may think that bullying is a way to be popular, or a way to get what they want. Some bullies come from families where everyone is angry and shouting all the time. And, they may think that being angry, calling people names and pushing people around is a normal way to act. 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN I think people are bullies because they're insecure about themselves, and that sometimes by teasing on someone else, or bullying someone else, they get also...almost a natural high that makes them feel better about themselves. Because, they're picking on someone else that might have something that...that, you know, they're different. So, they're getting picked on because they're different, and the person that's picking on them feels better about themselves after that. 

00:09:55
MARK BROWN Bullies have often been picked on or mistreated themselves. They may have difficulty at home, like their parents breaking up, or they don't know how to feel, so they pick on someone else. Most bullies are trying to make themselves feel more important. When they pick on someone else, it makes them feel big and powerful. 

00:10:15
UNKNOWN I think that usually when somebody bullies someone else, it's like a cry for help. The bullier needs to be taught that that's not okay what they're doing, or that they are hurting inside and something's going on inside their head that they need some help with. 

00:10:30
MARK BROWN They need to understand that their words and actions can hurt. Bullies need to remember the golden rule. Do unto others, as you'd have them do unto you.

00:10:55
Segment #4:, What should you do, if you are being, bullied? 

00:11:00
UNKNOWN That was probably our first mistake, we probably should have told somebody right there. And, then it probably would have passed by, because they'd be like "oh, we can't mess them because we'll get told on," and stuff like that. But, uh, we waited and thought it was just going to pass. 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN It's really bad... 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN That was a mistake. 

00:11:15
Walk, away 

00:11:15
Stay, with a, group of, friends. 

00:11:15
Use, humor 

00:11:15
Stand up, for, yourself 

00:11:15
Never, bully, back 

00:11:15
MARK BROWN The most important thing to remember to do, if you are being bullied, is to talk to an adult you trust. That's right, now, I know you may be afraid to talk to your principal, but maybe you can talk to your favorite teacher, your choir director, your baseball coach. Someone who is there at school, who can help you deal with the problem without the bully finding out. And, talk to your parents, they can help too. Here are some other important things to remember if you're being bullied. First, walk away. Don't put yourself in a place where a bully can get to you. When possible, always stay with a group of friends, there's safety in numbers. Sometimes, humor works to help to defuse a potential problem situation. As a kid with big ears, I got teased, what would I say? "Better to hear you, ha, ha, ha." And, walk away. Sometimes, you can stand up for yourself, now, I don't mean fight. What I mean is, walk with more confidence, shoulders up, head high. Let the bully know, you aren't afraid of them. And, remember, 1 thing you should never ever do is bully back. 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN I think ignore it, when they are infront of their friends and confront the person one on one. 

00:12:30
UNKNOWN If you are getting bullied severely, and you've done like everything that's possible, you should really try to get into sports or, like, get into something so you can express that anger, which really relieves you. Like, music that was me and Gavin's was football. 

00:12:40
UNKNOWN The best thing you can do is stand up to your bullier, and confront them face to face. The worst thing that they can do is not do something about it. 

00:12:50
UNKNOWN If you have confidence in yourself, they won't ever touch you, that's the main thing your supposes to have. 

00:12:55
MARK BROWN Don't let others push you around. If you need help sticking up for yourself, ask an adult in what you should do. No one deserves to be bullied. If you see someone being bullied, help that person, show you care. Tell an adult.

00:13:25
Segment #5:, How can you help, someone who is, being bullied? 

00:13:30
UNKNOWN No kid ever stood up for us. It was just...no one had any empathy. 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN I did not do anything to help. I think when you're in middle school, everyone's afraid of, if you try to do anything to help, especially if you're trying to be friends with this cool kid who's the bully. You don't want to get singled out yourself, and then become the person who's being bullied. 

00:13:50
Don't join in 

00:13:50
Don't ignore it 

00:13:50
Be a, good friend, and a great, listener 

00:13:50
Look, and listen, for signs 

00:13:50
MARK BROWN One of the best ways to help someone who's being bullied is to help him or her to ask for help. It's not easy to ask for help when you're being picked on, because you're worried about the bully finding out and afraid of getting picked on worse. So, having someone you can ask for help is a really great thing you can do. Here are some other things you can do to help a person who's being bullied. Don't join in on the bullying. Always treat the other kids at school with respect. Don't ignore it either. Many kids don't want to help someone who's being bullied because their afraid they'll get picked on too. But, if none of us put up with the behavior of a bully, the bully will have to stop. Be a good friend and a great listener to someone who's being victimized by a bully. Again, that may seem hard because you're afraid you'll get picked on too. But, it's the right thing to do, and if you know someone whose being harassed, look and listen for signs the person might be thinking of hurting themselves, skipping school or taking drugs. If you notice anything unusual, tell an adult immediately. 

00:14:55
UNKNOWN Usually, they'll turn like red. Like right on the spot they'll start blushing or, you know, even just kind of walk away. Or, maybe start crying. Those are like immediate signs. I think over time, they can become really withdrawn from people kind of just like, "I get picked on, I just want to totally avoid people altogether." And, then I think like the extreme case would be depression. Girls will actually develop eating disorders, um, anorexia, bulimia. Um, I have friends that that's happened to before and its changed their lives. You know, they have to battle this horrible illness now. 

00:15:35
MARK BROWN It's hard for somebody being bullied to help themselves. So, it's really important that if you see someone getting pushed around or picked on, then you help them. 

00:15:50

00:16:00
Segment #6:, Whom can you tell, when you are being, bullied or when you, see someone being, bullied? 

00:16:00
UNKNOWN I was afraid that the girls were going to find out that I was, you know, being a tattletale on them and that it was going to lead to more bullying. 

00:16:10
MARK BROWN Telling someone about being bullied isn't being a tattletale, you have the right to be safe and not made fun of. Often we don't talk about being bullied, because we're afraid the bully will find out. But, every person has the right to be respected by another person and you need to stick up for that right and reach out for help. 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN As hard as it is, I mean, you just have to find someone that you trust. It doesn't even have to be in school. It could be a parent, it could be a friend, it could be, um, a mentor. 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN Even after you have, like, say like an older brother, an older sister, it's even helpful just to talk to them. 

00:16:45
UNKNOWN If you tell your bus driver and...to watch it and the next time it happens, when he sees what's happening, if he sees it and he tells everyone to stop, they'll stop. And, if they don't stop, they'll be kicked off the bus or suspended or something like that. And, if they see that, then they'll just back away. 

00:17:05
MARK BROWN Telling someone that you've been beat up, or picked on, is very important. Most of us have at least one adult we trust, who we can tell about what's happening. If you can't tell them in person, then write them a note. 

00:17:15
UNKNOWN You don't like...at least tell someone to help you in trying to find the solution to what your problem is. You're just...and just them bully you that much, it's not going to stop. 

00:17:25
What, happened to, you and what, you did 

00:17:25
Who, bullied you, and who saw, it happen 

00:17:25
Where, it happened, and how, often 

00:17:25
Write down, everything, that, happened, to you 

00:17:30
MARK BROWN When you go to talk with an adult about what's going on, think about telling them the following things. What happened to you and what you did. Who bullied you and who saw it happen. Where it happened and how often it happens. And then, write down everything that happened to you. 

00:17:45
UNKNOWN You should go to a guidance counselor or something like that. Go to them and just talk to them, they'll understand. And, uh, they'll try and work out your problem. They'll tell you what's wrong and what's right, and what they want you to do. And, it really kind of helps you, because you can get something off your back. 

00:18:05
UNKNOWN I love the feeling that I had my parents behind me, my friends behind me, the school behind me. I thought that was the best, because at the beginning I was all alone and I felt that I was personally being threatened by these girls. And, that there was nobody that I could talk to, I mean, I kind of kept it all inside. I mean, eventually you have to do something about it. You can't, you know, live your 4 years in high school, or you know, wherever you are with that fear that, you know, something's going to happen every day or that you have to actually plan out in your head a route to go around it. That's not how...you can't live that way. 

00:18:40
UNKNOWN I think the best way to prevent bullying is stop it at it's source. Going to the teachers or any position of authority right away. A lot of kids don't like to go to the teachers, because then you're a tattletale. And then, no one wants to tell on anybody, then you start getting made fun of. But, I think you need to go to the teachers right away. The teachers won't use your name, they won't say who told who. 

00:19:05
MARK BROWN Kids are hurt daily by the words and actions of their peers. And, if you're like most kids in this country, you've either been bullied or you know someone who has. Maybe you are the bully. Whatever role you're playing one thing is for sure, if stop for 1 moment to think about the power of your own words and actions, it would your first step, our first step towards putting an end to the serious problem of bullying.
