MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Hi, my name is Matt Englar-Carlson and I'm the host of, of this video series on the skills of counseling. This program is on techniques for creating insight I'd like welcome our featured guest, Rita Sommers-Flanagan. Hello and welcome. 

00:00:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Hi, and thank you. 

00:00:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Let's start by getting to know you a little bit. Can you tell us about your approach to counseling, just what do you hope to, to accomplish? 

00:00:50
Rita Sommers-Flanagan, PhD 

00:00:50
Department of Counselor Education, University of Montana 

00:00:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Sure. I, I, I often think of what's the difference between your approach and your theoretical orientation and uh… And I think there are differences. My approach is a more global thing and I would say that my approach is humanistic. 

00:01:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:01:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And I see myself as a professional, dedicated to helping ping people cope or change or grow or heel or reach their full capacity. So that's in sync with my humanistic orientation. I believe they can do that with some assistance. And so that's, that's my approach. Umm… 

00:01:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That's got your orientation to work and… Okay. 

00:01:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. But I'm also umm… very flexible. And I, I think the word eclectic is overused, but I'll be using it throughout our conversation for sure. But I also want to know that I'm flexible in uh… the level of formality. I'm flexible in office setting and in other um… domains that I have control, because I think my job is to be the best match possible for the clients and the situation. So I, I am not a full on chameleon, but I would say humanistic and very flexible. 

00:02:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it sounds like you have some things you, as a counselor they are really important to you. You, you want be flexible. You want to kind the clients where they are uh… and that's humanistic aspect that kind of… a clinical relationship? 

00:02:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. I believe in them. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. 

00:02:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So for you as a counselor… If you're counseling is effective, what you want to see happen? 

00:02:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, that's, that follows with the approach. Umm… In the true essence of the answer, I want what the client wants to happen, to happen. I am fully client centered in that way. And I think that the client should be who determines what is effective. 

00:02:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:02:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Of course that sort of idealistic because… Uh… I don't know if you've been a client, I certainly have been and, and worked with lots of clients and it's, it's not so easy to know what it is you want to accomplish in counseling. You know something's bothering. You know something hurts. So really to be effective, the first step is to help clarify why you're there. Why the client is there. And even that step uh… If that's accomplished can be a pretty therapeutic and effective. 

00:03:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Absolutely. Yeah, yeah. 

00:03:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So then the other problem will say that is that, not everyone is thrilled to be in counseling. So you could have the reluctant spouse or the angry adolescent. You have got that happily delusional person that someone wants to change, but they don't. So then effectiveness really for me backs up to be uh… a measure of "can I get this person to be at ease in the room with me and, and make use of the time we're gonna have together?" If that's a no, then another thing that's important to me is that we do no harm. And so staying, pretending, staying with someone umm… who is clearly not gonna engage is not effective. I think we back off and find something else. 

00:04:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like it's really critical to meet clients where they are and if you're able to do that, in a way that's kind of the beginning of, of having an effective outcome. Umm… again recognizing that not all clients want to be there. 

00:04:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. You way to go upstream sometimes. 

00:04:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. It's really easy to answer that question with idea that our clients are… They are all action oriented. They are all excited to be there. But the truth of the matter is, is that, you know, it's not the case. 

00:04:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN No. 

00:04:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. When you do your counseling do you use any outcome measures that kind of show you work has been affective? 

00:04:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, I have and do. Uh… It depend on the setting. I use… Sometimes I've used questionnaires and standardized rating scales. 

00:04:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:04:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I make it a practice to try to do a very mini evaluative closure with each session. Was this what you expected? How we do today? Questions like that that bring closure. 

00:04:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And that's like a verbal kind of… Is in a few minutes. 

00:05:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. yeah, exactly. And umm… in a bigger way I do that when counseling is winding down as part of termination. And one time I was running a group and I've tried this a couple times. I, I mailed umm…. The, the group notes mid week and asked for feedback on how people thought the group was going in terms of the process and the progress of the group. And that was really effective. It kept things alive throughout the week and it also let me know, you know, what the group members perceptions were versus mine. 

00:05:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:05:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:05:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like you're open to a variety of kind of methods based on the setting uh… and then, that, it sounds like it helps you get feedback in terms of kind of what you're doing well, but also in terms of how come the client's goals kinds of change and evolve. Good. And you mentioned earlier that uh… you're eclectic, but do you have any particular kind of influences around theory or do you follow one particular theoretical approach? 

00:05:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes, I do. Even though I'm a eclectic. 

00:05:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:05:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN In my personal life I am firmly a feminist, have been for a long time. And feminist theory, I believe is the best fit for me. But, you know, like a lot of the theories I'd classify as humanistic, umm… feminist theory borrows from and contributes to person centered, adlarian. Uh… a little tiny bit of analytic even, depending, and certainly multicultural. There's a lot of overlap. So theoretically uh… I'm in that camp and identify as a feminist. 

00:06:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Any particular things about that model that I think really speak to you as a therapist that you really… Like you said, like, you're, you're feminist as your core, but you might do feminist influence kind of humanistic work or feminism influenced, adlerian, you're analytical. Now can you, can you tell me more about that, for you what it means to kind of be a feminist therapist and… ? 

00:06:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, I think it means that the orientation is to the core relationship, that there's an egalitarian value even though I know, I'm supposed to be the expert and that's something to offer. Uh… the client is of equal value in the room. And umm… I think that a lot of times the troubles people face are cost from societal injustices rather than something core wrong with them and having them grapple with what that means to be one down in the culture. Umm… so those are some of the tenants in feminist therapy that I use. 

00:07:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it sounds like that, creating that egalitarian relationship, kind of, kind of power sharing and, and in session but also being really where kind of social political reality and contacts and how it influence peoples lives. 

00:07:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. Right. But I don't hesitate to borrow techniques all the way across, all theories. I just don't necessarily buy their explanation of human nature. 

00:07:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You might, you like, like a, like a feminist version of that or influence or inform some. 

00:08:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. Yeah. 

00:08:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Umm… Can't tell us a little bit about your background and how you became to be a professional counselor? 

00:08:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Sure. I was born and raised in Montana on a ranch and I still came out a feminists. So that was my first multicultural… 

00:08:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That was a good one. Yeah. 

00:08:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. Uh… And then I got a masters degree in interpersonal communication, managed to parlay that into a job as a rehab counselor, first for the State of Montana and then private rehab. 

00:08:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:08:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And, you know, at, at that level it was a pretty um… interdisciplinary masters and I am good at talking my way in the door. So suddenly I had a job and, and probably not the skills I should have had. So I realized that along the way and thought, umm… I think I need to go back to grad school. I uh… was accepted into the clinical psychology program in Missoula. And I, I didn't really know what I was getting into. I think I had like two classes in psychology. So that was… 

00:09:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You came at that now all right. 

00:09:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I… Oh, yeah. Many years later I said, oh, how that happened? Umm… So that's a five year endeavor and I, I found out during that time that I actually really like teaching college students. I wouldn't have known that any other way. And I also worked at the Morrison center in Portland for my yearlong internship. 

00:09:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:09:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Its center for using families that are extremely traumatized, really severe needs. And there were teams of people working there, social workers, counselors, psychiatrists, psychologists, nurse practitioners, all sorts of people. And that was a great internship because I realized the common ground all of the professions have and how much we all bring to, to the table. So I learned to, to value all of that. Then, a job was open in the Counselor Education Department in Missoula and I was hired there and developed my identity as a professional counselor educator. So I kind of carry all of those, those hats. Twenty six years later, I'm now happily retired from academia and focus more on my writing. 

00:10:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Now in your story I can, I can hear how you've, you've come into your orientation, how you view the work and the importance of, of kind of working across with a different kind of, kind of professionals in the field and also kind of seeing kind of marginalization at different forms. 

00:10:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:10:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Umm… And you mentioned that, that your, you're a faculty member for a long time and, and teaching is so important to you. I wonder, what are the most important areas you want to make sure your students understand as counselors? 

00:10:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, I'm afraid when I enter this, they will be a big groan from the viewers. But, umm… ethics. I, I am a firm believer that ethics or morality, whatever word you want to use, define what it means to be human. And I think professional ethics or applied ethics, practical ethics define what it means to be that profession. So for counselors umm… learning… Not, not the rules and regulations, the deeper stuff. Why are we doing this? Why do people pay us to do this? How do our values intersect? Those are the deeper questions. And, you know, uh… I feel like when people treat counseling lightly, they are, they are acting as if it's an inert substance, it's not powerful and it is powerful. And if you don't learn the ethical foundation, then I think professional helpers could easily become professional manipulators. It… The stuff we do works, it makes a difference. And so that ethical foundation is my first answer. If you don't have that, then I think you're dangerous. Umm… And then I think teaching, uh… basic listening skills and a certain kind of restraint. 

00:11:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:11:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… because when you first start being a counselor, you want to have some magic, you want to do something and fix people. 

00:12:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:12:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And uh… you… It's not inert, but it's also not magic, it's work and it's work on the client's part. And so another important aspect I think students need to learn is how to be in the room, listen, be comfortable with silence. I never tell a student, oh, just try something. I want them to learn what it means to have a technique in mind, share it with the client, make sure it's, it's gonna be a safe thing for the client to try. And if not just sit there. Sometimes silence is one of the more powerful techniques we have. Umm… And then the more advanced skills as all of that gets put in place. I think it's really important to learn how to delay your own gratification. Compassion is huge uhh… And uh… those deeper listening skills that come with compassion. 

00:13:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, Yeah. And, Rita, I hear in what you're saying that it's, it's, there's recognition, that, that you said, these skills work in counseling, it's effective and with that comes a huge amount of responsibility. And that we don't act all the way, nearly, that we're aware of kind of how we can be effective and when we need to be effective. We don't, we don't treat clients as guinea pigs. You know, we kind of really aware of that aspect and at the core… 

00:13:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And they are really not there for our gratification. Yeah. 

00:13:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. Right. Yeah. I'm thinking that really plays in to umm… what you're demonstrating today and which is Insight. Umm… because insight itself is a really powerful, powerful technique as well. Umm… I'm kind of wondering what you consider is insight and what has to happen? 

00:13:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN A lot of people wonder. That's it. I, I thought, I thought a lot about that. I think, you know, basic Webster sort of dictionary is the uh… Our definition is the attainment of a newer, deeper set of truths or explanations. Uh… And I think that's true. It's, it's linked to intuition. Umm… It's a inner vision, in side. You see something inside or from a different angle that explains the why's that we're always wondering about inner worlds. 

00:14:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. So it's an internal aspect, like, like you broke that down with the insight because that's really true, right? Umm… Some people believe that the insight stage is where kind of the counselor kind of hooks the client to see the problem through, through different lenses. Is that how you see this as well? 

00:14:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… I don't mean to hurt you feelings. 

00:14:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That's okay. That's some… That taught me, some experts, so… 

00:14:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. Good. It's that word hook that I reject you. Umm… I know, you know, Montana, you're supposed to be a fly fisherman and, and the hook thing, yeah. But I don't like fishing. And I also… Hook for me cannot something slightly involuntary. If you've been around fishing… 

00:15:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Like a pulling? 

00:15:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, it's like hook. So umm… So I think instead it's a much more uh… gentle process and it's… I think another term might be by in. That you, you're working to set a relationship and safe, a safe frame so that people can explore something that you might be afraid to explore. And, and so, yeah, insight plays a role in that. I'll call them baby insights. You, you hope for a little insight, so that the person goes home and things. Uh… you know… They are wondering. They are thinking. They are starting to see the world a little bit differently. So I think the insight stage uh… is, is part of the buy in that clients when they really commit to making changes. Yeah. 

00:16:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, Rita, as you say that I can really see that you're really thoughtful in how you were and, and creating safety is, is really critical, right? So they get that reframe from a hook to a buy-in makes a lot more sense, right inside as a buy-in in which the client maybe begins the kind of high and thoughtful place, where it feel safe and again to allow him or herself to kind of maybe experience or see something a bit, bit differently. 

00:16:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, exactly, yeah. 

00:16:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Some might say that umm….insight isn't necessary, that we change cognition or we behaviors and that's all we need. How would you respond to that? 

00:16:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, I, I would say not necessary for what? 

00:16:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:16:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… Maybe it isn't necessary to change a behavior or cognition at the surface. Well, we know it's not. Because we can change the behaviors of pigeons and I don't think they have any insight into what's gonna on, they just know the foods over there. So uh… I think that sometimes that's where we start, because sometimes a behavior or maladaptive set of cognitions can may be insurmountable to someone. And so we can use those approaches to make some changes. But I believe the changes, if they are gonna hang around lead to insight themselves. They really need to some level of awareness of where the source of that maladaptive that came from or why I kept behaving that way. And if you don't, you don't have those insights I, I think it's unlikely the change will stick. 

00:17:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it's kind of, it's kind of a deeper level of change that gaining that awareness, that, you know, again… 

00:17:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. And it doesn't have to happen in counseling. 

00:17:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:17:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It could happen later as, as the change has sort of settling in, kind of like, wow, now I see why I was doing that. But if that wow or that ah-huh doesn't happen at all, there's no change in awareness. I'm not sure it will stick. 

00:18:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. You mentioned that these things happen outside of the, outside of counseling as well. It sounds like you're quite open to kind of obviously using the counseling session to process these things to bring it up, but also knowing the clients who are gonna have these light bulb moments or kind of experiences outside, even beyond your work with them. Yeah. Yeah. What are some keys to success to working at the inside stage with clients? 

00:18:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, I think a lot of the techniques that we have developed that aim to facilitate insight are little bit uh… threatening. 

00:18:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Yeah, the same we worry about that. Yeah. 

00:18:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well they are a little wonky. I mean, you just don't go out and sit in two different chairs, you know. 

00:18:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:18:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… and so I think the… One key to success is collaboration with the client. Uh… inform consent in the process. Not… You don't write every technique down that you might uh… use with someone, but as the counselling going along, I don't think you just bring stuff on somebody. You talk it through and ask permission and collaborate with them on the process. So that's one key. Umm… if you're talking about attributes in your client, you, you need clients that are a little bit uh… open and… Well, you need the trusting relationship, and, and people that are willing to try things. Umm….and if we're talking about attributes in the counselor as part of the picture of success, I think umm… we have to be uh… congruent and comfortable in our own uh… skin to suggest things that are out of the ordinary. We have to be committed to the process. And, you know, what? We have to be humble. We have to be willing to umm… notice that it's really falling flat or it's not working. You take responsibility for that. Say, you know, I think I might have suggested something that's just not a good fit for you, it might not be the right time. So that's another piece of it, that uh… is really important, both for the counseling relationship and for insight. Yeah. 

00:20:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. I mean, again to me this goes back. We said earlier, it's like how do you create that safe space with a client and which some vision is like a true equal relationship happening. Uh… this often comes after already building a therapeutic relationship. You might have done some assessment, so then… And again that recognition that, that creating insight and actually going for insight is a powerful tool. 

00:20:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:20:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right? And, and again you must wield that, that carefully. 

00:20:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Absolutely and collaboratively. 

00:20:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Collaboratively? 

00:20:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:20:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So how do you side what to use with each client? And, you know, do you match or tailor certain ideas to the client or… ? 

00:20:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, that would be a client, by client answer. But, yeah, you definitely match. And I think uh… that factors that you consider are the, you know, the old basic factors, that culture of the client, the age of the client, the gender, the umm… psychological mindedness, the intellect, uh… the amount of time you've got to work with someone. If you're very time limited versus you got a lot time to work. Umm… And, you know, another thing. As you're considering a technique and you kind of size all those factors up and go, uh… maybe, maybe not. You might back off of it for a few weeks and then if you're continuing to collect data about your client, because of the exposure you're having, you may revise and you think. You know, they are never gonna go for that or they are perfect for this. I don't know why I hadn't think so before. So it's a, it's an ongoing process. But it's really important to match the types of interventions that we might try with all of those factors. And uh… there's no formula. I wish it would be a really complicated calculus level formula because if all the that goes. 

00:22:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:22:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:22:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It sounds like some of that calculation is based on experience, it's based on kind of understand your client really well. So that when you suggest a certain technique or a way to move, you're fairly certain that, that the client is ready for it, Right? 

00:22:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Exactly. 

00:22:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right, right. So there are many ways to, to achieve insight. And in this program you're gonna, you're gonna show us six. Umm… Before we go into the six you've chosen, can you talk more about some of the ways the insight kind of a curse in counseling? 

00:22:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Umm… I think it's a natural part of the process for most of us because humans are meaning makers. We're sentient beings, we always want to know why this causes this. We… That's part of our, how we're built. So in any meaningful relationship, there's gonna be exploration of cause and effect in that relationship. So it's a natural part of counseling. Umm… In fact, I, I think sometimes the counselling relationship itself can produce insight. 

00:23:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Get the insight. Yeah. 

00:23:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So for example, uh… may be a clichéd one. But, say a woman who comes into counselling and there's basically never had a healthy respectful relationship and the counselor enacts a healthy, caring, listening relationship. And this, this human being has basically ever had that, goes… Wow, this fells good. 

00:23:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. yeah. 

00:23:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I mean, what's going on? And, and until the first insight is just… It feels good to be respected in an, in an equal relationship. Then, that's the baby insight that can then lead to. Uh… I wonder why I've never… Why have I let this be such an absent piece of my life? So insight builds on insight. Umm… Another thing I think I mentioned earlier, but I think it's worth mentioning again is, silence can actually work to bring about insight. So when a client has a emotional outburst and the counselor is tempted to, to reflect or react. Sometimes just sitting, noticing, being with allows a kind of meditative presence in the room and, and it lets the client start to ask themselves, what's going on. Why am I just so wound up about this? And, and that's a really important process. Yeah. 

00:24:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, it just speaks to me as we kind of look at the counseling. These different kind of stages, you know, they are not really this, this, this, they really all like this. And that, you know, insights are constant, a constant aspect. And yet, in a moment you're gonna demonstrate particular techniques that kind of really focused on building that. But, but in many ways there's techniques across all, all stages. 

00:24:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Absolutely. Yeah. And we revisit assessment and we… You know, it's, it's, it's very circular. 

00:25:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, yeah. 

00:25:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:25:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So in a moment we're gonna, we're gonna watch you work and, and my hunch is that we're gonna begin to see some of these aspects of who you are that, yeah, building a caring relationship with the client, looking for permission, building collaboration and safety in many ways. And then as the clients begin to unpack certain things, the fact that you're, you're with the client as they do that. 

00:25:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna, we're gonna see some work with Gabe. 

00:25:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. 

00:25:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:25:30
Assessment Strategies 

00:25:30
Acknowledging and working with Differences 

00:25:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So what counselor attributes and competencies play a role in clients achieving some level of insight? 

00:25:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, I think because insight can be umm… facilitated by techniques that are uh… a little bit difficult to introduce and to believe in. I think first umm… clients themselves have to experience insight and have insight into their own strengths and weaknesses. Umm… to value insight, you have to have experienced it and have some level of capacity yourself. Uh… You know, it's really important to be uh… congruent, like and authentic I think with, with your clients. And so if you can't have a level of insight into your own motivations and places, you might have hotspots then you're gonna be guarded and, and less available. Umm… So even your office, uh… the way you dress, the way you locate, all of those factors play into setting an environment that's safer insight. Uh… In one way I talk about that with students is to be comfortable in your own skin. And of course in our world, skin can also color right away. And so to me it also means that counselors need to be multi-culturally aware. At, at all times it's really important as part of the insight process. 

00:27:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. So it sounds like you're saying that, that counselors need to be kind of, kind of where who they are umm… as a counselor, as a person and their space is consistent about that as well. But in particular you're saying, they need to be reflective about, maybe, maybe there are cultural identity and that's some work on that. 

00:27:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. 

00:27:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So tell me more about what you mean about being multi-culturally aware? 

00:27:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, umm… it's become a course a catchphrase. And there are terms like multicultural competence, multicultural umm… accuracies. Umm… I… When I say aware, I actually mean something a little bit deeper I think. And that is that really in my belief, all of counselling is multicultural. I know that could offend some people who have more distinct cultural features than others. But really, the truth is, we aren't alike and the clients I work with are not all alike because we might share some attribute, but certainly not all. And so I think being aware of differences and how that differences between client and counselor affect the process is really important part of, of insight. 

00:28:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:28:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… So that's what I mean by that. 

00:28:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it's a recognition in some ways that, that the counseling is, is the collaboration of two, kind of worldviews, experiences, kind of histories. And having some awareness that as that comes together, it means something. 

00:28:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. 

00:28:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:28:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And then being willing to work with that, with that difference in the room. 

00:28:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. What do you… What do you mean by that work with veterans in the room? 

00:28:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, we're actually… I'm hoping that in umm… in the work that we're gonna see… 

00:28:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, with Gabe coming up. 

00:28:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN With Gabe, that I can demonstrate that because it's actually a technique. I think it's an important aspect of creating insight. Yeah. And learning as a counselor how to speak about, how to, how the timing goes with that and how, how to bring that into the room as a technique. That's what I'm hoping will do. 

00:29:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. You, you mentioned that you're working with Gabe. I wonder if you can tell us a bit about, about Gabe and, and kind of set up that, that clip for us? 

00:29:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Umm… The first couple of sessions with Gabe were interesting. Gabe as a, as a young man, who identifies as Hispanic. But interestingly his mom is Asian, his dad came into the United States from Mexico and was a very accomplished surgeon, passed away in a car wreck when Gabe was 12. And Gabe's mom remarried uh… and so she gave Gabe's new stepfather control all the family finances which included control of Gabe's trust fund money. So this relatively nice guy has a lot of control in Gabe's life and has decided or did decide to uh… insist that Gabe come to counseling, which is always every counselor's joy. 

00:30:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. Exactly. 

00:30:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And you know, but… So Frank came the first session and uh… spelled out all the problems Gabe is having in the world, in front of Gabe, with Gabe, you know, rolling his eyes. And, umm… and to his credit, Gabe showed up the second session. It was pretty surfaced. We talked about college, this and that kind of, get acquainted, get Frank out of the room kind of session. And in this next session I hope to work with Gabe a little bit more directly on the situation and on our differences. 

00:30:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So the viewers should look for kind of maybe how you're acknowledging those differences, but also kind of working with him and building some type of collaborative bridge with him around that. 

00:30:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Exactly. Yeah. So, Gabe, you're here. 

00:30:55
GABE Uh-huh… 

00:30:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And we have some time to spend together. And Frank's not here, you know, an improvement over our first session. 

00:31:05
GABE Finally, yeah. 

00:31:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So what would you like to work on today you think? 

00:31:10
GABE Nothing. I mean, I don't want to be. Frank's making me come here. 

00:31:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I know. And here you are. 

00:31:20
GABE I mean, that's a control freak. Like, I don't need to be here. He hasn't have any right to tell me what to do. He's just wasting my time. 

00:31:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… So, Frank's a control freak. And it sounds like you're kind of sick of, of wasting time. 

00:31:35
GABE Yeah. I… I mean… Well, the thing is like, I don't waste my time, other people waste my time. 

00:31:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So sorry, I think I got that wrong. So you aren't sick of wasting time. It's not about your choices, it's about other people making choices in your life and it's a big waste of your time, they are wasting your time. Did I get that right? 

00:32:00
GABE Yeah, because I mean, I have my own life. You know, I do the things I like to do and I do them pretty well. It's when other people make demands and they tell me what to do that, I just don't like it. I really don't like it. 

00:32:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And I, I get that. I don't think I'd like it either. In fact, as I think about it, here we are, you know, me an old white lady trying to be of some kind of help to you and umm… in a way you could think of me wasting your time too. 

00:32:30
GABE Yeah. Yeah, okay, yeah. I mean, I still don't want to be here. 

00:32:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. No, I, I get that. And, and I get how that could feel because we're pretty different, this wasn't your idea. You're probably thinking how and uh… heck could she be any help to me? 

00:32:45
GABE No, I mean… Yeah, no, but I still don't want to be here. But, yeah, I mean, I'm still not so sure what the point of this is. It's just like I waste my time. And I'm not too sure if you gonna get me… 

00:32:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. So you have a lot of uncertainty about this and you're stuck here, we're stuck here together trying to make sense of it. And I'm guessing, just a guess, that this is not the first time you've been in this situation where you felt really different and, and really sort of someone else is in control of, of your time. 

00:33:20
GABE Oh, yeah, tell me about it. There's always people that have just kind of piss me off, my Frank, my mom, my step sister, the neighbors, you know, that stupid waiters at the restaurant that Frank likes go to. I feel like I'm totally surrounded by people who don't get me. 

00:33:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And, you know, here's a classic counseling question. How does it make you feel? 

00:33:35
GABE It pisses me off. 

00:33:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So you really pissed off, royally pissed off you, angry, furious and what else? 

00:33:45
GABE And what? 

00:33:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, I'm just guessing because, I know, we're in pretty different spaces, but if I put myself in your shoes just a little bit I think, I would feel very angry, but I might feel lonely, I might even feel a little bit sad. Is that fair at all? 

00:34:05
GABE Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yes. I chuck one for the doc. 

00:34:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You chuck one up for the doc. Oh-hu-huh… Yeah. Thanks. 

00:34:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I'm wondering if this is a pretty good example of kind of a, kind of a acknowledging working with differences in, in, in counseling. 

00:34:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, I, I hope so. 

00:34:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:34:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… I was able to articulate our differences and I felt like what we saw and what I felt in the room with Gabe was a slight trying of his sort of I see coolness and a little engagement which is exactly what I hoped for. So, yeah, I think, I think it did what I hoped that it would do. 

00:34:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. I mean, you said earlier like, you know, here, here's a young man who isn't necessarily here because he wants to be here. So he's kind of feeling his way in the counseling, but certainly about you. And, and like you acknowledged that, there are differences between the two of you. 

00:35:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. I'm not sure I felt about me saying, yeah, I'm an old white lady. But, you know, I think I saw a little glint in his eye. It certainly caught. He, his posture changed a little and, and he engaged. And then also, you know, another thing that happened was umm… I made a little listening error and own that and apologized. Oh, you know, not you wasting time but other people wasting your time. And I think often when you can just back off and admit a mistake, clients uh… warm up a little bit. So that was going on. Uh… and then the next natural thing after you acknowledge differences is to see, if there's a commonality that can rejoin and I tried that. 

00:35:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So how is that that, that creating insight between, between you two or for Gabe? How's, how's that creating insight? 

00:36:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, the inside I'm ultimately hoping for him or his first insight and it'll take shape in his way of it taking shape. But, Gabe is um… pulling away from people who we would think of as similar to him, but he is experiencing them as very different and as a reason to cut connections. And the inside I'm hoping could happen if he continues to work with me, the old white lady, is that umm… differences exist and we can benefit from that. We can have relationships with people that are very different than we are. Umm… and I don't think Gabe believes that right now. So if he glimpsed that in some form, I would call that an insight. 

00:36:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. So glimpsing that with you, right? 

00:36:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That's what I'm hoping. 

00:36:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. And there are any circumstances were kind of acknowledging these differences that might be contra indicated, that you wouldn't do that? 

00:37:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Oh, absolutely. 

00:37:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:37:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… and it's, it's delicate. Uh… and you find your own pockets of racism and, and other isms when you consider making one of those different statements, because you have to be very careful that you're not elevating yourself in some way and saying, well, we're different because I'm this cooler thing. And so if you find yourself umm… stopping because you're gonna say, well, you're Navajo and I'm white and you think, that's a devaluing statement, then you kind of uncovered a pocket of, of racism in yourself. So it's, it's a little bit tricky, but you would never say, well, I've got a college education and you don't, so we're pretty different. You know, stuff that's evaluative. And also if you sense that the difference has not, is not taking up a huge space in the room and you're going to do better by building some commonalities first, it's a timing thing. 

00:38:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

00:38:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:38:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like this kind of goes back, what you said originally is kind of being multi-culturally aware. And then the old maybe use that own personal side as a counselor to build bridges when appropriate, that not just to point things out or to kind of do this just to do it and it's, when it's, when it's indicated. 

00:38:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yep. 

00:38:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. Let's we bound to our, to our next skill which is reframing. 

00:38:20
Assessment Strategies 

00:38:20
Reframing 

00:38:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Can you tell me about the technique called Reframing? Is it… Is it commonly used technique? 

00:38:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I think so. I think we do it all the time. Actually, the term comes from uh… another term that we have in our culture called Frame of Reference. 

00:38:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:38:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And, and I think when we say a frame of reference, we're talking about a schema or a set of beliefs that we've, we've used to build an explanation. And that's the frame we've got or take on something. And that's how we see it and, and we call that the frame. 

00:39:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. You used the word scheme. So, so is this a cognitive technique? 

00:39:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, it can be because sometimes we use reason and cognitions to suggest something different, a different view. But it's not really a cognitive technique because uh… we also use mood. Uh… you know yourself. When you're very happy or confident, you see the world a different way, than when you're, you've just been rejected or lost someone or but, you know, the whole, your whole set of schemas are affected by that. And so a thought can change a frame, a mood can change a frame and, and it's interactive and we work in both directions. 

00:39:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So reframing it sounds like you're kind of offering the client a different frame or a new perspective. Uh… it's coming from you in many ways. So is there anything that makes a reframe more likely to be accepted by a client? 

00:39:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. I like, I like that observation. A lot of these are coming from the counselor and that's why they call for such caution. Yeah, reframe is definitely coming from me because I'm offering it as an alternate way to see something. And if she or he isn't, can't see it, I'm not gonna argue with them. 

00:40:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

00:40:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So umm… having your uh… description being a plausible reframe, having a little bit of evidence for the way you see it being possibly true, something they could buy is really important. And then umm… offering them a time to sort of… Well, how, how would it be if that were True? So you, you are really playing with it and seeing it a new way. Umm… so you have to be a credible authority in their lives, hopefully you are and, and it has to be plausible. 

00:40:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. It sounds like the last piece to your, you're kind of offering as an invitation. Yeah, like what if… Yeah. Okay. So in our next real play you're gonna, you're gonna show us how to, how to reframe a couple of those. Can you, can you set that up for us in terms of what's gonna happen? 

00:41:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. I umm… I'm gonna be working with a young mother who's at her wits end. She's a single mom, has a five year old, who sounds like a handful. 

00:41:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. So it sounds like, what we should look for then is, is may be, as the client began to talk about her experiences, you can begin to offer an alternative way of viewing it. And then how you offer that, that invitation to her and how that process unfolds. 

00:41:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh-huh… Exactly. 

00:41:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN You know, Rita, I just, I never thought that I would be even coming in for counseling. I just, I feel like a total failure. My daughter, I just, I'm just having so much trouble with her. I'm at the end of my rope and counseling for crazy people, right? But I'm getting there. 

00:41:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Wow. It sounds like you got a few challenges. 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean, you would not believe the tensions that she throws. Emily, she's, she's only five, but it's like she's possessed or something like… She did hours on end. 

00:42:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Wow. Like one tantrum hours on end? 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, it just goes and goes. I don't know what to do. 

00:42:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Holy cow. It sounds to me like you have a very strong willed and determined child. 

00:42:20
UNKNOWN I mean, that's one way to look at it, but I, I just don't know what to do. I'm at my wits end. 

00:42:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, it sounds like. This has been really frustrating lately and you're here, you're in counseling. You want to figure something out? But I have to say, it sounds like, I've heard about a lot of tantrums. Rarely do they go on for hours. I think she might be a gifted tantrum? 

00:42:40
UNKNOWN A gifted tantrum or… Well, that's, that's a little hard to hear. 

00:42:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah, it's, it's hard because underneath the tantrum are these positive things that children… That we want to see in our children, right? Strength, determination, self uh… a sense of self that they are asserting in the world, but we don't want to see the tantrum, right? That's the outcome of these gifts. It's getting expressed in a way that uh… is really hard for you it sounds like. 

00:43:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah, it is really hard for me. And I just… What do… What do I do now? 

00:43:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. So you're here, you're in counseling, that's a pretty big step. And I hear some ambivalence about that counseling but, but you're here. 

00:43:35
UNKNOWN I just… I don't have time to do this. You know, I work two jobs. I've got a kid. I'm a single mom. I'm just… I don't… 

00:43:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. You do want to be here and you don't want to be here. 

00:43:45
UNKNOWN Right. Exactly. Yeah. 

00:43:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. And the don'ts really pretty practical things like, you got to take a lot of time, this costs you some money, this is real effort, you got to face some things, that's all. That's all kind of hard stuff, right? Am I getting that right? 

00:44:00
UNKNOWN Yeah? 

00:44:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So one observation I want to make is just, that, all of that difficult stuff you're coming and facing and being here tells me something and that is that you love your daughter a lot, to put yourself through this. Is that fair? 

00:44:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:44:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So that's our foundation. We have a very strong and determined child, who might be actually a little bit like her mom. And we've got a mom who loves her daughter so much that she's taking the resources and the risks involved in, in getting some counseling. Is that fair? 

00:44:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:44:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:44:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is this a good example of reframing? 

00:44:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. I think it really worked out well and she gave me some great opportunities. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:44:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, in that… In the vignette what kind of reframes did you use? Yeah. 

00:45:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, the first one and it's a very common reframe. It's not like I'm brilliant on this, but she has this daughter who can throw amazing tantrums, they last for hours, they are really big tantrums. Well, what's under a tantrum? And you know it's so interesting. Parents are sometimes so stressed that, that their reframe is their child is possessed. Child from the devil, they don't know. And so it's really important to start pulling that frame apart in whatever ways you can. So with this young mom, I just said, you know, maybe it's strength and persistence you're seeing. And started to, you know, I even said umm… something like, she's a gifted tantrum. So that was the first reframe and often one that you use with children that are driving their parents crazy. Umm… and then the second one is one that umm… I feel very deeply, is true. We ask a lot of parents in our culture and they are not of lot of supports out there and they have to go out there and find in themselves sometimes and, and she's doing that and she's exhausted. And she's… She doesn't have enough money and doesn't have enough time and she's seeing herself framed as desperate and without resources and at her wits end. And all I did was, capture all of that and say, that tells me you love your daughter a lot. So reframe the desperation into this intense love and you could see her kind of, wow, yeah, I do. 

00:46:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, you, you kind of shared her this alternative reality that there may be something, you know, in the background that you have emphasized that and that, now it comes front and center. So you emphasize kind of the motivation to, to make things better, but you're also emphasized… 

00:46:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But it was there. 

00:46:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:46:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Pull that forward and all of the tension and, and sacrifice it, let that recede a little bit… You know, yeah, exactly. 

00:47:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I mean, that, those messages of her maybe not being good enough parent were all you emphasized, the other part her being, being a loving mother. 

00:47:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh-huh… 

00:47:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:47:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:47:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It's just a typical way in which you work? 

00:47:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… Yeah. Well, especially with parents. But I think reframing and adolescents because uh… We so often lock down on a story. Our narrative is, this is the way it is and that's why they bump me in the hall and that's why I never get a raise. And… So finding another way to see… You know, you don't really debate the facts. Facts are the facts. You don't… And you don't insist on your reframe, but you're sort of… Oh, what feel us a little bit different? What if that actually meant this? Umm… So, yeah, I think I, I do use reframe a fair amount. 

00:47:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. Okay. Why don't we move on to our next skill which is the use of an Empty-Chair or Two-Chair Dialogue? 

00:48:05
Assessment Strategies 

00:48:05
Empty-Chair or Two-Chair Dialogue 

00:48:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So this next technique apparently has two names. Are there two ways of doing it? 

00:48:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. I was always confused by that in grad school, is like, the two chair and the empty chair and… Well, there's two or empty, you know? And actually they are slightly different. 

00:48:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… But I think they both started with the same underlying principle that you are going to bring uh… an aspect of the self into the room, you're gonna personify or you're gonna bring someone into the room who couldn't possibly be there to have a dialogue. So two-chair… Lesley Greenberg talks about it as a dialogue between two conflicting parts of yourself. Umm… I don't think it has to be conflict, it can be exploratory as well. Umm… empty chair, you don't actually ask the client to physically move into the other chair, but you describe who or what is in that other chair and ask them to talk to him. So it still requires that talking to empty space, but the client has to generate things a little differently. 

00:49:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So the two Chair dialogue is kind and maybe, so stayed with E.F.T. in which the client might move in and out of a different kind of chairs. And maybe the empty chair is, I think, more so associated with like to stilt, uh… and which they are bringing something in, into the space. This sounds like, either ways, they are just parts. 

00:49:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. Yeah, that's the common ground. Yep. 

00:49:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Do you re-fill in front of the voices? 

00:49:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN No. I think that's an interesting. You know, you've, you will definitely feel the urge to do that and you're helping clients to teach, but no… Umm… If you did that, it would be a different technique. 

00:49:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:49:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You'd be stepping in. But I do whisper and say, well, tell me this or ask that or… You know, prompting and, and helping and supporting… 

00:50:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:50:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah but being the other voice snuff. 

00:50:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So you don't, you don't, don't speak for the other kind of chair or the other kind of presence or their part, but you almost might coach the client, while they are in one of those chairs. 

00:50:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. My alliance is with the client. I'm not part over there, but I'm might coach or help. 

00:50:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So that seems really critical, but the alliance is with the client and where the client using this technique. 

00:50:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:50:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh… any client attributes that would kind of encourage you to use this technique or maybe not use it? 

00:50:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. You know, umm… I think, one descriptor I would use for the kind of clients I think I would use it with. Our clients who are looser. 

00:50:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:50:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… if you have a client who is very worried and up tight maybe about their own persona in the world, I might not ask them to take that apart until we've gone further in counseling or maybe never. But if the person is uh… sort of full of life and a little bit imaginative, verbal, you sense that they could get into it and, and if the conflict or the thing needing explored clearly has, it's sort of like this inside of them and, and needs that expression. 

00:51:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:51:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:51:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, I know that when you see a technique like this, you know, it's, I might look odd. And sometimes when you introduce to a client, it kind of says, odd. You know, talk to do this chair and these kinds of things. And so, what you said a moment ago really makes a lot of sense as you have to have a client who maybe has the ability to kind of look at a chair and imagine someone there or begin to kind of see themselves as parts and, and that's, so they can make that kind of leap or the creativity umm… Yeah. 

00:51:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And, and not be threatened by it. 

00:51:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Not be threatened. 

00:51:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And I, I probably would not use it with anyone, with any delusional uh… disorders because I think you don't want to encourage the conversation. You need to be aware. 

00:51:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Umm… In a moment we're gonna see you work, work with Jenny. Uh… Can you tell us about kind of this, this role play anything we need to know? 

00:52:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, Jenny is a second year graduate student in counseling and uh… It's kind of cool because her institution provides eight free sessions a year. And I think that's awesome when we encourage trainees to do some work themselves. And she has taken full advantage last year. She went and umm… joined a a smoking cessation group at the house service and quit smoking and successfully. But umm… she is back for another round and has some uh… heavy duty self-improvement in mind. So we'll see that. 

00:52:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. And so, and our viewers then kind of look for kind of the parts of Jenny that she kind of wants to kind of speak to or kind of explore deeper and then how you begin to set up and invite her into this technique. 

00:52:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. Where do you… Where do you find that spot where you can suggest the technique and how do you set it up. Yeah. 

00:53:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. 

00:53:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Hi, Jenny. 

00:53:00
JENNY Hi. 

00:53:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So session number two. I remember from last session you were really excited about making some changes that you had in mind. And we agreed we'd get started on those today. 

00:53:15
JENNY Yeah. 

00:53:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:53:15
JENNY So I like, stopped smoking a year ago and that's great and everything, but now I go to the grad school, I'm sure, just all of the time, so I'm over eating on my stress and I don't have time to go to gym, so I've gained all this weight. And I don't have time to do my hair or get a good wardrobe, anything like that and it's just extremely frustrating, and… 

00:53:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You're very frustrated. 

00:53:35
JENNY Yeah. 

00:53:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:53:35
JENNY Like, you need to just fix me. 

00:53:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:53:40
JENNY I mean, well, you've heard that like joke, like, how many counselors does it take to change a light bulb, only one, but it has to want to be changed. Yeah. 

00:53:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. That's, that's the joke. All right. So, and I do. I hear some overall desire on your part. You do want to change and you want me to help you get fixed if possible. 

00:53:55
JENNY I, I mean, I really do want to change. I do, but, I don't know. 

00:54:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I see a funny little grimace there. 

00:54:10
JENNY It just seems like a lot of extra work. 

00:54:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So you do want to change and here a tiny bit of ambivalence. Is that… 

00:54:20
JENNY Yeah. I mean, no, I mean, because I do want to change. 

00:54:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:54:20
JENNY I do. 

00:54:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I do. You do. 

00:54:25
JENNY It's just when I think about it more. 

00:54:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So there's a very strong part of me that saying, I do, I do want to change. I'm here. I'm here in counseling. And I'm hearing this little other part that's maybe saying, not so sure. Is that fair? 

00:54:40
JENNY Yeah, that's fair. 

00:54:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So I have a technique that I'm gonna see how you'd feel about doing. It's call a two-chair and sometimes call empty chair. Have you… Have you guys… 

00:54:50
JENNY Yeah. Yeah, they showed it in school and… Yeah. 

00:54:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So you've, you've seen it done or talked about it. Umm… Have you ever done it? 

00:55:00
JENNY No. 

00:55:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So how would you feel about giving it a try? 

00:55:00
JENNY Give it a try. What's there to lose. 

00:55:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That's true. Yeah. All right. Go on. All right. I'm just gonna get the chair here next to you. It's really pretty simple sort of instructions. I want part of you that wants to change to be in the chair you're in. And then I'm gonna ask you to tell this other part of you, that maybe, you know, doesn't quite want to change. There's something struck or not wanting. So first you tell that part of yourself, about wanting to change. Sort, sort of like telling me. But then the trick is, I'm gonna have you move over there and have her talk to you. 

00:55:45
JENNY Okay. 

00:55:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, both Jenny, Jenny 1 and Jenny 2. So does that make sense as an instruction? 

00:55:50
JENNY Yeah. 

00:55:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You feel like you can do it? 

00:55:50
JERRY I think so. 

00:55:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Little strange but… 

00:55:55
JENNY Well, I try it. 

00:55:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Give it that… Give a try. 

00:55:55
JENNY Okay. Shall I start this one or this one? 

00:55:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, start where you want, but I'm assuming you're… 

00:56:00
JENNY I want to be in this one. 

00:56:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:56:05
JENNY Okay. Yeah. Okay. So this one doesn't want to change, right? Okay. 

00:56:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So just tell her about wanting to change. 

00:56:10
JENNY I… Is it like she should change or I should change? 

00:56:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, that's a good question. And when this works kind of pull it all back together. But, right now you want to change, she doesn't want to change. So you're telling her about wanting to change. 

00:56:25
JENNY Okay. 

00:56:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:56:25
JENNY So I really want to change. I really want to change. Umm… I've gained all this weight, like, my hair is a mess, like, I don't have any time for anything. It's just… It would… There's really no corns to it, to think about it. Like, going to gym, yeah, I may take some time, but like, what's the bad part about losing weight? Nothing. You look better, you feel better, there's no, there's no bad part to loosing weight. 

00:56:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay, try, try and be Jenny 2. Now answer her. 

00:56:50
JENNY Okay. 

00:56:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Tell her why, what's the problem. 

00:56:55
JENNY 2 Well, Jenny, you're gonna fail. Like, let's be honest. You've never accomplished anything. You barely quit smoking. And that took for ever. And you're just gonna feel bad about yourself. You're gonna go to the gym, maybe once, then look around it, all the attractive people working out and you're not gonna feel like that. So why even bother? 

00:57:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Nice. Nice work. Okay, now, that Jenny, that wants to change. Talk with her about that. 

00:57:20
JENNY I mean, I get what you're saying, but I just want to try. Like, I don't see what's wrong in wanting to try something new. Like, yeah, if I fail, I fail, but at least I try, otherwise I'm just stuck and I'm unhappy. So I don't know why you're so against me going to the gym because I think it could be helpful. 

00:57:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN How do you feeling about her? 

00:57:45
JENNY I don't like her very much. 

00:57:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:57:45
JENNY She's kind of rude. 

00:57:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You want to talk to her about that? 

00:57:50
JENNY Talk to her about… Umm… Yeah, like I don't appreciate you being so negative. I don't know why you are… I mean, this is… It's my life and I want to do what's best for me and I don't know why you're so against bettering ourselves. I mean, maybe… Are you scared of change? Because, I mean, change is scary but it can be for the better. And I don't see the harm in trying. 

00:58:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Do you have an answer? You want to go and tell this Jenny about her? 

00:58:20
JENNY 2 I mean, this is hard. Umm… 

00:58:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It is… 

00:58:30
JENNY 2 Yeah, change has never worked out for us. So I don't know why you want to change. Like, just stay who you are. Like, yeah, maybe you're little extra overweight, but you're in grad school, like things happen. Umm… I… I just think like you have too much high expectations of yourself. Like, to add, working out on top of everything you're already doing. It just doesn't seem realistic. 

00:58:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So which chair do you want to sit in? 

00:58:55
JENNY I want… I want this one. Oh, can I get a third chair actually? 

00:59:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I hear. Yeah. 

00:59:00
JENNY Yeah. 

00:59:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So did you hear over in that chair? 

00:59:10
JENNY My mom. Yeah. Uh… She's always like, every time I call her… Ever since I was little, she's always told me like, you're gonna fail at things that I won't even try. And I think even going to grad school, that's still a shock to her. Like, I don't think she expects me to… 

00:59:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN There's a little voice in there that sounds a lot like mom. 

00:59:30
JENNY Yeah. 

00:59:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:59:30
JENNY Yeah. 

00:59:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. How about over here? Is this somebody familiar? 

00:59:35
JENNY Umm… Yeah, I guess like my third grade teacher, Mrs. David. She like always believed in me and she's kind of like, I guess my surrogate mom. When my mom wasn't supportive, she always was the one to tell me that I could do it. And uh… she's actually helped me pay for school. Umm… yeah, which is really, really generous. 

00:59:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Being supported. 

00:59:55
JENNY Yeah, because my mom refused to, because she thought I would fail, so I waste all that money. 

01:00:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. So you feel kind of… Like you got to live up to something over here and live down to something over here? 

01:00:05
JENNY Yeah. 

01:00:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So it seems like, maybe we could work a little bit on that ambivalence and lay some ground work for some of the changes, maybe in a, in a realistic way, maybe not on steroids, that maybe not giving up. So it sound like a reasonable approach? 

01:00:20
JENNY Yeah. 

01:00:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN How did it feel to, to kind of pop in and out of those chairs? 

01:00:25
JENNY I mean, it was weird but it was also kind of empowering, like, to be able to kind of yell at that negative part of myself. And it also made me like, think about where this, this part was coming from. I mean, that was kind of challenge. Well, why does she think that way? 

01:00:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. So a little inside into… You know, where's that… Where's that drag backwards coming from? Yeah. 

01:00:50
JENNY Yeah. 

01:00:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, it gives us something to work on. 

01:00:50
JENNY Yeah. 

01:00:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Definitely. 

01:00:50
JENNY You could say that, yeah. 

01:00:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:00:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, Rita, you barely got started with Jenny and you went right ahead with this rather risky technique. 

01:01:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It's true. It's true. Umm… I don't mean to be contradictory. But it was just the second session and this is a technique that's got some risk involved. In my favor, Jenny is in the field. She's a second year. She has seen the technique and heard about it from legitimate sources. So it didn't seem as flaky as it might you, a person off the street. And she just… She so verbal. And, and so, so wanting to change but there's definitely some deep ambivalence and I could feel it in the room. It was… It seemed likely that she go forward and, and she did. She was a great sport about it. And I think it set a foundation for where we'll work from, from here on out. 

01:01:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It sounds like you, you made, you made that assessment though kind of early on, that this was a client who this was indicated for, or, or that, that she could handle this away and it be helpful. 

01:01:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. Right. Intellect, psychological mindedness, some of those things we talked about. Yeah. 

01:02:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And then he said it, what she end up doing was unpacking kind of these other aspects of who she is. And so on, this way setting like two-chair one technique like this is like disputing, kind of troubling or negative thoughts and… 

01:02:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And, you know, she really went. She… Well, she had trouble moving over to the chair that doesn't want to change. She… 

01:02:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is that typical? I mean… 

01:02:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Probably. 

01:02:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:02:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… although sometimes people leap to the other chair because they want to give goody two shoes, they are good talking to. So uh… but I, I do think that the dominant, the presenting desire is the, is the comfortable chair. 

01:02:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:02:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And then trying to give voice to whatever is holding you back is a little more tricky. She jumped into it. She was able to say, well, you know, things that we all say to ourselves. You're fat slob, you're stupid, you're not gonna succeed, why get out there and risk it? You know those kinds of statements. Umm… but she was so good at it. I went ahead with another sort of advance strategy and asked her. Well, wow, who, who does that sound like? Who are… Who's in those chairs? Umm… And she could go right to it and I know that's the work we'll be doing now. She went right to the source of the ambivalence and the source of the drive. And I think she might have even asked me if there was a third chair, you know, so… 

01:03:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And this is a technique about insight and so it's, the insight is not only the thoughts that we have. It sounds like… It sounds like uh… these attitudes towards ourselves that might come from other people, from our past or and then you know, I want to have… As we again have that dialogue with those parts or the people from our past. How does that lead to change their insight? 

01:03:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, in this case umm… I think what she will work on is, I wouldn't be surprised if she decides she wants to actually do some work on her real relationship with her mom. 

01:04:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:04:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN The insight is that she has absorbed some messages in her family and in, people who believe in her and they are, and they are both difficult messages to, to live out. And I think in this case, these insights or have external components and she may decide to work on those. In other situations, it's more internal. I mean, keep the dialogue going until you at least achieve a truce. 

01:04:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:04:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But, you know, she didn't really realize how ambivalent she was. She, she knew there was a little pocket there. I, I amplified it with the two chair. 

01:04:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. And that ends up being apart insight about that ambivalence. 

01:04:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

01:04:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So that's where she is. 

01:04:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:04:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. Why don't we move to our next skill which is confrontation? 

01:04:55
Assessment Strategies 

01:04:55
Confrontation 

01:05:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So this next skill is being confronted or confrontation. Umm… that doesn't necessarily have a very positive connotation for most people. I doubt most people want to be confronted. 

01:05:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Now I think you're right. I certainly don't. And I also think, really, not many people relish confronting. It's… If you do it well and you umm… It's, it's actually kind of hard. And so umm… it doesn't have a positive connotation at the lay level. And, and even in counselling, I think it's a technique that's umm… a little bit more difficult. But I do want to talk about the definition in counseling. It is simply a reflection. Or a statement that you make to the client, that is noticing discrepancies. 

01:05:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:05:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It has no condemning, no harshness is necessary. In fact it's contra indicated. It's noticing the discrepancies. 

01:05:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it's not in your face confrontation that we might expect, you know, kind of on television or scream on someone's face, right. 

01:06:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Exactly. Yeah. You know, it's, it's not like that at all. And you know, I think historically it has been associated with umm….with a kind of harshness. And in the addictions field, Miller and Rollick, uh… some of the current authors have pointed out there's, there's just like no evidence that harshness increases the efficacy of, of confronting. Umm… and I, in my own clinical work, I think it probably decreases the light. It just raises resistance. It doesn't really help address the discrepancies, that's just really what we want to help with. 

01:06:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So you're saying that… and I would agree that. I think about confrontation, I often think about addictions and that, that maybe some ways that speaks more to the frustration of, of how difficult it could be, to work that addiction, you know… 

01:06:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That's true. It's a… It's a difficult field. Umm… But I do think that counselors use confrontation across all sorts of domains. There are lot of discrepancies in all of our lives. And sometimes it's helpful to, to glimpse those. 

01:07:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So in this next role play, you're going to work with Megan. Can you talk a bit about kind of what we expect? 

01:07:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, Megan and I have been working together. I think it's the fourth session. She is uh… married to a man named Mark and they are trying to have a child. They married very early. They have been married ten years, you wouldn't guess because she's very young. Umm… And they were married because they got pregnant in high school and tragically the pregnancy came to term and the baby was born dead. So they had that trauma. They stay together and they both have college degrees. And I think they are kind of now… Well, I know they are revisiting the whole notion of their marriage. Umm… she's talked with me extensively about affairs they have had and difficulties through those ten years. They have recently rejoined a local church and they are getting pastoral counseling as well as her work with me. 

01:08:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it sounds like in this clip what we should look for, is kind of how you begin to confront Megan in-session about her experiences and kind of… Okay. 

01:08:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, there's some discrepancies. 

01:08:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:08:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And uh… it, it seems like this is a possibility at this point with her. 

01:08:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:08:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Hey, Megan. 

01:08:25
MEGAN BLESS Hey. 

01:08:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN What would you like to work on today? 

01:08:30
MEGAN BLESS Well, I talk to Pastor Dave and, you know, I'm just really trying harder to be a good Christian wife. And, you know, I spent all of this time and effort and really put a lot of thought and love into making all these meals for Mark last week. And he didn't even acknowledge it. He didn't even eat one of them. The noodles got all mushy and he just opened a can of soup. 

01:08:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, that must be pretty frustrating? Were both of you would talking with Pastor Dave or did you go… ? 

01:09:00
MEGAN BLESS It was just me this time. Usually we both go, but we really tried to focus on me in being a good Christian wife. 

01:09:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:09:10
MEGAN BLESS Anyway so… So he just opened that can of soup. I got really frustrated. So yesterday I took a piece of stake to work with me umm… because I was talking to James about this new sauce that I was trying out. He's really excited about it. And it was so nice because for once, somebody was excited about my cooking. And he noticed my efforts and my own husband can't. 

01:09:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Wow. You sound pretty frustrated. 

01:09:30
MEGAN BLESS I'm very angry. 

01:09:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, very angry. Yeah. Yeah. 

01:09:35
MEGAN BLESS And he just went off on me this morning actually, because… Okay. So the doctor called to change his appointment, his fertility appointment. 

01:09:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Oh, yeah. 

01:09:50
MEGAN BLESS And I was so busy with cooking that I forgot to write it down, I forgot to give him a note and I felt bad about that. So he went to the appointment this morning and the doctor wasn't there. And he just let me have it. And it's like, I'm sorry, but you're not noticing what I am doing for you. 

01:10:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So he's gonna get some fertility test. It sounds like that's part of the work that you're doing around trying to get pregnant. 

01:10:10
MEGAN BLESS Yeah. Yeah. You know, we're thinking about having a baby. And I am still on the pill because like, six months ago I went off of it and it was just a complete ordeal, it was awful. I got bloated. I got a pimply leg. My entire body was aching. It was the worst. So I'm just not gonna do that again, especially if there's gonna be a problem with the sperm count. 

01:10:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So, Megan, umm… I just wanted to check in with you and ask your permission to give you a little bit of feedback. We've been talking last few sessions about these issues and umm… I have some observations that I'd like to share with you, but only if you feel like that would be okay? 

01:10:55
MEGAN BLESS Yeah, that's okay. 

01:10:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Are you sure? 

01:10:55
MEGAN BLESS Uh-huh… 

01:10:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So when I'm hearing is, on one hand umm… you've overtly told me and, and others that you're trying to have a baby, you want to have a baby and you want to have a good marriage with Mark. And on the other hand umm… you're on birth control and you kind of forgot to tell Mark about that appointment change. And I feel like, maybe there's a chance you're not as sure as you're telling me you are about actually having a baby and the relationship with Mark. 

01:11:40
[sil.] 

01:11:45
MEGAN BLESS Well… Hard to think about. 

01:11:50
[sil.] 

01:11:55
MEGAN BLESS Yeah. I mean… I guess I just thought that it was what God wanted us to do. I mean… 

01:12:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You're trying hard. 

01:12:05
MEGAN BLESS Yeah. 

01:12:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And sometimes it's so hard to have mixed feelings about something and that's really, really hard to carry the weight of pretending. 

01:12:20
MEGAN BLESS Oh, my gosh, that's it. You know they say and if that you actually make it, right? 

01:12:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, I think they say that but I don't, I don't think that's the way they mean it in terms of pretending you want something that you actually don't, that's just too hard on people. Do you think it would be possible for us to work together on exactly that the ambivalence that you feel, the pushes and the pulls, instead of just, you know, charging forward with the assumption you do want to have a child with Mark? 

01:13:00
MEGAN BLESS Okay. 

01:13:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Is it possible? 

01:13:00
MEGAN BLESS Sure. 

01:13:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Kind of establish footing that feels a little bit more honest to yourself. 

01:13:05
MEGAN BLESS That sounds good. 

01:13:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You're okay with that? 

01:13:10
MEGAN BLESS Yeah. 

01:13:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That's really brave. 

01:13:15
MEGAN BLESS That's why I'm here. 

01:13:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:13:15
MEGAN BLESS Thank you. 

01:13:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:13:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So I'm wondering if this is pretty typical for you in terms of how you confront people in counseling? 

01:13:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:13:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:13:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Or any other place. 

01:13:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Any other place, yeah. 

01:13:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Now, and when I confront other places, I'm not quite as nice. I make a point to ask permission. It's, it's really important. I think it sets the stage too. It's… So, so, yeah, I, I think it's important to introduce the idea that you're gonna say something that's not going to be easy to hear. 

01:13:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:13:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And you do that by, by asking permission leaning forward. Can I, can I share something with you? You're, you're kind of underlining it. 

01:13:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, Rita, I was thinking that, you know, uh… based on what you've told us about the way you work already, about the things that are important to you and the things that you try to embody and kind, kind of show to your client and, and create with your clients that, that your version of confrontation, you know, again would be the stereotypical one, it would be one in which would come to be built on, on, on kind of trust and compassion. And, but the same time, you are gonna be pointing out some type discrepancy and I know it's the, in the session, even though it was pretty gentle, you know, it is a heavy challenge. You know, to someone, about whether or not they want have a baby or not. 

01:14:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:14:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:14:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, and I felt it. It, it, it is a heavy challenge. 

01:14:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:14:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But, you know, I had a lot of evidence for it. Umm… and in previous sessions, she, her ambivalence showed. Umm… she is telling me, she wants to get pregnant, but she is also one birth control. 

01:14:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:14:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And she "accidentally forgot to tell Mark that the fertility appointment had changed" and that caused some controversy and they're just struggling. Umm… and she has this notion that a baby is what she's supposed to do, but I don't think her heart's in it. 

01:15:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you stepped in this idea that she was pretending umm… and she kind of went along with that. And as I was pretending it was what she was supposed to do. 

01:15:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

01:15:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:15:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, she had picked up. I don't… I don't know of any addiction. We have not worked on addictions, but she suddenly popped up with that. Oh, yeah, they say ANA, fake it till you make it. Which, I just felt like, oh, fake that you want to have a baby until you get pregnant? Wow! You know, I didn't say that to her, but I thought that underlined this really deep ambivalence about this. 

01:15:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. 

01:15:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:15:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, it seem like Megan was drawing some regains from AA and from her ideas about, "what might be God's will? Or, or, kind of what it means to be a Christian? Umm… 

01:15:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, she's struggling with that and of course, you know, she's there getting the, the pastoral counseling. And one thing that's really important… Well, we all, we all have philosophical religious doctrines that we believe in or most of us do. And we know darn well that we do not live up to them. So it's a really rich area for discrepancies. But uh… and, you know, I, I think feminist Christians might watch that clip and go, oh, there's nothing in the Bible about cooking good meals or maybe there is, I don't know. But, the point is, we are not religious authorities. And so we let the client… That's not something we would confront. If, if the client needs to explore those dimensions of how it plays out in their life, then they need authorities trained in, in religious counseling or Christian counseling. It should be part of the informed consent and it should be the setting should allow for that. So I don't think we observe discrepancies in people's faith systems. 

01:16:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. It sounds think it's more looking at that discrepancy, that she's presenting in the session with you based on kind of how she's viewing her life and living her life and what she's kind of, kind of presenting to you, is what she wants to work on. 

01:17:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, and umm… I could. And in fact in my own life, I've had counselors say to me. You might want to check your facts on that. So that's as far as you're, you're asking her to go back and check what the Bible might have to say, but you're not gonna be an authority on it. 

01:17:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. Okay. Why don't we move on to our next skill, which is the "the use of Self-Disclosure?" 

01:17:35
Assessment Strategies 

01:17:35
Self-Disclosure 

01:17:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON This next skill is one that, that might surprise people, particularly because this is a program about, about insight. Uh….because most counselors realize they must be careful about self disclosing. But is it also considered an insight technique? 

01:17:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Well, I consider it one. And I think it can produce insight. So I guess it qualifies. Yeah, I think, you know, in graduate school you remember, the shock that you're not supposed to self disclose, you're not supposed to enter personal question. 

01:18:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

01:18:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That, that's all part of managing the, the counseling relationship. Students just, just like, what, I can tell them what kind of… That I drive a Ford too? Nope. Nope, no. So, yeah, disclosure is part of counseling and sometimes we do self disclose. And the students hate it when I say you need to tell me why you're self-disclosed. You need to… You need to be able to calibrate your self-disclosure in service of the therapy relationship. 

01:18:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:18:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:18:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So there are times and reasons in which, which you self-disclose for insight. It sounds like that? 

01:18:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. 

01:18:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Can you talk about kind of what those might be? 

01:18:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, umm… I'm going to talk about one, uh… one type of self disclosure that's fairly common in the literature. It's been around for quite a while and it's called immediacy. 

01:18:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. 

01:19:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And I think of it as hearing now. 

01:19:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:19:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… which is also uh… an important aspect of group work. 

01:19:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Sure. 

01:19:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… but it's, it's bringing, the hear now reactions of mine, my guy, into the room in a way that I'm hoping will facilitate inside in the, in the client. So it, it might be supportive or comforting. It might just be… An observation I've made that is uh… almost complimentary. 

01:19:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:19:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… and sometimes it can be uh… confrontational. 

01:19:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Umm… Can you say more about that last one, when, when it's, it's confrontational? 

01:19:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, I'm just gonna use Carl Rogers because everything is so nice. Umm… He wrote about sharing in the moment with a uh… young man he was working with that the guy was boring him. And that's, you know, that's pretty hard to hear from your counselor. You're really boring. He didn't do it that way. 

01:20:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

01:20:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN He did his usual. You know, it's unusual for me and, and I don't know what you'll make of this. 

01:20:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON But I'm sure if he did it, it sound like, somehow like a compliment. 

01:20:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Almost, not really. 

01:20:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:20:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But the boring young man uh… was able to have some insight into his boringness and, and work on it. So the confrontation aspect of it worked, but it doesn't always have to be confrontation. 

01:20:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it sounds like, like you heard you back said, there's… When you're thinking about insight, there's a reason why you're doing this. It's a thoughtful reason why you're doing. 

01:20:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. And usually it's to facilitate, the client seeing something in a different way or peeling back a little layer of, of unconsciousness. 

01:20:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So in a moment we're gonna watch you kind of, kind of show self disclosure. And I wonder if you can set up this clip. 

01:20:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, I've worked with this young man uh… for actually, I think it's 11th session. It's a tough situation. He was boating with his father and his brother. The boat turned over and he was able to swim to shore with great difficulty, but the brother and the father drowned. 

01:21:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:21:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So he is filled with survival guilt, a survivor guilt, sorry and umm… and just trauma and grief. And so we've worked. He's just been delightful to work with, but also of course a very sad situation. 

01:21:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:21:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So what's happening is umm… he's been able to go back to work. He… He's kind of run out of sessions. And uh… he also can't get away during the day and I don't work in the evenings. And so there's just starting to be reasons that it's time for him to work in some new ways. 

01:21:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:21:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So last session I suggested, he think about joining a really nice grief group that's in town and that would be available to him. And so that's what, that's what we're gonna work on. 

01:21:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. And so it sounds like the viewers then will kind of look for the smaller self disclosure that, that you're making and how, how it leads to insights? 

01:22:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. Yeah. 

01:22:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. 

01:22:05
ROBBIE Rita, so I remember last weekend you had mentioned like the group that, the peer group. And I was thinking about it, but I'm just kind of… Oh, and I'm just not too sure about it right now. 

01:22:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Oh, I will… Like you've been thinking about that, Robbie, you know, making that suggestion came from the fact that, I know it's hard for me to get here during the day and we've been meeting pretty steadily. And so uh… I think… You know, it might be something to consider and, and I'm glad you given a little thought. 

01:22:40
ROBBIE Yeah, I mean… I'm giving a little bit of thought because lately it's been, it's been kind of hard. it's been like the sixth month anniversary since it happened. And I just, I can't believe that six months have gone past already. 

01:22:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. You know, with grief time expands and shrinks and it, it never feels quite normal. It's, it's definitely part of the grieving process to feel like, it's really long ago and really just yesterday. 

01:23:10
ROBBIE Yeah. No, I… I thank you, you really like that a lot. And, you know, you say, like all these things that, it feel so, you know, so significance faculty to me. And, I mean, that's gonna happen in the group? 

01:23:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… So that's sort of what you've been questioning, it sounds like, like the transition and, and, umm…. You know, would it be all right I just shared something with you umm… that, that I've been feeling in myself? Umm… I feel like we've really done some pretty deep work together. And I have to tell you, I, I feel a little bit protective of you making that transition to group. I feel a little nervous about the transition for you, a little, a little protective. 

01:24:00
ROBBIE Well, that was… Yeah, I mean, it's kind of… It's kind of nice to know that you kind of worry about me. Umm… I just… I'm worried about the group and I'm worried that umm… It's not gonna be helpful. I'm pretty scare, it's not gonna be helpful. And then I won't know what to do because and I won't have you. 

01:24:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So if we make a plan that kind of includes some of our fears and concerns. Umm… Maybe we could stretch out the sessions that you still have left with me and you could try the group, couple three weeks give it a try and, and be honest with yourself about the fears and transitions. And then we could schedule a check in session and, and kind of taper down that way and address some of the fears and, and concerns. How would you feel about that? 

01:24:50
ROBBIE You know, that, that sounds pretty good, that sounds pretty good. Yeah, I just, you know, it's awful. It just like this bad dream and I kind of wish it was… I kind of wish it was a bad dream and it wasn't real. 

01:25:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, it's so, it's so hard to incorporated in to, into your life and see how to go on. I kind of wish it was a bad dream too. Yeah. 

01:25:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh….Wow, I mean, that's a tough situation for, for the client here. I mean, I think, anyone watching that probably would, would feel really sad. And it's interesting how you yourself became somewhat protective of him, I saw, and but you were able to share that. 

01:25:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:25:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:25:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, that was kind of the whole thing that umm… I had… The clients that are so willing to work and have such sad situations, I think, they, they just, you can't help it, they go home and you think about them. And so I knew when I suggested the group. Umm… I could feel myself feeling nervous for him and protective and… But that's one thing sharing that with the client is a completely different thing. So it was a very conscious choice because he came in and he's willing… He right away says, I've been thinking about that group. Um… but then, you know, he's got a little bravado to it. And then he's a little hesitancy and he's… And then he kind of compliments me on how, how good it feels to be in counseling with me. And, you know, there was a lot of parallel process. I wanted to say, yeah, you're ruining the plan too. Umm… So the immediacy, the sharing was, you know, I feel kind of nervous, I feel protective of you. And the implication was that, that he feels that way too and it's okay for us to talk about that and, and it led to that, we did. 

01:26:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, I was thinking that, you know, he was also talking about, about grief and loss and, you know, those are experiences that, that are universal for all humans. And, you know, I wonder if there's any moment that sharing your own losses might be appropriate to the client? 

01:27:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, the feminist in me of course uh… says, yeah, of course. But I, I don't think it's often the case that clients want to hear about our losses. They… We can share him as explanatory if it touched your nerve and we start tearing up a little bit. Uh… but they are not there to comfort us. So often it's much better to share in that immediacy sense, how sad there loss is making you feel as well. So that kind of immediacy, but… umm… I think often, it's better not to share your own loss. Uh… but sometimes it will affect you in that, in that session and sometimes you might. 

01:27:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It sounds like, you know, if your guidance here was really awareness of kind of a here and now experience. What you're experiencing with that client in that moment? You know, and that was part of the decision process to share that with him. 

01:27:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

01:28:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:28:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Exactly. 

01:28:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right and you're bringing outside thing into it. 

01:28:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, that's a good observation. Yeah. 

01:28:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Why don't we move to, to our final skill which is the skill of interpretation? 

01:28:15
Assessment Strategies 

01:28:15
Interpretation 

01:28:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is interpretation is something that counselors commonly do? 

01:28:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… That's a good question. I, I think that they do. I'm not sure that they know what they are doing sometimes. Umm… But uh… interpretation is a fairly counselor centric technique. So… Yeah, I think, I think they do, do them and I think we could have a better understanding of them sometimes. 

01:28:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:28:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:28:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Umm… Tell me more about that better understanding? 

01:28:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, most of us I think when we hear the word interpretation think, you know, deep psychoanalytic work. Umm… and the, and it does come from that terminology. It comes out of the early analysts. Umm… And their, their meaning was, they call it the triangle of insight. And, and uh… it had to do with making linkage, bringing unconscious material from conflicts in relationships in early childhood, conflicts incurrent relationships. And then the other one was uh… conflicts that arise from the transference relationship. So that's the, a triangle. 

01:29:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You mark the idea. Do you have, do you have transference and I'm, I'm kind… I'm not sure counselors often work directly with the transference? 

01:29:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It depends. I, I think we… We're certainly aware of it and we uh… experience it. Uh… whether we're trained to actually interpret. 

01:29:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay, to work with it, right? 

01:29:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, I think that requires some specialized training. And also in today's climate uh… it's a, it's a long term process, if you're really gonna work with the core relationship themes uh… via the transference relationship. You need extra skill, extra time, extra money. It's, it's an interesting, but I don't think common umm… direction for counselors. 

01:30:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It sounds like what you're saying to is again with that, that skill of interpretation under the umbrella of kind of insight oriented that, that's how it could be used, to explore the transferences. 

01:30:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, you don't need all, all of the legs of the triangle to actually do what we would now call an interpretation. Yeah. 

01:30:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And you're also saying the idea of, of interpretation maybe it's beyond this notion of it, just being psychodynamic. 

01:30:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes, it absolutely. 

01:30:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:30:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. The interpretation is uh… involves linking conflicts or other unconscious material that you are… You've put the case together that there's some linkage that the client has not yet seen. And so you're interpreting the conflict, but often now do what I call a trial interpretation, a baby interpretation. 

01:31:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:31:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… just to see how that goes. And that's just noting a relationship here and a relationship here and, and hypothesizing there might be a connection. 

01:31:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. So in a moment we're gonna watch you work. Can you set up this role play for us? 

01:31:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, this is an interesting moment. She's quite, uh… quite out there and has come in uh… talking. The reason she decided to get counseling as she's divorced and has had three intense affairs in less than a year. They have all gone very badly and she has decided there's something there. She can't figure it out. She's come to counseling to figure it out. 

01:31:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it sounds like we're gonna watch then, it's kind of how you use interpretation to, to lead toward some insight. 

01:31:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh-huh… 

01:31:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. 

01:31:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Exactly. Yeah. 

01:31:55
KAYLEIGH SOTO So I ran into Jack this week. 

01:31:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Jack? 

01:32:00
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah. I saw him across campus and he just looked at me with these weird like piercing eyes. And I just got uh… like shivers down my spine. He's not like Mickey and those other guys that I dated. Like, they are all, you know, oh, so messy gushy. Oh, Kayleigh, you're the best. And Jack is just got me in his sights and… uh… 

01:32:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh… he sounds little creepy. 

01:32:30
KAYLEIGH SOTO He's super intense. 

01:32:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. 

01:32:30
KAYLEIGH SOTO And did I even tell you about the weird crap that he would try to make me do sexually? He… It's unspeakable. I don't want to freak you out. So I'm not even gonna tell you what he wanted me to, do but it was too much. And, you know, I heard, I've heard that you have to kiss a lot of frogs to find your prince. But how many frogs are out there? This is getting a little ridiculous. 

01:32:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I want to say that trend in dating is not, not going the positive direction. 

01:33:00
KAYLEIGH SOTO Oh, my gosh all these codes are complete wackos. 

01:33:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:33:05
KAYLEIGH SOTO I can't handle them anymore and not squash them out of the door. 

01:33:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So you've shown… I think three… We've talked about three relationships after the divorce from Tony? 

01:33:15
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah, that was a long time ago though. 

01:33:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. So right now nobody on the scene. 

01:33:20
KAYLEIGH SOTO Now, right now the only crazy relationship that I have to deal with is my little brother Paulie. And he and his wife are coming into town and they made this big deal about wanting to come see me. I hate him. 

01:33:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I don't think we've talked about Paul at all. 

01:33:40
KAYLEIGH SOTO Well, you know, he… My parents just were gaga over him, like he could do no wrong. He got straight A's. He dated all the right people. He was always sweet, except to me and I can't stand him. And now he and his stupid wife are coming into town and she's gonna look at me and say, "Oh, Kayleigh, how are you doing?" And. I can't stand her petty. It's ridiculous. And I, I can't even bring anybody because I'm not seeing anyone to defuse the tension. It's gonna miserable. 

01:34:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, wow, you know, I wanted to share something with you that I've noticed. Is it all right? Just a little observation? 

01:34:20
KAYLEIGH SOTO Sure. 

01:34:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… I have not seen you this emotional or animated. We've talked about the broken relationships and the divorce and some other things, but this whole thing with your brother Kayleighs a kind of intensity that is really kind of up a few notches from usual for you. 

01:34:50
KAYLEIGH SOTO Yeah, up a few hundred notches. My brother and my relationship I mean, uh, it's… I, I can't even describe it to you right now. I just don't like we want to go into it because I, I don't even want to speak his name. 

01:35:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Wow! Wow! So I'm just gonna float a little hypothesis out there for what it's worth. I'm wondering if there might be some connections between this really, really difficult relationship. I'm assuming since childhood with your brother, all the way up till now in some connection to the difficulties you have in some other relationships with other men in your life, do they think? 

01:35:30
KAYLEIGH SOTO No, shit Sherlock. 

01:35:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. So some possible connections there, we don't know what they would be, but I wonder how it would feel to actually work on some of that? 

01:35:45
KAYLEIGH SOTO I mean, I guess, sure, it's worth a shot. 

01:35:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:35:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, Rita, is this a typical way of, of a kind offer interpretation to a client? 

01:35:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, you know, I hope so. It's uh… It's typical in that. It was careful and gentle and tentative and hypothetical because uh… You probably noticed she was a little hostile. 

01:36:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:36:10
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Umm… She's got a little edge to her anyway, but uh… as I began down of the interpretation, we heard like "No shit Sherlock." Umm… I think, it wasn't aggressive toward me, but I, I do think we saw an interpretation, the trial interpretation and I think she's okay with it, but it raised a little, little defensiveness. Umm… and it, it gave me lots of uh… yellow flags. I'm going to go slow. 

01:36:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, I mean, there's, there's a lot there. I mean, there's, there's some material that's connected to her brother and… 

01:36:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. And, you know, he she hates him. And its clear there's a lot of cathected energy around this relationship. Uh… which would lead me to… Of course I'm on my client side, so I'm thinking. Did he sexually abuse or did he…? What happened here or they bad parents? They didn't want their daughter. I don't know any of that. It's… And so for me to leap those directions… All I do know is this is a very emotional relationship for her. And it's likely really that because it's so loaded and, and hot, it's affecting her other relationships. That doesn't seem like a big leap. 

01:37:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. I noticed that you also asked when you offer that tribulation, you asked for her permission as well. 

01:37:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:37:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Uh… Is that typical for you too and… ? 

01:37:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, and you know, I was thinking about that. It's, it's a way to alert the client that something, a little bit challenging is coming or, or uh… It's also a way to get by in, because I've asked permission. It's like, they have said, yeah. Okay, go ahead. So I really have their attention. Umm… It's, it's a way to sort of bracket that. 

01:37:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. I was thinking, you know, when you work with her, you know, you're aware that it's a charged kind of, kind of area and you asked, asked for permission. And as you off that, that interpretation, she, like you said, she kind of, she had some rough edges to it, but that seems like that would, that is very normal and typical for something like this. But again kind of how you set it up again, you know, you weren't gonna ignore it. 

01:38:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

01:38:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And so you're also gonna… You know, if you're gonna get some insight here, it's, it's going to be difficult at times. 

01:38:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right, exactly. 

01:38:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:38:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That was the message. 

01:38:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. So where would you go from here with her? 

01:38:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, I'm hoping that, you know, she is gonna have dinner with, with Paul and Casey and I'll bet fireworks are gonna… I bet we even scheduling another session. I think it's really hot. And uh… she also has accumulated quite a ray of, of past relationships in a pretty short order. So there's a lot of material there. But I'm actually going to go slower than she'll probably even want because it won't do any good if I do the interpreting and I put two and two together for her. 

01:39:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You're doing all the work then. 

01:39:00
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN If I do all the work… Uh… I, I need to help her begin to accept some of, of that affect umm… and, and work with it herself and that's what I'll be aiming for. 

01:39:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, I'm struck with… You know, again this is a charged area. You asked for her agreement to gonna work in that area. Umm… and my hunch is you asked that because you, you, you know there's a connection there or you sense there's a connection there. But what if you reject? What if the club rejects it? Your offers invitation and she rejects it or she rejects it? 

01:39:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN No, you're stupid. That, no way that's connected. Paul is Paul and all these other guys are other guys, not in common at all to, to have an interpretation flat out rejected. And umm… as we talked earlier, it's very important to be a humble counselor. 

01:39:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, I was thinking that. 

01:39:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Or an alternative would be to say, look, I got the PhD and you got nothing, just take it for once worth, baby. Now uh… sometimes inside you're just like want to do that, yourself frustrated, but the, the correct and therapeutic thing is to back off. And, you know, what happens? They go home, they think about it. Many times they come back the next week and say, well, you know, I was thinking about. Maybe there's a chance, Paul and… So it just takes a little time for it to soak in. And, and, and actually sometimes you're wrong. You just need to say, oh, I was, I was wrong, sorry. 

01:40:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. It just reminds us that, you know, not, not be so infatuated with ourselves. 

01:40:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Exactly. 

01:40:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON At times we have these like… Can't you see by great interpretation, you know, and… 

01:40:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah, please. Yeah. 

01:40:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And can you take a step back and realize that, you know, the client, you know…. 

01:40:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Client is the boss. 

01:40:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. 

01:40:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:40:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. You know, Rita, you know, this has been a real informative uh… experience for me. And, you know, certainly insightful for myself to kind of see how you use these techniques, how you kind of uh… apply insight but really, again how you do this, which is how you kind of take these variety of techniques, that really are drawn from across theoretical spectrum, but your embody them in a way that is really true to who you are. Umm… And it's really thoughtful about the clients and really client centered and so I really appreciate that. 

01:41:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, thanks. It was a great opportunity. 

01:41:15
