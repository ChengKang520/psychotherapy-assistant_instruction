CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS I'm Dr. Cyrus Marcellus Ellis, I'm a core faculty member at Governors State University's Counselor and Education Supervision Program. I'm an alumni of the University of Virginia, and the Curry School of Education, and I'm proud to say, I'm a 20 year veteran of United States Army. This is a course on the psychopharmacology of anxiety. Welcome. In the time that we have we're going to try to understand the psychopharmacology of anxiety, and I want to make sure that I emphasize here in the beginning and I'll be talking about it later, the warning pieces that go with this particular realm of psychopharmacology. Anxiety is real, but the pharmacology that we use to treat it come with some particular warnings. So, I want to make sure that I say that upfront, so that I don't leave that out on the backend. So, let's first understand what we're talking about. When we use the term psychopharmacology briefly what we're talking about is the mental state of an individual as they approach the use of particular medications. If you are apprehensive about taking it you might not take it as much, if you are worried about taking it, you might not take it as much. So who you are in the first part of that word psychopharmacology is quite important. Now with pharmacology, we're talking about three basic ideals. A. How the chemistry of a drug is constructed, that's how it's made. Second, its primary use, in this discussion obviously the primary use will be for the treatment of anxiety. Third, and we look at most importantly are the side effects of the medication. It's impact on the body symptoms, systems rather that aren't designed to be affected, but are affected by the chemistry of it, and what that does to the individual. So, the psychopharmacology really means one's approach to taking medication and the construction use and side-effects of that medication. Now when we look at the issue of anxiety, we have to recognize anxiety is a real illness, it is not something that people just throw out kind of nonchalantly or very casually. We use the word, "I'm anxious," maybe at exam time if you're a student or if you are a performer and you have to now perform and you're in front of a live audience, you might have a degree of anxiety, no doubt about that. Even driving on crowded highways or bridges can provoke feelings of being anxious, but anxiety is really beyond that when we talk about it in clinical terms. That's why as a clinician the way we understand the terminology is quite important for assessment of the reason because we just want… we don't want to be as casual as the public is at times with these terms. So, when we look at anxiety, a… a… a good way to remember it in… in clinical terms is to remember that anxiety is a real or it's an imagined fear, a real or imagined fear. And there are some characteristics that go with that. One is this constant worry, it's not that if you have a test on Friday and you're worried about it, you take the test, most people say, I no longer worry about it, it's… it's over, I took the test, it's over. But when you are in the arena of anxiety you are someone who is of constant worry, you're constantly worried about the test, you're constantly worried about something, there's extreme rumination, it just goes over your mind, over and over and over again, you just can't let it go. It's there, it's there, it's there, and it's there, it's not going anywhere. Those characteristics really underscore why anxiety is real as an illness. It will get in the way, what we call debilitating anxiety. It… It will get in the way of your activities of daily living, it will get in the way of, example, of… of your life enjoyment activities for example, if you have a child performing in a play, you begin to be so worried about whatever else going on you don't even notice the play has occurred, you have missed it, you're out checking phones, or you're out checking this and checking that. And everything in front of you goes right by you. So, it's a debilitating type of experience, not just a fact you have this sense of anxiety. So, we remember that it is a real problem. To understand how we then treat anxiety in a basic understanding mind you, is to understand the way our brain operates. The brain is the hub, it is the ground zero of how our body works, it communicates chemically. In our brain are webs of pathways, neurons to be exact that carry messages across our brain, and throughout the rest of our body and… and certainly, there are particular neurochemicals or neurotransmitters that communicate and because our brain is the focal point of all this action, it's the brain that makes it sad… makes us sad, it's the brain that makes us angry, it's the brain that makes us be on our defense, it's the brain that does all of that. So, the neurochemicals that we posses send messages if the brain is operating, what we would call 'normally' that allows us to be anxious when it's time to be anxious, be on guard when it's time to be on guard, or be at rest when it's time to be at rest, if everything is going the way it is designed to work. So these neurochemicals tend to play a role in how we're able to do that. So, we must pay attention then to particular neurochemicals that aid in, or are associated with anxiety. Now we have serotonin for the happy, we have dopamine for the happy as well, but also other functions, and we have nobuprenorphine, citicoline and we have epinephrine, all to aid in the way our body is regulated. The word we like to use on occasion that is when you suffer from anxiety as an illness, you are now in a disregulated state, we have to find a way to balance those issues, so that you then can address the things in your life. Okay. So, one of the things we try to look at is in the area of the neurotransmitter called GABA, or G-A-B-A. G-A-B-A is a neurotransmitter that allows us not to be anxious. Think about this, if you go into an arena, you say a major sporting event, football, baseball, basketball, and you walk in and you see 50,000 plus people, it is your regulated G-A-B-A that allows you not to become overly anxious about that situation, you're able to be social, if only to find your seat and enjoy the game. But in parties, we know people, some of us that are… are a little bit nervous around groups of people. If your GABA or your G-A-B-A is in… it's balanced, then you find yourself being gregarious, or being open, and being social and not having anything debilitating, when you then see it and you run away. That particular neurotransmitter is one that we watch or seek to aid by the pharmacological intervention, so that individuals can address their anxiety. And it's important to remember that the disregulated state, the worry, the ruminations, the excess of worry, the fear, all of those are the outward symptoms of something going on inside in terms of neurochemicals, so that's how as clinicians we… we piece A and B together and come up with our intervention and we say, here's the outside, and we have a medical mind(ph) that kind of explains, well, if they're struggling it's probably because of this imbalance and we seek pharmacologically to intervene. Like anything else, there are classifications of particular pharmaceuticals to aid in the balancing nature of anxiety. And there is a particular class that is used quite often and we call those Benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines is the umbrella term for more name brand medications like, Valium, we've heard of Valium, Xanax, you've heard of Xanax, even Librium for that matter, and a drug that was popular certainly in the '90s, I remember very well was Ambien. So, you have these classifications of drugs and their brand names that go with then, all designed to be ingested. Now what does that mean? When we ingest this medication, it goes into our bloodstream and it's on its way to the brain, to address the G-A-B-A that's in our body systems already. Now this can get a little complicated and believe me there… there is a more (inaudible ) scientific way to address what I'm about to talk about, we will have a basic understanding. In this thing we call neurons, we have what we call the presynaptic neuron, that's going to be my left hand, and it sends all the neurochemicals down to send messages forward. For example like, okay, you can calm down now, a lay way to say it, but that's what's kind of going on, and it's going to release particular chemicals into this thing, we call it a synaptic cleft, it's a little small space between two neurons, it's going to get picked up on my right arm now being called for our example the postsynaptic neuron. Well they're little things who are receptor sites that receive these neurotransmitters and it's in that arena where all the action is taking place with regard to the pharmaceuticals that address neurotrans… that address anxiety. The G-A-B-A receptor has to be modulated, you see. Think about this, the more G-A-B-A that I have, the more I can relax. If I don't have enough G-A-B-A, I tend to be more anxious. And again, we're not talking about, again, a test, I'm getting anxious about taking this test, I want to make sure I do well on this test. We're… We're beyond that which we would call a function of living, we're talking about when you are debilitated, when it gets in the way of things you need to accomplish. So, the more G-A-B-A that I have, the… the less anxious I can be. G-A-B-A is… is a normal neurotransmitter, so the medications that we prescribe is going to modulate G-A-B-A, we call it a, an agonist, fancy phrase for an aid in production of the neurotransmitter chemical known as G-A-B-A. It itself is not G-A-B-A, but it helps G-A-B-A. So, it sets its sites on assisting within the receptor sites the way in which G-A-B-A aids us, that's what the Valium does, that's what the Xanax does, that's what the Ambien does, that's what the Librium does, it helps. So, when you ingest it, it goes into the bloodstream, the bloodstream finds its way to the cleft. It carries the chemical pieces that made Ambien, and Xanax, and all that stuff, and it goes to particular G-A-B-A receptor sites as an agonist, as a helper, to do what, produce more G-A-B-A. So that we can calm down or be less anxious. That part is critically important to understand, that's what the drug's use was for, but that last piece if you recall we make it, and then we know what it's used for, and that last piece is side-effects. And it is in that arena where the pharmacology of anxiety becomes quite important. There is a sedative nature to these kinds of pharmaceuticals and when paired with other sedative drugs like alcohol, this drug becomes quite deadly. It addresses not only the G-A-B-A, but it also addresses and mimics the action of what we call the parasympathetic nervous system. That system by itself is supposed to slow your body down. For example, anxiety gets your blood going, right. It gets your heart rate to increase and you have to do something, even if you don't your body is saying do something, well that's called the sympathetic nervous system, it's autonomic, it means it does everything on its own, you don't have to tell it to do anything, it's going to do that by itself. And the parasympathetic nervous system brings you down, it slows the heart rate, it allows you to go to bed. Well, certain drugs like alcohol and others, they kind of attack the parasympathetic nervous system and so does Benzodiazepines. And so they're trying to aid in what, increasing G-A-B-A so you can be less anxious. What we find is that, that has a sedative effect and some people like that, so they take it. By the way this class of Benzodiazepines are the most prescribed over the last 15 years, there… there has been a lot of people taking Xanax, and Valium, Ambein right now is in trouble, but still these drugs are prescribed in large quantities. So there is a lack of caution that goes into these drugs. And… And… And one of the things that really sets it off is that, is the sedation. That if we take it what we call PRN, or as you need it you're going to get that calming effect relatively quickly and some people like that. Now on the initial ingestion you want the calming effect so you're able to address your daily needs. So, going to the grocery store is not overwhelming, so that going to school is not overwhelming, going to the play, or the PTA meeting won't be overwhelming, you're… you're calmer, the G-A-B-A has risen. But then it goes beyond that because some of the other cautions that I spoke about when we began now finds its way here, you can lose your memory. There is significant memory impairment when you take these drugs on a regular basis, tolerance becomes an issue. Unlike other pharmaceuticals the Benzodiazepines can increase in tolerance in the body. Meaning what, you need more to get the former sedative effect, or calming effect that you had previously, so you'll find yourself taking more, that becomes dangerous 'cause there's an overdose component to Benzodiazepines. There is cautions across the board about mixing Benzodiazepines with other drugs that have sedation as a side-effect. We already talked about alcohol, some of our stars, more people in greater profiles have died because of the mixing of alcohol and the mixing of these types of medications i.e., Benzodiazepines. You can… You can realize that the sense of always having to perform is very anxiety producing, it is something that could worry you excessively. They reach for these kinds of medications to cope with that. But when they drink and have other habits like that, now these two drugs mix, and because they both attack the autonomic nervous system, which is how you breathe, how you are awake, and so forth, you can see how from the biological piece of this conversation, or the pharmacological piece of this conversation, why we find them not waking up, because they do go to sleep, it is the waking up that becomes problematic, and these drugs have that about them. And it's a serious cautionary statement that we have to give to our clientele and why the monitoring of what we do when people are taking this medication is quite important. The pharmacology tells us this drug can increase your G-A-B-A, that allows you to work a little bit better, and be a little bit more productive in your daily life, but the pharmacology also tells us, issues of sedation, memory loss, combination of other drugs can also have you in a dangerous predicament when you consume these drugs. Basi… Mainly because tolerance increases, the body gets used to it, the reward from these drugs do not sustain themselves with the same dosage overtime so you begin to take more and more. That dimension of these drugs really makes the pharmacology of treating anxiety quite serious, it's something that we have to monitor. Are there any questions? 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN I have a question. Umm… How do you know what amount of dosage to prescribe to these patients? 

00:21:30
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS That's a very good question. One of the things that we do in our profession today, that was a slightly different from years pass, is we work with a comprehensive criterion based assessment. What that quickly means is that we have various pieces of a person's life that we tend to assess, one of those areas is a medical examination. So, what I would do, I mean, I'm a non-medically trained person is take in the data on the symptoms, much that we talked about earlier about how much of the excessive worry, how much of it is rumination, where's the debilitation. I then talk to the medical professional, who will do their own assessment mind you, and then they begin, medical professionals have a… a methodology to begin the dosage. They might start 0.2, 0.5 and then see with my assistance if there's a reduction in those symptoms I just talked about. When there aren't any significant cessation of those symptoms when we first met them, they may up the dosage, or give it more time with other treatments involved, psychotherapy, group therapy and things like that. The caution always with Benzodiazepines is we don't want to give so much that we have a sedation effect and don't leave room for actual treatment to make a difference where they help learn skills to address their own anxiety with the aid of the Benzodiazepines and we're also cautionary because these drugs are highly addictive, they can become debilitating all by themselves because of the feelings that the client gets, and the mood that comes over them, but not one where it's profitable for making their life better, they rely on the pill, and that means their tolerance will increase, and that means they become quite addictive. So, it's a combination of the medical personnel's review and our review of their ability to take on the treatments, and take on the interventions that we provide that aids and how we know how much to give.
