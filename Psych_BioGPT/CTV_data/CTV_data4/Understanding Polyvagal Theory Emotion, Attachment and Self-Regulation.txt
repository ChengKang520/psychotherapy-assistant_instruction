RICH SIMON Hello, my name is Rich Simon, I'd like to welcome you to this Networker webcast, Neuroscience in Action. We're exploring the clinical implications of the explosion in our understanding of the brain that's taken place over the last 10 or 15 years, and we're very fortunate to have someone who's often discussed when clinicians are talking about new people who are mapping the brain in ways that are relevant for psychotherapists. My guest today is Stephen Porges. Who's a psychologist by training. 

00:00:50
STEPHEN PORGES Hi Rich. 

00:00:50
RICH SIMON Stephen. Stephen has a background in psychology and developmental, developmental psychology, human development and is associated with the workings of a system that he has mapped and brought to the attention of psychotherapists in an extremely provocative way, the polyvagal system, and we'll be exploring that today. So Stephen, just to start us off, so you're background is in developmental psychology, and at what point and why did you get interested in the functioning of the human brain? 

00:01:25
STEPHEN PORGES Okay, this is a long story, so I don't want take the full hour, but when I was a grad student, this was several decades ago, I was extraordinarily interested in what was going on in the subjective world of people, and psychologists basically would ask people (inaudible ) test, and I entered a new area, which at that time was a new area, it was called psychophysiology, and the agenda of that was to see what you could measure physiologically that would tell you something about the individual, so I started off with measurements of attention, so identify whether people are attending (inaudible ) then move to measures of stress and resilience and a whole variety of other features of capability for physiology, but the real question was that peripheral physiology is there, and how's it linked to the brain? And what, our precamera discussion was really everyone's interested in the brain, but they're interested in the brain, but their interest in the brain doesn't seem to give them much insights into the world, because they're studying the brain, they're not studying how the brain or what I would call the expanded nervous system is regulating our behavior and our bodies, and so my interest has always been in terms of how our nervous system, which includes our brain and our body, talk to each other, talk to, talk and regulate our physiological state. The relevance, this I think is really, I think, the critical point of where we may be going in this discussion, is within the clinical world, very few people talk about a neurophysiology of the behavioral state regulation, yet that is what affects all of us. It affects our relationships with each other, it affects our parenting, it affects our teaching, it affects everything. We are in a world that is so dominated by syntax and linguistics, how and what we say, or what we think, without how we communicate with the (inaudible ), and it's the real issue about how we convey our own physiological feelings to people around us. 

00:03:35
RICH SIMON So that's, that's great, because that's in, it seems to me, what you've captured and this work on social engagement system is understanding how, in addition to language, this wonderful human invention, we have this ability to convey our inner states to each other, and we have this whole miracle of the complexity of human relationship, and it sounds like, if my understanding of your work is that you've provided us a key link to going beyond this idea of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, and what we may have learned in our introductory classes on how to understand human physiology and its relationship to social relationship, and you've filled in a, added a whole dimension to that understanding. 

00:04:25
STEPHEN PORGES Well, I filled it in, and as I filled it in, everything became obvious, much more intuitive. The problem is when we go to school, we basically want to learn difficult things and memorize things, because we feel that knowledge gives us an edge, but the knowledge doesn't always give us a pathway back to reality, or a pathway back to interaction. The interesting part about, even understanding the autonomic nervous system is if you don't conceptualize it as the way it was taught, it's been taught this way for one hundred years, and the way it was taught was that that you have sympathetic and you have parasympathetic, and in a sense, they're doing mortal battle with each other, sympathetic is your killer, your stressers, and the parasympathetic is health, growth and restoration. 

00:05:15
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:05:15
STEPHEN PORGES But in reality, that's not even true, and the systems are not systems that are in balance when they react, they are hierarchically organized, so when a person is freaked out, tightly wrapped and screaming hysterically, we say, "Listen, please sit still, calm down." How effective is that? It's not, and I mean, those of us who are parents who came into this world believing in behavior, believing that we could control behavior independent of physiological state have all failed as parents. It's only when we realize that our major role is life is making other people feel safe and calm, and when they feel safe and calm, then the emerging properties of being a human being start to come out. That's when you see the benevolence, the beauty, the creativity and the boldness. Okay, so back to the simple question. We were taught that there was a parallel combat between sympathetic and parasympathetic. That they were basically equivalent systems, and people had a bias. There were people that were parasympathetically biased, and those that were sympathetic. Those that were sympathetic ones, well, they were anxious, neurotic, perhaps oppositional, reactive. Give them drugs and they'll be like nice people, but that's not the reality. The reality is that there was actually a hierarchy of systems. That hierarchy of systems in that hierarchy literally follow the evolution of vertebrates, and this is where it gets really, really kind of a fun story. Embedded in our own evolutionary history are the keys or the clues of how to regulate our state, how to support our health, how to enable us to be social, how to enable us to be intellectually creative. It's all embedded in our phylogenetic history. So we have to understand what that history was, and it wasn't merely that we are calm people or reactive. We come from a long line of vertebrates, if we go through our genealogy, and the early vertebrates used the parasympathetic nervous system as to support digestion, metabolic activity, but they also used it as a defence system. So when they were challenged, they mobilized, they defecate, they quickened breathing, it's shut down, that's a very primitive system. Then, as vertebrates evolved into boney fish, they start getting a spinal sympathetic nervous system, and now you start seeing this dialectic and sympathetic comparison, but the sympathetics were now more powerful. They could turn off that digestive vagas and inhibit that to move, and of course, we know that if you move alot, in highly anxious, tightly wrapped people who have digestive problems. It's not, it's because the sub darthmatic, this old vagas which has the wonderful role of taking care of our visceral organs is turned off, it can't function because the sympathetics are inhibiting it, but if the sympathetics can't inhibit that to inhibit mobilization, that old vagas circuit will be used as a defensive on, and that's where people basically pass out, or they will defecate out of fear. So we know those two things, but sympathetics will inhibit the digestive vagas, but what came along with mammals, and this is really why we're even having this dialogue, is that we are mammals, and mammals are social, and mammals come into the world needing other mammals to take care of them and interact with them. We're not isolates. Reptiles are isolates, but mammals, or some reptiles, so we have to convey to another that we are safe to come close to, we have to utilize others to help us self-regulate. They have to prove to us that they are safe, and when they do that, they utilize the parasympathetic nervous system. What I'm doing, I just lost you because my video times out, and now I was talking without social engagement. A whole problem. 

00:09:30
RICH SIMON And we all feel so sunny and illuminated as you come back in your full, I feel much safer. 

00:09:35
STEPHEN PORGES (crosstalk)Well, I hope so, I hope so, you just turned into a black screen, and I didn't like that, so I'm going to keep my hand on this mouse, and that'll keep you moving. Okay, so mammals came into the world needing others, and so they had to at birth, they had to functionally trick the parents into saying 'This cute, this is lovely. I want to take care of you.' And they had to functionally trigger the nervous system of another conspecific saying, 'It's okay to hug you, to have sex with you, to reproduce with you. You're safe.' And in doing that, this new system, which utilized a new myelinated (inaudible ) vagus was able to down regulate sympathetic defences, so everything in life is about presenting the cues of safety, so we downregulate defensiveness in appropriate context. So the face is our critical vehicle, but the face and this new myelinated vagus are linked together in great step. So people convey their physiological state, not only their facial expression, but also in the intonation of their voice, so if the voice is prosodic, the voice is conveying to the other that their physiological state is calm. If the voice is a higher pitched, narrow frequency, it's saying that parasympathetic, that new myelinated vagus has taken a break. Don't come near me. 

00:11:10
RICH SIMON So just to put this in context, so at the point where you began to, what was before you began with your work? What was our conception of this social engagement process? I hadn't heard anything about a polyvagal system, and I was one of the people trained in the stone age of sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, and that basically counted human function. 

00:11:35
STEPHEN PORGES But that's how we all are, were, and that's how many people are still trained. So when I give lectures at medical schools, they're still taught that. I mean, they get all excited by this new insight, and they say, 'Oh, it makes sense. So that's what those nerves are for." So the amazing point is that in the brain stem, the area that controls this new myelinated vagus interacts with the area that controls the muscles in the face and head, so you're not talking about correlates, so there was always this interest in can you measure physiology as correlative or signature of emotion? No, it's all part of the same integrated system, and it's integrated because it's bottom up and top down, it's expressive and it's receptive. It's all these features including, okay, so why would you feel calmer when I use a prosodic voice? Because your middle ear muscles start to work. Your middle ear muscles, when they start to work, they start increasing the tone of the myelinated vagas. Most people have never even heard of middle ear muscles. They, even people in speech and hearing sciences basically see them as dampeners of noise, loud noise, reflexes. However, those little muscles change the transfer function of how our ears bring in information to our brain. So, if the muscles are tense, we don't hear predators, we don't hear low frequency sounds, but we hear the prosody of voice, we hear what people are saying, and that changes our physiological state, but remember, if we live in dangerous environments, we don't want to do that, because then we'll be victims, we'll miss a predator. So then you ask the question what types of children (inaudible ) They're living in environments in which the adaptive features of the (inaudible ) is to detect a predator, not speech, it's just not safe. So the part that you didn't learn is that the face really is, when people say you learn your heart on your face, you are. 

00:13:40
RICH SIMON And you're learning your lungs on your face, and this connection, this integrated, how it breathes, and how one's voice sounds and how the dilation of pupils and all of this you're describing, all these are what you're calling an integrated circuit? 

00:14:00
STEPHEN PORGES Yeah, yeah, and part of the problem as a scientist is that we don't know what features we're detecting, so the real issue is like even this word that I coined called neuroception, which is the ability to detect risks in the environment without awareness, I had to coin a word, because we live in a world where things are perception, and perception implies the cognition. Part of what life is all about is that we respond to stuff, and then we try to figure out why are we responding to it? What are the features? Why? Why do we like some people? Why do we want to stay away from others? And, you know, it's usually very predictable why we feel uncomfortable with certain people. 

00:14:40
RICH SIMON So what you're, we're catching up with our neuroception? 

00:14:45
STEPHEN PORGES Yeah. 

00:14:45
RICH SIMON Cognitively. 

00:14:45
STEPHEN PORGES Well, we are, however, what does the culture teach us to do? It's a disrespect that everything is syntactic or linguistic, and just to study this new cognitions, and this leads us also into the path of how do we treat children when they're young, and this is going to be a little bit of a surprise maybe to you or some of your listeners. There's this push to put iPads and tablets and computers for preschoolers, and then you start getting kids engaging objects not people, and what do you take out of the school when you have budget deficit? Take out all the social interaction components. And those social interaction components could be translated into neural exercises, so in a sense, they provide the exercises that enable the individual to gain better state regulation, and that's really where I start the discussion that if we have better state regulation, then we can process information better, we can be nicer people, and here's the other part, the neural pathways of social behavior happen to be the same neural pathways of health, growth, and restoration. 

00:16:00
RICH SIMON So, but a moment ago, and this, you as much as anyone have really popularized this term, and some people may be familiar with it, and others aren't, this distinction between top down and bottom up, so we've been referring to it by different ways, just to make sure the people are following our conversations. Talk to us a bit, what's the difference between this top down organization and the bottom up stimulus of the nervous system. 

00:16:30
STEPHEN PORGES Okay, so the paradox is that it has to be both, so we get into this confused bit, because when we live in what I call the cortico centric world, or cognitive centric world, that's top down, and so what we're really arguing is, I just lost your picture and that is not good, I'm going to just hang for a second. 

00:16:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:16:50
STEPHEN PORGES I want to see you, there you are. Okay, now you have to see me back. Okay? 

00:17:00
RICH SIMON This is actually great, this is very theraputic, because we're, our process is reinforcing our content. So we're talking about social engagement, we're having these challenges to social engagement, and you're very skillfully handling both the social engagement part and the technology. 

00:17:15
STEPHEN PORGES Well, the technology just got to be so much that I forgot what I was saying, so (inaudible ). 

00:17:23
RICH SIMON So we were talking about both. It's top down and bottom up. 

00:17:25
STEPHEN PORGES (crosstalk)Oh, thank you. Okay, so the world that we lived in was basically deferring to the higher levels, so we basically say that the brain controls, the brain monitors, and even the culture in terms of mental illness was often, things are always the head, the problem with even the history of PTSD, with abuse, and all these other things, it's in your head, meaning that you should be able to have control over it. So, that's inappropriate, and then the other issue is anyone who has stomach aches or stomach distension or digestive issues know that they can't really (inaudible ) real well with their gut swollen up, so we know that there's a bottom up component, but the interesting part is that both things work together, so like if I look at you and listen to you, or I feel comfortable with you and you give me praise, and I'm comfortable with you, I'll feel good, but if I see features that aren't good, then my brain will take those same sensory information, the same things you'd, yeah. The same things you're doing to me that I enjoy, my brain will now say, 'Don't touch me, you are a villain. You are a bad person.' What I like to say is that we each have our own TSA agent in us. And if we, the interesting part is we can tell, literally, the clinical history of people by how they respond to strangers who give embraces. So if a person tightens up in an impulse way, it's like a TSA agent saying, 'I'm not taking any chance, no one's getting on board, we'll never beat the terrorist, but no one will ever be on this plane.' And in fact, that's really what social engagement is about evaluation of safety through proximity. It's psychological distance before you get into physical proximity. 

00:19:15
RICH SIMON So one of the things that has, the shifts that seems to me a rather, quite a profound shift in our field is, we're in a profession that has largely defined as talk therapy, and over this last 10 years spread on by, 10 or 15 years, spread on by by folks such as yourself, we've expanded our notion of the talking cure into something that therapists need to do, have a sense of awareness of themselves and the process between them and their client that goes very much beyond just talking. 

00:19:55
STEPHEN PORGES So you're actually talking about being present is the word that is commonly used now. The interesting thing about the, as the polyvagal theory evolved and as the social engagement system started to be described, it started to put a type of credibility to talk therapy, or I wouldn't even call it talk therapy, I would say it would explain how social interactions facilitate health, both mental and physical health, and even the effectiveness of listening and reciprocal behaviors that before that, I've been in this discipline for quite a while, and what we tend to see is people come up with a theory, the come up with a school of treatment, and then everyone, and they can be just brilliant therapists in a sense of people, and then the workshops happen, and then the certification happens, and then you have manualization of procedure without conveying the true aspect of what the treatment really was. It was, in a sense, making the client feel safe with the therapist. 

00:21:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. So your work has been applied in a number of ways, particularly within the trauma community. So talk to us about what is it if people who are listening to our conversation who are working with traumatized people, what is it that perspective of your work and polyvagal theory, what does that open up for them, what are the practical implications for them? 

00:21:30
STEPHEN PORGES This was actually a shock to me. I worked on a theory, it was exciting to me, and then as you probably know, I have several friends who are researchers and clinicians in the trauma world. Well, one, Vessel Van der Koch, you know, quite a prominent figure, invited me to talk to one of his conferences, and I did my talk, this was well over a decade ago. I gave my talk, and I presented the polyvagal theory, and it resulted in literally, I don't want to say people just, they were extraordinarily enthusiastic. It was such enthusiasm that I was embarrassed with shock, not that I'm easily embarrassed. The point was, what did the theory provide the trauma therapists? It provides them with an explanation of shutting down as a defensive strategy. Before that, everyone was talking about stress and sympathetic and HPA access and reactivity and cortisol. And people are still talking about it. The polyvagal theory puts something else on the table. It describes a shutting down response, which occurs in response to life threat. It occurs in response to life threat not how you define it, but how your nervous system defines it. So often, if you are immobilized, you know, held down, abused, your body may literally trigger something in your nervous system, and you will be so scared, or you will pass out, or perhaps drop dead. Any of these things can happen. Or defecate, these are all due to that unmyelinated, old, most primitive vagal circuit. It is the adaptive response that works great for reptiles, but for mammals it doesn't work well, because we need oxygen, it is as simple as that, and the metaphor, and I showed slides of this, is the mouse in the jaws of the cat, and the mouse, of course, people say, 'Oh, it's probably dead,' because the mouse wants to immobilize, it's a reflex. No choice, and people do this also. So the trauma people start to understand that the polyvagal theory gave them insights into the features that their clients were telling them, but it also, over time, I start to understand what was happening to many trauma victims, because by giving talks I was being informed by the community, and what I learned really was that people were heroes, not victims, they were heroes, so they survived, and they had, the problem was that therapy for them was emphasizing their weaknesses, not emphasizing their success in adapting in a situation, and what the polyvagal theory provided was the understanding that if you utilize that very ancient defense system, it's not easy to get out of, and that's why they're (inaudible ) medical treatment, and understanding the difficulties of moving out of that state, and understanding that that is really a heroic state has been helpful. So when people start to see, and I've gotten emails on this, so when clinicians tell their clients, 'Look, see yourself as a hero in surviving this.' They start being proud of themselves and not embarrassed. Then there's a healing that doesn't hurt from that. That is top down, because they're conceptualizing it, and they're not angry at themselves. 

00:25:05
RICH SIMON So what happened for these trauma therapists is they became exposed to your work is an understanding of something that was part of their everyday experience, but they didn't have a language, they didn't have a roadmap of the brain to grasp why this very common response was taking place? 

00:25:30
STEPHEN PORGES (crosstalk)It was worse that that, it was worse than that, because the common propaganda was that they should be in a high status sympathetic activation, because this was a stressful event. There was no conceptualization that you have another defense system that is a shutting down defense system, and even today people are still trying to explain low levels of cortisol by talking about changes in the receptor, which may also occur, but cortisol is not a stress hormone. I mean, that's what it's being described as. It's a hormone that facilitates mobilization, it's like saying that if my heart rate goes up I'm stressed. Well, sometimes yes, sometimes no. If I need to move, my heart rate will go up. If you move alot, cortisol will go up. It's when it's inappropriate for these things to happen that it becomes, can be defined in terms of a maladaptive response, but the big point is that the trauma world was locked into trying to define the effects of trauma and abuse as having major effects on increasing sympathetic (inaudible ), and when it didn't, they were lost. 

00:26:45
RICH SIMON So this is interesting, so this is like a, this is a classic paradigm shift. You had the old model, the old model, you keep getting evidence that disconfirms the old model, but you don't have a new model to replace it, so you keep applying the old model, the old model. 

00:27:00
STEPHEN PORGES Yeah, yeah. 

00:27:00
RICH SIMON So as, so what happened then, at a practical level? So you come along, and suddenly people are saying, 'But I've been seeing this for years, thank you, Dr. Porges, you're describing my experience as a clinician with lots and lots of my patients.' And then what shifted for those clinicians in addition to going beyond the dissonance between their explanatory framework, and what their eyes and their senses were telling them, what difference did that make in their work? 

00:27:30
STEPHEN PORGES Well, I think they became less evaluative of the patients' response and more understanding of the physiological state, and then with the advent of concepts like neuroception and this emphasis of safety, which is what the polyvagal theory is really framed at that thought, they were able to work with their clients to structure more safe environments. So, I'll give you another example. Many of your listeners may know Pat Odgen's work, and Pat is really a remarkable therapist, and she has this wonderful video of where a traumatized individual is negotiating safety with her by having her go further away from the client. You've seen that one? 

00:28:15
RICH SIMON I've seen that, yeah. 

00:28:20
STEPHEN PORGES Okay, so this- 

00:28:20
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)She was at our conference last year. 

00:28:20
STEPHEN PORGES Yeah, so this is a classic manipulation of the client's neuroception, but Pat is allowing the client to take control, and the client is then, the features of the client change as Pat goes away, and then the client says, 'Come closer.' He gestures with the hand and is now in control and starts to smile and laugh, but gaining control, testing proximity, how close can you get and really understanding her own body, but Pat's work is centered on, it's modulating states of safety for optimal functioning, and understanding when you deviate from that, and this is all in a sense neurophysiology underlying much of what Pat's doing resides within the polyvagal theory. 

00:29:05
RICH SIMON So what's interesting here is a couple of things. The shift, what I see as the implication or impact that your work has had is both very subtle and also profound. Subtle in a sense that what 10 years ago might have, this term safety, which has been a term therapists have used for decades, and we were criticized, I think, made fun of, you know. The touchy, feely psychotherapists always concerned about safety, as if that's sort of a fussy quality that middle class people like to have in life, and it's really not rooted in the reality of the world. What you and others have done is really rooted that in our basic biological nature and the basic processes of human interaction. 

00:30:05
STEPHEN PORGES We can't do our biological functions unless we're safe, and this becomes critical as we start learning more about disease of modern day, both mental and physiological, and even the notion of how we treat diseases from a medical perspective doesn't work, because you don't take pills to make people safe. 

00:30:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. So the other piece of it is so the touchy, feely therapist is just dealing with a biological realities of human being and human interaction. The task of affect regulation, which had been in some ways below the radar of the talk therapists, suddenly that has become more and more central, and it seems to me maybe the most, in the most practical implication of what you've been talking about is that, as therapists, we need to become so much more aware of all these nonverbal elements, of how we're contributing to and shaping our relationship with our clients. 

00:31:15
STEPHEN PORGES Absolutely. This is the disconnect between the manualized treatment model versus an understanding of the features that make another feel safe with you, and I think part of, people will say, 'Why didn't you develop a school of therapy based on the polyvagal?' And then I've even say what a mess everyone else would be, and that is people who would be taking notes at my workshops may not be, have the right features to convey the information to their clients, and I think as a trade, I think psychotherapy is kind of caught into that, because it really tried to objectify itself by moving into more quote objective treatments and measurements, and, in part, start to read, not respect enough the subtle features of what made master clinicians master clinicians. So I've kind of an underlying mantra, its a statement really saying there are great therapists independent of their discipline, so it doesn't matter what their degree is in, what they've been trained in, people find great therapists, because they are great therapists, they understand functionally, they know how to make another person feel safe. 

00:32:35
RICH SIMON So you as an observer of people who, so you have not yourself been interested in developing a school of psychotherapy, but when you look at the efforts that various therapists have made to incorporate this understanding of this, what Edward Hall called 50 years ago the hidden dimension of human relationship, if you remember Hall stuff. The first time I was aware of that in this whole, this non-verbal dance between people began to be codified, when you look at the field and the positive steps towards helping people become more like these intuitive master practitioners, what do you see? How is it that therapists, given wherever we are, whatever sensitivity we have to this non-verbal dimension, what we can do to enhance our craft which is a relationship? 

00:33:35
STEPHEN PORGES It's a wonderful question, and my mind flipped where I was on Tuesday afternoon, I got to go to a four hour workshop on being a manager. I took a new job, and I have people reporting to me in this new, this very large organization called Research Triangle Institute, and the reports are about, we do mock ups of reports where there are people who are very talented, but are problems in groups, and you don't tell a person if you're a problem in a group 'Shape up or you're out in three months.' It's a character problem, and you need to create an environments that support that, so the issue is what are some of the things that we can do? Well, part of what I've learned really was that if you engage people, if you understand their features, and I'm basically telling you that intonation is powerful. It has its roots, actually, in all mammalian species. Mammals of all sizes are defined by having detached middle ear bones, which enables them to hear a frequency at social communication, certain frequencies very well only if they are safe, so if you trigger with those frequencies, you get a feedback loop that makes them feel safe. That's a mother's lullaby, that's the melody in a symphony. It certainly is not the music, rap music. Rap music conveys something else. Folk music. Folk music is amazing, because it is usually female voices, but it can be talking about horrible things with this very melodic bit, people are smiling and they're singing, and people are, you know, the stories are pretty horrible. But the point is the power of intonation, the power of voice, the power of vocal music in changing physiological state. We need to get people back on target to understand that. We need to understand that complexity of the acoustic environment which, in the industrial world, is loaded with low frequency sounds that our nervous system interprets as predator. I'll give you an example. I was giving a workshop to a group of psychiatrists and psychologists, and in the afternoon they were going to do some clinical presentations that I would deconstruct, and one chose this wonderful clinical session, but he says, 'I have to apologize, because they were doing major construction in the office next to mine.' And so he's working with this client, and the air hammers are going. 

00:36:15
RICH SIMON Oh no. 

00:36:15
STEPHEN PORGES And the issue is the lack of insensitivity that we may have, because we're taught that it's the words that people say, not how they say it, not where they are. So, you know, everyone's been in therapy at some point in their lives that you know, right? And the issue is we're always looking for a resolution, which is a syntactical explanation, but that's not when a client is ready to go. It's when they are integrated and can deal with things. The part where you're going is can we train people? I think we can enhance them. I think there are many people who love the trade, who probably shouldn't be there, because they're not safe enough, themselves, to convey to the other that the other is safe with them, and this is like defining who's a good parent or who's not a good parent. I always like to say it's impossible to be a good father, it was, but you can be a good grandfather, a good uncle, and I'm looking forward to grandchildren at some point, because I know I'll be good at that. 

00:37:30
RICH SIMON It's an easier. 

00:37:30
STEPHEN PORGES It's easier. 

00:37:35
RICH SIMON A little easier to regulate all these, this whole dimension we're talking about. 

00:37:35
STEPHEN PORGES But I think the point you're bringing up is really an interesting question, and that is how much range does a normal individual have, and what part of that skill set can be modified enough to be a successful therapist? 

00:37:55
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)So there are two things. Let's underline that, because that seems to me that's, in some ways, the heart of the matter. So it seems, first of all, so interesting to talk to you, because you're at the juncture of these two worlds. You've given somebody who, I think people listening to this conversation, you certainly create an atmosphere of safety around yourself, and you're relaxed at least this interview, I find that- 

00:38:20
STEPHEN PORGES (crosstalk)It's the trees in the back, Steve. 

00:38:20
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Doesn't hurt. Another input, but I attribute it mostly, my relaxed state to you and your therapeutic presence, so you have that personal quality, and at the same time, your work has lent the weight of scientific credibility to something that is often a hidden dimension, and is often something entirely unaddressed. You can go through a graduate training in psychotherapy and never talk about much of what you have been talking to us about today. About, so much about voice tone, certain, a certain facial expression, and in fact, within the traditions, the practice of our field, how is it that many of us try to review our effectiveness as therapists? Through case consultations, where we're very rarely, it's almost impossible really to communicate what am I really communicating to a client? You just tell the story of what got discussed in the session, and more often what the client told you about, the story of their life outside that session. 

00:39:30
STEPHEN PORGES You're bringing up, so if we think about this in terms of medecine in the grand rounds, and this is almost what you're coming back to is that just think about the invasion of privacy that the historical grand rounds or morning rounds is about. Where you take the interns and the residents and you walk and discuss the case in front of the client. I think psychology, when it moved into a delivery of service model, tried to, in a sense, pick up part of the features that were, that characterized medicine, let's not- 

00:40:05
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah, and medicine envy. We talk about it. 

00:40:10
STEPHEN PORGES (crosstalk)Yeah, but, you really shouldn't. 

00:40:15
RICH SIMON Yeah, I know, a previous generation, maybe I hope we've learned something about that, when it was, as I was coming up in the field we talked about medicine envy. 

00:40:25
STEPHEN PORGES Yeah, yeah. 

00:40:25
RICH SIMON It had status, more status than we do. Now there's low status in psychotherapists. 

00:40:30
STEPHEN PORGES Yeah, but the issue was a misunderstanding of what it was to be a human being, and a disrespect for that, and an expectation that going for medical or mental care was like taking your car to an automobile shop. They would diagnosis, they would fix it, or they would replace something, and in fact, you have a billing code just left the garage, and you're out. It has very little understanding of the dynamics of the system, and the dynamics of the relationship with the therapist. I think that's really what we were picking up. The dynamics with the relationship to the therapist are, I mean, that's probably what therapy, that is what therapy is supposed to be about. 

00:41:10
RICH SIMON Yeah, and so much of it is so we have our language system, and we have our concepts, our top down way of dealing with life, and then we have all, and this other complementary system, and it's not either or, there as you were describing before, this intuitive way of responding in situations, and so much relatively little of this bottom up mode of response, and that way of knowing gets encoded in language, so much of what we talk about in psychotherapy isn't really what's going on in the moment. 

00:41:50
STEPHEN PORGES But, okay, here's your answer to some of these. It's not merely not encoded in language, we don't have any vocabulary well developed to describe it, but there's a reason a vocabulary well defined. The sensory (inaudible ) specificity of it isn't that great, so people feel good or they feel bad, but the dimensionality of it isn't that specific, however, we are, we're victims and products of our big brain, so what we do is we develop narratives, complex stories, we create things and that visceral input drives it, and so it's critical, this visceral input, how we feel and what we do with it. The issue is just because we do something with it doesn't mean that our narrative is correct. 

00:42:35
RICH SIMON Yeah, and we rely, you and I had a previous discussion about Daniel Coniman and his book, his overall work, but the recent book Thinking Fast And Slow, and this notion of system 1, largely implicit, largely automatic, drives 98% if not more of what we do, and then we have this part of our experience, which he calls system 2, where you bring attention and effort to aspects of human functioning, and we don't want to give that much attention and effort to most of the moments in our life, because evolution has taught us we need to be scanning for threat, and we need to rely on our. So this conversation between system 1 and system 2 is really at the heart of what it means to be a human being, and particularly, what it means to be a psychotherapist. 

00:43:35
STEPHEN PORGES Yeah, and perhaps this system 1 which is really detecting various life threat issues on a visceral level, whether it's from inside from a periphery. When we have that under control, then there's all these opportunities for what I call the expressive world. Not merely intellectual creativity, but also aesthetics and spirituality, that you have to have this resting state of safety. When (inaudible ) safety, then it's just marvelous, things are much more expansive. 

00:44:15
RICH SIMON So to get back to our earlier point about so where, as a therapist listening to our conversation and trying to draw some practical implications from it, the one thing that, in my own life experience, that made the most contribution, much of my training as a psychotherapist did not greatly expand my ability to be aware of this whole dimension of human expressivity and the functioning of the polyvagal system and my impact on others, but one experience that I had that really was profoundly helpful with that was a couple of summers of improvisational theater which, where, and this was maybe that we, I wonder if you have some exposure to the arts, and really what the arts do is expand our capacity to bring in this move into this hidden dimension of things. To move to- 

00:45:15
STEPHEN PORGES (crosstalk)Well, I'm going to flip this a little on you, because I started off when I was an adolescent, I was a musician. I was a clarinetist, and what I have played with over the intervening years is really watching that new formula. What was I really doing, and if you're an actor or you're a vocalist, what it did alot with, it taught me alot about breath. So, I'm actually going to give you a little physiology of breath, and little things I didn't really understand. I'll go through. Did you play a wind instrument, by any chance? 

00:45:45
RICH SIMON I was an accordionist, in the Bronx in the '50s, that was the instrument of choice in my neighborhood. 

00:45:55
STEPHEN PORGES Oh, wow, wow. Did you have rollerskates also? No. Okay, so the issue is when you play the clarinet, you're basically exhaling slowly, controlling the muscles of the face, and listening. That's pranayama yoga, but that is also exercising the whole entire social engagement system. So when you exhale, what you are doing is increasing vagal efferent action on the heart. So the slow exhalation, which you do with breathing or singing, or even if you're a string player, you're still dealing with the phrasing, that increases vagal action in the heart, it's common. It also increases the neural tone for the facial muscles, that's with the embouchure, and you're listening, so you're doing all this cortical top down, you're regulating the discourse, it's feeding back, and that in a sense, was an amazing experience. I didn't understand how important it was for me to practice the clarinet. 

00:46:50
RICH SIMON But that literally is a practice. A self regulatory polyvagal practice. 

00:47:00
STEPHEN PORGES It was a totally polyvagal experience, and it can only be explained through this understanding that the interaction between the vagas and the facial muscles, and that's what music was, but when people ask me what they can do, because they, I'm not a therapist, they have these kids who want to come, and I say, 'Wind instruments or singing lessons.' And the power of singing lessons in making people feel calm and in control. 

00:47:30
RICH SIMON It's interesting, as you're talking about the clarinet, I a few weeks ago was watching this documentary about Woody Allen, known for many things, but amongst other things a life, someone who is a professional musician in addition to his other accomplishments, and he's a clarinetist, himself, and somebody was pointing out the connection between comedy and his, the expressive quality of Woody Allen humor and these movies, and the sensitivity of the musician, just as you are describing the timing, the breath, the joke, the punchline comes on this beat, or a half beat later, and there's a whole dimension of life that the musician is exquisitely aware of that- 

00:48:20
STEPHEN PORGES (crosstalk)And the improv person, obviously is also- 

00:48:20
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Absolutely. 

00:48:20
STEPHEN PORGES (crosstalk)Because you're trying to attend to the cues and find the lead in. And so I would ask you the same question, what's the difference between improv and psychotherapy? 

00:48:35
RICH SIMON Well, it's interesting that you ask, I was just working on a blog the other day about this, and I think my own sense is that if, it's far more helpful for the clinician to think of what they're doing as an improvisational experience with another human being than to think of it, as we were saying a little, as you were talking about a little before, by protocalizing psychotherapy, which is just to an improvisational comedian, the whole idea of a protocol is deeply comical. That automatic functioning, that we do it by the, where are we at now, step three? What am I supposed to do now, what am I supposed to, am I supposed to frown at you? So I think that whole frame of being improvisationally alert, and the great rule of improvisation is Yes, and, rather than No. 

00:49:30
STEPHEN PORGES Right, right. 

00:49:30
RICH SIMON You accept and then develop something further. 

00:49:35
STEPHEN PORGES However for an academic it's always No, but. 

00:49:40
RICH SIMON It's the exactly, it's the two words. The yes and, and the no but. 

00:49:45
STEPHEN PORGES Yeah. 

00:49:45
RICH SIMON So as you look over the field of the various therapists that you mentioned, Pat Ogden, what have you seen that in a concrete way that with therapists have taken your work and begun to apply it in ways that wouldn't have occurred naturally to you or automatically to you? 

00:50:10
STEPHEN PORGES Well, okay, first of all, I've been personally, let me use the term humbled by the reception. I'm a laboratory scientist, and I like to talk, I like my work, I'm passionate about that, but I was totally unprepared for the acceptance within the very, very broad medical world, and even when I put together this book of papers on the polyvagal theory, I expected a few people to buy it, sit on it, or go to sleep on it, but they actually, people have read it, it's sold several thousand copies to my surprise, and people are actually using it. They congratulate themselves on being able to read it, because it's so dense, but the issue is that it's, I'm very taken by the fact that people who are working with others think the world better really are looking for ideas and information, and it's the commissions who are dealing with the trenches, who are the ones that have really been, in a sense, coming to me and interested in these ideas. Within the academic world, it's so structured, so even though my work is so research based, the academic world is basically school driven. What type of therapist are you? Actually there was an article in the New York Times on that. It was branding your type of therapy or something. Did you see that? 

00:51:35
RICH SIMON Oh yeah, in the Times Magazine this last weekend. 

00:51:35
STEPHEN PORGES (crosstalk)Yeah, and you know, you can't be a therapist, you have to be some type of therapist. 

00:51:40
RICH SIMON We'll you have to market yourself and find your niche. 

00:51:45
STEPHEN PORGES Right, right. Yeah, and so it's the people who've been out there, and out there for many years who I've really gotten close to, many of them, and I'm personally flattered, but also excited by the idea of the welcoming and the ability to inform others about knowledge that they can use, it can be helpful to people. There's part of us that have, those of us from the '60s, we have certain expectations in life, we really want to make the world a better place, but we also want to actualize who we are, and to be able to contribute on both those dimensions through discovery, and in a sense, sharing information is just a wonderful path. 

00:52:30
RICH SIMON So what, at a personal level, so here's you're somebody who has, let me just before we ask that question, which I'm very interested in, just let me insert something here, that when I was speaking with Coniman in another series, because he's also somebody who's a, has mapped out something, and it doesn't system 1, system 2 doesn't have direct therapeutic application, so I asked him what impact he's had, and he looked in that very self effacing way which may be the mark of a real scientist and not unlike your own, and he said, 'I felt like my primary contribution in some ways is a contribution of language. That I gave a language to an aspect of human experience that previously people knew it, but they hadn't language for it.' How would that match- 

00:53:20
STEPHEN PORGES (crosstalk)Well, I don't even say a language, I'd say I gave a metaphor. So in a sense, the concept of a polyvagal theory that emphasizes a phylogenetic hierarchy, which gives you an organizational principle is really a big, it's a gift that was given to me just through the act of looking without bias, and I'm so happy to share that, but the part that I really want to emphasize on that is that when we understand that the transitions through evolution, between reptiles and mammal are really the transitions of isolation to social interaction, and all the changes in the more primitive nervous systems of mammals are the secrets that are enabling people to understand and can treat various behavioral mental disorders, it's really very interesting understanding that transition. You may not know, but my wife is Sue Carter, and she was the one who discovered the relationship between oxytocin and social behavior. 

00:54:25
RICH SIMON Oh, okay. 

00:54:25
STEPHEN PORGES And that also is in the transition from reptiles to mammals, so reptiles don't have a simple oxytocin receptor or peptide, it's called vasotocin, it's a combination of oxytocin or mesotocin, a combination of vasopressin and oxytocin, the point is, as we look we start seeing these massive changes in neurophysiology and nervous system regulation, and those are the systems that are vulnerable through stress and disease, and as a clinician, when you see peoples' face is flat and your voices don't have (inaudible ), and then you know the next part. They have digestive problems, they have hypertension, they have all these over things that are part of this whole integrated system shutting down. And we need to start thinking in this other form of a metaphor, so going back to what you are saying, it's the metaphor of the hierarchy of systems and how they evolve and how they are organized in the active human. 

00:55:30
RICH SIMON So even in this intimacy of the clinical encounter there's this, you're telling us a story, your work is telling us a story about how this is the culmination of eons of human evolution, which is an extension of the evolution of life is being played out in our offices every day. 

00:55:50
STEPHEN PORGES Yeah, yeah, and you can see, I mean, the retraction, people call oppositional or defensive behaviors are really just using more primitive systems, and in fact, people use the word primitive, don't get so primitive. There's so much intuition imbedded in our language. 

00:56:05
RICH SIMON That's right, that's right. 

00:56:10
STEPHEN PORGES That can be deconstructed into a neurophysiology. 

00:56:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. Last question for you because our time is just about up. So, somebody who's devoted his life to bringing into our awareness something that we all know in the deepest, literally in our bowels, amongst other places, and you've brought this, and you've explained so much that previously either we mislabeled or didn't understand at all. Personally for you as you've been on this journey of scholarship, of scientific discovery, what have been the most important learnings for you that you've applied in your own life? 

00:56:55
STEPHEN PORGES Well, it's actually learning to listen, I hate to say this, but learning to listen, and that listening is therapeutic as well as talking. Maybe I should end with that. It's the fact that if you understand the whole notion of reciprocity, and again, this is really healthy relationships and play are defined by reciprocity and role reversal, and when we understand that and allow that to occur in our local environment, life is much more fun. 

00:57:30
RICH SIMON What seems like a really terrific point to punctuate this conversation, and it will, we hope, continue in the comments that those of you who listen to the conversation will continue it, so the comment board is appearing on your screen, so if listening to Stephen you have some thoughts, made some connections of your own, had some polyvagal response that you want to put into language, whatever it is, please, it is an opportunity to share it, not only is a benefit to the group, but to yourself to put these intuitive responses into language, we'll pass these along to Stephen. If he so moves, he may respond, but at the very least for us, we will continue the conversation. Stephen, if people would like to find out more about your work, where would you go, and how, give us some directions. 

00:58:25
STEPHEN PORGES There's a webpage stephenporges.com, I don't keep it up to date all the time, but it has information on it, and it has some downloadable materials that people might find a bit visceral, and if they are really up to task, there is a book called the Polyvagal Theory and, yes, I will write one in English some day. I do have a contract by the book, there is another book listed on Amazon that hasn't been written yet, but- 

00:58:55
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:59:00
STEPHEN PORGES Which is supposed to be a very readable book, and it will be a readable book that's being written for clinicians and for laypeople. 

00:59:05
RICH SIMON We look forward to it. What a pleasure to have this conversation with and to be in your extremely therapeutic calming presence. Thank you so much for giving us this time. 

00:59:20
STEPHEN PORGES Thank you very much, Rich. 

00:59:20
RICH SIMON That's it for this installment of Neuroscience In Action. I look forward to having you join us next time. Bye Bye.
