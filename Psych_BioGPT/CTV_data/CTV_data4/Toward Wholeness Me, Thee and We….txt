DIANA WHITNEY There was a time when I was invited to speak in India and I took it lightly. I went and I travelled around India and had been advised by a woman friend -- an Indian woman friend as soon as I got to India, buy Indian clothes. So, I was travelling around in this beautiful, big ballerina fabrics and I had a great time travelling for about ten days and I walk into the hotel where I was to begin the conference and everyone was in business suits. And it was the President of India who was doing the opening. And the next morning, I was to do a talk. I had brought a business suit, but I was introduced by a business leader who was himself introduced by another woman in the community. So, the degree of formality was more than I had ever experienced. So, I decided to be Ken Gergen. I had fortunately written quite a very good paper. I had it on the podium and I just leaned up to the podium took off my glasses and I thought what would Ken do in -- if you’ve ever seen Ken you know how he sometimes will have his glasses on and his glasses off and he’ll read and then off conversation. I was so glad in that moment that I had Ken Gergen with me as my friend and in my being. And so, Ken said last night that we are all with so many others. We are each of us, a polyphonic, multi-placic being and what I want to do today is to stretch a bit our understanding and our conversations, because -- it’s not understanding, it’s not quite the right word. Our conversations about relatedness and I want to invite us first thing this morning to really think about our relations beyond people relationships. We’re here, how many of you have awed at the beauty of this location? Yeah, did anybody see the sunrise this morning? That’s magnificent. So, I live in a world where there’s a word that’s very, very important and that word is called Mitakuye Oyasin. Mitakuye Oyasin is a Lakota word that means all my relations, all my relatives. And all my relatives that means yes, my kids, my family, my parents, those that have come before me, those that will follow me. But it also refers to the spirit realm for those of you have those relationships, know them or don’t know them. It refers to the plants and animals, the rock people, the tree people. The rock people, the tree people, you know that expression, sometimes you find yourself between a rock and a hard spot. Have you ever asked the rock what you ought to do or talk to it a tree? And so, my world is a world populated with the presence of all of these relations. I’ve come to that in one way through my studies with Lakota Holyman and being invited into that community, but I also come to it through another interesting way. The writings of Christopher Alexander if you know his work, he wrote a pattern language and a number of other books. Professor of Meritus of Stanford in Architecture and he says there is life in everything. Everything, a building, a space, a bridge, a community. And for him, the purpose of architecture is to infuse life and to create spaces and places and things that bring out the life of the people. So, I want to invite you this morning to join me in welcoming all our relations. And I’m going to do this in a bit of a prayerful way so if you’re inclined and you want to, you could stand. Does anybody know which way is really West? That way? Fabulous. So, I’m going to simply invite our relations to be with us today.

DIANA WHITNEY Thank you for joining me in that. I personally have found that when I’m writing, if I don’t get quiet and ask for help, I’m really stuck most of the time and when I’m working, if I go into a setting and I kind of am wondering what to do and I ask and listen, I’ll have some very interesting possibilities. There is no one answer, no more than there is an answer from a person that you are talking to. There’s no one answer. But it is a world that I live in and they think many of us populate the world of divine and the world of spirit and I’m honored to be able to just invite those voices here today. So, I brought this title, I have been working -- doing consulting work for probably close to 30 some years. I did my Ph. D. and my area was innovation and I was curious about how innovations traveled through social systems. So, I started out big, it was a communication study, but how is it that innovations from research and development get into practice and of course the answer was relationships. People in conversations with one another. And then I began to listen to what was going on in my world in the 60s and the 70s and there were couple of things that really stuck -- have stayed with me. And there are phrases that I think transformed communities in the world and one of this phrases was “Black is beautiful.” That phrase set in motion possibilities that couldn’t have been there before. And so again, I’m listening, I’m going awe the world is a world in language. Things shift, but what is it that creates and allows those large scale shifts and another one that many of you here maybe familiar with “Sisterhood is powerful.” I like to tell the story that when I was -- I know this was before I met Ken and Mary. I was raising little kids and living in the suburbs and had a women’s consciousness raising group. One of the members of my group, her act of liberation was to give away her mother in law’s family’s chocolate cake recipe. She had sort of sworn to keep that recipe a secret and for her, giving away a chocolate cake recipe was an act of liberation. Okay, so we just we never know, but there are things that happen over time and in societies and in organizations that can precipitate a change almost overnight, except that it’s been building over time and it keeps going for a long time. And so, my curiosities have been about large scale transformation for a very long time. And I want to share with you a story this morning that tells you this story about when I gave up the rules. Because that’s a hard thing to do and most of us who take on this world of social constructionism have to give up the rules. As Ken said, he is kind of been an outsider, insider for most of his career, sort of popping the rules for us. I have been doing consulting and had just started my own practice. And I went off to a conference on strategic planning because of course that was where the executives went. Right, If you want to talk executive talk, you use the word strategy several times and strategic planning. And so I went to this conference and I met a number of people. One of them said to me, you know I think my organization might like you to work with them. But we need to bring you to Toronto and you need to meet our whole executive team so that we can determine if your value is compatible. Now, I was kind of accustom, I was young and I knew I had to prove myself. But they wanted to know if those values compatible. So, I went to Montreal and I spent three days interviewing some of the most remarkable people that I still to this day have met. And they told me their stories and they asked me to share my story. Two of them were the founders who realized they had no clue how to run a business so they hired themselves a boss. There was a lot of humility. One of them was Japanese and he told me about when he took his sabbatical just the year before and went back to Japan and met his family and took his family. And so, I was learning about these people. One of them was the director of medicine for their business and for the local hospital. Bill Anderson was in his early 80s at that time. At that time, I was a young consultant and so I believed in things like confidentiality of information. And so, I interviewed everybody and I was going to keep it confidential. These are my private interviews with each person and I’m learning and they are getting to know me and then getting ready then in a month or so go back and meet with these executives and of course now I had all their data, right. I had collected the information and I was going to be the expert and wisely feed it back to them and tell them something. And one of the things that I heard through these interviews, each one of these executives said, we are concerned about Bill. Bill should retire, it’s not money, we would keep paying him, he doesn’t need it anyway, he is in his 80s. We’re worried about him, we love him. And then I interviewed Bill, Bill was my last interview on Friday. And he said, I know they all want me to retire cause they’re worried about me, but I don’t know what else I would do, I love my work, I love these people, I love being around the new, young generation. And I had each executive talk about what they admired and respected in each other executive. So, I had a great experience and I was just hoping they would find me values compatible. I left, got home late Friday night and early Saturday morning my phone rang, Bill Anderson had passed away. And I had his last words. I had his last words, the only person he saw after me was his wife. Now, I was a young consultant. I hadn’t ever had any training in grief whatever. I wasn’t even a counselor, but I knew that that information didn’t belong inside of me and it wasn’t confidential. So, I talked and said I’d like to come back and I’d like to share with you all what Bill said, and they said Oh! We’re so glad, we were hoping you would say that. And I went back and I sat with the whole group together and then I met with them one-on-one again. And I said here is what Bill told me about you and why he has loved working with you and why he didn’t want to resign or retire. And at that point that there were two important lessons to me. As a consultant, the rules were only guidelines that we have to be making it up as we go along. We have to be making it up because that’s what we’re here to do to create the best possible moment that we can, the best possible day that we can. And so, yeah the confidentiality, it took me a while before it really kind of gave it up completely. But the other thing I eventually gave up was getting in the middle of people and their stories. I don’t belong there. And so, with appreciative inquiry people sit in tables and they tell their own story. There is no expert, there is no consultant, there is no coach between people and their stories and each other. And there is the two really important lessons for me as I’ve done this work over many, many years. And these folks are still with me so when we talk about being with -- I have that community with me. I did go on to work with them for probably three years after that and they’re very dear to me even this day. So, I share that with you because there will come a time if it has not already happened and which you will throw away the rules, because it’s what we do as social constructionists. We find what is possible in the now. Also, I want to share another story because the title of the conference, peace building, mediation and conflict transformation. I kind of when went to a colleague, I’m thrilled to be invited and thrilled to be invited to speak, but I haven’t done anything like what you all do. So, I want to say thank you to all of you for the work that you do. You are stepping into hot spots regularly and finding ways to help bring people to a level of peace within themselves and with each other and find that to be very important. It’s a very important work. And so, I went back and I went okay -- do I work in these arenas? Well yes, you’re going to hear this story of the united religions initiative my dear brother Charles Gibbs is here and he will tell a bit of that story, but you know I helped with the organizational stuff. I didn’t get into the messy peace building stuff, but then Mary Gregen will probably say well Diana you never get into the messy stuff, you just us to be appreciative and she’s right because I also believe as Ken said yesterday, there is no such thing as conflict. It’s another one of the stories that we tell. And if it’s a helpful story, well let’s tell it, and if it’s not helpful, let’s find another story. So, here is some of the things that I do when I’m working. One contentious situation, Bruce Power, Nuclear Power facility in Northern Canada, I was asked to work with union management relationships. Okay, well I can do that, it’s scary, but I can do that. And I find out that it’s a medium being planned by the executive leadership team with some other consultants, I’m now part of that team and nobody has talked to the union leaders who will be there. Okay, this was not going to be a good idea for me to walk into that. So I said all right, before we go further in our plan, we have to have some conversations and include the other people who will be at the meeting and that was great. They got to talk, they got to say what they were expecting, they got to show me that they were going to be angry and they we’re going to huff and puff. So, that was all cool and then my colleague -- the colleague that I was looking over, we thought about this. And we thought one of the things that is their story is that there are leaders and the union right, leaders and the union. And I was, that’s kind of crazy, because the people come into this meeting are all leaders. They’re all leaders, union leaders are as a significant leader is a company and leader. So, we address them all as leaders and we told them and talk to them as a leadership team. Now, that caused a little bit of disturbance in some of their minds, but that’s okay, because that’s also what we have to do. Innovation is edgy so if we’re going to innovate, if we’re going to create the social innovations that Ken talked about last night, we’ve got to be willing to be edgy. So, you’ve got to be willing to shake things up. David Couperator occasionally will talk about the appreciative dislodgement of certainty. A great phrase. I’ve recently been talking about the little writing on the idea of interpretive generosity. How do we interpret what we see, what we experience with generosity. Okay, you all leaders, that’s a generous way of talking to them. And then the other thing that happened in this meeting that I think set us off very nicely in the beginning was some of you who do facilitation you may start with, okay let’s set our ground rules, how many of you’ve ever done that? Okay, and then how many people break the ground rules. Right, so why bother doing it, it doesn’t work, it’s one of these things, it doesn’t work. So, what we said to folks, now this is a meeting about conversation. And we’re not going to tell you how to do conversation, but everyone of you has someone or some group with whom you have great communication. Think about that right now, make some notes. Who is that person, what makes that conversation and that communication so fantastic and share it with one person at your table. Okay, we did that, and we said now, that’s how we’re going to be together this week. It’s that simple. You all know how to do it, that’s what we’re going to do. So, there’s no ground rules, there’s nothing to be people up and punish them because they don’t do it. It’s about how do we invite people to be the best they can be keep reminding them that they already know how do what we want them to do. See that’s what I think Gandhi meant when he said, be the change you want to see or Nike says Just do it. They’re saying the same thing. How do we bring and remind people that they already know how to be peace. Not that they can talk about it and analyze it and work on it and plan it and that we can just be it. That’s what I think is the masterfulness of our work when we can find a way to enact our greatest ideals and just be it. A friend of mine and the same actually look cool to them, a ceremony that’s called a Sun Dance and he started his ceremony calling it a Sun Dance for Peace. You know how many times do we do things. We get together we have a dialogue for a piece, a dialogue for survivors or and then after a couple of years he said, you know, that's really not what I want, I want this to be a time where people will come together and dance peace and so it is now a dance of peace. It is a peak to come together to dance peace. Now what that's giving them are so many opportunities to learn what's involved in a community of peace that comes together for 10 days out in the middle of the desert, you know, all the things that we need to know about just being peace. So, I wanted to give you a little bit. I don't have provocative propositions as Ken did but I have a few points that I'm going to attend to -- to bring into story here and the first thing is over many many years what I have learned is there's two things about change in organizations and communities and it's real simple. Change who's talking to whom to whom and about what? Change who is in the conversation and what they talk about. Now, that's not always an easy thing to do. So one of my guiding principles is all the people whose future it is must be in the room. All the people whose future it is because again so often are old ways of doing things where some of us talked about things, made decisions and organizations rolled them out to other people. How many of you felt like you have ever been steamrolled by somebody else's ideas, of course. So, how do we engage all the people whose future it is. Then folks come to me and say well but Diana, I work for the American Society For Prevention Of Cruelty To Animals, how do we get the critters in the conversations. That's a good question, how might you do that? Or I work for the Environmental Conservation Fund. How do we get the land in the conversation or the trees in the conversation. So these are some I think important questions. I want to share with you a project that was in fact quite challenging and then draw a number of things out of it. A number of years ago, I got a phone call from a young woman, more energy than I can ever imagine and she said to me, I'm calling you because I work for the Idaho Department of Education and we need to do an Appreciative Inquiry Summit and I said okay, wait a minute here because whenever someone wants to do appreciative inquiry, my first question is to be a little cautious and to say to what end? What is your purpose and how did she know about appreciative inquiry? She's well I'm in graduate school and I read your book and I'm oh my god okay this is getting really dangerous right? Somebody wants appreciative inquiry and I said what's going on? She said well, here's the situation. I work for the State Department of Education. In Idaho, we have one of the best schools in the country for students who are deaf and students who are blind and we about two years ago, one of our state legislators was at a cocktail party, probably had a glass too many of wine and made a comment, something like you know we ought to close that school, we could save a lot of money and we could probably provide services in some other way. Well, there was media in the room. It got picked up. It's been two years and we cannot quiet that rumor. We have said, no the school is not going to be closed. We have had community town meetings, kind of that just blew up in our face and we can't quiet things. We've got our faculty at the school wondering if they should look for other jobs. We have families who move across the state from out of state to come and have their children attend this school. We've got to do something and the only thing we can think of doing now is bringing everybody together and I said who do you mean by everybody? So there's an interesting question for you at your tables. Just one minute or two minutes at your table, who would you invite to this meeting? Imagine 250 seats in the room, it's the State Department of Education, services for students who are deaf and blind. Who would you invite to this meeting? Take a minute and talk. Alright, let me hear who would you invite to this party? Who would you include in an appreciative inquiry meeting around this topic. 

00:30:00
 The children. 

00:30:00
DIANA WHITNEY The children. Children who are deaf, children who are blind. Maybe their friends. 

00:30:05
 The guy who said to close it. 

00:30:10
DIANA WHITNEY The person who are some of the state legislators. Absolutely. 

00:30:15
 Parents. 

00:30:15
DIANA WHITNEY  Parents. Absolutely parents. 

00:30:20
 The media. 

00:30:20
DIANA WHITNEY The media. 

00:30:20
  Tax payers. 

00:30:25
DIANA WHITNEY Uhm? 

00:30:25
 Tax payers. 

00:30:25
DIANA WHITNEY Tax payers. Right. 

00:30:25
  Other schools. 

00:30:30
DIANA WHITNEY Other schools. 

00:30:30
 Ex-students. 

00:30:30
DIANA WHITNEY  Ex-students. People who have graduated from this school who are deaf and blind. 

00:30:35
  The teachers. 

00:30:40
DIANA WHITNEY The teachers. 

00:30:40
 Union leaders. 

00:30:40
DIANA WHITNEY Union, there weren't union folks. That's a different story but it would have been a good idea. 

00:30:45
  The custodians, the cooks, the bus driver. 

00:30:50
DIANA WHITNEY Everyone from the school who wanted to be there. Yes, so the school needed to be there. The families needed to be there. The students, the graduates. The governor's office. The State Department of Education. The state legislators had to be there. Sign interpreters. I didn't know this but when does sign interpretation, you can do it for about 20 minutes and you have to trade off so at every table we had six folks and two interpreters. We also had Braille recorders on every table as well as flip charts. Oh, by the way, guide dogs. Some of the people had to bring their dogs. So, we created a room that was probably three times this size and it was a public meeting. So it was announced in the newspapers anyone who wanted to come could come. So, all the interest groups were invited. All those who were in favor and those who were not. They all got invited and we created a setting very much like this, a bit larger and I had a space that was like this. I couldn't move very much because my microphone was so finely tuned so that people with even a little bit of hearing could hear through this particular microphone and there we were using appreciative inquiry. So we had everyone in the room. Now, the second piece that's really important is that the topic, the purpose of your meeting whether it's two of you, 20 of you or 200 of you has to be worthy and if we had just said come and let's decide whether we are going to keep this school or not, what would have I been inviting? Huge war and it's not worth people's time. So we talked and we talked. What is really a worthy topic. So we said, let's come together to create a set of recommendations for educational excellence for students who are deaf and blind. So the topic was educational excellence for students who are deaf and blind. Our outcome was going to be a set of recommendations that would go to the school board and then on to the state legislator to be budgeted and yes this school was one part of that conversation but we had bigger work to do and that's what's really important. Bigger work to do. It's so important that we learn whether we're counselors or coaches, consultants to help invite bigger questions, so that when people gather, they feel that they can, one, see themselves in the conversation. We needed a conversation that would be relevant to everyone and two, they find that there is some worth in what they are talking about. Something can happen as a result of it. So we began the conversations and needless to say, we spent quite a bit of time with the interview guide, the appreciative interview guide and we asked everyone to tell their story of what when they were first introduced to the world of the deaf and the blind because that was why everyone was there. They might say but what if some people weren't or we said or someone who is very different than you. Alright, so our focus was relatedness with students and people who are deaf and blind but maybe some people didn't have that context so we sit with someone very very different from you and then we asked them to tell a story about their experience with the school whether they had heard about it or had an actual experience and we had a lengthy interview guide and after the interviews, that first morning I said, okay does anyone have something that you'd like to share and one woman raised her hand and I said yes, and she said you know, I am in the state legislature and I know what's been going on and I came here thinking that we needed to close the school. She said but I just interviewed George. This could make me cry. I just interviewed George and George's wife went to the school. She's a graduate of the school. George as you know is one the businessmen in our community and he's the owner of blah, blah, blah and as I talked to George, I learned about the school and I learned from George that he would not have been able to marry his wife if she had not had the life skills that she had at the school. She not only learned how to read and speak a little bit but she learned how to take care of a family and how to keep a home. I want to say that I think we need to keep this school. One interview. That changed clearly the context of the meeting. As the meeting went on, we went through the appreciative inquiry process. We discovered the strengths, we dreamed. Again, I was a little nervous. How do we do skits and dreams and have people show us the future and folks did it. My clients said no don't take that out so there were people up on the stage like this with their guide dogs and there were people sign languaging and it was absolutely lively and meaningful and then we went to craft provocative propositions. We started it one day and we come in the next morning and someone comes up to me and says you know I thought we were going to create our own propositions and recommendations but there's a list of things already on the table. Not really. Now I see the list. She brings me the list. Some subgroup had gotten together the night before and had written their list of recommendations. Put them on every table and planted the seeds that everyone at their tables should accept this list. Now those of you know me know that I can at sometimes get a little angry and that didn't seem to be quite the right response at that moment and I just said okay. What's at issue here and I took the microphone and I said, you know, something has just come to my attention. I understand that there is a group of people who did so much fantastic work for us last night. They got together, they put extra time in and they've given us a draft list of recommendations on every table. Now, what I want to say is thank you. Have a look at it. I will imagine that there's something really good in that work that's been done. I also want to say that this is a democratic process and that no one has to accept anything that you don't like or don't want. So when you have a look at it, if there's something valuable, take it, use it but we will create our own today and I was just so grateful, I didn't even know where those words came from. I did not know because the mother in me wanted to send and find out who they were and send them to their room so that the rest of us could do what we wanted to do and play nice. Okay, but that notion of even in that moment finding a way to honor what was done and still have it be included in our work was really really important. So we went on that day. We listed the recommendations and at which point, someone said aren't we going to vote on the school? Aren't we going to vote on the school? Now, I'd sort of thought that would come along. I hadn't built it into the agenda but I sort of thought that might happen and so I turned to my couple of clients and I said what do you think? And they stood up and said alright let's do it. And so we took time at each table to talk about it and the decision was given the set of recommendations that we've just put forth. Do you want to vote yes, the school should stay open or no the school should be closed and we should find services elsewhere. Needless to say, the room unanimously voted yes, let's keep the school and each table said and we want more parent involvement and we want this and we want research across universities and K-12 schools and so the energy just kept going. After that meeting, there were a number of public meetings and the information, the recommendations did go into the state department to refine them and they went to the state legislature and they were budgeted. So, it's a story of getting everybody in the room having the courage and it did, it took courage on everyone's part to be there and hold it in a positive possibility. There was one advocacy group who called Washington DC and tried to report us for not having a safe space for people who were blind because there were electrical cords going from one table to another in the room and that's in fact the case but they were electrical cords so that the blind people whose computers would have big print that they could use them and we, you know, had it cordoned off but the trouble makers wanted to make trouble. So, the folks in Washington called back and said hey we hear this is going on and I just wanted to let you know and so all of the communication was open and flowing and we tried to keep it as transparent as possible with everybody in the room. So I just wanted to share that one story with you as a way of saying have courage. You know, get the kids in the conversation. Get the people who are the others, whoever they are, bring them into your conversations. It will make a difference. Everyone whose future it is a topic of compelling interest. Now, here's one of my lessons. This delights me. As I worked with appreciative inquiry over the years, I've come up with this notion that what we must always be doing is a quest for uniqueness and so what we do with appreciative interviews is we say find someone who's different than yourself and find out what matters to them. Ask them these questions and learn who they are uniquely because here's what I've noticed. When I would work and I'd say to a group of people. You know, get together and talk about what you have in common. Inevitably, people would come back and they would say well, we talked, we had our 15 minutes and here's what we have in common but really we're very different. You know, we're from Brazil, we're from Japan and we're really different. We have different ways and so that inquiry into commonality would tend to sort of invite it's opposite, people's need to be different. So when you invite people to talk about their differences and their uniqueness that invites it's opposite, which is commonality and there's this rich sort of tapping in to universal. So the more you can be curious about uniqueness and you can invite people to tell their own unique and different story and honor it and have each other learn from one another what seems to happen is an invitation to get to what some people say oh it's universal. Isn't it universal? We are all the same. Now that's -- you know, I don't quite go there but I will tell you one funny story about an appreciative interview so many of you have participated with us. So, to a group of people at one point, find somebody that you don't know in the room and do the interview. Came back and I said how was that and people started saying, well, you know, we had so much in common, we're this, we're that and one person said, okay you thought you had something in common. My partner and I just learned that we were born on the same day in the same hospital in the same town but we do have different mothers and they had never met. There they were in an appreciative interview finding that much in common and it was obviously light hearted for all of them. So this search and quest for uniqueness, I think is a really important practice, relational practice that appreciative inquiry has to offer to this big field of peace building. The other one is as I've said, interpretive generosity. Giving people opportunities to tell stories from different perspectives, from different voices, one of the things that we so often play with is imagine your business, your company in 10 years or 20 years, when your children are looking for a job. What would you want to have happen now so that this is a kind of place that you would want your children to work or you know, so many of us we learned what we know from our parents and our grandparents. If you weren't here but your grandparents were in this room, what would they be saying? So there's a lot of ways to invite other voices into the dialog in large groups as well as in small groups and doing it with a frame that invites a generous story telling that brings out and shows the best of other people and that's another piece that appreciative inquiry does and the final piece that I want to just mention is what I come to start calling punctuate the possible, this notion of possibility because we don't know for certain, what's going to happen and we start inviting more people in the conversation, we really don't know and in many ways, it's not our job to say, this is what you have to do. But if we can point out as the facilitators, as the counselors, as the coaches that something might be possible either because you've heard a story of it from someone else or because it just sounds good. Then what we can be doing is giving people hope and that's another thing that I think is so essential. I was asked, this is kind of -- Mary might go oh Diana you didn't do this. I was at a small gathering and someone was talking about his new book and he's a written a book called Smartphone Stupid and he wanted to know if I might read it and did I know anyone who might want to help him publish it and I said well is your book hopeful? And he said, well my book, there's just so much we need to know about how these phones are really damaging us and all the brain damage that's getting done and all of this and it's breaking down relationships and he just had this whole list of how stupid smartphones are and I said well, but then does it give us hope. Do you give us some practices, things that we can do? No, people really need to know the problem. Then I went, you know, I don't think I'm the right person to read your book because I wouldn't have been. I wouldn't have been helpful to someone who's so focused that way. So this ability to be positively possible open doorways is the final one that I want to talk about and thank you. That's it. I guess I should say are there any questions?
