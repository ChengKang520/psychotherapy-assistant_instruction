00:01:10
JILL HILL Ph.D. I’m an Assistant Professor here in the counseling psychology program and I have the distinct honor of introducing Dr. Carolyn Barcus, really looking forward to… to hearing her talk. Let me just give you a little bit of background on Dr. Barcus. She has served as the Director of the American Indian Support Project in the Psychology Department at Utah State University since 1991 and she was Assistant Director for the five years prior to that time. And in the 25 years of the American Indian Support Project, which Dr. Barcus was instrumental in developing, 35 American-Indian students have attained MS in Psychology or Ph.D. in Professional Scientific Psychology degrees. Additionally, 14 ethnic minority students are currently working on graduate degrees in psychology. And just with those numbers, Utah State University is a leader in the field of training American-Indian psychologists. These graduates often return to native communities where they provide much needed psychological services, as well as serve on as successful role models for community members. In addition to her recruitment and retention efforts, Dr. Barcus in the American Indian Support Project, students host an annual convention in cooperation with the Society of Indian Psychologists and I just tell Dr. Barcus that I’d go this summer so… I'm making it public to commitment. The 24th annual convention of the American Indian Psychologists and Psychology Graduate Students in the Bear Lake Retreat was held in June 2010. And preparations are developing for the 25th convention that will be held this summer. This convention hosts a Society of Indian Psychologists’ business meeting and Dr. Barcus is of course a past President of the Society of Indian Psychologists. So please help me welcome Dr. Carolyn Barcus.

00:03:25
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS Thank you Jill. I want to thank the winter roundtable coordinators for honoring me with this award. And receiving award that honors Janet Helms is truly an honor to me and I appreciate having been invited. It’s a bit anxiety-provoking I have to admit. I try to imagine what I know that you do not know as well. I decided to tell you about who I am, what I do and what I have learned. When I think about the differences in the culture I come from and where I assume most of you come from, I have to smile. 

00:04:05
Training Ethnic Minority Graduate Students in a White Man’s Program: Don’t Get Bucked Off! Carolyn Barcus, EdD Utah State University Bear River Ranch 

00:04:05
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS This is Bear River Ranch. This is my life where I live now. It is 55 acres on the Bear River in northern Utah. This is the south hay barn. You can see the north hay barn clear to the right. Here are the horses, and Eddie the Burro. 

00:04:35
Eddie the Burro 

00:04:40
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS A pelican west of the pond, a sandhill crane. The sandhill cranes raise their young here as do the male deer, the wild turkeys and the pheasants. I'm rural and of the West through and through and cities make me nervous. I'm advised to be an urban warrior. I think I was an urban warrior yesterday, because I came early to see the American Museum of Natural History. Ethel Toback frequently comes to our convention and she said, "If you ever come to New York, come and see the museum." And then I walked from there back to my hotel. That was pretty brave, don’t you think? Truthfully, I would rather be here. 

00:05:35
Fishing for Supper 

00:05:35
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS That section corner lake, my dog Keelie, and the fish that I catch. 

00:05:40
Heading North 

00:05:45
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS I grew up on a small cattle ranch on the Blackfeet Reservation, our northwards pasture fence is the Canadian border. You can see Canada up here and the ranch is here. I’ll talk about it a little later. But Logan, Utah is about in here. I have ridden from Green Canyon all along this black line up to Old Faithful in Yellowstone Park. Then you see that area in between that’s where they take the bad bears. We skipped over that and we picked up north of West Yellowstone and are now in Montana headed for the ranch. This is the ranch. 

00:06:30
Ranch on the Blackfeet Reservation 

00:06:30
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS It’s the east side of Glacier Park. That mountain on the right is Old Chief who sits by himself, which is a sacred mountain of the Blackfeet. You heard nurses talk about… nurses talk about Chief Mountain. They took their picture from the Canadian side. 

00:06:50

00:06:55
Ranch on the Blackfeet Reservation 

00:06:55
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS This is the ranch where I grew up, the house, the barn. It’s getting pretty run down now, the granary, chicken coop. The ridge you can see clear to the north up here is in Canada. I grew up poor, but I did not know I was poor. Everyone I knew was poor, so it didn’t mean anything to me. I never went hungry. I do still winter(ph) on a sea cloth made of the kind of small print of flower sacks used to be made of, because my mother would make blouses from those flower sacks. We never had indoor plumbing or central heating, so we packed our water from the well and hauled wood from the mountains. Electricity reached the ranch when I was 16. I rode 5 miles to attend school in the first grade. And when there were not enough children in the valley to qualify for our school, my mother moved to town each winter so that we could go to school in Browning. Dad stayed alone on the ranch to take care of the livestock. By the time I was in high school, I was able to sell a (inaudible ) to buy school clothes, so I no longer had to wear flower sack shirts. As I look back on my growing up here, I recognize the privilege I had. I was surrounded by family. I was free to ride my horse and free to be… Free to be and I had meaningful work to do. But I grew up angry, because nobody cared about how I felt. In cowboy Indian culture, feelings don’t count and you learn to be rough and tough. I was good at chopping wood though. 

00:08:35
Mom & Dad 

00:08:35
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS This is my mother, my dad, and my older brother Steve. I was the first member of my family to go to college. My father completed the third grade, my mother completed the eighth grade. Many years ago, when I had completed my doctorate, my mother said to me, “If I could do life again, I would want to do what you are doing.” 

00:09:00
Mom in Her Grain Field 

00:09:00
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS My mother’s time and place since history were her limitations. She assured that I had the privilege of going to college. She never had that opportunity. In 1961, I graduated from Montana State University in physical education. Looking back over my life, what were the turning points and who were the influential people? Going to college was a turning point and my mother was an influential person. She taught me from a young age that I could do anything I put my mind to. I have discovered that’s not exactly true. But her faith in me was a rock on which to stand. I knew that I did not have a life on the rest, which was relearned when I went back after two years of teaching. I returned to help my older brother Steve that you saw in the picture after he lost his right arm in an electrical accident. At the end of the year, I went on Indian relocation to Denver, Colorado. I'm not sure of Denver in the 1960’s, it's a city to you, but it sure was to me and it was a pretty steep learning curve about living in a city. But living and teaching in Colorado was a stepping stone to graduate school in Utah. 

00:10:15
Northern Utah 

00:10:20
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS This is northern Utah. Several of these folk are… are students. At Utah State University, I earned a master's degree in physical education and went on to earn my doctorate in psychology. I stayed in Utah after graduating and have now lived in northern Utah since 1968. Ironically, the family of my maternal grandmother were sent by the Mormon Church from that valley where I live now to colonize in Canada when she was 12. That was in the late 1800’s and they went by wagon. I'm making that journey by horseback. I bought a 100-year-old home on a corner lot Providence in Cache Valley south of Logan when I was in graduate school. I paid $10,000 for it putting 500 down, which I borrowed and paid a $100 per month payment. I lived there 29 years and moved from there to Bear River Ranch in the year 2000. There was nothing but old fences on the land when I bought it. I said, this is the only ranch I will ever build and I'm going to build it in a way I want it to be and then I will work to pay for it. I've been working to pay for it. Everything is paid off now except the house. An 8-acre feet of irrigation water from the Bear River recently acquired. What a blessing the water is! 

00:11:45
Bear River Water 

00:11:50
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS There we are putting an intake hose into the river. 

00:11:50
Watering with Bear River Water 

00:11:55
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS And you can't see the sprinklers. I was disappointed because the ones that sprays 60 feet somehow we lost the… the pictures for it. But this is the hay barn on top by the house. And you can see the irrigation water if you look closely enough and I love it. Let’s talk about work. I have always worked. Growing up on a ranch I worked with cattle. I worked with horses. I built fence. I hauled hay, Jacque is nodding her head. In country where the wind comes down off the Rocky Mountains about 70% of the time. West of Browning, the hub of the Blackfeet Reservation, the wind blows the train off the track on a regular basis. 

00:12:50
Work 

00:12:55
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS Now, I work here. I'm the one in the tractor, right over there. In graduate school I had many as three part-time jobs at a time to pay for school. I loved school and I have loved my work. I knew so little, I had to catch up and there are so many skills to develop. When you grew up in cowboy Indian country, your EQ, emotional quotient, is pretty low. Being a PET internal(ph) coach is pretty much more the same. I was 30 years old before I learned wanting to hit something meant you were angry. And now I know anger is frequently a secondary emotion that protects you from feeling hurt and fear. 

00:13:40
Professional Work Utah State Prison System Intermountain Intertribal School Utah State University 

00:13:40
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS My professional work after graduating was in the prison system with people incarcerated for drug and alcohol offenses. I worked for over five years at Intermountain Intertribal School in Brigham City, Utah as a Mental Heath Specialist and then as a Service Unit Director, and if you know anything about Indian Health Service, you get called a SUD, a Service Unit Director. I worked there until it closed in 1984. Intermountain School was an off-reservation boarding school run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs with health services provided by Indian Health Service. When Intermountain School closed, mentors from USU asked me to come back and help them with the Navajo School psychologist training that they had started. But no one was graduating. Of the 20 original recruits, seven graduated with their master's in school psychology. Three of them are still in my life. 

00:14:45
Lorraine & Danny Carolyn 

00:14:45
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS This is Lorraine Menuz, Danny Keskoli(ph) and Carolyn Thomas Morris. Carolyn Thomas Morris is the only one who went on to get her PhD. 

00:15:00
Therapist 40 years doing individual and group therapy 5 years of sex offender treatment 24 years of treating sexual abuse victims 

00:15:00
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS I have been doing therapy for 40 years. I am a therapist. I do individual and group therapy. In the last 26 years, I worked at a treatment agency for women who had been sexually abused and for sexual offenders doing groups with both. Probably one of the most powerful experiences in my professional career was putting an offender group together with a victim group making sure that no victims ever got re-victimized. Those women came back to group and they said, “Carolyn, those men don’t feel.” And that’s exactly true. That is the reason that you can do what you do if you are a sex offender is that you do not feel, therefore you have no empathy. The most powerful learning for the sex offenders is that it really penetrated(ph) how much those women hurt. Currently, the majority of my private practices with the survivors of the horror of extreme childhood sexual abuse, most of whom are women. I have found them to be smart, strong, talented, and stubborn. My mother used to say I was stubborn, (inaudible ) headedness. I might be a stubborn as they are, but I'm not sure I could live to what they lived through. I believe that the abused children who were not that strong and talented and smart and stubborn, died. They either killed themselves or got someone else to kill them or they are hopelessly insane. Wonderful, wonderful women, who are confused, scared, sad, angry, and full of shame. They have taught me so much about courage, about persistence, and about love. I'm a better person and a better mentor, because of what they have taught me. "Taking the leap, trusting there will be stars", and the citation is over there. The rural multicultural emphasis area within the combined PhD program, serves as a community for the students interested in issues of diversity and culture. This includes, ethnic minority students, GLBT students, as well as majority students who are allies and have multicultural interests. 

00:18:00
American Indian Support Project Student Recruitment and Retention Create an interdependent community within an independent program Provides support Financial Academic Social 

00:18:00
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS The support project provides the services that you see up here. We do student recruitment and retention. The good news that I got on my phone just a few minutes ago is that we have two ethnic minority students who applied for internships this year and they both matched and that is good news. Creating an interdependent community within an independent program, there are not many places more white than Utah. And being able to have a community that interdependent people can call a community is a very important thing. We provide support, financial, academic, and social support. I believe that ethnic minority students should have tuition fees, and whatever other financial charges there are, paid for them. That’s my own belief. And we pretty much do that. We… That’s one of our recruitment. (inaudible ) is… We promise you that that’s what we will do and we do. 

00:19:20
A Multicultural Social 

00:19:25
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS In terms of social support, a traditional annual social event includes the opening part like social, which is what you see here. This is when they first come. A multicultural day of thanks, a spring part like social, as well as a graduation celebration for rural multicultural graduates and their families. These frequently are held at Bear River Ranch. This is my front yard. Here we’re trying to get organized for a prayer. Horseback riding, four wheelers, hiking, are all available. 

00:20:05
Fun More Fun 

00:20:10
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS And at first you can’t have a social without food. This particular student right here is responsible for having to put this together. I picked the picture, she made it work. Here we are preparing to go on a horseback ride. 

00:20:25
Hit the Road 

00:20:25
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS Here they are heading on a horseback ride. Many of the students have never ridden and so it’s a new experience for them. I can tell you when Angelou first got on a horse, she was absolutely terrified. Now she rides with us on a regular basis because we are a community. 

00:20:45
We Are A Community Convention 7amp; Retreat June 27 and 28, 2011 24th Annual Convention of American Indians Psychologists and Psychology Graduate Students Retreat June 24, 25, 26, 2011 The Medicine Man this year is Albert White Hat Sr. from the Rosebud Reservation 

00:20:50
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS One of the other things that the support project does is put on an annual convention. This is the one that’s coming up. This is the 24th Annual Convention of American Indian Psychologists and Psychology Graduate Students. Hosting this convention is an honor to us at Utah State University. For years, it was known as the Utah Conference. Now, since we put it on in conjunction with the Society of Indian Psychologists, it is known as the SIP Convention, which is fine with me. 

00:21:25
SIP Convention 

00:21:25
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS It is held every June. June 27th and 28th is the convention. June 24th, 25th, and 26th is the retreat. The medicine man this year is Albert White Hat Sr. from the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota. That’s an important thing to me having a medicine person available, because many navy students did not have a chance to get in touch with any kind of native spirituality. And so, having a medicine person there is important. The other thing that’s important is that this guy is for real. He is a real medicine person. There are a lot of wannabe medicine people out there and I'm very careful about not having wannabe folk. The convention is held at Utah State. Spero Manson from the National Center of American Indian and Alaska Native Research, two of our graduates, Carolyn Thomas Morris and Christopher Morris. 

00:22:35
Retreat Center at Bear Lake 

00:22:35
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS The Bear Lake Retreat Center is held on a beautiful, beautiful 30-mile long lake. The spiritual leader or medicine person will talk on Saturday evening after dinner and be available to talk with people, to lead a sweat, to perform a pipe ceremony, to teach those who are interested. 

00:22:55
Horse Camp 

00:23:00
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS And here is the horse camp. You might recognize that fellow right there, that’s Morris(ph). He went on horseback ride with us. The horse camp is catch as catch can and where we hold it and they closed our favorite place to hold it. My long-term goal and dream is to have a permanent horse camp and I'm getting closer to that dream I think. 

00:23:30
She May be Praying 

00:23:30
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS I think she’s probably praying. And I can tell you she rode that horse up the mountain. 

00:23:40
She Rode Up the Mountain 

00:23:40
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS Utah State students stay at the horse camp, because I wouldn’t let 'em stay at the retreat center. 

00:23:45
USU Students 

00:23:45
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS Those are soft beds. I want to add some thoughts about the retreat. Originally, the retreat was held only at the Bear Lake training center, which is a modern USU facility on the shore of the lake and it’s still held there, but there are only 32 beds there. I wanted to have the horses available, so I created the horse camp. Those who want to camp in the mountains, sleep in a tent, live outdoors, and eat great food, because we have cooks at the horse camp, stay at the horse camp and it’s gotten so over the years more and more people choose to stay at the horse camp. We take good care of people. I was just telling Jill that we will make her comfortable and warm, we being the wranglers and the cooks. The retreat is about spirituality and community and the horse camp embodies these important aspects of native culture. Talking around the campfire for half of the night is common and many say they learn as much or more about what’s going on in Indian country at the retreat as they do at the convention. 

00:25:00
Convention The two day convention is devoted to the science of Indian psychology, what is going on in Indian Country, and mentoring. 

00:25:00
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS The two-day convention is devoted to the science of Indian psychology, what is going on in Indian country and to mentoring. The professionals who come in, spend a lot of time mentoring the graduate students who come in. 

00:25:20
Elders Panel 

00:25:20
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS This is one of my favorite slides. On the far left is Doug McDonald, who… I don’t know about ages, but I'm sure he is older than I am. And he says that he is the first to enroll tribal member to achieve a PhD in clinical psychology. It could be true. (Inaudible ) was the first person that we know of to receive a PhD in one of the other research psychologies. Next is Jerry Mohatt. Jerry Mohatt is a white man. He is also fluent in the Lakota language, recently deceased, finished his years in Alaska. He received a Distinguished Elders award at the recent multicultural summit. Next is (inaudible ), who is Dine which is same as Navajo. He spent most of his working time in Canada, Brandon University. And Dan Foster, he probably don’t even think of himself as an elder, but he certainly is an elder to our conference. 

00:26:40
And, Joseph 

00:26:40
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS And Joseph Trimble is also one of our elders. The convention is an opportunity for native graduate students to present their research to an interested, knowledgeable, and supportive audience, as well as a form for native professionals to share their own work. Young psychologists frequently start here. 

00:27:05
Joe Gone Doug McDonald as a Student Doug & His Students Jacque & Her Students 

00:27:05
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS And bring their students back. Jacque is the incoming president of Society of Indian Psychologists. 

00:27:15
The more traditional the student, the more interdependent they will be. Rural people are interdependent people, with an independent sense of self Meet our rural psychologist 

00:27:15
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS I don’t know what you know about interdependence. But the more interdependent the student is, it correlates with tradition, the more traditional they are, the more interdependent they are. Rural people are also interdependent people, with an independent sense of self as opposed to an interdependent sense of self. 

00:27:45
Renee Galliher, our rural psychologist 

00:27:45
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS This is our rural psychologist, Renee Galliher. And she spends a whole lot of her time counseling with our ethnic minority students, mentoring our ethnic minority students and is a great mentor. 

00:28:00
Society of Indian Psychologists SIP President Pam Deters 

00:28:00
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS The Society of Indian Psychologists is the professional organization of Indian psychologists. Pam Deters is the current President. I watched Bertha Holiday(ph), mentor the (inaudible ) of the four ethnic professional organizations during her time in office of ethnic minority affairs of APA and I was a recipient of that mentoring. A small professional organization does not have a CEO or a staff to carry on business and provide continuity over the years, besides everybody is a long way away from each other. Fortunately, we do have a list, so we can stay in touch. The Society of Indian Psychologists does not have a home office, except the Utah State University where their annual business meeting is held each June. USU takes some of the responsibility of providing support and continuity for this important organization, The Voice of Indian Psychology for this Nation. I consider this an important mentoring service. 

00:29:15
Mentoring is Different Do not wait for leaders; do it alone, person to person. - Mother Teresa 

00:29:15
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS And the time in mind, I would like to talk about mentoring. I do not claim to be an expert in mentoring and many of you could probably talk about it better than I can. Let me share my thoughts and then we can discuss this thing called mentoring. The only thing I can think that this slide has to do with mentoring is that mentoring is truly a beautiful thing. On the trip from Cache Valley to southern Utah… to southern Montana, there were lots and lots of beautiful places. Mentoring is different than teaching or coaching or training or counseling and therapy or parenting or advising or friendship. It can be a dual process with any one of these things. It is about the relationship and it has no ties except respect and caring, no college credits, no tests or payments or contracts. But in traditional native cultures, it was a kinship responsibility. And I love that I can work both ways. I can mentor you to be a horse packer in the wilderness and you can mentor me in the use of technology. It is hard to see where it begins and it can be never-ending and that’s certainly the way it seems trying to get me up to speed with technology. It’s… It’s kind of like kids who start learning English when they start school, because school is a progressive process. They're always about three years behind in terms of their academic language. And I am way farther behind than that in technology. 

00:31:15
Mentoring: Being vs. Doing We make a living by what we get, we make a life by what we give. - Winston Churchill 

00:31:15
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS Are you a mentor? Or do you do mentoring? I believe there is a difference. I am a mentor. It’s not something that I do sometimes, it’s who I am. It is not how I started out. It’s where I’ve ended up. I think about my friend and mentor Joseph Trimble. We lived several states apart and Joseph still finds ways to mentor me, because Joseph is a mentor. He is a mentor to all of us in Indian psychology. Multicultural psychology, cross-cultural psychology, his students, Joseph, I believe if you ever try to not be a mentor, you would have to work hard at it. My sphere of influence is nowhere near as broad as that of Joseph Trimble. I mentor students and faculty in psychology at USU and those in the Indian… Society of Indian Psychologists and those who would like to learn about horses and about wilderness. I received an email from one of our majority students last weekend. His 10-year-old daughter loves horses and she has been riding with me. He offered to take her on a ski outing and she said, "I would rather go riding with Carolyn than go skiing." He said, “Is she crazy?” I said, “No way. That is one smart woman.” And I'm glad to mentor Clara about horses. 

00:32:55
Mentoring is Timeless 

00:32:55
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS Mentoring is timeless. It’s not confined to education or psychology. I believe that mentors have mentored young people throughout time. I have an elder who mentors me in the operation of haying equipment. That’s me haying our meadow and in driving a team. I told him that I was taking him with me to New York. 

00:33:20
Culturally Competent Mentoring I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. - Maya Angelou 

00:33:20
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS Over the past 26 years, I have watched faculty from an independent culture, an ethnic minority student from an interdependent culture learn how to work together in research and education. Faculty you use competitive processes in their research team will lose the ethnic minority students, even those students who may be very interested in the research area. They will be uncomfortable with competing. Utilizing cooperative methods that group majority and ethnic minority students will be a more effective method. Showing respect to all students is obviously good social skills. But ethnic minority students are usually more sensitized to lack of respect, that whole microaggression thing, and they will be sensitive to microaggressions. And students are in a very vulnerable position to be able to speak up in the moment. Being the oldest member of our faculty, I helped to hire our entire combined program faculty and I am very proud of them. They are young and talented, energetic, and open to learning and they are at varying stages of cultural competency and sometimes they make mistakes and they offend. 

00:34:55
Examples: Short on Grace It is always wise to look ahead, but difficult to look farther than you can se. - Winston Churchill 

00:34:55
DR. CAROLYN BARCUS Angelou and I thought that this particular quote on mentoring by Winston Churchill, "It is always wise to look ahead, but difficult to look farther than you can see." And I think that’s the problem with people who do not have skills in cultural competency as they don’t see what it is that they are doing. Let me give you some examples from Utah State University and I will tell you beforehand this is really very embarrassing to me. These came directly from the students. Prior to playing a video, a professor asked an ethnic minority student if she is comfortable with the class watching the video. The video is a powerful account of discrimination specific to this student’s racial group. Having a faculty member telling an ethnic minority student that they need to be white in their presentation skills during a clinical comp. Having faculty members only teach about majority culture and no diversity. Diversity issue is only being brought up when ethnic minority students brought them up, which then they experience microaggressions from peers due to making a big deal. Having a faculty member engage in the microaggression in the classroom, when the acculturative stress scale was brought up in class for class discussion, majority students, as well as the faculty member who is a white male, stated that they felt threatened by the discussion after they undermined the experience of acculturative stress by saying that everyone experiences stress. And therefore, why would we care to examine this ethnic minority from ethnic minority clients? Faculty not saying anything when microaggressions occur in the classroom allowing it to happen and not addressing it. Faculty interpreting by not volunteering and competing for projects as disinterest when I would have seemed rude and arrogant if I had volunteered. In my thinking if I was a good person do the project he would select me. I shouldn’t push to be the one chosen for the project. There are some good things that the students sent to me. 

00:37:15
Examples: Moments of Grace You cannot do a kindness too soon, for you never know how soon it will be too late. - Ralph Waldo Emerson 

00:37:20
CAROLYN G. BARCUS A professor responding to feedback about the lack of multicultural topics and classes and to the problem ethnic minority students who are having in their poor heart. By adding readings on white privilege and microagressions to the pre-practicum class even though we are already weeks into the semester. Professor holding get togethers to watch movies and documentaries with multicultural social justice in her home on weekends and being willing to meet in her home. The instructor asking her psychology class if any student had experiences with a different culture although the general tendency is to look at the minority student in the class, she did not. She made me feel on the same plain as all other students. Luckily one fellow student talked about how his service in the military had given him exposure to other countries and cultures. I felt that I was not referred to automatically, she made my option to speak up. I applaud her for this. Another professor encouraged students to study in groups for her class. This in my opinion, considers different learning styles, some of which may be rooted in collectivistic backgrounds. It was helpful to have someone understand this approach and it was optional of course. Last one, discussing another professor during my time under her mentorship she has been able to validate my experience in different ways. She has listened to my frustration with the community and has engaged in supportive conversations regarding cultural clashes from the personal perspective.

Examples: Moments of Grace You cannot do a kindness too soon, for you never know how soon it will be too late. - Ralph Waldo Emerson 

00:39:05
CAROLYN G. BARCUS One more thing just for your education. That peak right there is a Grand Teton, in the Teton Range west of Jackson Hole, Wyoming. We’re looking at it from the top basically.

More on Mentoring Mentoring is a brain to pick, an ear to listen, and a push in the right direction. John Crosby 

00:39:20
CAROLYN G. BARCUS This next one is Death Canyon. That if you are in Jackson, in the town of Jackson in Wyoming, and you look west of the Teton you see a big V and that’s Death Canyon. It comes up the canyon and then it curves back and it leaves a shelf that’s about as wide as this room called the Death Canyon Shelf. And so you can ride along that shelf going north and be even with the Grand Teton. More on mentoring. Our students are encouraged to ask for help if they have a problem. Talk to us about what is happening. We cannot help you if we do not know what is going on in your world. Stay in touch with student… Staying in touch with students is the most important thing I do. I believe that they know that they are important to me and I will help if I know they need help. There is no need for shame if you need help. I ask for help all of the time, we wouldn’t have this wonderful pictures up here if I didn’t have help. If a student asks for help, we need to listen. Even if we are busy and stressed, we need to listen. If we do not, the message is that they are non-important and they will not ask again.

Don’t Get Bucked Off Mentoring lessons to be learned from horses 

00:40:45
CAROLYN G. BARCUS I would like to conclude with don’t get bucked off. Here are some basic axioms for success in your work with horses and wilderness packing, developed by (inaudible ) our Director of Training and myself. She is the one who has gone on the entire trip with me. 

00:41:05
Seek Quality…In People 

00:41:05
CAROLYN G. BARCUS Seek quality in people… 

00:41:10
Seek Quality…In People and in Horses …And In Equipment 

00:41:10
CAROLYN G. BARCUS …in people and horses, that’s (inaudible ) and in equipment, and that’s my dodge truck, cool truck. Be a source of positives. 

00:41:25
Be a Source of Positives 

00:41:30
CAROLYN G. BARCUS There is a fine line between respect and fear. We are seeking respect and positive relationships. 

00:41:35
Give Them Many Experiences 

00:41:40
CAROLYN G. BARCUS Give them many experiences. 

00:41:40
And New Challenges 

00:41:40
CAROLYN G. BARCUS That’s Upper Palisades Lake They developed confidence and calmness in meeting new challenges. 

00:41:50
Not All Horses Can Be Trained To Do All Things A mismatch sometimes doesn’t go well 

00:41:55
CAROLYN G. BARCUS Not all horses can be trained to do all things. This is a broken packsaddle, after this turned out not to be a packhorse, but a bucking horse. And what that means in the packing world is now you have twice as much stuff as you can fit on your horse and so you have to make a trip, clear out to the truck, come clear back, pick up the rest of the stuff with your only remaining pack horse and ride back out to the truck. Be honest, no one to cut your losses. A bad fit doesn’t work for you or the horse and everyone can get hurt, (inaudible ) did get hurt in this trek, because she was in front of me and her horse couldn’t tell what was going on when the packhorse started bucking and her packhorse crashed into her, knocked her horse down so she had… swell in her legs were about this big round, both legs. She is really very tough and kept going. 

00:43:05
Not Everyone Can Train All Horses Learn what you can train and cannot train Know yourself and be honest; you need to learn as well If you get in over your head, get help!!! 

00:43:10
CAROLYN G. BARCUS Not everyone can train all horses. Learn what you can train and cannot train. Know yourself and be honest, you need to learn as well and if you get in over your head, get help, consult. If you get anyway over your head it is a disturbance to you and to the horse. Ultimately the horse pays the price and you walk away. 

00:43:40
Know There Will Be Struggles 

00:43:40
CAROLYN G. BARCUS Know there will be struggles. This is Eddie dragging me down the driveway. This is the vet coming to save me. Stay as calm as you want the horse to be and seek a positive solution. Preserve the relationship. You are looking for respect, if I get up and whack Eddie with the shovel, that’s not respect and he will be frightened and that’s not respect. 

00:44:15
Offenses Will Happen 

00:44:20
CAROLYN G. BARCUS Offenses will happen. You may need to take the lead in addressing the rupture in the relationship. Act with good manners and ask for good manners. 

00:44:35
Approach Gently 

00:44:35
CAROLYN G. BARCUS Approach gently. You can’t do anything if you can’t get your arm around him. 

00:44:45
Check Your Horses Regularly… And Don’t Let Them Get Too Far Away Horses (Too Far Away!) 

00:44:45
CAROLYN G. BARCUS Check your horses regularly and don’t let them get too far away. Here are the horses way down in the willows. What is the worry? If they get too far away, pretty soon you won’t have any horses, so keep good track of them. 

00:45:05
Teach Them to Stake 

00:45:05
CAROLYN G. BARCUS Teach them to stake, so that if they tangled they don’t panic and hurt themselves. They need to learn to wait and to know that they can have help. If it is a bit uncomfortable to wait, probably should still wait. 

00:45:20
Don’t Confuse… Lack of Opportunity or Early Mistreatment as Poor Quality 

00:45:25
CAROLYN G. BARCUS Don’t confuse lack of opportunity or early mistreatment as poor quality. This is Eddie. A horse’s foot is not supposed to look like a pot… pop can, tall and it’s not supposed to look like a pancake. The vet trimmed this foot so it’s getting closer, when I get back she’ll come back and trim them again, because he had been badly neglected. Good treatment will reveal the quality. I hope for you a passion, a plan and persistence in all that you do. 

00:46:05

00:46:10
CAROLYN G. BARCUS I will make it to Canada. 

00:46:10

00:46:10
CAROLYN G. BARCUS I appreciate you for letting me share with you. Happy trails. Thank you.
