Janina Fisher, Ph.D. 

00:00:15
JANINA FISHER We're about to meet Kay who I believe I've... I've done a counsel to her before and I believe at this point she is 23-years-old. She has two children uh... one born when she was 18, so one who's four, five and a little boy and uh... and lives with her partner in a very, very long-term unstable and sometimes domestically violent relationship. And she's brought a question to this consultation. And the question she brought is umm... why do I keep going back to him? Why can't I let him go? Why do I seem to be attracted to men who are dangerous or to men umm... who leave and come back and leave and come back repeatedly? So I'm gonna help her address that. Uh... Here is her history very briefly. She is... was adopted, she's an adopted child, adopted at three months to parents very, very stable, well meaning parents umm... who she says didn't understand the... what it would be to adopt an infant who had already suffered attachment failure. And... And, so they were totally unprepared for a baby that couldn't attach well to them. And began to have a significant emotional and behavioral problems umm... in childhood. And many, many chaotic years occurred thereafter. She was hospitalized many times in residential programs. Her family stuck with her and stuck with family therapy. So that they wouldn't lose the relationship and hopefully could be a stabilizing presence in her life. And now today she is more stable other than in this relationship with her boyfriend. So, let me talk a little bit about the point of view which... with which I'm coming in and which I introduced to her when we met for a consultation probably two years prior. The model that I am... am bringing to the table is a model that I have developed and I am writing a book about called Healing the Fragmented Selves of Trauma Survivors. Umm... It is an integration of a theory well, well known in Europe with sensory motor psychotherapy, internal family systems and techniques drawn from ego state therapy umm... which is a well accepted technique in the hypnotic world. The Structural Disassociation Theory, I very, very much like as a kind of template for understanding clients. And I like it because it has a very solid neurobiological foundation. It's not a metaphor, it's not an idea. It's really built on what we know about the brain and the body. And the theory says, that under conditions of traumatic attachment, abuse, neglect and all the other types of trauma to which children can be exposed, we are designed to split along the lines of a brain that's compartmentalized. You know, we talk about the brain or my memory as if we had one memory and one brain, but the brain is composed of many different structures, all of which contribute very different things to our experience. When we remember something it requires the umm... interaction or the cooperation of many different areas of the brain. Some holding visual images, some the narrative, some the gut, visceral sensations, some the muscle memories uh... olfactory tactile and auditory memories and the emotional memories. So, the theory says that when a child is exposed to a threat the natural split between the left and right brains which is greater in early childhood, the... the area that allows the two to talk together only develops past the age of 12, where it grows slowly through childhood. But does it really do its job of creating communication from left brain to right and back until 13 and above 12, 13 or above. So, the theory says the left brain as scientific researchers have noted for 20 years, the left brain is very organized, sequential, goal directed, verbal, not in touch with emotions. And that's the side of the personality that Onno van der Hart, Ellert Nijenhuis and Kathy Steele, the authors of this theory umm... have hypothesized holds what I call the going on with normal life part, the part of all of us and I... I know therapists experience this. We may be going through terrible time personally, umm... suffering losses, uh... crisis in our lives and yet we go into the office, we sit down with a client and something clicks on and we're there and we're able to do our jobs and we're able... and actually the thoughts of the crisis, the loss often recede because we're focused on what's right here before us that needs to be done. That's the essence of the going on with normal life itself. No matter what the disaster, we keep on keeping on. The right brain, part of the personality, very coincidentally brain scan studies show traumatic memories are encoded on the right hemisphere side of the brain in... in an area called the limbic system. So, uh... it really fits. The right brain is the survival brain because it's good at intuition, instinct, reading body language, it's not verbal, it's emotional and it's action oriented. And so, the theory says that that split allows the child to keep on being a normal kid, to get up and have breakfast, to get dressed and go to school, to do his homework, to you know, love to run, to get a bunch of... of buddies together to play a pickup game of baseball. So, so this side of the personality has the capacity to access both the desire for and the ability for normal life functioning. The right hemisphere side of the personality holds the trauma responses, not the narrative memories. But the survival responses, fight, flight, freeze, submit and cry for help. The right brain side of the personality keeps scanning for danger while the left side is planning high school graduation. The theory goes on to say that with complex or chronic traumatic exposure, there begin to be more splitting along this right brain side, so that we develop a part or self-state that holds the fight response, hyper vigilance, readiness for action, readiness to protect. A fight part or self-state ready to flee. A freeze self-state that holds fear as an alarm and freezing like a deer in the headlights. Umm... Submission, a self-holding, is the submission response umm... which includes umm... I pretended, I was asleep, I floated up to the ceiling, umm... I don't remember what happened next. There is a physical collapse, a numbing and often an unconsciousness which is very adaptive when you have to submit. And then last, but not least, we have the cry for help response, the very first animal defense of all babies, they can cry and if they are lucky enough to have parents who cultivate secure attachment, when they cry somebody comes and but when you or a baby who has been given up for adoption, your... your fate as it were is in the hands of the orphanage, of the foster mother. It may be quality of the attachment that baby is going to experience is going to vary greatly. When that baby cries for help will someone come? And... And when no one comes, umm... what the body first does is go into an alarm or fight state and then it gives up and goes into a submission state. Attachment researchers have seen that shut down state in babies as young as three months. So, Kay has... had a long and she... bless her, she calls it an attachment disorder. Umm... You hear from her symptoms that mostly likely in most settings Kay would be diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder. Unfortunate and she's had that diagnosis of course, many, many times. It hasn't helped her to resolve the symptoms. The approach that I'm going to offer her is going to be attachment focused, umm... it's going to keep this model in... in mind because I'm going to assume that her going on with normal life self is struggling because her cry for help part is still crying for somebody to come. Still yearning for someone to prioritize her, to make her feel special. Alan Shore(ph) says all children long to be seen through the sparkling eyed gaze of their parents. She didn't get that sparkle until she was adopted and by then umm... she had a negative rather than positive reaction. I'm also going to look for the activation of the fight part because the attachment seeking vulnerability of the cry for help part often elicits the uh... the activation of the fight response umm... because vulnerability makes children more, umm... more vulnerable obviously to predators. So, let's... let's meet with Kay and uh... actually I am just remembering, I must have done the counsel to her four years ago because it was before she had her oldest child. Now she's the mother of a four-year-old and I think the little one is two. So, let's see her as she comes in. I wish I had a pre-imposed... I wish I could show you the meeting we had four years ago, so you could see how she's grown. So... So, it's nice to see you again and its actually this is very nice because it's kind of there is a little before and after. 

00:14:40
KAY Yes. Definitely. 

00:14:40
JANINA FISHER Yeah. Yeah. So what are the main things that, I mean your circumstances are different, but what's the main thing that's different about you? 

00:14:50
KAY Probably that I'm a mom. 

00:14:55
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:14:55
KAY I don't know... well, I have a boyfriend now that it's like maybe I feel like is in relationship to maybe when I was younger because it's like I've just... I'm so attached to him. I didn't have like somebody like this in my life, that was like so constant before, so it's like, maybe it's like, everyone just says it's probably like me because my adoption, my attachment issues lead to, like now I have someone serious in my life, it's not my parents, it's not my children, it's not my friend or a random boyfriend, so it's been a while. So I feel like whatever my issues are, are like super coming out on my relationship and like... so I feel like it's really more like relevant of my issues that I've always had. But like when I had a boyfriend for three months, it would be, you couldn't really see deep enough because it was only three months, or it would be like (inaudible ). Its' still hard, I still have attachment issues, but now it's like, so severe that it's like caused, like a lot more chaos in my life in that sense. 

00:15:55
JANINA FISHER And even though you're trying to keep your life really stable for your kids. 

00:16:00
KAY Oh yeah, most people probably think that it's very, very stable and I do, like I work, I... but there is always that one little piece in my life that's probably not stable. Everyone else says like if you meet me at work, you probably think it was like really stable but... 

00:16:15
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:16:15
KAY There is always that one little thing like that. 

00:16:20
JANINA FISHER And is that one little thing, the... the way that is it sort of but the conflict in the relationship or the way he treats you? 

00:16:30
KAY I feel like it's a very conflict and a very toxic. Everything is a conflict and it's just very toxic. So I don't know if it's one conflicts. Like one conflict that can be solved, I feel like it's more of like the relationships a conflict, so it's not like just one problem that we could overcome or it's not one person's behavior, as I feel like it's... 

00:16:55
JANINA FISHER It's just, it's as if you look at each other and you both get triggered. 

00:17:00
KAY Yes, yes. 

00:17:00
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:17:00
KAY He's also adopted with a very umm... 

00:17:00
JANINA FISHER Well. 

00:17:05
KAY I don't know, if it's much worse or better but along the lines of like it took a few months before he... so I don't... I don't know if there is anything to do with it but it could that he's very like, he was adopted at three months, I was adopted at three months. So it's like maybe we are similar and... 

00:17:20
JANINA FISHER Right and you both even though, I remember interviewing a young woman who said, well who was in an orphanage her first nine months of life, and she said, well it can't have affected me because I don't remember. 

00:17:35
KAY Yeah. 

00:17:35
JANINA FISHER But you guys are living proof that... 

00:17:40
KAY Yeah, I've heard that so many times and (inaudible ) I know he doesn't believe that it's affected. (inaudible ) when I know that it's affecting me is because I've gone, there is so much of this, so much therapy, boarding schools that have told me this but like if it wasn't for someone it would be like, what is three... three, four months of moving around, have to do with me now. Like I don't remember it, but I have... but yeah. 

00:18:00
JANINA FISHER Yeah. And having your own kids, has that also given you a different perspective on those first few months? 

00:18:10
KAY Yeah, that it really, really affects them because like I was more or like emotional when my daughter was born and she is more, I want to say, not high-strung but she's more affected, like she has trouble sleeping because it used to be like a lot of like moving around when she was like you know, we would rent rooms from people, so it was more like, I mean, I was always there, but even changing environments or moving from... 

00:18:35
JANINA FISHER Oh! 

00:18:35
KAY Like even when I was pregnant, I was like on the run with him for like the whole nine months. 

00:18:40
JANINA FISHER And... And was that the same boyfriend that you have now? 

00:18:45
KAY Yes. 

00:18:45
JANINA FISHER That you... okay. 

00:18:45
KAY I... We've had two kids together. 

00:18:50
JANINA FISHER Right. And... And I... so I think when I met you before, you broke with him. 

00:18:55
KAY Yeah, I maybe... 

00:18:55
JANINA FISHER Because I remember the on the run part. 

00:19:00
KAY So maybe just in the first few months but it probably only went... I mean it was better at first. 

00:19:05
JANINA FISHER Yes, yes. 

00:19:05
KAY So I maybe even, they say the pregnancy could even affect because it was always high-strung, high stress. 

00:19:10
JANINA FISHER Hmm-hmm. Yeah, there is something about pregnancy, I know the... the rates of... of umm... domestic violence go up when women are pregnant. 

00:19:20
KAY Yeah. Definitely. 

00:19:25
JANINA FISHER So, isn't that... which is so wild, its... 

00:19:25
KAY I know. I never even, if someone would have told me that before I got pregnant that everything would happen when I was preg... or started when I was pregnant, I would be like no. Like a guy or whatever couldn't do that when the girl is pregnant. And it's... 

00:19:40
JANINA FISHER With his baby. 

00:19:40
KAY Yeah, it's crazy to me but yeah, it definitely spurt then. 

00:19:45
JANINA FISHER Yeah. I want to say something uh... that uh... is an important piece of information I think for therapists to have. Pregnancy is a very, very dangerous time in the life of a woman in a domestic violence situation. Uh... There is a very longstanding literature that shows an increase in violent behavior umm... by batterers. Uh... We think that it has to do with their own early attachment, obviously unresolved, unconscious issues that when they see the... the baby growing umm... it triggers their own umm... attachment trauma or disturbance. But very, very important for therapists to know about because we... we never know when we might be working with a Kay. And uh... luckily umm... also there was an increase in violence during her pregnancies, both babies were okays and umm... and her normal life part uh... you know, the... the... the family and therapist when went for the first consult, umm... were really disturbed by the fact that the domestic violence was minimized. That it didn't... it didn't seem as if there was a picture over here on the normal life side that said, this is wrong, this is inappropriate, this shouldn't be happening. As soon as she was pregnant, it was like the lights turned on in her normal life parts half of the brain and she could see that there was something very, very, very wrong about it. Uh... So a very useful and important sign. So let's see what happens next? Let's go on. Yeah, yes, and I think, I mean, we think that, that's because of his early attachment. 

00:22:10
KAY Yes. Definitely. There is an attachment issue personally, and I know I am, but you would never think that he like maybe looking at him or like but if someone really looked, I think his attachment is very like his pumps are deep which probably... 

00:22:25
JANINA FISHER Yeah, yeah. And you know, this is actually really, it's umm... you and he maybe poster children umm... because I'm thinking you know, when kids have umm... early attachment, they call it disorganized attachment, umm... it can kind of go two ways. It can go more toward a pattern of being afraid of abandonment and separation anxiety and difficulty having, you know, being able to hold your own boundaries or it can go toward a sensitivity to the other person's making you feel okay, accompanied by rage, violence umm... etcetera. 

00:23:25
KAY Yeah. 

00:23:25
JANINA FISHER Is that... 

00:23:25
KAY Well, I feel like I'm more of the attached trying to like please trying to hold on and I feel like not that he's not attached because I think like he'll act like he's not attached, but like he's definitely the more violent. I don't care if you think like that side, but so I don't know. But I think deep down he's attached because he'll leave, but it's like he cannot be alone. 

00:23:50
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:23:50
KAY I'm not saying, I can... I can't be alone either, but I'm more of the like, I'd rather please someone to stay or beg someone to stay rather than get a different way. 

00:24:00
JANINA FISHER Right, right. Yeah and... and but I think what you're saying is that there is... that's more consistent, right. 

00:24:10
KAY Yes. 

00:24:10
JANINA FISHER Umm... I'll do anything to just keep us together. 

00:24:10
KAY Yes. 

00:24:15
JANINA FISHER And... And the person with his version of, they actually have a name for it. They call it uh... disorganized dismissing attachment. You know, so it's... it's more like pushing away, but not actually being able to leave. 

00:24:30
KAY Yes, yes, yes, yes. 

00:24:30
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:24:35
KAY Yeah. 

00:24:35
JANINA FISHER Right and umm... what... I have this great cartoon, I have to show it to you. That says, it's... it's a guy with his head in his hands, obviously not feeling great, umm... saying, I don't want to treat you like dirt and I don't want to lose you either. 

00:24:55
KAY Yes. He... My boyfriend does everything probably to get me to leave, everything under and above that you could think of that would make someone leave. But like never he doesn't want to leave and then I won't leave him either no matter what he does. 

00:25:10
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:25:10
KAY So that's probably, that's what I see like, he'll do anything to probably get me to leave and end the relationship but then it just, umm... never ends. 

00:25:20
JANINA FISHER Right and... and on the positive side, you know the two of you could work with it. It's... It could be a real opportunity to heal. 

00:25:35
KAY Definitely. 

00:25:35
JANINA FISHER But he'd have to see that there was something to heal. 

00:25:35
KAY Definitely. 

00:25:35
JANINA FISHER And that... that there is something very, very healing about the fact that no matter what you're not given up. 

00:25:45
KAY And there is something that I don't think other people see, but I think he loves me more than, I'm not saying more than my parents but I think he loves me more than I think I've been loved by... by people. So that there is something about him that's not just the cold, angry side of him because I think he knows how to love in a deeper way than a lot of people do or that are of like, gone and know a different side of me and he's still not... because I'm not perfect either. I've probably done a lot of things that make him want to leave too. And we have two kids together and at the end of the day it's like, we love our kids. 

00:26:20
JANINA FISHER Yeah. So she just said some important words. She said, he loves me in a deeper way. And this is often the story in domestic violence relationships. The... The woman, the girlfriend, the wife has a traumatic attachment history and therefore carries a yearning for the feelings that one would have in that very close bonded mother-infant relationship. So there is a yearning to feel special, a yearning to feel like the one, a yearning umm... to be healthy, yearning for proximity, feeling the sense of someone there. You know, I... I once asked a client years ago, what kept her in the relationship with her abusive husband? And she said, words I'll never forget, she said, you know, I think it's his, his smell and the warmth of his body next to me in the bed. Uh... And I remembered just really getting probably this... this is a very early state, right. As a baby, the things you'd remember would be the smell and the warmth. Even... Even children, if I ask my grandchildren about their attachment relationships to their mom and dad, they could give me some detail. They wouldn't say, I love the way she smells, I love the feeling of his physical presence. Even though I'm sure that's quite true. So... So I... I wanted to mention that because what happens in relationships such as the one between Kay and her boyfriend is that the... this re... reenactment, this recycling over and over again of the controlling, possessive behavior of... of the partner which I think Kay does a beautiful job of describing as an attachment disorder, that controlling, where are you? Uh... You call me right away. That makes her feel loved in a deeper way . And... And... And then the beating is simply the price that she pays to be loved in a deeper way. The unwillingness to care for her or care for the children umm... all of that can be written off because she feels that... that deeper way feeling. So let's go on because she's gonna get to a point where she can begin to question uh... this, but... but right now uh... even though when she talks about her kids, you can see that normal life part coming on. It's like somebody just turned on the lights. You can also see that attached part saying the equivalent of, but I love him, but I love him. But I love... I couldn't be apart from him. All right, let's see what happens next? Is he a good dad? 

00:30:10
KAY I think he has potential to be a good dad. But I think that right now, his mind is still maybe not mature. I don't know, he did three years in prison when he was 18. So I don't know that maybe it slow down the process of like because he came out at 21 or 22 and I think that it just kind of like getting a job, getting back into life. I think, he felt like he missed a lot of his life. So I think that he still maybe 18 like the before he went away. So I think that there is some maturing issue where or it's just like my job. Like, I can't leave, but you're gonna stay here, I'm gonna go out with my friends. But I think that's more common in young men who are just like want to still live their life while the mom takes care of the baby. So I don't know. He loves them. 

00:30:55
JANINA FISHER Right. Yeah. It worked better in the days of the cavemen and women, you know, because he'd go out on hunting. 

00:31:00
KAY Yes. 

00:31:00
JANINA FISHER And you stay home in the cave and take care of the kids. 

00:31:05
KAY Yeah, it was more straight forward. 

00:31:05
JANINA FISHER More straight forward and a little more even. 

00:31:05
KAY Yes, now, it's like both people have to work, both people have... I just think that in our circumstances, we don't have a lot of money, so it's never like he could just go to work and I could just stay home because we can't afford to do that. So that probably has umm... I feel like I'm working just as hard as he is. So when we both come home, I don't want to just do all the work and then you go out with your friends. So maybe that's where... 

00:31:30
JANINA FISHER Right, right. 

00:31:30
KAY He's a good dad. I mean, overall he like loves the kids. I just think that maybe he just has to grow up a little bit. All guys do, I think a little bit. 

00:31:40
JANINA FISHER And how old is he? 

00:31:40
KAY He's 25. 

00:31:40
JANINA FISHER He's 25. So he's really young. 

00:31:40
KAY He is young. And like I said, I think that guys and girls are like... I became a mom and like my whole life changed. But I think his life is taking a little longer to change. But I mean the kids love him. 

00:31:55
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:31:55
KAY You could tell just like when you're like, you know, he does (inaudible ) cry, he knows that he's made mistakes and it definitely affects him when he's like... 

00:32:05
JANINA FISHER Yeah. Is he... Is he softer since the kids were born in some ways? 

00:32:10
KAY In some ways. 

00:32:10
JANINA FISHER Softer with them. 

00:32:10
KAY Softer with them. Yes, he's now how he treats me is not how he treat kids. I could like never see him treat his kids the way that he treats me. So, yeah he is definitely soft to the kids. 

00:32:25
JANINA FISHER That's... That's wonderful and... and do you... this was always such an important bottomline, do you feel safe physically with him? 

00:32:35
KAY Yeah. 

00:32:35
JANINA FISHER Or is his violence umm... potentially harmful to you? 

00:32:40
KAY At this point I feel like it's manageable. 

00:32:40
JANINA FISHER But what's manageable? 

00:32:45
KAY Umm... Like I said, we both can get very toxic. So I think that we have like come to the agreement that when space is needed, but that's the best way rather than to be together to try to work it out in the moment. So I think at this point, we kind of come to like a conclusion that, hey, like, just leave, just walk. I'd rather, you walk out or rather like, I leave the situation, rather than keep. 

00:33:10
JANINA FISHER That's a lot of growth for you. 

00:33:10
KAY Yeah. 

00:33:10
JANINA FISHER To be able... 

00:33:15
KAY Oh, yes. 

00:33:15
JANINA FISHER ...to do that. 

00:33:15
KAY Oh, yes, I was not able to do that before. 

00:33:15
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:33:15
KAY And I think maybe that the fact that had kids, I have someone else to come home to that need me, that need the best version of me because I've definitely made mistakes, getting angry and like trying to hold on and involving other people and other things, not... not my children, but like if we're fighting and other people are brought into it, I've made mistakes but I have children that come home too and I can't do that but that's growth. Yes, I do have locked out many times. 

00:33:45
JANINA FISHER Yes. So... So when you are tempted to do something impulsive, it's your kids that... 

00:33:55
KAY That's the only thing. 

00:33:55
JANINA FISHER ...that holds you back. 

00:33:55
KAY I don't. I think that if it wasn't for my kids it would have been very good. 

00:34:00
JANINA FISHER Yeah, so it's... that's wonderful. 

00:34:00
KAY Yes. 

00:34:00
JANINA FISHER So it's almost like your... something inside you said, I have to keep my hand straight. 

00:34:10
KAY Yeah, something a little more serious than anything else. 

00:34:10
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:34:10
KAY Nothing else would start like, the law nothing else would stop me other than my children. 

00:34:20
JANINA FISHER Right, right. When, you know, when you're working with the structural disassociation model as a template in your mind as I do, as a therapist you're listening for the perspective uh... and the language of the normal life part and you're also listening for the language and themes, related to other parts. So, as Kay describes, the way her attached part panics and... and when... when her boyfriend leaves, which is often by the way used manipulatively by batterers, uh... because... because it's a way of getting the: No, don't leave me. Umm... That must be missing in their attachment stories. So... So she describes when he leaves. This little part of her is panicked and beside herself. Umm... What I'm noticing and trying to underscore is each time I hear her pre-frontal cortex speaking when she has some perspective. And... And what she keeps saying in various ways over and over again is once I hack my kids, I had to do it differently. I couldn't let that little part uh... determine my response to my boyfriend because I had kids to think about and I couldn't make them feel... I couldn't let them feel afraid or make their lives crazy. And... And this is a real huge piece of growth for her. It isn't... you know I think sometimes it could be misinterpreted as she's not really dealing with what is because she's talking about how she cares for the kids and... and how she's modified her behavior for their sakes. I hear the voice of the normal life self which is... it also an instinctive response in us, right. As you probably well know that when... when we as therapists take a deep breath and we say, okay, my client is coming, umm... it isn't that it's easy, it's that that there is an instinct that suddenly makes this part of the brain available and able to listen and able to be empathic. Umm... And even able to think uh... which is a wonderful thing. So that's... they are very lucky I think. 

00:37:25
KAY Yes, yes. 

00:37:25
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:37:30
KAY Driving home instead of driving somewhere else to get mad, it's very nice to come home then. Yes, be their mom. 

00:37:40
JANINA FISHER Yes, yes, yes, yes. Just... Just be regular. 

00:37:40
KAY Yes, be regular. 

00:37:45
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 'Cause you... I mean, you haven't... you know that I think, I view somebody who didn't get as much regular in your growing up. 

00:37:55
KAY No. 

00:37:55
JANINA FISHER As... You know, as much as your parents tried. 

00:38:00
KAY Yeah, my parents are very regular. I feel like, you know, they did everything to raise a regular person. But there is a lot that went on to me that probably was internal not based on how they raised me. 

00:38:15
JANINA FISHER Well, and I think the other thing that we just have to... to mention is that, that what is missing in the whole adoption world is education for adoptive parents. 

00:38:30
KAY Yes. 

00:38:35
JANINA FISHER About attachment, about trauma, about what their newly adopted children have been through. 

00:38:40
KAY Yes. 

00:38:40
JANINA FISHER Whether it's three months or three years or... 

00:38:45
KAY However long. 

00:38:45
JANINA FISHER However long it's been. So that the parent who's regular and... 

00:38:50
KAY Can go, yeah. 

00:38:50
JANINA FISHER Gung-ho to raise a child. 

00:38:55
KAY So excited, so happy. 

00:38:55
JANINA FISHER Yeah, umm... is ready for the fact that it's gonna be... it's gonna be rocky. 

00:39:00
KAY Yeah, not saying that my parents but I feel like they learned, now they know but I feel like knowing in the beginning would have been easier rather than maybe too late because that's how it probably felt to them like they learned when I was what 16, 17. 

00:39:15
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:39:15
KAY So in that sense, the choices or the path had kind of been like already going downhill, so maybe it was too late. 

00:39:25
JANINA FISHER Right, right. And... And you know, that's something to... to really feel good about because I know those weren't as easy years for you. 

00:39:35
KAY No, yeah. 

00:39:35
JANINA FISHER That you really did in the end help your parents. 

00:39:40
KAY Oh, yeah. 

00:39:40
JANINA FISHER To be better parents for you. 

00:39:45
KAY Definitely. 

00:39:45
JANINA FISHER And that's... 

00:39:45
KAY They learned a lot. 

00:39:45
JANINA FISHER Before you were part of this. 

00:39:50
KAY Oh, yeah. They've... I think they love me maybe even more, then they would have thought because of all this like... 

00:39:55
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:39:55
KAY You know, I think they do love me more after all this and teaching them all of this that they had no idea. Because of course, they were just excited people, stable in their life already, they love their baby more than I think a lot of parents know how to love. So it's like, they did thing, they did nothing. I mean, they did not do anything textbook wrong, they gave me the best childhood, but they just didn't know. 

00:40:20
JANINA FISHER Right. And... And you didn't do anything wrong because you... you didn't know why these feelings... 

00:40:25
KAY Oh, yeah. 

00:40:30
JANINA FISHER ...and impulses were there. 

00:40:30
KAY Yeah. 

00:40:30
JANINA FISHER And why they were kind of coming out of nowhere. 

00:40:35
KAY Yeah. 

00:40:35
JANINA FISHER And uh... so you understand a lot more now. 

00:40:40
KAY Yeah. Definitely being through all of what I've been through. 

00:40:40
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:40:40
KAY Made me more educate. I... I wouldn't say that it changes everything because I still feel like those attachment issues are still there. 

00:40:50
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:40:50
KAY So it's like and I still can't recognize enough to leave a situation. 

00:41:00
JANINA FISHER So this is actually, I think this is a wonderful thing for us to focus on. Because it's so clear that you want that stable regular safe living environment for your kids. 

00:41:15
KAY Yes. Stable even more them, for me, I want stable. Like kind of like they are going to bed at a certain time like, waking up, you know, weekends, you could go out but like very normal, like let's go out for dinner, let's like bring the kids, let's put them to bed at a certain time, let's... I want something consistent rather than never knowing how it's gonna be... 

00:41:35
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:41:35
KAY ...the next day. 

00:41:35
JANINA FISHER That's right. That's and that's... that's so good for your nervous system. 

00:41:40
KAY Yeah and for my kids. Because like I said my daughter who I feel like it was more moving around that she has trouble sleeping where my son has more of a very like, I had my apartment, like when he was very young, like I moved my parents house to the apartment and so since then, it's been stale. So he's a very different mannered or he, she's more high-strung just because he was moving around when she was young or renting different rooms, moving to different cities. 

00:42:10
JANINA FISHER And probably more much more stress and anxiety. 

00:42:15
KAY Oh, yes. Because there was... first time parents too. So of course, I was 18 when I got pregnant. So I was, I was young too. So I definitely I was still taking care of myself and I had to learn to raise a baby. 

00:42:25
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:42:25
KAY So of course she had... 

00:42:25
UNKNOWN It's a huge thing to learn at any age. 

00:42:30
KAY Yeah. So she, I always feel like I will thank her because I don't think she realize that she like saved my life at a time and like she stood by... I mean, she stood by me but she watched me grow up in a sense like she's two now where I could still see so much of like when I cry, she gets very like... To my emotions I feel like she might be closer to my emotions than my son is. He's so much more calm whereas my daughter, if I cry, you see she will start crying or you know, mamma, mamma, so she's a lot more in tune with my emotions, I feel like because she's witnessed so much more. 

00:43:05
JANINA FISHER And because she's a female child. 

00:43:10
KAY Yes, that's probably it. She's like my... 

00:43:10
JANINA FISHER Boys, the boys have this... 

00:43:15
KAY He is always happy. He'll just look at me and smile all the time, even I would get upset. My daughter will get upset if I'm upset. 

00:43:20
JANINA FISHER Yeah, yeah, yeah and... and how... how did they respond when your boyfriend gets mean or loud or... or does he gets violent in front of the kids? 

00:43:35
KAY No, not like probably scary to them when he but I... I would say that he's kept that at a minimum. I would say honestly that, no my daughter hears a lot too. But they have been so young like my daughter is now two and he... she hasn't really seen anything, I would say which she... she can't remember, she'll never remember what she's heard, but so I don't know. Like I said, if you like just fight... because we fight a lot at night when she's asleep, but she'd wake up and I feel that's why she could... she has severe sleep issues, it's not just like a little. She wakes up all the time still. She has weird patterns. So I feel like, they cry more, but I... he keeps that to a minimum with the children. But they cry because they hear yelling and they... as I said when they are asleep so they would be woken up out of sleep. 

00:44:20
JANINA FISHER Right, right. Yes and... and I... you actually use that as an example when I talk about, when I teach about trauma, umm... and about how children you know, children can't measure umm... abuse or trauma on a scale. 

00:44:45
KAY Yeah. 

00:44:45
JANINA FISHER Oh that was a 50, oh that was a 90. Children feel scared or they don't feel scared. 

00:44:50
KAY Yeah. 

00:44:55
JANINA FISHER And... And parental fighting specially at night I think is very scary for kids often. 

00:45:00
KAY Yeah. I mean, like even... yeah, that's what I'm saying, they don't really know what's going on but they don't like yelling especially. But like loud noises even scare if I drop like a pen or you know, like they are fighting, I feel like there is... so I don't think they know exactly what's going on. They are not like oh, there is abuse going on but they're scared because in dead sleep and they hear a fighting and yelling and... 

00:45:25
JANINA FISHER Right, right and that's... and we've learnt that actually it's the fear that is the... is the cause of... of trauma. 

00:45:35
KAY Yeah. 

00:45:40
JANINA FISHER And uh... so I think it's really good that you're aware. 

00:45:40
KAY Oh, yeah, like I said it kept... I would say like since my son has been born, like I'm saying my daughter was a little more like as learning that hey, number one, it's not okay to wake her up and she's crying but I would say my son, it's happened like twice and I think that was changed very quickly that we don't want that around our kids, so leaving is better. 

00:46:05
JANINA FISHER Right, right. 

00:46:05
KAY So my son has gone more of the calm like, that's why I said my son, having my son born has made not only his life more calmer, my daughter's life because it hasn't happened in two years with her being like around. 

00:46:20
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:46:20
KAY So it's been like hers has decreased a lot. He's been able to be more calm but with her it was (inaudible ) experience with because we'd always say, used to fighting with no babies so it was like only affecting us but it's not fair when kids just are born and they didn't... they didn't sign up to a fight or argue. 

00:46:35
JANINA FISHER Right. That's right. And they certainly didn't raise their hands and volunteer to be scared. 

00:46:40
KAY Exactly. That was... which is not fair to them which is why I think that has matured our relationship because of the kids. 

00:46:50
JANINA FISHER One of the themes that is being expressed, maybe not directly which is why I want to share this with you is the theme of what Dan Siegel calls earned secured attachment. You may be familiar with it. It's the term that's used for adults who despite having had attachment failure or less than optimal attachment in childhood have the same uh... score the same on measures of adult attachment as the childhood secured attachment clients. And it's... it's really a wonderful thing because if you test a group of individuals who have secured attachment as a result of parents capable of facilitating secured attachment and you test those who by virtue of their work in therapy, healthy relationships made in adulthood, often the raising of children, the vicarious attachment figure uh... vicarious attachment experience of providing for your children what you didn't have as a child. All of those can contribute to developing earned secured attachment status. You put the two groups together uh... give them the adult attachment inventory and they look remarkably alike. There is... There is no statistical uh... difference between them. So this earning of secured attachment is something that, that Kay is starting to feel through her ability to mother her children. You know, it's really, you have to agree that it's remarkable thing. She was 18 when her first was born. Uh...Sshe spent a lot of her pregnancy on the run because her parents forbade her boyfriend to live with her in their house. So he and she were on the run for many, many months, very unstable time in her life. But as soon as her daughter was born, her maternal instincts were right there. And... And so what she's describing is the way that she is stabilizing as a result of the attachment she's provided for her children. You can certainly hear moments where or you can hear attachment is a little anxious, a little umm... maybe a little preoccupied, understandable in a mother who has trauma history but by and large umm... she's giving her children umm... as normal and experience as she can provide. So this earned secured attachment uh... again is... is part of what I'm writing about in my book. I'm going to start trying out with her working with her parts in a way that promotes earned secured attachment and let's see what happens. You know what I'm really struck by is how... how much you, you know, your focus on the kids has changed you. 

00:50:45
KAY Oh, yeah. 

00:50:45
JANINA FISHER And umm... and like stabilized your reactions. 

00:50:50
KAY Yes. 

00:50:50
JANINA FISHER So much more. 

00:50:50
KAY Yeah. I mean, it had to. I became a mom, I don't know why, maybe it was internally that me being a mom, I definitely... like when I got pregnant, adoption was brought up by my parents, like, hey, have you thought about it? Obviously people had asked me like, (inaudible ), but like I feel like, after being adopted not that I'm not thank for I was adopted but either being adopted, I couldn't give up my kids for adopt. I rather have gone through and become a better woman and girl just because of what I've been through. 

00:51:25
JANINA FISHER Absolutely. 

00:51:25
KAY Through adoption, I just couldn't do it again. Not that I don't believe in it but it wasn't, so you know I could ever emotionally have handled giving up a child, I don't know, that's because I was adopted but. 

00:51:35
JANINA FISHER Right, it would... it would have just... 

00:51:40
KAY It would have killed, I think it would have killed me. 

00:51:40
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:51:40
KAY I don't think I would be able to be seeing if I had given... 

00:51:45
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:51:45
KAY ...them up. Which is... 

00:51:50
JANINA FISHER Yeah. I... I mean it makes, it makes sense. 

00:51:50
KAY Yeah. 

00:51:50
JANINA FISHER Because especially when... I mean I think people sort of get it but maybe not totally that, that to give up a baby that you've carried for nine months is a huge separation. 

00:52:05
KAY Oh, yeah, my birth mom, I don't think has ever could ever do anything. 21 years later and she... I don't think she's... I don't think she's ever gonna come back from it. I mean, she has had other kids since but I don't think that ever filled the void of being 17 and giving birth up a child. 

00:52:25
JANINA FISHER Right, right, right. And... And... And ironically might have made it harder for her to stabilize, (inaudible ) the kids she had. 

00:52:36
KAY Oh, yeah, she was unable to be probably the mom then maybe she could have been if there wasn't for what happened. 

00:52:40
JANINA FISHER Right. 

00:52:40
KAY That's hard to see but. 

00:52:45
JANINA FISHER Yeah. You know, I'm wondering because I'm... I'm thinking about how the, you know, how you're boyfriend had kind of... how did the glue that holds this family together but also umm... in a way it's so different from who you're becoming. 

00:53:10
KAY Yes. 

00:53:15
JANINA FISHER Right and I think that wasn't so true when you met, I mean he was older and he'd been through a lot more. 

00:53:20
KAY Yeah. He has another kid, so. Yeah, but that like, not that it... it didn't work out, that's still his daughter but they don't have custody, so it's like, it's in the family that at the grandparents but I think that he definitely is affected differently sometimes. 

00:53:40
JANINA FISHER Right, right. 

00:53:40
KAY So I had to mature, maybe he's still not matured. He has a harder time admitting that he attaches to something because I don't think he ever wants to hold on too tight because I think maybe it scares him. Not that he's not attached to the children but there is definitely a disconnect that he keeps a distance at. Where I like given myself completely to being a mom and giving up who I am or like, and my kids come first. I think that that's more or like putting all his love in a one thing, it's scary for him because I think he was let down. So it's a very different thing. Where I put every... all my eggs in a basket and him and my children. And I feel like he's more like reserved or shut down in the sense of... 

00:54:25
JANINA FISHER Just more... 

00:54:25
KAY ...just letting be loved, I think he struggles being loved like no, I'm not gonna leave, so I think he keeps everything. 

00:54:35
JANINA FISHER Right, so there is a... there is a way that his... his attachment strategy, his survival strategy... 

00:54:45
KAY Yes. 

00:54:45
JANINA FISHER ...is very umm... self-protective. And... And you know it's... it's so interesting, obviously I love this stuff. Umm... Because they see... when they study children, you know, they study in attachment research, they study children from three months of age up until people are in their thirties. So these studies go on forever. 

00:55:15
KAY Yeah. 

00:55:15
JANINA FISHER And uh... and they found that, that his attachments style starts by three, four, five years old. They can see... that's more common in boys than in girls, umm... where... where the... the child, I want to say the little boy, but I'll say the child umm... starts to push the mother away umm... and sort of demand her attention rather than cry for her attention. 

00:55:55
KAY Yeah, their relationship, she loves him more than anything and I know that he loves her more than anything but I... their relationship is very, he is like I felt like he's not... he hasn't been nice to his mom for... not that he's not nice but he's very more like push away but wants her to like do things for him. It's a very different relationship than I have with my mom. Like he, I don't know, he will miss birthdays, he'll miss Mother's Day, all those kinds of things, not that he doesn't love his mom because I know how important his mom is to him and he'll say, how important, but there is still very, they've had a lot of struggle because you know, they divorced, his adoptive parents. They adopted and divorced when he was four. So I don't know if that was another effect but then... 

00:56:40
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

00:56:40
KAY It's so weird to see him with his mom, it is weird like, you know, it's her birthday, you should call, and they do see each other but when it comes to like important things about it being about her, he's very different about it. Like I don't need to call her, I don't... I don't know, they have a weird relationship which I feel like... 

00:57:00
JANINA FISHER At least, he umm... you know that what they call that style in children is umm... let me see, if I can remember it. Controlling punitive, I think. Is that right? Umm... No, there is another word for it. It's basically, controlling through aggression as opposed to kids who... who umm... try to stay close by, by care taking the parent or as stand(ph) for care. 

00:57:30
KAY Yeah, that not him. That's not hum. 

00:57:35
JANINA FISHER So... So let me ask you a kind of weird question. 

00:57:35
KAY Hmm-hmm. 

00:57:40
JENINA FISHER Because I know you as much as you feel this tremendous bond with him. You also have mixed feelings. 

00:57:50
KAY Oh, yeah. 

00:57:50
JANINA FISHER About this relationship. 

00:57:50
KAY A 100%. 

00:57:55
JANINA FISHER Yeah. And uh... and that's a very confusing combination to feel so bonded but also... 

00:58:00
KAY I can't imagine my life without him but then at the same time, I couldn't see myself being with somebody else if that makes sense. 

00:58:10
JANINA FISHER And uh... 

00:58:10
KAY But I don't. 

00:58:15
JANINA FISHER And could you ima... so you can't... could you imagine being with him. 

00:58:20
KAY Yeah, that's what I was gonna say, I was like, I didn't say that right. I mean, I don't know if I could spend the next 80, 70, 80 years. Like when I think about how a relationship should be, our relationship is not I think normal. So it's like, I don't know if I could spend the rest of my life with him but it's like, I feel like, I would just stay with him forever. 

00:58:45
JANINA FISHER Right because... because of what happens... 

00:58:50
KAY When he leaves, when he leaves. 

00:58:50
JANINA FISHER When he leaves and have you ever asked him to leave? 

00:58:55
KAY Yes, this is the most recent one where I did kick him out for the last... I think it was three weeks which is the longest for me. Like I packed up all his stuff, didn't talk to him but so then I... I felt... 

00:59:10
JANINA FISHER And then what was that like for you? 

00:59:10
KAY At that point, what he had done to me, at that point, I felt really good. For that moment, I feel like circumstances made it feel good because I wasn't alone necessarily. When there is a lot of dishonesty in our relationship and I think that for him it happened years where he would cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat. I mean, our whole relationship which is why I ended up kicking him out but like towards probably like when we have been dating, two-and-a-half, three years, I have met someone that was not on a sexual level but a very, I felt like he was there on my, when my boyfriend was not there. So at the time that he... 

00:59:50
JANINA FISHER So he was there more emotionally. 

00:59:55
KAY Emotionally, not that we would hung out every day but like when we did, I felt good which my significant other could not make me feel at that point and my... So the last time he kicked me out, he had sent a picture of a girl in my bed and let me put out, a little situation down. I pay rent, he does not care take me. I pay rent, I pay for the kids, I put food on the table, I am the caretaker of the relationship. So that this... 

01:00:20
JANINA FISHER Does he contribute at all? 

01:00:20
KAY No, not right now. Maybe he'd... no, he's not a... he's very... 

01:00:25
JANINA FISHER I mean, has he ever helped to pay for the kids or for you? 

01:00:35
KAY I remember maybe three months that he helped with rent when I was pregnant and he was an , (inaudible ) and I ended up, I've been at work 50 hours when I was pregnant and I've been hospitalized multiple times with my pregnancy because I could not umm... eat umm... not purposely, I was super sick and was losing weight like seven pounds in three days. 

01:00:55
JENINA FISHER Wow! 

01:00:55
KAY So I had to be like put on IVs. So I was very ill. So, me working 50 hours, just about... 

01:01:00
JENINA FISHER Was not healthy. 

01:01:00
KAY ...killed me. I was skinnier than I've ever been when I was pregnant with my daughter. I was a stick with the belly, a belly like because I was so sick. So like I'm saying, I had to very woman up, man up at that point. So when he had sent me this picture about a month back of a girl in my bed with that my children live at, that I pay for, it was an extreme disrespect but at that moment that he had sent that, we had not really been getting along umm... and I'd been with the other person like I said not sexually because we had not brought it to that point but we were together, when he had sent that picture. So at that moment, it made it really easy to leave him because I had felt like maybe I had some connection or some, something in a person that made me feel good that okay, I'm gonna end this with him and the other person is still gonna be my... be in my life, have a relationship. 

01:01:55
JANINA FISHER So... So really the fear, the deep down dark fear... 

01:01:55
KAY I wasn't alone. 

01:02:00
JANINA FISHER ...is that fear of being alone. 

01:02:00
KAY I wasn't. And... And then what happened is the person that I had this relationship with for so long had ended things a day after I had... yeah, so I felt like, it was a lot and so in that moment, I felt like I could have asked my boyfriend to come back, but I was still like, okay, I'm gonna be okay and then give it two weeks of being a normal... 

01:02:20
JANINA FISHER And... And... And... And was that in part because you had the kids? So in fact, you would be okay because when the kids are there, you have to be lonely? 

01:02:30
KAY Like, I had to, of course, I like, the kids, I had to be okay for the kids. If it wasn't, I would probably go back into old behaviors of not wanting to live. So when two of those ended, I had to focus on being a mom. 

01:02:45
JANINA FISHER Wow, that was huge. 

01:02:45
KAY That was huge. 

01:02:45
JANINA FISHER And it did not... it didn't knock you down. 

01:02:50
KAY Not for once. And like, it was difficult, I cried, I... but at that point, I was able to let... 

01:02:55
JANINA FISHER Which is normal. 

01:02:55
KAY Yes. Definitely very sad because it was like two things in one because I didn't even cry when he had sent that picture because at that point, I'd gone through so much. 

01:03:05
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:03:05
KAY So you know, I don't want to be alone in my apartment with my kids, so I ended up staying with my parents and my parents also in my room with the kids. So that helped and then I was able to be friends with people that I probably cut off because that's part of... I've also a lot of friends, I wasn't really allowed to go out. So, I like, you know, I was able to... I put the kids, this was our old routine, I put the kids down to sleep and about 9:30, I'll go grab dinner with some of the girls I work with. Because that's when my mom, it's easy for my mom to baby-sit when the kids are asleep. So that was nice. So I was able to go out. But give that two weeks of doing that, I started feeling very in some sense alone not that my kids didn't make me feel, but I feel like it's the when your kids are asleep, I felt alone in a different sense. Like I felt like the person I'm supposed to be with the kids... 

01:03:55
JANINA FISHER Kay has just described for us uh... something extraordinary that she has not been able to do since she met her boyfriend and I believe around age 15, 16. She was able to kick him out to say, no, you cannot treat me this way and to not feel alone because she had her kids, and to pull on the resources of her normal life part. I went out with my girlfriends, I had a good time and... and I didn't feel that terrible scared alone feeling. And... And although she wasn't able to sustain it umm... because this is... this is her growing edge. Nonetheless, it's very, very, very important. She's internalizing the... the proximity, the attachment to her children in such a way that it's providing a resource, internally for that attached part. And we have proved that that when I talk about the attached part or the cry for help part or the fight part, you know, my understanding from a brain point of view about what a part is, each part is connected to certain brain structures, certain neural networks and also hold what we call implicit or non-verbal memories. So clearly the... the cry for help or attached part holds the non-verbal memories of abandonment panic, of running after the contact seeking, what we call pursuing in couples therapy. Uh... Just as the fight part holds both the implicit instinctual responses, back off, my... you can't do that to me umm... and implicit memories of not being able to trust people, not being able to umm... to have control. So... umm... so this was... this was really a milestone for her and I hope her therapist uh... will build on it with her. I was able to kick him out and I didn't feel that terrible alone feeling. So what I want to now do in the remaining minutes of this session is that I want to help her internalize the felt connection and the... and really connect her maternal sense to this little part of her who we can think of as the baby part, as the baby... the abandoned baby. And uh... and see if we can mobilize strength. She already has inside on behalf of this little part. And I'm going to use what I jokingly refer to as my co-therapist, I can't remember if I joke, if I said this to her. Uh... This was brought in to me by a client years ago uh... who said you know, I was walking around a toy store and I saw this upon a shelf and I knew this is what you've been talking about. You've been talking about how we need to hold our little selves in our pouches. We have to keep them in our pouches so they feel safe now. So, this has been my... my way of explaining attachment, internal attachment to my clients. Because if I just talk about it as an intellectual con... construct, you know, they will say, well that sounds good. Umm... But it's not going to have a... a felt meaning to them. When as... as I do with Kay, when I say, well, no wonder, look she's out here all by herself and... and it's scary for a little tiny girl or I could say for a baby. And... And so and I can see her face start to melt when she sees this... this little one. You can see... You can see that maternal part of her uh... immediately, it's right there. So let's... let's go on and uh... and see if we can get a little earned secured attachment going with the help of the kangaroos. You know, there is a lot to be said for... for using visual images umm... for using symbolic umm... you know, actual, not just symbolic thinking because that's intellectual, but... but symbols that draw the right brain's attention, not just the left brain's. So... So did you start to get the alone feeling in those few hours between the kids going to school? 

01:10:00
KAY With my friends I felt lonely. When I am with other people or even other man, it makes me feel more lonely that the only person that I want to be with is... So I don't even know how to explain it. 

01:10:15
JANINA FISHER But you know, it's interesting how can you tell that you want to be with your boyfriend? 

01:10:25
KAY I don't... it's in everything I do. I don't even know, I can't imagine. 

01:10:25
JANINA FISHER I mean, like when you say I want to be with him... 

01:10:35
KAY Hmm-hmm. 

01:10:35
JANINA FISHER ...what... what feelings do you notice? 

01:10:45
KAY I feel like happiness isn't even the right word because it doesn't really make me feel "happy" but maybe just not so alone. So I don't know I feel, I feel like I just need it. 

01:10:55
JANINA FISHER Uh-huh, okay so there is, it's almost like you need to want to be near him. 

01:11:00
KAY Yes, like a lot of people they describe it like a drug. Like I'm very addicted to our relationship whereas like I just can't imagine, like I say I need it, like as if a person needed heroine, I need it like... 

01:11:20
JANINA FISHER Right and... and so part of what you're saying is that even saying I want to be with him helps the lonely feeling. 

01:11:30
KAY Yes. Or, yeah. 

01:11:30
JANINA FISHER And umm... and... and then when you're with him, the lonely feeling is gone and what feeling is there instead? 

01:11:45
KAY I want to say complete but it's never complete. I don't know, I would say feel just as alone sometimes when I'm with him. 

01:11:50
JANINA FISHER Right, right. So that's the dilemma. And then when he's with you and you feel more alone. Umm... What happens next? 

01:12:05
KAY I get sad. I get scared. I'm always scared to lose him. 

01:12:10
JANINA FISHER And how does he... And how does he do when you're scared? 

01:12:10
KAY He doesn't like it. I can't have any feelings or really emotions. He doesn't like any of that. I don't... he's very like... I... he doesn't... he doesn't like it. I feel like he's very hard time... 

01:12:25
JANINA FISHER So does he get angry, does he get... 

01:12:25
KAY He gets angry and he just leaves like all I can describe our relationship is me waking up to see the kids when they need their bottle and never knowing if because we don't always sleep together because I sleep with the kids. I'm very like coarsely cover everything. So he'll sleep on a mattress outside, not because we don't have a good thing, but sometimes the kids, he just wants to smooch them or whatever that is but I remember making a bottle and like never knowing if he was gonna still be staying or sleeping. So I don't know maybe his reaction is to just leave when things are getting tough but... 

01:13:00
JANINA FISHER Right, so... so he... 

01:13:05
KAY Distances himself maybe. 

01:13:05
JANINA FISHER Right, probably because it triggers him. 

01:13:05
KAY Yes. 

01:13:10
JANINA FISHER And uh... and he can't say that triggers me. 

01:13:10
KAY No. 

01:13:10
JANINA FISHER So then you have a lot of emotion, he can't deal and then what happens to all your emotions? 

01:13:20
KAY I get very stressed. I get very anx... I don't know, I'm like, I just freak out. I mean, I can't freak out like I used to because I have children. My... Before I had kids, I would chase after him. I would spend hours and hours driving, finding him, going crazy. 

01:13:40
JANINA FISHER Hmm-hmm. Right. 

01:13:40
KAY Drive a 100 miles per hour, fight anyone, any girl that I found, fight her anything to get him back to do anything. That was before I had kids, not saying, I don't feel those impulses, but I have to still be, but those are how I feel. 

01:13:55
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:13:55
KAY Like, I need to go chase him, I need to go find him, I need to drag him back, I need anything, not actually drag him, but that's how I feel... 

01:14:00
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:14:05
KAY ...take him back home. 

01:14:05
JANINA FISHER Right, so you... you feel that life or death. 

01:14:10
KAY Yes. That is how I am. 

01:14:10
JANINA FISHER I've got to find him. 

01:14:10
KAY Yes, I've spent hours. Like finding him in bushes, I mean like I've found him five hours away. 

01:14:20
JANINA FISHER And it's clearly not a rational thought. 

01:14:20
KAY No. 

01:14:20
JANINA FISHER It's an... It's an impulse, it's coming from your body. 

01:14:25
KAY Yeah, I don't like to drive a 120 miles on the free way. But that's... But at that moment, nothing else matters. Like, oh cops gonna play, okay, who cares? 

01:14:35
JANINA FISHER Yeah, right. And... 

01:14:35
KAY It's weird. I get and a diff... a different Kylie that nobody else sees. And me like I work, oh, you're so calm, and it's like, okay, you don't know well how it goes. 

01:14:50
JANINA FISHER Right, so really what you're describing is the... and it's confusing but you're describing the panic of a baby whose, whose attachment figure has just said, I'm out of here. 

01:15:10
KAY Yeah. 

01:15:15
JANINA FISHER Umm... I remember, I worked with a young woman whose... whose mother used to just do the same thing and just leave her alone. 

01:15:20
KAY That's... 

01:15:25
JANINA FISHER The mother would just say, I've had it, I can't take this, get in the car, drive away. And I remember my client had this memory from when she was seven of running after her mom's car saying, stop, stop, right. It's that kind of panic. 

01:15:45
KAY Yeah, I remember my birth mom was honest with me in that. That happened two hours not seven by any means but I was three months old and crying, and she would just... I mean, she didn't say, to be mean but she's... she did not help, she just left when I was in the room and she's been honest and told me. So I was lucky enough for honesty to know that okay that... that might viable, you know, she's told me because she just had to leave. 

01:16:10
JANINA FISHER Right. And so you know what happens to a three month old. 

01:16:10
KAY Oh yeah, just scream. 

01:16:15
JANINA FISHER Who's crying for her mother and her mother leaves. 

01:16:20
KAY Yeah. 

01:16:20
JANINA FISHER And so that... that memory is still in your body. And... And now there is this... this new, it's like... it's like your... your because it's the medial pre-frontal cortex, it's like your... your medial pre-frontal cortex has come into the picture and says, but the kids. 

01:16:45
KAY Yeah, that is though, that is the thing that's like, I've had to learn to. Still... I still struggle but the kids are asleep and I usually end up not sleeping if he'll... he'll leave but you know, I will, I don't know, it's still difficult, it's not the kids don't fix that little part of me. Like I have to watch a TV show or do something different. But I still have the emotions, I want to chase after him. 

01:17:10
JANINA FISHER You feel the impulses. 

01:17:10
KAY That's how I would still describe it... describe it. 

01:17:10
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:17:10
KAY Or you know, what I do now is very weird, but I will call him probably in 20, 30 minutes, like I will probably call him 340 times, no matter if he picks up or not. So may that's the different way of... I mean, I actually having to leave but I could probably call a 1,000 times in a day like literally until his phone is like dead because that's like my other way of... I'm not actually physically leaving but I'm trying to contact all night long. 

01:17:40
JANINA FISHER Right. So... So it's like, it's... it's the way, the only thing you can let your little self do. 

01:17:50
KAY Yes, it's called so attacks so many times. 

01:17:55
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:17:55
KAY And it seems so... I mean, people are like, oh, like I called him seven times, I'm like, I could do a 100 calls in 20 minutes, like I can't stop. 

01:18:05
JANINA FISHER And... And as you're, as you're calling over and over and over again, do you feel better or do you feel worse? 

01:18:15
KAY Just as anxious. I wouldn't say, may seem feel better or worse. I'm just, it's a very severe high-strung. Maybe it does make me feel better calling. I don't like not doing. I cannot put my phone, my finger on the call button. 

01:18:25
JANINA FISHER So it's almost like you're possessed. 

01:18:30
KAY Yes. 

01:18:30
JANINA FISHER By this impulse. 

01:18:35
KAY Yes. Like I will not get off from my phone. 

01:18:35
JANINA FISHER Because it isn't... it isn't... it doesn't sound like you're saying, what's the best thing to do in this situation? 

01:18:40
KAY No. 

01:18:45
JANINA FISHER It's... That it's coming as purely a gut. 

01:18:45
KAY That I have to do it. 

01:18:50
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

01:18:50
KAY Even when he doesn't pick up for three days, I will have called him millions of times, it feels like and I don't even exaggerate. I mean, I will call him 24/7 like I will wake myself up at two in the morning to call his phone. 

01:19:05
JANINA FISHER And here is... here is the dilemma that I see. I mean, I see two dilemmas. One dilemma is that it... it's... it's a little... it's a little bit like training him how to get you to prove you love him. 

01:19:25
KAY Yeah. 

01:19:30
JANINA FISHER But thus how could he not feel... 

01:19:30
KAY Oh yeah, it sounds like it's really weird like sometimes I or someone would call me a million times, so I know that person loves me but in that situation like that's not his position in our relationship. He's never gonna be the one to call me a million times. 

01:19:45
JANINA FISHER And again not because he doesn't love you. 

01:19:50
KAY Oh yeah. 

01:19:50
JANINA FISHER But because that's not his attachment style. 

01:19:50
KAY Yeah, like this time that I kicked him out, I was definitely more of a strong Kylie that I'm guessing as why people, I don't think people know that we're back together again. I'm guessing that it's about to hit the light. But I think people thought that it was gonna happen this time because I did it, but he... he begged to come back. So at this point where he was actually thinking that I was gonna leave or move on or like someone else that's when I... he's finally like, I saw a very different like do not leave. 

01:20:25
JANINA FISHER So... So pause for a moment and imagine because the, you know, the... the well worn path is the path that circles back to him, it's like the two... the two of you have this circular... 

01:20:40
KAY Oh yes. It never ends. 

01:20:40
JANINA FISHER And then there is this other path that you kind of sort of started to go down. 

01:20:50
KAY Yes. 

01:20:50
JANINA FISHER And then so the pull of the familiar path. 

01:20:55
KAY Yes. Definitely, it's a fit, I like the familiar like, I don't... I feel comfortable in a sense where I feel like I can never feel with someone... someone else, that's why I like... like I'm saying, I would go out with people but it was like, I just wanted to crawl back in that what I know. 

01:21:10
JANINA FISHER right. 

01:21:10
KAY Like I just feel connected to them in many ways that I don't think like in other ways, I just of who I... like it's simple as, oh, I don't wear make up in front of him but I feel like I have to be so... just comfortable the routine, that confusion. But I definitely feel like a path was kind of made a little bit. 

01:21:30
JANINA FISHER And... And... And it's... it's really like... here I am... I just have to got a... I think I got a prop here. This is... This is my co-therapist. You know, I think what you're describing is a path that was carved out by... by your little self. And umm... you know, it's funny how... how, you know, our little selves can kind of take our big selves umm... on all kinds of crazy paths. 

01:22:10
KAY Yes. 

01:22:15
JANINA FISHER As opposed to like what you've done with your kids and you've said no more crazy paths. 

01:22:20
KAY Yeah, that's what... 

01:22:20
JANINA FISHER We're gonna live in one place. 

01:22:20
KAY Yes. 

01:22:25
JANINA FISHER It's gonna be regular. They're gonna have bedtime. 

01:22:25
KAY Dinners. 

01:22:25
JANINA FISHER Dinners. 

01:22:25
KAY Everything is just normal. 

01:22:30
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:22:30
KAY I try to make it normal for them because I don't want them to do what I do either. Like I don't ever want them to feel like I wasn't there because obviously I don't want them to be like how I'm over a guy that doesn't even treat them that great. 

01:22:40
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:22:45
KAY I never want my daughter to do that. I never want my son to be the person. 

01:22:50
JANINA FISHER Who treated... 

01:22:50
KAY No, yeah, no way. So I really have to like make their life different than how I feel. 

01:22:55
JANINA FISHER Right, right. So just imagine that the... the little kangaroo would... stands for both your little self and you know, whose... whose 17-year-old mom couldn't deal with the baby crying. And uh... which you can understand I'm sure, was very hard for you. 

01:23:25
KAY Again with... 

01:23:25
JANINA FISHER Dealing with a newborn baby. 

01:23:30
KAY Oh, yeah. But I was definitely weird. Like when my kids cried, I think people didn't know which way it would go. 

01:23:35
JANINA FISHER Right. I remember talking to your therapist about it. 

01:23:35
KAY Yeah. 

01:23:35
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

01:23:35
KAY Which is weird like I... it did affect me but in senses I don't let my kids cry. I can't hear them my kids cry. Like not that I want... I need to pick them up, I need to make them stop crying. Not that I like want to leave when they cry. Now, it's like, I'm when people say, you need to let them cry a little bit, no way. Like you know, we were crib training and my mom had to crib train because I, would just let her stay until she fall asleep because I didn't want to do it, not... not necessarily, that I want to leave here, the, why do we need to crib train like why we let her cry in her crib? I did not, I could not handle that. 

01:24:15
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:24:15
KAY I just want to make her stop crying and give her what she wanted and let that... that is where the routine is hard because I don't want to... I could never put my... my... my daughter is now in a crib because my mom helped me crib train her. But where my son work because my mom can't do as... we don't have that option anymore. So I've just never crib train my son. 

01:24:40
JANINA FISHER Hmm-hmm. 

01:24:40
KAY I can't do that. I can never imagine putting my son in a crib and listening to him cry. I don't know what it is, I can't. People are like, oh try. 

01:24:50
JANINA FISHER That's the same thing, it's kind of like the other side of not being able to stay in the same room and hear the people cry. 

01:24:55
KAY Yeah, I think that's what it is. It's that... 

01:25:00
JANINA FISHER It's... It's that, you know, when you have these baby attachment memories in your body, it just, it's too agonizing. 

01:25:10
KAY Yes, I'll cry, I'll scream if they are crying and but like I said, I do it differently. I will just, okay, well let's get up now. 

01:25:15
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:25:20
KAY Or then I sleep with them because, yeah it is very hard for me to hear them, I'll cry, I'll be sad, I'll be scared, I'll be... 

01:25:25
JANINA FISHER So that's your little self. 

01:25:25
KAY Yeah. 

01:25:30
JANINA FISHER So, you know, I think and I... and you probably have felt the difference between like the moms, okay got to pick her up, you know, I can't just let her cry. 

01:25:40
KAY Yeah. 

01:25:40
JANINA FISHER And the baby is, pick her up, right. 

01:25:45
KAY Yes. Yeah. Yeah, it's different. 

01:25:50
JANINA FISHER Yeah. So you know, what I want to suggest, you know the reason I have this kangaroo here in my office is to kind of... it's really a symbol umm... that if we take care of our little selves, we will be the best people we're capable of being. Because when we take care of our little selves, we're... we're not afraid and we're not you know, insecure and we can make hard choices like allowing your mom to crib train your daughter. Must have been a very hard choice. 

01:26:30
KAY Yes, it's downstairs and I have the TV on because it would just kill me to hear her cry. It would just... I just didn't understand why then you know, because like, I was worried, she was scared, no one was gonna come back for her. I mean, like my mom would be right outside the door because none of us would do that but I would just like, no, I can't let her feel that we're not gonna come. Like you can only imagine what she fell in the crib like crying. 

01:27:00
JANINA FISHER Hmm-hmm. But here is the thing. What... What's happening and this is so great that you're a mom. What's been happening is your... your little self is being left to cry and it's being left to run after your boyfriend or call him a 100 times umm... because you know, probably for reasons that just had to do with... with not your mom not understanding what was happening and you not understanding, how could you understand at three. 

01:27:40
KAY Yeah. 

01:27:40
JANINA FISHER Umm... The it's like your little self got control of the attachment department. 

01:27:50
KAY Yeah, yes. 

01:27:50
JANINA FISHER You know like, I can see you're in charge of the going to school, going to my job, you know, making the thinking decisions about the kids. 

01:28:00
KAY Yes. 

01:28:05
JANINA FISHER But she is in charge of your emotional and attachment life. 

01:28:10
KAY Yes, definitely, one part of my life is super mature. People would be like, oh, my gosh like, a lot of young moms in my town don't do such a good job and people always like, how... like wow, you work, you have your own apartment, you pay rent, you... that part people are like look up to me like, wow you gave the young mom a good name. 

01:28:30
JANINA FISHER Right. Absolutely. And doesn't she look like she would give a young mom a good name? 

01:28:35
KAY Yes, yes, yes. 

01:28:40
JANINA FISHER Right. But and compared to how much this little one. 

01:28:45
KAY They are still about, yes. 

01:28:45
JANINA FISHER Right, back in the day, you know, you've really kind of taken her in hand more. 

01:28:55
KAY Yes. 

01:28:55
JANINA FISHER But the one place that's hard and it's hard for everybody is when she's hurt, when she feels alone. 

01:29:05
KAY Yeah. 

01:29:05
JANINA FISHER When she feels scared, she is gonna be alone. That's when she needs you to take her under your wing and that's when she needs you to reassure her. And... And you know, it's... it's so funny because I think all of us were taught, you know, people who talk to themselves are crazy but actually the more we talk to ourselves... 

01:29:35
KAY I do that sometimes. 

01:29:35
JANINA FISHER You know. 

01:29:35
KAY I'm okay, Kylie is okay. 

01:29:35
JANINA FISHER Yeah, yeah. 

01:29:40
KAY Like when it super stressful. 

01:29:40
JANINA FISHER Yeah. And I would actually say you're okay, little one. You know, I'd really... you know, I've... I've worked with your child parts for a long time and one of the things that's amazing is I watch grownups like you that can say, you know, it's okay Kylie, it's okay. Okay great, I still want to call him. 

01:30:10
KAY Yeah, yeah. 

01:30:10
JANINA FISHER And then when they say to the little part, when they say, you're okay, I'm here with you, I've got you. It's like a totally different experience. And you know, and you should probably feel, hold... hold the two of them because actually when I hold the little one, I can feel like, you know, I kind of being protective of her. 

01:30:35
KAY Yeah. 

01:30:35
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:30:35
KAY She's so little. 

01:30:35
JANINA FISHER She's so little. Yeah. And that... that's the little one that's afraid to be alone. 

01:30:45
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

01:30:45
JANINA FISHER Right because that grown up Kylie is... has kind of taken on being an adult completely shocked all the people that have said, oh my gosh, she's not gonna be able to do it. 

01:31:00
KAY Yeah. Yes. 

01:31:00
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:31:00
KAY Yeah. 

01:31:05
JANINA FISHER Umm... That's, you know, that's who you are. 

01:31:05
KAY Oh yeah, this is who my children have. 

01:31:10
JANINA FISHER That's right. 

01:31:10
KAY My children don't have this part of me. 

01:31:15
JANINA FISHER Right. And so that little part leads the big part too. 

01:31:20
KAY Yeah. 

01:31:20
JANINA FISHER Yeah. And if you think every time you feel that, oh my God, I'm alone feeling, you... you think of it that's her way of... she's crying and you take her, you know, in your arms, you hold her umm... you know, get a kangaroo. 

01:31:45
KAY Yeah, yes. Definitely. Like... Like this little set. 

01:31:45
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

01:31:45
KAY It's a nice one. 

01:31:50
JANINA FISHER Yeah, yeah. So we get to stop momentarily, but I can really feel that, you know, remember when we talked, where was it, four or five years ago, I really felt that you... you got it, but it really took your kids to get it at... at deep, deep level. 

01:32:15
KAY Yes. 

01:32:15
JANINA FISHER Kind of like get it in your guts. 

01:32:15
KAY Yes. 

01:32:15
JANINA FISHER And uh... and I really have that same feeling if you get. You get this little one. 

01:32:25
KAY Yeah. 

01:32:25
JANINA FISHER You know, totally. 

01:32:25
KAY Yes, definitely. 

01:32:25
JANINA FISHER Yeah. And... And if you... you know, it's... it's a really is carving out a whole new path and.. and we don't know where it will go. 

01:32:35
KAY Yes. 

01:32:40
JANINA FISHER Umm... This crazy, you know... you know, what do they call them, you know, roller derby... 

01:32:45
KAY Yes. 

01:32:50
JANINA FISHER ...crash car thing is uh... is very familiar but I think it doesn't... it hasn't made her feel safe. 

01:33:00
KAY No. And I'm hoping that even though I create a little path and I'm probably... I don't know when it will end, I can't say oh, it's gonna end tomorrow, because that would probably be the line. But I think as I started the path, it won't be easier to go back on it at some point. 

01:33:15
JANINA FISHER Yeah. And you think... you could start to think, okay what's my bottom-line from... for that little one. 

01:33:25
KAY Yeah. 

01:33:25
JANINA FISHER You know, there is one thing to be a grown up and say, well, you know, I can take it, I can do it umm... but... but what's her bottom-line, like what does she lead you. It's just like with your daughter. 

01:33:40
KAY Consistency. 

01:33:45
JANINA FISHER If your boyfriend laid a hand on your daughter, I don't imagine. 

01:33:50
KAY Oh, would not end well. 

01:33:50
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:33:50
KAY It would not end well for him. 

01:33:50
JANINA FISHER Right, right, this other path would be a (inaudible ). 

01:33:56
KAY Yes, yes, definitely. 

01:33:56
JANINA FISHER Right. And so... so I think the more... you know, I wouldn't even worry about what to do about your boyfriend. I would just concentrate on making her feel as secure as your kids feel. 

01:34:15
KAY Okay. 

01:34:15
JANINA FISHER You know, like your kids would never feel all alone in the world. 

01:34:20
KAY No. 

01:34:20
JANINA FISHER Right. 

01:34:20
KAY Definitely not. 

01:34:20
JANINA FISHER And she shouldn't have to feel all alone in the world. 

01:34:25
KAY That's good. I like that. 

01:34:25
JANINA FISHER Yeah, yeah. I like that too. It feels, it... it can feels like it's... it... it gets you out of the what to do about him and then, it's kind of brings you back to you. 

01:34:40
KAY Yes, yes. 

01:34:40
JANINA FISHER Yeah. 

01:34:40
KAY (inaudible ) like to go about handling it. 

01:34:45
JANINA FISHER Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you'll... you'll see just like your daughter tought you so much, I bet this little one will teach you something. 

01:34:55
KAY Yeah, in time it will probably help with the other situation when I take care of her. 

01:35:00
JANINA FISHER Right, right. Absolutely. Cool. Well, I'm so glad you came. Thank you for doing it. 

01:35:05
KAY I really enjoyed it. 

01:35:05
JANINA FISHER Good.
