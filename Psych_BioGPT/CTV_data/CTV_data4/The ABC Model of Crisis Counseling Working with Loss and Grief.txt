KRISTI KANEL Hello, I'm Dr. Kristi Kanel, Professor of Human Services at California State University, Fullerton. In this video I will be presenting a brief lecture on the ABC Model of Crisis Intervention, which I have been developing and revising over the past 30 years. A complete description of the model and its use with a variety of client populations can be found in the Fifth edition of A Guide to Crisis Intervention published by Cengage Learning. Following this lecture, I will be demonstrating this model with a client. The ABC Model of Crisis Intervention is a method of conducting very brief mental health interviews with clients whose functioning level has decreased following a psychosocial stressor, which I refer to as a precipitating event, and which has usually occurred within four weeks of the crisis state. It is a problem-focused approach in which the focus is identifying the cognitions of the client as they relate to the precipitating event and then altering them to help decrease unmanageable feelings. In addition, providing community referrals and other resources such as reading material is essential in applying this model.

- Definition of a Crisis State 

00:01:35
- Precipitating Event 

00:01:35
- Thoughts and Perceptions 

00:01:35
- Unpleasant and Unmanageable Feelings

- Normal Coping Mechanisms Fail 

00:01:35
- Goal of Crisis Intervention - Offer coping strategies and

Alter-Cognitions 

00:01:35
- Increase functioning to normal of higher level 

00:01:35
KRISTI KANEL The ABC model is based on the definition of a crisis state as including the following: a precipitating event occurs, the client has thoughts and perceptions about this event, that lead to unpleasant and unmanageable feelings which cause a decrease in functioning and normal coping mechanisms fail to help the client function. These aspects will be the focus of the crisis intervention. The goal of crisis work is to offer coping strategies and alter cognitions in order to increase functioning to its normal or higher level. A, developing and maintaining rapport, follow the client. The foundation of crisis intervention is the development of rapport, a state of understanding and comfort between client and counselor. As the client begins to feel the rapport, trust and openness follow, allowing the interview to proceed. Before delving into the client's personal world, the counselor must achieve this personal rapport. Before any work can be done, the client must feel understood and accepted by the counselor. People don't care what you know and tell they know that you care. Everything the counselor asks or says to the client should be related to something the client has just said, so the client can experience that the counselor is actually listening and not just thinking of things to say or following a preset list of questions. Use of these basic rapport, building communication skills invites clients to talk, brings calm control to the situation, allows them to talk about the facts of the situation, helps the counselor to hear and empathize what the client's feelings and let's the client know that the counselor is concerned and respectful. There is no set order in using these skills. Counselors use intuition and verbal following and genuine reactions when responding to clients. Basic attending skills aren't interpretations or advice giving, rather a means to enter the internal world of the client and let the client know you understand what he or she is really going through.

Basic Attending Skills 

00:03:55
A: DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING RAPPORT 

00:03:55
Basic Attending skills 

00:03:55
- Good eye contact 

00:03:55
- Verbal following 

00:03:55
- Minimal Encouragers 

00:03:55
- Interested posture 

00:03:55
Minimal encouragers / head nodding, solid eye contact 

00:03:55
KRISTI KANEL  Basic attending skills, attending behaviors. These include things such as good eye contact, verbal following, minimal encouragers and an interested posture. It's very important to follow what the client says and not bring in pre-thought out ideas. Otherwise the client won't feel that what you're saying is relevant to where they're at. Minimal encouragers are things like nodding your head and saying ah-ah. It shows the client that you're interested and that you want them to keep talking. These are basic to any counseling process.

Questioning 

00:04:35
Basic Attending Skills (continued) 

00:04:35
Questioning 

00:04:35
- Open-ended questions - Invite client to explore more 

00:04:35
- "What", "How" 

00:04:35
- Tie the question to what the client has just said 

00:04:35
- Look for new words or energy behind a word 

00:04:35
- Never assume - Inquire 

00:04:35
- Close-ended questions - "do", "does", "are", "have", "could" when 

00:04:35
facts are needed and during suicide assessment 

00:04:35
- Clarifying - soft - close-ended questions 

00:04:35
- "Are you saying?", "Did you mean?" 

00:04:35
KRISTI KANEL Questioning, open-ended questions. These types of questions invite clients to explore more of what they have spontaneously shared without categories imposed by the interviewer. They allow clients an opportunity to explore their thoughts and feelings without feeling interrogated by the counselor, which closed-ended questions often do. Questions that begin with what and how are effective in allowing clients to explore their ideas and feelings and in moving the interview along, while gathering essential information about the nature of the crisis. Counselors should try to tie the questions to what the client has just said. Verbal following is essential in order to ask pointed open-ended questions as related to what the client just said. Whenever a client offers a new word or expresses energy behind what he or she says, the counselor can ask a question that helps him or her better understand the meaning of the word or the energy. Never assume that you know what the client means, inquire. Closed-ended questions, these questions begin with do, does, are, have and could. Notice that clients can respond to these with a simple yes or no. There is a time and place for this, usually when a fact is needed and during suicide assessments. Although it is true that many counselors must complete forms for their agencies, this does not mean that the interview should be a series of closed-ended questions. Interweaving closed-ended questions with open-ended questions, reflections and paraphrasing, usually allows counselors to complete intake forms for most agencies. Clarifying, clarifications can be thought off as a form of soft closed-ended questions. They're used when a counselor isn't quite sure what the client just said, because maybe the counselor missed a piece of information, because the client was speaking too fast or presented so much information at once the counselor couldn't grasp it at all. The counselor restates in his or her own words, what they thought they heard clients say in a questioning manner beginning the statement with, are you saying or did you mean. It is used to clear up confusion or ambiguity and thus avoid misunderstanding and confirm the accuracy of what the counselor has heard. It is not meant to encourage the client to explore more of what was said, but simply to help counselors make share they understood what was said.

00:07:20
Paraphrasing 

00:07:20
- Restating in counselor's own words the facts and thoughts presented by the client 

00:07:20
Reflection of feelings 

00:07:20
- Empathy 

00:07:20
- Affective part / emotional tone / nonverbal of verbal 

00:07:20
- Stay with the feelings 

00:07:20
- Keep it short and simple 

00:07:20
Summarization 

00:07:20
- Pulls thoughts, feelings, and facts together 

00:07:20
KRISTI KANEL Paraphrasing, paraphrasing is restating in the counselor's own words what the client just said. This shows the client that the counselor understands the basic facts and thoughts of the situation. It establishes empathy and a non-judgmental stance, because I'm not approving or disapproving, just restating. If the counselor didn't quite get what the client just said, the client has the opportunity to correct the counselor and present his or her ideas more clearly. Reflection of feelings, empathy is integral to achieving and maintaining rapport with clients. This means being able to let clients know you understand their feelings. A reflection is a statement that reflects the affective part or emotional tone of the client's message, whether verbal or non-verbal. Reflection is best done immediately following an expression of non-verbal feelings. Like when a client starts crying, we could say, this seems really painful, it could be done after they express their feeling verbally. If a client says I feel really down, you could say, wow, it sounds like this really gets to you, so that you are staying with that feeling and mirroring for them what they're saying. Keeping it short is very helpful too. It keeps the client focused on feelings and nothing else. Keep it simple to help them stay with the feeling. Don't add facts and thoughts, don't add because. There is a tendency to say, you're feeling down because your mother said this to you. You keep them with the feeling more when you just reflect the feeling by itself. If counselors add cognitive or factual information after the reflection of feeling, the client might then focus on something other than the emotion. Summarization, the key purpose of summarization is to help another individual pull his or her thoughts together. A secondary purpose is to check on whether the counselor may have distorted the client's frame of reference. This is a statement that ties together most of the facts, thoughts and feelings presented in the interview. It's very useful when transitioning from the B to C section. It's very useful for beginning counselors as well. Sometimes they are blank and won't know what to say. A summarization will really help a client focus on something that's important for them at that moment. So if I summarize facts and feelings, the client will be hearing it and will think, yeah, that's right, that's what I want to talk about. 

00:10:00
B: IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM 

00:10:00
Follow the Model 

00:10:00
- Identifying Precipitating Events 

00:10:00
- Exploration of thoughts, cognitions, meanings, perceptions 

00:10:00
- Identifying Emotional Distress and Functioning level 

00:10:00
KRISTI KANEL  B, identifying the problem, follow the model. After basic demographic information has been gathered and as rapport is developing, the counselor will need to start focusing on the client's presenting crisis. Keeping in mind the basic aspects of a crisis state is vital in identifying the nature of the problem. These were mentioned at the beginning of this presentation. They will now be addressed more thoroughly, identifying precipitating events. Shortly after the interview begins, the counselor seeks to find out about what happened to trigger the crisis, asking what happened that made you call for an appointment is appropriate. It is an opening for clients to tell what is going on with them. If they cannot think of any particular event that brought them in, the counselor is encouraged to probe further explaining that understanding the trigger of the crisis aids in relieving the crisis state. It is vital to pinpoint the precipitating event in order to be able to understand the thoughts and feelings that brought the client in. No matter how much clients profess that nothing has happened really, something drove them to seek help. We must squeeze it out of them. They must see that their current state of emotional distress is tied to an actual event. Remember the client's thoughts are related to this event. And if we don't know the event, we cannot properly explore thoughts about it and then alter those thoughts, exploration of thoughts, cognitions, perceptions and meanings. Another thing we need to identify are the perceptions, thoughts and meanings about the situation. A good portion of this B section is involved with exploring these cognitions. We really want to understand the entire cognitive schema going on inside this person to get a full idea of what's going on, so we can later attempt to alter cognitions. We really can't alter cognitions unless we know what those cognitions are. Clients very rarely present with cognitions. It's very rare for a client to come in and say, I'm here because I'm thinking bad stuff about myself or my situation. So we generally have to ask many questions related to that. Asking questions such as these help to begin the cognitive exploratory process. How do you put it together in your head? What do you think about this? What does it mean to you that? What are you telling yourself about? What assumptions are you making about? Once the first thought is given by the client the counselor must continue to inquire about deeper and related thoughts. It is only when the counselor truly understands the wave of perceptions and thoughts that he or she can help the client think differently about the situation. Identifying emotional distress and functioning level. We also want to identify their emotional distress. Often times clients present with emotional issues rather than a precipitating event. They'll come in and say, I've been very depressed lately or I've been feeling very scared or guilty. So it's not hard to get emotions out of people because that's generally what brings them in, but we do want to make sure we attend to those feelings and understand them. And if clients do not tell us of their emotional distress, we need to inquire directly as to how they have been feeling. We also want to understand their functioning level. This also might bring somebody in, maybe they present and say, I've been having difficulty in school, I can't concentrate on work, I haven't been able to eat or sleep lately. Often times, impairment in functioning will bring somebody in, and if that is what they began their session with, we start with that. And then we form our questions so that we can access information about perceptions, subjective distress, precipitating events and functioning. We then tie them altogether to get a clear picture of the crisis state. It is helpful to understand how their functioning level was prior to the crisis in order to evaluate the outcome of the crisis intervention. Remember the goal of crisis intervention is to bring the client back to pre-crisis level of functioning.

B: IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM (continued) 

00:14:20
Making Ethical Checks 

00:14:20
- Suicide Assessment 

00:14:20
- Homicidal / Abuse Issues 

00:14:20
- Medical / organic concerns / Serious Mental Illness 

00:14:20
- Serious Substance Dependence 

00:14:20
- May involve referral to a physician 

00:14:20
KRISTI KANEL  Making ethical checks. We also at some point may need to identify any ethical concerns. This information is typically a part of most intake forms for most agencies and modern health maintenance organizations. Ethical checks can be done as part of the interview, rather than just thrown at the client. If rapports built first, clients tend to be more forthcoming about these vulnerable and sometimes scary areas. Suicide assessment is always a potential risk for people in crisis. So it's not inappropriate for any mental health professional ever to simply identify and assess whether the person has suicidal ideation that is thoughts of suicide. If they do, you have to do a formal suicide assessment to understand the risk level. The sessions in the video will include a suicide assessment. Homicidal or abuse issues are other ethical checks that need to be done in a crisis interview. Being a danger to others has to be considered and we may have to do some reporting to the police if that's the case. This includes child abuse, elder abuse and disabled adult abuse. Another ethical concern has to do with medical or organic concerns and any serious mental illness. We have to be aware that if that's an issue we have to connect this person with appropriate physicians. This may also include those clients suffering from serious substance dependence or abuse, as this may also require some involvement of a physician other than just a mental health professional.

00:16:00
Therapeutic Interactions 

00:16:00
THERAPEUTIC INTERACTIONS 

00:16:00
Altering Cognition: Nonlinear 

00:16:00
- Validation Statements - Feelings and experience is understandable 

00:16:00
- Education Statements - Providing factual information 

00:16:00
- Empowering Statements - Take back personal power by making helpful 

00:16:00
choices now, moving from victim to survivor 

00:16:00
- Reframing Statements - Offer a way out of a problem that allows the 

00:16:00
person to preserve the integrity of the self and the family unit reducing 

00:16:00
the feelings of shame 

00:16:00
KRISTI KANEL Therapeutic interactions, once we understand the crisis state, we can begin to alter cognitions. However, I don't want to present this as a linear model. Sometimes we are altering cognitions as they're presented to us. It has to happen intuitively as the counselor starts to think about it. It has to be related and relevant to what the client says. While the sessions are being viewed by you, there will be subtitles, when one of these interactive statements is being made by me to help you follow along. Validation statements, one approach to altering cognitions is what we call validation statements. These led the client know what she is feeling and experiencing is understandable. That it is difficult and that she is entitled to feel what she is feeling. So we want to make statements like that is hard, that is difficult, totally understandable to be feeling like that. Most people in this situation do feel this way. This will help the person not feel so abnormal like something is wrong with them. They will feel more connected that you understand them and that you are not judging them. It might help clients not see themselves as sick, weak or bad. Educational statements, providing factual information is vital in every crisis. Clients often suffer merely because they lack or have incorrect knowledge about the situation. Thus it is imperative for counselors to gather as much information as possible about each crisis situation, either through formal academic course, books or supervision. Educational statements may include psychological, social and interpersonal dynamics, statistics or frequency of the problem. Counselors are passing down knowledge we learned in college to our clients. Empowering statements, for clients who are in crisis situation in which they feel violated, victimized or helpless, empowering statements may help them take back personal power by making helpful choices now. These statements help them move from a position of feeling powerless to feeling that they have some control and choice in their life now. The goal is to change the mindset from victim to survivor. Reframing statements, reframing is defining a situation differently from the way the client is defining it. It is a cognitive restructuring tactic that aims at changing the crisis from danger to opportunity. If we can believe that something positive or beneficial would be an outcome or result of the problem, we can usually integrate the difficult episode more easily. The counselor's responsibility is to be creative in finding the right reframe which means actively searching the positive. This is an advanced technique that puts problems in a solvable form by changing the meanings of behaviors and situations and provides a new perspective which opens up new possibilities for change. Reframing is possible only if the counselor first understands fully the client's current frame of reference. Counselors can learn the client's frame of reference by asking direct questions such as how do you perceive the situation? what does it mean to you? Reframing offers a way out of a problem that allows the person to preserve the integrity of the self and the family unit as well. Because reframes are usually offered with the person's self-identity in mind, shame is reduced and self-integrity is preserved. Moving into C. Once the counselor has identified the crisis and offered new ways of thinking about it, a strong summarization is in order to help move smoothly into the final stage and get the client out the door in better shape than when they first walked in. 

00:19:55
C: COPING 

00:19:55
- Explore client's attempts at coping and have client ponder what they 

00:19:55
would like to do 

00:19:55
- Present alternative coping behaviors 

00:19:55
- Support Groups 

00:19:55
- 12 step groups 

00:19:55
- Medical exam 

00:19:55
- Legal assistance 

00:19:55
- Agencies 

00:19:55
- Commitment and Follow up 

00:19:55
KRISTI KANEL C, coping, the first step is exploring the client's own attempts at coping. The most important thing to remember about moving into this section is to have clients think about what they would like to do to begin to resolve their situation before the counselor starts offering ideas. By having the clients ponder their own ideas, they're more likely to follow through with them. Narrative therapy has shown this to be effective in recent evidence-based practice studies. It's also a starting point for me the counselor to think of different things for the client to do. The point is, I don't want them to resist my referrals and my interventions, and if it comes from them, chances are they're going to follow through. I want to ask clients what they would like to do to get through this crisis. During the educational statements, I might have seeded some ideas that they may have been pondering like educating them on the fact that codependency is so common that 12 step groups have been created to provide support for those living with an alcoholic, or maybe I had educated the person about new techniques that people suffering from PTSD have been using such as EMDR. Often the client will respond to the question, what do you think would be a good place to start or what do you think might help you by saying that, that 12 step group I had mentioned sounds good. They might also give other ideas such as exercising or reading or writing. When they give me some ideas I'm going to ask them for more. What are the things can you think of? I really want to thoroughly exhaust their inventory of what they like to do. Presenting alternative coping behaviors. Once I hear what they like to do I often then have some ideas on what I think they should do. I also have ideas on what I think they could do based on my experience and knowledge of what would really work in various situations. So then I might begin offering the client ideas after that. I might refer them to a support group. Support groups are very valuable. They're usually groups run by a professional with people going through the same situation. And these different -- these are different from 12 step groups or mutual self-help groups. These are groups usually not run by a therapist, you might have heard of some like Alcoholics Anonymous, Al-Anon, Overeaters Anonymous. These 12 step groups are formed and they're very useful as referrals because they're usually very low fee or no fee at all. You can access them seven days a week, three to four times a day. So they are an excellent resource for people who need something that is useful, effective and very cost effective. I might refer them for a medication evaluation by a psychiatrist if I really felt there was some serious symptoms going on, severe depression or anything severe like panic disorder or severe anxiety disorder. I might encourage them to get a physical examination from their own doctor if that seems to be an issue. If I were working with a victim of rape I might have already seeded the idea of getting a medical exam earlier. I might recommend legal assistance, perhaps they need help getting a restraining order or maybe there is a child custody situation. I might encourage them to seek a lawyer for that. Often in an empowerment statement to a victim of domestic violence, I talk about her choices, one being to press charges. There are many agencies and shelters or other clinicians that I might refer them to, such as someone who specializes in marriage counseling or family counseling or other specialties, maybe EMDR, which is eye movement desensitization and reprocessing for people suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Sometimes when encouraging clients to explore new coping, they mentioned something that has worked in the past. I might encourage them to do this again, at this point or offer ideas that I think might help such as journaling, reading, exercising, attending classes and a multitude of other things. Commitment and follow up. Once I've given referrals and I've given my ideas, I want to get a commitment from this client that they're going to do this and I want to establish some follow up. Before I end the session I want to make sure the client has a definite plan of action and is committed to following through with that action. If clients presented at low risk or middle risk suicide, I would make a no suicide contract before they leave the office. I would also set up a specific time to speak again.

00:24:45
KRISTI KANEL A common phenomenon when working with the issue of loss is the impact that previous deaths have on someone's current functioning and ability to withstand new losses. The client in this video has suffered several losses including the death of her son and three siblings. Her most recent loss is her sister. This has triggered grief feelings from her previous losses. Grief work typically includes a psychoeducational discussion of both Kubler-Ross' stages of death and dying and Worden's Tasks of Mourning. Grief counselors must assess the stage of grief the client is in and then guide the client toward resolution of that stage and movement into the next stage. Additionally, counselors must take into consideration, individual differences in terms of how a person response to loss such as the relation to the deceased, the nature of the attachment, whether the deceased provided strength, support or security, the mode of death, prior grief experiences and religious beliefs. Thank you for coming today Wayne, I really appreciate you coming. So I know there has been some things that have been going on with you. And today in our session, I'd like you to just feel free to talk about whatever is on your mind and whatever it is you think we can work on today. 

00:26:10
UNKNOWN Thank you. I'm here because I recently lost my sister. 

00:26:15
Open-ended question / cognitive question 

00:26:15
KRISTI KANEL When you say you lost your sister what do you mean? 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN She died. She died. 

00:26:20
KRISTI KANEL I'm so sorry to hear that. 

00:26:20
Minimal encouragers / head nodding, solid eye contact 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN Thank you. So -- but -- I'm here because last Saturday I had such a breakdown, they had an event at the church and you know, I just started thinking about you know, her because that would have been a great thing for her to be there with me. And out on the way to church, I just kept on crying, uncontrollably and my husband was trying to, you know, but only I understand, he only can confer so much, so I said I really need to kind of see somebody. 

00:26:50
Reflection of feelings 

00:26:50
KRISTI KANEL I can clearly see this is very difficult for you emotionally. 

00:26:55
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. It is. 

00:26:55
KRISTI KANEL When did your sister pass? 

00:27:00
Trying to understand precipitating event 

00:27:00
UNKNOWN She passed February the second. 

00:27:00
KRISTI KANEL February the second, and how did she die? 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN They called me on Saturday and told me that she was in a surgery, I had no idea and then they called me Sunday and said she had passed away. And they said she had this disease septic and it just hit, took overall her organs and you know, so she just, you know, she wouldn't have made it even if she would have lived. 

00:27:25
Reflection of nonverbal feeling 

00:27:25
KRISTI KANEL  It still brings tears to your eyes as soon as you think about that. 

00:27:30
UNKNOWN It's hard because she was the baby, you know, you expect your parents or you to go before the youngest and she was the youngest, so it was really hard for me. 

00:27:40
Connecting feelings with thought 

00:27:40
KRISTI KANEL That's part of what hurts is, she is youngest and you thought that she would be around for a while. 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. 

00:27:45
Reflection of nonverbal feeling 

00:27:45
KRISTI KANEL So I can definitely see the pain there. 

00:27:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:27:50
KRISTI KANEL That's so hard. And then you're saying last week you went to this church function. 

00:27:55
Identifying the precipitating event 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN  Yes. 

00:28:00
KRISTI KANEL And you said you broke down crying? 

00:28:00
UNKNOWN Yes, yes, on a way there, I was in the car and just thinking about, you know, they was talking only power women and women health and, you know, we used to talk, we had just started talking, she was doing well, that's why I was so surprised, I heard her death was like so suddenly, but it was all the things that could have helped her, you know, in her life, you know, with her health and, you know, with her self-esteem, all those things they was talking about and her not being able to be there and share that with me that was really difficult for me. 

00:28:30
Connecting precipitating event with cognitions 

00:28:30
KRISTI KANEL So that event triggered in you these thoughts about how your sister could have, if she lived, she would have benefitted. 

00:28:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:28:35
KRISTI KANEL  And it just really made you think about all that -- sounds like all that she was missing out on. 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN  Yes. 

00:28:45
KRISTI KANEL You really have such a deep connection to her. 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:28:45
KRISTI KANEL Like it sounds like such a strong love or bond between the two of you. 

00:28:50
UNKNOWN Yes and that was hard because she is not here, but, you know, I don't want to every time some like to happen breakdown, and you know, that's the part, you know, that's hard for me. 

00:29:05
Identifying impairments in functioning 

00:29:05
KRISTI KANEL Since her passing have -- have you been struggling with other areas of your life, has it affected you in school or other, how so? 

00:29:15
UNKNOWN Yes, because first I couldn't function, I'm like my thoughts was all over the place, you know, trying to, you know, study, I wasn't able to focus and you know, just barely getting through the day, you know, I just started counting the hours and counting the days, you know, then counting the weeks, you know, just like a countdown, I can make it, you know, and that was my attitude and you know, at home I don't want to do nothing, but lay down, you know, thank god, my family was supportive, but, you know, and then I don't want to be around people. 

00:29:45
KRISTI KANEL Were you able to have some relationship with your family at least? 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN Yes, yes, they understood, they -- I talked and explained to them, you know, that is not personal, it's just that right now, you know, I'm trying to just do everything I can to keep myself going, to keep myself together, you know to daily just function. 

00:30:05
KRISTI KANEL It sounds like you are oversleeping a little bit. 

00:30:05
UNKNOWN  Yes. 

00:30:10
KRISTI KANEL Oversleeping, what about eating, you are able to -- 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN Overeating. 

00:30:10
KRISTI KANEL Overeating. 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN  Yes, yes, yes, and sleeping, you know, just, you know waking up and you know, the thoughts running through your mind, what could or should, what I could have did, you know, what I should have did, you know. 

00:30:25
Cognitive exploration 

00:30:25
KRISTI KANEL What should you have done? 

00:30:30
UNKNOWN the outcome would have been the same when I researched the disease, outcome would have been the same, but, you know, I just feel, you know, I guess hopeless, helpless, you know. What I could have did, I don't know. 

00:30:45
KRISTI KANEL Yeah, you feel powerless. 

00:30:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:30:45
KRISTI KANEL Like there was are you used to thinking that there's nothing you, sounds like you are saying there's nothing you could have done and yet part of you is thinking I could have done something. 

00:30:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:30:55
KRISTI KANEL Like there is an ambivalence going on there. 

00:31:00
UNKNOWN I wish I would have spent more time with her. And I wish that, you know, she would have communicated to me what was going on with her, I think that was the hardest thing is, you know, all this was going on for a month and no one told me. So, you know -- 

00:31:15
KRISTI KANEL What does it mean to you that she didn't communicate, what was going on with her? 

00:31:20
UNKNOWN I was angry, angry not at her, but at the situation that, you know, I won't be left out and I won't have the chase, you know, to, you know, help her or see her. 

00:31:40
KRISTI KANEL Because if you haven't seen her -- 

00:31:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:31:40
KRISTI KANEL What would that mean to you, if you've had that chance to see her? 

00:31:45
UNKNOWN Just like her husband says she had been like that often now for a month and for them not telling me I could have made her go to the hospital sooner, you know to check it out or what was going on with them, you know, I guess I'm mad at myself too, but -- 

00:32:00
KRISTI KANEL What you're mad at yourself about? 

00:32:05
UNKNOWN Because I should have, I don't know I don't know, I just felt like I should have been more attuned with what was going on with her even though she was telling me everything was all right, should have been attuned even more. 

00:32:20
KRISTI KANEL So, she -- she told you everything was okay. 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:32:20
KRISTI KANEL But you are still thinking that you should have known stuff even if she told you otherwise. 

00:32:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:32:30
Clarification of cognitions 

00:32:30
KRISTI KANEL How could you have known stuff, if she was telling you otherwise, how do you put that together in your head that you could have known that. 

00:32:35
UNKNOWN Just in thoughts, I know they are not right thoughts, but that is just a way I'm thinking like that. 

00:32:45
Validation/Education about stages of grief 

00:32:45
KRISTI KANEL Well, it's -- you know, it's natural to -- for people to feel some anger. 

00:32:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:32:50
KRISTI KANEL You know, you're probably aware you've heard of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross' stages of grief. You know, the first stage is shock and I still think that you're probably a little -- still a bit in shock or at least you definitely were in shock when you first found out about her passing. 

00:33:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:33:05
KRISTI KANEL And now and then recently you've been feeling more and more anger, and that's the second stage of Kubler-Ross' stages is to feel some anger and a large part of that is feeling powerless. 

00:33:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:33:15
KRISTI KANEL Some of its feeling almost like survivor guilt or -- 

00:33:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:33:20
KRISTI KANEL I could have, I should have and so anger is that next stage and the next stage is bargaining, but I don't know that there could be any bargaining at this point. 

00:33:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:33:30
KRISTI KANEL You know, and then eventually there's depression and you kind of going back and forth between it sounds like depression and anger. 

00:33:35
UNKNOWN Yes, I am. 

00:33:35
Reframe anger as necessary to move through mourning 

00:33:35
Education about tasks of mourning 

00:33:35
KRISTI KANEL You know, working through those feelings and the -- actually the anger is a positive thing, it shows that you are kind of accepting the loss as real, because there's -- there's stages people have to work through in mourning, okay, and you may have heard of Worden's Tasks of Mourning. Well, the first stage is to accept the loss as real, that's how we get through grief and it sounds like, because you're in anger, it's kind of indicative that you're accepting the loss as real. The next task is just to feel the feelings and grief and that means letting yourself feel anger and guilt and depression and all those feelings. You have to feel all of that stuff, even though it hurts and it doesn't feel good. 

00:34:20
UNKNOWN  Yes it did. 

00:34:25
KRISTI KANEL And unfortunately for you it's affecting your functioning and that's -- that part is not good, but eventually in order to move to the next stage which is kind of adjusting to life without your sister, to be able do that you have to actually actively feel all those feelings. 

00:34:40
UNKNOWN That's right. 

00:34:40
KRISTI KANEL And then eventually move towards adjusting to life without her, but that could take a whole year or so at least. 

00:34:50
UNKNOWN That's another thing, it's like everyone around me trying to watch me, they feel like I should get pass it and I asked just -- 

00:34:55
KRISTI KANEL It's only been a month, but, you know, everybody is grieving in their own way too. 

00:35:00
Education/Reframe others' behavior as their own grieving 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:35:00
KRISTI KANEL Your family members are grieving the loss of her as well. 

00:35:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:35:05
KRISTI KANEL And you know, you might have a special meaning in your heart for her that maybe they don't, it's your sister. 

00:35:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:35:15
KRISTI KANEL And you baby sister. 

00:35:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:35:15
KRISTI KANEL And it meant a lot to you and you wanted her to have a full life. 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN Yes. That's ideal. 

00:35:20
KRISTI KANEL And I'm imagining as elder sister you probably you were thinking you could have done something to help her, you were saying. 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:35:30
KRISTI KANEL So you have all those feelings that they don't have and so they are not at the same level of your grief that you're at. 

00:35:35
UNKNOWN  Okay. 

00:35:40
KRISTI KANEL Yeah. So, they kind of don't know what to do. Most people in our society, they don't know how to handle when somebody is grieving. They don't want to bring it up for fear, oh, I'm going to make her feel bad. 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN Right, right. I see that. 

00:35:50
KRISTI KANEL And yet part of what people need and what you need to get through this is to talk about it, is to feel it. 

00:36:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:36:00
KRISTI KANEL Because that's going to help you move into the adjustment period, and you know, and you know, I don't know have you -- have you lost anybody else that you can that -- 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. And that is what happened triggered into, I had a son that I lost 10 years ago and you know, that was one of the hardest things for me to do about eight years, I mean, two years ago I was triggered so hard, I -- when I sort some help then, you know, and so when she passed away, it was just like I was reliving, you know, that pain all over again, you know. 

00:36:35
KRISTI KANEL Well I can see you're feeling that pain right now. 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. I know. 

00:36:40
Maintaining rapport via attending skills / Reflection 

00:36:40
KRISTI KANEL Just mentioning your son, just retriggered a lot of that pain. 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. 

00:36:45
KRISTI KANEL So this loss of your sister is triggering those feelings of loss for your son. 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. 

00:36:50
Validating and Education 

00:36:50
KRISTI KANEL And even though that was 10 years ago, it's still very real for you right now. 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN Right, right, right, because you know, he died in hospital too. So -- 

00:37:00
KRISTI KANEL Oh, boy. 

00:37:00
UNKNOWN  You know, it's hard, it's hard, it's real hard. 

00:37:05
Cognitive Exploration 

00:37:05
KRISTI KANEL And what's the hardest part of the loss of your son for you. 

00:37:10
UNKNOWN Both of them not being able to hear their voice, not being able to talk to them, you know, I miss them most especially on a holiday not being able to reach out and talk to them and that's hard. 

00:37:25
KRISTI KANEL So, talking to your son or talking to your sister. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:37:30
KRISTI KANEL This was what you'd want to do. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:37:30
KRISTI KANEL What does that mean to you particularly to get to talk to them. 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN You know, just to hear their voice, you know, and my son, he is -- he was just a jokester, you know, joking, and her, she, you know, she has such a uplift spirit about her, you know, always was positive and you know, they had grown up together, you know, you don't have that with everybody, you know, but which a sibling you have childhood memories that you could talk about, like my mom is ambivalence, so we could talk about her and you know how she used to be at different things like that and I won't have, I won't be able to share that, I can share it, but it wouldn't have the same meaning where someone else says it does with her or him. 

00:38:15
Reframe tragedy as indicative of the deep connection 

00:38:15
KRISTI KANEL So, those shared memories and that special connection, I'm -- I was just thinking how -- how tragic it is to lose someone that you are so close to and yet how -- how wonderful it is to have had such a bond. I always hear about these people who are alienated from their siblings and they don't have that special connection and just thinking about wow, you had that, that's always in your heart. 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:38:45
KRISTI KANEL That specialness, that's what makes it hurt so bad though. 

00:38:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:38:50
KRISTI KANEL From the loss because it was so special. 

00:38:50
UNKNOWN  Yes. 

00:38:55
KRISTI KANEL I love hearing about you saying, she had such a spirit about her. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN Yes, she did. 

00:39:00
KRISTI KANEL That touched me deeply when you said that. 

00:39:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:39:05
KRISTI KANEL Because that's inside if you -- I imagined her spirit feels you still. 

00:39:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:39:10
KRISTI KANEL When I see you say it, I see you sparkle up a little bit. 

00:39:10
UNKNOWN  Yes, yes. I love that about her. 

00:39:15
KRISTI KANEL That's always there. 

00:39:20
UNKNOWN Yes. She love people too. There's something, two things we have in common, she love people and she loved to be around people. 

00:39:25
KRISTI KANEL And then you brought up your son, and there was something special you said about him, you want to hear his voice. 

00:39:35
UNKNOWN Jokes and -- 

00:39:35
KRISTI KANEL Jokester, that's right. 

00:39:35
UNKNOWN He even pranks on everybody that just, you know, was his personality. You know, he always, you know, at all my kids, he could say anything and get away with it with me because of the way he done it, you know, in the joking way. 

00:39:50
Close-ended question to get a fact 

00:39:50
KRISTI KANEL How many children do you have? 

00:39:50
UNKNOWN I have nine children. 

00:39:55
KRISTI KANEL Nine children. 

00:39:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:39:55
KRISTI KANEL So, that's a pretty big family. 

00:39:55
UNKNOWN  Yes, yes. 

00:40:00
KRISTI KANEL And it -- and it -- it's just reminding me right now, it doesn't matter how many people are in your family, the loss of one, it's special. 

00:40:05
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. 

00:40:05
KRISTI KANEL It's special to you. 

00:40:05
UNKNOWN Can't be replaced. 

00:40:10
Validation 

00:40:10
KRISTI KANEL Cannot be replaced. 

00:40:10
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. Even though I have nine, eight more, yes. 

00:40:15
KRISTI KANEL Because you had such a strong connection with him and her. 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:40:20
KRISTI KANEL You know and so -- 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN And they kind of grow up together, because he as younger, he was the -- he was the first grandbaby in the house. So they grew up together, both of them. 

00:40:30
KRISTI KANEL Oh, interesting. 

00:40:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:40:30
KRISTI KANEL  Okay. So that's such a special memory and you know, I was -- here I was thinking about earlier how you said, you felt powerless. They both passed in hospitals and what is similar you're bringing up the similarities between the two of them, they're both passed and like you can't do anything about that and -- 

00:40:50
UNKNOWN No. 

00:40:50
KRISTI KANEL You said you felt powerless and helpless and I'm just thinking I mean, I know they were so special and you miss them, and had this triggered any feelings and view to, to want to do anything to hurt yourself or have you had thoughts of -- 

00:41:10
Suicide Assessment 

00:41:10
UNKNOWN No. 

00:41:10
KRISTI KANEL Wanting to suicide or anything like that. 

00:41:10
UNKNOWN No, just the isolation that, that I don't like being isolated, but thinking I don't want to be around people. 

00:41:20
KRISTI KANEL Okay. 

00:41:20
UNKNOWN You know, but I never -- 

00:41:20
KRISTI KANEL But nothing, suicidal -- 

00:41:20
UNKNOWN No. 

00:41:20
KRISTI KANEL Because when I hear worthless and helpless, sometimes I do get concerned and when somebody is depressed. 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN No. 

00:41:25
KRISTI KANEL Sometimes, we can go into a very dark place. 

00:41:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:41:30
KRISTI KANEL But it sounds like you don't do that, you're just isolating and parted to be around people. 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:41:35
KRISTI KANEL But maybe some of that's because they understand you. 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. And I have to keep on explaining, you know, I don't want to talk about what happened to her. I don't want to talk, well I'm not like in the same or you know, what's going on with me, you know -- 

00:41:55
KRISTI KANEL It sounds like they just don't understand your grieving. 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. 

00:42:00
KRISTI KANEL They don't get it because they don't feel it. 

00:42:00
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:42:00
KRISTI KANEL They don't have that special connection you had. 

00:42:05
Continuing the reframe 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN I guess -- 

00:42:05
KRISTI KANEL Nobody gets that, but you. 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN Yes. It's hard. But I know they love me. 

00:42:10
KRISTI KANEL But you have that. 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN Yes. I know they love me and want the best from me, but right now -- 

00:42:15
KRISTI KANEL I know but -- so you have that with your sister and your son that other people didn't have. 

00:42:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:42:20
KRISTI KANEL You'll always have that. 

00:42:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:42:20
KRISTI KANEL It's like a treasure inside of you, that's always there. 

00:42:25
UNKNOWN Yes. I didn't see it that way, yes, yes. 

00:42:30
KRISTI KANEL Yeah. And I get that it's hard to want to talk to people who don't understand. 

00:42:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:42:35
KRISTI KANEL Because they -- it seems like people just want to move on with their life, you get that, the burst of casseroles and cards and sympathy -- 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:42:45
KRISTI KANEL And all that stuff, and then everybody kind of just carries on and you are like left, you're like, great, now what do I do. 

00:42:50
UNKNOWN  Yes. 

00:42:55
Seeding the idea of grief groups 

00:42:55
KRISTI KANEL And that's why they've kind of created, there's like grief groups for people, you know, to actually get together and do -- you know, and talk about it, because it kind of seem to be the only ones who understand. 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN Yes, that would be great. 

00:43:05
KRISTI KANEL You know, I mean, because just talking to your family and friends, it's almost more frustrating. 

00:43:10
UNKNOWN Yes, yes, it is. 

00:43:10
Continue educating about normal grief work 

00:43:10
KRISTI KANEL And yet you're doing the right thing by crying and feeling your pain. It really means you've accepted the loss as real and that you could move into adjustment throughout the year. And you're going to have to adjust to every birthday, Mother's Day, holidays, all of that, you're going to have to kind of get through before you can begin that adjustment process, that's part of the adjustment process. 

00:43:35
UNKNOWN  Yes. 

00:43:40
KRISTI KANEL And you know, I don't -- everybody takes their own time, there's no set period of grief. 

00:43:45
UNKNOWN Thank you. Thank you. I need to hear that. 

00:43:45
Moving into C: Coping 

00:43:45
KRISTI KANEL  Yeah. What have you done so far to kind of help yourself, I mean, she passed in February and I know last week was triggered you. 

00:44:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:44:00
KRISTI KANEL To really have kind of what you call a little mini breakdown. 

00:44:05
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:44:05
KRISTI KANEL What kinds of things have you done at all to kind of help you through this? 

00:44:10
UNKNOWN Even though I had the breakdown going to the convention, it -- all the things they was talking about kind of refreshed me. And -- 

00:44:20
KRISTI KANEL So getting -- it is almost like going to and hearing -- 

00:44:20
UNKNOWN  Right. 

00:44:25
KRISTI KANEL Motivational talks and inspirational things. 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:44:25
KRISTI KANEL That helped you. 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN  Yes. And going to school, I thank God I'm still going to school, because it keep me going. 

00:44:35
KRISTI KANEL How does school -- how do you think that helps you? 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN Because, I had to focus in on what I'm reading, I had to focus in on what the professor is saying, even though I don't want to, but I have to. And studying, I had to focus in, so that's kind of a cause in me to gather my thoughts, I have to be in the present when I'm in school and when I'm in class, and when I'm interacting and that, I thank God I'm still going to school. 

00:45:00
KRISTI KANEL So, schooling, kind of inspirational talks, is there anything else you can think of that would help you. 

00:45:05
Exploring Client's ideas of coping 

00:45:05
UNKNOWN Yes. Standing here, sitting here talking to you about it is a big help, because I don't as you are biased, you know, you're not family, so I can say whatever I want to say and cry if I want to cry and don't have to worry about you, you know, hugging me, kind of starting like kind of cutting off my emotions, that's really helping me. 

00:45:30
KRISTI KANEL So talking to somebody who encourages you to feel your pain. 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:45:35
KRISTI KANEL And thus it's hard to take it away. 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:45:35
KRISTI KANEL You feel some relief on that. 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN Yes. That helps a lot. 

00:45:40
KRISTI KANEL Can you think of anything else that would help you a little bit? 

00:45:40
UNKNOWN Well I tried journaling, but, put my emotions on paper is real hard for me. I guess, because it's so many, and when I started to write, it's so much anger came out on the paper that that's a part in me I don't like and so -- 

00:46:00
KRISTI KANEL What don't you like about that anger? 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN Because that's a part in my personality, I just don't like being angry with people and so when see it written down, I don't like it, that's the only way I can explain it to you. 

00:46:15
KRISTI KANEL You're angry at some specific people. 

00:46:20
Non linear approach - return to B to explore 

00:46:20
cognitions using basic attending skills 

00:46:20
UNKNOWN Yes I am. Yes I am. I'm angry at them keeping that front of me, I am, and so when I see it down on paper. 

00:46:30
KRISTI KANEL  And you don't like that you're angry? 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN It don't resolve anything of putting it down resolved it and help me to get pass it, I could do it, but I don't see that, I don't get that benefit from putting it down. 

00:46:45
KRISTI KANEL So, something that might be useful for you is to figure out a way to resolve that anger. 

00:46:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:46:50
KRISTI KANEL  Because that seems to be pressing for you right now. 

00:46:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:46:55
KRISTI KANEL You're feeling really angry. 

00:46:55
UNKNOWN  Yes. 

00:47:00
KRISTI KANEL Yeah, well like I said that anger, its part of the grief process, it's weird to think about that though, because you think even someone passes away, why would you feel angry about it. 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:47:10
KRISTI KANEL But it just seems to be something that most everybody experiences when somebody very close to them passes away, that's a lot of anger and some of that is due to feeling powerless and helpless. I could have done something, why didn't I do something, what more could I have done, why didn't they do these things right, so that's really hard to accept that we are powerless over certain things that's very hard. So what have you done to try to work on that anger so far. 

00:47:45
UNKNOWN I've been talking to a counselor also at the school. 

00:47:50
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Is that helping? 

00:47:50
UNKNOWN Yes, it is. It's really helping. I see myself as, not as angry, I do see myself, you know, moving towards some things just talking it out without a person judging or trying to stop me like I say from grieving and I have even got to the point where I don't cry when I talk, I feel I'm going in the right direction. 

00:48:15
KRISTI KANEL Can you -- is there else you think you can do for that anger? 

00:48:20
UNKNOWN Talk to the people that how I'm angry is, but I want to do it in a way where I'm helping the -- 

00:48:25
KRISTI KANEL  Who would that be exactly? 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN Her husband. 

00:48:30
KRISTI KANEL Her husband. 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN Her husband. 

00:48:30
KRISTI KANEL So you think by having a talk with him and expressing your feelings that might help you? 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. 

00:48:35
KRISTI KANEL Now I know you don't like to journal. What would you say about writing out a script of what you would like to say to him? 

00:48:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:48:45
KRISTI KANEL And maybe rehearsing that before you talk to him. 

00:48:45
UNKNOWN  Okay. 

00:48:50
KRISTI KANEL So that you could say it in the way that it feels right for you and gets the point across. 

00:48:55
UNKNOWN It sound good. 

00:48:55
Offers coping idea with reframe 

00:48:55
KRISTI KANEL Because I suspect you and he are two people grieving most about this. 

00:49:00
UNKNOWN I believe so. 

00:49:00
KRISTI KANEL And there is that shared experience you and he would have. 

00:49:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:49:05
KRISTI KANEL And maybe that would be something you could write in that script to him. 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:49:10
KRISTI KANEL That you are sharing this grief together. So all the people in the world perhaps you and he would be feeling it the most. 

00:49:20
UNKNOWN Sound okay, yes. 

00:49:25
KRISTI KANEL And finding that way, he didn't tell you, you know, really trying to understand from his perspective why he didn't share that with you? What was going on there? So I think that sometimes helps relieve the anger if you really truly understand somebody else's motivation. 

00:49:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:49:40
KRISTI KANEL That might be something to think about. Anything else you can think of, are you doing anything like because I know sometimes going for walks. 

00:49:50
UNKNOWN Exercise. 

00:49:50
KRISTI KANEL Exercise helps a little bit. We have a beautiful, the arboretum here it's a beautiful lovely walk sometimes if you have a chance during the middle of the day while you are here on campus taking a beautiful walk listening to the birds and being with nature a little bit can help. 

00:50:05
UNKNOWN Okay. And I do pray. 

00:50:10
KRISTI KANEL You do pray. 

00:50:10
UNKNOWN Yes, I do. 

00:50:10
KRISTI KANEL So do you find that helpful? 

00:50:10
UNKNOWN Yes, yes, meditation and prayer. 

00:50:15
KRISTI KANEL So you are going -- you go to church, doing practice. 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:50:15
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Do you find that to be helpful, you said you like inspirational thoughts. 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. 

00:50:20
KRISTI KANEL So you will continue with that? 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN Yes, I will and I do listen to things on the radio. And yes I do all of that 

00:50:30
KRISTI KANEL So before we end today let me just, I just want to make sure that we -- you have a good feeling of where you might want to move to at this point, continue with your counseling. 

00:50:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:50:40
KRISTI KANEL And then perhaps write up a little script or something you would like to say to her husband. 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN Yes, that's clear. 

00:50:45
Encourage client to continue with effective 

00:50:45
coping behaviors 

00:50:45
Commitment/summarization of coping 

00:50:45
KRISTI KANEL Be thinking about the idea that you and he have the shared grief experience, remember, he is in horrible grief as well and maybe that would be something to help you, think a little bit, focus on that a little bit and maybe do some walks out in beautiful nature, pray, continue your praying and going to church and listening to others and, you know, maybe even think about a grief group. 

00:51:10
UNKNOWN Yes, I have been there. That's what I did a couple of years ago, I went to GriefShare 

00:51:15
KRISTI KANEL So that might be something else you might want to consider because those people never get tired of listening. 

00:51:20
UNKNOWN I think that will be a great idea. 

00:51:20
KRISTI KANEL Okay. So I want to really thank you so much for coming today and now we are going to be talking with a colleague of mine, Tiffany, we are going to talk a little bit about how this session went. 

00:51:35
UNKNOWN Okay. Thank you so much. You have really helped me. 

00:51:35
KRISTI KANEL Thank you. So now let's just discuss that session a little bit so that the audience watching can kind of understand what went on and I brought my colleague Tiffany Atalla Hernandez, a licensed Marriage and Family Therapist who specializes in crisis counseling in the community. And she has been watching the session and so I'm going to ask her some questions and so she can help us understand what's being going on here, and I'll ask you a few questions too. First of all, how are you feeling after that session? 

00:52:05
UNKNOWN  Relief, like a release. 

00:52:10
KRISTI KANEL Release. 

00:52:10
UNKNOWN Yes, yes Better. 

00:52:10
KRISTI KANEL Okay. So you found that helpful? 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:52:15
KRISTI KANEL What specifically can you think of that was the most helpful for you? 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN  Being able to talk about how I was feeling my anger, you know, and how other people was treating me and you confirming that everything I was doing was the way I should feel and do when I', going to grief, it really helped me. 

00:52:35
KRISTI KANEL Thank you. I'm so glad. First of all, I'm really glad. And from your perspective as watching this what would you comment of what she just said and anything further you can add about that. 

00:52:45
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ  Well, first of all, thank you for letting me be here and be with both of you. And you know, I did notice that the acceptance, the feeling that you're being validated by therapist by Dr. Kanel was really important to you? 

00:53:00
UNKNOWN Yes, yes it was. 

00:53:05
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ And you did a wonderful job just sitting and being present with all your feelings and I noticed how well she was tracking where you are at with her minimal encouragers, with her behavior and her genuineness today. So that's what really struck out to me is that she was able to capture the real feelings where you're at right now, because of that attention and that genuineness. 

00:53:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:53:25
KRISTI KANEL And so Tiffany as you watch this, what did you particularly notice about the ABC model as that was being demonstrated here. Can you describe what you observed watching this? 

00:53:35
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Absolutely. So the ABC model was playing out in a natural therapy session. I noticed first that she was following with her attending behaviors that you guys were establishing rapport with one another and as you became more comfortable with Dr. Kanel, more of your real thoughts and sources of where they came from the meanings started to come out. But as for the A part of the model, she was following you with minimal encouragers, she was exploring with open-ended questions about what was going on for you which are listed for us what the precipitating event was and really what brought you in now relating to the loss of your sister recently in February. 

00:54:15
KRISTI KANEL And what would you say was the precipitating event? 

00:54:20
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Well, attending your church service recently and missing going through those things with your sister and how that you enjoyed the empowerment on hearing the empowerment of others in the speaking and missing her, I think was the precipitating event today. 

00:54:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:54:35
KRISTI KANEL And what did you notice in terms of cognitive exploration and then the -- the corresponding kind of therapeutic interaction statements? Would you pick upon any of those, Tiffany? 

00:54:45
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ  In regards to exploring more of why it meant so much in the loss. In particular, what I noticed was that that you're feeling strongly that you're feeling powerless about the way things played out with the loss of your sister. I also noticed the importance of being triggered going to that church service and how that brought back all of these feelings for you. 

00:55:15
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. 

00:55:20
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Third piece to that was something else came up, something came up was very important. It was that you had previous losses so significant losing your son. 

00:55:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:55:25
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ  And I really appreciate it seeing that as you shared Dr. Kanel was able to carry both the compound loss that was -- had gone on for you and relate back to you that you are being triggered not only because of this recent loss, but remembering those same feelings with your son. 

00:55:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:55:45
KRISTI KANEL Yeah, in your experience and working with loss, have you noticed that to be the case that several losses can be -- you can have a resurgence of those feelings after a loss, another loss will be -- have to be re-grieved in a sense? 

00:56:00
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Yes we definitely see a lot of complex grief and we call it complex, because people may have lost someone years and years ago and then they are re-experiencing, re-living some of that initial pain in their new pain and we saw that today. 

00:56:15
KRISTI KANEL You know, as you were observing, did you pick up on any specific comments on my part towards her that you found that might have been useful or helpful in helping her get that feeling of relief other than basic attending skills and the verbal following and that kind of thing? 

00:56:30
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ I think it was very helpful and I noticed your response showed that you took it in when she was talking more about the spirit of your sister and the spirit of your son and how that was significant to you. And also how you recognized that her loss and her grief experience was so unique to her that other people may not be relating to where she was at and that was part of maybe why the grief was so hard for you and there was anger. So there was more meaning and I noticed you can continue to explore the meaning together. 

00:57:05
KRISTI KANEL And that was really important because that's you, and as a counselor I want to get into your internal world and work with that rather than just throwing a bunch of stuff at you, but really understanding from your inner world, so thank you, that was something. And as far as the coping aspect of it, what did you -- what's your comments about the coping section there? 

00:57:25
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Well I enjoyed seeing how we went to coping today with both of you. What I really liked is that Dr. Kanel asked first, what have you tried, what are you already doing and also not just moving into giving you suggestions, but seeing what you like to do. And you went just talking about journaling, I thought that was very interesting, a lot more came up in that, a lot to maybe be explored in the future which she mentioned during counseling and exploring that anger towards people. However, she also offered some good knowledge about what could be effective when you moved into talking about possibly putting together script to continue that conversation and continue your healing. You guys very much exhausted many options and your exploration of coping skills from everything to walking, again back to writing, there's little sources of support to the possibility of a grief group and to the good things you're already doing such as listening to the radio, continuing with your church family and support there, I really liked that. 

00:58:30
KRISTI KANEL Okay. Is there anything more you'd like to say before we end today's, this debrief session? 

00:58:35
UNKNOWN Yes. Thank you. 

00:58:35
KRISTI KANEL Thank you. 

00:58:35
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ  Thank you very much. 

00:58:40
KRISTI KANEL And thank you well so much. 

00:58:40
TIFFANY ATALLA HERNANDEZ Thank you.
