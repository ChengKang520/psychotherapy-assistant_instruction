THERAPY Talks 

00:01:35
DR. KATHERINE HELM About 10 years ago, a colleague and I did co-couples therapy with an African American couple. They were about 28 years old, they were engaged, deeply in love, but seriously troubled. I was seeing the male in individual therapy, and my colleague was seeing the female. Both of them had come from very, very troubled backgrounds. My client was born to a mother who was 14-years-old. His mother was deeply ashamed of him, and when she later got married, she shunned him and encouraged his siblings to do the same thing. The female member of the couple came from a similar background. She was abused physically by her stepfather, emotionally by her mother, and this caused her great distress. 

00:02:30
Katherine Helm Ph.D. 

00:02:30
DR. KATHERINE HELM One of the things that I began working on with the male in individual therapy was his tendency to cheat on his beloved partner. This couple loved each other deeply, but they just couldn't seem to make it work. 

00:02:45
Threats to Intimacy in African American Couples Katherine M. Helm Ph.D. 

00:02:45
DR. KATHERINE HELM They had an on again, off again, relationship of about 5 years, and although they were engaged, getting married was gonna be an issue for them. They also had an infant son they were successfully co-parenting. So we began working on some of my client's deeper struggles. So I would see him in individual therapy, and then we would get together for couples therapy about once a month. We've looked at the triggers to his cheating, and he cheated on her when he felt insecure, misunderstood, rejected, and lonely. And she would beg him, "Please, will you please tell me how you're feeling, what are you thinking? I'm your friend, I'm your partner." So, after about a year of therapy, we were able to do just that. We rehearsed, we role played, we worked on how he was gonna tell her when she hurt him. This is what she had been asking for, this is what he'd been wanting to do. So, the day came, and he told her. And I was excited for him. And he came in and he said, "Well, I told her." And I said, "Okay, well, what happened?" He told me her response. And I was stunned. He told her it hurts me when you do this, or when you say this. And do you know what she said? She said "You need to be the man in this relationship and let me be the woman." Wow. Within 6 weeks, they had broken up. Within 3 months, they were engaged in a very nasty custody battle over their son. What happened to this couple? They were very much in love, they were working on their issues in therapy, and yet they just couldn't make it work. 67 percent of African American marriages end in divorce. African Americans are the least likely to get married, and the least likely to stay married. What's happening here? I look to threats to intimacy that are specific to African American couples for the explanation. 

00:05:05
Components of Intimacy Sternberg Closeness Connectedness Bondedness 

00:05:05
DR. KATHERINE HELM Sternberg defines intimacy as closeness, bondedness, interdependedness, emotional relatedness. Is this what the couple was missing? I believe that intimacy is the glue that holds the relationship together. And intimacy cannot live where there is no trust. 

00:05:25
Components of Intimacy Need to help couples identify their specific threats to intimacy Historical Political Social Economic Psychological 

00:05:25
DR. KATHERINE HELM So let's look at some specific threats to African American Intimacy, and colitiants (ph) should be aware that these threats to intimacy have particular historical, political, social, economic, and deeply psychological consequences. Some of these begin with the legacy of slavery. I liken the legacy of slavery in the United States to these sort of invisible dust particles that we all breathe in, in which we're completely unaware, and yet it focuses our perspective, and it has forever shaped race relations in the United States. In some ways it's positioned, almost permanently, African Americans as "problem people". We see negative media images of African Americans, and one of the most negative things that can happen is that these images are then internalized by African American couples themselves, and then sometimes they inadvertently treat one another negatively based on these differences. So what are the specific threats to iminacy, intimacy of African American couples? 

00:06:25
Threats to Intimacy - Egalitarianism (Gender Role Flexibility) - Gender Stereotypes - Unbalanced Sex Ratio - Internalized Racism - Extended Family 

00:06:25
DR. KATHERINE HELM The first is egalitarianism, or gender role flexibility, which may not seem like a threat. It's actually a strength of African American couples. During slave times, African Americans w-, men and women, worked side by side together, and this continued long after slavery, because two incomes were required to support the children and the family. This can be a problem in the modern day world, though, if the couple has a more traditional focus, and they want the man to be, in at least heterosexual couples, anyway, the primary breadwinner, and they want the woman to be the stay at home mom. So, gender egalitarianism, although it can be a strength, can also be a threat to intimacy. Let's look at gender stereotypes. This is especially problematic. African American men, in society, are often depicted as unmotivated, criminals, threats, unable or unwilling to commit to long-term relationships, and hypersexual. African American women are frequently depicted as aggressive, domineering, emasculating, and unfeminine. It's bad enough to get these images in society, but one of the things that happens is they can get passed down through our families. And when you hear your mom, for example, say, "Black men don't raise children," or, "Black men are problematic." Let's say you have a single mom raising her single African American son, what is he then to think about himself? And how does this position him in his future romantic relationships? Other threats include the unbalanced sex ratio. 

00:08:00
Threats to Intimacy - Egalitarianism (Gender Role Flexibility) - Gender Stereotypes - Unbalanced Sex Ratio - Internalized Racism - Extended Family 

00:08:00
DR. KATHERINE HELM There's a hundred African American women to every 92 African American men, and not all of those men are considered marriageable by man-, by some standards. This presents a problem, because it often changes the rules in relationships if African American men are considered prized commodities. Internalized racism is one of the biggest threats to intimacy. These negative images, stereotypes, get internalized, and then the couple frequently, unconsciously, treat one another differently based on these stereotypes. 

00:08:35
Threats to Intimacy - Egalitarianism (Gender Role Flexibility) - Gender Stereotypes - Unbalanced Sex Ratio - Internalized Racism - Extended Family 

00:08:35
DR. KATHERINE HELM Another specific threat to intimacy, for African Americans, is the extended family, which is also a strength. African Americans have both a collective identity, in other words, a group identity, and also an individual identity. Sometimes, the extended family can be a source of great support. But, sometimes, if they don't support the primary relationship, this can be problematic. Sometimes one member of the couple questions the other's loyalty, and sometimes if the extended family needs financial support, and the couple is unable to give it, this can be problematic and cause strain. 

00:09:10
Katherine Helm Ph.D. 

00:09:10
DR. KATHERINE HELM Other threats to intimacy include, constructions of Black sexuality. As I said before, African American men and women are frequently depicted as being hypersexual, and mistrust. 

00:09:20
Threats to Intimacy - Constructions of Black sexuality - Mistrust - Technology - Socioeconomic issues 

00:09:25
DR. KATHERINE HELM Which is the largest threat to intimacy. The mythical figure, Cupid, said, "Love cannot live where there is no trust," and this is true. Remember, I said earlier that intimacy is the glue that holds the relationship together. African American couples, when surveyed, say that they trust less in their relationships, are less satisfied, and experience less happiness. This is a problem. The next threat is technology, and although this is not specific to African Americans, I cannot tell you the number of couples I have that have come into my office with their cell phones attached to their hands to show me their fights over texts or Facebook. So, good clinicians need to look at assessing th-, the role technology plays in the couple's life. And lastly, socioeconomic issues. Not individually, but as a group, African American couples typical tend to struggle more financially, and we know that financial issues can lead to serious problems in the relationship. Now, some special groups we need to consider, that have additional threats to intimacy. 

00:10:30
Culturally Sensitive Assessment - Interpreting resistance & cultural mistrust - Joining - Honesty, genuineness, empathy, & self-disclosure - Cultural awareness & knowledge - Modifying treatment approaches - Specific culturally sensitive considerations for non-Black counselors 

00:10:30
DR. KATHERINE HELM African American gay and lesbian couples, inter-cultural couples, and step parenting and multi-partnered fertility. African American gay and lesbian couples inherit a whole new set of threats to intimacy. For example, if you have one member of the couple who is more out than the other, maybe out to his or her family, and not the other person, this can cause significant strain, because 78 percent of African Americans su-, state that they are either spiritual or religious. If they belong to a church or mosque community, and their religious community doesn't support them, this can also be another problematic. Now I, myself, am in an inter-cultural marriage. I'm African American, and my husband is Black British, and although we frequently agree on issues of race, we have been surprised at the number of inter-cultural conflicts that have come up, simply because my view was shaped by being born and raised in the United States, and his view is significantly shaped by being born and raised in Britain. So, if you're working with inter-cultural African descent couples, for example, someone who might be of Haitian descent and African American. Or maybe Nigerian descent, there can be additional threats to intimacy that have to be explored. And then the last consideration would look at step parenting and multi-partner fertility. African Americans have never followed a traditional family structure, at least based on a White norm. So, blended families have been frequently common, and there may be children living in a household with multiple parents who may or may not live with them. So, clinicians need to be aware that sometimes these couples have additional struggles. Jealousy over is the former partner still interested in them. How to raise the children, as well as financial issues and the distribution of scarce resources. 

00:12:15
Culturally Sensitive Assessment - Interpreting resistance & cultural mistrust - Joining - Honesty, genuineness, empathy, & self-disclosure - Cultural awareness & knowledge - Modifying treatment approaches - Specific culturally sensitive considerations for non-Black counselors 

00:12:15
DR. KATHERINE HELM So, let's look back to our, our couple. I often wonder if I had known about the specific threats to intimacy in African American couples, would I have been ab-, able to be more effective in my work with them? I don't know if they would have stayed together, but would my understanding of the threats be empowering for them, so that I knew the factors and the dynamics operating outside of their relationship. I wanna leave you with this today. I hope that you understand these threats, and can use them and identify when they're operating in the couples that you see. 

00:12:50
Threats to Intimacy - Internalized influences - Socioeconomic class differences - Specific ways to identify threats to intimacy include 

00:12:50
DR. KATHERINE HELM I really believe that identifying them and letting the couples know, because most of them don't know that these are operating, can empower the couple and help them come up with particular strategies for dealing with them.

00:13:15
DR. SHANNON DERMER Dr. Helm, thank you. Appreciate, do you prefer Dr. Helm? Or Katherine? 

00:13:20
DR. KATHERINE HELM Whatever you like. 

00:13:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER Then I'll use both. 

00:13:20
DR. KATHERINE HELM Okay. 

00:13:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER Uh, I wanted to start off our conversation by really, um, asking a question related to your case example that you used in the beginning. 

00:13:30
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Sure, sure. 

00:13:30
Shannon Dermer Ph.D. 

00:13:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER Uh, cuz I think that is a bit of a Catch 22 you're talking about, the gender roles, especially for African American couples. 

00:13:35
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Mmhm. 

00:13:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER Um, in that, for African American couples, you had mentioned that some role flexibility is one of the strengths of African American couples. 

00:13:45
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Yes. 

00:13:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER Yet, there also seems to be a big pressure, especially when under stress, like you were talking about, it's like, "be a man," "be a woman," "let me be a man," "let me be a woman." 

00:13:55
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Mmhm. 

00:13:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER Can you say a little bit more about how you deal with some of those gender issues. 

00:14:00
DR. KATHERINE HELM Sure, um, I think that's a, a really good question, because this couple seemed to have both operating. 

00:14:05
Katherine Helm Ph.D. 

00:14:05
DR. KATHERINE HELM I mean, they were both very active in raising their infant son. Um, he constantly, sort of, had his son with him, you know, and he never had a problem changing diapers. I mean, he really considered it, you know, his, his, sort of, major goal in life was to be a good father to his son. But, he also, in some ways, had a macho complex. I mean, he was proud to be an Army recruiter, and he, he really engaged in, sort of, all the hall-, hallmarks of masculinity that one could. He worked out 7 days a week, it was really important for him to appear manly, which is why the breakthrough in therapy, for him to tell his partner that she hurt him, was so huge. So, I think this couple was dealing with both. Uh, as I think many African American and other couples do. "Tell me how you're feeling," but when a man, especially, tells a woman that he's vulnerable, he often gets judged for it, which is why he never wants to do it in the first place. So, I really think that they really struggled with that. Um, after, unfortunately, they broke up so quickly after he did tell her he was hurting that we never got a chance to, kind of, go back and process that, because quickly after that he dropped out of therapy. 

00:15:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER Well, yeah, you can, I mean, you can kind of understand why. That was, you h-, all had worked so hard. 

00:15:15
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Mmhm. 

00:15:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER To get him to that place, and there're different things that make different people vulnerable. 

00:15:20
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Yes. 

00:15:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER And it sounds like, for him, from all of that information you just gave, that that was completely vulnerable, making himself completely vulnerable, and as he was vulnerable, she, for whatever reason, took that shot, and then he just closed right back down. 

00:15:35
DR. KATHERINE HELM He absolutely did. And it was, it was sad to see, because, you know, sitting with them you could tell how much they loved each other, and they really wanted to make it work. They both recognized that a lot of their issues from their family backgrounds really, really interfered with them having a healthy relationship, and they were actively working on it. But, unfortunately, they just couldn't make it work. 

00:15:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER Well, it's too bad you didn't have time with them to work through that, but it was a excellent example of some of the gender issues, and, and I might come back to that. 

00:16:00
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Sure. 

00:16:05
DR. SHANNON DERMER But there, there is another thing I wanna ask you, especially, I think, a lot of African Americans, sometimes, say this, and I think that, um, probably White America struggles with this a little bit more. Um, and it's the idea of the legacy of slavery. 

00:16:15
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Mmhm. 

00:16:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER Now, I know, with, uh, my training in systems, uh, counseling and therapy and marriage and family counseling and therapy, how long things can affect, uh, people. 

00:16:25
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Mmhm. 

00:16:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER (crosstalk)Over generations. 

00:16:30
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Mmhm. 

00:16:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER But what do you say to the couple that says, "what are you talking about, the legacy of slavery? That was over 100 years ago." 

00:16:35
DR. KATHERINE HELM Yes, uh, almost over 150 years ago, in fact. Um, you know, I think that's a, a really good, uh, question. Because I think that we don't always have to use the word legacy of slavery with couples, but instead we can look at how, um, racism, and, you know, acts of discrimination impact there lives, as well as, sort of, looking at their own internalized stereotypes. So, I say legacy of slavery so that we have a historical context, so when I, you know, talk about the contextual factors that a lot of African American couples contend with, we're understanding where they come from, and that would be the legacy of slavery. Um, I don't often, even with my own African American couples, say the legacy of slavery, but I do kind of assess how some of these other factors are operating. 

00:17:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER Okay, so it may not be a term that you use with your clients. 

00:17:25
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Mmhm. 

00:17:25
Shannon Dermer Ph.D. 

00:17:25
DR. SHANNON DERMER But you want all of the clinicians who are watching today to understand that's where some of those things originated. 

00:17:30
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Exactly. 

00:17:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER That some of the things that, um, about family structure did not come from Africa, come over, they were created here by a lot of the oppression, and violence, and rights being taken away, and then, uh, couples have had to deal with that legacy over time, and I think that it's also important to remember that it's not that long ago, the 60s and things like that. 

00:17:50
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Sure. 

00:17:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER I have a colleague who talks about her mother, so that's one generation back, her mother had to, um, was in the south during integration of schools. 

00:18:00
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Mmhm. Mmhm. 

00:18:00
DR. SHANNON DERMER And so, she's a professional, she's educated, she's been exposed to a lot of different people, but she grew up with the message all the time of, "you can't trust," you know? 

00:18:10
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Sure. 

00:18:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER That you can't trust a man to take care of you. 

00:18:15
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Sure. 

00:18:15
DR. SHANNON DERMER You know, you can't trust white people, in some ways, to take care of you. So, I think it's easy to forget that those messages were overt, and that violence was overt, not that long ago. 

00:18:25
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Exactly. You know, not that long ago at all. Um, back to your comment about family structure, Africans were, are tribal by nature. 

00:18:35
Katherine Helm Ph.D. 

00:18:35
DR. KATHERINE HELM And so, the village does really raise the child. It wasn't until Africans got to the United States that that was pathologized. That the mom, dad, nuclear family structure was sort of imposed on them. Although, during slave times, when slaves were being sold, you could never really be a nuclear family. So, you know, I think that African American family structure today is not only still, in some ways, um, directly descended from the tribal cultures of Africa, but also what has been created here in the United States. 

00:19:00
DR. SHANNON DERMER Now, how open are couples to discussing some of those societal influences, versus just what goes on in their home? 

00:19:10
DR. KATHERINE HELM Um, really open. Because, I think that, I think a lot of what I see with my couples is a sense of relief. Now, I think one of the things to keep in mind is, I'm African American and I'm doing Afr-, sort of, interventions with a an African American couple, so there may be some implied safety there. But, my, kind of, saying, "look, I, how do these things impact your life?" You know, uh, are things that sometimes we think about out there, but we don't think about in here what's happening between you and I. And so, a lot of times they're relieved. Um, they can look at, sort of, direct correlations between something that happened in work, and then their attitude when they come home with their romantic partner or spouse. So, I think that a lot of times they have been unaware of how they're operating, and how specifically it, uh, deeply impacted they are by these things, in their relationship. 

00:19:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER Okay. So, uh, do you find that couples are open to talking about, not just what they do between each other. 

00:20:05
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Mmhm. 

00:20:05
DR. SHANNON DERMER But also the influence of what it's like to live in our society, now we're talking about, specifically, African American couples. 

00:20:10
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Yes. 

00:20:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER Until we get to intercultural. 

00:20:10
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Sure. 

00:20:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER But, um, that, uh, what it's like to live in our society and had to deal with some of those stresses and strains, even if they're not overtly visible, sometimes, but they're still there. 

00:20:20
DR. KATHERINE HELM Very much. 

00:20:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER You find them to be open to talking about that? 

00:20:25
DR. KATHERINE HELM Yes, this is pretty common conversation, so couples aren't surprised, and reliev-, but I think that, even though as individuals, many African Americans understand, sorta, the lives they live, what the reality is of being African American in America. What they don't realize is the negative impact it has on their relationships. 

00:20:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER So, they don't make, necessarily, er, people don't make, necessarily, the connection between how that affects them directly in their relationship. 

00:20:50
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Mmhm. 

00:20:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER And in, uh, their intimacy. 

00:20:50
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Mmhm, many do not, yes, yes. 

00:20:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER So, do you think there's a diff-, you talked about threats to intimacy in the African American couples. 

00:20:55
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Yes. 

00:21:00
DR. SHANNON DERMER Do you think that intimacy is defined the same way for all types of of couples? I mean, like, different backgrounds, cultures, or do you think that intimacy looks a little different for African American couples? 

00:21:10
DR. KATHERINE HELM Mmhm. Um, that's a good question. And I, I hesitate to speak for, in some ways, all couples, even though I guess that's what I'm doing today. Um, you know, and, I think, one thing a good clinician will do is figure out what intimacy means to each particular couple. Right? And so, for example, if you ask some couples, having your partner be your best friend is at the top of the list. That would be part of their definition of emotional intimacy. For another couple, they meant, that might not, necessarily, be the case, so, i think that you bring up a good point, it's important to kind of assess, you know, how important is, ha-, does this couple, uh, believe emotional intimacy is. You know? And, what components consist for them. 

00:21:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER Okay. So, you go in with a general knowledge of African Americans, but always with the idea of, I have to assess specifically. 

00:21:55
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Always, always. 

00:22:00
DR. SHANNON DERMER What is important to them. 

00:22:00
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Absolutely, yes. 

00:22:00
DR. SHANNON DERMER Um, but with the, the general knowledge and the background of things to assess and maybe things to talk about. 

00:22:05
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Yes, yes. I, I never, sort of, come from an expert point of view, you know? In some ways, I'm, I'm very pleased to be here, um, but I don't consider myself an expert. I'm more, sort of, um, a, a student who has a, a area of knowledge that I continue to be interested in. 

00:22:20
Katherine Helm Ph.D. 

00:22:20
DR. KATHERINE HELM And I think, in some ways, that's what I bring to my clients, you know? This, this area, these ideas, these threats to intimacy, and share them with them and ask them how they're operating in their lives without assuming that they automatically do. 

00:22:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER Okay. Um, one of the statistics that you mentioned in the beginning. 

00:22:35
DR. KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:22:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER Um, and it's assuming, well, actually, it's not assuming, I know the statistic is that a lot of African American women, especially, still want to get married. 

00:22:45
Shannon Dermer Ph.D. 

00:22:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER Um, but yet, you see less African Americans getting married and more divorce. 

00:22:50
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Yes. 

00:22:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER Um, so it's not that, um, excuse me, marriage isn't valued anymore, marriage is still very much valued, but you see the decline in rate of marriage, and the increase in divorce rate. 

00:23:00
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Yes. 

00:23:05
DR. SHANNON DERMER What do you attribute some of that to? 

00:23:05
DR. KATHERINE HELM Um, you know, African Americans, when polled, say they mar-, they rate marriage very, very highly. Um, marriage as a whole, in our society, is on the decline. Fewer and fewer couples are actually getting married, more people are cohabitating, and the family structures, in the United States as a whole, continue to change. Um, you know, overall, many heterosexual African American women say they prefer African American men as partners. There tends to be less interracial dating on the part of African American women as a whole than on the part of African American men. I really think that the unbalanced sex ratio contributes. I think some of the discrepancies in the criminal justice system also contribute. And so, I think that, you know, these are some of the reasons why marriage is on the decline. And I also think that, you know, in some ways, in today's world, it may be harder to get married, stay married, many children are, uh, children of divorced families, you know, and so, they also may be, sort of, marriage wary, or scared to even get married. 

00:24:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER So, you're saying it's a, again, a general phenomenon in, in our society, in the United States in general. 

00:24:15
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Yes. 

00:24:15
DR. SHANNON DERMER Uh, but then you see, it a, a little bit more the African American culture. 

00:24:20
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Yes, yeah, and, you know, just, uh, a funny story, um, when my husband and I were dating, um, you know, he said, you know, in, in Britain we don't get married as much. And I thought no, you're just saying this because, you know- 

00:24:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER He's playing ya. 

00:24:30
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)You're just, yeah, you're just saying this. Um, and then, in, in doing the book I actually looked up statistics and, uh, marriage rates in Europe are significantly down, and the United States, although we mar-, we value marriage very highly as a society, uh, seem to be following that trend. African Americans seem just to have done it first. 

00:24:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER Oh, trendsetters. 

00:24:50
DR. KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:24:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER Uh, I'm glad you brought up your husband. Um, because you mentioned inter-cultural. 

00:24:55
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Yes. 

00:24:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER And I think a lot of times, when people hear inter-cultural they think, "oh, um, caucasian and African American." 

00:25:05
DR. KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:25:05
DR. SHANNON DERMER Or, um, other groups like that. But you're actually talking about that you and your husband would be what some people call "Black". 

00:25:10
DR. KATHERINE HELM That's right. 

00:25:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER (crosstalk)But he is, um, Black British, is that what you said? 

00:25:15
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)He's Black British, yes. 

00:25:15
DR. SHANNON DERMER Okay. And you're African American. 

00:25:15
DR. KATHERINE HELM That's right. 

00:25:15
DR. SHANNON DERMER So, what's, um, what do you see, you talked a little bit about it, but what do you see the biggest things that clinicians need to assess with inter-cultural couples, even if they're both considered Black. 

00:25:25
DR. KATHERINE HELM Yes. I think, um, a lot of times we proceed as if we know something or we're correct about something because it's the way it's always been done. And, you know, you know, if you come from a particular cultural background, you're sort of encapsulated in your own cultural point of view. 

00:25:45
Katherine Helm Ph.D. 

00:25:45
DR. KATHERINE HELM And it's not until you have somebody come from a different place that says, "wait a minute," you know, "we don't do it that way." You know, where you think, well, it's always been done this way, it must be the right way. So, I think a lot of times one of the things that we looked at, um, in our book was how inter-cultural couples deal with things like child raising practices, and even ideas about marriage, and, you know, just kind of cultural norms that are taken for granted that are not norms at all in other particular cultures. And it, it was interesting because I sort of am living that, I thought, "Wow." I was reading and I thought, "Oh, wow, interesting, very enlightening, thanks." 

00:26:20
Shannon Dermer Ph.D. 

00:26:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER I've definitely found the best way to learn about our own culture is to travel and see other cultures, or have friends or partners from other cultures. Cuz you're right, we do take it for granted, "well, this is just the way it is." 

00:26:30
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Mmhm. Mmhm. 

00:26:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER And then you see that a lot of people do it differently. 

00:26:35
DR. KATHERINE HELM Exactly. 

00:26:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER Um. I know some of the research on inter-cultural couples actually says that even though there can be a lot of problems with child raising and things like that, because you have different ideas, that also if you could work through it- 

00:26:45
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Mmhm. 

00:26:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER Actually, it can be more intimate than couples who are more alike, because you discuss things that other people just think, "Oh, we, we think the same on that. 

00:26:55
DR. KATHERINE HELM Mmhm. I, you know, I think that might be true if, if couples, one, are aware. And two, if they're actually willing to have the discussions. Um, one of the, you know, um, Dr. Shantay Deloshe (ph) actually authored the chapter, one of things that she found was, sometimes couples aren't even willing to have a conversation. Or, sometimes, the other couple sort of, you know, um, dampens their own cultural beliefs and just kind of goes with the other person's cultural beliefs. Um, so, I think some of that depends. I think that it can be an increased, um, intimacy connection if the couple is willing to have the conversation. And they even recognize that it's operating in the first place. 

00:27:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER Right, so, for, uh, clinicians, that would be something they should encourage as a way to increase intimacy and understanding and, um, their couple functioning. 

00:27:40
DR. KATHERINE HELM Exactly. 

00:27:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER Now, we only have a couple minutes left. I just wanted you to say something real quickly about another group that you mentioned, which was gay and lesbian, or same sex couples. 

00:27:50
DR. KATHERINE HELM Mmhm. 

00:27:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER Um, in the African American community. Um, what do you think adds a special layer for those couples within the African American community? 

00:27:55
DR. KATHERINE HELM Mmhm. Um, I think that, you know, sometimes the African American community, um, I think it's changing, but has not always embraced gays and lesbians, similar to the greater population. Um, and I think that because 78 percent of African Americans report very high levels of spirituality and religiosity, um, I think that sometimes very religious communities still have a problem with their gay or lesbian members. And so, I think that you inherit a whole other set, the more oppressed groups you sort of belong to in society, the more threats to intimacy may be operating in your relationship. And so, because, you know, a gay and lesbian couple may belong to a church community that doesn't support them, they may not be flexible enough to be out, you know, they may have to hide their relationship, this can be a painful issue for these couples. 

00:28:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER So, it's really about multiple layers of- 

00:28:45
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)I believe so. 

00:28:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER Uh, what some people might call micro aggressions, oppressions- 

00:28:50
DR. KATHERINE HELM (crosstalk)Exactly. Mmhm. 

00:28:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER (crosstalk)Stereotypes. That they're dealing with multiple levels in addition to the same things that every African American couple is. 

00:28:55
DR. KATHERINE HELM Yes. 

00:28:55
