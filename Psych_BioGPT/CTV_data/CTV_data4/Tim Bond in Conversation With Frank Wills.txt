00:00:50
FRANK WILLS My name is Frank Wills at the University of Wales in Newport. I'm delighted today to be able to welcome Tim Bond from the University of Bristol and former chair of the British Association for Counseling and Psychotherapy. Tim has come to be interviewed in our series of key figures, who have contributed to the developments of counseling and psychotherapy in Britain. Tim is of course a very well known for this contribution to the development of standards and ethics in British counseling. But there is a lot more to Tim than that and we will be exploring his ideas how they developed and which way he thinks the developing in, in the future. Okay then so let's now look at the video. Tim welcome to Newport. It's very nice to see you here. I thought I would begin if I may just by asking you really how you became a counselor and being a counselor of myself of course I'm interested in the early influences as well. So can you tell me a little bit about whether there was a Tim Bond counselor and ethics person in the making in your earlier days. 

00:02:05
TIM BOND Not in anyway that was in my awareness, although looking back on it I can see the various forces that took me in that direction rather than other directions. And but you probably I think like a lot of people in my 20's I was struggling with the end of relationship and my identity and things and sorts of counseling for myself and found out extremely helpful. I thought no more about it was getting almost my life. I had finished university and I was working as a social worker in a very tough red light area. But also very warmhearted community and I found that I was starting to as it were trying to offer some of the people I was working with the sort of help that I've benefited from on that some way trust grew(ph). 

00:03:05
FRANK WILLS And I noticed in the introduction to the book on Standards and Ethics that you do pay tribute to your mother and father you know. 

00:03:10
TIM BOND Yes. 

00:03:15
FRANK WILLS You know make reference to the kind of ethical life. 

00:03:15
TIM BOND Umm… umm… 

00:03:20
FRANK WILLS Um… was there anything there you think which might have… 

00:03:20
TIM BOND Well… yes I mean there was both beneficial and problematic in some ways. My father is a man who he would say about his own life his tragedy as he would think that there is any one way of doing things and say he has a very clear views about what is right and wrong. So some of my early history was very much struggling to find my own place in that and taking sometimes quite different views from what he would consider right or wrong. My mother is more attentive to listening in lots of ways so that's, that's also perhaps predisposed me taught some more counseling way of problem solving. And whilst I had… had engaged with theology for while and became I think consistently over the years become less and less interested in any sort of doctrinaire away of approaching life and people. And much more interested in trying to understand what it is that matters to people and then what the implications are for forming a relationship with our person whether it is therapeutic or personal relationship. 

00:04:40
FRANK WILLS That is interesting actually because you know I, I had a strong sense you know reading your work and then seeing how that written work was represented in that you know the, the organizational work that you did for, for BACP that. You know, you've always been very interested in different ways of seeing things and different value positions and quite interested in supply of between them and… and in a way looking at things from in other points of views. 

00:05:10
TIM BOND I would like certainly see different waves in focuses of interest flag through my work. So when I was first involved with BACP, they had a very inspirational, very shorter statement of ethics which was really quite a robust protest against the paternalism that was typical with many of professional standards of professionals assuming you're better than their clients. And I think quite strongly picking up on those ideas that come from the humanist tradition of valuing the results as people carry within them and to their experience and the meaning they can make from that. And but even then although BACP then was then had, I don't know everything hasn't been there something in that sort of order very small everybody knew everybody… 

00:06:00
FRANK WILLS …to quickly mid 80's 

00:06:05
TIM BOND …mid 80's yeah. Umm… you can start to see it already we were going to need more structure than that size and participated in the phase of trying to take into account what implications of the law would be for an emerging profession. Trying to keep the spirit of this respect for individual identity and autonomy. And at the same time I started to grapple with how do we manage that of the context of professional conduct so to deciding what the, what the limits are. What are the after limits and what is acceptable within a professional group. So I had phase of going through that which I didn't find very comfortable. I found that was a struggle. 

00:06:55
FRANK WILLS And this was virgin territory. 

00:06:55
TIM BOND Very much same, I think… 

00:07:00
FRANK WILLS Nothing in, in base really that was the 84 code as you've said. 

00:07:05
TIM BOND Yeah, yeah but we were starting to realize that, that those within the membership and sometimes attracting people who possibly rise or exclude from other professional groups or were using the sort of very emphatic traditions of counseling as a way of getting access to very vulnerable people to exploit financially or sexually. They were a minority, very, very few people with each region probably had one or two people or that type of some of them are some infamy and how would we grapple with that. We engage with it quite reluctantly initially. 

00:07:45
FRANK WILLS I'm interested in the term infamy because infamous behavior does a care in a code doesn't, I don't if it still in the very latest form… 

00:07:55
TIM BOND I don't think it is now I think it's full. Well I think probably that time where you even several of us who would might use term like that if you might expect the most counselors were quite discrete you know conversations about people where we probably each of us have some on the… 

00:08:10
FRANK WILLS …no, no it was not patriotic… 

00:08:10
TIM BOND Yeah. 

00:08:15
FRANK WILLS And just before we, we concentrate more on the, on the ethical side can I just talk about some other things that were happening to you just prior to that really. You, you studied theology you have told me. 

00:08:25
TIM BOND Yeah. 

00:08:30
FRANK WILLS And you also took a lower exams. So I'm wondering did you feel that those two influences played any role in your thinking tool. 

00:08:40
TIM BOND Undoubtedly, I mean the thing that I took from theology with I think prior to two things out with one was that certainly the philosophical side of theology is very interesting and it really introduces you to whole systems of thought. But also in a way the big message I took from this impermanence of such systems that, that they, they are human creations and they change overtime and they are all contested. 

00:09:15
FRANK WILLS Hmm… Hmm… 

00:09:15
TIM BOND In terms of law I'm not sure the laws ever particularly excited me as a subject. But my process of engagement with its, I've seen it as a tool to be used rather than something that's sort of inspired my creativity. It is a sort of public morality its a shared point of reference in any society or that the law varies enormously from within different societies and even within these islands. So I've always been interested in that point of view. 

00:10:00
FRANK WILLS And is it, is it a that kind of useful way of thinking as well I was interested in the way you're saying about you know first of all establish the parameters and the extremes of the phenomenon you are looking at. Is that possibly you are thinking of may be. 

00:10:20
TIM BOND I hesitate to say, but I think it is a useful way of thinking. I think law certainly written in the English tradition particularly within the common law tradition. It tends to encourage a sort of literalism and an obsession with exact phrases and exact meanings of word, words which I'm in the end starting to think off as probably perhaps the inevitable way of running any legal system. But not necessarily thinking that actually relates to ethics very much that it's it is about how to administer a system and how to reach decision. So I was always much more interested in the equitable law and the old star chamber which was far more driven by ethical concerns. And within that system which was ultimately amalgamated in common law in 1875 I think. The way you much more concerned with what is good, what is fair and that style of thinking which I think sadly as requisition(ph) died with Lord Denning is much less evident in law as practiced now. It's not totally absent but it's not a stronger voice that it used to be. 

00:11:45
FRANK WILLS It remains me actually that a comment that Douglas Hooper makes in the introduction to your Standards and Ethics book where he says that perhaps one of the real the art of Standards and Ethics if you like is getting the balance between the detail that, that fine detail of a situation but also you know making more around it kind of judgment. 

00:12:05
TIM BOND Hmm… Hmm… 

00:12:10
FRANK WILLS And it seems to me there has been that in supply within the… 

00:12:15
TIM BOND I think I certainly think it is us over the last 20 or 30 years that I have been interested in ethics. I think I've become much more concerned with these general questions about what is fair, what is good. Then perhaps when I set out I think may be I was still 100% my father and me I think, I think may be I sought for this, some very clear answers to be found I no longer looking for this. 

00:12:35
FRANK WILLS And in the way perhaps what you've done as you, you, you've used them the signpost of the way you see the in this slow going, there is, the sign to go the other way. 

00:12:50
TIM BOND Well that would been carried up. 

00:12:50
FRANK WILLS …you don't drive their own way. 

00:12:55
TIM BOND I don't, I don't walk with the crowd easily. 

00:12:55
FRANK WILLS I see. So I mean and the other thing that would be happening around immediately prior to your BACP work was that you've obviously established yourself as a counselor. And I think you work in students counseling am I right. 

00:13:10
TIM BOND Yes I mean I have to fairly what nowadays probably would be an unusual, unorthodox introduction to counseling was the I was working in this community in the northeast in urban area where I was working both as an authorized mental welfare officer and as a social worker. And I was always more interested in the therapeutic side and so I was attached to various established therapists including what was Claremont House, the Regional Psychotherapy Center for combination of sort of apprenticeship type training where I sat in a room, people at work and I sat and observed me doing the same sort of work, attended seminars and all sorts of things. So it's very much an individualized training which will be very different from the way most of people would get the training that for more cause. But I have learnt in surround(ph) format and it get reinvigorated to my enthusiasm for learning which I had lost really through my struggles with theology and so. And the so from there I then went to carried on being a social worker working and moved more and more into addiction work, running groups in to my first level was group therapy rather than one to one work. Eventually one way or another ended up teaching in a college for further and higher education which also recruited young people from the area as I had been a social worker and some of the many way. And to my surprise I saw members of families I had never seen as a social worker. And there had been brothers or sisters that are never been in trouble with the law never come to our attention with addiction problems or difficulties at school. And was very impressed with the way in which from home where there is a sort of level of poverty was very obvious and deprivation with sort of homes that you know if you stand up, you get bitten by the dog. If you sit down you get bitten by flies and you stick to the carpet. And yet in my college environment they were holding their own. And I saw the potential of education, saw them taking the opportunity, taking education as a ladder out of some very difficult home circumstances and started to offer some counseling for some of them and out of that group counseling services, student counseling service. 

00:15:50
FRANK WILLS I've only just realized this right now actually better all, all our regions into counseling have very strong so much, I was a mental welfare officer. 

00:15:55
TIM BOND Yeah right. 

00:16:00
FRANK WILLS You've followed a quite a similar routine and I just wanted to say in not say to ask you that you know there was a certain stream of people coming from social work and… 

00:16:05
TIM BOND Very much so. 

00:16:10
FRANK WILLS …counseling and looking back on it now about myself I feel one of the reasons why probably I went that way although not necessary very consciously was the, the removal of psychological work from social work. 

00:16:25
TIM BOND Yes and that would be true for me. 

00:16:25
FRANK WILLS That's great sadness to me that because I think the social workers are often very good listeners. 

00:16:30
TIM BOND Yes I think in comparison to many of the caring profession so I think they are very good listeners. The yes I mean may had a big reason for leaving was that I felt that as the money started to flow into social work you got bureaucratic careers emerging. And instead of a surface was when I joined is very much sort of listening to a community and being part of that communities starts to become a sacred career to… and I didn't enjoy that tension and it became more and more problematic to me. 

00:17:05
FRANK WILLS Yes, yes I think that was the point when I left when, when somebody told me that we didn't think I was managerial material. Okay so, so can we move into your work with BACP now, I think I've told to you that we spent to quite a few people about the early days of, of BACP. And I just wonder can you do what you remember about the organization in those days which we're talking about you know the early mid 80's. 

00:17:35
TIM BOND Yes it was a very different from the way it is now. And it was I mean the whole spirit of the age was very different of course that I mean were by and large people would tell me, growing up in the 60's and 70's hippy-dom, I certainly was a hippy in my late teens in early 20's. Umm… so all sorts of throwing over the traces that experimentation, counseling as I saw it was such a relief both in terms of his commitments to listening to people with fresh ears. But all sentence were challenging a lot of the paternalism that was typical of many of the caring professions that time. And I literally do remember working in psychiatric outpatient and in another clinical settings and hearing people saying more seriousness to an anxious patient you know trust me I'm a doctor. 

00:18:35
FRANK WILLS And I don't know why this image came to us, kind of thinking. Yeah this is the kind of creative… 

00:18:40
TIM BOND Umm… 

00:18:40
FRANK WILLS …crowd of people quite unveiled in many way. 

00:18:40
TIM BOND Oh that's how quite anarchic in lots of ways. I think one of the things that was particularly valued at that time was the strong sense of individualism. We were all in different ways had a history very often in another professions that come out them. And you know what did it contribute towards counseling so we were people were invested quite a lot in those movements. But we were also determined to somehow maintain relationships with each other which was unusual in the professional bodies at that time. So we were all very aware off how easy it was for the different therapeutic orientations to end up an antagonism with each other. And so we structured the ways in which we work together as well we could to prevent that and it was certainly is one of the ironies of counseling and psychotherapy that how easy it is to, to set up few sense(ph) and schisms that divide the movement when lots of my as you would expect people who listen carefully to each other to be best place to avoid those sorts of difficulties. 

00:19:55
FRANK WILLS And you, yourself don't seem to identify overwhelmingly with one, one point of view and, and that itself would be congruent with other things you say about respecting values and… 

00:20:10
TIM BOND Yes I think I've always had difficulty in and maybe this was the thing which I worked out in theology for, for myself. I've always had difficulties sort of signing up to any sets of beliefs, wholeheartedly. And sort of really seriously believing that they are better than another set of beliefs. So in my individual background it was my first training was larger psychodynamic. And but actually I didn't find that spoke to me very well at that time. And so I moved across to people who are much more humanistically orientated. And then later on returned back to those original trainers as my own therapy moved on and I certainly started able to hear. It was no longer says certainly(ph) I could hear what was being said and started to appreciate it. So I have always moved between those different worlds. 

00:21:00
FRANK WILLS And you know we, we were saying that… that this was a to some degree a world of free spirits. 

00:21:10
TIM BOND Hmm… 

00:21:10
FRANK WILLS But of course you know some organizational rules are needed… 

00:21:10
TIM BOND Hmm… 

00:21:15
FRANK WILLS …especially for public work and public responsibilities and so forth and they did begin this process of which you are very much involved of developing standards and ethics of practice. And you know from 1985 to 1993, you, you sat on the Standards and Ethics Committee and you were the chair of that for some, for some period. So can you tell me little bit about how you kind of got involved with that and what that felt like you know to be the man bringing in some, some rules in a way kind of thing through this organization. 

00:22:00
TIM BOND I found it intellectually intriguing but emotionally at times quite disheartening, best way I can put it. So the I mean the intellectual excitement was not put in to think fresh how ethics might be and had been involved very much in the periphery of social work ethics before I moved across to counseling. And so I had started as, so I had a little bit of exposure to what that process might be. And, and the sense of the tension between intellectual analysis and political process producing something and then having to explain it to people and allowing people their voice and it is in the political compromises you make before a large organization with a doctor. Umm… but emotionally I felt I wish, wish we didn't needed. 

00:22:50
FRANK WILLS Hmm…Hmm… 

00:22:55
TIM BOND I would have preferred to remain the free spirit because that's what I really liked about the original statesmen from the way which we worked together. But I also recognize that we are great dangerous in just staying as we were may be that was an idyllic phase that we couldn't sustain indefinitely. And that, that was partly that we are growing in numbers so they weren't sort of personal checks and opportunities to challenge each other and question each other about what we are doing. But also the law was that already in the mid 80's were starting to impact. And there is always this concern about how you negotiate your relationship with law. And if you don't have a clear sense of identity and rationale it's a much more difficult while doing with it. And also the other thing which I was becoming apparent at that time was although they were very rare, they were small number of people who seriously exploiting and abusing their clients and bringing therefore potentially bringing all of us into disrepute. And I've always remember I can't now actually I remember how was I came to interview this particular man. But he was a man who, who was presents himself as a counselor, but at least some of the evidence we were holding centrally. there were at least something in the order of 15 to 20 alleg… separate allegations or sexual abuse. Ah… quite often begins quite young people and clearly we need to have some system for engaging with that. And we couldn't just carry on in our hippyish ways. 

00:24:50
FRANK WILLS Yes and… and the thought struck me when you were saying it you know very instant in your the emotional reservations in a way and, and this was slight pain I think you had doing that may have made you the very man do it of course. 

00:25:10
TIM BOND Maybe yes, maybe I mean I certainly think I always remember one particular person Graham Cooper challenging me and sort of thing how much you regret it we were having, we were moving in this direction because he really like the spirit. And my heart was more with him that even though my head said that we had actually reached a point where we couldn't continue for much longer in that direction. I hope to keep the spirit… 

00:25:30
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:25:35
TIM BOND …but it would have, we would have to more in place to protect that spirit. 

00:25:40
FRANK WILLS And, and that's almost anticipating my, my next helicon which really is perhaps it was that you know people sense that in you which allowed them to allow you to do it kind of thing it is what I mean 

00:25:50
TIM BOND Yes, yes. 

00:25:55
FRANK WILLS That reluctance system that would then more convincing to them that this where he did need me doing. Just I'm sure will you slightly irreverent memory I have with you at that stage was that, that, that seem to be I think probably so late 80's, early 90's conferences that seem to be you and Ervin Jameson did this kind of double act… 

00:26:15
TIM BOND Umm… 

00:26:20
FRANK WILLS …at the conference every year. 

00:26:20
TIM BOND Yes. 

00:26:20
FRANK WILLS And it usually involved signing off the process of changes and amendments to with one code of ethics followed by the proposal of a new one. 

00:26:30
TIM BOND And we have the systems of years consultation yes you got, got to tell a story. 

00:26:35
FRANK WILLS It was well I think it was a kind of… I think there were one or two people referred you as the dynamic duo… 

00:26:40
TIM BOND Right, yes. 

00:26:40
FRANK WILLS And it was it was always a quite a jovial delivery that you, you gave at the conference. 

00:26:50
TIM BOND Yes I mean that in lots of ways I mean, I think Allan must have felt the change possibly more than I did because he originally had been the architect for this very short statement which did capture the spirit of the movement as it was in 84. And he and a group of people who I don't think remained active in that way for very long. But Allan did so he was a link and was a good, and it was a very good foil to because he, he could both represent the old and the new. 

00:27:25
FRANK WILLS And slightly, slightly darker comments here I think as well if you, you indulge me on this. I, I have a sense that a lot of that work went through the conference quite easily. And you know that, that it didn't sprung great debates. There was one which will come to in a moment which did but you know there was a slight sense sometimes I think us in the membership being glad that you were there doing it kind of thing you know. But maybe not always engaging as carefully as we perhaps could have done, I mean did you ever feel like yourself? 

00:28:10
TIM BOND I think I was just thankful for those who did just exceptive I was very well aware behind the scenes there were great debates. 

00:28:15
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:28:15
TIM BOND And some debates continued over many years. 

00:28:20
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:28:20
TIM BOND …with regular correspondence. 

00:28:25
FRANK WILLS The conference wasn't particularly… very often I suppose. 

00:28:30
TIM BOND It didn't often really reflect the level of debate and turmoil that was behind the scenes. 

00:28:35
FRANK WILLS But I note did you, did you ever have that sense that, that in more way we would terribly grateful for you kind of doing this in a way because we couldn't quite be bothered to do it ourselves. 

00:28:50
TIM BOND Ah… no I never really felt this in quite that way. I was more aware of some people who really regret it if any change was taking place and would argue their case for avoiding that. And some people who had felt very passionately around various details and I think we're going to come to analyze in a moment. And then a number of people who really had access to grind they were really determined to protect their economic niche. And, and that was one of the difficulties we did get into, as codes became more specific. And it was almost inevitable that they were going to favor one professional section of counseling over another. And of course some people have livelihood or big organization to defend it's own. So now I never really felt that sort of lost of goodwill or you know leave it to you. I was more aware of maybe that side was just eclipsed by the other. 

00:30:10
FRANK WILLS And I think one of the things that was kind of running parallel with this was you know follow on from the first 84 code was the actual you know complaints procedures… 

00:30:20
TIM BOND Yeah. 

00:30:20
FRANK WILLS …which I know that you've have handed and I think you know the first properly laid out plans for those in 1992. 

00:30:30
TIM BOND Hmm… 

00:30:30
FRANK WILLS And then there was a controversy than about sexual contact between counselors and clients. 

00:30:35
TIM BOND Yes. 

00:30:40
FRANK WILLS And I really enjoyed reading your description of this in one of… yeah in the chapter in one of Wendy Drains books where you were talking about the twelve, the twelve week period when there is should be no relationship between counselor and client. 

00:30:55
TIM BOND Hmm… 

00:30:55
FRANK WILLS And then, I think a… a point there's a lot people didn't pick up the time and even longer cooling off period… 

00:31:00
TIM BOND Yes. 

00:31:00
FRANK WILLS …where that therapeutic processes has have had been longer. 

00:31:05
TIM BOND Hmm… 

00:31:05
FRANK WILLS But of course you know any sort of figure is going to be really focus peoples mind and there was quite a lot of controversy about that. 

00:31:15
TIM BOND Hmm… 

00:31:15
FRANK WILLS And in the article you know very presciently said you know that you were sure that this wouldn't last to very for long and… 

00:31:20
TIM BOND Yes. 

00:31:20
FRANK WILLS …this would be revised again, but that it was a starting point for… 

00:31:25
TIM BOND Hmm… well that always been… 

00:31:30
FRANK WILLS …more person to debate. 

00:31:30
TIM BOND It… it was a tension which I suppose preoccupied me in other areas based on relation to counseling skills where counseling skill stop where counseling starts these very blurred boundaries. But also, at what point do client and counselor meet again as adults, adult-to-adult if ever. And of course, there's the source of issues which really throw out tensions between the different orientations because if you're psychodynamically, routine psychodynamic theory, you… you're very suspicious on the possibility of ever meeting again on equal terms and those paradynamics and transpiration of relationships and the projections are very likely to possessed throughout a life time and may or may not be recovered, whereas those coming from the sort of more humanistic tradition were much more optimistic about being able to establish at the times of relationships. And that was all around at the time and this attempt in sort of saying well, maybe there's an adequate cooling off and adequate checks and safeguards are in place. There maybe… it is possible for people to move on. Uh… it was a… sort of float with political compromises and it took few goes to get the judgments right about where this compromises should fall. 

00:33:00
FRANK WILLS And… and you… you cut out comment before you know that once you give a figure people would really start to… 

00:33:05
TIM BOND Well… 

00:33:05
FRANK WILLS …focus on that figure and… 

00:33:10
TIM BOND Yes. 

00:33:10
FRANK WILLS …although they watch their watches from end of the twelve week… 

00:33:10
TIM BOND Absolutely. Its anything like sort of you know oh good three months lets go talk your tough, your thing, but they uh… it… I would must say I know I think I under estimated the extent to which people would hear time as their clouts was the primary concern because it's measurable, because everything else that you're looking at around it all the dynamics that relationship resolved with counseling committee to have you… have you tested out where your relationship has rested(ph), then much more difficult judgment, so people would latch on to the… the simplest bid of it and that loomed large. Umm… 

00:33:55
FRANK WILLS So, again it's the… the combination of the… the precise fine detail… 

00:34:00
TIM BOND Hmm… 

00:34:00
FRANK WILLS …and the more rounded judgment. 

00:34:05
TIM BOND Yeah. 

00:34:05
FRANK WILLS Bit, in a way being leaded to… 

00:34:05
TIM BOND Yeah. 

00:34:05
FRANK WILLS …come together. 

00:34:05
TIM BOND Yes. 

00:34:10
FRANK WILLS Can… some other things, some other important things were happening at this time. One, which I think we hear in Newport found very helpful and… and informed our work then since very much was that I think you were the first person who made a really clear distinction between using counseling skills and counseling. 

00:34:30
TIM BOND Hmm… 

00:34:30
FRANK WILLS And um, that was very important to us here because um, of course most people have come into training… 

00:34:40
TIM BOND Hmm… 

00:34:40
FRANK WILLS …and you know probably owned counselors and probably shouldn't be counselors at that stage much more like to be using counseling skills. 

00:34:45
TIM BOND Yes. 

00:34:45
FRANK WILLS So, you know creating that understanding, I think helped us develop a lot to, can you tell me how that came about and… 

00:34:55
TIM BOND Well, it came out… 

00:34:55
FRANK WILLS …your thought how about that? 

00:34:55
TIM BOND Yes, out, I mean it came out because there were… I was very concerned that BAC is it was then should value both those people who offer counseling skills as well as those people who wanted to have a more robust professional identity as counselors. Because I was quite concerned that we could end up with an area of professional knowledge, which is quite exclusive. 

00:35:25
FRANK WILLS Hmm… hmm… 

00:35:25
TIM BOND And everything I saw in the caring professions that really led me to believe that there's a value of having people who listen carefully and interact sensitively and constructively, those people without necessarily taking on the counseling role that might be anybody from a tutor to a social worker, to a nurse, to a doctor, it could well be it's… it's… uh… people performing seemingly non-clinical roles, the receptionist, the… the cleaners and so on. And, and that's been quite less time to at least working with people outside the world of counseling and I've really seen the value of that. And so, I was quite keen to try and as it were separate the two sort of the needs at these distinctive groups uses the counseling skills and counselors could be acknowledged and valued. 

00:36:25
FRANK WILLS Uh… Was that an initiative you kind of an idea you've… 

00:36:30
TIM BOND I don't think I was unique in it, if I'm be correctly(ph) I think it grew out of conversations and I had was Brady Pont(ph) and Frank Eskensiv(ph) who I think you've already interviewed in the series. 

00:36:40
FRANK WILLS And lets say… 

00:36:40
TIM BOND It… it was… it was something that was around in the air at that time, I… it wasn't something I did just on my own as a way… I think I formalized it and gave it words, but the spirit was very much around. 

00:36:55
FRANK WILLS Okay. And a couple of other things that and one was that to you were involved in HIV counseling… 

00:37:00
TIM BOND Hmm… hmm… 

00:37:00
FRANK WILLS …as well at this time and how… how did that come a person and what was your perspective on that? 

00:37:05
TIM BOND Well, the… during the mid-80's to the early 90's as there was great more panic about HIV and I had been active in the gay movement as I… up until my mid-30's thereabouts in the northeast where we had a low instance for HIV. Um… whereas it developed to HIV and AIDS related service in London were highly politicized and full of the inevitable sorts of competition and feuds and different beliefs about the best ways of doing things, charged with the sense of urgency that the more panic and also that HIV as it was then was a life-threatening conditions to the people who are living their lives very intensively. It had to be that they would end quickly. Uh… and the part of health and BACP both came together to start to look at what was needed to develop good HIV counseling services in part because there was no effective drug treatments at that time, so this was the only fetched, a viable way of offering a service. And because I was outside the politics, but named several participants and I was considered as a suitable person to go in and produce those studies and we did a national survey and I then went on, did various regional studies around the management of confidentiality and so on and it was an opportunity for me which is unusual in the context of attics to get to be funded, to look in detail of what people do and what their clients experiences are. And that had quite an impact on me and it generated a set of experiences uh… and an opportunity to rethink again ethics uh… and probably, more to anything else took(ph) sort of had it wait to my unease of our heading turn of anti-legalistic approach to guides. So probably, there that laid the seeds um… for the… the developments took place later in terms of BACP and it's movement towards ethical frameworks, but I thought… who's very powerful working to people uh… who were experiencing such difficulty because of the social environment at the time and having to draw very deeply on their in sense of their own values um… and their in sense of what was right and wrong um… and… and yet not all having the same views it… it was a very intense experience. 

00:40:05
FRANK WILLS And it sounds like you would just generally very busy at this time because you were also still working on the various um… ethical codes that were working through… 

00:40:15
TIM BOND Yes, yeah. 

00:40:15
FRANK WILLS …the system, trainer, supervisors and eventually, more recently, research and you were also starting to write though… 

00:40:25
TIM BOND Yes. 

00:40:25
FRANK WILLS …about HIV and the in about… 

00:40:25
TIM BOND Yes. 

00:40:25
FRANK WILLS …done this in ethics and so forth. And probably and… would you mind me saying that, it seems like your major publications is that, this time there's an ethics and would is that, would you agree with that? 

00:40:40
TIM BOND What are the books… 

00:40:40
FRANK WILLS Yes, yes. 

00:40:40
TIM BOND Yes, I do agree with that, I tend to use that as a vehicle for bringing together all the different projects I've been involved with and it sort of re… take this as an opportunity to rethink each time I produce that book within two editions now there is a third edition, which should be coming, I'm working on at the moment, you know. 

00:41:00
FRANK WILLS And you can see your thinking, developing in those… 

00:41:00
TIM BOND Absolutely, yeah. 

00:41:00
FRANK WILLS …books you're saying that, that thinking reflected… 

00:41:05
TIM BOND I'm a writing staff… 

00:41:05
FRANK WILLS …and then actually quote. 

00:41:05
TIM BOND I look at the early ones now, no wins. 

00:41:10
FRANK WILLS I was slightly ensured that because of course, the second edition came out in 2000, which was quite close to the… um… production of the framework, but unless I miss it, I couldn't see any reference to the… a framework was likely to come out, did you have to keep this under raps or something like that? 

00:41:30
TIM BOND No, my thinking was still evolving. 

00:41:30
FRANK WILLS Right. 

00:41:30
TIM BOND And writing the book nudged me in that direction. 

00:41:35
FRANK WILLS Yeah. 

00:41:35
TIM BOND And I've been always be very lucky with BACP uh… they all are organization unlike some find sometimes set it would are really willing to rethink where they go and so um, as a result of writing the second edition I've started to think a new pro… what could the alternative be. 

00:41:55
FRANK WILLS That being us, were you asked to do that then? 

00:42:00
TIM BOND Um… 

00:42:05
FRANK WILLS How did the… how did the framework come about sort of thing? 

00:42:05
TIM BOND Well, framework came about that's where they pragmatic need really, that, that at that time BACP was publishing three separate codes, if not four separate codes that the… there the code for counselors, code for trainers and code for supervisors. And because the amount of work are so getting more detailed longer the amount of work uh… in producing them they always have to sink with each other, there always some inconsistency somewhere and so the decision would be made, it would be much better for an administrative point of view, we had a single boat together within one umbrella. Um… and that's gritty(ph) what I was requested to do, but I then sort of reflected on the difficultly of doing that and also thought as an opportunity to perhaps reconsider whether we were heading the right direction because you… and you had to look across the Atlantic to see that that you got the American Psychological Association and the American Counseling Association who had uh… published codes and professional conduct procedures were… which were significantly longer and more elaborate and more detailed than ours. And we were heading in the same direction. 

00:43:25
FRANK WILLS Could only go. They… 

00:43:25
TIM BOND Could… could only go bigger and get more detailed. But we're encountering lots of difficulties with going down this road that, say for instance, just to give you a few examples, what was thought to be good practice in employee counseling was considered very poor practice in student counseling. And yet, both groups in good fate, for good ethical reasons had developed their context to the specific practices. So for example, um… in student counseling it was generally considered to be accepted that it was poor practice to uh… be involved with teaching your own clients, and of course, the context of higher and further education that were indeed the matter of schools, the one of the biggest stresses on the student's is assessment, so keeping the service separate from that and the complete power dynamics and complications of that makes lot of sense. But the context for employee counselors, you might well be asked to provide some sort of human relationship skills to a whole team of people. If you apply that rule rigorously, you might find students saying well I teach everybody in that office, but I can't teach Harry because he's a client. And even, if you didn't declare that, I bet you it become obvious to everybody else that he had become your client. So, they had adopted quite a different way of handling these situations and there were numerous examples like that and you've seen to more specific regard, the more we were creating tensions which divided us and you… you quite getting to this invidious position and sort of validating one person's practice and inadvertently invalidating somebody else's. So, I wanted to step back from all that and just think again about how we could create an ethical framework which would help us to engage with the ethical challenges of an increase in diverse set of settings, different client groups. Um… and relatively have a sort of central set of rule started to promote ideas round ethical mindfulness what do we need to be ethically minded in our work. 

00:45:40
FRANK WILLS It's certainly just occurs actually that because you said it um… certainly become evident to me rather that um, you… you very skillfully buck the trends that go longer and longer and that's various concrete whole cultural trend as well. 

00:46:00
TIM BOND If you're going to get caught up in the sort of um… very prescriptive, rule-driven systems then that's the way it goes and you don't have to look very far in this country to other professions if you look at the guidelines for solicitors and their codes are indeed increasing the medical codes, they've just gone longer and longer and longer, but they haven't actually managed to stop the worst accesses of malpractice and so, one of the things which I'm still sort of reflecting on that moment is that I've tried to… I started to talk about ethics being in different registers that maybe um… and if I… because it got the framework as it is now in 2006. I'm not sure I've quite got these registers quite relying to within the framework, but that could enough for practical purposes that you need… what… there is a place for any professional body to say for the purposes protecting our clients and the public reputation of the profession. We do need some strict rules, which we will really enforce that need be with sanctioned. Um… and that sort of tally all the link type uh… thing, but I think you should keep place to the minimum and I think the danger if you go simply stay in that register of rules that must be obeyed then you ride rough short over much more complex ethical judgments which all practitioners are involved with and that's where the notion of principles and personal moral qualities becomes much more helpful and that's where the ethical framework is strong. But increasingly, I started to ask myself what's missing from that is the third register. And the third register, I become much more interested in… in started to elaborate in the context of research ethics. He's around the intrinsic ethics, I mean the nature of rules and the nature of the principles is there out there are external point of reference that allow someone to turn something and how can I take a view of the messiness and the ambiguity and of the challenges that I face in my work. But is… is that turning away from the person you're working with always appropriate, is there a way about articulating an ethic, which could help us in… if you die working together in our relationships that would encourage dialogue, would encourage a shared way of addressing ethical issues. Um… so that the locus of ethical control rests in the relationship and I've been experimenting with ethics of trust, trustworthiness in that context. 

00:48:55
FRANK WILLS Can… can we just come back as in the mode… 

00:48:55
TIM BOND Yeah. 

00:48:55
FRANK WILLS …you sought it to just one or two points about the… about the framework itself and then we can think about you know what else you're thinking about it. But um… um it seems to me that the what you say about values is very key you know to… in a way to doing the trick of and getting around it um… um… moral judgments without the um, you know the over prescriptive rules kind of thing. 

00:49:25
TIM BOND And the over prescriptive rules were always problematic in a profession which inevit… almost it variably works in private invisible even from place colleagues. You've got to somehow feed that moral reservoir, the ethical reservoir of concern which draws most people into a profession in one sense, I'm sure lot of us would love it to be better paid and carry more prestige and status at times, it's just frustrating sometimes being on the margins. But one of the advantages of it is that by large most people come into it because they are ethically concerned and ethically motivated right from the start as how we as a profession built on that and in format and strategic, I mean uh… increases reach uh… seems to reach with a biggest challenge because that's you know most around those don't preach what am I call those sort of tallyonic(ph) basic rules most members are struggling with ethical challenges which are more subtle in that. 

00:50:30
FRANK WILLS And… and in a way that… that the uh… uh… uh… a really um… helpful point you made I think is of course that even that… that these values that we tend to sign up for these values themselves can be in… in conflict with each other at times. 

00:50:50
TIM BOND Oh, that's doubt. 

00:50:50
FRANK WILLS You know for example, between the client safety and autonomy… 

00:50:55
TIM BOND Yes. 

00:50:55
FRANK WILLS …to take one of the more famous one as it were… 

00:50:55
TIM BOND Yes. Well, I mean one of the things which I personally experienced quite a lot of difficulty seeing my way through in the process developing; a lot of this was… I was so excited by joining professional group in the mid-80's around an ethic of respectful client autonomy because that was so different from what I've seen and it was also probably one of the reasons why I left social work too because I saw that respect for client autonomy diminishing and the potential for that as things were then diminishing. And then slowly after several decades, I start to come more and more weird limitations for ethic of autonomy. There was a very obvious challenges from the women's movement about, it's a very particular understanding of self government and it's and in the context of the gender conflicts of feel that, the masculine view of self was someone who is detached and free to go in any direction as possible whereas the female experience of it was prevented more as being aware of relationships and being interconnected both with pass gener… older people and younger people and having a more constrained, a more collective sense of self. And I'm not sure I buy into those as being gendered and I think a lot of people moved away from that, but there are those different understandings and then when you work with traditional communities, the notion of self in some cases, some communities, there's no language for self. The first point of ethical reference, the first to you and first uh… yes, ethical unit is the family, the extended family. And in some cases, as I was just got hold initial context with the Maoris(ph) that family is determined into not just those relying our ancestors. And so, um… that gives us sort of communitarian point of better term way of understanding self and raises another set of issues and cast solely at the principles into a very different light. 

00:53:05
FRANK WILLS Can I just… just um… pass you one… one sort I'm not certainly reservation, but wondering how this actually works, you know in practice that, that occurred to me. Um… because I suppose in a way I… I wonder if as… as you know uh, helpful it seems to me as a… as a counselor, I… I wonder whether what could happen though is that in a way um… you know problems that arise between us and our clients uh… are now more likely to be decided on my counselor values because they'll be judged by the kind of committee of counselors and… and the client maybe won't have that sentence in which to say yeah, but it's setting you a code, you should have done this kind of thing. I don't know this perhaps it… it's an only intentional potential for shift… shifting it um… a slightly away from the client? 

00:54:15
TIM BOND I don't think it's a easy way round that the old system where you had to clear rules that clients could point to face lots of problems for clients. First of all, they had to learn what the rules were when they felt they had a grievance, also, what did they do if by some mischance that particular concern wasn't covered by a rule and similarly the… the panels who had to then hear the grievance also found themselves struggling with interpreting rules which didn't exactly match the circumstances. So the alternative is you go for a view where and… and I think this… the evidence is that seems to be working from the clients perspective better where they just simply are invited to state what it is that's causing on concern. And the practitioner is invited to respond and the emphasis is on the practitioner providing the ethical justification for what they done, can they convince a group of people, which includes like people. Uh… but you know they have attended to it. 

00:55:20
FRANK WILLS But presently, you… you… you don't attend these kind of hearings and… 

00:55:20
TIM BOND No. No because… 

00:55:25
FRANK WILLS …so you're going on what people are telling you, but that's people saying to you. 

00:55:30
TIM BOND Well, I do attend trainings of adjudicators um… and I do um… spend time talking to people both of whom have appeared in front of such panels as a person around whom was being complained us well at sometimes talking to clients who brought complaints. I don't think there is ever a painless way you've going through that sort of process. Um… I wish that was, but at the end of the day it isn't a therapeutic process so attempt to resolve an area of conflict when all of the processes had been exhausted. And so, there is that sense of people are coming up against a decision around right or wrong in a way which a lot of the time we're not faced to it in the therapeutic room, in our therapeutic work. Uh… and so if you would have a powerful feelings about it but one of the things I'm pleased about the… about the way it now operates is we are starting to get people who through the system particularly those who have been given them more educative outcome when something has been found against them as counselors or psychotherapists. I was starting to say it was awfully painful, but we have to learn something from it and that for me seems much more satisfactory outcome. So, I think whilst I understand peoples trepidation and fear and I would share that… some of that myself a sort of complaint against me. I also think that in some ways we are getting it right in very important way, it is more of a dialogue, it's not a really aggressive litigation unless one of the parties brings that into it, it don't have the same opportunity to present their case and it's… it's fairer decision as people can make in good faith. So, we're not… we're not like the GMC or General Medical Council or some of the other professional bodies and where it is very protracted, adversarial, litigation. 

00:57:50
FRANK WILLS You make a good case. 

00:57:50
TIM BOND Yeah. I was sure, you know I personally wish we could never have to have them at all, but you know but the truth is that you know all of us, the matter how I could so to speak for myself you know all of us have bad moments with clients and maybe it's a very fine thread between any one of us having a client uh… pursuing a serious complaint, adorability to recover from those restraints. 

00:58:15
FRANK WILLS Tim it's been really fascinating talking to you, I'm very enlightening I must say. We ought to be moving toward to close now, but I did want suggest both and invite you to think forward from here both personally, I you're your interest in narrative research, I know your interest issue of trust that you just said. And maybe also for a… a final reflection on counseling itself, British counseling itself is funny old world you joined in the early 80's and now 25 years later is presumably a big difference and I just be well interested to hear your final thoughts on that. 

00:58:55
TIM BOND Well, I mean I think there are some of things which I… I think in terms of ethics, I'm very interested in this notion of an ethic, an intrinsic ethic I supposed to extrinsic ethic and building on the work of people like Neil(ph) at the ethic of trust, which is what I'm writing about at the moment. The narrative research is partly contributed to that because the whole process of that… of doing that if we search you know we should engage in peoples stories, it's another way of hearing what matters to people and what meaning they take out at their life stories at working with colleagues like Jenks Bedishei(ph) the talented(ph) other people in Bristol um… has opened up new possibilities enabled me to hear new things and ethics that keeps the life for me, but it's introduced me challenges. In terms of the profession, um… I do see as changing quite a lot and… and funny enough, I don't think it has a lot to do refer with statutorily regulated or not, I think society is changing, peoples expectations are changing. And maybe one of our… biggest challenges is how to live with the differences of contemporary society and so I see so one of the ethical and professional challenges that we have ahead of us is how to grab all with difference more respectfully and perhaps we have done in the past and in a way in which I'm trying to present ways in which we all work from each other differences. It's not, we're alone in that because if unfortunate travel industry offers everybody opportunities to see their culture a fresh, but… but… 

01:00:50
FRANK WILLS Can we do it too. 

01:00:50
TIM BOND Yes, I think so. I think the difficulty in perfectly and at times it will go disastrously wrong, but yes. I think it's better done or not done. 

01:01:00
FRANK WILLS I think on that um… inspiring, I'm realistic note we will… will end the interview. Thank you, Tim. 

01:01:05
TIM BOND Thank you. 

01:01:05
FRANK WILLS Very much its been a great pleasure. 

01:01:05
TIM BOND Thank you, I've enjoyed it too. Thank you, Frank for this giving the opportunity.

The school of health and social sciences at the University of Wales, Newport is developing a wide range of videos and DVDs aimed at counselors, counseling trainers, their students and at anyone interested in developing their use of communication skills. We offer programs demonstrating good practice and bad practice, we give critiques of the use of counseling skills. And we explore the way in which those skills can be used in a variety of helping settings. Using a wide range of examples, in an informative, but light-hearted manner, we look at the ways in which help and support and counseling can be offered, both in face-to-face work and over the telephone. We have also developed a series of programs in which key practitioners discuss their work and ideas. In this series, in common with all the material has been welcomed by many counseling trainers. Whether you're a trainer, a counselor, a student or someone who uses counseling skills as part of their everyday work, we think that we'll have something to interest you. Call for a brochure or visit our website and see what we've got to offer.
