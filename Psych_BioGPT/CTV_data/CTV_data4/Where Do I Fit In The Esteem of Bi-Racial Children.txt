CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Hello. I'm glad you're taking the time to join me in this conversation because it's a worthy one. Now many years ago at least in the profession of counseling, we identified diversity as the fourth force in counseling. But I don't even think they thought in that time that the concepts that we're talking about today would be as important. You know the world is changing. We live in a nation where our national motto is, “e pluribus unum,” out of many, one. And part of that many are children who have different race based parentage. Now typically we talk about biracial children as black and white, whether the mother's black or the father's black or the mother's white or the father's white. But really it goes beyond that. And while that might not seem too important to some, well, to the child it becomes quite important. So me talking to you today is about really examining how we help the esteem of biracial children by asking the question for them or saying it on their behalf, “Where do I fit in?” Now what does that question come from? Think about this; right now on national television on the ESPN network you have an anchor by the name of Sage Steele. Now by all accounts a very attractive woman and by all accounts very competent and certainly very professional, who is doing a very good job reporting various sports stories on a regular basis day by day. What many don't know is that Sage Steele is a biracial child. Now Sage Steele's mother is Caucasian, Sage Steele's father is black. The question that's always been asked of Sage Steel is, “What are you?” In her own admonition she talks about not really wanting to check a box of who she might be. The question that we have to deal with as clinicians trying to help children like this or people in this situation, really is examining how they feel about who they are. I know a great professor that retired from John Hopkins University, a doctor Mary Gwindin, colleague and mentor of mine, is an expert in self esteem literature. Now, she defines self esteem as a means to understand who you are, what you do, how you do it, based on how you feel about yourself. And the most important part, how the world around you gives you cues about who you are and your worth. So self esteem for Doctor Mary Gwindin in a sense is how do you feel about you and how do you feel about how others feel about you. Now for most children that's just something that you have to deal with, something that we all have dealt with. I'm certainly sure that in your training you might wonder how you feel about yourself and other professors. I know I did when I was in school. But if you are of biracial parentage in our society today, well that esteem is what we just said it was. What I would like clinicians to understand, it's more than that for that child. So we carry all the same issues of how we feel and how we think people feel about us. But with biracial children, well they have to add a little bit of something extra. See I'm from Louisiana and I'm from the west bank of New Orleans and down there we have a word called lagniappe. And lagniappe is, it really means a little something more. So the esteem of biracial children has a little bit of lagniaape in it. And what is that? Well that's the social racial political climate that we live in. So for all clinicians, if you want to help this population of client you need to understand the context if you wanna help heal the pain. The context. Number one; we would like to avoid it sometimes and we would like to get rid of it on other times. Sadly, it still presents itself. And what is that? That is that race is a matter of conversation in our nation. We try to get around it. And every time we try to get around it we typically find ourselves right in the middle of it. So I want all the clinicians to know the first step in working with this population, if you wanna help when they're in front of you, is first you have to be comfortable with your understanding and consciousness about race in society. In the recent seven years we've had a president who on the surface is African American but we know he comes from mixed race parentage. And a lot of things get said about that. The biggest issue that gets said about that is this issue of choice. Like Sage Steele, like the president, like many, people want to know for whatever reason, what are you? As clinicians we have to know that's a question that they have grappled with for a very long time. But that's not really where the emotive piece is. The part that really gets them upset inside. The part that gets them upset inside is being forced through societal cues, directly and indirectly, to choose in the first place. Think about if you had to choose between your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family. Choosing between your eye color. Whose was best and whose was perceived as not as best. That can be quite troubling. To see forms day after day, year after year that kind of push you in a direction to say I could only be one thing. While you consciously live a life that says you are made up of multiple things. That could be quite distressing. So the clinician has to understand the context of the biracial child, that for a long time consciously and unconsciously, they have been asked to choose. I would warn you not to make the same mistake as our society has made because of the context of race in the first place. The esteem dimension, which I like to always say goes for the emotive side of why they're sitting in front of us, why they're seeking help from you and why they might be seeking help from me, although their overt reason might be a relationship or their overt reason might be a conflict on the job. Research has shown that the emotive ability to see yourself through conflict, which counselors like to call coping, is a part of this imbalance between how they see themselves and how they feel others see themselves as well. So the clinician cannot be one that avoids, if you will, the conversation about their development overall. How do they see themselves early on. If and when the concepts of race came up, how did they address those concepts. Were they raised in a two parent household or they're raised by a relative, which happens on occasion, or raised by just one of the parents. These are issues that are part and parcel to helping biracial children live adaptively. I believe you, as I believe I, want to make sure all of my clients are able to live well and be able to cope with life on life's terms. However, the clinician who's not willing to have a race based conversation with that particular child, it might take a little longer to help them in a way that's most beneficial. So number one; if you wanna understand, if you wanna help this population, understand the context if you wanna heal the pain. Race in America is a real discussion. It's more overt now than it has been in some time, but it's always there. So the question is how do we see black versus white? How do we see Asian versus Jewish? How do we see all these color schemes which tends to start the conversation when it comes to race and biracial children. You know a fancy movie that I just happen to love was called, “Midway.” And in this movie “Midway” it was not a black-white issue. It was a race issue because the son of a Navy fighter pilot, who was one himself, wanted to marry a Japanese girl by ethnicity but raised in Southern California. And because Pearl Harbor had just happened neither family was against it, but mostly the Japanese woman's family was against it, told her explicitly not to marry outside of her race. And that was shocking for some. Cause they didn't want the two to blend together. Why? The question over what would the child be, what would the children be. See that's something that our society has to work on. Cause these children are being told based on how they look you have to choose. And that's something that we have to work on. But that choosing issue is so heavily rooted in historical inequities that it bears on the psyche and soul of that child, again, to effect the way they feel about themselves based in part on the feedback they get from the world around them. So the clinician has to be aware of that and that context. The second dimension that a clinician, I believe, ought to be aware of and I want you to be aware of, is the concept of patience. The patience concept for biracial children is quite serious, not always written about. Because you have to determine how long or how much or how far you will go in any given day to examine the racial makeup of this child in front of you. Do they see it as you see it? Is it too distressing to talk about? Those kinds of concepts. Something that you must always think about when working with this population. Third and I think most important when you look at biracial children is this concept of skin color. You know there's a thing in diversity talk when it comes to these kinds of issues called passing. And passing is a phrase that we apply to certain people who can fit the dominant culture's view of in a sense citizenship. In this case, being white. So if you have biracial children, no matter what the racial parentage, but they look as if they're in the dominant culture, they tend to be able to relieve themselves from certain pains and certain pressures because of their appearance. And that's important because they still have internal conflict but because the outside review tends to be less than that of wow this black or this this person, they tend to go around that. The issue we have to worry about is when the biracial child looks as if they're a person of color. That's when the issues that effect their esteem tend to magnify. When the questions start being raised about who are you. Sage Steele always talks about her current life, although she's a biracial child and most people don't know it, she married a lovely man from her college days who is white. Their children have taken on the features of their father. So when they go out in public she admits this people ask her a lot of questions about her family. The biggest one that she spoke about was, “Are you the nanny?” And they ask that question because still in our society the feedback is that doesn't work, that doesn't fit. So the biracial child gets these messages. And the clinician, that's you, that's me, ought to be able to be one skilled and competent to address these issues and then skilled and competent to assist the child, cope with this to impart better esteem on themselves so they can see the world better and be better in our society. That's the task that we have in front of us. I would hope that you and I will grow stronger in our skill-set to do just that; to help the biracial child see themselves for who they are and help them cope with what they get from the world around them by helping them understand the history that surrounds what others see, so they know better how to deal with it and address their issues and of course be better at it in the future. Thank you very much.

THERAPY Talks 

00:16:45
SHANNON DERMER Doctor Ellis, thank you. I have a personal question to start off with if you don't mind. I know that in a different talk you mentioned that through technology and through some of those genealogy programs that you found out that you had some native American and Caucasian ancestors. 

00:17:05
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS I do on my grandmother's side, a generation up in the days that seem ancient for some and palpable for me. Yes, my great grandmother was a native American. I don't know the tribe. And the man she fell in love with was a white man in Mississippi. 

00:17:25
SHANNON DERMER So do you consider yourself biracial or do you only connect with, cause that is a couple generations back. 

00:17:35
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS I didn't before I found this out. Since I found it out and I'm all about this in my work I began saying technically, that's the current way I'm saying it, technically I'm biracial. The unique thing about why I say technically I am is based on what I look like. I don't think I'm gonna get any any I guess kudos or acknowledgment of my Indian roots or my Caucasian roots because of what I look like. And that's something that is a part of this conversation. Certainly my uncles and aunts, yes, they could be considered biracial also except in Mississippi in the early 1900s. That's not what they look like. I kinda enjoy to know that about my family, but I'm also open to that. So it doesn't impact my esteem, actually it might raise it a few points, that that's actually a part of my family. 

00:18:40
SHANNON DERMER Now you mentioned this and it actually is part of our history of if you had so much black or African American blood, you were considered black. Even if it was a drop. Now you mention, though, that part of the identity for the biracial child depends on if they look more like the parent who's in the more privileged, dominant group or if they look more like the parent who is in the less privileged group, the non-dominant group, the one who faces more prejudice. Talk a little bit more about that, about how you help children or adults when they look more like the non-dominant group. 

00:19:25
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Yes, when you have that situation and they're in your office, it's because something happened. We never can forget about being clinicians that certainly people come to therapy after they try to cope themselves and things might not work or they're referred or they're told to go, issues in school, not getting along, those kinds of things. And it's really not the easiest thing to do to try to address hundreds of years of chaos on a nine year old. But what I have found and what the research is showing that unless we are willing to have these conversations cause the child is wondering why am I getting all this heat when I'm just nine years old, I'm just going to school. And why is my family being looked at so differently than other peoples' family, there's a social political context that goes with that. And it really is on the talent of the clinician doing the work. But to explain that people are talking about you without knowing you and it comes from this place, I have seen it help the child in the long run. Many say, “Oh, so it's not really about me.” And they start to feel better. And again that's really the critical point about the esteem dimension of this because esteem by Doctor Gwenden's example is how you feel. My good friend Doctor Carlson always would say feelings aren't facts. So we gotta be careful about how we feel when we oughta make them facts. So we try to help the child know if you're feeling bad about your parents, you have a right to your feeling, as a good humanist would say, but that don't make them the facts about you and your family. 

00:21:15
SHANNON DERMER No, but it does make it the reality in that moment. 

00:21:15
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS And that's where the work begins because we wanna help them understand they have a right to feel what they're feeling and then we start to do, some people in fancy language might call it address the dissonance of their cognition. But. 

00:21:30
SHANNON DERMER That was fancy. 

00:21:30
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Yes it is. I got a thought from there and run for a while. But we want to make sure they understand yes, you know, mom and dad do mom and dad things and let's talk about that. Now we, down the road in session two or three, we start to blend in all the other peripheral issues that cause a child to start to wonder and doubt and question. And I have seen it work well when they begin to understand that okay, and this is what Janet Helms would talk about in her “People of Color Scale,” and Teryl talked about years ago how we go through stages of understanding. So we're kind of the ushers of that understanding dimension to get them to a place to recognize they are not abnormal, although people are trying to give them that kind of feedback. 

00:22:20
SHANNON DERMER So as the clinician we're the one who's trying to help them usher through the process of self identity, how they want to identify. And do you think that it is actually possible to honor both, I mean if we're talking about two identities, it could be multiple, but do you think it's possible to truly honor both identities from each parent equally? 

00:22:45
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS I believe so. And I might be a dreamer, as the song said. But I believe it's possible but there are two major pieces to make that work. One, on a large global piece, and you understand this from your lovely work and background, there's a family system here. You know I'm not systematic. 

00:23:05
SHANNON DERMER I know. I was just about to say a words family. 

00:23:10
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Yes, there is a family system here and for me as a human is that's more of the nurturing factor. I would want my client's family to be a part of that work. Because I would have to ask the adults in the room some hard questions. And one of those is, is this an openly talked about issue? My father, for example, could tell me for days and I loved hearing about my great great grandfather and great great grandmother, but I'm so far removed from the chaos they went through, it was easy for me to have that lesson. And being part of a family that was on the other side of justice, to a degree, I was not about to become an instrument of destruction; oh I got a white great great grandfather but I keep that quiet. That kind of thing. So I would hope the family would be able to say we nurture our child for who we are and what we do. That's one hand. The other hand, I would want the child to be ushered through certain stages to make a connection to both sides of their family. The problem is I don't know how the family lives. 

00:24:25
SHANNON DERMER Well that's what I was gonna ask you, making that connection to both sides of the family, do you think it's more difficult, you mentioned with, what was her name, the sports anchor? 

00:24:35
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Sage Steele. 

00:24:35
SHANNON DERMER Sage Steele. That it was difficult for her cause she appears to only have the identity of African American even though she's biracial. And then her children appeared to only have the identity of European American or Caucasian, how do you help the, cause the connection goes both ways, you mentioned on family systems, it goes both ways so in order for the child to connect in some ways, how do you help the parents to accept the fact that their child has multiple identities? 

00:25:05
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Well that's where the first discussion I tend to have when that is a center issue with the parents when the child's not in the room, I ask them “How do you two talk about this at home?” And I have to ask other harder questions that we presuppose parents can handle because they're the adults in the room. But I ask questions, “Do you have ethnic connection to each side? Or is it a matter of living in the vale of the American society?” And of course the Boslen phrase, living in the vale, meaning that it's not something that's discussed. You just call yourself an American if you're on the Caucasian side. And you're not doing Irish ethnic traditions, you're not doing Italian traditions, you're not doing German traditions, Scandinavian traditions, whatever have you, even English traditions. You're not doing those. So then the child sees white America in a sense, and there's nothing wrong with that, but the child sees that as one part. And then you have the social political climate defining the other part. And if that's the way they run the household their child's gonna have a harder time. 

00:26:15
SHANNON DERMER So they're not overtly helping their children to understand and see and connect with each parent's background. 

00:26:25
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Exactly. 

00:26:25
SHANNON DERMER It's gonna make it more difficult. 

00:26:25
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS That's a difficult proposition for a child because to be stereotypical just for a quick minute, which I don't like to do but I'll do it; Christmas time can come and you can say you have pig's feet and collard greens and all that good stuff, which I don't mind eating, except for the pig's feet, I won't do that. And you say, “Okay, this is what we do as black people.” So you got one side. Then you look at the other side of the table and what do you have? Typically you call Christmas turkey and stuffing and you say, “Okay that's Christmas. But is that my mother's Christmas?” In that case for Sage Steele. Or is that just a blanket Christmas? So the child has to discern where is it ethnic and where is it just normal. And I'm saying it that way on purpose because that becomes a socio-political message that there's a sub-culture and the culture. Not a German-Irish, if they don't live that way. 

00:27:30
SHANNON DERMER Right and it's been talked about before that European Americans actually have that privilege of not thinking that they have a culture or sometimes ethnicity. 

00:27:40
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Well they have the privilege of being able to choose if they wanna do it or not. 

00:27:45
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:27:45
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS And blacks tend not to have that. Asians who look Asian, don't. Even my Jewish brothers who really and I don't even know if that's right to say, they have more overt Jewish features, they don't get that right. 

00:28:00
SHANNON DERMER Right. Because we're identified a lot of times by how we look. So you're saying that it's important that even if in some ways that because that you have the choice to connect with your identity or not, when you have a biracial child, it's more important for you to be aware of your own cultural and ethnic background and make your children aware of that, not through lecturing them necessarily. But through traditions and through overtly saying, “This is our Jewish heritage or this is our German heritage.” And I'd love to talk more about this but we have to wrap up, we're running out of time. 

00:28:35
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS But that nurturing piece is the key. 

00:28:35
SHANNON DERMER Nurturance is the key. And helping them through that process is the key. And I wanna thank you all for helping us discuss that process today. If you'd like to hear more about Doctor Ellis's views or if you would like to hear more from some of our other experts, please visit the Alexander Street Press website.
