JOHN S. WESTEFELD Hi! My name is John Westefeld. I'm a professor in the Counseling Psychology Program at University of Iowa, and I'm here today to talk with you about the topic of suicide. This is a topic that I care very deeply about, both personally and professionally. I've been interested in it for many, many years. The interest really goes back to, ah, my high school years. And during high school, I had a very close friend who killed himself and has obviously made a huge impact on me. I think the seeds of my interest in being a psychologist were sown back then, in the mid-1960s, ah, when my friend ended his own life. My mom's sister also, ah, suffered from what we used to call manic depression, we now call bipolar disorder. And she actually made nine different suicide attempts, ah, during her lifetime. She was never successful, but, again, the impact of that on me was huge and fostered an interest in trying to examine the topic of suicide, why it happens and what we can do about it. So the interest is both personal and professional. Uhm, I've worked in the area now since, ah, the late 1970s, and it's a big area of interest for me both in terms of clinical work, ah, as well as research. What we're gonna do in this videotape is talk about, ah, four different areas. The first thing we're going to talk about is a little bit of information about, ah, the nature and extent of the problem and some data about the prevalence of suicide. Secondly, we're gonna talk about how does one go about assessing suicidal risk uhm, in a client. Third, we're going to talk about, ah, interventions with the suicidal client. And in that segment of the tape, we're also going to discuss a little bit about prevention and postvention, uhm, as well as intervention. And finally, at the very end, and very briefly, we're gonna touch on a couple of resources that might be, ah, helpful to those of you, ah, who work in this area. There is a handout, uhm, that you can, ah, refer to and I will refer to throughout the videotape, ah, that highlights a number of the topics that I'm gonna talk about. So with that introduction, the first thing we're gonna discuss, ah, is a little bit about some basic data related to suicide. I need to mention, first of all, it is actually quite hard to get accurate data in this area. And the reason for that is there are times, ah, when we don't know for sure if a death is a suicide or not. Uhm, single vehicle automobile accidents are one of the best examples of that phenomenon. But be that as it may, data are collected about suicide. And if you will refer to, ah, handout A, you'll see a summary of what I feel are some of the most important data, ah, that we have related to this issue. These data come from a variety of sources. I've accessed them from the American Association of Suicidology. Uhm, in turn, they've also come from the National Center for Health Statistics, ah, Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Data, also, are not typically reported every single year. So the most recent data that I have ah, come from the year 2005. So, there's several things, ah, on the handout that I wanna highlight about data. First of all, in terms of the total number of suicides, completed suicides in the United States. That number has been fairly consistent for quite a few years. I've been looking at these data since 1978. So over that 31-year period, the total number of suicides in the United States has remained pretty constant, between 30 and 33,000. Ah, the latest data we have indicate approximately 32 and a half thousand completed suicides in the United States per year. That's approximately, ah, 89 per day or one every 16 minutes. So in the time it takes me to do this presentation today, which is gonna be about an hour, uhm, about four more people will end their own lives, ah, in the United States. The second thing I wanna point out about the data is that suicide is predominantly, certainly not exclusively, but predominantly a male phenomenon. Again, if you look at the handout, you'll see that there were approximately 26,000 completed suicides by males, 6700 by females. This has also been true for many, many years, ah, this differential. It seems to be the case that women are more likely to attempt suicide, men are more likely to complete suicide. And the reason for that is that men are more likely to use more lethal means. The final thing I wanna point out in terms of the overall data about suicide completion in the United States, it is also predominantly, though again, not exclusively but predominantly a white phenomenon. Ah, if you look at the data you'll see about twenty-nine and a half thousand of the completed suicides were by whites. Ah, about 3100, by non-whites. This, ah, differential has also existed for many, many, many years. There's been a lot of research in to why this differential exist and in my opinion we, we don't really have a good answer ah, to that question. But be that as it may, that differential is pretty dramatic. Ah, on a per day basis that's a difference between 81 per day for whites, nine per day for non-whites. I also wanna point out at the bottom of the handout that suicide currently is the 11th leading cause of death, overall. Ah, heart disease is number one and you can see on the handout the rankings there. It's also the third leading cause of death among people between the ages of 15 and 24. And that ranking of 3rd among ages 15 to 24 has also been true, ah, for many, many years. Ah, accidents being number one, homicide is number two. Finally, there's some information on the handout about attempts. We don't really have a visual statistics about how many people attempt suicide. There have been some estimates made, uhm, by various organizations. Again, in my opinion we, we just don't really know for sure how many people attempt. But on the handout you'll see that, ah, an approximate summary of those data are about 816,000 attempts, ah, per year in the United States, uhm, are estimated. In terms of method, about half of those completed suicides, ah, occur as a result of, ah, ah, firearms followed by suffocation and hanging. At a, a fairly significant percentage of completed suicides in the United States, ah, occur as a result of firearms. This is led, uhm, I might ah, add to a lot of discussion about, ah, ah, legal restriction of access to means of suicide including firearms, which has spurred a considerable debate, uhm, in several venues. So, most important points about, ah, data on suicide summarized on handout A, ah, about 32, 33,000 per year, uhm, more often completed by males, more often attempted by females, uhm, a heavy differential in terms of white versus non-white, eleventh leading cause of death overall, third leading cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds. So that's a summary of some data related to the topic of suicide. The second area I wanna talk about and one of the most important, is of course, is how we go about assessing suicidal risk. Ah, these, ah, ah, compilations of risk assessment, ah, theories about risk assessment have been written about extensively. And handout B, ah, in your packet, ah, summarizes, ah, what I'm gonna talk about in this segment of the video about assessing suicidal risk. I wanna say at the outset, ah, that a very important principle here is, it is extremely difficult, extremely difficult to predict suicide. I'll talk about some of the reasons in a minute but it's important to understand that even with all the things I'm gonna talk about here in terms of the tools we use to try to predict suicide or assess suicidal risk or look at risk factors, it remains very, very difficult. Ah, it's a very inexact science. Uhm, as many of you probably know, predicting harm to others is equally difficult if not more difficult. But even though it is very difficult there are some things we can say about assessing risk and I wanna summarize what a few of those key points are in terms of how we and, ah, the human service professions attempt to determine if someone is going to attempt suicide or not. As you'll see on the handout, ah, Roman number one talks about, "Is there such a thing as a typically suicidal person?" And on the one hand there really is not. All kinds of people are capable of attempting and/or completing suicide. But on this handout I've summarized, ah, five kind of general characteristics that we more often will see in people who are more likely to be suicidal. Though, again, there is no perfect correlation here, of course. First of all, most suicidal people don't really wanna die. They wanna stop living. A subtle but very important distinction. It's not so much that they wanna get to this point, which is death, as much as they wanna get away from this point which is their current life situation. One of the obvious implications of that phenomenon is that if we could help them to see there are other ways of getting away from this as opposed to going to death. And we can sometimes get them through the crisis, keep them alive and make a difference. Secondly, many suicidal people are both hopeless and helpless. Hopeless, they don't think any things ever gonna change and helpless, they don't think there's anything they can do about it. A very lethal combination and, of course, a combination we see in a variety of areas are related to mental health. But this combination of perception that it's never gonna change and there's nothing I can do about it, often correlates with people that are more likely to potentially be suicidal. Number three, most suicidal people want help but it's very hard for them to ask for help. They're often, ah, in my experience, embarrassed about how they feel. Ah, they are often reluctant to bring up the fact that they are suicidal even on a first therapy session. However, if asked about being a suicidal, if asked what we often call "the question." Have you been feeling so badly lately you've thought about harming yourself or words to that effect? Most, most, but not all, most people will answer that question honestly. Unfortunately, they will, often, also answer it ambiguously but we'll return to that, ah, in a few minutes. The key point here is that most suicidal people want help but it's hard to ask for help. Number four is the concept of suicidal erosion. Suicidal erosion refers to the fact that suicide is often, again, not always, but often, not singly caused. There are usually are a multitude of factors that contribute to the person being a suicidal. They've often been nickeled and dimed to death emotionally over some period of time. And finally, is the notion of ambivalence, ambivalence, of course, having, ah, opposite feelings at the same point in time. Ah, in the experience of many suicidologists, ah, suicidal people are often ambivalent. I've had people in my office over a 45, 50, 60 minute timeframe, have shifted 10 or 15 times between, ah, "John, I think I'm gonna do it now." Ah, "Well, no, I'm not. Well, I might. I don't know." They're all over the map. Uhm, this makes it very difficult to assess risk. Ah, the good thing about that ambivalence is they are also malleable. They can be influenced. They can be impacted because of the ambivalence. So, if we can get them into treatment, if we can harness that ambivalence and impact it, we, sometimes, again, can get them through the crisis. So, these are five very general characteristics about people that maybe more likely to be suicidal. Don't really wanna die, wanna stop living, helpless and hopeless, want help but hard to ask, suicidal erosion and the notion of ambivalence, the most general characteristics. The remainder of this handout and what I'm gonna talk about now are some more specific kinds of risk factors that we tend to look for in assessing suicidal risk. The first one is situational clues. Something happens to the person or a series of things happened. Loss is a very good example of this kind of phenomenon. The loss, maybe, are related to physical health or well-being. It maybe related to getting older. It maybe related to relationships. But something happened situationally that may create, ah, a state of suicidality in the person. Number two are the major symptoms of depression. These are summarized on the handout. I wanna highlight one or two that I think are, are some some important, a change in the typical pattern of sleeping and eating, ah, symptoms that we look very carefully at, ah, in examining for depression, as we do in examining for a variety of other diagnosis. But the key here is a change in the typical pattern of eating and sleeping. Some people when they become depressed, ah, they sleep a lot less. They have insomnia, and of course, insomnia can come in a variety of forms. A person can have a trouble falling asleep. A person can wake up, ah, once for two hours during the night. A person can wake up early in the morning and not be able to go back to sleep. But there's some kind of sleep ditur, disturbance, ah, in the sense that the person is sleeping less than they typically sleep. Other people sleep almost all the time when they're depressed. Uhm, 16, 18, 20 hours a day. Same thing with appetite. Some people lose their appetite when they're depressed. Some people begin to engage in binge eating when they're depressed. The key point here though is that there's a change in the typical pattern of eating and sleeping. Ah, something that we always assess for in any kind of, ah, intake workup. Lack of concentration often occurs, ah, with depression. The person may have frequent crying spells. Ah, their sex drive and/or performance may be impacted. They may become more apathetic, ah, change in personal appearance. Ah, there may be an increase use of alcohol and/or drugs. There may be psychomotor agitation or retardation. Ah, there may be overwhelming feelings of, ah, worthlessness, uhm, or guilt. So, the second major category after situational clues is, the person, ah, is experiencing depression, ah, in some way. The third category clues, uhm, are verbal clues. And this is essentially, ah, how the person responds to what I referred to earlier as "the question." Have you been feeling so badly where you've thought about harming yourself or words to that effect. One of the most important things I wanna mention about this, uhm, issue in terms of assessment, ah, is, it's very important not to be afraid to ask the question. There remains a, in my opinion, a, a tremendous myth, ah, among the lay public that by asking that question or bringing up the topic, we will give the person the idea. And the data is overwhelming that that is not the case. It's much more likely you will save a life than cause a suicide by getting the topic out on the table and talking about it. In my experience with beginning therapist, sometimes, they are afraid to ask that question. The reason they're afraid is they are, ah, not very confident of what they will do or if they will do the right thing. If the person answers the question in the affirmative, so, rather than go there and open it up, it feels safer to not open the topic up and ask the question. Uhm, I cannot state strongly enough the importance of raising this issue with the client if you begin to proceed that he or she maybe suicidal. So, verbal clues is the third category. The fourth category is behavioral clues. There are number of these listed on the handout. I wanna highlight a couple of them, ah, in the videotape here. One of the most important behavioral clues is a previous attempt. A lot of research indicates that a significant percentage, and the percentages have been reported in, at different rates. But for the purposes of this presentation, I, I'll just say that I think it is a significant percentage of people who attempt suicide, have attempted in the past. So, we're always more concerned about someone. If they have a history of attempting suicide, and if they do have the history of attempting, there are tend to be three major factors we're interested in about a previous attempt, chronology, lethality, and assisting in the rescue. Chronology first. How long ago was the previous attempt? If they attempted three months ago, I'm more worried about them than if they attempted ten years ago. Second, lethality. How lethal was their previous attempt? Did they take ten or fifteen aspirin or did they slit their wrist and very much intend(ph) to end their life through a very lethal attempt. And finally, assisting in the rescue. Ah, did they attempt in such a way that, ah, they were fairly, usually, able to be encountered by someone else and rescued or did they make the previous attempt in such a way that there was essentially no chance of rescue, ah, even though they ended up surviving the attempt? The bottom line here is, we're interested in assessing risk about the question of, "Did the person attempt in the past?" And if they did attempt in the past, we wanna get information about that attempt, particularly, chronology, lethality, and rescue assistance. I wanna illustrate this principle with a, with a very quick example for many, many years ago. Uhm, I was working in another area, not in the Iowa City and, ah, I was seeing a client who was a graduate student in the Biological Sciences. And this student had access to, a, a lot of different chemicals. This is a day student, so they would, ah, go home about three in the afternoon. Uhm, the student's, ah, mom and dad both work outside the home. The mom intended to come home about 3:15, the dad later on the day. Well, this student made two very different suicide attempts. The first one, the student went home about 2:45 in the afternoon and took about, ah, six Tylenol, and essentially, to lay down in the living room. Uhm, the student's mom came home about fifteen or twenty minutes, found the student, took them to the emergency room and they survived that attempt. That's an example of low lethality, high opportunity for rescue. But this student made a very different attempt, about eight or ten months later. Ah, they accessed some of their chemicals on a hypodermic needle from the lab. They went to a, ah, state park and it was closed for the winter. This was in the depth of winter. They went to the state park. By the end of that state park, somehow, and fill this hypodermic needle up with a concoction of liquid chemicals and injected the, the chemicals into the back of their hand and essentially, to lay down in the middle of the state park to die. The only reason that they survived that attempt was that an off-duty park ranger happened to come along and find them, get them to the hospital and they survived. That's an example of high lethality, low opportunity for rescue. So again, the, the major point I wanna make about this is that, a, a very important behavioral clue is whether the person has attempted before and if they had, we wanna really try to flush out information about that previous attempt. Some other behavioral clues listed on handout B, giving away valued possessions. The keyword there is "valued to the person," not necessarily monetarily valued. But I've had clients I've worked with, who have given away, ah, poems, ah, pieces of art, ah, stuffed animals that are near and dear to them, ah, prior to making a suicide attempt. Procuring any kind of weapon, obviously, is a behavioral clue and should be looked at with concern. Suicide notes are a behavioral clue. Suicide notes, I think are very, ah, interesting and important phenomenon. Ah, when I first entered the field, suicide notes were usually written out in longhand. Ah, then, we went through a period where suicide notes were left on, uhm, audiotape. We then went through a period where they were left on videotape . Ah, now, we have cases where suicide notes were being left in all kinds of different venues, ah, DVD's, ah, there's been a huge increase, in, in suicidal notes and threats being left on the internet, through Facebook and other venues. Uhm, there is a, several organizations that study suicide notes to try to learn more about, to how we can prevent suicide. They do it, it's called sui, ah, psychological autopsies on those notes. Ah, but a suicide note, of course, raises the level of concern again. Organizing personal affairs, making out a will, making out a new will, changing a will can be a behavioral clue. A sudden, unexplained improvement in mood can be a behavioral clue. Now, this can happen for a variety of reasons in psychotherapy. Sometimes, sometimes, it happens because, ah, the ambivalence is gone. The imper, the person has decided they're going to do it. And, ah, the idea here is that, ah, any decision is better than no decision. And so, because the ambivalence is gone, and they've decided that they're gonna do this. They've made a decision. Sometimes, that can lead to a sudden, unexplained improvement in their mood even if they had been presenting as depressed. Again, the keywords there are sudden and unexplained. And finally, having a plan. Uhm, if the clients tells us that they have a specific plan about how they're going to attempt suicide, ah, we're generally more concerned about them than if they're very vague when asked about, "Have they thought about how they would, ah, carry this out." The ei, these seven or eight behavioral clues are also very, very important in assessing suicidal risk, with previous attempt, probably, topping that list for most suicidologists. The, ah, the next category of risk assessment on your handout is listed as testing. And, ah, on handout C, I've provided for you a list of a variety of suicide, ah, tests or scales or assessment devices that have been utilized by some suicidologists. Ah, the top twenty up there under possible suicide scales are pretty much specific to suicidal risk. Then, I've listed six that are related, ah, suicide scales that are sometimes also used. I do wanna mention though that this was a controversial area. Ah, there are therapists who I very highly, ah, respect, who, ah, absolutely believe that, ah, paper and pencil risk assessment measures are a good predictor of suicidal risk. There are also, ah, therapists who I highly respect who absolutely believe that there really are no adequate paper and pencil measures to accurately predict, ah, suicidal risk. So, a lot of difference of opinion about this. Uhm, I've included them here because I think it is important to be aware of the fact that there are suicidologists who believe, ah, strongly in using them, ah, but, but it is a controversial area with, uhm, some difference of opinion, ah, about the validity of paper and pencil measures for assessing risk. Ah, just to give you my own opinion on this, the instrument on that list that I like the best is the Reasons for Living Inventory by Linehan, et al., uhm, developed a number of years ago now, quite a few years ago, but I like this instrument because instead of asking people, ah, why they might end their life, it'd ask them, uhm, even if things were to get really bad, what keeps you going? Why would you continue to live? And this instrument I like because it allows us to build on those strengths, in terms of psychotherapy, and intervene with the person, but again, that's just, ah, a personal opinion of my own. Finally, at, on your handout is, ah, a list of several miscellaneous risk factors or(ph) things we look at for assessing risk, and I wanna say a word or two about, ah, several of those. The first one on your handout is family history. Ah, suicide does tend to run in families, ah, but of course many things run in families: diabetes runs in families, heart disease, cancer, ah, but I, I am more concerned about, ah, someone if there is a history in their family of depression, ah, and/or suicide. So I think it is an important factor to look at. Ah, there are variety of psychiatric diagnosis, of course, that, ah, relate very strongly to, ah, suicidal risk, quite a few of them: ah, depression, of course, ah, borderline personality disorder, substance abuse, uhm, a variety of other mood disorders, ah, so certainly, if the person is diagnosed with a disorder, ah, that raises our concern, certain disorder. People who are more impulsive, ah, raises, ah, my level of concern because, unless sure about, ah, how they may behave in between therapy sessions. So, even if I've gotten them to contract, and we'll talk about contract in a minute, uhm, I worry that their impulsive nature, ah, may cause them to do something even if they have thought, in our therapy session, that they would not try to harm themselves. So, impulsivity, ah, I think is an additional miscellaneous risk factor. How they respond to a contract or a Life Maintenance Agreement, are they willing to contract not to harm themselves, uhm, if they're not, that certainly raises my level of concern. General level of low self-esteem raises my level of concern. Uhm, if they'd been exposed to another person's suicide or suicidal behavior, ah, in my opinion, that's also a risk factor. Ah, there is evidence, certainly, that suicide is a modeled behavior. We do have these phenomena of suicidal clustering that happens, ah, most often in high schools or junior high schools. Ah, so if someone has been around other people who have attempted or completed, again, that raises my level of, ah, concern. If someone has been the victim of violence or victimization, ah, of any form, that is, ah, an additional risk factor, and, certainly, having, ah, ideation about suicide, ah, is an additional miscellaneous risk factor. I think it's important to mention, in summarizing this, this, ah, section of the videotape on assessing risk, that what's important is l, is looking for a pattern or clustering of clues. Uhm, it would be atypical that one clue in isolation would lead us to believe that someone is highly suicidal. Uhm, I also wanna reiterate what I said at the outset that ge, even with all these risk factors that had been written about and researched by many, many people, it remains extremely difficult to predict suicide. The reason it's so hard for us to do that goes back to the notion of ambivalence that the person has. They don't even know whether they're gonna do this. How are we gonna be able to figure out if they're gonna do it or not. So, I, I think it's very important to remember that it's a difficult thing to predict, but there are things that we can utilize, there are tools we can utilize to raise the probability, uhm, of making an accurate prediction. Ah, for me, if I had to choose the, the two on here that I feel are probably most important, ah, one would be how they respond to the question of "Have you been feeling so badly lately you've thought about harming yourself?" What they and how they say it. Uhm, I know quite a few suicidologists that believe that that single factor is the most important thing in trying to assess whether someone is gonna attempt or not, and I also think a history of attempting, uhm, is a very, very important factor, uhm, to be aware of in terms of assessing the risk. So, that's a summary, a handouts B and C, in terms of assessing suicidal risk. Handout D leads us to our next topic which is intervention, uhm, in terms of suicide. Ah, under intervention, I'm gonna say a brief word about prevention, and I'm also gonna say a brief word about postvention(ph), but the major focus here is gonna be intervention counseling with the suicidal person. But before I talk about that, I wanna say a little, a, a little bit about prevents. I'm a strong believer in suicide prevention workshops, uhm, the data is somewhat equivocal on their effectiveness, though I think it's very hard to measure that. And the reason I say that is, ah, if I go out next week and do a suicide prevention workshop at one of our local high schools here, uhm, there may be some people in that workshop who don't go out and attempt suicide, who might have otherwise done it, but, we'll never really know that for sure. It's hard to measure that kind of thing. But, in my opinion, uhm, suicide prevention workshops are very, very important. Uhm, I think it's important to get this topic out in the open more. Uhm, I think it's much more out in the open than it used to be. Ah, certainly in my lifetime, I'd like to see it out in the open even more. Ah, when we do suicide prevention workshops and we do them on a variety of venues, ah, schools, colleges, ah, community, agencies, churches, there usually are three parts to that prevention workshop. What are the warning signs? What should you do if you're concerned about someone? And, what are the local resources? They typically last forty-five minutes, uhm, they're very succinct, ah, hopefully succinct into the point, and again, they focus on those three areas; risk factors, what can you do if you're concerned about someone, any directory of local resources. So, one of the things I wanna make a, uhm, of kind of a pitch for in this videotape is, ah, any of you that are, ah, interested in the topic, and, and, ah, interested in doing a prevention outreach, I think doing these kinds of workshops can make a significant difference in my opinion, uhm, in terms of the suicide rate, in terms of people attempting. I think that the workshops are important with any age group. I think they're especially important, ah, with young people. One of the reasons that I do so many of these workshops, ah, is kind of my way of giving back to my friend, ah, who ended his life. Perhaps, if there had been a suicide prevention workshop, perhaps, it might have made some kind of an impact, uhm, in his situation. So, I'm a great believer in suicide prevention. Uhm, I think it's hard to measure the effects directly but, but I do believe that, ah, getting the topic out on the table and talking about it and educating people about it, ah, is a good thing to do. Secondly, under intervention is the actual idea of counseling with a suicidal person. And, I need to start by saying, ah, unfortunately, that, how you counsel with a suicide person is going to depend, it's gonna depend on your theoretical, ah, orientation. So, if you're, uhm, more analytic or dynamic in your approach, you may work with a suicidal person very differently than if you are a cogni-behavioral therapist, or behavior therapist, or an adlerian. So, it does depend, there's not a panacea, there's not one simple(ph) way that we work with suicidal clients, but summarized, uhm, on a Roman Numeral II on handout D, ah, what, for me, are some of the, ah, most important possible ways in intervening, ah, with a suicidal client and doing counseling with a suicidal client. I'm not gonna go through each of them, I think, ah, several of them are fairly self-explanatory. But, I do wanna highlight a few of them on that list that I think are especially, uhm, important. Letter A, the relationship and ventilation, uhm, in my opinion, getting the person in for counseling is a key. If we can get them to come in, not always, but often, uhm, we can help them, we can help them get through the crisis and keep them alive. The challenge is getting them to come in. So, I, I think it's really important not to underestimate, ah, the value of the therapeutic-alliance, therapeutic-relationship, and having them in the psychotherapeutic process. I think that's very important. I worry much more about people who are suicidal, who are not in treatment than I do people who are in treatment. There certainly is possible for people in treatment to attempt and complete(ph). Uhm, I think it's significantly less likely than for someone who is not in treatment. I wanna emphasize, ah, letter D. Ah, what is the person trying to say with their behavior and how else can they say it? Uhm, the evidence is pretty strong that many suicidal people are trying to say something with their suicidal behavior often, again, not always but often what they're trying to say is, "Help, I need help," about something. And so the obvious implication of that is if we can help them learn in psychotherapy other ways of asking for help, besides threatening or attempting or completing suicide, ah, we may be able to make some kind of impact in terms of their suicidal risk. Letter E, mitigating the hopelessness and helplessness. I talked about hopelessness and helplessness at the beginning, if we can somehow impact that in psychotherapy, ah, the hopeless aspect and the helpless, that sometimes can make a difference in terms of counseling. Letter F is life maintenance agreements uhm, often known, still often known as contracts, the terminology, uhm, is changing, uhm, quite a bit right now. Ah, but the basic idea here is that if we get concerned about someone actively being suicidal, we attempt to have them make an agreement with us that they will not harm themselves. This is also known as, ah, no-harm contracts, contracts in general life maintenance agreements. Ah, they come in a variety of forms, but the essential components of them most often are that the person will agree not to harm themselves for some specified amount of time and the therapist agrees to try to work with the person, to help them help themselves and get better in improving therapy, uhm, most often that therapist and the client both sign the contract and a copy of the contracts stays in the file and the client takes a copy of the contract with him or herself . Uhm, again, I need to mention that there is some controversy about contracts. Uhm, when you look at the literature there, it, it's somewhat equivocal. Ah, there are people who believe that there is not firmed evidence. Uhm, that they're effective. Uhm, my own opinion is that most of the time, they are effective. I u, I've used them many, many times, ah, knock on wood, I have, I've never had any anyone, ah, successfully completed suicide, though I have had a number of people who attempted. Uhm, I do personally believe in them, I think they have value, it's obviously important not to use them in isolation or as the only intervention. So, again e, e, you know, to be fair, I wanna mention that they are, there are differences of opinion about them. Uhm, in my judgments, ah, there are good things to do. Uhm, Medication Letter H is certainly often used with depression, the danger with medications is we're maybe putting a weapon into the person's hands so they need to be monitored, ah, very carefully. Hospitalization is certainly used, uhm, in crisis situations for suicide. Ah, for quite a few suicidologists, and this is kinda of a general rule for me, uhm, if a client will not, ah, contract or sign a life maintenance agreement for a period of 24 hours, uhm, I'm gonna really seriously start thinking then about, ah, the possibility of hospitalization. Again, there's differences of opinion about when we hospitalized, ah, but that, that's kind of a demarcation point for quite a few people in the field. Uhm, what I wanna do at this point, in order to illustrate that phenomenon, kind of in order to illustrate several things we've been talking about in terms of, uhm, assessment of risk, uhm, making an intervention, getting concerned about a client and contract and, uhm, we're gonna interject now a short, about a 10-minute vignette to illustrate, ah, how a therapist might behave if he or she were concerned about a client being suicidal, uhm, what they might do and how they might invoke the idea of a life maintenance agreement, ah, or contract, so we're gonna take a look at that, ah, vignette, ah, and then I'll be back to continue this discussion of, ah, counseling with a suicidal person. 

00:39:10
JOHN S. WESTEFELD  So, Jay, tell me a little more about this depression that you have been experiencing recently. 

00:39:20
JAY  Well, I guess it just has been difficult which is a, I mean, graduate school is one thing and it's always been manageable, ah, but my escape from sort of graduate school was always, ah, being able to maintain athletics and... (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Right. 

00:39:45
JAY ...involved in athletics. And, and, you know, through college, I played a lot of tennis and all that sort of stuff. And the last couple of weeks, I developed a shoulder injury and I've had to stop playing tennis completely, ah, for a while. And so, as that was happening, thing's gone a little bit overwhelming at school and there was no real retreat from here, no real... (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Right. 

00:40:10
JAY ...like method of relaxation through something like tennis to, to escape from that really. And so I'd come home from a lot of intense work at school not being able to physically do much... (crosstalk) 

00:40:30
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Right. 

00:40:30
JAY ...because of the shoulder and I just, I have nothing to do and nothing to think about except for being overwhelmed. 

00:40:40
JOHN S. WESTEFELD And it sounds like based on what you're telling me now and what you were telling me earlier that this overwhelming feeling has been pretty immobilizing for you. 

00:40:50
JAY Uh hmm. 

00:40:50
JOHN S. WESTEFELD But tell me a little more about that i, immobilizing in what way? 

00:40:55
JAY Well, I mean, exactly what it is. It's just not being able to move physically and not feeling like I wanna move emotionally. 

00:41:05
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Okay. 

00:41:05
JAY There's just, there's no reason for me to get up. I come home from school and whatever it is, 10, 10 to 15 hours at school, and I just stay at home, I just, I sit there and I'm watching things on TV and that's fine, but that only lasts so long and it's even more frustrating because, you know, I try to pay attention to do as much, of the tennis world and what's going on out there, but yet when I watch highlights or something like that, it reminds me of... (crosstalk) 

00:41:35
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Right. 

00:41:35
JAY ...like you can't do that. (crosstalk) 

00:41:35
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Right. 

00:41:35
JAY So, there's this constant cues that I receive saying this is gonna be a lot harder than you realize. 

00:41:45
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Right. 

00:41:45
JAY And it just leaves me still or frozen like, really helpless. 

00:41:50
JOHN S. WESTEFELD  Okay but let me ask you this, uhm, have this feelings ever gotten to a point, have you ever, ah, felt so overwhelmed, so immobilized that you thought about harming yourself in any way? 

00:42:05
JAY  Well. 

00:42:10
[sil.] 

00:42:10
JAY Yeah, I guess like last week or so. Uhm, it got to the point where I just couldn't take it anymore. I just, I knew that this injury was gonna put me out for at least three, four months... (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
JOHN S. WESTEFELD  Right. 

00:42:40
JAY ...or something and this is, at the same time when the school was really intense and I've just figured like it would be much easier if I didn't have to do any other stuff... (crosstalk) 

00:42:50
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Hmm. 

00:42:50
JAY ...I don't have to deal with the school and I didn't have to wait out the months for the injury to recover 'coz I couldn't do anything about it. 

00:43:00
JOHN S. WESTEFELD All right. 

00:43:00
JAY Well, I got like worry about if I didn't have to deal with it and just. (crosstalk) 

00:43:05
JOHN S. WESTEFELD  But it sounds like du, during that situation, you were fairly actively thinking about harming yourself or is that overstating it? 

00:43:20
JAY No that's, that's accurate, I mean that's, I got pretty close, I mean, as close as one could get without doing it. And I, I sort of like this is like that Saturday or whatever, uhm, you know, Saturday night when I just drove like out to the train tracks whatever, and it was late at night. This was about, I don't know, maybe like midnight or 1:00 AM. And I drove my car out there... (crosstalk) 

00:43:50
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Right. 

00:43:50
JAY ...and thought like, okay, well, all I have to do is either drive onto the tracks or sit there and all of this would be gone. 

00:44:10
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Do, do you know what kept you from doing it that night? 

00:44:15
JAY To be honest, no, I don't. 

00:44:15
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Did something happened for, for whatever reason, you decided to keep living that night? 

00:44:25
JAY Yeah, and for whatever reason, I just stayed in the car. 

00:44:25
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Uh hmm. But it's, it also sounds like in terms of where we are right now, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:44:30
JAY Uh-hmm. 

00:44:30
JOHN S. WESTEFELD that you're saying to me that you feel like there is somewhat the risk here that you might harm yourself? 

00:44:40
JAY Well, 'coz I don't know, I don't know if that thought will happen again. 

00:44:40
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Right. 

00:44:40
JAY And if it does, I don't know, I don't know if I will stay in the car that time. 

00:44:45
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Okay. Well, I'll tell you, Jay, as I'm listening to you, and, ah, talk about this and the experience you're talking about right now. I, I feel like in my judgment, at least, the, the, there is some degree of risk here that you might try to harm yourself and that's something that I really do not want you do. Uhm, and so one of the things I wanted to ask you today was, would you be willing, uhm, in order to try to help you get through this crisis and survive what you're dealing with right now, get to a better place and improve, would you be willing to make an agreement with me, uhm, that during our work together at least for that amount of time that we're seeing each other in, in the therapy that you will not harm yourself. Is that something you think you could agree to? 

00:45:35
JAY  No, I can't, okay. I can't. The, there's just, I can't guarantee anything. I don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow. 

00:45:50
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Okay. That feels like something that you, you, you're just not sure that, that you could follow through on that. (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
JAY I mean, ah, I mean, I, I, I, I can understand it but I can't, that's not something I can... (crosstalk) 

00:46:00
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Okay. 

00:46:00
JAY  actually commit to you right now. I, I don't know what's gonna happen in the days or weeks. 

00:46:10
JOHN S. WESTEFELD I understand. Do, do you think you could commit to not harm yourself, uhm, for the next month? 

00:46:15
JOHN S. WESTEFELD  Even that it sounds like it, it, it feels like too much to make kind of a blanket agreement not to harm yourself, it's like you could do it for some period of time for, for a month to allow us to do some work together and try to make things better. 

00:46:30
[sil.] 

00:46:30
JAY No, like, I mean, a month is a long time, I, I don't know how long that I'm gonna be dealing this injury for and how intense school is going to get. It's like four, four-plus weeks from now. I, I just don't know, like, I don't know what will happen. 

00:46:55
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Well you know, as of right now, we're scheduled to see each other again in a week, do you feel like you could make that agreement to not harm yourself for the next week until you come in for your next appointment in a week? Would that feel like it's something that, that you could agree to? 

00:47:20
[sil.] 

00:47:20
JAY  No. I mean, I, I can't, I, I it just seems to me that right now, things are on a day-to-day basis. I do, I can't commit to anything for a week. 

00:47:45
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Uh hmm. Well, given y, you know, the, the idea that it, things may really feel like a day-to-day basis. (crosstalk) 

00:47:50
JAY Uh hmm. 

00:47:50
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Let me ask you this. Uhm, how would you feel about our scheduling and appointment for you for tomorrow 24 hours from now and making an agreement with me that you will not harm yourself between now and that appointment tomorrow, that you will, in fact, show up for that appointment tomorrow? Does that feel like something that you could agree to? Does that feel doable reason? 

00:48:15
JAY Like, about the same time tomorrow? 

00:48:15
JOHN S. WESTEFELD  Ah, whate, whatever time we could get a schedule but the, the agreement would be that, that we would see each other, we would set an appointment for some time tomorrow... (crosstalk) 

00:48:25
JAY Uh hmm. 

00:48:25
JOHN S. WESTEFELD ...and that you would essentially be promised me that you'll show up for that appointment, that we would contract, that you would agree not to harm yourself between now and showing up for that appointment tomorrow? 

00:48:40
[sil.] 

00:48:40
JAY Well, I guess like if it's just one day. 

00:49:00
JOHN S. WESTEFELD  If it's just one day? 

00:49:05
JAY Yeah. If it's just one day, I can, I can promise that I'll be here tomorrow. 

00:49:15
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Are you sure? 

00:49:15
JAY Yeah. 

00:49:15
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Can you give me a word on that? 

00:49:20
JAY Yeah. 

00:49:20
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Okay. One of the things that, that I like to do with this kind of agreement which is sometimes called contract and it's sometimes called a life maintenance agreement. 

00:49:30
JAY Uh hmm. 

00:49:30
JOHN S. WESTEFELD But, but I'd like to, to actually put it in writing. I, I found that, uhm, it helps if, if we can put it in writing and I can keep a copy of it here and you can actually take a copy of it with you. Uhm, we both sign it and it, it's really a pledge that, that you are going to show up for that appointment tomorrow and not harm yourself and then I'm gonna do everything I can to try and help you get better, help you help yourself to improve and make things better in life. And so, what I'd liked to do if you're okay with this, uhm, is actually go get a copy of that contract and bring it in, uhm, have you looked at it and if, if it looks okay to you, and it's basically that agreement that I just described. Uhm, we'll both sign it and we'll both abide by it. Would it be okay? 

00:50:15
JAY  Yeah. 

00:50:20
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Are you sure? 

00:50:20
JAY Yeah. I mean, I can, I can come into that very, very day. 

00:50:25
JOHN S. WESTEFELD Okay. What I'm gonna do then, uhm, sit tight, I'm gonna get the contract and I'll be right back, okay? 

00:50:30
JAY Okay. 

00:50:30
JOHN S. WESTEFELD  One of the things I think you, ah, may have noticed in that vignette is that I had to, ah, use, uhm, a technique where I would change the time frame of the contract and so we started out, what I often do is, start out with kind of a universal where your contract or sign a life maintenance agreement in general for our work together. If the person won't, ah, we start back in the timeframe back, ah, to earlier and earlier periods. And as indicated in vignette with Jay, ah, he was wanted to contract for 24 hours. If he had not been willing to do that, I would have seriously thought at that point then about, uhm, ah, hospitalization. Some other things I wanna mention on the, ah, handout related to counseling with a suicidal person. Ah, later Jay, ah, you'll see listed there spirituality slash religion but only if appropriate. I have this on the list because I've had clients where in my judgment, their spiritual or belief system whatever it was, whatever it was, was a significant part of their life. Ah, it was a positive force in their life, and sometimes they would report that when becoming depressed or suicidal, ah, that would drop out of their life. Ah, they would stop, ah, being involved in, in that part of their, uhm, ah, their life. And for those people, I found sometimes getting them back, involving that, ah, has been a very important part of their, ah, treatment, of improving, of getting better, ah, and then there's, of course, there are other clients that, first of all, ah, where belief, our religious belief system has no role at all whatsoever in their life. So it's gonna depend a lot on the client. Ah, Letter L refers to more frequent contact and emergency (inaudible ) of access. Ah, what is meant there is that it was suicidal clients, of course, ah, the very pivotal idea is the notion that they need access to treatment. Ah, so when we're seeing people that are suicidal, ah, typically if they are in contract or not, if they're actively suicidal, ah, in whatever venue that may be, uhm, it's important that we consider the possibility of seeing them more often than once a week. Then there's a lot of clinical judgment here. If I were to have to say the most typical thing I've done is, is with somebody that I'm pretty concerned about. I'm gonna probably see them twice a week and I'm also gonna try to make one of those sessions be on a Friday because it's been my experience that, ah, people who are depressed and/or suicidal, there, there's often concern about going into the weekend that, that activates a lot of, ah, concern. But in general, I would say we may have more frequent contact than once a week and secondly, they need to be crystal clear on their emergency access, uhm, plan so we want them to know if you become actively suicidal, if you're worried about breaking your contract, if you get concerned between sessions, here's what I want you to do. And, you know, that may ran, depending on where you work and your situation, ah, professionally that may be, ah, presenting themselves at the hospital emergency room or calling a crisis center or calling you or calling an on-call number. The, the point is, though, there needs to be no ambiguity about what the client is going to do between sessions if they start getting concerned about the fact that, ah, there's been an activation of a very high level of suicidal, ah, threat. Letter O, monitor risk in an ongoing way, ah, that's important, I think, to emphasize that, ah, we may initially get the situation under control with somebody who may be suicidal, but we need to continue to check in with them, uhm, you know, not to badger them, not to hound them about it, but to check in with them on a regular basis about their suicidal risk level, not to assume that just because it's been dealt within the first session, that is gonna stay the same, ah, throughout the time that were, ah, working with them. Ah, I think the rest of them, ah, under Roman numeral two are fairly self-explanatory. Uhm, again the, the big picture for me is getting them into treatment, establishing a therapeutic alliance of relationship, ah, trying to figure out what they're saying with their behavior, uhm, the possibility of hospitalization if necessary and medication, contracting. And I would say one, ah, final comment, ah, on this section, uhm, it seems to be the case that, ah, you know, there're a lot of different, ah, therapeutic approaches that are used with depression and suicidal people. As I indicate with Letter K here, cognitive behavioral therapy, ah, that realm of psychotherapy tends to, ah, in my view and in the view of many people have the best track record in terms of working with people who are depressed. The empirical evidence seems to be pretty strong. So, I would offer that up certainly not as the only theoretical approach but one that has pretty good data, uhm, of effectiveness. Ah, finally, I wanna say a word about postvention Roman numeral III here. Ah, at the time that, ah, my friend died, uhm, 40 years ago, we didn't really have such a thing as postvention where you know at now. The term really didn't exist the way we have it now. Postvention of course is going in after a suicide and working with the survivors, uhm, people that are in that person's world. It's been my experience that, ah, most people who know someone who is suicidal, uhm, very much need some kind of place to talk about that experience, the process, the experience of having gone through that. We, we refer to these folks as survivors, I'm a survivor. Uhm, many of you may be survivors. And so there are variety of ways. These can happen of course and it's beyond the purview of this video to go into those. Ah, what I wanna say about that, though, is that, ah, what I think is important is that there'd be some opportunity if the person wants to, ah, to talk about the experience of having someone close to them, feel themselves, so that may be in a group venue, it may be individual counseling, it may be with friends or family, it may be in spiritual situation, it maybe in some kind of organized situation. Ah, for example, in a college campus, if it happened in a sorority, a team may, might come in and do a postvention, ah, with the members of the sorority, it can happen in a variety of ways. The main point I wanna make is I think it's important. Uhm, I think, ah, in my experience, ah, counseling and psychotherapy can be very helpful to people who have gone through this. Uhm, I've, I had people come to see me literally who have come in and said, ah, 25 years ago, my dad killed himself and I think I'm ready to deal with it now, so, and I've had people come in the next day and everything in between. And so, ah, the time at which somebody maybe ready to talk about it or process it can vary a great deal but the concept of postvention, ah, be it either an individual venue or in a group or in a workshop, uhm, I think its very, very important so I wanted to include it here at least in terms of mentioning it. All right that's a, kind of a summary in terms of, ah, suicidal intervention including prevention and postvention. Ah, the last thing I wanna do on the videotape is I wanna talk a little about resources. Ah, there are out there. There are tremendous number of resources, literally hundreds of them, ah, on the topic of suicide, and of course we today, in this one-hour video, can only very briefly touch on some of the key points related to, ah, suicide and its, ah, assessment and intervention. 

00:58:05
JOHN S. WESTEFELD  I wanna mention, uhm, at the risk of certainly leaving out some great organization so that I, I wanna mention one that I think in my opinion is the most used, one and most important organization, is the American Association of Suicidology located in Washington, D.C. Ah, they have an excellent, ah, website, and just go to, ah, any search engine and enter American Association of Suicidology, you'll find it. Ah, this organization, uhm, does a lot of great things. Uhm, it's very involved in the publication of the journal, ah, suicide and life threatening behaviors, the journal many people consider to be the leading journal in suicide. Ah, they host an annual convention and it's a really interesting convention because it's made up both of, ah, professionals in the field from a w, wide variety of discipline. So, ah, counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists, ah, psychiatric nurses, clergy people, a variety of, ah, professionals who work in the field of suicide, but it's also made up of survivors. Survivors attend this convention. Again, defining survivor as people who have, uhm, been close to someone who has attempted or completed suicide or possibly even people who have attempted. And so at the convention, there are both, ah, quote, “professional presentations” going on but there are also, ah, support groups going on for survivors, meetings for survivors, opportunities for survivors to talk to each other, uhm, about, ah, how they have attempted to deal with their loss and the experience. Uhm, so the convention, I think, is, is an, an excellent resource, and on the website, there's a lot of information about that annual convention. Uhm, the American Association of Suicidology, known as AAS, also has a huge, ah, publication outlet, they have newsletters, they have, ah, monographs, ah, books, pamphlets, ah, an incredible number of resources, ah, that I think can be very, very useful, ah, to people who are dealing with suicide in any way, again, whether it's from a professional standpoint, uhm, or a personal, ah, standpoint. So there are many, many great organizations out there. I highlight this one, ah, only because it's the one that, you know, in my own, ah, life and career I've used very extensively, ah, both as a survivor myself but also as a psychologist. Uhm, I referred many people to their website and their website, ah, again has a tremendous amount of information. And so, uhm, if you would like to go way beyond what we could possibly cover, ah, in this videotape today, I would, ah, encourage you to, ah, examine that website, ah, and draw the information from there that, ah, may be useful to you. I wanna co, ah, conclude by saying it's, ah, ah, been very meaningful for me to, ah, involve in making this videotape. As I said at the beginning, ah, this is a topic that is, ah, ah, very personal topic for me, and a lot of my career has been dedicated, ah, again, I think going back to my friend, uhm, in trying to, ah, get this topic out in the open more, educate people about it, ah, teach, ah, both lay people and professionals about how we can, ah, prevent suicide. Ah, what we can do to help people who are suicidal, ah, and what we can do after a suicide, uhm, in terms of postvention. Ah, hopefully, ah, for those of you watching the videotape, ah, you will be able to draw, ah, from one or more of those areas and whether you're a survivor or whether you're working in the field, ah, I hope that some of what we've talked about on the videotape today and some of what is, ah, down in the handout, ah, will be useful to you. Thank you.
