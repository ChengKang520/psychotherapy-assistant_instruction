00:00:00
JEAN HOUSTON Good afternoon everybody. 

00:00:00
UNKNOWN Good afternoon. 

00:00:00
JEAN HOUSTON How are you feeling? 

00:00:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:00:05
JEAN HOUSTON Good. Not too bad for an old party. Good. I don't see too many-- ah, everybody is looking for things upfront. Well, we have people's laps, you could do that. Uhm, years ago, well, 1990, 1991, I was working in India and I happened to be in a very, ah,-- you can't hear me? I'd have to turn in my badge. All right. Now, tell me if I go like this, you can't hear me, is that right? If I drop my voice. And so, I have to keep projecting, uhm-hmm? Can you hear me all right back there? Yes? Anytime you can't hear me, don't scream out, just wave your hand like that, make yourself utterly fascinating. And then, I will know. Anyway, I was in India and I was in a, uhm, a village which there are more 600,000 in India. On a Sunday, which was the time in which-- every Sunday for about 18 to 30 weeks, I think it was, the great myth of India was playing, the Ramayana. How many of you know the Ramayana? The Ramayana which is the story of Prince Rama and his beloved wife, Princess? 

00:01:35
UNKNOWN Sita. 

00:01:35
JEAN HOUSTON Sita, Sita. And how they were be trait of their kingdom and how, ah, they were went to live in the forest for 14 years, and they were idyllic, they have a lovely time except Ravana, the 10-headed demon of Sri Lanka, came and abducted her, took her off to Sri Lanka. And then, of course, since huge, horrible battles, some of them led by the sainted monkey king, Hanuman. And eventually, she is rescued and she comes back, and she asserts she never sat on, on Ravana's laps. So, she's accepted for a while. Now, this is the core story of India. I mean, you see it in every taxi drivers, you know, there's a picture from it, you see it in schools, you see it painted on the walls, it is the core story, story. The perfect Hindu wife who obeys her husband and all things, and the strong handsome viral, ah, Rama. While we're sitting on the ground, because the, the television set is in the tree, one television set, and it's in the tree-- let me find out-- we'll get rid of these things here. And, ah, and people come in and they tie up the water buffalo and, ah, they sit down. And this glorious segment begins. By the way, there's a lot of feedback, do you hear lot of feedback? Friends, engineers, engineers, geniuses, technological Merlins, yeah, we've got to-- are you fixing it? Okay. Thank you. All right. 

00:03:35
[sil.] 

00:03:40
JEAN HOUSTON Try again. Oh, that's better. Okay. It's funny. Oh, this mind power and all this technology. Anyway... 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN No, no, no. 

00:03:50
JEAN HOUSTON No. 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN Is that better. 

00:03:55
JEAN HOUSTON Better? 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:03:55
JEAN HOUSTON No. Better? Okay. All right. So, uhm, everybody pray to whoever you believe in. But, you know, if I came downstairs, would it be better? I don't know. We'll gonna try everything. Your therapist, you know, who, you try everything. All right, how was this? Well, they don't have to see me. I'm just-- okay. Uhm, can you hear me from here? Oh, that is actually better because I have that-- and don't worry-- oh, they have gone that too. All right. So, everybody is watching this delicious program. 

00:04:50
[sil.] 

00:04:55
JEAN HOUSTON Now, you stay. Stay cool, okay? Not talk to us. You know, if only the gods came through and those hotspots would not be lovely. All right. So, everybody is watching this magnificent thing and I think it, "Oh, this is gorgeous, the costumes, the songs, the dances, the invocations." I mean, it was really glorious. When the old Brahman lady, who owned the one television set, turned to me and said, "Oh, I don't like Princess Sita, she is much too passive. We, women in India were much stronger than that. We have to change the story." I said, "Madame, the story is at least 3,000 years old." "That's right, it's out of date. We have to change it." She said, "Sita, she should be having something to do with their own rest schools instead of bowling and complaining, waiting for Rama. My name is Sita, very common in India. My husband's name is Rama. He is a lazy bum. Anything happen I have to rescue him. We have to change the story." And then, she began to talk with the people who-- Gujarati run. And they were all agreeing and I'm so shocked. I mean, the core story of India. "We have to change the story. Women in India we're much stronger, we have to have a much better example." And they were-- I mean, listening to them agree, it was like listening to a group of fundy baptists in Mississippi rewriting the gospel of Mark. I mean, that was the level of it. Well, after his glorious performance, ah, what comes downloaded from the satellite? Dynasty. I was so embarrassed. Sister-- she said, "Why are you so embarrassed? Can you not, it is the same story." "How can you say that?" "You got the good lady, you got the bad lady, you got the good man. But, when you got a good versus evil, yes, indeed, it is a same story." But what was happening was the changing of the myth, a myth ancient beyond ancient, probably, 4 or 5,000 years old. True of its kind. And the shifting of it because women's rules were shifting, and this is something that is happening in mythic structures all over the world. The story is changing. And yet, the story is deeply embedded. You know, some of you know Joe Campbell? Joe Campbell and I worked together for 20 years. We did all kinds of seminars. Some of you may have been in some of them. Is anybody in here have been in our seminars? Yes. Yeah. It is about 10 people. And we did all kinds of work. But, uhm, at one point he said, "Jean, why don't you go out and interview children who have not been exposed to radio or television, and not even been read to? See what story is they tell." So, I did. It was hard to find them, but I found a few. They tended to live on farms and their parents were so busy, they had had very little event story telling. Here's an example of what happened. Little Jimmy, 3 years old. "Jimmy, tell me a story." "I don't know any stories." "But tell me a story, anyway." "Okay." "Okay." "What kind of story?" "A new story, a new story." "Okay." "Okay." "Huh, once upon a time there was a little boy..." "Oh, that's nice." "And he had a mommy..." "Oh, that's nice." "And he loves his mommy..." "Uhm-hmm." "And he married his mom." "What happened next?" "They had many babies." "And then what happened?" "I don't remember, I go play with doggie." "No, no, you come back. Jimmy, come back here. Come here, you stay. What happened next?" "People got married him." "What happened next?" "He went away." "Who did he go with?" "His sister." "And what happened next?" "He, he, he, he talked to everybody, he helped them." "And what happened next?" "Then, everybody liked him again, I go play with doggie." And I was thinking of the ending of that great Jewish joke which go-- the punch line is, Oedipus, schmoedipus, as long as he loves his mother. 

00:10:05
[sil.] 

00:10:10
JEAN HOUSTON This child was telling us Oedipus Rex, but he was telling it in its foremost because, ah, the story of Oedipus does not end as it does in the formal Oedipus Rex, where Oedipus discovers that he has married his mother and killed his father, and had his own children and he puts out his eyes, and goes off-- and goes off led by his daughter/sister whose name was? It have to be classical edu-- what? Antigone. Not Electra, no, that's another kind of story. But, anyway, Antigone. And he becomes wise in the ways of the world and people come up to him and say, "Oedipus, you, who have suffered so much and have committed the ultimate taboo, you, I contrast you, I can tell everything." And Oedipus becomes the wisest of beings. And then in Sophocles late play, that he wrote somewhere between '90 and '95 to prove he still had a mind, it was not and nothing about Alzheimer's, okay?. In Oedipus at Colonus talks about the rest of the story where Oedipus comes to Colonus and there is the great priest king of Theseus who says, "Welcome great man, you, who have suffered so much and have so much wisdom be for us the wise man. Oh, please, stay." And Oedipus says, "Thank you, I will." But the gods, who, we now have all sounded like NoÃ«l Coward, said, "Oh, what happened to the people down there, they're getting frightfully, frightfully." You know intelligent and, and, you know-- oh, we need a therapist. We have too many problems, we need Oedipus. Big earthquake, Oedipus is taken off and Oedipus becomes a god, and that's the full story. And that's the story essentially that little boy was telling me. Well, to be ran into this once or twice, that's one thing. But when you run into it, you know, seven or eight, or nine times, variations, not that story but other stories, you realize that, younger one was probably right, that these mythic tales are organs of the human Psyche and that we all contain them. Back when I was in my early 20s, uhm-hmm, I had the only legal supply of LSD in New York City, I was very popular. And, and I was doing the government research on the effects of LSD in human personality. But we, we did it. But when you prepare people from months and-- of set-- and setting, it was not a great deal of amnesty. But, anyway, uhm, we found-- no, no, no, no, not yet, thank you. No, no, no sound, no song, supposed, thank you. And the one singing up, that's an old Israeli song the Wise Man and the Foolish Man, shows where I am. Anyway-- ah, oh, what we would find is that beneath the surface cross of consciousness, people were just filled with this mythic structures, stories. I mean, people who had no business doing these things would come out with these rip-roaring stories. I mean, it was-- it was-- it is as if there are patterns of great stories that are within us, whether they occur in dreams or fantasies, or just telling us from the collective unconsciousness, let's say, they are part of our equipment which is why when Joe Campbell encourage me, when I was very young, to really study myth at deeper levels and to tap into the mythic matrix of humankind, I did so. And I've written a lot of books on the subject. But, one of the things about myth, a myth is the coded essence of the storyline of your life, it is not like a fairytale. Fairytales are often collapsed myths, but fairytales are important. When I was about 8, I was at P.S. 6 in Manhattan. Anyone of you know P.S. 6 in Manhattan? Anybody go there? Oh, it was the great school, it was-- we were encouraged to do all kind and live like Indians, go and meet the great elders of the time. And one of the people that we were taken to meet was Albert Einstein. And it's-- well, it gets better. So, we show up. And he's very sweet and very vague, and has a lot of hair, has a blue sock on and the red sock, very sweet. One of the smart ally KID says, "Mr. Einstein, how can we become as smart as you?" He said, "Read fairytales." We didn't like that answer, you know. "Well, how can we become smarter than you?" "Read more fairytales." By which he meant the fairytales would activate. Not just imagination but some aspect of the collective unconscious from which the whole creative energy and pattern emerges, which is what he did himself. So, and the imagination seems to take us to the realm of the imaginal decoding, is that is, the, the imaginal essence of the caterpillar is the butterfly, great higher coding. The imaginal cells get together and the mush, that is the, uhm, caterpillar in the form of the ma-- ah, ah, manifestation of its higher form. Myths often serve to activate the imaginal essence within ourselves so that we may emerge into the next state, the next state. We are meeting links, all of us. And we contain the coded genius of millennia within us. And you don't have to work very far to get to it, you don't have to take LSD, you don't even have to go into trans, or sometimes that happens. I used to put Joseph-- ah, ah, I used to have met Joseph Campbell. It was very interesting. I would because I thought, "Oh, boy, hot damn, I'm gonna be at front row sit on myth." And I've taken deepened, deepened and deepened. Do you know all the stupid things I did in that sit? And I would say, "Joe, who are you, deeply down." And he would say, "Yes?" "What do you see?" "Nothing." "What do you mean you see nothing?" "I've never seen an image, I'm one of the 5% of the population who has never seen an image." And I go, "How dare you, how dare you, write about myth and simply, you don't even see images?" "I'm kinesthetic." He was-- he was a great athlete, I feel it. So, you notice his book is called the Hero's Journey, it is not the hero simply, because that is how the myth was transduced in its extremely athletic, very physicalized existence. You see? Now, we are on the time of the rising of the myths, why? Why not? Because we are in a time-- as I said earlier in one of my talks, we are in the time of mythical whole system transition where everything is on the ground, it is the-- it is the momentum behind the drama of the world. And that's why the mythic structures are changing. What do they have to do? They have to do with the rising of women in full partnership with men in the halt of native human affairs with horrible backlash. That's what's happening. Yes, all over the world. It is the cataclysm of the-- of the old ways of being. So, it's about women are in the myth taking major roles, it is about and not just they're being rescued. It's about men and women, and children of all ethnicities. And what is the goal? Is it to find the beloved, or the quest? Well, yes. But the beloved and the quest tends to be the planted Earth herself. So, these are ways of the mythic structure are changing. And it's also about a cosmic agenda as we discovered that we do not just live in the universe but the universe lives in us. Those incredible pictures that come to us from the Hubble telescopes are telling us that we are cosmic stuff. We're not just the latest product of the metabolism of the galaxy, we are galactic agents, ourselves. So, whether you believe what the ETs are real or not, doesn't make any difference, we are also the aliens but we are also the cosmic beings, you see it? Now, I wrote a book called the Wizard of Oz which got to be very popular because Oprah liked it. Oprah identified totally with are they, who do you identify and those were Dorothy? She said, "I don't know." And I can see this little black girl with pigtails, that's Dorothy. Uhm, because she, herself, has had a journey through us so, we had a very-- any-- have you see that? It was in a Super Soul Sunday. Have you-- you see-- Danny, have you seen that? Yeah. That was-- it was a nice show. Now, why did I choose that story? Because it is a story that prefigured the changing of the mythic adventures of our lives. It is not about one person, it is also a female journey. Why? And Joe Campbell and I used to have long chats about this. He didn't think there was a heroin's journey. I said, "Stop a non-sense." He said, "No, it's blah, blah, blah." But there is, and the Wizard of Oz, it's a classic female journey. She goes with a group. She takes care of them, each way. She takes the scarecrow off the hook. She oils up the tin man. All right? She gives courage to the, the lion. And she is in the state of wonder and astonishment, and acceptance all the way, she doesn't fight what is happening, she just finds a way to deal with it. Her emphasis is on process rather than product on making things go here and develop, and grow. That's why it's a feminine journey. And when then, the ultimate, ah, gift is to be given by the wizard and he refuses, she and her soul mate who is Toto, you know, make sure that the wizard is revealed. And as I said, it turns out to be not much of the wizard but a tremendous psychotherapist. You know, maybe. And she grows him. Everybody who's around are growers. Uhm, the story-- how many of you saw the movie? Let's put it this way, who never saw the movie, the Wizard of Oz? We have a lot of people from-- nobody? My God, I'm so surprised. Anyway, 1939 was the golden age of movies. My dear father wrote some of them, actually. He was working with Bing Crosby and, ah, Bob Hope who wrote the Road shows, road to this, road to those. My father by the way is the man who wrote the joke, Who's on First? No, wait a minute, don't get excited. When I looked at that joke, it's he and two Jewish guys, that's a Talmudic joke, you know. It's got too much irony for a guy who's an agnostic Baptist from Texas. You know, I just don't see how he could have done that. And my father was there that stands people. He was the, ah, comedy goy, cuz comedy wasn't still, it's a Jewish cottage industry in America and my dad was the only non-Jewish, and they'd say, "Hey, Jack, goyish of these jokes, so the hicks in Kansas will understand this, that part of his job. Anyway, 1939, it is the golden age of Hollywood, The Wizard of Oz, what else? Gone with the Wind, Gunga Din, not-- Goodbye, Mr. Chips, The Women, I mean, it is the year in which a full kind of-- was the end of the depression and it was the time in which a kind of sense of hope and possibility in the mythic narrative of America was happening. And so, this very strange interesting happening, the Wizard of Oz occurred. And it is really a story for us in our time in ways that few stories are. It begins in an outmoded situation, Dorothy is living in an absolutely outmoded situation. Nobody takes her seriously. "Auntie Em, Auntie Em..." "Oh, go, OA Dorothy, can't you see where counting our chickens?" The American way of life, you know. Ah, the landscape is just, what? Angular little triangular houses, telephone poles and gray, gray, gray Her Auntie Em and Uncle Henry are gray trying to eke out of miserable existence. And they say, "Why can't you go somewhere where nobody-- where you're not bothering anybody, all of, or me, I could." So, often the myth begins not in under happy circumstances, but in circumstances that say, we have come to an ending time. And we are the beginning of a new time, we are caught in a parenthesis where the end of one era, we are not quite at the beginning of the next one. Yes? But you stay is the state of yearning, and it is the yearning that is so huge that something has to happen. Any of you have ever been in the state of yearning so huge? The things happened is as if the universe says, "Oh, boy, we got a live one there, there." And, of course, in that incredible song, Somewhere Over The Rainbow, which was not going to be put in the picture and find that it ended up in the last minute. Can you sing it? Some... 

00:25:25
UNKNOWN Where over the rainbow. 

00:25:30
JEAN HOUSTON Up high. There's dreams that you dreamed of once in a lullaby. And it goes on and on about where troubles melt like lemon drops away above, and soon they taps there, up fight. It is a story of the other commitment to change. There's a point that is yearning and there's a point beyond yearning was something has to happen where you are in sink with the whole system transition that is trying to happen, trying to take place. And of course, it is going to happen. Rainbows, rainbows, in, in many, many native things, rainbows are the arc between this world and the next world. Rainbows-- ah, I wrote a book about this, one of my books called, ah, Manual for the Peacemaker, where the great peacemaker of the, uhm, Iroquois people standing there in the midst of the spots of rain and the rainbow, and he gives the great sermon that if we, native people, are going to get together we have to-- we, our tribes, to trade through commerce for the clubs, we cannot be fighting each other all the time. We hear about the rainbow people where the time of the great gathering of so many different people fusion cultures, fusions rainbows, and by fusion, I don't mean like the-- at restaurant, there was once in San Francisco called the Genghis Khan, it was Jewish and Chinese. No, I mean, it's a fusion food, fusion ideas, fusion music, fusion called the rainbow, that also takes us between year and the greater there, that gives us the paradox that we are local and encapsulate people in a space-time suit and we are also god in hiding, you know, the rainbow. But, of course, what does it take also? Though, she is in the state of yearning, you have to have the absolute author, complete negativity show up. Have any of you ever had the absolute completely and total negativity show up? Five of you. Yes. All right. And that is Miss Gulch, I mean the gulch that we fall into, the gulch in who, ah, little Toto because in his infinite wisdom had bitten her and she's got him to sheriff to say that he could-- he has to be put away. And, ah, of course, as she puts him away and the, ah, uncle had to do nothing because they can't face to get the one capitalist in the town, cuz, little Toto, he is always free to get out and she knows she has to run away. And who does she run into? The prototype of the wizard and Professor Marvel who is the first new-age figure to appear in the movies, you know, who's a scam artist and a very good man, and who knows that she is in the state of yearning. He want to see big cities, mountains, interesting thing. Huh? He says, "If you could have almost read my mind." How many of you have noticed that the prefigural event, the prefigural person, who is not the right person but is prefigural of what it is that is trying to emerge in your life shows up. Almost like an announcement, bah, bah, bah, bah. And that's what he is, of course, played by the same person in the movie, Frank Mor-- Morgan. So, there is that prefigural event. How many of you now find yourself in a state of noticing synchronicities, coincidences, prefigural of something that is trying to emerge, that is trying to find you in space sometime? Are there any of you there that have there? No? That's why you come here, you know, are you prefigural or are you prefigu-- maybe that follow in the other rooms, but I think, I'll leave the seminar to somebody even more prefigural engine in the next one. Anyway, probably so, too. Anyway, but then, it takes a tornado. Now, the tornado who is something, I've been in tornado so I could say, a tornado can pick up a cow and deposit it a hundred miles away perfectly fine. It can also take a s-- ah, strongly thing and it put right through a tree. It can't be. When it begins, there is like a greenish strangeness to the atmosphere. How many of you have even been in tornados, you know? Oh, yeah, a lot of people, here from Kansas, Illinois, yeah, uhm,-- but it is the enunciation that things are going to change. But some of you divorce, but some illness, but some just call out what it is, what was the tornado? Transition, what else? Loss of job, loss of income, hmm? Injury, yes. Infidelity, yes. Pardon? Death of a baby, death of relatives, death of friends. But it can-- it doesn't always have to be negative, it can be suddenly an incredible opportunity that you don't know and you have a sense of wonder and astonishment and sheared tear over. How many have ever been in that, that state? It can be the death of your profession, or you're sensing your profession, I just spent all of that money with all that therapy and here I am and I, nothing, no, I mean, hopefully, it's not that one, but, but-- however, it happens, it announces the big shift, it kicks you out of the, what? Ordinary world because the extraordinary is in love with you. Because you have been in such a state of yearning and the God say, "There's a live one, but the universe itself." Well, excuse my metaphors, it's quite different from the ones that probably used in this conference, but I don't mess why they brought the along as supposed to be different. Anyway-- no, no, no, no, no. Anyway, uhm, so, of course it comes and, of course, she can't get down into the salary with her relatives because if she did, there would be no story. She would have just ended up as a farm wife eking out of miserable existence in Kansas. How many of you-- chickens, yes. How many of you-- how many of you have found that because something did not occur a great deal other things did? You know, this is-- this is very important and as we look at our story of life, because something that was expected did not occur, something else did or some kind of announcement. For example, in my own life. I grew up in a theatrical family. My mother was Shakespearean actor, my dad was a comedy writer, I, myself, won various New York Critics Award for acting and directing, and when I got out of college, I went immediately to Greece. This is more than like a week, you know, I got out of my college and went to, huh, immediately run off to what I thought was my home sweet home, which was the Temple of Athena and the part a lot. And my friends were with me, said, "Come on, Jean, let's go. Come on, come on, come on, let's go see it." I said, "No, no, I'd come home. You go, you go." They came back three hours later with three telegrams, this is way before faxes and everything else, and they were the lures. And one telegram was been-- was been 20th century fax inviting me to take a seven-year contract, I knew that that went nowhere and ended up and see roles, you know. And the second was from a very great woman, Director Margaret Webster, inviting me to possibly play the lead opposite of Errol Flynn in Jane Eyre. I was a little taller than he, and I didn't think that would work. But the third was from the great New York director, Joseph Papp, inviting me to play the leads in Shakespeare in the park and everything in me, everything that I have been pattered force studied, said, "Yes, hooh." But I definitely leave immediately. And a voice that was so loud, I don't know to this day whether it was from the Temple of Athena or from my own headset, "No." "No? What do you mean?" "No, no." If you say yes, it's alive in the theaters and films." I said, "That's right, let's go." "No, when it came." "Why not?" And the answer to him because your kind of mind is made for other things for this world. I said, "No." I had a very bad year cuz I had jumped the truck of everything that was expected. How many have ever jumped the truck? Of everything, that was expected. And shocked your parents, I shocked my parents out of that one. In fact, I got telegram saying, God-- God is gonna punish you for this one. And it seemed that God there was something did, because I had jumped all the expectations and I had a terrible year. I went into graduate school, instead. Anyway, ah, now, it wasn't terrible in the graduate school, it's just that I had bad things happened. Anyway, in fact, that night, I, ah, was at Cape Sounion and I dove into the water just like Lord Byron had there. And when I dove through a six-foot man-of-war jellyfish, and fairly lost both my arms, but that's another story. But I jumped the truck and that's something else that we notice that when you jump the truck, it's like the guardian of the threshold and the hero's journey, isn't it? Where they say, "Okay, prove it. See, if you can stand up to it. Are you ready to take on? But I'm gonna call the intellikey. So, she is carried away, and in this wonderful tornado, remember? Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, uhm-hmm, hmm, and there's people roaring and there's a cow, and here comes Miss Gulch who turns into the witch, remember? Now, the point is, she lands in technicolor, it's black and white to that point in this effulgent, juicy, gorgeous world. It is about as far away from Kansas as possible. Why psychological this is happened? Because the first aspect of her becoming and entering the mythic life has to be that her sensory perceptions that have been so browned out, so detonated, have to be revived. I find in all my work friends that if you are going to enter into a larger life, or larger dispensation, or whatever you wanna call it, huh, you begin with the body if you can, and with the expansion of the sensory-based, why? Because the expanded sensory-based will give you access of within and without the more perspectives, more ways of knowing, more joy, more engagement in the whole process of life. Okay? Now, I'm gonna show you an exercise that is one of the best exercises I know for activating the sensory life, okay? You've got to get a partner. Everybody get a partner. This is fun stuff by the way, this is not like insolence so don't worry. 

00:38:40
[sil.] 

00:38:45
JEAN HOUSTON Does everybody have a partner? Is there someone who doesn't? Stand up, make yourself look fascinating. Stand up, there you are, you got a partner. Look around. It's so funny. I'm reminded talking about mythic sensibilities. I used to know a very interesting actress, very interesting human being by the name of Katharine Hepburn. And, she's so funny. She used to say, "Uhm, everybody thinks I'm Katharine Hepburn, I am not Katharine Hepburn. I'm good old the Yankee Kate. And I, I scrub my own blowers, I, I cook my own dinner, I take care of the garden and all my friends, that's who I am, good old Katie. Katharine Hepburn is this creature who lives on my shoulder, who I have to pretend is fascinating and thrilling but it's not me. She's-- I'm just sort of the victim of this being called Katharine Hepburn cuz I'm really just real old, good old Yankee Kate." Well, no, no. Oh, no, I can almost say anybody. Bu this is asked, by saying, "Fine, you're making yourself thrilling and fascinating." And she's worth a great character. Anyway, uhm, now, this is what we gonna do, it's one of the best ways I know that activates sensory forms. Are you ready? Okay. At the same time, I'm gonna have you in so-so yourself ensconce it around something that you would really like to do in the next three to four, to six months, something you'd really like to achieve. And please, don't say, "I wanna find the love of my life." You're sitting there with them right open. But what it is that you'd like to achieve, okay? We're gonna-- and put it in a sensory form. Now, we'll going to begin and I'm gonna pretend that I have a wonderful working partner of 28 years, Peggy Rubin. And I'm gonna pretend that Peggy is here and I'm gonna demonstrate each part. Peggy, I want you to see your sunrise, and she does. You have to close your eyes. Jean, I want you to see or imagine a, ah, a ship, a sailing ship, and, now, have you see? Peggy, I want you to walk along New York City with your head down and seeing all the different kinds of shoes going by. Jean, I'd like you to look into one of those windows and seeing somebody having a tremendous creative breakthrough and running to the computer and writing like that. Anyway, visual scenes, not the ones I gave you. Back and forth, begin. Challenge each other for visual scenes, visual. Okay. Coming to a natural ending. Shh. Peggy is back and I'm gonna talk to Peggy. Shh. Peggy, huh, I want you to touch the long beautiful soft bony nose of a horse. Jean, I like you to plunge your hands into a barrel of potato chips and break up as many as possible, feel that. Peggy, I'd like you to climb in oak tree.

JEAN HOUSTON Jean, I'd like you to shake hands with the 3-year-old child. Peggy, I'd like you to make snowballs with ungloved hands. Touch, back and forth. Shh. On your own, you can do this for very long times, I said, shh. Peggy, I'd like you to taste my special spaghetti Jeanutza, and that spaghetti with, ah, ah, al dente, of course, with olive oil, a little bit of butter and, ah, ah, oh, yes, lots of cra-- cra-- crashed garlic, fresh garlic, not cooked, lots of garlics, maybe 10 to 12 cloves. And it's freshly grated Parmesan and lots of, maybe, a whole cup full of my chop fresh, fresh basil, you know, and lots of hot black, ah, pep-- pep-- black pepper, taste it. Jean, I would like you to taste your own special cake, angel food cake topped with dark minted chocolate mousse and whip cream. Peggy, remember, when you were in South Texas as a child, I want you do bust open the ice cold watermelon and dive for it, and splash a lot of delicious cold icy watermelon in your mouth, do you remember, just put out the seeds. Back and forth, taste. Shh. If you don't want to stop, this is one I can tell, shh, shh, shh, shh. Smell. Peggy, I want you to smell a rose garden. Jean, I'd like you to smell your dog's fur when he comes in out of the rain, that's very nice when you-- Peggy, I'd like you to smell a diaper laundering service. 

00:44:50
[sil.] 

00:44:55
JEAN HOUSTON Jean, hmm, I would like you to smell a nice spotted sea and you're standing by and the crashing waves come in. Smell, back and forth. Okay? Shh, shh, shh. Sound. Peggy, I'd like you to hear Martin Luther King saying his great lines, I have A Dream. Jean, I'd like you to hear a chorus of my singing the Hallelujah choirs. Peggy, I want you to hear the wind in a pi-- pine forest. Jean, I want you to hear a diver on a tap board as, ah, his body goes like knife-like through the water. Peggy, I want you to hear a dear friends telling you that they love you. Hearing, back and forth. Everybody, now-- shh, stand up, put everything down. Stand up, put everything down. Close your eyes. Remember, I asked you to think about something that you really wanted to achieve and do? This is the art and science of manifestation. And what we're doing is we're going to create images, we're going to see, touch, hear, smell, taste, we're gonna live in it and we're going to act it out as the music plays. We're not in the rate relating with anybody else, you're just with yourself. When I have studied the phenomenology of high level creativity and manifestation, I have found out there's something very much like this is going on, different way. So, now, with your inner senses having been activated, I want you to use them. And when I start the music, you're going to not only see, hear, touch, taste the thing that you really intend in your life in the fairly near future and sure, it's what you want because these things tend to work. This is very important, I'm not done telling you, but really inactive. Use your whole body, that's very important, embody the idea, act it out. Nobody can see you, but me, and I'm a little near-sighted. So, it will be okay. All right? Get ready. Spread out if you have to. All right? And, sir, just start the music, please. 

00:47:55
[sil.] 

00:48:00
JEAN HOUSTON Begin to feel it. Act it out. Be in it, touch, taste, see, smell with, and act it, play it out. 

00:48:15
[music] 

00:48:35
JEAN HOUSTON Act it and smell it, touch it, taste it, be it. It is happening, your intention and then, act it out, use your whole at it. 

00:48:50
[music] 

00:49:40
JEAN HOUSTON Play it put, act it out, it's happening now. 

00:49:45
[music] 

00:52:10
JEAN HOUSTON Thank you. How are you feeling? How is it? Use music to carry intention. You listened to this and used all the imagery systems as many as you can. So, what we do, we did a, a very good technique in activating imagery which is back and forth, and Erickson would have approved. My husband, by the way, was a student of Erickson, uhm, and I met him beautifully. But you activate the imagery system, this is a tremendous thing to do with children, because you can also empower children to, to have new skills, to really be in a level of steam and possibility, even adolescence. But anyway, activate imagery. As you activate imagery, you are really shifting a lot of what is called the interior proprioceptors, the inner sensing system. And as it becomes very vivid, you find that you can then, work it around intentionality. So, that you essentially are having, uhm, energized, ah, intentionality and, ah, neuronal enthusiasts, hormonal energizers. And so, the inner imagery begins to work for you to keep you on track. So that when opportunities or things to really begin to activate the thing that you intend, then, you don't say, I will, maybe later. No, because those are neuronal energizers that really come from the activation of the interior proprioceptors, interior sensory systems begin to-- really begin to work for you. This is a very powerful exercise, if you do it. Okay? Now, she lands up in Munchkin land which is a high medieval civilization with gilds, "We represent the lovely." And they recognized her. And that's very important, the whole act and gift of recognition, recog-- and drag by cognitive therapy. How about recognitive-- recogni-- how many of you-- when you're working with your clients, your patients, you really have the gift of recognition of who and what they are. Deep recognition-- oh, can you cross the great divide of otherness and you see them as filled with much more than they had-- they may have forgotten. You are the rememberer. So that she is remembered. But, in the book, she is remembered as a goddess, you know. But who comes down? Well, of course, Glinda. Now, who is Glinda in this archetypal tale? Who is Glinda? Yeah, but she's also the archetype of the inteleki. She is the one that oversees, and those are the inteleki. It's a Greek word. It's the inteleki of an acorn to be an oak tree. It's the inteleki of a popcorn kernel to be a fully pop entity. It's the inteleki of a baby to be a grown up human. It's the deep purposiveness that is there, that is in each of us and maybe the inteleki of us to be God knows who are what? That it's part of our being. She needs a high guidance system, and in almost all mythic structures, a high guided system shows up as a particular ally whether you call it the s-- regular ally or super natural ally. You know, this is an older great stories. Now, this whole sense of inteleki, I mean, it's very hard to describe at metaphors, filter and fibre when we try to describe it. The inteleki think of it as yourself of being a thousand years to do your human homework. Think of it as the essence that is holding your becoming, a cosmic friend. It, it can be, ah, an agent of your quickening, your midwife of souls. It is that great means. And I'm going to do an inteleki exercise with you now. So, you can find your own particular Glinda, you will. Ah, bubble start appearing around, I'll get very nervous. So, put everything down. I'm gonna use music with this one, too. I'd like you to stand up and for the time, just accept that it is true that you're inteleki, your own deep higher self, if you will, essence self-guidance is gonna be standing opposite you and looking upon you with so much love. And if you don't believe it, it's okay, use everything and believe nothing. I don't care. I'm trying to give you some tools that can be enormously fruitful and helpful, okay? Okay. Would you put your hands up. So, eyes closed. And would you believe for the next several minutes that standing opposite you is your inteleki, your higher guidance, your essence, let's call it the great friend. The music start, please. 

00:57:50
[music] 

00:57:55
JEAN HOUSTON And I want you to know that what you begin to sense is magnificent friend who is standing opposite you, the inteleki, a great friend, who is looking upon you with so much love, with so much appreciation and you can feel yourself deeply loved, cherished, nurtured, understood. And yes, the inteleki knows your foil voice and your follies, but also knows as your depths, the brilliance, the fullness of who and what you are. And so, you receive this great seeing of yourself and your higher essence, your optimal being, looking upon you with so much love, and you feel yourself as so completely loved, so deeply seen, honored and cherished. You feel yourself being deeply nourished and nurtured by this great friend, the inteleki. You are affirmed, enhanced, deeply known and also evoked, called forth to the next stage of your emerging life, knowing that you are supported, sustained, loved, appreciated. Feeling yourself so seen, so deeply loved, nurtured and nourished by this great deeply, deeply loving great friend. Receiving, receiving now, that's inteleki. Receiving this other belief in yourself from the inteleki. This great companion of the part of your life, should you choose, should you choose? To receive this gift of the great companion, one who loves you, guides you, cherishes you, and other and complete loving. But the inteleki is, is more different. I want you to be in my place so, turn around, 180Â°. Everybody turn around, eyes closed, and know yourself now in the place of the inteleki, where the inteleki 's wisdom and lovingness, and deep knowledge of you and standing opposite you as the essence of yourself as you were there a few seconds ago. But now, empowering your local self from the sensibility of being the inteleki, sending so much love, so much nourishment, such deep acceptance and understanding of your local human standing opposite you, and feel and know that, and understand that being, who has gone through so much in this part of this incredible time loving that being from the perspective of being an inteleki. And then, stepping back and you're turning back around, turning back around, and then, your human form now receiving the inteleki fully, having known what it is to be inteleki, being yourself loved, cherished, empowered so, utterly, seen and known so deeply and richly companioned, and above all, loved, nurtured, cherished. Receive, receive, receive the gifts of being deeply seen, utterly accepted, empowered called forth into the fullness of who you are in this miraculous and magnificent, and strange and challenging time, called into the fullness of your gifts which are needed, you are needed in the fullness, you are. And the inteleki is there to affirm in from this moment forth. Should you choose to receive? Receive now this loving-- this cherishing, receive and knowing, receive, receive, receive. Now, this is your time, this is your crossing of the threshold into your larger life. But doing so, supported in soulless strength. The glory and the loving, and the affirmative at the deep sea of the inteleki. Receive this great, great friend who hire guidance. Now...

JEAN HOUSTON Thank you. Huh, and how are you? How are you? How are you? Huh, uhm-hmm, okay. I'm going on now with the rest of story, because, of course, the other always shows up, that which tries to get the ruby slippers which was silver in the book, but so, but it didn't show up well in the movie. You know, that's the reason for them. But the shoes that you are grounded in a miracle, you are grounded where the fact that your heart can beat once as 1,500 things have to happen for your heartbeat. But you are not in encapsulated bag of skin dragging around that really little ego. That you are an organism environment symbiotic with totality that you have enormous gifts that can take you into the higher home, but you don't know about them yet. So, naturally, you start on the road, probably, able to grow, probably, able to grow, probably, able, probably, probably, probably. The spiral, the road of spiritual pollen in many traditions, the road of spiritual pollen, where do you find that? Navajo tradition. The road to Elefsis, to Eleusis, and the other Athenian mysteries. The road in Chartres Cathedral, the great labyrinth-- by the way, I'll break a little-- who started the whole labyrinth movement? Me. That's right. That's right, I did. No, no, no, no, no, it became-- that was a symbol, the Chartres was came as the symbol of my work in 1962 and so I taught it all over the world. And then in my mystery school, one of my students was a canon lore Artres of great cathedral. She said, "Ah, this is my life work," and she started of putting it all the churches. Anyway, let's see-- but that great spiral of becoming, and then, of course, the road of spiritual pollen leads to what? It leads to the road of adventures. Now, if anybody has to go to the bathroom, it's okay, you get up, you go, you comeback, or you might wanna go to somebody else and see what they are doing. But, ah, I'm just letting you know that this your action, it's just that we're doing so much of that, ah, you know, and I have to do it in a short period of time. Now, the important part of this is that she is going to then meet the allies, and the allies only show up in the great mythic adventures. And the allies are not necessarily magical beings, they are often disempowered parts of yourself. Okay? So, of course, who's the first one she meets is the most likely one, who is the scarecrow. And she says, "Which way shall I go, what's the road part?" "That's a good direction, that's a good direction, too." Remember it? The fork in the road, the road not traveled. Would you perhaps-- if you had taken the other road, ended up in the same place that you are now? I don't know, but it's an interesting question. And, of course, it was played by the glorious Ray Bolger. How many of you saw Ray Bolger, you knew that? I once on Broadway under the New York City, well, it's a long one actually. And, ah, there he was-- it was the end of the shows, we're letting in Broadway 11 o'clock and there he was, I said, "Here you are in the great white way. And you still look the same. Great! I'm gonna dance." And he took me by the arm, we dance down in Broadway. And he was much better than I was. But anyway, uhm, the one who claims yearns, again, his yearning, "If I only had a brain, I would while away the hours conferring with the flowers, consulting with the rain. I would be another Lincoln." Remember all those wonderful lines? Now, the thing is, we all have enormous capacities for different kinds of intelligence. But, unfortunately, difference, we live in a society that does not utter all the other guys. So, if you're in an oral society and you're asked to write things, it's not gonna work the same way, unless you put orality and writing at the same. I have never met a stupid child, I met incredibly dumb system of education. Yeah. That reduce, that diminish to take away the magic of learning. And part of my work with the UN and other agencies around the world has tended to go in the countries like Bangladesh, and help them get rid of bad British missionary education of 100 years ago which is the Brits have longed since abandoned, and put art and music, and culture back into the curriculum. If a child is dancing, singing, drumming, dramatizing, incarnating, weaving information, they do not fail. You see? Some of you might never seen some of my schools, ah, the great myth school in Byron, New York, is one of them, you know. And, uhm, right now, I've-- how can I help Ecuador try to change some of the school systems. But, but, when we did that-- when we created new schools, actually, tens of thousands of them in Bangladesh, also empowering the women, because in Bangladesh, women were really fit right, it empowered women as teachers and it began to shift a lot of things. Now, how do we do this in our own lives? 

01:10:15
[sil.] 

01:10:20
JEAN HOUSTON Is, first of all, to know what is your major form of intelligence. In my book, my own autobiography of mythic life, I have whole chapters on how to do this. Also my book, Jump Time. But, how many of you think an images? How many of you think with words? How many of you are kinesthetic thinkers like Joe Campbell was? Any great smellers? Tasters? Any good tasters? Yes. I once had a conversation with the very great chef, what is suppose her name was? Julia Child, yes. She was taller than me. I met her in a hotdog contest in a mall street. She ate seven con-- seven hotdogs and five beers. "Oh, this is so wonderful, wonderful, joy. I have so much, so much thing to do." And I said to her, "Do you think and taste?" "All the time, my dear, all the time." So, I don't think, she really thought too, ah, a new ginger beer, and thought and taste to, you know. But, ah, they could literally wrap their mind, their mind and ideas would come through taste. Now, some of you are intuitive thinkers, how many of you are intuitive thinkers? Oh, it's all there. Heartfelt think-- thinkers? Emotional thi-- thinkers? Intellectuals Do we have any intellectuals here? Am I the only one? You often find I am. Now, you are an intellectual I can tell, okay. His smiling at me every time I make a kind of academic reference begin to grinning away. Anyway, the thing is also everybody is different and the brain rewires itself. Many of you know the Norman Doidge's book, yes? What's it call? The Brain That Changes Itself. Did you jam out of research? And if you do Lumosity-- you know, I love it, I enjoy it, too. Yeah. It doesn't do a thing for creativity, but it's-- it's a very good-- it's very good on focusing in speed. Anyway, the thing is, there are many, many ways-- oh, that something, it was such a good brain exercise. But let me just tell you how you do a brain exercise. You go-- and again, look at my books, my book-- which one-- ah, I never read my own books. Ah, uhm, my book, The Possible Human, has tremendous brain exercises in. And what you do is you focus on one hemisphere so that on one form, you see an A and on the othe-- other right, you see a one. And on the left you see a B and on the right you see a two. And you go through that and then, you put images in. So, for example, in my book, which-- I hope that you'll get because there's a lot of these things in it. In my book, I actually take you to a journey through your brain, through the stories in the movies and the images in the Wizard of Oz so that you can actually do this. So. I'll give you an example. Well, I wouldn't have the time to do it, not everything all day. Oh, well. 

01:13:50
[sil.] 

01:13:55
JEAN HOUSTON How many of you meditate? You know, that really is a good brain cleansing. Anyway, what you can do is go through the images of-- so, for example, say, here. On the right-- hmm? You thought I forgot all about you, I did not. I'm just looking at my book, a good frame. So, I was saying on the right side of the brain, you watch Toto enthusiastically sniffing an enormous water lily. You see? On the left side of the brain, you hear the munchkins begin to sing to celebrate your arrival. It's not kind of thing, and so, this is in the page 42, I think. On the right side of your brain, you suddenly hear the trumpets, horns, drums and brass band playing. On the left side of the brain, there's a dizzying rash, but can only be solved for in brainstorm. So, you see, what I do is I take you through that whole scene. But as you begin to imagine images, the whole senses of what you something like that on left and the right side. And you can do it, just make, make a CD or make, ah, MP3 of these exercises, and do that, and you'll begin to find that you will start having, uhm, much greater acuity and it will be also a sense of balancing out both hemispheres of the brain. We are the brain of this, you know, the mind of the universe, you know. So, this is-- this is something that can be extremely interesting, doing brain exercise. But the important thing is when, is to realize that you have enormous intelligence. Sometimes it has shifted to one level or another, sometimes you have to do the deep meditations. So, you, you just have brain cleansings, or deep breathings, but also what are you interested in. For example, I try to read poetry everyday, out loud, and I find that reading po-- po-- po-- poetry feels my mind and my soul with metaphors, and metaphors are what turns me on, poetic metaphors. And I'm, uhm,-- one of the reasons I live in Ashland, Oregon, is it's the center of the Shakespeare festival and I'm a Shakespeare buff. And so what I do-- shall I show you what turns me on? It's really interesting. Okay. For me, it is the recitation of Shakespeare in the original sound. You want me to do a little to show you? This is what 16th century Shakespeare sounded like. Okay. Supposed you're a modern method actor and you're playing Hamlet. You might say, "Now, I'm alone. Ho-woo, uhm-hm, what a rogue and peasant slave am I. Is it not monstrous that this, ah, player here, but in a fiction, in a dream of passion, could force his soul so to his own conceit." Okay? But if you were Richard Burbage, on the globe theater stage in 1600, you would have sounded very differently and this is what we think it sounded like. Are you ready? 

01:17:50
[sil.] 

01:17:55
JEAN HOUSTON "Now I am alone. Ah, what a rogue and peasant slave am I. Is it not monstrous that this player here but in a fiction, in a dream of passion could force his soul so to his own conceit that from her working all his visage wanned, tears in his eyes, distraction in as aspect, a broken voice, and his whole function suiting with forms to his own conceit? And all for nothing! For Hecuba! Hah, what's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, that he should weep for her? What would he do, had he the motive and the cue for passion that I have? He would drown the stage with tears and cleave the general ear with horrid speech, make mad the guilty and appal the free. Yet I, a dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak, like John-a-dreams unpregnant of my cause, and can say nothing. No, not for a king, upon whose property and most dear life a damned defeat was made. Am I a coward? For it cannot be that I am pigeon-levered and lack gall to make oppression bitter, or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites with this slave's offal, bloody, bawdy villain! Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain! Oh, vengeance! Oh, what an ass am I? This is most brave that, I, the son of a dear father murdered, prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell must like a whore, unpack my words and fall a-cursing to the sky like a very drab, a scullion, fie on it! Foh! I have heard that guilty creatures sitting at a play have by the very cunning of the scene been struck so to the soul that soon they have proclaimed their malefactions. For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ. I'll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle, I'll observe his look, I'll tent him to the quick, if he but blench, I know my course. The spirit that I have seen may have been the devil and the devil hath power to assume a pleasing shape, yeah, and out of my weakness and my melancholy as he is very potent with such spirits. Abuses me to damn me, oh, I'll have grounds more relative than this. The play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king." And that's 1600 speech. But, look, different languages have different sounds, Elizabethan language which was the British language we've ever have, and the English language, has sounds that strum the brain. Cuz what is in the head, is it? What's in the head? It's a sonic chamber and I've also made studies of renaissance language in French and German, Italian. And you really find that these languages that they spoke as far as we can recover cuz we don't exactly know-- but, uhm, this was very close, they activate the word. The old languages, I'm a student of all languages, that Greek-Egyptian. They had different sounds, I mean, ancient Greek, which is my favorite, I did things to the mind and body that store a kind of tremendous effulgence of creativity, the opening lines of the Odyssey, which translate the Sing in me, Muse, and through they tell the story of the man of many ways, the story of Odysseus. Oh, what it did sound like? Andra moi ennepe, Mousa, polutropon. It's ancient Egypt. Andra, of the man, moi, to me, Mousa, andra moi ennepe, Mousa. Ennepe, say, polutropos, how many, in many ways. So, it's important if you can read poetry out loud and whatever is your language. So, that your mind becomes thick with metaphor and you can feel blood in your mouth from the fullness of the speaking, this will do so much, it doesn't have to be little blood, but you know what I'm saying. This will be so much that it actually sonically stimulates the mind brain system. Can you follow? Well, I promise you miracles. If you would do this, uhm, sounds with danda-danda-danda-nuro-yeon-in-danda-nira-danda, the way we get it. But, uhm, we think, it's probably not at all different, danda-danda-danda-danda-hmm. Okay, enough of that. Uhm-hmm. So, oh, you've got this bright character who's going to do wonders, he's gonna think-- help everybody to think their way through because he's been empowered, because she's got her intellikey and she's bringing disempowerment to them, and of course, who do they meet next, the disempowered heart-- Oh, my--no. Now, a lot of hearts are disempowered because we are disconnected, many of us from family, from tribe, from friends. Uhm, I was just with the Hagabo(ph) indigenous people who live on the Amazon, and they're not disempowered, I mean, they're mad at the oil companies, this is what they should be. But it's as if there is that, that, hmm, that circle of lovingness, lovingness and support. That is very nourishing. A lot of us go through life with unnourished hearts. How many patients or clients do you have who come to you with unnourished hearts? And yet, we live in a time in which radical nourishment is required, isn't it? And not just nourishment for herself and for others but also for the whole worlds, I like to do a little process with you. This is from my book about nourishing yourself, your own heart and the world. Okay. Just stretch a little so that you're ready and open. This is a lovely exercise. 

01:25:50

01:26:00
JEAN HOUSTON Here's your heart need. 

01:26:05
[sil.] 

01:27:35
JEAN HOUSTON Close your eyes. Following your breath all the way in and all the way out. All the way in and all the way out, just do that for few moments. 

01:27:50
[sil.] 

01:28:30
JEAN HOUSTON And what I want you to do is breath deeply through your nose, out through your mouth, relaxing your body more and more. 

01:28:45
[sil.] 

01:28:55
JEAN HOUSTON And imagine that you're traveling along a sound like path through a beautiful forest, and use all your senses. See the light as actually streaming through the trees, hear the sound or fig leaf as they step on the Earth, hear the birds overhead. 

01:29:25
[sil.] 

01:29:30
JEAN HOUSTON Huh, feel the rhythmic beat of your heart, there in the space in you, and thank your heart for all the beautiful work that it does. Sit down in a beautiful place in this forest and breath in and out, and imagine your heart gently expanding, just a little bit. Our hearts hold memories and images, big and small. You're in a lovely place, what is around you? Is it warm or cool? Are there trees there? Water? In your mind, look around you, use all your senses and imagine the place and all of its expansive grandeur. Now, shift in your focus to one specific detail in the scene. It could be a golden honeybee or a blossom, or tiny curve shell on the beach. Feel your heart with other images from nature that you've particularly loved. Thanks these things for blessing you. Think now of any animals or live creatures that you love or may have loved, the equivalence of Toto for you. Picture them happy and healthy, and ramping or galloping, pouring. You might include wild beings that you feel drawn to, wolves, ravens, dolphins, or elephants. Imagine their warm fur, their feathers lit by sunshine, the tails splashing the surface of the sea as they dive. Use all of your senses. What do they sound like? Smell like? Feel like? Feel your heart with images of these beloved creatures and thank them for blessing you. Now, would you imagine a yellow brick road that runs from a wonderful place in the distance straight through your heart, and all of your favorite people are there, followed by your ancestors. Walking, skipping, dancing, running, along this road. And gently and easily, expand your heart to embrace this parade of friends and family, expand it enough to embrace the miraculous entirety of each one's life on this Earth, all of the painless and all of the loveliness. Now, expand your heart to include all human beings. Those are the past, the present, the future. Fishermen, fisher ladies in France, weavers in Guatemala, doctors in Zimbabwe, scientists in Japan, ship shearers in New Zealand, wild artists in New York, see your painting, people of all ages everywhere. And bless and thank each person as he or she passes through your heart. Imagine this blessing and gratitude, lifting them up. Lifting them up, filling their-- filling and filling their hearts, everything is interconnected through. Now, imagine your heart expanding to encompass the entire Earth, pour your loving energy into the oceans, the mountains, the forests, the cities, the villages, the desserts. Think of all the wonderful things that Earth provides for, for you and for the creatures who live upon her, air, water, children, food, beauty. And bless and thank the Earth for all of her love, abundance and life sustaining generosity. Now, move your heart's awareness out into space to encompass the sun that gives warmth and light, to the moon and all of the planets. Move out through the solar system into the expanding universe now blessed and enhanced by your conscious thoughts and blessings. Imagine all of the beings on the other side of the veil who may care so much about our welfare, the vast of our population, invisible helpers who assist us the moment we asked, send them gratitude through your heart. Now, expand your own awareness to touch upon the very source of all existence. The life force that keeps it all going. Breath that in, pour love and gratitude out as you exhale, breath it in the source of all love, breath it out in gratitude. But Dante calls, "L'amor che move il sole e l'altre stelle," the love that moves the sun and all the stars. And I actually feel a kind of beating of your heart with the heart of all creation, the source heart, a heart of the universe. The two of you beating together in a symphony of unity and love.

JEAN HOUSTON Now, slowly and easily, put your consciousness back from the source, back from the solar system, back from the Earth, back from all beings, human and otherwise, in both sides of the veil, back from your favorite places in the natural world, and finally, back into your own radiant heart. And feel the beating of your physical heart in the center of your chest. And though, that these things you have cherished are always with you, but once your heart has been filled, you now ha-- have more available to give to others, and the gift we can give of ourselves is the gift of radical empathy. As therapists, as evocateurs of the Possibilian people, affirming the deeper essence of people we meet, strengthening our ability to see some good in everyone, the potential, the greater core of each, we can choose to love others with the gift of truly, truly seeing them, listening to them being fully present with our intention. And when we take the time to do this, the otherness disappears and reestablish resonance in our relationships. The heart, the human heart can go to the lights of God. 

01:38:10

01:38:15
JEAN HOUSTON Huh, how are you? How are you? With the heart necessarily comes courage, because often courage, corner and corner of the heart, the great ambivalence that we have courage, isn't it? Can we take that risk? Can we do those things? The cowardly lion. There he is all tramped out, looking leonine is actually a great fool and a great clown. Look, he's so scared, he is a bully. How many of you know really scared people who are bullies? So, this whole issue of courage is such a big one. So, much of my life is that of being a social artist, a social artist, someone who believes in human development in the light of social change. Some of you may or may not know that I have worked in interesting places like the White House where I lived for year and the half, Hillary Clinton, one week out of every month helping her write a book called, "It Takes a Village to Raise a Child." Trying to help him in various ways. I was very successful with her. But anyway, uhm,-- and you see people, I mean, people trashed people in the White House and it is-- they have awful lives, really. And once I asked Hillary, I said, "Hillary, how can you stand your life when you trash it every moment and every day? It's not every day, it's like every hours. Somebody comes in with the package and says horrible things to you, how can you stand it? How can you have the courage to just hang in there?" And she said, "Well, Jean, it's gratitude, I just always see, keep in the front of my life, all the people and things, that I am so grateful for. And I just go through that over and over, and over again." And I would have to say that whole sense of gratitude was the source of her courage which is enormous, I mean, regardless of what awful-- political things you say about her. My God, well-- there was a, uhm, comical friend of mine said, "Politics, poly, poly which means many, tics, tics." You know he used to. But what in you-- and one of the things about courage is you have to discover what is it in you that really keeps you going. Now, one of it is a passion for the possible. 

01:41:15
[sil.] 

01:41:15
JEAN HOUSTON Knowing that what you do profoundly makes a difference one way or the other, how many of you know that? And especially now, each one of you in your life will probably influence 5 to 10 million people, given your profession. So, this is where you really watch your thoughts, what are you letting in, what are you not letting in. Real courage is the ability to look fiercely at oneself and say, "Look what I'm doing, look what I could be doing, let's do it." It's also to use your imagination so powerfully of something that you intend to do that is for the betterment of others, so powerfully that it takes on a life by itself, it moves from just mirror imagination to the imaginal. It becomes part of the construct, the support system of making a better world. That's a hard thing to say, but it's something that truly works, my friends. And then you see the image, you get sponsored by an image and you have the passion to go ahead and do what you have to do even though, it may seem existentially very risky. Essentially, it may be necessary. The essence may requite this great ax of you, your existence may say, "That's the old bring, watch it, watch out, just like crossing the street against the light, you know, you know." Huh, Hegel, once wrote about world historical individuals, people who's particular passion corresponded with the passion and the turnings of the time. And out in front of behind the scenes, they became the entrepreneurs of progress, they became the ones profoundly made a difference. If you can see yourself as you are now in this world in time as a world where he called a world historical individual who's passion corresponds to the passion beneath the turnings of the time, then, you will almost have a kind of legacy from the future that begins to work with you. You follow what I'm saying? So, legacy from the past and a legacy from the future, and it is a blind shift is a paradigm shift, but it can you paradigm, you know, it, it really is. Let me give you an exercise, please, and just let me just check my-- this is a lovely exercise and it is one that can be powerfully empowering of your-- of your-- of your courage forms. So, it will be, ah, cho-cho-cho, hmm, uhm-hmm, uhm-hmm, uhm-hmm, uhm-hmm, uhm, on, on, uhm, the C-- CD two, number four and five, and if we don't get-- we get to the end of it, it's number four and number five one moves and other just go back to four, okay? I'm going to show you a powerful exercise to receive and maintain courage, how is that? Okay. Put everything and stand up, and step out in all manner of places. Not yet, don't start it yet, but pretty soon. Okay. Would you rub your hands together? You feel it, you feel it, you feel the vitality, feel the vitality between them, yes. I want you to look at your right hand and I want you to accept that right hand as the world of the fathers. That means, not just your own father, grandfather, great-great grandfather, great-great-great-great grandfather, all the way back, world of the fathers. Now, look at your left hand, and that is the world, if you're the mothers, the mothers, the grandfathers, the great-great-grandfathers, looking all the way back. When the music begins, this what you're going to do, watch me. And I'll-- I'll guide you on this. You are going to start here, gradually go backwards, and I'll talk with it. And you're gonna touch the lives of your ancestors. The world of the mothers on the left, the world of the fathers on the right, until finally, going a way, way back. Prow of the ship of ancestors with beings who are tens of thousands of years behind you, but who are your ancestry, all right? And we'll do it very slowly, okay? Putting your hands up like this one, touching, touching the lives, the world of the fathers on the right, the world of the mothers on the left. 

01:46:20
[music] 

01:46:25
JEAN HOUSTON Would you begin the music, please? And begin to touch the world of the fathers on the right, the world of the mothers on the left, of your own fathers and mothers. And begin to now move apart as you go back in time, touching the lives of your grandparents, the grandmothers on the right, the grandfathers on the left. And begin to go back further, further, and you're now in the 19th century. And then, further back, the world of the fathers on the right, the world of the mothers. Fill in those lines as you go back into the 18th century. The 17th century people who may have struggle to come here, came in storage, others who stayed but some of you on the-- on the right, a wise old rabbi in Russia-Poland, on the left, the woman in the south of France stops her weaving, she's in the 14th century and she wonders, "Who is it? Is it St. Martin? Is it St. Catherine?" But, no, it is you, continuing to go back further and further. And on the right in the 10th century, a fisherman in a little round coracle boat on the bay of Galway, he's wondering, "What is it? Is it the Merlin? Is it the Leir? Or, is it that new feller Jesus? Who is it? But, it is you. And on the left, in China, the woman is making congee, that rice porridge for her large family, in the shore of the China Sea, and on the right, there is a man who is walking with poor girl, and asking her questions, but she refuses to answer with just smiles. Going back further and further, 1500 BC, further back in Egypt, on the left, a woman priestess of the goddess seek him at, the goddess of healing and magic is intoning the sacred words to bring the powers into her body and mind. And on the right in Egypt, around 2800 BC, a man is pulling the stones to build a pyramid, your great-great-great-great-great-great grandfather. And on the left, 8000 BC, a woman is poking holes with the stick, we shall put the wild grass seeds in, in eastern Turkey. And on the right, 20,000 years ago, lying on his back in the cave in Spain, a man is painting the great mastodon that he saw that filled in with so terror and wonder in the cave. Going back further back feeling the lives of this ancestors, feeling them, rising up to be touched, to be sinned, to be honored by you. Going back and back 50,000, 100,000 years, all those grandmothers, all those grandfathers, feeling the honoring and they are honoring you for you are touching their lives as we go further and further, and further back, until you are the place where not quite human, not quite animal, but they're yearning for something that is pulling them forward, and you, the prow of the ship of ancestors. Chest out, holding the legacy of all of those lives, all of the efforts, the energy that is flowing into you now, flowing into you now, feeling you with the courage and a passion for the possible, that legacy of ancestors. But now, very, very slowly beginning to bring in your arms forward, but this time, touching upon and honoring these lines-- oh, yes, touching the life of that woman in childbirth 15,000 years ago somewhere in the Baltic sea, touching and giving grace to that shaman in Africa, who is calling up the spirits of possibility and of understanding somewhere in Central Africa, touching and honoring as your hands come forward, honoring these lives, blessing them, thanking them, giving them the sense of your deep, deep, deep gratitude. Honoring all these lives coming forward, forward, honoring and these lives, you can feel them they are tactual, they are a thousand years ago. With the woman who is the healer in your village on the left, 1,000 years ago, the man who is the forester on the right and they, they feel your life, they feel honored and they feel blessed as you honored them, as you come forward to 500 years ago, for hundred honoring, accepting and being filled with the spirit and the energy, and the courage and the lost and the gathering founders of so many, many, many ancestors and they're all there as part of your being, as you come forward into the grandfathers, the fathers, the mothers, until your hands are crossed across your breast, and you have gathered in the totality of your ancestry and feeling the totality, feeling it, feeling it deepening you, giving you the courage and the passion for the possible, knowing that you had maintained the strength, their honor, their beingness there, their great affirmation and gratitude to you for recognizing. But yet, there is more and with your right hand, put your right hand and arm behind you, so that you can keep the continuity. And put your left hand in front of you, for in the future, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 years in the future, there is the descendant of your mind or your body, or both, but one who has learned of what you did today and is reaching out to you to be connected and is thanking you for all that you did in your life there in the 20th and the 21st century to assure their own-- and you, a great term between you are one who holds time past, time future, gathered in time, present. You are the one, the equation in between the courage floods into you from the future, the affirmation. It affirms and flows into you from the past, you are the term between and you can feel a growingness, a potency, a magnificent, great sea of courage, that is yours to inherit from the past, to receive from the future for it is yours now and ever shall be life without end.

01:56:10
JEAN HOUSTON Thank you. How are you? Okay. The story goes on-- well, of course. But now, you have all the elements of mind and heart, and courage and, ah, the intrepid little Dorothy and the great little dog, and so it is a kind of perfection. And they finally get to the Emerald City before, however, they get to the Emerald City they fall asleep because the bad which has made them fall asleep, the lo-- the flesh and blood ones. But the tin man and the scarecrow try to wake them up. This is a great metaphor, my friends, uhm, when we're nearly there-- how many of you have noticed this? Nearly there, we fall asleep, we would say, "Yeah, maybe later. I'm gonna go over here first, I'm gonna go-- yeah, I'm go." Take this other out for a while, entropy, galloping entropy, entropy, the rising up of the, the down writing of energy. Entropy always comes in, it is always there as a challenge. How many of you have noticed that? Entropy, when you are nearly there, uhm-hmm, and that's when you really need somebody to really be there for you. There's a-- there's a practice in northern India when somebody is in an entropic state or despair, or going into depression, he or she says to a dear friend, "Will you be God for me for three months?" "Yes, I'll be God for you for three months, I'll tell you what to do, I will hold your excellence." Sometimes it is very good to have a teaching learning community that holds your excellence and gives you moral lesson through the path. Not that you shouldn't have this wondering things, but I'm just saying there are-- this happens so much. "Odysseus, Odysseus comes back. Hero of Troy, Troy. 10 years, he said, "Within sight of Ithaca." And he says, "Hey guys, you hold the sail, and the sail holds the contrary wins. I'm going downstairs to catch 40 wings all pretty for Penelope." You know, wrong. And the crew says, "What is he supposes in the sail? What's in there? What's in there? Let's find out." Shh- grrrrhh-grrrrhh, all the winds back out to sea for another 10 years. Have anybody ever done that? Missed your Kairos, missed your loaded moment, uhm-hmm? Nobody? Well, I'm sure, have, cuz entropy comes and that's when you need your archetype, your inteleki, your Glinda, your friends, whatever it is to put you back on track as you brings snow to wake them up. And then, of course, what happens? They get to the Emerald City, nobody is gonna see their involvement, they're welcomed. We have a di-- force of a different color, you've got laughing people. Now, this is very important, ha, ha, ha, ho, ho, ho. 

01:59:35
UNKNOWN Ha, ha, ha... 

01:59:35
JEAN HOUSTON That's how we laugh the day away in the merry old land of Oz. Ha, ha, ha, ho, ho, he, he-- remember that? Jokes. Humor. Laughter is not simply 15 uncoordinated muscles with altered breathing. Huh, you know, it's the daughter of humorous, it's something else. Here, ah, I'll demonstrate. Just call out-- I kno-- I know jokes from every country in the world. When I-- when I die, they're gonna open my head and all that's gonna come out is thousands of jokes. All right? Well, just, just call of any country and I'll see what-- so, call it out, come on. It's a matter of-- Australia. She said Australia. Oh, Australia, where are you? Have you familiar with Australia? No. But, she has for Australia. All right. Australia. Okay. All right. Here's a joke taught to me by a-- ah, told me by an, ah, Australian aborigine, camp driver, are you ready? So, ET, you know, ET, extra terrestrial, is flying over Australia. And he listens to the ads for Foster's beer, Foster's beer, you know, Australian beer. ET says, "Well, I'll, I'll try it." And so, he goes down, makes himself look sort of human. He goes down to, ah, Alice Springs, central of Australia, ought to stay of the year. And, ah, at the bar, there's nobody there, except at the very end is a lorry man, you know lorry man is? A trucker. Okay. 300 pounds, you know. Nursing his Foster's, you know, in the tea bar, so he goes to him and he says, "I'll have a Foster's, please?" Uhm-uhm-uhm-uhm-uhm, jumps on top of the bar, runs easily at the bar, puts his face in the lorry man's beer and goes, "Brrrrrrr, I'll have another Foster's, please?" Uhm-uhm-uhm, jumps on top of the bar, runs easily at the bar, puts his face in the lorry man's beer and goes, "Brrrrrrrr." "What is goes on?" He said, "Night times, lorry man, nice bloke." Slow to anger, finally says, "I might keep that off, I'll pull out your arm." "That's okay," says ET, "I'll grow another one." "Well, you know, I'll pull out your leg." "That's okay too," says ET, "I'll grow a new one." "Well, you know, I'll pull out your wiener. Ei, you've got none. Oh, you've got no wiener up?" "No." "Well, wha-- what do you do when you wanna piddle?" "Brrrrrrrrrrr." 

02:02:25

02:02:30
JEAN HOUSTON Is anybody Jewish in the audience? Oh, yeah, psychotherapist, I should find some Jews. How many-- who's-- who's Jewish? Okay. You know what sitting shiva is? You know, or do you know of Jewish, the, the smoke salmon, smoke whitefish? Okay. So, Mrs. Goldberg is very orthodox and her son, her son, Marvin, is a young doctor, and, ah, he goes to the Tucson Hospital to do his internship, falls madly in love with his nurse, who's a beautiful Navajo girl, and they married. His mother, who is super orthodox is so angry, she says, "Oh, not only you marry a chicer, you marry an Indian chicer. You're dead to me, I don't wanna hear from you. Now, go." But it's a tremendous-- you know, between souls, tremendous marriage, look very happy. Two years later, they have twins. And Marvin says, "Darling, do you think I'll call my mother?" "And, see if you can make peace, it's just well." "I don't know, darling, I'll try." "Oh, hello, Mrs. Goldberg, this your..." "I know who you are. You are-- you're dead to me, I don't wanna-- I don't know-- you have to stop, you see?" "We have just had twins, you've just become a grandmother." "I am?" "Yes. And grandmother Goldberg is better than that. Not only are they twins, but in your honor, we have given them Jewish names." "Really, my darling? What are they?" "Smoke whitefish and sitting Shiva." All right. Oh, well, all right. Oh, thank you. Give me another country, come on, come on. 

02:04:25
UNKNOWN Ireland. 

02:04:30
JEAN HOUSTON Ireland, Ireland, somebody said Ireland, Ireland, Ireland, Ireland, Ireland, I just met-- uhm, bishop O'Rourke, you know, the high bishop of Dublin, realizes on the eve of Easter Sunday that his, his great orator, you know, Father McGregor, has the-- has the laryngitis. "What we gonna do, what am I gonna do? I have no orator tomorrow, what am I gonna do to plow the whole bishop, the whole charity, the basic cathedral will be packed, what will I do?" "Ah, well, there's Father Finny in, in this lake." "I finally know who is greatest great, but he hates the Brits and he ends every sermon intercession, the Brits, I can't be having done that. Well, we're lost, but I'll-- I'll try it. Hello, Father Finny, this is your bishop." "Whoa, how are you Bishop?" "How about you?" "Well, I'm fine. But, you know, ah, Father McGregor, our great orator, he has the laryngitis, and we know you're very good. We wonder if you'd like to be coming and giving the Easter sermon." "Oh, I'd be honored." "If that is, is-- but, one other thing, it cannot be trashing the Brits at the end. Well, you have a lot of Brits people and people from all over, you have to promise me, you won't be trashing them?" "Ye-- ye-- yes, all right. I'll right. All right." So, comes Easter Sunday, the place is packed with Brits and French people from all over, and indeed, he gives a great sermon, and you can feel it-- you could feel the wind of the palm, since the people, you know, the, the, the-- it was a palm celebration, Jesus, and, you know, he can even hear the little clip crump of the donkey that he's riding on. And he finally gets to the last supper, and what they eat, you know, corned beef and cabbage. You know, I'm little bit of Genghis and he thinks plains here. And finally, he gets to the place where he says, "And Jesus said, 'One of you is gonna be betraying me. Will it be you Matthew?' 'Oh, no, Lord, what makes you think I'll do it? No, I love you Lord.' 'Will it be you, John?' 'Oh, Lord, never, never, never, never, I love you so much.' 'Peter, will it be you?' 'Never me, oh, no, Lord, love you.' And finally he goes to Ju-- Judas, he says, 'And it will be you who will be betraying me, Judas?' And Judas says, 'I don't know, governor, what makes you think I'll do it to you like that?'" Anyway-- no, no, I've got to stop. If I start with jokes, I can go on a very, very, very long time. Do any of you ever make up, uhm, limericks? Your mind gets inspired by limericks. I love limericks. I mean, people say-- and I-- you give me three words, I can give you a limerick. And, ah, remember, when somebody from the Oregon said, "Okay. Here's three words, Duluth, Minnesota, gender and drunk." I came up with, a mean little man from Duluth was unclean and unkind, and uncouth. He went on a bender, and while drunk, changed his gender. And now, is our beloved doctor Ruth. Anyway, do, do limericks, limericks really increase ones creativity, da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da, okay? Huh, all right. But humor is very important, humor shakes up the world, doesn't it? And it gives you another reality, an alternate reality, a whole different way of seeing and doing things. Anybody got a great, great, great joke, not a dirty one? Nobody has a joke that's not a dirty one? You got a good joke, not a dirty one, come on. Okay. 

02:08:25
UNKNOWN I forget it. I'm sorry. Thanks. This is a joke that I made up to be able to be told for children. So, be prepared and I'll be very honored if any of you decided to share it with the children. What do you call it if your house is haunted by invisible chickens? Poltergeists. 

02:08:50
JEAN HOUSTON Very good. Anybody else got a non dirty joke? Okay. Come on. 

02:08:55
[sil.] 

02:09:00
UNKNOWN This is from the great line, which is an AA meeting in Branton Capital joke section in the back. So, you know how of a pessimist sees the glass as half-empty, and the optimist sees the glass as half-full, well, the alcoholic says, "You gonna drink that?" 

02:09:25
JEAN HOUSTON Now, we're getting to the psychiatric jokes, oh, God. I once nearly got thrown-- this is my young and stupid days, I once nearly got thrown out of a meeting of psychiatrist, I couldn't help myself. We were talking very seriously about Freudian psychiatry, Freudian analysis. And I don't know the devil made me do it, I said, "Oh, yes, the exploration of the id body odd," and that's just-- and so many people were mad at me. Anyway, anyway, tell jokes, go read joke books. They are wonderful, I mean, it's, ah, yeah, it's something that-- see, it shakes up reality, you take unlikely things. When you put them together, and what do you have? You have a whole new reality, hmm? Yeah, a lot of people have laughed and have practically, throw me out, I mean, you know, this was a long time ago. Nowadays, even Freudian analysis isn't taught anymore, what do they teach? They don't teach psychoanalysis anymore in schools, or do it. It's all pills cognitive therapy. Pills, pills taught by pills. I didn't say it, I'm sorry. I will leave now, if you insist. I didn't say it, got a risk to that one. All right, do you want to know the one that had, uhm,-- let me see if I can remember it. Hillary laughed-- I used to tell Hillary a lot of jokes, she laughed so hard, she fell over on her back. I mean, that was-- it shouldn't get hurt, she fell over cuz she's laughing so hard. So, three guys die and they go after St. Peter, and St. Peter is being toughed with the gate. And, ah, one doctor says-- and he says, "Well, what are you? What did you do in your life?" He said, "Well, I was a doctor." "Oh, doctor, why do you think you belong here?" "Well, it's true, I, ah, I was a surgeon but I gave it up to give free medical therapy." "Well, that's nice, you can go in." Next man comes along. "And you?" "Ah, I was a lawyer." "Oh, lawyer, what make you out of here?" "Well, no, no, no, please, it's true. I, I was a trial lawyer, but I gave it up to give free law, ah, help the people." "All right, all right." The next guy, frankly, pushes and say, "Oh, come on, Peter, of course, I belong here. In my life, I ran a string of HMOs." And peter says, "Well, okay, you can go in, but you can only stay three days." No, no, let's stop. Oh, I can't get in. You know, how many of you get into that obsessive type of thing where you can't stop, you know, that's-- that's like limericks and jokes, okay. So, that the point is that what you see in the Emerald City is a model of a possible society. They laughed, they have the cleanup and brush-up society, they, ah, have a kind of joyousness, a green. In the book, they were green glasses. So, to seeing in then, of course, in, ah, in, ah, the movie, it is the Emerald City. Ah, in fact, Frank Baum, when he wrote this book, was officially called it, the Emerald City, but they figured it wouldn't work, and so, it became the Wizard of the Wizard. And then he saw on, ah, in his office Oddy and sey(ph), Odyssey, and so he made us feel our skin. His great granddaughter wrote to me which he knew, I was writing this book. And she said, "I thought you like to know that my great grandpa, Frank Baum, wrote in the family diaries." That he received it all at once. It was a complete download. And he just pick up his pencil, he didn't stop writing. He said, he wrote itself same as-- who else? Download? J.K Rowling, Harry Potter, yeah, all there, and there of all the episodes, it was certainly the basis was there. Sometimes the creative unconscious becomes, ah, huh, a self-- it, it activates self-creating works of art, what are called technically, the automatisms of the creative process. Have any of you ever had that, the self-creating works of art? Suddenly, it's all there. Well, any of you have ever had that? I keep wishing for that, but it never happens to me. Four or five planets in Taurus, these kinds of mass things don't have-- let me, but what happened to you? 

02:14:15
UNKNOWN What's amazing is that, ah, Dorothy is involved, I-- ah, my father was a psychoanalyst and when I finally realize that I wasn't going to ever do psychoanalysis, I gave away his library, which I have been storing to the, ah, Kansas Psychoanalytic Institute. And I drove on surface streets and I passed through Roswell, and I passed through liberal, and went to Dorothy's house, and after there, I was on my way to Wichita, and then, it happened. The whole story came to me in a flash, I mean, pulling off the road, grabbing papers, scribbling madly so, it wouldn't be gone. And I wrote the screenplay about Dorothy and Roswell. Dorothy being, ah, an elderly woman now in 1947 in the 4th of July weekend, and she has another Ozian episode, and it's-- and it came exactly like that, a sudden blast and it was there. Never happened to me before, and it's the only screenplay I've ever written, thus ever gotten any, uhm, positive notice from screenplay for us in school. I'd love to send you a copy. 

02:15:25
JEAN HOUSTON You love what? 

02:15:25

JEAN HOUSTON Please do, yeah. All right. My friends, now, what happens is, of course, the impossible tasks. How many of you have ever been given impossible tasks? But they are in a team, they're not by themselves, it's very important. The teaching learning community, they're on-going community that works together. And as a team, they brave incredible things, the, the road disappears, it's the pathless path. Nobody has ever done this before. Go, get the witch's broom. Remember? And so, they-- he-- the, the scarecrow has to think out new ways to get there into the castle, the other one feels the way through it and, of course, the one who leaps the chasms and gets them across to, to this place because there's no road, is the cowardly lion, the lion. And when they finally get there, they are, of course, surrounded by the soldiers, "Oh, we owe, we owe her." Remember that? I always sound sort-- it sounded like, "Oh, we owe, we owe, owe her." But I'm not sure that's true. And they get there into their costumes and-- well, anyway, what happens is that Dorothy and the little doggie get captured, and of course, the witch is so happy. "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, I'm gonna now-- give me those slippers, or I'll kill your little dog." But, of course, the slippers will not come off. So there, she think, she's gonna have to kill Dorothy and she turns, of course, time running out. This is very important cuz a lot of you may actually be thinking that in your life the time is running out. Boloney, I'm 76 years old, I don't even know what I'm gonna be when I grow up, so. It's not like that. But time, this time running out, I think is a very, very, very-- if I'm limping, I'm sorry, I fell down a lava crater in the GalÃ¡pagos. Do you know why I fell down a lava crater in the GalÃ¡pagos? I took a trip in June, a friend of mine, "Where do you wanna go?" I said, "Somewhere I haven't gone." Cuz I've been sort of everywhere, the GalÃ¡pagos. We have-- we were nice little cruise ship, and it was in two parts. The thing-- One group came on the first and left, and second, and left. And I wanted to be left alone, I wanted to be, you know, just to be able to be nobody would be there cuz I do get, uhm, recognized lot. So, the first group came on, nobody recognized except one man, smiled and winked, and that was it. Second time is a whole bunch of people, youngers people-- young families, lost of children. And someone, he actually said to me, "What do you do?" And without thinking, the devil make me do it, I said, "I teach their great thinking, never keep everybody away." No. "Sally, she teaches their great, bring your-- bring little Dickey, I know he's ADD, she could help. Oh, and then, here's Joe, and here is me." Suddenly, I never seen those Navajo dolls with all the children, well, that was me for that time. Well, they all decided that I was a whole lot of fun, the kids. So the 69-year-old said, "Come on, Jeanie, let's go, let's go run over the lava craters." I said, "Okay." Now, their feet were this big and I wear size 12. An when I turned the corner of my shoes, go for a while and then I come along. So, anyway, so, I go happily, boom, billy, boom, billy, boom, billy, boom and jumping along, and of course, the lava crater crashes, and down, I go down, down, down, down, down and really bang up by me. And okay, I was starting to get a little better about three weeks ago and then, huh, I get the can-can, God knows why. I couldn't help myself and I tore off the muscle in the back so, on Tuesday I have an operation. Well, arthroscopic, you know, where they go in and do something about the utterly tore enough meniscus, you know, and such. So, that's why I'm limping a little bit. Anyway, the, the point of what happens here, huh, is that time is different, huh, you can have short periods of time, it goes subjectively to all the time you need. Let me show you, I'm gonna give you one minute a clock time, that's all. Equal subjectively to all the time you need to take a trip around the world, or something similar, go into the past, go into the future, do something outrageously, whatever it is. And I'm gonna hold the time. So, I'm going to give you one minute of clock time, equal subjectively to all the time you need, okay? Close your eyes, you can take a trip around the world, other trips into whatever you want. One minute of clock time equal subjectively all the time you need, beginning now. I'm holding the time. 

02:21:00

02:22:05
JEAN HOUSTON And the time is up, one minute. What happened? Why are laughing? What happened? Oh, poor soul. How many of you got around-- but didn't think it seemed to take a long time? How long? Subjectively, subjectively, how long? Yeah? A year? Did it feel like a year? Hmm? But did you do a lot of things? How many of you did a lot of things? But, how many of you didn't seem to be much longer than a minute? Okay. Now, you all, I believe you so much, it's interesting, you know. Uhm, yeah, as you do this, you get better and better at it. And then, you can do other things so that you can rehearse things, it doesn't have to be one minute, it can be three minutes, four minutes never more than five minutes. You can use an egg timer, you can go into the depths of yourself, the castle of your own possibilities and to your own inner cavern and there in it, a master of a skill, tennis, gulf, speaking, whatever. And be trained by the skill master, the skill partner in whatever, a language, a sport, anything, okay? But when you do it with time distortion or the amplified time, it tends to work very well because the time amplification inhibits the inhibitor. So, you don't have all those, mrrr, mrrr, mrrr, like, I didn't do it and all that, that doesn't work. So, just to let you know the time, you can use time, very, very differently. The only way that I can do that I did enormously very overly complicated life is by using this kind of technique, where I will have to write something, yeah, as it go of course. But I have to write something, but I write it, huh, I write the whole thing out and let's say, three to five minutes of clock time. And it's there so then I can type it out, whatever I do. You see? Well, if I have to learn things because of the nature of my work, working in so many cultures, uhm-hmm, ah, in many cultures, not all, but in many where there really is no English. I learned 500 to 1,000 words of the language. I have to, or else I'm not accepted. I have to cross the great divide of otherness and enter into their own lifestyles, their ways of knowing their ritual. We're sorry, very badly. That's always good because the little ladies come up, "Oh, sister, you look absolutely terrible and they got me working, oh my god!" But, uhm, uhm, my life requires me to be on a constant learning curve and the only way I can do it instead of saying, "All right, from six to nine in the morning, I'll study Sanskrit or something, really equally." So, it-- but, you know, it is actually a question of using time distortion, cuz in time distortion, you're working with the right or amplify time, you're working with the right hemisphere of the brain-- yes? And that is not no time. It's the left hemisphere that is clocked, the right hemisphere categories of time are restrain by the tensions of eternity. So, that the imagery and time distortion as you really practice it, and you see how many of you got it, you can do of many, many things, okay? Time. Now, of course, what happens is that the little dog who is the main character-- making things happen is able to scoot out, get the others, the tin man, the scarecrow, the lion and bring them up. And they use their mind, their heart, their courage, and they figure things out, and they able to rescue Dorothy. And of course, the witch still has a torch and so, she torches, who? The scarecrow and Dorothy picks up the water of life, throws it on. The scarecrow some gets on the witch, the water of life that causes her dissolve, where she says, "Oh, oh, who would have thought that such a little girl could destroy my beautiful wickedness." Remember that? That wonderful phrase and, of course, that's what happens. How do you bring the water of life to your school system, hmm? Your-- whatever, what do you have to bri-- bring the water of life to? Your practice is the water of life and knowing that it is, do rituals for God sake. Rituals of life giving water. Ritual comes from the word rita, rita, which means are discipline the dance that which illumines our transitions. When you do rituals, something ancient in the mind wakes up and carries you forward. You see? Rituals of divorce, so, that you move the relationship to another level. Rituals of friendship, where you'll be friend, formally, your best friend, you know. Anyone of you who my best friend is? Some of you know here. Kay Luz(ph). You know Kay Luz(ph)? She created the mystery school, she's one the great human beings. You know, she's-- I think she's 83 now. Anyway, also remember, we're living in a time in which ritual has been largely not there for us. One of the things I do around the world is help recreate rituals of puberty so that the kids can move from an outmoded state to a reality, and it's tough, and while put them in outward bound types of things and they, they learn all kinds of things and they come back with something real to do in the world, and they come back really grown. A lot of our rituals are sports, aren't they? Ah, football, the 11 young heroes carrying the holy egg through the womb of the gold post. While the ersatz origins dance and scream on the side, you know, so, so, that's always part of it. We need more rituals. So, when they finally bring the broom to the wizard, who is shocked, delighted and shocked, there has to be denizen. How many have noticed that? Denizen, at the point where you have done all the struggle merely got there, why? Why denizen, why? Why? Come back later and he says, "Why?" 

02:29:05
UNKNOWN So, you don't come back to... 

02:29:05
JEAN HOUSTON So, you, you know, so, you-- ah, you recognize your strength and you refuse, you saying, "No. We've done it." And, of course, the dog who has all the lines, goes and that what pulls back the curtain. "Oh, look at that man behind the curtain." But it's too late, and she-- and the artist says, "You are a very bad man." "No way, actually might there-- I'm a very good man, I'm just not a very good wizard." But he's a great psychotherapist and he gives each, and this is very important for you as therapist, symbols, powerful, powerful symbols, huh, of what they need. So, the tin man, gets what? Taking the heart, the cowardly lion gets-- is to let the courage gets, but thing, courage, and the scarecrow gets a doctorate of psychology. Symbols, do you ever give your patients or clients symbols of their therapy of where they are, what they becoming? But really a symbolic form, it's a very important idea if you do that. Huh, and then, of course, she-- Dor-- but what about Dorothy? And, of course, she says, "Well, I'll take you back to the world of (inaudible ) actually got here, ah, you know, a balloon." And so, he gets into it and what happens in that dog runs out again, chases the cat, the dog has always. Toto is the instrumentality throughout this whole thing. I'm a half-dog, myself, I was raised by a dog, so I really appreciate you, tell-- by the way, I do my hair-- there's a calling there somewhere, instead of this old lady band that I should wear, right? Anyway, uhm,-- yeah, it's like the (inaudible ). But, of course, she drops out and he says-- he says, "Come back." "I can't, I don't know how it works." I don't know how it works. So, something deeper when you know it doesn't know how to work something deeper has have to happen and of course, it does. And Glinda shows up, always there, always the great agency, the cosmic agency, the inteleki behind the scene and said, "You had it all the time, you had it all the time." That's the, the great message of the this incredible mythos, you had it in you all the time in, intelligence, heartfulness, courage, home, huh, and it was the ruby slippers, just click them three times and say...

02:31:55
JEAN HOUSTON Whatever, she is, and she wakes up. Now, in the book, she actually has transported back, it's only in the movies cuz they were little worried to what people have believed that they make it, having been a dream. But in the book, it continues because Oz and the kingdom of Oz, and the kingdom of Earth have been connected by Dorothy, which is the great hero-- heroines triumphed. The two have been able to connect the two worlds as my friend Joe used to say, "You become the master of two worlds, the world of space and time, and the world of the depths and that's what happens, this great story. When she says, "Huh, there's always like, ah,-- oh, and I saw there, I saw you and you, and you." And I didn't realize, but I do know it was all in my own backyard which is I said, the 1939 version of the collective unconscious of the human race, you see, which was there all the time. And the recognition that ultimately the wizard is us, that we have within us friends that which, huh, not which is filled with courage, filled with heart, filled with mind, filled with doggie brilliance and strength, filled with Dorothy. Dorothy, the gift of God in Greek. And we have the archetypes, the angels, we also have the great notice that keep us going, but the beauty of it is that, we are hugely inhabited, are we not? That we have within our set phenomenal treasure house of human psyche, that contains all of these patterns, all of these possibilities and that is the story of why the wizard is us
