The Military and PTSD: Counseling a Couple in Crisis With Joshua Taylor Psy.D.

00:00:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR Welcome. I'm Joshua Taylor, I'm a psychologist here in southern California, and today I'm gonna be talking about veterans. And I am a veteran. I served in the United States Air Force from 1992 to 1994. And so I'm gonna talk about some unique issues that are characteristic of veterans and their family members. These should be used, uh, for therapeutic purposes. They can be used to help you establish a rapport with veterans. There are some very unique things about, uh, veteran culture, things that veterans go through that make it very unique when working with someone who's been in the military. 

00:01:05
JOSHUA TAYLOR So let's start with that. What's it like to be in the military? I think the biggest thing that you have to understand when you're working with veterans is that they come from a very unique culture. From the minute they go into the service until when they come out of the service there are many, many things that they experience that really form part of their identity and how they view the world. 

00:01:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR So let me give you an example. When you enter into the service you essentially sign a check to the United States government that says payable up and to including your life. And that's a big commitment. Lot of people don't realize that it doesn't matter where you serve or what you're doing, at any time you can be called and sent into combat. And so that's really, really important to understand. 

00:01:45
JOSHUA TAYLOR So there's some very unique characteristics about working with veterans. It's really important to understand that they spend a significant amount of time going through essentially behavioral conditioning. They're taken from the civilian world and transformed into the military world. They're asked to do things physically and mentally that many people can never even imagine doing. And so it's really important to understand that when you first meet a veteran and when you start to work with a veteran that those characteristics may make it a little bit more difficult when you're trying to establish that initial rapport. 

00:02:20
JOSHUA TAYLOR When someone is deployed they are not given any choice. They're given a set of orders and asked to leave their family behind, sometimes in as little as a few days. And they may be gone for as long as a year, sometimes longer. This has a huge effect on the family. The family is then going to establish their own set of routines, their own set of ways of coping with that service member being gone. And then when that service member comes back they're thrust into this whole new world where they have their own idea of doing something and the family may have something completely different because they've had to adapt for the last 12 months to 15 months without that service member. Keep that in mind. It's really important to include that as part of the discussions when we start families in couples therapy with veterans and their family members. 

00:03:10
JOSHUA TAYLOR I want you to imagine that you leave your home, you fly halfway across the United State to a completely different state, and you are thrust into the middle of people yelling at you, lack of sleep, tremendous physical exertion, all kinds of just different and new experiences. It really throws your world into chaos. I'm gonna share a little about my experiences and hopefully you can take that and it will sensitize you to working with someone who's been in the military. 

00:03:45
JOSHUA TAYLOR When I left for the military at the age of 18 it was a whole new experience. I wound up in Texas, far from home, no family and no friends. You're thrust into this chaotic world of, uh, people yelling at you, lack of sleep, telling you what to do, where to go, how to do it, your head is shaved, your clothes are taken, you're given very strict instructions on how to live your life on a daily basis. And over time it really changes how you view the world and how you think. It becomes very structured and very regimented. And I think that that's an important thing to understand when working with veterans. They tend to be very structured and very regimented in their thinking. There's a saying within the United States Marine Corps that if the Marine Corps wanted a marine to have something, they would have issued it to them. I think that that really says a lot about veterans and how we see ourselves, uh, in the world. The military provides everything for us; without it, we might be lost. 

00:04:50
JOSHUA TAYLOR When you're trying to understand the perspective of someone who's been in the military, particularly somebody who's been in combat, I want you to think about a scenario. I want you to think about bullets flying by, explosions going off, and what would you do? A lot of people tend to run away from crisis, run away from chaos. For us veterans, we've been trained, been conditioned, if you will, to run towards it. 

00:05:15
JOSHUA TAYLOR You're gonna need to have a very high tolerance for anger. You're gonna have to have a high tolerance for profanity. They tend to come in, um, very, very distrustful of someone who hasn't been in service. They also tend to be very trustful of someone who has been in the service. Now, that doesn't mean you can't be effective if you've never served in the military, but it does mean you have to take a little bit of extra care when establishing that rapport. 

00:05:45
JOSHUA TAYLOR Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. The Department of Defense estimates that anywhere from 40 to 60% of our current veterans returning from combat today will have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. That's an incredibly large number. I want you to keep something in mind. If you've been stationed overseas and you've been away from family and friends for nine months, a year, two years, and now all of a sudden you've come back to the United States to be with your family and friends and someone hands you a questionnaire to screen for PTSD, are you really interested in taking the time to talk about your sleep disturbances and your nightmares? Probably not. You probably wanna get home, you wanna spend time with your friends, you wanna see your family. You're not gonna be necessarily completely truthful with that questionnaire. So I think that the estimate of 40 to 60% is probably accurate, but it's probably a bit higher. If someone's been deployed multiple times in a combat zone, you can bet they're gonna have some very significant issues to deal with when they come home and are trying to readjust to civilian life. 

00:06:55
PTSD in the Military is highly under recognized and under-diagnosed. Often Military Veterans are reluctant to seek treatment and concerned that they may appear weak. 

00:06:55
NARRATOR PTSD in vets is highly under-diagnosed. Oftentimes military personnel are fearful of being seen as weak and don't want to come forward to seek treatment. 

00:07:05
DSM-IV TR DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA 

00:07:05
A. TRAUMATIC STRESSOR 

00:07:05
An event, or events, in which an individual experiences, witnesses, or is confronted with life endangerment, death, or serious injury or threat to self or others; and 

00:07:05
The individual responds to the experience with feelings of intense fear, horror, or helplessness 

00:07:10
NARRATOR The DSM-IV's diagnostic criteria for PTSD is that there must be a traumatic stressor, an event or events in which an individual experiences, witness, or is confronted with life endangerment, death, or serious injury or threat to self or others. And the individual must respond to the experience with feelings of intense fear, horror, or helplessness. 

00:07:35
B. RE-EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS (1 or more) 

00:07:35
Intrusive recollections Distressing dreams Flashbacks Dissociative phenomenon Psychological and physical distress with reminders of the event 

00:07:35
NARRATOR The second criteria is re-experiencing one or more of the following symptoms: intrusive recollections, distressing dreams, flashbacks, dissociative phenomenon, psychological and physical distress with reminders of the event. 

00:07:50
C. AVOIDANCE AND NUMBING SYMPTOMS (3 or more) 

00:07:50
Avoidance of thoughts, feelings, or conversations associated with the event Avoidance of places, situations, or people that are reminiscent of the event Inability to recall important aspects of the event Diminished interest Estrangement from others Restricted range of affect Sense of a foreshortened future 

00:07:55
NARRATOR There must be three or more of avoidance and numbing symptoms, including avoidance of thoughts, feelings, or conversations associated with the event, avoidance of places, situations, or people that are reminiscent of the event, inability to recall important aspects of the event, diminished interest, estrangement from others, restricted range of affect, and a sense of foreshortened future. 

00:08:20
D. HYPERAROUSAL SYMPTOMS (2 or more) 

00:08:20
Sleep disruption Impaired concentration Irritability or anger outbursts Hypervigilance Exaggerated startle reaction 

00:08:20
NARRATOR Two or more of the following hyperarousal symptoms may be present: sleep disruption, impaired concentration, irritability or anger outbursts, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response. 

00:08:35
E. MINIMUM SYMPTOM DURATION OF 1 MONTH 

00:08:35
F. SYMPTOMS CAUSE DISTRESS OR FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT 

00:08:35
NARRATOR In order to meet this diagnostic criteria, there must be a minimum of one month of symptoms and the symptoms must cause significant distress or functional impairment. 

00:08:45
PRESENTATION 

00:08:45
Multiple somatic complaints Suicidal ideation: active or passive Various sleep difficulties Frequent visits to the emergency room Mood lability hallucinations Impulsivity Relationship difficulties 

00:08:45
NARRATOR It is helpful to recognize how military with PTSD may initially present in counseling. There may be multiple somatic complaints, suicide ideation, either active or passive, various sleep difficulties, frequent visits to the emergency room, mood lability, hallucinations, impulsivity, and relationship difficulties. 

00:09:10
DIAGNOSIS DEPENDS ON SYMPTOMS DURATION 

00:09:10
Less than 1 month: Acute Stress Disorder 1-3 months: Acute PTSD 3 months or longer: Chronic PTSD 

00:09:10
NARRATOR A PTSD diagnosis depends on symptom duration. Less than one month is Acute Stress Disorder. One to three months; Acute PTSD. Three months or longer; Chronic PTSD. 

00:09:25
RECOGNITION OF PTSD 

00:09:25
Still poorly recognized in primary care settings Often goes unrecognized by psychiatrists Trauma history not explored due to time constraints, victim not ready to disclose or providers' discomfort with the topic High rate of comorbidity and symptoms overlap with other psychiatric disorders 

00:09:25
NARRATOR PTSD is still poorly recognized in primary care settings. It often goes unrecognized by psychiatrists. The reason for this is the trauma history may not be explored due to time constraints. The victim may not be ready to disclose. Also, providers may feel uncomfortable with this topic. There's a very high rate of comorbidity and symptom overlap with other psychiatric disorders. 

00:09:55
COMORBID DISORDERS 

00:09:55
Major Depression Substance disorders Panic disorder/Agoraphobia Generalized Anxiety disorder Obsessive-compulsive disorder Social phobia Bipolar disorder Personality disorders 

00:09:55
NARRATOR Common comorbid disorders for PTSD are major depression, substance disorders, panic disorder, agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social phobia, bipolar disorder, and personality disorders. 

00:10:15
AGGRESSION IN PTSD 

00:10:15
Increase in anger and expressions of hostility - displacement Role of comorbid substance abuse - could be the cause of anger Role of social isolation - avoid confrontation -> increase anger -> fear of loss of control -> isolation 

00:10:15
NARRATOR It is not uncommon to find an increase in aggression in military personnel struggling with PTSD. There may be an increase in anger and expressions of hostility. The role of comorbid substance abuse can be the cause of anger. In this negative cycle social isolation can lead to avoiding confrontation, therefore increasing the anger, increasing fear of loss of control, and further increasing isolation. 

00:10:50
JOSHUA TAYLOR When I was 18 and at my first duty station the very first thing that my squad mates did when we got off our first, uh, shift was to go out and, and to drink. And not just to drink a little but to drink a lot. 

00:11:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR Within the United States military there are some very distinct branches of the service. Each of these branches has a very unique mission and that can really help you when you're trying to establish a rapport with someone who's been in the military. For example, myself, I was in the United States Air Force. Our mission is very, very different than the Navy or the Marine Corp or the Army. So I really encourage you to do your research, read up, become familiar with what each branch of service does. They're very distinct and they're very, and they're very unique. They each have their own special characteristics which will allow you to understand and work with the veteran more affectively. It may take time. If you haven't served in the military, they're gonna naturally be a little bit suspicious, and they may not necessarily understand that you have their best interests at heart. For veterans, they have been told from the time they were in basic training to the time that they got out that they're a warrior, that they're supposed to be strong, that they're supposed to be there for their friends, and that the idea or even the concept of being weak or showing weakness is very foreign to them, so it's really important to take a little bit of extra time to encourage them and, and reinforce the idea that it takes a tremendous amount of strength for someone to come in, particularly when they've been injured and the injury is very hard to see, something like PTSD or traumatic brain injury. 

00:12:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR It's really important that when you're working with a veteran to include the families. Many times veterans are so used to having to do things on their own or do things in a military context that they don't always realize that bringing in that family and that support system can be very valuable when you're trying to establish a therapeutic relationship or you're working on issues within therapy. 

00:12:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR When you're designing your treatment plan, when you're looking at your interventions, people that come from the military are used to very short, simple, achievable tasks and goals. You wanna keep your interventions very focused. You wanna allow them to have very small successes and build upon those. It's really, really important not to try and do too much too early when you're working with a veteran. Give them some very small, very substantial short-term things to do that will help establish the rapport and make your therapy more effective. 

00:13:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR Everything from a cook to a combat engineer to a sniper, within the military there are so many jobs that it really mirrors a lot of the things that we may do in civilian life. Ask, and find out what exactly did a person do. You will find that not everybody that's been in the military has necessarily been in combat. But those that have been in combat or have a very special type of job may have some unique characteristics, and I'll explain. 

00:13:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR It's important to understand that the bulk of the fighting, the bulk of the combat within a particular war, is carried out by the Marine Corps and the Army. The Navy, the Air Force, the Coastguard, they're not gonna have a whole lot of hands-on combat. Not that there aren't elements within those branches of service that do combat, there are. But primarily, at large, you're gonna see mostly the Marines and the Army. So if you're interested in working with veterans, it's really important to do your research and become familiar with each of those branches of service so that you can have an understanding of their unique missions and the things that they're asking those young men and women to do. 

00:14:40
JOSHUA TAYLOR If you haven't spent a lot of time working with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, how do you know? How do you know if the person sitting in front of you may or may not have PTSD? Very simple, what is their body telling them? The body is an excellent source of information. If they're having sleep difficulties, agitation, easily startled, they're avoiding things that they normally wouldn't, they're really changed. And you'll get this information from friends and family. But primarily the body, what's the body telling them? How are they sleeping? Can they fall asleep? Can they stay asleep? Do they have nightmares? Are these nightmares recurring? Are the nightmares following a particular theme or pattern? As you hear these stories from veterans and you hear these symptoms, if you start to see what the body is telling them, it's probably a pretty good bet that they've got Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. 

00:15:40
JOSHUA TAYLOR So today you're gonna meet a veteran and his spouse and I'm gonna show you some of the different techniques that you can use to help establish that rapport, but also some ways where you can take the stress level of that veteran and really start to bring it down. One of the biggest keys in treating someone with PTSD and even TBI is really addressing those, that fight-or-flight response, trying to bring the stress levels down, give them some very concrete tools that they can use to deescalate to get back into the cognitive side of things and less of the emotional side of things. 

00:16:15
JOSHUA TAYLOR So Chris, you had called and made an appointment to come in, um, you told me a little bit about what's going on, but kinda give me a little bit of background about what brings you in today. 

00:16:30
CHRIS Okay, um, well, it's something I've been wanting to do for a while. I've heard that, um, counseling would be good and I, I have seen counseling in the past, you know, by myself. Um, but lately, uh, Dan's been, um, I think on edge and, and I've been on edge and so, um, I thought it would be good for both of us to come in together and, and maybe talk through, yeah, just these things. 

00:17:05
JOSHUA TAYLOR Dan, your wife had mentioned that, um, you were in the army and I'd, she had, one of the reasons she had called my office was that I specialized in working with veterans. I happened to be in the Air Force. Um, tell me a little bit about why, um, why you're here. 

00:17:25
DAN Well, um, I'm here because, you know, she wanted me to come. Um, um, I'm, I'm not sleeping that well. You know, um, yeah, I'm having some problems sleeping and, um, it makes me kind of irritable. 

00:17:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. Chris, what are some of the things that you've noticed about Dan's, uh, sleep patterns? 

00:18:05
CHRIS Well, I think he's just not sleeping and so he wakes up, um, in the morning, maybe after what feels like 10 minutes of sleeping and, um, I think it leads to more drinking at night so that he can go to bed. Um, so I think that there's this pattern of drinking to try to sleep but then not really being able to and, so, um, I don't think he feels rested and then during the day he's not rested at all, so. 

00:18:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR Dan, can you take me though, take me though a typical evening. What, what's your typical evening for you, just as it relates to how your sleeping. 

00:19:00
DAN Well, um, you know, I have dinner and then, um, watch some TV. Um, you know, have some beers, and, um, I don't know, if we don't go out and do anything, you know, um, um, maybe fall asleep on the couch a little bit and then, um, um, eventually make my way to the bed. Um, sometimes I'll, you know, if I can't get to sleep when I get back to bed I'll read or play, you know, video games or something. Um, but, um, you know, I, um, I wake up and I'll sleep a little bit and then I'll wake up. Sometimes I have, um, sometimes I have nightmares and, and I, I wake up. And sometimes I just can't sleep, you know, and, yeah. 

00:20:10
JOSHUA TAYLOR If you had to put a, a number to it, you know, an average, how many hours from the, from the first time you're able to fall asleep to the first time you wake up, how many hours is that? 

00:20:25
DAN Um, probably on average maybe like, three, maybe, sometimes less, sometimes more, sometimes four hours is a pretty good night, you know, but, yeah. 

00:20:35
JOSHUA TAYLOR And after that initial, once you wake up, are you able to go back to sleep or do you find yourself kind of up the rest of the night, restless? What, what's going on at that point? 

00:20:50
DAN Yeah, I'm usually, um, I have a hard time getting back to sleep, that's the thing. So if it's like, you know, 4:00 in the morning and I, it's still dark outside and I can't sleep, I don't, you know, like I feel tired, but I'm not, I can't, I don't know, I just can't sleep. 

00:21:10
JOSHUA TAYLOR So, correct me if I'm wrong, it sounds like about three is about the average per night? 

00:21:15
DAN Yeah. 

00:21:15
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. All right. So, Christine, you had mentioned that there was kind of an issue with some the, the drinking. Tell me what's going on. 

00:21:30
CHRIS I think it's a little too much. 

00:21:35
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. 

00:21:35
CHRIS So, you know, a couple beers, uh, some, some wine with dinner I think is fine and normal. Um, but he'll sit there sometimes, watching TV and drinking a lot. Or anytime we're out, it's not just a few beers, it, it leads to more and more and, um, yeah, it gets uncomfortable and I, you know, um, he'll sometimes stay on the computer for a long time and he'll play video games and there's a lot of drinking. So I think there's just, I feel like there's an increase, um, that I've not seen before. 

00:22:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. So Dan, tell me, um, when, when you hear that, what do you, what do you, what's your, what's your response? What do you think about that? This idea that Christine has kind of observed something here? 

00:22:40
DAN Yeah, well, um, she's not wrong. 

00:22:45
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. 

00:22:45
DAN Um, you know, yeah, I, you know, I probably could drink less, you know, and, um, try not to, try not to drink too much. You know, sometimes I have a couple too many. Um, you know, like she said, it's hard though, you know, I can't, I can't sleep and I don't know. 

00:23:20
JOSHUA TAYLOR You had mentioned that, that, that you were having a hard time sleeping. Uh, when did you, uh, come back? 

00:23:30
DAN Well, it's been, um, six months? Six months. 

00:23:35
JOSHUA TAYLOR So it's been about six months and, um, and so did you notice this change in terms of your sleep patterns in the last six months or has it been longer than that? 

00:23:50
DAN I don't know. I guess I noticed it maybe earlier, but, um, it's, uh, seems like it's worse now. I don't know. Yeah, it's definitely worse now. 

00:24:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR So it maybe started when, when you were in, when you were in Iraq. 

00:24:10
DAN Yeah, maybe. Yeah. I mean, I guess I just didn't notice. I mean, yeah. 

00:24:15
JOSHUA TAYLOR Your wife had mentioned on the phone that, uh, you had been deployed three times. 

00:24:20
DAN Yeah. 

00:24:20
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. So Dan, what I'd like to do is I'd like to just ask you a series of just yes or no questions because it will help me kind of get an idea kinda where you're at, maybe some of the things that are going on, um, and that allows me to really work with both of you in coming up with some strategies and a plan that, that work best for you. So, um, I'm just gonna ask a few questions, kinda give me a yes or no, okay? All right, uh, in the last six months, uh, have you had any nightmares that are, uh, been consistently recurring, meaning you have them on a consistent basis? So, once a week, uh, maybe twice a week. 

00:25:00
DAN Yes. 

00:25:05
JOSHUA TAYLOR Do you find yourself getting angry at situations that maybe normally wouldn't cause you to get angry? 

00:25:15
DAN Yeah. 

00:25:15
JOSHUA TAYLOR Are you easily startled? 

00:25:20
DAN No, I don't think so. 

00:25:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR Do you find yourself, uh, no longer enjoying things that you used to enjoy? 

00:25:30
DAN Yeah. 

00:25:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR Do you find large crowds uncomfortable? 

00:25:35
DAN Yeah, a little bit. 

00:25:40
JOSHUA TAYLOR You know, one of the things that we've really started to understand about folks who've been deployed multiple times is this concept of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. And I'm sure you've probably heard that term. 

00:25:55
DAN Yeah. 

00:25:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR Tell me what it means to you. 

00:26:00
[sil.] 

00:26:05
DAN You know, I don't know, um, um, I don't, feeling stressed out, like feeling, um, yeah, feeling super stressed out? 

00:26:15
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. Christine, you know, when you hear some of these things, uh, from Dan, um, what's your perspective? I mean, when you, you listen to what he's saying here, um, what are you thinking, what are you feeling right now? 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:26:45
CHRIS He's different. 

00:26:45
JOSHUA TAYLOR Yeah. 

00:26:45
CHRIS He does get angry really easily. I don't know how to help him and I feel like he doesn't want me to help him. So. 

00:27:10
JOSHUA TAYLOR Yeah. 

00:27:10
CHRIS When he's having nightmares I don't know, like he, like he wants me to help him and I don't know what to say or ask or. 

00:27:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. Dan, I have a question. When you were in the, the Army, um, were you ever physically injured? 

00:27:30
DAN No. 

00:27:35
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. I mean, you know, I remember even when I was in basic training, you know, you pull a muscle or, you know, I mean, any type of injury, you know, where you. 

00:27:45
DAN Oh, yeah. I mean, yeah, like that. Yeah. 

00:27:50
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. Um, did you get it, go to sick bay, did you go to the corpsman, I mean, what happened to you? Get treated at all? 

00:28:00
DAN Yeah, I mean, I sprained my knee so, you know. 

00:28:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. You know, one of the things that's really interesting about PTSD is that it's really, really difficult to see. It happens someplace that is very hard to detect, that's in our brain. And one of things we like to do, particularly for, for those of us who've been in the military is, you know, we kind of always told, you know, pull your boots up, you know, keep going, keep moving forward. Uh, we don't generally like to ask for help. We have this, I mean, it's the warrior's code. You know, it's kind of what we live by. And yet when we're injured physically, uh, it's very easy for us to see that injury and, and feel it and go to see, you know, sick call or the med, the surgeon and, and take care of it. When it's something that has to do with kind of how we feel or how we're responding to things, it's not always as easy because we really don't know what's, I guess the good news is, is a lot of the things that you have described, it's your body's normal way of coping with what has happened. You know, when the body undergoes, uh, an extreme set of circumstances it responds in a way that's designed to protect itself. So your ability, the heightened vigilance, you know, this kind of always being on edge, that's your body trying to protect itself, and it feels very abnormal, I would imagine. It feels very unsettling and yet, that's the, that's a very normal type of response. So it's really important to understand that. I think it's important to realize that Post Traumatic Stress Disorder isn't something that needs to be hidden, necessarily, in a closet. There's a lot of, uh, generals, there's a lot of, you know, very famous military personnel who have talked about it and who have kind of come out and discussed kind of some of the things that can happen. And what I want you to think about kind of in the coming days is this concept of an injury, right? If you were to be on patrol and step in a ditch and break your ankle, okay? And what would you do? You, you've just broken your ankle. What, what would be the steps, what would, what would you do in that situation? 

00:30:40
DAN Well, I mean, you know, depends on where you are, but I'd get someplace safe and then, um, you know, go find a medic and get it checked out. Get x-rays and then, um, if it's broken then you need a cast and that kind of thing. 

00:31:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR So is it fair to say that you probably wouldn't spend a week, two weeks, three weeks, walking around on a broken ankle? 

00:31:10
DAN Yeah, sure. I mean, if you know it's broken, sure. 

00:31:15
JOSHUA TAYLOR All right. But you can see that as an injury, right? 

00:31:20
DAN Yeah. 

00:31:20
JOSHUA TAYLOR Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is an injury. It's a lot harder to see. It's a lot harder to, for us, in some cases, to treat, but it's still an injury. And I want to remind you of that. And so as, you know, when, when you're out there, you know, in the coming days, in the coming weeks, as we go through this process, keep in mind that you were injured. And it's not weakness, it's not, uh, a lack of strength or a lack of courage. It's really an injury. And I think it takes a tremendous amount of courage to come in here with your wife and to sit down, particularly with a stranger, and talk about some of the things that, uh, I can imagine this being extremely personal and very powerful and important to you. I want you to keep that in mind in terms of the concept of an injury, okay? 

00:32:20
JOSHUA TAYLOR Christine, tell me a little bit about what it was like for you, um, when Dan was gone. You know, tell me what the, your daily routine was like, you know, and how has that changed now that he's back? 

00:32:35
CHRIS Well, because it's been a few times, I'm, I'm used to it. When he leaves I, I get back into my own routine and I go to the gym and, um, you know, I go out with friends a lot and I take care of the house and, you know, our pets and, um, you know, I try to, try to Skype and do video chatting when possible and, um, you know, but a lot of, a lot of days will go and I just have my routine, so. And when he's back, um, it's been different each time. So this time it feels tougher. It just feels like it's gotten tougher and tougher. 

00:33:35
JOSHUA TAYLOR Yeah. 

00:33:40
CHRIS So, uh, I'm not, I'm not, I, I, I didn't realize it had been so many months 'cuz it, it feels like we're still trying to adjust back and I don't know, when I say "back," you know, it's, I get used to my own routine so it's, it's like two different routines. 

00:34:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR Dan, what's it like for you, you know, now that you're no longer in the Army and coming back and, and, what's it like? 

00:34:15
DAN Well, um, I mean, it's pretty different, um, from being, you know, in. Um. 

00:34:30
[sil.] 

00:34:35
DAN I don't know, I guess it's kinda hard to get used to. Um, you know, I don't know. Um, it's different and I wish I felt more, you know, comfortable or. 

00:35:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR Yeah. 

00:35:05
DAN Yeah. 

00:35:05
JOSHUA TAYLOR Sounds like it's really difficult to kinda readjust. 

00:35:10
DAN Yeah. Yeah, um, yeah, sure. You know, and seems like it's, I don't know if it's like, out of normal or whatever, but, I mean, it just, you know, can be still hard. 

00:35:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR Yeah. If you had to put your, uh, how you feel right now in terms of an overall sense of, maybe stress or agitation on a scale of one to ten, where do you feel yourself at right now? 

00:35:50
DAN I don't know, like maybe eight or nine, maybe. 

00:35:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR Pretty high? 

00:35:55
DAN Well, yeah, I mean. Like, yeah. We're here in this place. I mean, that's, but yeah. Yeah. 

00:36:05
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. One of the things that I think is really important is I always try to give my clients something that they can leave with, something that you can use. It's generally very simple on a day-to-day basis to lower that sense of anxiety or lower that sense of agitation. You know, um, as we go through this process it's important to understand that there is no definitive, uh, right way or wrong way to kind of do things or, or really address things. That you're here and that's really kind of the first step in, in, um, trying to feel better. If, if I were to tell you that there are some things that we can do that would allow you to, without medication, but would essentially allow you to not have the nightmares and sleep, uh, you know, six to eight hours every night, how does that sound to you? 

00:37:10
DAN Well, yeah, I mean, of course. 

00:37:10
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. So it sounds like you're, you're willing to kind of go through this process with, with Chris and really kind of explore about what's going on and maybe try and come to some sort of solution on sleeping a little bit better and understanding maybe some of the nature of, of being injured in a way that's a bit different than some of the physical injuries that we sometimes, that sometimes happen to us. 

00:37:40
DAN Yeah, sure. Yeah. 

00:37:40
JOSHUA TAYLOR Great. So what I want you to do is, you had said that you're about an eight or a nine in terms of your overall agitation. Okay? I want you to just kinda take a moment and just notice kind of the couch that your sitting on. Notice how it feels, all right, and what I want you to do is as you're sitting there and as you're, you're listening to, you know, the sensations within your body, I want you to kind of describe for me in as much detail as you can everything about the couch that you're on right now. 

00:38:20
DAN Um, okay. Um, it's like a, um, you know, plasticy, leather, silver-gray couch. Um, has little blue pillows on it and, uh, look like flower patterns and, um, has a low back that's kinda green, cloth, um. It's pretty comfortable. Soft and, uh, wish it had a higher back, but it's not too bad. Um, yeah. 

00:39:20
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. What do you notice on the walls here in my office? 

00:39:25
DAN Um, you got a, uh, picture, framed picture, some kinda art. Uh, a thermostat. And then a monitor, TV. You've got a mirror. Some kind of whiteboard, something. Curtains. 

00:40:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR Good. When you look at the picture on the wall, can you describe it in as, in as much detail as you can to me? 

00:40:10
DAN It's a, um, looks like a picture of, uh, I don't know, dots, like multicolored dots or balls or something. Um, maybe like paint splotches. 

00:40:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR Good. 

00:40:25
DAN And it's in a white frame, border. Has like a wood, simple thin wood frame. That's kind of brown, stained. Maybe pine or something. 

00:40:40
JOSHUA TAYLOR Good, good. And what color is the paint on the wall? 

00:40:50
DAN Uh, some kind of green, greenish, um, little bit of, um, you know, gold or yellowish in it, um, yeah, kind of like, uh, olivey, maybe. Little olive. 

00:41:05
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. And the carpet? 

00:41:05
DAN Um, mostly, uh, like, aqua. It's kinda like stripy and, uh, it has some blues, but a lot of green. Some, uh, different kinds of little bit of yellow. It's predominantly like, aqua blue or green. 

00:41:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay. Now what I want you to do is just kind of take notice and tell me where your agitation is right now. 

00:41:40
[sil.] 

00:41:45
DAN Well, I'm, yeah, I'm, I'm a little bit less agitated. Uh. 

00:41:50
JOSHUA TAYLOR Good. 

00:41:50
DAN Yeah, I don't know number-wise, but, I mean, I don't feel as. 

00:41:55
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay, good. This is something that you can do when you start to get a sense that things might be getting out of control or you're feeling a little bit stressed out. And what it allows you to do is it allows you to move away from some of the emotional pieces of what you're feeling into more of the cognitive and some of the, the thinking, logical pieces that, that we want you to kind of access. What happens a lot of times is when we get very emotional, our thinking centers start to kind of shut down and we don't necessarily make sometimes the best decisions. By taking notice of our surroundings and really thinking about it and describing it in detail, and this is something that you can do as a couple for both of you, it allows you to kind of access those more thinking sides of our brain which then lower the emotion and help us make sometimes better decisions. Does that, does that kind of help in a sense? You know, something that you can kind of take with you to, to get more kind of away from that extreme emotion and into some of the thinking sides? 

00:43:05
DAN Yeah, sure. 

00:43:05
JOSHUA TAYLOR Okay, good. Good. And you know, as we kind of finish up today I really wanted to, Dan, thank you for your service. I mean, you know, I know we hear it all the time, but I think it's really important that, well, we continue to say that. You know, it's, it's really a small community of folks that decide to, to volunteer and put themselves on the line for their friends, their family, their country, and that's something that really should be celebrated. And, you know, it's important that you realize that these types of things are extremely treatable. You know, the sleep disorders, the agitation, you know, the difficulty with large crowds. Does that mean that you have PTSD? We won't know yet. You know, this is kind of the first part. Think of it as the first stage of, uh, a long process in trying to figure out exactly what's going on, giving you the best information that we have so that you can make the most informed decision possible. And that's really what it's all about. I'm not gonna tell you how to think or how to feel or what you should or shouldn't do. Uh, I'm gonna offer solutions and work with you as partners, if you will, to develop a plan that allows you to get back to where it is that you wanna be. We really can kind of create our, our own tomorrow, if you will. So I know that there's a lot of things you, you, you've been, you're gonna be feeling, there's gonna be a lot of questions, and what I really encourage you to do is, is to talk about some of those things, write them down, and bring them in next time so that we can kind of begin this process of, uh, finding out exactly what's going on and get the best solution possible. Um, any questions that you might have for me? 

00:45:10
DAN No. Do you have anything? 

00:45:15
CHRIS Um, uh, do we, should we plan on coming in once a week or once every two weeks, or? 

00:45:25
JOSHUA TAYLOR What do you think, Dan? 

00:45:30
[sil.] 

00:45:35
JOSHUA TAYLOR Now, I can give you the good and the bad of both, but, I mean, really, you know, um, I always like to hear from you and, and kinda use that as a, a baseline. 

00:45:45
DAN Well, um, maybe we could make it every two and then see if it's better to do more or less. Is that, I mean? 

00:46:00
JOSHUA TAYLOR Yeah. What I would like you to do, though, is keep in mind that if something changes, because two weeks is a long time. A lot can happen. And if something does change, please feel free to call, all right? And we can, we can really work to get you in sooner, you know? And we'll just go from there. We'll start from that point and then we'll do our best to, to get you in the right place. Okay? 

00:46:25
CHRIS Okay. 

00:46:30
DAN All right. 

00:46:30
CHRIS Okay. 

00:46:30
JOSHUA TAYLOR Thank you. 

00:46:30
CHRIS Thank you. 

00:46:35
JOSHUA TAYLOR Dan and Christine are a very typical couple, dealing with these issues of post-deployment. As you can see, Dan is having some severe sleep disturbances and these are playing a very significant role in their relationship. One of the things that we wanna work on is trying to normalize what's going on, but also get Dan into some regular treatment so that we can address some of his sleep disturbances which lowers his arousal state and allows him to process more of what's going on, rather than react to what's going on emotionally. 

00:47:05
JOSHUA TAYLOR As a veteran, I think it's important that we remember that young men and women put their lives on the line for us, and we owe it to them to do our very best to give them complete and comprehensive treatment and to really work with them in a collaborative fashion so that they return to a sense of normalcy. I think that's, that that is the least that we can do to repay them for all the sacrifices that they have made for us.
