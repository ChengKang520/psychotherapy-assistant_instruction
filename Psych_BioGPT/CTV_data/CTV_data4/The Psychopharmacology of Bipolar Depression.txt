CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS Hello, and welcome. I am Dr. Cyrus Marcellus Ellis, a (inaudible ) professor here at Governors State University in the Counselor Education and Supervision Faculty. I've been at this university for 15 years. I'm also an alumni of the University of Virginia, and the Curry School of Education. Not to mention, I'm a vet of the United States Army for 20 years. Welcome to this topic on the Psychopharmacology of Bi-Polar Depression. And welcome to you. This course is about understanding the Psychopharmacology of bi-polar depression. Now, we must focus on the fact that I'm using a word that a lot of people take for granted, bi-polar depression, depression(ph). They're not the same thing. To understand the difference between the two, let's first start with what this is really all about from a basic level. To use the term Psychopharmacology really means two things. The first thing is that we want to understand the psychology of an individual, how they approach something. Whether they're apprehensive about it or whether they're happy about it. It is really the psychology of anything. So, that's step one, understanding the psychology of… of the individual. Now, pharmacology really is about a particular medications and how those medications are made, how do we use them and most importantly, what kind of side effects can a person expect to experience from taking the medication. So, that's really the first step. How we understand medications and how we approach medications as people. And second, what will the medication actually do when we take it for a particular purpose. So, we got to keep that in mind as we have this discussion and… and… and go through this learning about bi-polar depression and it's Psychopharmacology. Second, a key piece to this understanding will be the mechanism that kind of drives all of this in terms of clients and what work we're trying to do to help them lead a more effective and more adaptive quality of life. And that is that this medication isn't like a spray on band-aids where you can kind of see what goes on. This kind of medication, this kind of approach really deals with how the brain works. The brain being the center of all that we all know that we do, we really have to understand that. So, in a basic sense we want to understand that the brain has within it a lot of path waves. These path waves is how the brain communicates throughout and to the rest of the body. Because of that, it sends its messages not with paper and pencil or uh… through carrier pigeon type understanding, it really sends messages through chemicals. And if everything is working correctly then the brain will send its messages with the right amount of chemicals and passing through various processes, so that the body can operate correctly. When that is inhibited or when that is out of regulation, certain issues arise. One of those issues is bi-polar depression. Now, let's make sure we understand when we talk about bi-polar depression, we're not confusing ourselves with depression. You see, in lay talk, depression is a word thrown around by a great many people and sometimes, well, I understand the experience isn't really depression is of clinical concern to people like us. So, we want to make sure we understand what we're saying when we're using these particular words because they carry a lot of weight and it also carries a lot of importance. When we talk depression, we're talking about emotional disturbance. Now, usually over a period of time, and we're talking weeks to months versus a day to a weekend. We're talking about their changes in how we act, their changes in the way we find interest, their changes in the way we focus and concentrate and go throughout our daily lives. In one sense we're… we might be very nice people regularly, but when depression is upon us we are bit more irritated, a bit more short with people, we might sleep a little longer or for some, not sleep as much as we used to, depending on where the symptoms are. That's why we understand these pieces when we enquire with our clientele what they've been going through over a period of weeks to a month or more. Bi-polar depression is a little bit different and in some areas drastically different. Bi-polar depression, while it can be characterized by some one of things I've already said or more characterized by extensive mood swings. You see, I'm moving my body left to right because the mood swings of someone suffering from bi-polar depression are quite extreme. To being very, very, very energetic, feeling as if you can conquer anything, you could run a triathlon in a morning and then build a house in the afternoon, that kind of sense that all things are at your fingertips. And then the next extreme is where you don't want to move. You don't want to get out of bed, you don't seek to do particular, what we call activities of daily living, you don't seek to brush your teeth, you don't seek to shower, do other forms of personal hygiene. And you might be in that state for significant amount of time. So, bi-polar depression has us in these extreme highs and these extreme lows of depression. As we'll learn as this… this topic goes on there might be other pieces added to that at the extreme highs or the extreme lows that really set apart bi-polar depression from depression. So again, we're focusing on bi-polar depression. When we re-examine the path waves that allow us to be regulated, we're talking about neurotransmitters, we're talking about the way the brain operates and send messages throughout all of our neural path waves. Bi-polar depression, unlike what we call clinical depression, is again biologically or organically totally different. In depression, you have a lack of particular neurotransmitters that the body is producing and the body needs help in using the neurotransmitters that it does have at its disposal. Well, with by bi-polar depression you have periods where you have an overflow of particular neurotransmitters at the brain's disposal. So it's like where you might need, by example, 30 or 40 neurotransmitters to be happy, you now have an overflow of that. They're firing at increased rates and the body is like, wow, what am I supposed to do with all this extra stuff, I got to find a way to do something with it, I'll just start going all over the place, I'll feel this energy and use it. And that will last for a particular amount of time. But with bi-polar depression that doesn't sustain itself. So then you'll move into a period of regularity, but then you'll keep moving to a period of this extreme low where now where 30 or 40 might had been regular and then when you're at your extreme high, you had an overflow, now with this extreme low, you're down to 10 or 12, by example. Now you don't have enough to carry yourself through and it to be used so that you can meet your daily needs. This is where the extreme low has come in, this is where you see outwardly individuals who don't get up out of bed, the alarm clock just goes on and on and on, and they're staying… they're staying flat and not engaging in their daily activities, not seeking to go to work, not seeking to pay their taxes, not seeking to address the leaky faucet or the crack in the window. All of those activities just go unattended. That extreme low keeps them in that lethargic and disconnect from the world position. And that's really where the difference between depression and bi-polar depression are there. Once again, characterized by the extremes of the very high and the very lows. In our particular profession we talk of two types of bi-polar depression, also characterized by particular symptom. You have a Type One, that is not often seen as much as Type Two is. Type One really only contains that hypo-manic phase, not as characteristic of the extreme lows when you are Type One bi-polar. Type Two, well that's much as we've already talked about, where you have the extreme highs, and the extreme lows. That's really what people see a great deal of. And again, the trouble in decision making, the trouble in managing your day-to-day routine, the trouble with your ability to manage other depressive symptoms. And a greater more eye-catching and certainly more of a clinical concern for us is the suicide ideation that really earmarks the Type Two bi-polar depression. We must keep our eye on that. And again, that's one of those signs and symptoms that we have to focus on. The pharmacology really goes to the issue of the best way to treat the bi-polar depression. If organically we have an overflow of neurotransmitters and we also then have a lack of neurotransmitters that earmark the very highs and the very lows, the pharmacology says let's create an intervention that goes to the arena that would help regulate a now disregulated system. And that really brings about a big, big question. The pharmacology of what's best for bi-polar depression in terms of, will this medication work better than this medication? The science is not yet complete on understanding how this medication really, really, really makes a difference. So, the pharmacology begins with uses and also focuses on what side-effects the client is going through when the intervention is implemented. As a reminder, the pharmacology piece of all of this really goes to how the medication is constructed, it goes to the use then of that medication and the side-effects of that medication which plays a heavy, heavy role, if I may use the word heavy, in how well our clients are compliant. Which means how well then can they address their ADLs on a regular basis. Which also means, how well or how great a quality of life they possess from the intervention. So, we begin to wonder in terms of what are we trying to address with the pharmacology that is associated with bi-polar depression. First, we are trying to correct that chemical imbalance. There are particular neurotransmitters that aid in our ability not to be depressed. Serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine, epinephrine, acetylcholine, all of those neurotransmitters play a role in our regulated system. And the first thing we look at from a pharmacological stand point is the issue of those chemicals. So we seek to have that in balance. One area of bi-polar depression not always given enough credibility is the concept of stress. And stress plays a role in the body's regulation and it impacts the amygdala in our body system and it impacts other areas of our brain. So, it's not just the chemicals in the brain, but it's the impact of stress on the brain that we have to look at with bi-polar depression. Trauma plays a role in regulating the system with regard to bi-polar depression and we have to look at particular trauma as well. So, the medications that we have really lend itself to aiding in that process. One of the medication that we use for bi-polar depression is lithium. Now lithium is a… is a kind of salt. There's a larger discussion we can have about lithium, but understand lithium to be one of the major medications used and it's a kind of salt. So it is in the classification of what we understand to be a mood stabilizer. In depression we talked about SSRIs and SNRIs and those kinds of things, and MAOIs. But we talk about mood stabilizers for bi-polar depression. Why? We want to cease that extreme mood swing that bi-polar clients tend to deal with. So, we use lithium. And what it tries to do is engage in what we call the sodium channeling signaling. Inside that process of neurotransmitters leaving one area, crossing a synapse and attaching themselves to another neuron, there's a mechanism within all of these receptors and sodium plays a role inside of these receptors. And what lithium does is go to that process and slow it down when it's in a manic phase. It doesn't want to stop it or inhibit it, it wants to slow it down. Other medications are used in combination with lithium to aid when we're in the depressive or the more extreme lows of bi-polar depression. They too are mood stabilizers. So, to assist with that drug lithium which is a mood stabilizer there are other drugs that aid for the extreme lows of bi-polar depression and they're also called mood stabilizers. But again their action is to assist when the patient or client is having the extreme low. And they're called drugs like Tegretol and Depakote. And what they're trying to do is address the lows that the client is going through inside of that synaptic transmission. And what they do is attach themselves to various channels as we call them, inside of those receptor sites that we all have in our brain. It is a complicated process, but to know that the medications get into the bloodstream and it's chemistry find his way to those particular receptor sites so that when neurotransmission is going on, the Tegretol and Depakote allows for the particular neurotransmitters to go across to synaptic cleft and attach and continue to messages down the line, where lithium is working inside the receptor sites to slow down the overflow of neurotransmitters that will if unaddressed will provoke the highs, so that the ultimate goal is that there's a balance regulated flow of neurotransmitters going from A to B in terms of the neurons. If that can be achieved, the client has a better chance to have a… a coping ability that's more adaptive in nature, so that they can address not only their quality of life issues whether, it's bathing or going to work or addressing family, but also gain insight into what's going on with them with regard to this particular bi-polar disorder. That's kind of what we're trying to do with the pharmacology of bipolar depression. One of the issues that we always talk about and I said a moment ago, addressing the pharmacology which is not only the chemistry of the drugs that we're talking about and the use of that particular drug like Tegretol is for bi-polar, as Paxil is for depression, we're also talking about side-effects. And here's where the overall treatment of pharmacology really rests. The mood stabilizers we talked about come with some significant side-effects. And it's those side-effects that… that cause issues in the way our clients take the medication. First and foremost, the workup period of these medications is not overnight. There usually is a 15 to 20 day window for symptoms that are active symptoms or positive symptoms mean the extreme highs, the negative symptoms are the extreme lows. For those symptoms to… to cease usually takes about a 15 to 20 day window. And over the course of that 15, 20 days you have client symptoms really can become worse. The suicide ideation can become worse. And those extreme highs and lows can be present and even more present. Second, suicide ideation can grow. So, our ability to monitor our clients in the workup phase is extremely important. Lithium levels can be checked through their medical doctor or any cross collaboration that we have as clinicians with the medical part of that working for us. But that means they must be taken regularly. These side effects beyond the symptoms not reducing themselves in initial workup phase also include extreme thirst. It includes tremors and it… it includes shakiness, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to heat, libido changes, you don't have the same energy you had when you take these medications and there is significant weight gain from these medications. All of those in a few more can add to… add to complications when working with this particular medication. All in all the jury is out on the exact pharmacological science on these mood stabilizers. But we do know that we need to reduce the chemical imbalance, we have to address the… the neurotransmitters that are in great supply on the one end of this disorder. And then when that those neurotransmitters are not in great supply how do we either inhibit or re-uptake action or aid them in using the neurotransmitters that are available. When we achieve that balance, we have the clients… the clients have an ability to address their daily issues which is what this is all about and live a sound quality life.
