DR. LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hi. I'm Lewis Schlosser I' m a professor of counseling psychology of Seton University. With me here… with me here today is Dr. Kathy Bieschke who is a professor of counseling phycology at Penn State University. One of Dr. Bieschke's major areas of interest is around LGB populations and heterosexual privilege. Dr. Bieschke, thank you so much for joining today to have a conversation about heterosexual privilege. 

00:00:55
KATHY BIESCHKE Okay. 

00:00:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER An… but I'm just gonna jump right in and… 

00:00:55
KATHY BIESCHKE Okay. 

00:00:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Um… and as we were talking about outside, I asked you the hardest question first right, which is like so what exactly is heterosexual privilege. 

00:01:05
KATHY BIESCHKE Well, totally based on Peggy McIntosh's definition of unearned benefits and so when I think about heterosexual privilege, I mostly think about it being the benefits I get on the basis of a status that I didn’t actually do anything to get, um… but sort of came into the world with. So it's the benefit I get from being heterosexual in this society, structural benefits, personal benefits. 

00:01:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Alright. And ah… as you know like um… one of the things I wanna share to is sort of help people understand sort of how to manifest in day-to-day life. So maybe you could talk about some examples to sort of bring into life. So how does… how does sexual privilege… how do we see it in everyday life you know? 

00:01:45
KATHY BIESCHKE Yeah. I think… well I think they are hard to see sometimes because it's part of the nature of it. So they are so part of the society that you don't really see them sometimes. But I think there are some really concrete um… examples. And I think one of the most concrete is just perhaps expression of sort of expression of how you feel about your partner in public and since that you didn't grab their hand, get them a kiss on the cheek as they drive off the work or drop the kids off and knowing that it’s… it’s… people expect that. They see that is normal. As soon as somebody does that who… to a same sex kind of a partner, then they have a lot of explaining to do or there are judgments made. Um… I think other benefits are things like financial ah… just in terms of being married and having an income tax return and getting a benefit for being married. That’s not just heterosexual privilege. I guess that's marriage privilege. Um… 

00:02:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER But since there is just like thing in our society where marriage has been limited to heterosexuals that now you are… 

00:02:45
KATHY BIESCHKE Exactly. 

00:02:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER You're limiting the privileges that go along with marriage. 

00:02:50
KATHY BIESCHKE Exactly. Two people who are married between a man and woman in most states… 

00:02:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. 

00:02:50
KATHY BIESCHKE …anyway. Um… I think it's also… I… you know I think when people hear that someone is gay and lesbian, um… often I've taught my students and friends that I've had said, immediately people are aware of who you are having sex with. Um… And when I… people don't think that about me. They assume then I am going… I'm… I'm with a man that’s not… that's not defining characteristic of being heterosexual. You don't label it as heterosexual. So when you're… when you come out as a gay or a lesbian or even a bisexual person where there’s a lot more complexities with the assumptions about that sexual orientation and I think those people automatically have to deal with those kinds of questions. I guess the last thing I want to say is I… I take my physical safety pretty much for granted um… as a heterosexual woman… 

00:03:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hmm… Hmm… 

00:03:40
KATHY BIESCHKE …with a… an opposite sex partner and I think that if you're um… a gay or a lesbian or… or a bisexual depending um… and how that’s manifesting, you know you… you put yourself at risks sometimes in the society and I don’t have to think about that. 

00:03:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And I was talking with well you earlier today and ah… for the video on male privilege and we talked about how men can walk down the street… 

00:04:00
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:04:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …really not concerned for your physical safety. So you might feel how concern if you are alone. 

00:04:05
KATHY BIESCHKE Exactly as a woman… 

00:04:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER But as a woman… 

00:04:05
KATHY BIESCHKE But with my husband… 

00:04:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. 

00:04:10
KATHY BIESCHKE …nobody would say oh, you're… you're with… what are you doing holding this person's hand… 

00:04:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. But if you're with a woman… 

00:04:15
KATHY BIESCHKE Hmm… Hmm… Right. 

00:04:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And they saw that you are like if you are walking, holding hands as a lesbian couple… 

00:04:15
KATHY BIESCHKE Clearly together as a couple. 

00:04:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Clearly, right. 

00:04:20
KATHY BIESCHKE Hmm… Hmm… 

00:04:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Then you start to think like well this is the safety issue. 

00:04:20
KATHY BIESCHKE Exactly. 

00:04:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER You know. 

00:04:25
KATHY BIESCHKE It could be a safety issue. 

00:04:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER It could be. Maybe in place where I live in New York City it might not be as you know… 

00:04:30
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. It really depends on where you live and what the culture is like there. 

00:04:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And there are some excellent examples. Ah… one of the sort of areas or sections that we have, if any of your questions I wanna talk with people, I know sort of the… the personal interest like so… like from where did you develop an interest in understanding heterosexual privilege? And I think this may be helpful for people who see the video to see how… how they can personally connect with… 

00:04:50
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:04:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …the material like how to make it… how to make it real and meaningful and not an academic exercise. 

00:05:00
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. So I would… you know I think over… it was probably over 25 years ago. And I mean one thing you have to keep in mind is the cohort effect with gay, lesbian, and bisexual issue. So 25 years ago, it was more complicated than it is today in terms of how open people were and I didn't know it, but I had a friend who is gay, who ultimately came out to me one of… I think I was one of the first or second people he came out to. And it was really eye-opening. You know I loved him as a human being. And the more I got to know him the more I realized how complicated it was to realize this about yourself and then have to struggle with telling your family, telling your friends, maybe not telling your professors, worrying about reactions, discrimination, safety. And you know as I knew him more and more, I realized well I don't have to worry about any of this. And that became the more… obviously the more you study the more you know, the more different people you know the more you realize just how built into society it is to be with someone of the opposite sex. How everything kind of was aligned that way and that I… I don’t have to struggle with those issues and people who are different than me have to struggle with them. So I think that’s how I really started. For me it was friend’s contact. 

00:06:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER With the contact. 

00:06:15
KATHY BIESCHKE Hmm… Hmm… 

00:06:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Were there other… I mean that's sort of something came over the other… 

00:06:20
KATHY BIESCHKE Yeah. 

00:06:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …points along the way that you might be able to… significant ones obviously there are many… 

00:06:20
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:06:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …little things that shape your journey and path but… 

00:06:25
KATHY BIESCHKE Hmm… Hmm… Well I think with every… with one contact comes more contact. So once you are seen as somebody who is… um… perhaps say for accepting somebody who is open, interested in learning, not perfect in terms of knowledge. Um… but then… then you become in more in contact with more people. One great example is some good friends of ours wanting to have children. A lesbian couple wanting to have children and the source of things they had to do in order to arrange the sperm donation, who should it be from, should it be anonymous. Um… it it's not anonymous, then there are some places that won't help you have a baby. And you know we didn't… we have two children. There was not an issue. I mean we didn't have to do anything. We didn't have to prove ourselves to anybody. Ah… So there was another um… we take it, we take procreation for granted. You know just listening to friends talk about um… health benefits. People who wouldn’t go to some states because they would be afraid not to able to visit their partners in the hospital they were in a fatal accident. Um… 

00:07:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Or wouldn't be trusted to make medical decisions if… 

00:07:35
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:07:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …their partner was incapacitated. 

00:07:35
KATHY BIESCHKE It would leave their children out of the room. They wouldn't bring in the children… you know it just seems crazy to me. So those kinds of stories in the newspaper, um… people I know all those things kind of reinforce for me just that I have this and I didn't do anything to really… I just was born in… for my… in my particular instance, I guess I was born and it's… it's what my heterosex… what my orientation is. 

00:08:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Yeah. One of the sort of follow-up questions is around like was there a moment at which you became aware of like the… so you're talking about sort of… if I understood you correctly, you're… you're sort of ally(ph) development process like how… 

00:08:10
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:08:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …you became… you understood like oh my God! my friend, all the… all the stuff he’s got to deal with… 

00:08:15
KATHY BIESCHKE Yeah. I don't have to do it. 

00:08:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …and I don't have to deal with it. Was that the moment you became aware of your heterosexual privilege? Or was it later like that we know that, no, no he has to deal with this stuff, but I don't. 

00:08:25
KATHY BIESCHKE I think… I think the part of this is that um… At first it was a person of connection, so I'll continue with the same (inaudible ) and then it was professional you know. I was asked to um.. help do edit some journ… journal. I did some research. It became something I want it to be equal, right, that I… I wanted to reduce the inequality, so there was a social justice motivation for me. Um… and in that process, ah… a lot of people assumed that I was a lesbian. Um… and that was really an interesting process. I used a lot of gay and lesbian examples in my classes. And I think to this day, there are a fair amount of people who assume that I am lesbian or if I'm not, out as a lesbian, I should be out as a lesbian. 

00:09:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Oh, your husband just doesn’t know. 

00:09:15
KATHY BIESCHKE And he just doesn't know or I'm denying it. And… and I had to really think about why am I so passionate about this issue, is that true. Um… You know it never even entered my mind to consider not being with someone of the opposite sex. And then as I began to realize it never entered into my mind, I… it did enter my mind. And then I had to think about why… why am I with a man. You know what is there, am I just doing this because society sort of puts this in place and um… sort of trains you from a young age to think about a certain way of living in the world and ah… I think as I began to explore where did my knowledge of my own sexual orientation came… where it came from, I began to think more about that it was… I got a lot of stuff out of being um… heterosexual. And if I had I'd been married 20 some years, if I had the choice and we… somehow we weren't together, would I be with a woman and what… what’s that about? Is that… it's always been an interesting process and it's more… it's sort of the professional and the personal and the introspection and all of that. 

00:10:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Well, it would be interesting if you're within a society where you were… if you somehow were able to 

00:10:20
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:10:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …control the society and you got to a certain point that when you became I guess your teenagers, you start to become interested in romantic relationships. 

00:10:30
KATHY BIESCHKE Exactly. 

00:10:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER People said okay, what do you like? 

00:10:30
KATHY BIESCHKE Who, who? Right, right. Which one. 

00:10:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And it would be like… 

00:10:35
KATHY BIESCHKE And then you raise your own kids and you… you have to think to yourself can I facilitate that in them. I'm… I'm assuming that they are going to partner with someone of the opposite sex um… or how do I make it possible for them to be whoever they wanna be and you… it's like fighting in an uphill battle. It's very tough. 

00:10:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Yes, some with my… we were with my daughter… both of our daughters, with my older daughter at a place and… at a wedding hall and she said something like oh, when I get married, I wanna get married here. My wife and I joked if you find a nice person to marry, we'll get… you can get married anywhere you want and someone at the hall said, will you find the nice man someday. 

00:11:10
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:11:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER It was… it was a very clear… 

00:11:10
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. We tried to use that general neutral language as well with our kids. 

00:11:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Find a nice person to… to spend their life with, but there was… you know you get a lot of societal messages that say something different like oh, she is a young… young lady, she will be with a man. 

00:11:25
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. Hmm… Hmm… 

00:11:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Um… So um… those are some of the pivotal points in your… 

00:11:30
KATHY BIESCHKE Hmm… Hmm… 

00:11:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …kind of in your development. And you alluded to something which I thought in my head should we get into this and I sort of feel like we should, which is like you said was I… was born that way. 

00:11:40
KATHY BIESCHKE Yeah, so I think we do need to get into that. 

00:11:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Like I feel like that's something it would be like… the whole like… don’t… don’t think about a wild elephant, you know and are you thinking about a wild elephant? Like what role do you think um… in terms of privilege, what role do you think this idea of some people thinking that as a choice, you know homosexuality as a choice… 

00:11:55
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:11:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …versus seeing it as something that well I was born being attracted to man.. 

00:12:00
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:12:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I was born being attracted to woman. 

00:12:05
KATHY BIESCHKE I… I mean I think that's a… I think that's a really great thing to think about and… um… I think a lot of people do think that it’s a choice that you um… choose a sexual orientation. If you're not choosing heterosexual, then you are choosing a sexual orientation. So you… sort of they think that somehow everyone is born one way. 

00:12:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Everyone's heterosexual, but you're choosing to be some. 

00:12:30
KATHY BIESCHKE Yes and you are choosing to be different. Um… And in a way that can be a pathway for people I think to become ally(ph) to… to really question whether or not ah… it's… it's… is it a choice and if it's not a choice, then it's biological and somehow that makes it okay, right? Um… That if you're born a certain way, then you can't do anything about it. But I think actually along the line of ally(ph) development, you might go from you're born in a certain way, you make a choice, then you realize no everyone's born who they are. They have a certain sex orientation and I actually think true affirmation is saying who cares if it’s a choice. Who… what's the difference? Um… so I think the path can be kind of complicated and I actually think it’s a little above. 

00:13:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Sort of a true affirmation means that role. 

00:13:10
KATHY BIESCHKE You should be… 

00:13:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I affirm you… I affirm you whoever you are regardless of how you got there. 

00:13:15
KATHY BIESCHKE Exactly, right. Like it doesn’t really matter if it’s a choice or not in the end, but… but it is interesting to know the research. It's interesting to think about the… that there are biological markers. It's interesting to interact with some people and realize there is just no way this person will ever be heterosexual ever and it's not about any amount of trying that they are going to do that there is perhaps some biological component that's you know manifesting in this way. So I believe in the biology, but I also think who cares and I think where this all falls apart is when you really start thinking about not falls apart, comes together is when you start thinking about bisexuality. 

00:13:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hmm… Hmm… 

00:13:55
KATHY BIESCHKE Um… So I think a lot of people might be able to reconcile in their heads that lesbian and gay people are born in a certain way. They are born, interested with affiliation for members of the same sex. Heterosexuals are born interested in people of the opposite sex. But bisexual individuals evidence interest in both. And then… then I think that's very hard sometimes for people to understand that that is… could also be the way someone is born. People tend to bifurcate sexual orientation instead of seeing it on a continuum, instead of seeing it as something that changes over time. Um… 

00:14:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. They bifurcate everything because it's easier for things to be… 

00:14:30
KATHY BIESCHKE Far easier. 

00:14:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …either or. 

00:14:30
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. It's either biological or it's not and I would say just it's a complicated interaction. 

00:14:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Same sex. You're… you're into same sex or into opposite sex, not both? 

00:14:40
KATHY BIESCHKE Not both. 

00:14:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER What do you people do in the middle there? 

00:14:40
KATHY BIESCHKE That's right. 

00:14:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER … in that grey area… 

00:14:40
KATHY BIESCHKE Hmm… Hmm… 

00:14:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER … I don't like to about. 

00:14:45
KATHY BIESCHKE Yeah. 

00:14:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Well, I think one of those sort of comments I have about when you say like well it doesn't matter, um… 

00:14:50
KATHY BIESCHKE Hmm… Hmm… 

00:14:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I think to be affirming it might not matter for you, but I wondered that the degree of (inaudible )matters to for example to get a… a conservative Christian or an orthodox or a… like a fundamentally, you know folks from there are more fundamentalists and conservative religious groups who will say… 

00:15:05
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:15:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …well, the… the… you know the (inaudible ) tax assets and the bombination. 

00:15:10
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:15:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER The… you know the argument to say I was born this way. If you are gonna say like we're gonna love all God's children, well God made me this way, so… 

00:15:20
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:15:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER … why don’t you love me? 

00:15:25
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. I think that a lot of really… really religious individuals do start to shift their views when they began to look at the um… research out there, the research on how conversion therapy is largely ineffective, often harmful that when they see people who work so hard to change and they can't and they begin to get to know people and realize that there's a biological component. And so then I think they are… they are the ones who initially move by thinking this is biological. But I have also seen some of those individuals sort of connect with the humanity of an individual and decide that what's most important is to figure out what's best for the client and it's irrelevant, but biology becomes just as irrelevant for me as it does for them. But… but it is a pathway I think out of thinking about privilege in a particular… I… I mean thinking about sexual orientation as a choice. 

00:16:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. 

00:16:15
KATHY BIESCHKE Hmm… Hmm… 

00:16:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. It’s a sort of I mean, it is this complicated issue because if… if you label it as a choice, then… then of course… 

00:16:20
KATHY BIESCHKE I know. 

00:16:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right, you know then… then we can help you choose something else. 

00:16:25
KATHY BIESCHKE Right exactly. 

00:16:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER As my… one of my good friends from many years ago said, yes of course I would choose to be discriminated against and of course I would choose to how people look at me funny when I… when I kiss my… 

00:16:40
KATHY BIESCHKE Hmm… Hmm… 

00:16:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …you know kiss my partner and I would choose not to have him with me in the hospital room when I need surgery. Of course I would choose this. 

00:16:45
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. Yeah, that’s a better way to be. Hmm… Hmm… 

00:16:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Um… Let's talk a little about um… if you would, how do you see other aspects of privilege sort of intersecting and we've already touched on I guess religion, because you talked more about that or other aspects of privilege intersecting with and you also even talked a little bit about umm... we talked a little about gender privilege too, but like how other aspects of privilege intersect with heterosexual privilege, either in additive ways or a intuitive ways in terms of how it impacts… 

00:17:15
KATHY BIESCHKE Hmm…hmm… 

00:17:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …once had our heterosexual privilege. 

00:17:15
KATHY BIESCHKE I think umm… I shouldn't think of my privilege as a tool I have to create change. So, when I look at my own, all the sources of my own privilege… I’m… and definitely white, which at this moment is a privileged status in the society um… I’m heterosexual, I’m well educated, um… and all of those things kind of work together to get me a certain amount of power, and I get to do what I want with that power and I think this is important… you know having all that privilege gives me certain ability to affect the structure of how we treat our students in our program. For example or umm… how we structure things that my university at Penn State umm… I think, you know if you… its hard to know with umm… for some people, I guess I’m accurate to what you’re asking, are asking it from the prospective of… of myself or from… from the other people who might have different intersecting privileges? 

00:18:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER You could really, I guess answered either way… 

00:18:15
KATHY BIESCHKE Hmm…hmm… 

00:18:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …like from a personal prospective or (inaudible ) the lines of other people like race or… 

00:18:20
KATHY BIESCHKE Yeah. 

00:18:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …or ability status or you know other aspects of privilege how they… when you have the multiple minority and/or majority status… 

00:18:25
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:18:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …is how that sort of interact with… with being heterosexual, having heterosexual privilege. 

00:18:30
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. I… I don’t be… I don’t really see it… it’s… it’s hard because people can kind of order their identities and what’s more… more important to them. 

00:18:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hmm… 

00:18:40
KATHY BIESCHKE Umm… And I… we haven’t really talked about this. I don’t… I don’t know if we can bring this into this, but it’s… 

00:18:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER You can bring anything and… 

00:18:50
KATHY BIESCHKE …that sort of sense that you can hide your privilege as a heterosexual and uh… or… or as a sexual… you can hide your identity as a sexual minority… 

00:19:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hmm…hmm… 

00:19:00
KATHY BIESCHKE …or as a heterosexual individual. And so, in a way, umm… if other issues are at stake, that could be something that you would chose not to umm… about yourself be vulnerable to and not having privilege or… or decide not to share with somebody. So, umm… 

00:19:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER No, I think it’s a really important point about the fact that like some certain privileges you would not… you cannot look at them… 

00:19:25
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:19:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …but to look at someone by themselves. 

00:19:25
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. And they think of ally’s(ph) and umm… sexual minorities having this in common that they have privilege, but they can keep it to them. They have… both have the secrecy and silence as part of their tools and their rapporteur. So, for example, if I’m in a situation and I… I’m not sure of my audience, I can decide how much of an ally(ph) I want to be in that moment. I… I don’t think I would. I don’t think, I met that point where I wouldn’t want anything to be said that I wouldn’t umm… counter in some way. But I might take my umm… ally(ph) and you and put it behind me, put my heterosexual privilege sort of out in the forefront, letting my politics in the background for a little bit. And I feel like that gives me a way to connect with people in other ways, they connect with me as a heterosexual or as woman or as a white person, and then when they find out later that I’m an ally(ph) umm… and I have a very different feel of sex orientation than… than they do it. It feels like I can create more personal change within that moment. 

00:20:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Because now you trust a person. 

00:20:25
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. Now, I’m just a person, so I can kind of put it aside, and then bring it up it… at in a moment that I think it might be… where it might have more power. Because sometimes people find out something about you and that’s the end of the conversation. Umm… So, it’s a privilege definitely, it buys me in with people and all the rest of my privileges buy me that same end. When you put ‘em all together and its quite a lot of power in the moment and no one would know at a playground umm… what my power checks are, about umm… gays and lesbians. Umm… but then they get to know me as a human being, and then they find out what I do, they find out what my researches, they can quite reconcile what I’m saying with what they see is a pretty standard umm… white middle-class married mother of two kids is like. 

00:21:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. I’m just hanging up raising my kids, doing my thing. 

00:21:20
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:21:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER But wait a minute, you… you think that… 

00:21:20
KATHY BIESCHKE You’re affirmative? 

00:21:20
LEWIS SCHLOSSER You’re affirm… but… but yeah you kind of… 

00:21:25
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:21:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER That’s when you start to buzzed with their brain a little bit. 

00:21:25
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. I think its complicated because silence… I’ve… I’ve written about this in another umm… in something I wrote earlier that it’s sort of a weapon in the heaven. Umm… So, in a way, it… you can use it to protect yourself, if you have to and I have, I mean, but it creates this sadness in me, when I do that. When I deliberately don't share what my research interests are umm… because I’m not sure of my audience umm… or for… for gay and lesbian people this is the thing we share is that people don't know who they really are. And certainly, that’s it for bisexual people. I think it’s weird for someone to come out as bisexual and there are a lot of… lot of social settings just because of the reaction that they might get. So, it’s a great thing to have, this is hidden kind of a tool, but it’s also… it can… it can be harmful. Umm… the other thing I think about it is that creates change when you say more. The more you can say, the more change can be created. 

00:22:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Well, it sounds like also with there’s a cause and we… I… 

00:22:25
KATHY BIESCHKE Yeah. 

00:22:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I’ve talk with this about other people about… about for example being Jewish and about the… 

00:22:30
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:22:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …costs of passing. So you know the cost of passing as an… as an ally(ph) is that let’s say… 

00:22:35
KATHY BIESCHKE Or it’s a non-ally(ph) 

00:22:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER let’s… as a non-ally(ph). Alright, let’s you are in a room and you’re not sure of the audience and you kind of you would… you do as you say like I’m… well, I’m should put yourself out there, but you put that ally(ph) how is that you hung put that in the back 

00:22:50
KATHY BIESCHKE Hmm…hmm… 

00:22:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Now, like the one or two LGB folk in the room might be like, you know… 

00:22:55
KATHY BIESCHKE With me in a category maybe two… 

00:22:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. They have… right. They’re like (inaudible ) right whereas, the other folks say well, I can talk to Kathy, I can relate to her, and then you might you know… that’s like one piece. And the other part I was wonder about is, have you ever countered then; if you have been silent at first, and then you can… you can connect, and then say, by the way you know somehow the ally(ph) status comes out. How that dynamic is? The whole… I mean I always would… watch powerful movies that we watch, which is probably from 80s or the 90s, which is on school ties with Brendon Fraser who was a Jewish guy at a private school and they all said, he lied to them because he… you know… 

00:23:30
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:23:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER He never said, he wasn't Jewish because they never asked. So, it’s a same kind of film. 

00:23:35
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:23:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So, if you don't… you just… you just advertise yourself a certain way, but then you sort of come and say, oh I’m an ally(ph). I wonder, have you gotten any sort of negative reaction at that point like, oh well…, but I… you know… you suckered me in kind of thing, like you… 

00:23:50
KATHY BIESCHKE Not too much. I think it’s because I would never act like a ally(ph). 

00:23:55
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Okay. 

00:23:55
KATHY BIESCHKE So you know, if it… if it came up in the moment, I… I would at… at… at the worst be neutral, umm… and mostly on the other side of saying, well everybody has a right to live how they want to live, a little more blend or little less umm… you know I do research on this and so I know and… 

00:24:10
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. 

00:24:10
KATHY BIESCHKE Umm… which I’m pretty humble about not knowing everything about sexual minorities. So, it hasn't… he hasn’t come back too much on me. Umm… and if that has, I may just not know about it. 

00:24:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I’m just more curious about… 

00:24:25
KATHY BIESCHKE Right, right. 

00:24:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …how that silence operates in that dynamic of… 

00:24:30
KATHY BIESCHKE I think it’s if you’re misleading people. 

00:24:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Umm… 

00:24:30
KATHY BIESCHKE I think then… I can do that because I happened to go to a, a very affirmative Christian church. Umm… it has Baptist in the title. And so, it really is easy to umm… really is easy to umm… and you can, in fact I hesitate even tell people I go to that church because I think then they can assumption umm… 

00:24:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER About the prisoners there. 

00:24:50
KATHY BIESCHKE They assume that they’re are more conservative they are. And so… 

00:24:50
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Oh because Baptist in the title. 

00:24:55
KATHY BIESCHKE Exactly. And so, umm… its… it’s almost hard to come out as a Christian umm… or someone who attends a Christian church because of the assumptions that they make. On the other hand, when people… they think they know something about me when they do hear I go to that church, they make the assumption that I’m not a ally(ph), umm… and then I get people talking to me in ways that I have to then correct their assumption. 

00:25:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER You mean, they’re thinking that you’re not ally(ph) because they make an assumption, because that name back is Baptist… 

00:25:15
KATHY BIESCHKE Exactly. 

00:25:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …is in the name of the church. 

00:25:15
KATHY BIESCHKE Exactly. Umm… 

00:25:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Because they don’t know to think about the actual… 

00:25:15
KATHY BIESCHKE The actual church. 

00:25:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …about… about what the church is… 

00:25:25
KATHY BIESCHKE They just think they know about to start the same and Baptists aren’t affirmative, which isn’t true either, by the way. 

00:25:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Right. But if you belong to an affirmative church and they don’t know about that they hear Baptist they think or were the Baptist are in the front. 

00:25:35
KATHY BIESCHKE Yes, exactly. 

00:25:35
LEWIS SCHLOSSER So, umm… One of things that I… I would like you to talk about a little bit for a such switch gears would be like um… what can… what can heteros… what… I guess what can we do as trainers to help people sort of acknowledge their heterosexual privilege sort of you know consciousness and… consciousness is raising becoming more aware, and of course, being sort of empathetically understanding of the experience of LGB folk. 

00:26:00
KATHY BIESCHKE This is my favorite topic. Umm… I… I really feel like what the field needs to do is stop… umm… I think sometimes we do our students to do service and we were so affirmative and I think programs need to be affirmative. Umm… but we’re so affirmative that we get people saying what we want them to say, and not really looking at umm… how they know they’re heterosexual, what their assumptions are about gay and lesbians? Umm… There’s so eager to please, they’re so fearful of evaluation that I think they shut… they can shut down. And the whole… the way to really reduce your heterosexual privilege is to examine it, and realize when you are in situations where it might be hard not exercise that privilege or when you realize that you’ve assumptions that aren't accurate. So, we want it and we should create umm… environments where people can really put themselves on the table and look at these things. I’ve said, humiliating things to gay and lesbian friends about my assumptions umm… that have just transformed how I think about the population. I think our students should able to say that to the faculty. 

00:27:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hmm…hmm… 

00:27:05
KATHY BIESCHKE And we should allow… allow for a lot of digging around. Umm… You know I don't think that we do that and some of it is awareness, some of it is knowledge, really understanding. I’m finding out what that… but we think the truth is and a lot of it is contact, umm… exposure to human beings who are lesbian, gay and bisexual exposure, to movies exposure, materials umm… to faculty umm… that’s another way, that there is just no way you can hold on to all of the assumptions someone might have or all of your assumptions about what it means to gay and lesbian when you are a real life human being that you are at. 

00:27:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER And it takes the whole prejudice often based on a conceptual idea of something as opposed to actual experience with or if it is actual experience, it might be very limited. 

00:27:55
KATHY BIESCHKE And I think we have to be more sensitive to people who are religious and understand that umm… they’re really struggling, not so much with giving up there privilege, but more so with a shift in your world view that’s going to alter the rest of their lives; umm… and its hard… it’s hard for them and we… I think if we can give them support and some empathy for this process that will make… will make more inroads in the long run than by just saying, we have to be in a certain way that’s what a psychologist is. 

00:28:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER I mean, what are your thoughts on… I mean since it’s time, if the tossing of that student from the progress, if you’re aware. 

00:28:30
KATHY BIESCHKE Yes. Oh, yes. 

00:28:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER The student and I think it’s injured some other… there’s a student who was dismissed from the program because she uh… wouldn’t follow remediation plan and umm… 

00:28:40
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. 

00:28:40
LEWIS SCHLOSSER …because she said, well she… her believes on homosexuality were based on her Christian faith that she believe that was a sin and… 

00:28:45
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. I… I don't know… not about that particular case, but in umm… in general, I don't think you can tell people that they have to believe in a certain way. Umm… But I think you can as training program expect that everyone who comes in your pro… training program would be able to competently work with anyone who comes through the door. Uh… So, for me, they probably need some minimum level of affirmation, some ability could… to connect with the client as a human being umm… not just see them as evil, for example I don’t think it would be useful to set in a session and find out someone is gay and you know to have to grip the chair in order to go through the session. I think some people are… have that… that’s the extent to which they have this, these really negative beliefs, so that’s not okay. So, people have to work to get to a place where they can connect with someone, form an alliance endue perhaps, inappropriate referral because I think competent depends on what the issue is, what the situation is umm… and I think that people who are really religious, who don’t… who even who think of being umm… gay or lesbian and bisexual might be a sin could still work effectively with the gay and lesbian climax scene that happen and I think that should be there expectation. So, you just can’t say, I’m not gonna to do it umm…, but if you’re remediating someone because they don’t believe it in a certain way. I… I don’t if that you can… I don’t know that I agree with that either. 

00:30:15
LEWIS SCHLOSSER You’d rather say, well let’s figure out how you can competently work with these clients. 

00:30:20
KATHY BIESCHKE Right, with gay and lesbian, bisexual clients any client. There are lots of clients that are gonna push your buttons and you are gonna have to figure out how to connect with them and do competent work. 

00:30:30
LEWIS SCHLOSSER What are umm… what are sort of you know when people watch videos, they… sometimes they… they might zone-out(ph), they may… you know they… they don’t remember everything. 

00:30:40
KATHY BIESCHKE Oh no! 

00:30:45
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Never. Or it would be like one or two sort of take home things you would want people who watch those video does sort of like you know, they don’t remember much from a conversation like what should they remember that about heterosexual privilege, you know… 

00:30:55
KATHY BIESCHKE Right. I… I think that… I think even though I had been thinking about this for about 25 years, everyday I have a new insight about what it means to a heterosexual and sort of the benefits I had from that. And I think we… I think we… can be kind of harden myself about that like, I can’t believe you’re still doing this Kathy, How can you not know this, you thought about this for 25 years. But I realized that its not so much the outcome, uh… it’s the process and the process is stay and engaged and being vigilant and thinking about umm… the ways in which I benefit at other peoples expense. Its very hard for me to hang on to it, it helps keep me engaged in the process. And then, there’s second thing I think I would say is that it motivates me, it motivates me to be an ally(ph), but it motivates me to be an advocate, it motivates me to think about umm… issues from an entirely different perspective that I as a heterosexual, I’m not gonna to loose anything by giving people more privilege umm…, but that actually society gains… 

00:32:00
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Hmm…hmm… 

00:32:00
KATHY BIESCHKE …if everybody has equal kind of excess to the same benefits. 

00:32:05
LEWIS SCHLOSSER That’s great. Was there anything that you wanted me to ask you or wanted to talk about that we didn’t get to? Something like I wanna make sure we mention… you know we get to this, was there something that we didn’t cover? 

00:32:15
KATHY BIESCHKE Hmm…hmm… Uh… There was something, but I can’t actually think of it right now. 

00:32:25
LEWIS SCHLOSSER Things happen. Well, I really… well, it doesn’t… it’s not in the comes to mind, I wanna thank you… 

00:32:30
