Expressive arts therapy films and resources Media Inc. INTRODUCTION “Children & the Arts” Added Features Judith A. Rubin, Ph.D., ATR-BC 

00:00:10
JUDITH A. RUBIN My name is Judy Rubin. I’m an art therapist and analyst, a psychologist and I was an art teacher. I also taught courses in art and education at a local school, Point Park College where they were training teachers and early childhood and elementary education. In one-year, Point Park got a grant from Model Cities, which was why kids start part of (inaudible ) poverty and their grant was to do an arts program, a creative arts program in the summer. I was the director of the program. And I enjoyed that because I was able to select people to work in the program who I felt that had not only creative skills and the ability to work with children in art and drama and movement and music, but they were also highly sensitive individuals. Some of them were artists, some of them were teachers, some of them were arts therapists. They were a very gifted bunch. There were two neighborhoods. In one neighborhood, you will see in the film, all the kids were black because it was an all African-American neighborhood. It was in what's called the Hill District, the same place that August Wilson’s place come from. The other program happened in a place called South Oakland, which was a very mixed community, low enough on the socioeconomic skill to qualify for Model Cities funds. But what was fascinating was that the program in each center took on a character of its own based on the community, but also on the staff and their interaction with the children and it was wonderful. And in each place, they had different ways of connecting with the community. In one, there was a performance and you will see some excerpts from the performance. In the other, they invited parents and for an open house where they participated with the children. I was excited by what was happening here and I thought this is wonderful work that’s going on. If only we could get some money to do some filming, we could use this as a way of teaching people, ways of working with children in the arts and how the arts are helpful to children. So fortunately, Model Cities which had funded the programs, also was willing to fund film making. And so we hired some photographers who came and filmed. We also used Super-8 footage that I and others had… had shot, as well as slides and we put together a film…

CHILDREN AND THE ARTS A FILM ABOUT GROWING 

00:02:55
JUDITH A. RUBIN …about children and the arts, which I subtitled a film about growing because I think it does have to do with how the arts help children to grow. In the film, I tried to show some of the ways in which the arts are especially helpful in dealing with emotional issues, but also the ways in which adults can interact with children to allow them to find themselves more fully to the creative process and showing instances of beautiful work between adults and children in this process as a way hopefully of inspiring others, giving good models, a practice and it was not addressed specifically to therapists, although the emphasis is strongly on the therapeutic aspects, but rather it was addressed to everyone who works with children especially people who are interested in their emotional development. The program continued for another year. We did some more filming in another location and then put the film together. Now the music was fun too because there was a guy who ran the program at the Ozanam Center who was also a professor of philosophy at a local college, but he was a musician as well. He was a drummer. And he put together a group that watched the film and improvise to the rhythm of the film. And in addition to the children and the arts, we have some special features on this DVD. One of them is called glass art as therapy and it’s the story of some work by a glass artist with some children in Guatemala orphans who were in a residential institution where he set up a glass studio and taught the kids how to do glasswork and they ended up not only making beautiful things, which they were to sell, but also improving in many areas of their lives because it was a master's thesis project and there were some tests before and after. The intervention, which demonstrated the amount of growth, James Minson is the person who gave us permission to use and excerpt from his film and we thank him very much. The other short piece that’s on this DVD is from the multi-arts resource guide and that was actually made by a friend of mine, Maida Abrams who was the director of very special arts in Massachusetts for teachers about all of the arts and activities that they could do with the children in their classrooms, to help them to feel better about themselves as well as to learn skills. And so you will see some excerpts from their guide, which is actually two videos and a written manual. So we thank them very much for permission and we hope you enjoy that as well as children in the arts, the main film on this DVD about the Model Cities arts program.

Expressive arts therapy films and resources Media Inc. CHILDREN AND THE ARTS A FILM ABOUT GROWING 

00:07:05
Children and the arts go together because the arts are a way of taking what comes naturally to children and giving it form. We all know that kids like to move, that they like to move fast and they like to move slow, even in slow motion. 

00:07:35
[sil.] 

00:07:40
And when that movement has some form, people call it dance. We know too that they like make noise and when that noise has rhythm and melody, that’s called music. And of course, they like to make marks with crayon, with paint. They like to build and to construct, to put things together. And when they do that with certain materials, that’s called art. Sometimes, the art turns in to make believe, the clay sculpture becomes a hat and that’s drama. 

00:08:35
[sil.] 

00:08:50
This drama is about rescuing a drowning sailor. 

00:08:55
[sil.] 

00:09:05
And this one is about an old lady goes down to the kitchen to get breakfast for the old man. She opens first one cupboard then another, find the jar and breaks it and the old man is very-very angry. 

00:09:25
[sil.] 

00:09:35
Children like to try on many different roles like being a preacher in a church meeting. 

00:09:45
[sil.] 

00:10:00
Or maybe testifying. 

00:10:05
[sil.] 

00:10:15
And that same boy can explore his identity in yet another way through color and line because children think a lot about the sort of roles they’d like to have in the future about who and what they want to become. 

00:10:30
I wanna be a mechanic when I grow up 

00:10:35
I wanna work on airplanes 

00:10:40
I wanna teach people how to work on cars and planes and boats and tanks 

00:10:45
I know what I wanna be I wanna be a pilot 

00:10:45
I know what I wanna I want to be a school teacher 

00:10:50
I wanna be a policeman 

00:10:50
Okay… ‘Bye 

00:10:55
They can learn from each other too. Sometimes they learn by watching or by doing something together, maybe it’s just one friend or maybe it’s a whole group. It takes a lot of people to lift somebody up. 

00:11:20
[sil.] 

00:11:25
They learn a lot from grownups too and grownups who give the materials and who show them what to do and how to do things. Especially grownups who themselves have an identity in an art form and who want not only to teach it, but to share it as well. Work could be just as exciting to learn to enjoy the arts as it is to be a participant. It’s fun to watch their mind and try to figure out what’s happening. 

00:12:05
[sil.] 

00:12:25
It’s fun to listen and to sing along when somebody plays for you and somebody else sings along too. 

00:12:40
[sil.] 

00:12:45
And it’s fun to dance when someone’s leading you. And there’s hardly anything which is much fun as having your own special grownup partner. 

00:13:00
[sil.] 

00:13:10
And it’s awfully important that the grownup who chooses to work with children should understand that they don’t always feel strong and brave and they sometimes feel scared of things like snakes and monsters. 

00:13:30
Snakes can bite you. Snakes bite you sometimes Ow! It bit me ‘m gonna eat the snake Ooh! I’m gonna eat it I’m gonna eat the snake all up! 

00:13:40
And then same children who get scared and silent can also begin(ph) and can be so full of life and energy that even though they walk, they just can’t keep from wiggling. 

00:13:55
[sil.] 

00:14:00
All they need is some space and some music and they will dance. 

00:14:05
[sil.] 

00:14:10
All they need is a surface and something to draw with and they all make a mark. Different people like different kinds of materials. But the very best kinds are the ones that allow you to give them their own unique form, to give them your own individual structure like clay, which can become flat, mask-like face for this little boy or can be squeezed and pinched and manipulated and explored in all of its tactile properties by this little girl. And yet another person might decide to do something different to make something real like an animal with four legs. In the same way, a scarf can be something to move with or to pat a baby lion with or if you are the lion tamer, the same scarf can become a whip to chase those angry lions. Even to the same music, each person can make up his or her own step. 

00:15:45
[sil.] 

00:15:50
You can become yourself even when you’re a part of a group. Look at the girl in the center. 

00:16:00
[sil.] 

00:16:05
Now your bag might be writing poetry or playing the piano or maybe an instrument like the recorder. Given a wide choice of materials, children can explore and can discover their own special likes and talents. But whatever they are, it always takes time and effort and practice to get to know the toes of the trade and the skills that make them work for you. And then it pays off and you feel good and proud and you wanna share things with other people. You wanna show them what you’ve done, wrap it up, put it on display, making something all by yourself can make you feel strong and powerful as a rocket. It’s especially important for people, especially little people to feel sometimes as if they can do things, as if what they do has an impact on their world. Maybe it’s a make-believe scene where you are the strong one and your daughter is the weak one. And maybe it’s other children and you’re being magic and putting them to sleep. 

00:17:35
[sil.] 

00:17:40
Just like it takes practice to learn a sport, it takes lots of practice and even some help from a teacher to become aware of all the different parts of your body to be able to move them when you want to and how you want to, to learn the kind of control that makes a person able to dance. 

00:18:05
[sil.] 

00:19:00
Now if it’s hard to learn to control your body all by yourself, it’s even harder to learn to get it to move to the music and especially hard to do that when you’re part of the group. To stay with others, to stop and to start together and to move together means becoming sensitive to those other people, watching them carefully at the same time that you are listening to the beat. 

00:19:30
[sil.] 

00:19:50
And another kind of control and awareness, your movements can tell a story like these girls who are mixing grain and pounding it or these boys who are thrashing the wheat. 

00:20:05
[sil.] 

00:20:10
It’s especially fun to make believe that you are somebody or something else like a snake that crawls or a bunny rabbit that hops or a tiger that roars. It may help to have a costume that tells other people who and what you’re supposed to be. Sometimes a mask can help too especially if you made it yourself. Of course it’s fun to finger-paint with your mask on your head, but it’s even more fun to put it on your face and fool your baby brother and it’s especially fun to fool a grownup, particularly that grownup has to lift it up to find out who is underneath. Children masks have lots of feelings in them because children have lots of feelings in them. Sometimes those feelings are kind of messy and yucky. And sometimes they are a little bit scary. One of the most helpful things about the arts is that they give children ways of exploring and expressing and articulating those scary feelings. You might wanna mess with your brother, but it’s better if you mess with the fingerpaint and you might feel like pounding your sister, but it’s a lot safer to pound a drum. The angry feelings can go into a story too like this drama about the robbers. The killing is make believe and that makes it safe. The punch that can hurt can become a dance, it can become so highly stylized and ritualize that it becomes a thing of beauty. 

00:22:35
[sil.] 

00:22:45
And so those scary, angry, messy feelings can be turned through the arts and do something lovely. Now the same fellow who has two puppets so angry at each other, can also have two puppets who feel very loving toward each other because children have all sorts of feelings inside them. One of the nicest things that happens when people work side by side together in the yards is that they learn to know and to respect one another. Mothers and children, children and children, it’s good to have somebody there to show your picture too when you’re finished. People share materials and space. People help each other. 

00:23:50
[sil.] 

00:24:00
People show things, they tell things and the grownup (inaudible ) the instrument with the child or holds it on his knee is a same grownup who teaches the skills the child needs to be able to play it. 

00:24:20
[sil.] 

00:24:25
The best help perhaps(ph) someone show you how it works so that you can do it yourself. Some things are too big for one person to make like a mural but a group can make a beautiful backdrop, you can make a picture together and you can make music together. Sometimes, it just happens spontaneously like this trio. And if you put enough people and enough instruments together, you got a rhythm then. And the band makes a kind of music that no one musician can make by himself. There is a lot of things going on between people when they work and play and learn together. And one of the things that happens is that they begin to care about each other and the child who begins to feel good because he knows how to do something, feels even better because he’s found some grownup who believes in his ability and who believes in him as a person, who shows him that he likes him just the way he is. A grownup who can get on the floor and be a snake with you, is a very nice sort of grownup to know. It makes being in the jungle even more fun. 

00:26:05
[sil.] 

00:26:10
It takes a great deal of trust on the part of both the adult and the children to engage in the creation of a multimedia body painting. And that good happy feeling is the feeling the children can get from the arts, from finding out what they can do and learning how to do it, feeling strong and proud and really good about themselves, and in the process grown.

JAMES MINSON I’m James Minson, a glass artist here in Seattle and I’m also a student at Antioch University where I’m studying psychology and art therapy. 

00:28:30
JAMES MINSON I began working in glass when I was 14. I first came to Seattle the world capital of contemporary glass art in 1989 to work at the Pilchuck Glass School where I met Elsara Sturies(ph) a Guatemalan student who came to study glass in the summer of 2001. Elsa was keen to start a glass studio in Guatemala and invited me to visit. According to the Central Intelligence Agency, 75 percent of the population live below the poverty line. Elsa and I stopped to visit her friend (inaudible ) who runs a Misioneros Del Camino home for orphaned, abandoned and malnourished children. This is home to around 50 children ranging from babies to young adults. The home also incorporates a school serving its residents and a local community. There was an empty room in the school that was perfect for a glass studio and with assistance from Elsa I put a plan in motion to open a glass studio there. Federico Carranza was a marvelous help in setting out and continues to monitor the studio. Everyone later in the studio came together with hardly a problem. The studio began with the demonstration of the basics, Spanish translation was provided by Elsa. 

00:29:45
[sil.] 

00:29:50
JAMES MINSON After the demonstration we lit up the fires and everyone started melting glass. The group are very focused and dedicated. The studio has custom-made ceramic top tables, a concrete floor, plenty of natural light and ventilation. As well as teaching techniques, I provided sketch books and pencils for the students to take notes and draw their ideas. Right from the start, the studio had a sense of community with everyone sharing ideas and helping each other. 

00:30:20
[sil.] 

00:30:30
JAMES MINSON The idea was that the original students would teach new members and the studio would become self-sufficient and self-perpetuating. The students began making small items such as birds, animals and angels to sell in Guatemala and aboard.

00:31:40
JAMES MINSON During the first year of the project, I visited every three months to teach and keep an eye on progress. Elsa and Federico supervised the studio on a weekly basis. Since I was studying psychology and art therapy, I asked to the group if they would participate in a research study and they agreed. Using assessments and questionnaires, I would attempt to prove that teaching a group craft skill would also improve their overall life skills. These images taken around six months into the project, show dedication and potential. These images taken in the second year of the project show a level of confidence and skill. The group are producing marketable products and had organized a business with the board of directors. The research project conducted over the period of two years resulted in consistent scores on the Ansell-Casey Life Skill Assessment in the categories of daily living tasks, money management, self-care and social development. Scores on the work and study habits category were up over 22%. The results in the eight-part questionnaire administered pre and post study were also consistent in the categories of the importance of the home, school, church, biological family, foster family, art, the glass studio and life away from home. The conclusion from this data is that teaching a group craft skills also elevated their overall working study habits. 

00:33:15

00:33:25
JAMES MINSON As there are new babies and children coming into the home all the time, there is no limit to a project such as this.

00:33:50
What your goal is here is to work with the children in creative ways, encourage them to develop their imaginations, to develop their fine and gross motor skills and to make some decisions about how they want something to look. This can be really hard when you’re teaching to not make the decisions for the children and to give them a chance to play with materials. A lot of times we make the decisions for them and decide that something isn’t appropriate or they can’t do it and sometimes they surprise us. 

00:34:20
This is great… 

00:34:25
[sil.] 

00:34:25
We’re looking for the process that is where all of the creativity occurs. It’s not so much that we come up with a finished product that was polished but that we, we learn the steps along the way. 

00:34:50
It’s my belief that most children have extraordinary imaginations. Wake up and become your animal and move through the jungle. 

00:35:05
[sil.] 

00:35:10
But you’re a little bit scared now. You’re a little bit scared, you’re walking into the house very-very carefully because you think it might be haunted house. 

00:35:25
So making up something in the movement is an improvisation. You now have a chance to incorporate all the elements of movement in an improvisation. 

00:35:35
…by being back to back, you might wanna connect by your legs, but you’re going to create an imaginary creature with your partner but your partner and you have to decide do you wanna have a creature that has very tight movements or very loose movements. 

00:36:00
[sil.] 

00:36:05
Me and the Monster 

00:36:05
MAIDA ABRAMS In the first lesson, you do both your monster side and your… your real side. Here you actually lay down on a piece of paper and trace yourself with two heads. One of the things that’s a lot of fun about this is that you can trace these at your leisure and then let the kids work on them, at different times of the day, you can unroll the self-portraits. It’s really helpful if you start with a real side first and let them get creative with the monster side later. We’re gonna be using markers and crayons and you use big crayons and we color big areas, we can use contact paper and sticky dots. When do we use the sticky stuff? 

00:36:40
After we do… 

00:36:45
MAIDA ABRAMS After we get all the coloring, great. You can give yourself ten eyes and Kelly over here has already started, she’s got one, two, three, four, six eyes, no seven, sorry one on top of your head too. That one sees everything. So you can make your monster self. Now is this… Do we really have a monster inside of us? 

00:37:05
Yes. 

00:37:05
MAIDA ABRAMS Well, physically is there a monster inside? When you get angry, there is monster inside you. I don’t think there is really a monster living inside my body. 

00:37:15
Maybe don’t be afraid, I’ll be back. 

00:37:20
MAIDA ABRAMS You will be back. We could give ourselves eight eyes, antennas, claws, arms, legs, even wings if we want it. And this is our chance to draw that other half. It becomes a real mixed media portrait and you can really use what ever you want. There are so many different materials available. Is everybody here the same color? 

00:37:45
No. 

00:37:45
MAIDA ABRAMS No, all sort of different. What do I have more of in my skin? 

00:37:50
Pink. 

00:37:50
MAIDA ABRAMS More pink. What does John have more of? 

00:37:50
Brown. 

00:37:55
MAIDA ABRAMS Yeah. What does Antonio have? 

00:37:55
Yellow. 

00:37:55
MAIDA ABRAMS Little bit more yellow. What do you have? 

00:38:00
Pink. 

00:38:00
MAIDA ABRAMS Yeah. And what do you have over there Sara? A little bit more white. Now we’re gonna mix these skin colors, we’re gonna use the primary colors red, yellow, blue and white. If I have to mix your color Antonio, what colors would I need to start with? 

00:38:15
ANTONIO White. 

00:38:15
MAIDA ABRAMS White. What else? 

00:38:20
ANTONIO Yellow. 

00:38:20
MAIDA ABRAMS Yeah. That’s gonna make light yellow. So what else do I need? 

00:38:25
ANTONIO I have no idea. 

00:38:25
MAIDA ABRAMS Yeah. Do I need any blue? 

00:38:25
No. 

00:38:30
MAIDA ABRAMS Well let’s find out what’s gonna happen. what do you think Antonio? Do you need some blue? Are you pink? I think we’re gonna need to add a drop of blue to it because you know what the basic colors you start with are red, yellow and blue. But you’re not purple either, so we’re gonna have to do some adjusting here. Add a little bit of yellow. What do you think? More white, okay. 

00:39:00
[sil.] 

00:39:05
MAIDA ABRAMS Does that look good? Okay, that’s good. Let’s see what it looks like. Put your hand in it, then when you go to stamping on the paper just press down, go ahead. Get most of that paint off, go ahead. Good, excellent, great. Now we’re gonna do Kelly’s. Now what does Kelly need to add? 

00:39:30
More white. 

00:39:30
MAIDA ABRAMS More white. What else? Anybody else have any suggestions. 

00:39:35
Yellow. 

00:39:40
I think more yellow. 

00:39:40
MAIDA ABRAMS You think more yellow? What do you think? 

00:39:45
I think a little bit of more white. 

00:39:45
MAIDA ABRAMS Okay, Antonio what do you think? 

00:39:45
I think yellow. 

00:39:50
MAIDA ABRAMS You think yellow. You have any ideas Jimmy here, what do you think? 

00:39:55
White. 

00:39:55
MAIDA ABRAMS Does that look right? 

00:40:00
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:40:00
MAIDA ABRAMS Okay. So get your hand right in. Yeah nasty, it’s okay. And put your hand right next to it. Awesome. Now one thing I want you to notice is that everybody is a little bit different. Good. Pick your hands up you guys.

Expressive arts therapy films and resources Media Inc. Pittsburgh Child Guidance Center and Western Psychiatric Institute & Clinic present THE GREEN CREATURE WITHIN… ART AND DRAMA IN GROUP PSYCHOTHERAPY 

00:44:25
[sil.] 

00:44:30
Two hours a week for two years, a group of adolescents came to the outpatient clinic of Pittsburgh Child Guidance Centre to be part of an expressive therapy group. Each had a different problem, each had a different label, but all were herding. To meet their different needs, we made available a wide range of flexible materials, which could be used in a variety of ways. We hoped that through the use of many different creative modalities, these adolescents might come to find, to know and to master what one member called that Green Creature Within. The expressive media made available included art, drama, poetry, music and dance, as well as photography. Super-8 movies and slides taken by the group members themselves were used to help these adolescents look at what was going on and to develop not just artistic but psychic perspective. 

00:45:35
Take it easy… Take it easy… Don’t let the sound on your own wheels drive you crazy. We may lose and we may win though we will never be here again So open up…

Talking directly about sensitive issues was often painful. For some like Matthew it was easier to say things through poetry or in writing. Some of the art work was almost painfully eloquent such as Cindy’s two agonized faces made after witnessing in especially traumatic event. Marlene herself an abandoned child had recently had an abortion. For months she created, nursed and destroyed a series of symbolic babies only then could she talk openly about the experience into her own feelings of loss. A leader in a group of this kind must be flexible enough to play many different roles, most of the time observing, listening and responding empathically.

There are times however but it may be in teaching skills or helping a group member with a task like helping Sherry make her paper mache sculpture. There were leaders who were willing to look, listen, play, teach, take roles and to help in any way that might be needed. And most of all, there was a sense of fun, of joy, of playfulness, which made it possible for members to react to each other in a natural way. There was a feeling of community in which the group members learned from each other…

As the family selects puppets, the therapist observes their individual behaviors and their interaction. Some puppets are chosen immediately, others are rejected or avoided. The selection process provides the therapist with important clues about the dynamics of the family. The particular meaning that the puppet has for the person usually becomes clear through the interaction and conflict portrayed within the story, as well as during the discussion after the story when each person is asked to think about which puppets they chose and why. 

00:48:30
ELLIE IRWIN How about introducing your puppets to everybody, so all the puppets can have a chance to meet each other? 

00:48:35
Okay. 

00:48:35
Dad has to go first. 

00:48:40
RON My name is Ron. Good to see you. And this is duck, okay. 

00:48:45
ELLIE IRWIN I would like you to take a couple of minutes and to try to think together of a way you could start a story using some of the puppets that you’ve got. 

00:48:55
Absorbing the formation of the story, it is often possible to determine family roles. Most families works best when hidden behind a puppet stage, which provides psychic, as well as aesthetic distance. 

00:49:10
RON Okay. And all these creatures… 

00:49:15
Shut up. 

00:49:15

00:49:50
Okay, sing a song. If we all came back together, we brought everything back with us.

When the story stops, the therapist can continue the interaction by talking directly to the puppets. 

00:50:05
ELLIE IRWIN If you could show your story to an audience on television for example, what could we tell them would be the moral of the story?

We really didn’t know what was gonna happen. When we started we were told that the children had all kinds of problems, things that would make it hard for them to do what we expected them to do. We wanted to see what children like these could do when given art materials and offered freedom. And these weren’t just ordinary children. They were the kind of children that are called special or exceptional, which is a plight way of saying that they had a lot of things wrong with them, they had labels like mentally retarded, brain damaged, cerebral palsied and the one label that all of them shared no matter their other disability was that they were blind.

And then there was David who zoomed around the paper with marker, with brush who took all the energy he used to use to bite and pinch and kick and put it into his paintbrush and put it into his pictures.

DARCY LYNN Artist The first time I wanted to draw was in intensive care it would be when I was feeling more conscious and because I was sedated with a lot of stuff and I think it was more of the concern to see if I still had it in me and I could still do it, I could still do that drawing line that hadn’t been taken away. I think my heart really helped me because it was the only way I could hold on to my own identity and I think if I didn’t have that it would have been awfully difficult. To be treated for cancer is a long process and you need something, you need something to hold on to, that’s you. 

00:55:45
In work, which is true to both art and therapy, people are helped to find, to know and to accept the true self which may be hidden within behind the masks they wear. 

00:56:00
They let you let out like that we let out like where I was mad at and stuff like that. 

00:56:10

At the western Pennsylvania school for blind children Jim Gardner and Roni Ostfield work with blind and partially-sighted children in a creative dramatics program. Spontaneous play can help to organize and make sense of the outer world as well as the inner world of feeling. At times improvisations are humorous that may also reflect underlying worries as in this unplanned drama.

In the drama, feelings and fantasies are expressed and accepted as therapist and child work towards clarification, control and change. Puppet play and improvisation can be valuable diagnostic, as well as therapeutic tools for children in their families.

Playing, creating it’s as naturalist can be. Now kids often play out things they are wondering about. It’s their way of trying to understand what has happened or what could happen. Like doctor play, most kids have been poked and locked down and examined and maybe even hurt by the doctor. So it feels good to turn it around and be the doctor and do all those things to someone else, being active instead of passive. Creating from past experiences and feelings, they project part of themselves into what they make. 

01:02:25

Sometimes, it’s even easier to talk about feelings with puppets like feelings of affection as Shirley and Fay are doing. Kids have a lot of stories to play out too. Sometimes their funny stories like when Dana pretended to be a statue for sale in the store and Ralph began to argue about the price. Well, it was so funny that even Dana had a hard time to keep from laughing. 

01:03:10
348 dollars. It should be 348 dollars.

01:03:50
Now playing out dreams can be scary, but if kids talk about it when it’s over, it helps to know that other people have scary dreams too. And the dreams aren’t for real but they come from feelings inside and that it helps to talk about it.

Of course, it takes a special kind of grownup to play with kids this way. A grownup who can really listen, a grownup who remembers what it’s like to be young to have all those thoughts and ideas and feelings and stories inside, just waiting for a time and the place to be expressed.

And also the sense of control that you have over your life and you are very confused and it… it also leads to a lot of depression, but art, if they begin to explore and work in art, I think they can get that feeling of control back of having choices, their infinite choices in art and their dependency becomes less as they explore and create themselves.

These four-year old children are choosing parts of themselves that they want to explore by beginning with an experience with each part. One at a time, they are gradually moving into a richer consciousness of their bodies. The first awareness of self for every human being comes through the mother’s touch and through the close contact with her body. Thus the first sense of self is the body sense, awakened by the mother’s care. This in turn encourages each child to explore his own body, beginning in infancy and continuing as he grows. When I first met Amy and Deborah, two of the children I worked with individually, they were psychotic in the autistic stage of development. They like the young infant, spent all of their time stimulating themselves. Their autistic gestures were ritualistic, highly stylized patterns of movement. Communication was then only possible in one way through our bodies. Since their tiny limited worlds were intensely physical, I tried to enter their worlds and speak their language by reflecting their movements. In the beginning, this was simply direct imitation. By doing what she was doing, I was trying to tell her that I liked her just the way she was without asking anything of her. I wanted her to know that she was safe to be completely herself. Then when she was ready, we could begin to share. 

01:09:25
[sil.] 

01:09:35
Each child within the safety of the room and situation, had I think begun to trust me. Up to now, she had permitted touch, but not enough to relax and become passive like a baby. Both girls were now in the earliest stage of symbiosis and spent most of their time wanting to be held. Perhaps it was at this point that they had begun to experience themselves as one of two people in a relationship and could then begin to grow and go through some crucial faces of normal development, which they missed the first time around. These children then begin to explore my body just as the normal child begins to explore the mother’s body. Mutual trust did now exist at the body level. It was beginning to look like a normal relationship. 

01:10:25
[sil.] 

01:10:45
If these adults have reached a better understanding of themselves in relation to their own bodies, perhaps, their words and actions can be more honestly reflective of what they really mean. Perhaps then there will be fewer difficulties in communicating with each other and with the children in their lives. After working with children in varying degrees of mental illness, I have learnt that body language can be the first means of successful communication. Sometimes, it can also be the basis from which verbal communication can grow. We can provide opportunities, in which they can be themselves, follow their internal rhythms and discover that their bodies can come alive through movement. Their bodies can then become a beautifully natural part of their speaking, of their listening, of their moving and growing through a time and space called childhood.
