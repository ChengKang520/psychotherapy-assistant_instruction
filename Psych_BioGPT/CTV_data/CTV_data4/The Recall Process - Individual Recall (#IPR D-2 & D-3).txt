DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) This next film is edited from a session between two resident advisors who are employed in an undergraduate dormitory. The young men was recently married and during the session he spoke about how difficult it was to be newly married and living in an apartment within a dormitory. He also spoke about his financial problems, his academic work, and most important of his concern that he had become known as the expert on minority problems, a role he had not chosen for himself. Here are segments from the inquirers' recall. 

00:01:25
Recall Session: Colleague 

00:01:25
DAN You know, as I told you before, I've been, I don't wanna be consider as a, as a specialist concerning both on quote(ph) and already type of the problem... (crosstalk) 

00:01:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:01:40
DAN ...coz I wanna hide(ph) for a minute. 

00:01:40
  It seems like that's really limiting to your skills. (crosstalk) 

00:01:45
DAN Great, great. 

00:01:45
 Then it, it assumes that you can only on(ph) with minority groups. 

00:01:50
DAN Great. And ah, you know, I'm going through my academic program, getting the same preparation as everyone else. 

00:01:55
 I was thinking down that, he was being short changed... (crosstalk) 

00:02:00
 Uh-huh. 

00:02:00
 ...biased by the staff because he was falling into just uhm, a minority problem thing. Uhm, if we have any minority problems or refer them to Dan, and a, in a way that's an insult that assumes that he doesn't have skills to deal with other people, gives him kind of a token position. And uhm, anything to say that. 

00:02:20
  Was this something that you are thinking about saying that? 

00:02:25
  Yeah, I wanted to express that, uhm, but it seem (inaudible ) going on with it, so I didn't. I wasn't sure it was necessary to stay(ph) there. 

00:02:35
  Is there a risk involve if you were to have said that? 

00:02:40
 Yes, it's kind, it's kind of a touchy subject I do, I do that too. I'm referring people... (crosstalk) 

00:02:45
  Uh hmm. 

00:02:50
 ...to him you know, under racial circumstances too, because I feel like he has more insight in dealing with it than I do at times. And yet, when he said that it occurred to me what I'm doing, and I was wondering in a way if he's saying that to me too, you know. 

00:03:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:03:05
 He's making a request to me. 

00:03:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:03:05
 Ah, I guess that, that is the risk to me in having said that to him more, wanting to say that to him, yeah. 

00:03:20
 Wanna go back? 

00:03:20
 Yeah. 

00:03:20
DAN  I was working yesterday, but and I don't wanna bother you with it. 

00:03:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:03:25
DAN So ah, you know, I'd, (crosstalk) 

00:03:30
 Wow, that was a heavy thing. I was on, I was on call yesterday and he had a problem someone in the hall came down to see him and rather than refer that person to me you know, he dealt with it. Uhm, I felt really guilty, I felt like uhm, I don't want to disturb you kind of things of you know, I'm making myself unapproachable or am I letting people know that I'm not available to them, uhm. 

00:04:00
  At, at the time when he told you that that's when you were feeling this? 

00:04:05
 Yeah. And you felt(ph) like he just said it now on the tape, I kinda felt like ah, hand around my stomach to squeeze it because Dan's a good friend. And my feeling is we need to rely on each other, I need to be able to know that he is there and he needs, I feel like he needs to know that I'm, I'm there to help him, too. 

00:04:25
 Do you recall the time when ah, when he said that and you had that feeling, was there something that you wanted to do with it? 

00:04:35
 I wanted, ah, I can remember the feeling of wanting to reach out referring(ph) to(ph), "Hey, you know, we're in this together, we're a team and if, we're gonna make it... (crosstalk) 

00:04:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:04:45
 we're gonna make it 'coz we can lean on each other and support each other." 

00:04:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:04:50
 Uhm, and I felt kinda stiff(ph) I didn't, I didn't do that. 

00:04:55
DAN  And I know we sit down discuss materials she knows everything in this(ph), so that's you know(ph) adding extra pressure and I feel like kinda bad, because I don't have the time to spend with her... (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:05:10
DAN ...to help her, (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:05:10
DAN you know, deal with (inaudible ) pressure because of that. (crosstalk) 

00:05:15
 Exactly. 

00:05:15
 Something that occurred to me there he seem like he had so much inside to get out, like he was talking, I mean he's talking quickly and it was like uhm, situation after situation of things that were pressing on him. Uhm, and I wanted some, I get, think I just wanted to hold him. 

00:05:35
DAN My academic program isn't that demanding but it's just a, the job and people always coming down and talking or bring their problems to me when I'm not on duty and maybe a lot of it, coz(ph), because my apartment right next to the office. I don't know. (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
 Sounds like you get to be a support person for a lot people. People in the hall and for Brenda and for some of the staff? 

00:06:00
DAN  Yeah. I've, that maybe true but Brenda don't think I'm pain(ph) as supported to her. (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
 To her as you should be. 

00:06:10
DAN Yeah, that should be. 

00:06:10
 He seemed tired. He seemed drained, and really drained of just working, and working and meeting so many people's demands and needs, (crosstalk) 

00:06:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:06:25
 that there wasn't much left there. Uhm, yeah, I feel like I'm feeling angry now. I'm feeling like, I'm wondering why he doesn't take care of himself, I wanting him to, to make time to go away. I'm really. 

00:06:45
 Is, is that for me to what's your feeling at the point we stopped? 

00:06:50
 I'd, I think I always more into a head thing than being, in touch with my own feeling of being angry with him. Uhm, I was warn(ph) to figuring out what was going on and, and trying to understand that in, in a problem solving thing, wanting to help him find the solutions so that it you know, he'd have time for things that were more important to him. Uhm, but I'm feeling angry now because that seems like something I got into last year of always being there and always having my door open and things never seeming to quit or go away. And realizing now that, that something that I set off, that I, I'm in control of that and feeling like his, maybe he's not aware of that yet like his, everything he does he wants to do well, he, he express that concern of taking on that responsibility. 

00:07:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:07:50
 Uhm. 

00:07:50
 Wa, was there some way that you wanted to, to convey that or convey something to him at the point we stopped with him? 

00:07:55
  Yeah. Uhm, I think though at that point I felt like shaking him and saying, "You know, why don't you go away for a weekend. Why don't you get out of here and go have a good time." 

00:08:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
 And he feeling like that wouldn't be helpful. Uhm, like he, maybe he'd already said that to himself. And the question was: No, why he wasn't doing it? Uhm, so that's kind of what I was at that time what I was feeling. 

00:08:25
  Any sense what were Dan was when he was talking about that? 

00:08:30
 Hmm. 

00:08:35
[sil.] 

00:08:35
  Uhm, I'm thinking now, he might have wanted somebody to do that, that he might have wanted someone to, to say, that maybe that something he doesn't dare say to himself uhm, "I don't need to be so responsible. I need to be responsible to myself and my wife too. And... (crosstalk) 

00:09:00
 Hmm. 

00:09:00
 ...not just to the hall and my academic program." 

00:09:00
DAN  I get married, and almost every, you know, developed my own lives there. 

00:09:05
  Uh-huh. 

00:09:10
DAN Ah, you know, it, it's adjustment enough to get married 'coz I'm a very independent person. 

00:09:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:09:15
DAN And I think(ph) to get married and, and ah, content with 13 of it, 1,300 other people you know, in, in a relationship. 

00:09:25
 That's crazy. To me that's insane. It seems you know, I'm not married, and I haven't been married but it seems as though does such a change in lifestyle that, that would be such an adjustment becoming sensitive to another person's needs and keeping communication open, and honest and quelling(ph) and making, trying to make that relationship work. 

00:09:45
 Uh-huh. 

00:09:45
  It's not, you, you know it's like a bee movie, you know finding yourself on your honeymoon, in, in a residents hall, where you are also trying to establish relationships of 13, 1,300 students and 32 staff members. And wow, that's why I cried(ph) out a rod sterlings twilight zone to me. It's. 

00:10:05
  Do you recall what you felt when he was you know, when he was describing at you? 

00:10:15
  Uhm, overwhelmed. Ah, and helpless to be able to change that. That's a situation he's in, that I'm in, but it's different for him, he's got some more variables happening, so more things happening in there now, for him. Uhm, and helplesses(ph) to, to be able to show him how to turn the mary go round of. 

00:10:45
 A body sensations to go with that? 

00:10:50
 Hmm. Yeah, yeah, a feeling of somebody is having put a big rock on my shoulder, on my back, of ah, the awareness of what he was carrying maybe. I was sitting there adding almost in my mind well, there's a financial burden we can't(ph) afford to get out of the hall, and uhm, there's people knocking at the door, and there's my academic program and there's Brenda's academic program and uhm. 

00:11:20
DAN  Ah, you know, the times that I would have not working in the hall I have to spend it in the classes which mean there, you know, give, bring this you know, is, would appear and she'd had to buy them and to turn with them. 

00:11:35
 Yeah. 

00:11:35
DAN And ah, you know, I don't, you know I don't wanna be that way what ah, you know she, she had been compromising that you know, seeing that she's, she is down there. 

00:11:45
  Since there she doesn't feel very important to you? No. 

00:11:50
 Now, that you, now what you've seen the completion, at least of the interview? Ah, any thoughts about something he might have wanted to have done but didn't? 

00:12:05
 With all the thoughts, uhm. 

00:12:10
 What? 

00:12:10
  Hmm, I think I would have wanted to focusing more on Dan. It seem like a pattern of uhm, trying to, to discuss with him how he was feeling and where he was, and he's taking, he would, hmm, looking at the whole thing now, he seemed to take that back uhm, to a concern that he had over everybody else and that was, is that what was happening in the interview is what's happening outside. Do, do... (crosstalk) 

00:12:45
 Okay. 

00:12:45
 ...do you know what I mean? 

00:12:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:12:45
 I'm not sure if that's very clear. I think I have a feeling that it was really hard for him to take something for himself to be given to and uhm, just to sit down and talk about how lousy he's feeling right now... (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:13:00
 ...that things are really rough. There's a lot of pressure on, he has a lot of commitments, responsibility uhm, the time he had to do that, he devoted to how hard it was for other people that he was dealing with alone(ph). 

00:13:15
 Any sense of how Dan saw you kind of, well, whether perhaps he might have seen you as someone different from the beginning 'til the end. 

00:13:25
  Hmm, I think my feeling now is that, at first he started out almost afraid that I wasn't gonna listen to him, that I was gonna start talking about how rough it was for me. And he was, he seemed to be talking very quickly and just gushing things, I felt like he was gushing things out. 

00:13:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
 And I think gradually maybe he, he felt that I was there to listen to him, and he began to slow down a bit to take sometime to reflect. So maybe he did get something on(ph). 

00:14:05
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  So here was an interview and recall in which there was no designated counselor and client. I wonder how many of these statements made by the woman during the recall could have been made directly to the young men. Isn't it intriguing that one of her last comments in the recall session is the realization that would then was doing with her was very similar to what then does with other people in his life. He worries about them, takes care of them, and focuses less on taking care of himself. 

00:14:40
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Are there more similarities than differences in the ways we interact with the people in our lives? Do we enter relationships with new people in ways which parallel the other relationships in our life? If this is true wouldn't the study of almost any relationship be, in effect, the study of all our relationships? What do you think?

DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  In this next film we have recorded a session between a teacher and their school administrator followed by the administrators' recall. 

00:16:20
Interview: School Administrator and Teacher 

00:16:20
SALLY  And when I came back and I said, "These things aren't the same you know, I need some help here and I need some help there." I felt even you, with you, with do they, you've said, "Okay, go fight it." And I want, I want from you, I want to say to you, "Help me fight it, you're getting paid to help me fight it, you're in charge a curriculum." If supplies is the issue, why don't you offer to go down to Mr.(ph) says(ph) office with me and say, "Okay, we have a problem." Not me I see that I'm fighting this problem by myself against the hundred other people and everybody saying, "Gee, that's too bad Sally, that's too bad. You ought to say this, you ought to say that." (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:17:05
SALLY And I want somebody to say, "Hey, it's not me alone." 

00:17:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:17:10
SALLY They're not that my kids, they are the school's kids. And. 

00:17:10
  You know it's interesting to hear you say that uhm, so the, the relationships were destroyed. Uhm, have you, have you in your own minds sort it how the depth of this relationships before you, before you left? 

00:17:25
SALLY  I think some of 'em uhm, I would have to think about that. I guess maybe when things are going well, you don't think about the depths of the relationships. And when you, the chips are down and you've, you're face with the nitty-gritty it's like then you really find out where they are, and maybe that's what hurt you know. I felt that I should be able to go see them, and say, "I'm having a problem, you know, and I want some help." I don't come to him everyday with the problem, I don't go to him once a year with the problem, once in five years I go to him and say, "I need some help." And he looks at me like I'm lying, like it's my fault that it's happened. And the frustrating part about it is, I don't feel like in you know, chitchat with this kind of logic. And so I'll, I'm left with face, facing 150 kids until June, dreaming of mickey mouse, cutesy little projects to do, to babysit 'em. 

00:18:25
 Ah, now, personally... (crosstalk) 

00:18:25
SALLY And it makes me angry. 

00:18:30
 ...I feel like I have to, I feel like that the decision to send you to talk to him alone was help because to talk to him myself about it, about a problem that I felt that I could not win anyway, and I thought the person would have to project themselve, and they're pull out your feelings and how it was made you feel, it's more than just a curriculum problem, it's more than just saying, "Order, order some more materials." Materials have been ordered at first they were stolen while you are away, and it's more than I want him to know how you feel about it, not just order more materials. So there's, there's, there's more involved in that. And that's why I sent you alone. Uhm, ah, do you think that I've, I've forsook you sending you alone? 

00:19:15
SALLY  Kinda. I went to him alone the first time. 

00:19:20
 Okay. 

00:19:20
SALLY And that's when I got nothing other than he run to you and said he didn't believe that all these things are gone. So I felt like I did that initially. And then when I came around and said to people, That didn't work." In essence that's what I said, "That didn't work." You know, now what I do, it's like, "Go back and do it again." Well, I could be going back until May but that doesn't eliminate my problem. And you know, I can work around the issue of supplies, I think I'm creative enough and resourceful enough to work around that issue. I guess... (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
 Hmm. 

00:19:50
SALLY  you know, the main thing to me is that it really hurt my feelings. 

00:19:55
 Would it make you feel better if I where with you? 

00:20:00
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:20:00
 Ah, what have you accomplished then ah, as far as these uhm, diminishing relationships with the rest of his staff? 

00:20:10
SALLY Maybe it would make my relationship feel stronger with you. See, I would think wow, here is somebody that I really go to bath for me. 

00:20:15
 I think that's (inaudible ) okay. 

00:20:20
SALLY You know. Yeah. And that's asking you to do a lot, I know that. And I don't think I would do it with the intention of testing our relationship, but I feel that there have been times when people have said things about you, and I've supported you. And from my heart I've supported you. I think you know me well enough to know that if I didn't, I would be in the first one to be in agreement with them after cutting somebody down, "Well, yeah, you're right you know." But I really have supported you and I've supported the other administrators, but boy, when it goes the other way I just don't have that feeling. (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
 Tell me this Sally has this ah, not understanding the problem. Uhm, okay now, ah, I'm really feeling that you're, you're disappointed with me for not going in and fighting the battle with you. All right, uhm, ah, I really haven't gotten that uhm, this none support by administrators, you know, is that across the board, the four of us. 

00:21:15
SALLY Uh-huh. 

00:21:15
 Is that across the board kind of thing... (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
SALLY For myself...(crosstalk) 

00:21:20
 ...since you've been back? 

00:21:20
SALLY ...or for all teachers? 

00:21:20
 Since you've been back. No, just for you. 

00:21:20
SALLY  Uhm, yeah, I think it's across the board. And so what's your probably thinking is that's my hang up and not theirs. 

00:21:30
 No. 

00:21:30
SALLY Maybe you're right. Uhm, you know it's like when I was out one day you know, my classes were full I come back and somebody's put seven more students under one class. Seven more students that nobody else will take, seven more students that well, you know, reap everything off and then if I'm gone everybody can say, "Boy, Sally's classes are terrible." 

00:21:50
 I know(ph) let mes, let me tell you how I interpret that seven more students... (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
SALLY Okay. 

00:21:55
 ...in your classes particularly. To you it's not a complement. To me perhaps, maybe it means that seven more students went to a place that, where they could learn, where they could get individual attention, where they could get a little extra help, where seven more students really didn't mean seven more bodies to take care for a teacher. Now, there are teachers in our building, I'm sure that seven more students will have climbed in a wall. I thought that seven more wouldn't bother you. 

00:22:30
SALLY It doesn't bother me, I mean I can handle seven more students that bothers me in effect, if I'm willing to load my classes to 41 and 39, (crosstalk) 

00:22:40
 Uh-huh. 

00:22:40
SALLY And when I stick up my hand and say, (crosstalk) 

00:22:40
 Say, "I need something." 

00:22:40
SALLY "I need a little help." 

00:22:40
  Yeah. 

00:22:45
SALLY And everybody says, "Well, what do you mean?" 

00:22:45
 Right. 

00:22:45
SALLY You know, it's kind of uhm, it's like I want to say, "Can't you see some other things I'm doing and if indeed you can, then give me the things that I need to do it with, you know, I'm not Virgin Mary." 

00:23:00
 I see some little concern here with whether or not you gonna get the supplies, ah. 

00:23:05
SALLY I'm given up on that. 

00:23:05
 I think you, ah, I think that, that's bothering you very much. It's not bothering me in a weeks(ph) but, because I know that a teacher cannot operate in that classroom without the supplies, and mind you Sally they will magically appear shortly. So that's not my bother. The bother is that, that you are upset about it and uhm, the kind of support that you get it. Ah, I'm more interested in that, that attitude and that support being carried through on other things because it's not, I'm seeing a surface thing here. 

00:23:40
SALLY Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
 And I do(ph), I think it's probably much deeper than in what your... 

00:23:45
SALLY I think what bothers me worthy(ph) is a fact that can't convince him that I can't teach without supplies, I can't convince him that they are really gone. Uhm, and so I'm just ready to throw my hands up and say, " Okay all cra, crawl into my room and you will never see me again for the rest of the year because its not the hassle. 

00:24:05
 I see. Well... (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
SALLY And I, uh-huh. 

00:24:05
 ...you convinced him that you cannot teach without them, definitely you have. I think you have, you don't know that you have but you have to arrest(ph) him. 

00:24:15
SALLY Well then, why does he have to ah, make such an issue of, "I might not be telling the truth." You know, I have a real hang up about honesty, and ah, one thing I don't do is lie. You know, I don't lie to kids, I don't lie to administrators, I don't lie to other teachers. You take out, you know, a lot of craft for always telling the truth, but, you know, I don't do it, and he's saying thing to me the biggest insult anybody could say to me, "I don't believe you." 

00:24:40
 Did he say, "I don't believe you," point blank, or did he say, "Is it possible for an entire seven dozen of paint brushes to be missing?" 

00:24:50
SALLY He said that he and this man from down town did not believe it in the lounge Ruthie(ph), in front of about seven people, that's the sign. (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
 All right. Let's, let's forget about the down town, but when, you see what I'm getting at Sally, (clears throat) he only wants to buy a minimum of whatever he has to buy. If your order was missing, when you got back from being sick(ph). He doesn't wanna buys seven dozen paint brushes, he'd like to get by with buying five. 

00:25:15
SALLY  Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
 And he's not really saying that you're lying that the whole seven dozen are missing, all the twenty dozen of a... (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
SALLY (inaudible ) 

00:25:26
 ...Elmer's glue were missing. He, he only wants to buy the minimum, so he's trying to establish uhm, reason for buying the minimum, and that's all. And I think you maybe taking that very personal. 

00:25:35
SALLY Yeah, I am taking it personally. I wish that he could see that I'm taking it personally. 

00:25:40
 Have you told him that you feel this way? 

00:25:45
SALLY In that letter you know, that I'd showed you and I wrote, I think, uhm, and that's one thing I will said, I'm glad that you helped me rewrite that letter, that really did make me feel good. 

00:25:55
 And that you would be. 

00:25:55
Recall Session: Director 

00:25:55
SALLY  I've felt even if you has been you said, "Okay, go find it." And I want, I want from you(ph), I wanna say to you, "Help me find it. You're getting paid to help me find it, you're in-charged of curriculum." 

00:26:20
 Uhm, this ah, I, I did not know that, that Sally would felt that I wasn't doing my job. And when down to me, that she felt like, their administration is not much, in fact, there are, are not much good, not effective, not doing her job, and you're a part of it too, and you're not doing your job, and I feel like, you could do better. I felt about like crawling on that rag, I felt really low, low, low, and uhm, uhm, I wanna to yell out ins, ah, and scream, "Hey, wait a minute, the battles that I fight for people, you'll never know." I want it to, you know, I wanted to say, I was tempted to say, "Hey, wait a minute Sally, you don't know what." But I all ready been in there on your behalf, I didn't go with you, but I've discussed this issue with (inaudible ). 

00:27:21
 The way you think Sally was saying you, do, do you have any ideas of the feeling she was having toward you? As. (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
 Uhm, I, I, I, I quickly told myself that uhm, it's not the first time somebody has felt that way, it probably would not be the last time that somebody felt that way, but I'm not doing enough, when behind the scene I felt I was. I think I came out of it, that, that uhm, that moment, feeling better when I, when I talk to myself and said, "Uhm, uhm, you'll never know." 

00:28:00
 Hmm. 

00:28:00
 It kinda like uhm, to own a job when uhm, she just never know what I tried to do for. And I don't think that explaining all of that, would help but any(ph). Ah, ah, I don't think teachers, teachers have to know, all, all the battles that she go through on her behalf. 

00:28:20
 Do you have any special feelings as you said on, on all of that decided not to share? 

00:28:25
 Uhm, I felt lonely, very lonely. 

00:28:30
  Yeah(ph). 

00:28:35
 Well, probably not as lonely as I, I felt. She was here with me, I could not erase that, as she, that her presence was still here. (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
  Uh hmm. 

00:28:45
 But then, the kind of quote, unquote loneliness, not as lonely as it is sometimes when I shut my office door, and there's nobody there but it was like you left there alone. 

00:28:55
 Can you remember anything else at that point? 

00:28:55
  I thought I did not going home and I, (laughs) not even trying to address the problem anymore, 'coz I feel like she, she just said, "You would be gang and, and the gang, the gang, gang, gang isn't work as a gang, it's not with insult and I thought I meant live it more and not her. 

00:29:25
  Any idea what kept you going, kept you with her? 

00:29:30
  Well, I climb back into my administrative bag(ph), you know, and ah, could to big(ph), uhm, and often a lot of times you have hear people say that you're not doing as suppose to or you have the, you, ah, you, often our times you have to let other people ah, express their hurts, without them being aware of that could to very, very hurt. 

00:30:00
 Did you have any feel for what was going on with Sally at this time? Feelings on her part. 

00:30:05
  No, I can really sympathized with her. You see, very recently I've been sick myself, and I came back, and I really have the same feelings too, rather than, wow, what shall makes you... (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
  Uh hmm. 

00:30:25
 ...you do a good job, when you're here. 'Coz we had a bigger job and we found that it was a good... (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:30:30
 ...do a good job. 

00:30:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:30:30
 Well, in that we found out, ah, I, I felt the same way. Ah, we couldn't get this going, 'coz you are here. Uhm, the student go 'coz are here, and if I had time to do this 'coz you (inaudible ). It was not, it was not, I, I've, I can sympathize with Sally, I know, I know, just the feeling, makes you (inaudible ), 'coz I have to know, that I think(ph) you cannot sit there for the rest of the year, wasn't a supplies with stolen once you sitting at, she cannot seat there and with anything so whose gonna come up to supply the (inaudible ), well, she's not that confident that, that they will come up. 

00:31:10
 Okay. Anything else? 

00:31:10
SALLY  I would have to think about that, I guess, maybe when the things are going wrong you don't think about the depths of the relationships, and when your tips(ph) are down and you, you're face with the nitty-gritty, it's like then, you really find out where they are, and maybe that's what hurts you know, I felt that I should be able to goes (inaudible ) and say, "I may having a problem you know, and I want some help." I don't. 

00:31:40
 All right. Right there I can remember the feeling, uhm, why don't she tell him all the stuff? I, I can remember asking myself, "Can we cope, this?" Does he know really how you feel? And then I can remember stopping char(ph) and saying to myself, "When she's coming again, because she can't talk to him." The reason she's coming to you is 'coz she can't talk to him. 

00:32:10
 Uh hmm. What to that realization do to you? 

00:32:10
  Made me feel good for the first time in this whole interview, made me feel really good. 

00:32:15
  And I thought the person will have to project himself in there, pour out your feeling, and how its made you feel, it's more than just the curriculum problem. It's more than just saying, "Order, orders some more materials." Materials have been ordered at first, they were stolen while you're away and it's more than, I want him to know how you feel about it, not just order more materials. There is, there's, there's more involve in it and that's why I sent you a letter. Uhm, ah, do you think that I've, I've forsook you sending your letter(ph). 

00:32:55
SALLY Kinda, I want to him along the first time. 

00:32:55
 Okay. 

00:32:55
SALLY And that's when I got nothing rather than he ran to you and said he didn't believe, that all these things were gone, so I felt. 

00:33:05
  Do you think I've forsook you? I'm really trying to find how much I have hurt her. I kinda feeling like touche, I've finally got to say, " I have helped you." But I don't think I heard it when you said it, just trying to find a way to say, "I have helped you," stops, just stop jabbering long enough to listen to what I got to say, "I have helped you." And I think I got it in without hurting your feelings. But now, I wanna know, you know, like ah, uhm, are you still hurt? Now, that you know, that I, that I've helped you. 

00:33:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:33:50
  What I thought help, was helped, you know, help is opinionated, like I thought during that, she thought I hadn't. I'm really trying to find out what, are these feelings still there, now that you know. 

00:34:10
 Ruthie(ph) how did you want her to see you, did you have an idea at this point? 

00:34:15
 I'm really trying to change that dogged feelings she had about me when she came in there, (laughs) that I hadn't done anything, I'm trying to change all that, without really pointing out the truth, without really telling it all, and that's very difficult. 

00:34:30
 Do you think that was starting to happen, that she was... (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
 I think, it is. 

00:34:30
 ...trying to see you differently? 

00:34:35
 I think it is. 

00:34:35
SALLY It didn't work in that sense that's what I said, " That didn't work," you know, now, what I do, it's like, "Go back and do it again." Oh, I could be going back until May, but that doesn't eliminate my problem. 

00:34:45
  I try to be loyal to two different things, right there. The reason I didn't say more probably. I'm trying to be loyal to the boss, be loyal to uhm, to her to but, by uhm, well, I just trying to serve two masters right there, (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:35:11
 And what did that feel like to be caught in that place? 

00:35:11
  Well, I've caught there a lot of times. Uhm, I'm beginning to adjust that a feeling like I can drag it up pretty, pretty, pretty quickly now. 

00:35:25
 And what did that feel like? 

00:35:25
  You know, you feel like you're caught in the middle, there's a, a tractor coming from one of the end and a bulldozer from another end, you caught in the middle you really doesn't matter what she go, what to do, you know, we get ah, tight squeezing anyway, you didn't moved. 

00:35:40
  Any fantasies of what you wanted to happen 'coz you were in that place? 

00:35:50
[sil.] 

00:35:50
  I just want Sally stop pushing from her in(ph) probably. Uhm, not pushing to get her surprise, I wanna to get those. Uhm, probably just pushing from what move, pushing from a personally point, where she's not gonna win. 

00:36:15
  Were you tempted to share that with her? 

00:36:20
  No. 

00:36:25
 Anything else? 

00:36:25
SALLY  Like I'm creative enough and resourceful enough to work around that if you, I guess, you know, the main thing to me is that every week. 

00:36:35
 Creative enough, resourceful enough. I kept thinking to myself, who you trying to fool Sally. Sally is one of the most sensitive person in the state(ph), creative, true. I would upfront(ph) very, very strong. Ah, she, she admits ah, a very important thing there the staff would see her as being aggressive. I see her as being very aggressive outwardly but with some really dipsy, deeper, uhm, weaknesses deep down inside. And that's why she's coming in (inaudible ). She was so aggressive, she might try(ph) in there (inaudible ), now, you know, I'm suppose to have these supplies, you know, it wouldn't be a big deal(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:37:25
 It's that, that weakness instead to bring to you today or to talk to me. 

00:37:30
 Any thoughts of dealing with that? 

00:37:35
  No. Our weaknesses, I need more than any other personnel staff, I don't think. 

00:37:45
SALLY You know, and I really have supported you, and I've supported the other administrators. But, will I don't. 

00:37:50
 Okay. Now, Sally, I'm well aware of what Sally is saying that she really has supported me. And when she got (inaudible ) know any ah, seventy-five percent of (inaudible ) teacher's lounge, it gets back to us anyway . We get it, and I do know that Sally has gone back from(ph) I've heard that before, I didn't hear it was Sally but I know. 

00:38:10
 Any feelings about Sally, as you thought about that? 

00:38:15
 I can remember saying, " You are a person to have to go to buy(ph) for you(ph) 'coz you are so vocal." And when you go to that for somebody. There's not once in the other staffroom(ph) that could say for sure. So if I have to have you by going that for me, I want it to be Sally. 

00:38:30
  Do you think she pick upon on there? 

00:38:35
 Hmm, I don't think I will, I let her know when we are not, not, not here, I just listen. But I can remember thinking to myself. You're, you know, you're the kind of person, I'm illustrating(ph) what's in the, enough(ph), enough(ph) of staffroom. 

00:38:55
 To you its not compliment. To me perhaps, maybe, it means(ph) that seven more students would(ph) replaced there, or they could learn, that it could get individual attention, or they could get a little extra help. Where seven more students really didn't mean a seven more buddies(ph) to take care of for a teacher. There, there are. 

00:39:15
 Okay I'm trying whip her with kindness. I'm really beaten her. I call myself uhm, killing her the nicest way I know how. You see when I get to you that Sally(ph), ah, a whole, uhm, this has taking about seven more students. "I wanna(ph) be really star(ph)," she said that. So, I'm just you know, kinda see(ph) your honey, sweeten and, and like, I think you are a good teacher. Seven more students doesn't bother you, does it Sally?" But what I come out with ah, I didn't win on that one. What I come out with, yeah, it does bother me, watch this. 

00:39:55
  I'm sure that seven more students uhm, climbing the wall. I thought that seven more wouldn't bother you. 

00:40:05
SALLY It doesn't bother me, I mean, I can handle seven more students, it bothers me in the fact, if I'm willing to divide(ph) my classes to 41 and 39 and when I was stuck-up my... (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
 See. 

00:40:15
SALLY ...hand and say, "Well, you know. 

00:40:15
 See there, I still get in a sudden, I didn't, I didn't go where I follow going to that way. In fact, I lost (inaudible )... (crosstalk) 

00:40:24
  Do it with that feeling(ph)? 

00:40:25
 I blew it. Uhm, I didn't get across to her that, that ah, we put him(ph) in there 'coz, she's the only one to handle those, you might call a bombers, whatever, even when you call them gamers, you realized we often really inside of the game we digress all the time or a different problem in time seven more student. I really forgot in what, what we meant(ph) with that, let's listen. 

00:40:50
SALLY  Yeah, and everybody as well what do you mean there? You know, it's kind of uhm, it's like I wanna say, "Can't you see some of the things I'm doing, and if indeed, you can, then give me the things that I need to do it with, you know, I'm not Virgin Mary." 

00:41:10
 I says with (inaudible ) that said at here with, 'coz I'm not going get the supplies, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
SALLY I've given up on that. 

00:41:15
 I think you, I, I think that that's bothering you very much, it's not bothering you this but, 'coz I know. But a teacher cannot operate in their classroom without the supplies, and mind you Sally, they will magically appear shortly. So that's now when I've got rivet(ph). 

00:41:35
  You think she feels any better, I wonder. 

00:41:40
 Did you have any thoughts about that? 

00:41:45
 Huh, I was trying to tell them, we already other them, the staffs she's telling about, we already get on(ph). It's not my place to tell at that though, see, that's the principal's place to say, " In a while he is (inaudible ) about," with all(ph) and would not our, you, the hours(ph) already gone into you, you not even know it but, it's not my place to say, "The staffs went on it, don't worry badly(ph)." If he wanna hurt to feel that way (inaudible ) then he ca, would do that. He's gone, he's gonna give a hard time half alone or how much has been stolen, and, and what kind of stuff. And so I say, "No, he can reorder it anyway." I know that. And I think Sally knows that too. 

00:42:35
SALLY Huh? 

00:42:35
 You con, you convinced(ph) to me, you cannot teach without them, definitely you can? (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
 I'm trying to tell. 

00:42:40
 I think you have. 

00:42:40
  I'm trying to tell lady(ph) to supplies the order. How do, how you, you know, I say you convinced him, you convinced yourself. And you see them with those two masters(ph) again, I'm trying to tell the teacher to cool it, you get the supplies, and I'm not trying that you serp(ph) the principal's power, 'coz his, his job to tell you that, if you want her(ph) to know it. 

00:43:05
  Did you have an idea of where you wanted, how you wanted at the end? 

00:43:10
  Forget the problem, 'coz I knew the problem have been solved. I want it Sally to feel better about administrators when she left me. 

00:43:20
  Did you want her to feel any differently about you? 

00:43:25
 Definitely. (inaudible )forget. 

00:43:30
 How did wanna feel about? 

00:43:30
 Well, I want to come out behind of the rug and in up on top of the rug, if you got low, you know, at least be on top of the rug. 

00:43:40
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) Did you notice how Ruthies(ph) feelings were hurt almost immediately in the interview, with other being any obvious sign of that, and how she then proceeded to spend much of her time, in a duly match with Sally. Isn't that also interesting how quickly emotions changed. Do you see how guilt shifted to anger. Remember when Ruth is said, "I'm wondering how much I have hurt her?" Then almost immediately, she says, "Aha, I felt touche, I finally got back at her." Did you ever wonder what would have happened if at least some of the things Ruthie(ph) said during recall had been said in the interview itself. For instance, if she had said, "I thought I meant more to you than that." That hurts, now that you have seen, what it was like to study yourself in a recall session. Do you see the value of this kind of review? Certainly, the degree of objectivity achieved is informative, but truly amazing is how much we've really do know about what's happening between us and another person. Much more than we realize, for the recalled process, we improve our ability to recognize powerful feelings, thoughts and sensations that we were either only semi-aware of at the time of the interaction or unwilling to acknowledge to the other person. In addition, you may have begun to recognize the possibility of dealing more purposefully with these thoughts and emotions. For this reason, this unit is a central part of the IPR process. Rather than being controlled by our hidden thoughts and feelings. We now have an increased awareness of them, as a result, we can improve our effectiveness by controlling or by recognizing that these are an important part of what may lie beneath the surface of any conversation. As we become more aware of the many levels that exist within an interaction, we will be better able to monitor these levels, thereby improving the quality of our interactions and our ability to help others.
