DR. DERALD WING SUE  My name is Derald Wing Sue. I'm Professor of Psychology and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University. Ah, welcome to our first in a series of videos, some of the topic of racism and antiracism. Today's presentation is on the Psychology of Racism: Where have we gone wrong? Ah, this will be followed by three other tapes in the future. One of them deals with what does it mean to be white? The invisibility of whiteness that we will talk about the deconstruction of whiteness and how whiteness serves as an invisible veil that prevents us from seeing issues that deal with race and racism. The third videotape will be based on overcoming personal racism: What can I do? And the third and last one deals with surviving racism, which is a personal message to my brothers and sisters of color. This series of training tapes is intended to take you on a multicultural journey that confronts one of the most pressing social issues facing our society, that of racism. The journey you take is likely to be filled with unpleasant insights about yourself, as a racial cultural being, and the realization that you share responsibility for the pain and suffering caused to others. To be successful on this journey, however, means that you must have the courage and integrity to engage in several antiracism tactics. First, you must be willing to tolerate the unpleasantness associated with an honest appraisal of your biases and prejudices. This is a very difficult task. Anytime that I have pushed racism into the minds of viewers or of the audience, what generally happens is that we, you are filled with feelings of guilt, anger, defensiveness, hopelessness, and many other feelings that serves to block your exploration into yourself as a racial cultural being. So today, I ask you not to allow these feelings ah, to block you from exploring yourself. Second, you must begin to challenge your own racial reality. You must understand yourself as a racial cultural being and how it potentially distorts your image or view of race and racism. For example, there is a little doubt that White Americans and people of color have a dish, different racial reality from one another. For example, in the O.J. Simpson trial, it was interesting that surveys were taken of both white and black, ah, people in the public and it's found that many African Americans tended to entertain the possibility of police misconduct. This was far different from wany(ph), many white citizens who tended not to believe that the police could act in such a way. We will talk about this because one's world view is based upon the social-political realities that people experience. Third, you cannot continue to view racial ethnic minority groups as disloyal aliens in their own country. You must begin to understand the world view that you have developed through, not only experiential reality but instead, through experiential reality rather than the images fed to you by the mass media and the educational system. Let me give you an example of what I'm talking about in, in this, uhm, ah, particular respect about viewing people of color as aliens and not Americans, which is part of our second tape about the invisibility of whiteness. Several years ago, I was asked to keynote a conference in Washington D.C. I was riding in a cab after getting out at Dulles Airport headed to downtown, uhm, ah, D.C. when the cab driver and I began to engage in, uhm, ah, delightful conversation of the, ah, Tyson-Holyfield Fight. Many of you recall that, ah, ah, Tyson bit off a portion of Holyfield's ear and ah, this happened several days ago and so the cab driver and I were sharing our thoughts of, on this particular issue. As we came to the hotel, he turned to me and said to me in a very complimentary fashion, "You know you speak very good English." Now I thank him for that but it really had an impact on me in terms of making me feel, again like I was not, that he did not perceived me as part of ah, the American public here. Directly following that, another incident occurred to me. Ah, after my keynote address, generally what happens is people in the audience might come up and talk to you about the presentation. One white woman came up to me and said to me directly, "Professor Sue you know ah, I really enjoyed your presentation this evening, ah, where were you born?" My immediate respond was that "Oh, I was born in Portland, Oregon." She smiled and said "No, no, no, no, where were you born?" She started enunciating in this way and I said "I was born in Portland, Oregon." She again said "No, no, no, what country where you born in?" Again I said that "The United States." At that point she immediately in an embarrassed fashion left ah, the podium after thanking me. Now these two examples are prime examples of ah, of what many of people of color experience, and I know that regardless of the intentions of the cabdriver or the woman who came up to me, both of them are well-intentioned individuals who carried on a conversation and enjoyed ah, ah, what I was saying but at the same time began to perceive me as an alien in my own country. I know that the woman expected me say that "Oh I was born in Asia, in Hong Kong, in Taiwan," some other country. And this makes it very difficult oftentimes for white individuals to see people of color as a part of this country and society. And last, I think that you must take personal action to combat your biases or prejudices and the unfair practices of our society. You must work to uphold our nation's values of inclusion, respect, fairness, guided by the principles of social justice. This indeed is one of the most difficult aspects in my teaching with students who want to work toward social justice. Because in essence, to combat racism, is to go uphill or to, to swim upstream. Ah, many factors will force you to, to retreat into the way that you have always been. Now why is this multi-cultural journey so important? In 1997, I was invited to testify before President Clinton's Race Advisory Board. Ah, this was organized by another colleague ah, a Dr. James Jones who wanted us to be the first to talk about the psychology of racism. Three of us were invited, one of them was Dr. James Jones, the second was Dr. Jack Dovidio and myself. Ah, Dr. Jones talked about the historical embeddedness of racism throughout the history of the United States. Dr. Dovidio talked about the evolution of old fashion racism towards modern contemporary forms of racism, and I was to speak on the, what the average American citizen could do to overcome and combat racism. It was during that testimony and the aftermath that I realized several things. This was primarily because all of us received hate mail in terms of our testimony that was shown on CNN and ah, a number of broadcasts throughout the nation. One of the realizations, I ah, went away with, was that bigotry and racism continue to be two of the most divisive forces in our society. It was clear to me that our presentation had pushed buttons in people and that they responded very strongly, claiming that we were racists but of a different color. The second point is the need to address issues of race, culture and ethnicity as never been more urgent. This is especially true when we realize that on September 11th, the tragedy that struck the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center by the terrorists brought home the fact that we were not as safe as many of us believe ah, ah, domestically. But what happened after that was an increased in racial profiling and it brought to mind something very important that we need to be able to distinguish terrorists from our many loyal Muslim brothers and sisters. Third, most of us in this nation seem ill-prepared to deal with topics of race and racism. We all seem to operate under what I called the "politeness protocol." In academia I call it the "academic protocol" where talking about racial issues, are, are submerged or hidden for the sake of ah, much more equal and free types of interactions. So that being honest in dialogue is a very important element here. A, a fourth ah, ah, you know ah, factor of importance is that I have discovered that racial legacies of the past continue to affect current policies and practices of the present, creating unfair disparities between racial ethnic minority groups and Euro-American groups. Now I understand when many of my white brothers and sisters tell me uhm, a statements like ah, "I didn't own slaves, why blame me," "I didn't take ah, a part in the, ah, a genocide of the American ah, Indians nor did I take away their land." What I'm trying to communicate here is that yes, you probably and were not responsible for these acts on a personal individual basis, but these legacies of the past ah, create conditions where many White Americans and others continue to benefit from the disparities and injustice that occurred historically. The fifth type of ah, teaching I learned from this was that such inequities are often so deeply ingrained in American society that they are nearly invisible. It's this invisible veil of a bias discrimination and stereotyping that is part and ah, parcel of what we called modern racism. The sixth ah, ah, lesson, the greatest challenge I think that our nation faces is how we can become a multi-cultural society which values equal access and opportunity. And the last and seventh point that I've learned from this testimony was that our greatest hope in solving problems of prejudice, discrimination is an honest examination of ourselves as racial cultural beings. Let me briefly frame my presentation today along the themes of where I believe we have gone wrong in the quest to eliminate or eradicate racism. Much I, much of what I will talk about ah, today comes from only, ah, from over 30 years of research and worked as a psychologist in the field of racism, and much of these, is also based upon other psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists and humanists in our society who have also worked hard to understand the causes, manifestations and effects of racism. There are essentially three forms of racism that we will begin to look at through the series of training tapes. In the individual racism is any attitude or action whether intentional or unintentional, conscious or unconscious, which subordinates a person, a group because of their color. Now this varies from the overt hate crimes that we hear about to the unintentional bias and discrimination that occurs in everyday life. A second form of racism is institutional racism. Institutional racism is any institutional policies, practices and structures in governments, businesses, unions, schools, churches, courts and law enforcement entities by which decisions are made to unfairly subordinate persons of color while allowing other groups to benefit and profit. Now examples of institutional racism involve things like housing patterns, segregated schools, discriminatory employment and promotion policy, racial profiling, inequities and health care, segregated churches and educational curriculum which ignore or distort the histories of people of color. The third form of racism is what we call cultural racism, perhaps the most insidious form of racism. It is the individual and institutional expression of the superiority of one groups' cultural heritage, their arts, their crafts, their language, traditions, beliefs and values over another groups. This was exemplified uhm, during the Reagan administration. Now many of you recalled that President Reagan when he was elected president was petitioned by Native Americans to meet in a council with the, the, their chiefs. Reagan sent a, ah, ah, another individual to meet with them which indeed insulted and ah, really felt bad to Native Americans because their Chiefs were all represented and they felt that the courteous thing to do was to meet with President Reagan, considered also a chief. Now ah, they as a result, ah, were disgruntled by this ah, insult that they felt was delivered to them. Ah, when President Reagan traveled to the Soviet Union, unbeknownst to him, a contingent of Native Americans also went to the Soviet Union. During a press conference that was held between the Soviet leader and ah, President Reagan, the Native American ah, contingent asked the Soviet press if they could address their chief. Of course the Soviet Union ah, were more than ah, happy to have this ah, dialogue ah, aired throughout their Republic, ah, broadcasting system as well. What happened was that ah, as Reagan was summarizing ah, the talks, this group of Native Americans approached the microphone and began to talk about the broken treaties and wanted to address their chief ah, ah of the United States. Reagan was taken aback by this but ah, at the same time was quite cool and offered apology to the American Indians stating that ah, ah, that he apologize that ah, the United States tried to civilize the primitive culture of American ah, Indian. And so, what I am saying is that this represents an example I believe of cultural racism where you believe that indeed your arts, your language, your crafts, your customs is superior ah, and better than another ah, ah, cultural group. Now rather than beginning ah, today's talk with an academic and sterile(ph) presentation of research, let me share with you examples of what I believe illustrates what had gone wrong in our understanding and study of ah, racism. Ah, because there is a major difference between the overt, old fashion forms of racism and the covert, insidious modern forms of racism. Ah, in 1989, Patrick Purdy fired a 105 rounds from the assault rifle at students at an elementary schoolyard in Stockton California, killing five Southeast Asian children before, shooting himself. He blamed all minorities especially the Chinxs(ph) and the Japs for taking away jobs from the American people. On August 9, 1997, Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant was arrested by New York police officers who took him to their 70th Precinct Station House. Once there, the officers dragged him handcuffed to the ah, bathroom where he was brutally sodomized with ah, toilet plunger. Four officers were charged with racism and police brutality, they were all indicted. Several years back, in the Superior Court of the State of California, a judge made highly racist and derogatory comments to Hispanic, to a Hispanic family. He said a young Hispanic juvenile was lower than an animal, had no moral upbringing and his pregnant sister was doomed to a life of three or four marriages. He accused the Mexican people of being miserable, lousy and rotten, having no rights to live among human beings and stated that perhaps Hitler was right in advocating genocide for certain groups. In Jasper, Texas, many of you still recall this where James Byrds, Jr. was kidnapped, savagely beaten, chained to pickup truck and dragged to death while his body was practically shredded and torn apart. Police found racist tattoos on the bodies of three assailants and racist literatures in their homes. Twenty-one year old Benjamin Nathaniel Smith went on a shooting spree several years ago over the July 4th Holiday, targeting Jews, Asians and African-Americans. He wounded six Orthodox Jews, killed an Asian-American and an African-American before shooting himself. White supremacist, Buford Furrow, in Granada Hills wounded several Jewish children and killed Joseph Ileto, a Filipino-American postal worker because he was non-White and a government worker. And many of us know that not too long ago, Matthew Shepard, ah, a gay white student in Wyoming was viciously tortured, beaten and killed by two white men. And we have heard the case of Amadou Diallo, ah, a Black man shot 19 times in New York City in a hail of 41 bullets. These highly visible incidents often lead us to one of the major problems which has hindered our understanding of racism. And this can be stated in what I call myth number one, myths tend to have a truthful component and an extremely false component as well. The myth goes like this, racism is wrong, prejudice, discrimination and stereotyping are pathological only the skinheads, the neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan, and white supremacists are bigoted, bias and racists, good and decent Americans do not discriminate. I think no one But white supremacists would deny that these are ugly hate crimes, that they are racists, homophobic, anti-Semitic, and that those who engage in such actions should be severely punished. This near unanimous outcry against hate groups and their condemnation are both sources of comfort to me and disturbing. As a psychologist who had spent nearly my entire professional life studying racism and anti-racism, I am aware that our abhorrence of racist acts may seduce us into the following belief: we are not like them, racists are only the skinheads, the Klan, the white supremacists, I don't discriminate. I am not prejudice because I believe in equality. If we focus on racism as only extreme acts of hatred, then we've reassured ourselves that we are not capable of prejudice, bias and discrimination. That is really the key point that I want to get across today. That racism is not simply extreme acts of hatred, that it is manifest oftentimes unintentionally, unconsciously and in a very subtle way that can cause equally damaging experiences and effects for persons of color. Almost all recent findings on racism suggest several trends in the evolution of it which challenges this false conception that ah, of the myth I am talking about. Finding number one, traditional racism which is consciously expressed by way of racial hatred and overt hostility receives the greatest share of news media attention. These are individuals who often intentionally act out their hatred in obvious and dramatic ways. I've given many examples of these earlier in the cases ah, I've read. Finding number two, most Americans would clearly label these individuals as pathological, evil, filled with hatred and willingly condemn and punish them. Yet there are something very seductive and insidious about labeling racists as only the Buford Furrows, the Patrick Purdys and the una- ah, Nathaniel Smiths of the world. It makes it easy for us to say that racists are only those people, the skinheads, the Klan, the White Supremacists, they are not like me. To give you an example of what I'm in concerned about, concerning this ah, ah, point occurred several years ago when I attended the American Counseling Association keynote address by a Morris Dees, Chief Legal Counsel and director of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Ah, Mr. Dees is well-known for his fight against skinheads and White supremacists. The Southern Poverty Law Center is well-known for its teaching tolerance programs and I went there to listen to his words of wisdom, also to honor the man, a white, Southerner who worked hard to combat and fight uhm, ah, racism. I recalled that during his presentation, he was extremely eloquent; he talked about his ah, work against the white supremacists, about the killings that occurred and asked the general audience a question that was very important. He asked whose America is it. Is it the America of the White supremacists? Or is it the America of those who's vision of multiculturalism? He also asked other questions that were very important, for example ah, he talked about the fact that it was very important for us to realize that the White supremacists, just like the terrorists who flew their planes into the uhm, ah, ah, World Trade Center, did not see themselves as terrorists. In fact they saw themselves as patriots in terms of what they were doing. So that he gave this rousing uhm, uhm, ah, speech to the entire audience and he was greeted by a unanimous applause because we all left that ah, keynote address by saying we are better than that. We are better than these skinheads. As I left I began to experience some degree of ambivalence. I should be feeling good, because indeed the message was uplifting, but at the same time I began to worry that many of those who attended, the thousands who heard uhm, ah, Morris Dees' talk, tended to believe that the extreme acts of racism that indeed they were not racists and bias in themselves. And this is a question that we're going to return to and talk about very shortly. Finding number three is this that the face of racism has changed significantly. The old fashioned form was generally overt, direct and oftentimes intentional, if stress, it stressed strongly the inferiority of most racial ethnic minority groups and continues to be highly visible in hate crimes. Now while this overt acts of racism, injure, frighten, and kill innocent people they are perhaps less damaging believe it or not uhm, to people of color than what we label modern and contemporary forms of racism. Whether some of the characteristics of modern ah, of racism, first of all it is often subtle, indirect and unintentional. It is unconscious and it is outside our level of awareness. Secondarily, while there is an underlying belief in the inferiority of minorities, it is most strongly expressed in the belief in the superiority of whites. Third, racism becomes more frequent and intense as persons of color move up the status hierarchy. In other words, it is most likely expressed against high status individuals because they violate the normative structures of society and provoke anger and jealousy. Fourth, racism is most likely to be strongly directed toward those who challenge the system and ask for change. This ah, interestingly enough is not just simply limited to people of color, White allies who do the very, ah, ah, same thing or likely to be ah, ah, subjected to a great deal of ah, hostility from those in ah, ah, in our society. Ah, fifth, it is most likely to be expressed in a failure to help rather than in a con, conscious desire to hurt and I would soon talk about the study that indicates this very strongly. And sixth, discrimination is most likely to emerge not when that behavior would look prejudicial, but when other rationales can be presented for prejudicial behavior and when we as attempt or pretend not to notice differences. Seventh, in general what I am saying is that the contemporary forms of racism is many times over more problematic, damaging and interest to persons of color than the overt, racist acts that I have talked about. Indeed the latter acts represent very minimal threat to the quality of life of most racial ethnic minorities. Granted I wouldn't like to meet a White supremacist on a dark street at night but in essence that individual has less effect upon the quality of my life than ah, other individuals. Time does not permit me to briefly mention the voluminous amount of research which supports this contention. Thus, I will select only a few studies and some personal anecdotes I think to illustrate my main thesis. Several years ago, well maybe more than several years ago, there was a highly popular TV program called Candid Camera. Ah, what Candid Camera did was to have a hidden camera to tape individuals in unsuspecting situations and they would present very ah, ah, unrealistic situations and then videotape the reactions of individuals. For example in one ah, ah, a sequence film that I remember what they did was to take an engine out of a car and push a woman, a woman driver, ah, down the slope so that it appears that the car went into the service station in which the woman ah, I would, would stop the car in terms of the, a gas pump. As the attendants came out, ah, the woman would ah, asked the have the gas tank filled and would the individual check the ah, ah, check the oil. When the attendant opened the ah, ah, hood of the car, ah, he shouted out "Lady you don't have an engine!" The lady of course, the woman driver of course ah, assumed that well I, "What do you mean I don't have an engine?" and this was hilarious in terms of the taping. Now they did a similar Candid Camera study on housewives, ah, unbeknownst to the housewives, ah, a series of investigators went in to interview them ah, about ah, their attitudes towards ah, ah, towards Black youngsters, white youngsters and Latino youngsters. Ah, and this was done weeks before the actual study occurred. It was under the guise of, of trying to find out ah, attitudes towards ah, of ah, young teenagers. Unbeknownst to the subjects who were interviewed, what happened was that they grouped these people into different categories of those who said that, ah, that are, were most likely to be sincere in their ah, statements, that they harbored no racial animosity towards ah, Black youngsters and ah, towards ah Latino youngsters, no more than White youngsters. Unbeknownst to them as they came out of their home to go uhm, a grocery shopping, there was a hidden camera who taped them and they were subjected to a number of different situations but one of them uhm, ah, dealt with having either a Black, Latino or White youngster dressed identically in Levi's ah, an open-collar ah, ah, shirt, walked down the streen to, a street towards them as they were going to the grocery store. Now an, and, and the youngsters were generally asked to always pass the woman on the purse side of their ah, ah, body for example, if the woman was carrying a purse on the right ah, hand, or ah, strapped over the ah, right side, the youngsters were, ah, are told to always pass on that ah, side. If it was on the left side, they would pass the ah, ah, the woman on the left side. Now about 15 or 20 feet before it became obvious to the woman as she was walking to the store that the youngster was going to pass them, they videotaped the sequence of actions that, that would occur. What they found was that when the youngster was most likely either African-American or Latino, remember they were all dressed identically, as they approach 20 feet away from the woman, there would be a casual switching of the purse from one's arm to the other arm. If it was a white youngster who passed, no se-, there were occasional, uhm, ah, passing of the purse but in essence, significantly higher passing of the purse, uhm, ah, when the youngster was an individual of color. Now, these women were brought back together again to talk about the results of the finding. And what they discovered was something, uhm, uhm, a very interesting, uhm, those individuals who were adamant in saying that they harbored no stereotypes, fears or prejudices towards minority youngsters, who were shown the purse passing, tended to have three separate reactions. One group completely denied that they passed the purse on the basis, uhm, ah, of, of racial fears or stereotypes. Even when the, ah, film was in fast motion where the, there was always a passing occurred when the, ah, youngster was of color. There was another group who is severely disturbed by watching themselves on videotape, and a third group who entertained the possibility that indeed, they maybe harboring unconscious stereotypes. Now, what this study tends to indicate is that these were not mean, evil women. These were individuals who consciously, through a screening did believe that they harbored no fears and stereotypes of youngsters of color. But indeed, their nonverbals and the unconscious behavior indicated that they harbored many of these, uhm, ah, fears and biases. Another study that indicates insidious nature of bias, uhm, and how it affects our, our behavior was a study, ah, conducted by, uhm, a psychologist, Jack Dovidio, ah, in his studies of unintentional, unconscious, uhm, and modern forms of racism. What he did was set up a series of conditions in which it was, uhm, ah, during the rush hour, there was a car that was obviously disabled because a car hood was up, steam was coming, ah, out of it, uhm, and Dovidio did just two things, two conditions. One was that the, the disabled car belonged to an African American driver or a white driver. What he found was this, that when it was a white driver who was obviously involved in a disabled car, approximately 70 percent or greater of the passerby's, who saw the incident, offered help. When it was an African American driver, who was disabled, the help would not be offered. Indeed, what the video concluded from the study was that if this was a life-threatening issue, what would happen is that the Black driver would be twice as likely to die as the white driver. And the other thing he, uhm, ah, concluded, uhh, ah, was this, that many of the individuals that he stopped later to ask about didn't you see the disabled car with a Black driver, would give lots of excuses and rationale. I was late for work. I thought someone else would call. Now, remember, these may be legitimate reasons but then why was there a difference between the number of helping responses if the, ah, driver was white? And I think again, it gets to the fact of, uhm, the insidious nature of, of racism and the unintentional, uhm, ah, fact involved in it. There are other studies that, let me briefly share with you to indicate this, ah, research subjects tend to respond in a more hostile manner in, when they are, uhm, ah, ah, presented in a frustrating situation if they have been primed by subliminally shown pictures of an African American face as opposed to the face of a white individual. In other words, if you, uhm, subliminally present a picture of a Black face or a white face outside the conscious awareness of the individual, place them in a, a frustrating situation, they are more likely to act in a hostile manner if the face is that of Black person. White Americans tend to react physiologically when touched by an African American experimenter but not when touched by a White experimenter. People are more quick to link the word "White" with positive words such as smart, ah, ambitious, clean, and the word "Black" with negative words such as lazy, stupid, ah, and warfare(ph). And finally, studies reveal that white job applicants with identical credentials as their non-white counterparts are treated more favorably and extended job offers more frequently than those of people of color. Now, what are the consequences? All of these studies indicate that people who are well intentioned do harbor unconscious bias and discriminate in terms of differential behavior. What are the consequences of unintentional and unconscious racism? One of them is pathologizing the lifestyles, cultural differences of minority groups. We know, for example, that the poverty rate of African-Americans is three times that of white Americans that they are more likely to, ah, uhm, get or obtain inferior health care that they live five to year, seven years shorter that their white counterparts. The American Indian population, we know, has been decimated by wars, diseases that resulted from contact with Europeans. Good intentions like Reagan to civilize the Indians resulted in their last, loss of languages, disruption of cultural traditions, forced from their home onto reservations. Hispanic Americans are over represented among the poor, have high unemployment rates, substandard housing, suffer from health, uhm, ah, problems and inferior healthcare. Asian Americans have a higher prevalence of poverty despite the higher median income. This goes directly against the stereotype we have of Asian Americans. They are less likely to be promoted to upper management and executive positions, uhm, than, and are, even though more qualified than their White counterparts. In the name of eradicating racism, the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was passed and the incarceration of Japanese Americans was justified on National Security issues but, and also to protect the Japanese Americans. Now, all of these occur from what I call the insidious forms of racism. And I will end by asking you another, uhm, aspect, what is wrong with the following picture? While White Euro-American males constitute only 33 percent of the population, they occupy 80 percent of tenured positions in higher education. Eighty percent of the House of Representatives over the last few years, between 80 to 90 percent of the U.S. Senate, they are 92 percent of Forbes 400 Executive C.E.O. level positions. They are 90 percent of School Superintendents. They are 99.9 percent of athletic team owners, and they are 100 percent of U.S. presidents. What is glaring about this, can be asked in two questions. Where are the women? And where are the persons of color? It isn't White supremacist who create and control the tools that result in such unjust and damaging consequences. It is people we elect to office, teachers who educate our children, business leaders who carry out the policies and practices of our corporations, government leaders, law enforcement officers, physicians, dentists, construction workers, our family, friends and neighbors, it is you and I. And this leads me, indeed, to the second myth. Myth number two goes like this. It is the overt White supremacist, which poses the greatest hazard to persons of color. The truth that, is that these statistics and findings are only the tip of the iceberg. The results are not due to the overt racist but to well-intentioned, educated, moral, decent, justel, justice loving church goers, well-intentional people like you and me. Racism is indeed, deeply embedded on the individual, institutional and societal levels. It really acts as an invisible veil making it difficult for well meaning White individuals to see how their institutions discriminate. On an individual level, white people tend to experience themselves as moral, decent and fair-minded. And indeed, I believe that. They have strong egalitarian values and they believe that they are non-prejudiced. Thus, they find it difficult to acknowledge or entertain the notion that their actions or belief systems are prejudicial and discriminatory. Because they are generally well-intentioned, they cannot consciously acknowledge their own racism. And on an institutional level, I believe that the policies, practices, and structures of our organizations have inherent bias that works against people of color. This leaves me to the final myth, myth number three. And it goes like this. I don't condone nor practice discriminatory behavior. I'm not responsible for the actions of others, so, don't blame me. It is not enough to simply monitor our actions, to curtail our biases and prejudices. For example, do we actively intervene when we see injustice? Or do we sit idly by and rationalize away our inaction? Ah, these rationalizations, I've heard many times. They go something like this, "I'm only one person. What can I do? It's their problem, not mine. Saying something won't help the situation. If I say something, I'll lose friends and the support of family. I'm afraid to do anything because it may result in punitive actions toward me and bring attention to me." I want to read to you a quote from Albert Einstein that addresses this issue. Albert Einstein says this, "The world is too dangerous to live in, not because of the people who do evil, but because of the people who sit and let it happen." This is a quote from, ah, Pastor Martin Niemoller that I also would like to share with you. " In Germany, they first came for the Communist and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist. Then they came for Jews. And I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew. Then they came for the Trade Unionist. And I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Trade Unionist. They came for the Catholics. And I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me. And by that time, no one was left to speak up." I believe that each and every one of us must take the journey to multiculturalism. Ah, and those of us who have gone the path of multiculturalism have benefited in a number of ways that I would like to share with you. Uhm, the white folks, indeed, have said oftentimes that they have experienced a broadening of their horizons, increased their appreciation of people of all colors and cultures, become less afraid and intimidated by differences, then more able to openly communicate clearly with their family, friends and co-workers and experienced a spiritual connectedness with all groups. In closing, what I would like to say is this. I hope that each and every one of us take the journey of multiculturalism. I hope you will have the courage to continue the journey to racial, cultural awareness and that you will help others as well. I truly believe that our nation now stands at the crossroads of a major choice. One road is a path of monoculturalism. It is a road of business as usual. The other path offers hope for a fair, just and equitable society. It is truly the road less taken. It would be sad indeed, if we look back years from now only to echo the words of poet, John Greenleaf Whittier who say, stated, "For of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are these, it might have been." Thank you very much for listening and I hope you will join me in the future tapes on racism and antiracism.
