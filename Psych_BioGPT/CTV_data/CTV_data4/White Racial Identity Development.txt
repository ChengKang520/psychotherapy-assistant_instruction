00:00:00
DR. DERALD WING SUE  Welcome everyone. My name is Derald Wing Sue and this is part of the Lecture Series on "Counseling the Culturally Diverse: Theory and Practice." Today's presentation deals with a subject area that has exploded on the counseling mental health scene that deals with White racial identity development. If you have followed, ah, previous tapes in this series, you know that we spent considerable time talking about racial/ethnic minority identity development in terms of the importance of understanding the levels of consciousness of various people of color, various marginalized groups in order to be effective in delivering mental health services. One of the areas that we will talk about today is that because the majority of mental health practitioners continue to be primarily White-Euro Americans it is important that they begin to understand themselves as racial/cultural beings as well. I want you to, in some sense, if you have, had an opportunity to either have seen or to follow-up with another video tape, which is entitled: "What Does It Mean To Be White: The Invisible Whiteness Of Being." I encourage you to get hold of that tape and to view it as well because it really forms a basis of what we're going to be talking about, ah, ah, today. Why is it important for us to begin to understand White racial identity development? There are two primary reasons for why this is important. Ah, all of them relate to the essence of delivering effective mental health services to people of color or other marginalized groups in our society. One of them is that research has increasingly solved that the level of White consciousness that an individual has is correlated with issues of racism, racial bias and discrimination. Ah, one of the things that we will show is that as you begin to develop higher levels of white racial consciousness there is a lowering of the degree of bias bigotry and stereotyping likely to be manifested towards people of color. The other thing that is important for us to realize is that in almost all of the studies that are coming out women, White women tend to be at higher levels of consciousness regarding to their, ah, White racial, ah, being than White men are and as a result White women in some studies are shown to be less biased and, ah, bigoted or less prejudiced towards people of color. Another primary reason for why we will devote considerable attention to the area of White racial identity development is in essence the fact that cultural confidence has been shown to be correlated with the level of consciousness that a person has about their whiteness or their White identity. Now I am not going to go over all of the various, ah, ah, theorists and researchers who have contributed, ah, to this area but I will name a few individuals of importance that many of you might want to, ah, ah, pursue in terms of reading what their contributions have been. Janet Helms ah, William Cross, Rowe, Bennet, Atkinson, ah, Sue and Sue, Atkinson, Morten, & Sue and Ponterotto have developed White racial identity development theories, concepts and descriptions that may prove a benefit for many of us to begin to explore. In our work with trainees and clinicians what we have found is that it is very important for us to realize several things that deal with identity development that, ah, that is important in sense of how you work with individuals of color and I will concentrate primarily on individuals of color. There are essentially several racial identity assumptions that I want all of us to be aware of as we begin to talk about these phases of white identity. 

00:05:10
WHITE RACIAL IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT-Assumptions 1. Racism is a basic and integral part of U.S. life and permeates all aspects of our culture and institutions. 2. White Americans are socialized into U.S. society and, therefore, inherit the biases, stereotypes, and racist attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of the society. 

00:05:10
DR. DERALD WING SUE One of them is that we have to assume, ah, racism is a basic and integral part of U.S. life and permeates all aspects of culture and institutions. If you read the history of the United States it is inevitable that you conclude that it is the history of racial oppression. White Americans secondarily are socialized into U.S. society and, therefore, may inherit the biases, the stereotypes, the racist attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of that society. Again what I say is that none of us are immune from inheriting racial biases of our ancestors and forbears and it is this inheritance on, ah, unintentional, unconscious level that may lead to difficulties in our ability to understand ourselves as racial/cultural beings. The third- 

00:06:10
3. The level of White racial identity development in an interracial encounter affects the process and outcome of our relationships. 4. How Whites perceive themselves as racial beings seems to be strongly correlated with how they perceive and respond to racial stimuli. 

00:06:10
DR. DERALD WING SUE - major assumption is that the level of White racial identity development in an interracial encounter affects the process and outcome of such relationships. That is something that will become very clear when we begin to talk about the various phases or levels of white consciousness as people achieve them. The fourth one is that how Whites perceive themselves as racial beings seems to be strongly correlated with how they respond to racial stimuli. Consequently race related reality of Whites represents major differences depending upon their level of awareness and consciousness. The fifth assumption- 

00:07:05
5. It seems to follow an identifiable sequence. There is an assumption that White Americans who are born and raised in the United States, may move through levels of consciousness regarding their own identity as racial beings. 6. The most desirable development is not only the acceptance of whiteness, but also defining it in a nondefensive and nonracial manner. 

00:07:05
DR. DERALD WING SUE -is that racial identity development seems to follow a distinct identifiable sequence. Now I don't want to say it's linear but in terms of understanding the process of White identity, ah, development. It applies to each and everyone of, ah, people who are born and raised in the United States in terms of a process of socialization and cultural conditioning. The last one is that the most desirable development is not only the acceptance of whiteness, how you define your whiteness, but the importance of defining it in a nondefensive and nonracist, ah, manner. There are essentially seven phases, seven levels of consciousness that I will talk about today in an attempt to integrate all the various theories and models describing White racial identity, ah, development. I want you to view what I am going to talk about today as a process of developing white consciousness, ah, not so much that they are empirically based but a, ah, derivative of a descriptive process of white racial identity, ah, development. 

00:08:30
WHITE RACIAL IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT - Process Phase One - Naiveté Early childhood marked by naïve curiosity about race. Tendency to be innocent, open, and spontaneous regarding racial differences. May notice differences, but awareness of social meaning are absent or minimal. 

00:08:30
DR. DERALD WING SUE Phase one is what we call Naiveté. In early childhood, this is marked by naïve curiosity about race and generally this happens, uhm, ah, from the moment that one is born to about three years of age. There is a tendency for individuals ah, at the Naiveté phase to be innocent, open and spontaneous to racial differences. In the textbook "Counseling the Culturally Diverse," I gave you an example of watching a Vietnamese customer in a market, ah, ah, in, in the marketplace shopping and this small young child, White child, with the mother, ah, ah, exclaimed loudly, "Look at that man with the funny, ah, eyes!" The mother was terribly embarrassed and tried to hush the child up but it was clear that, uhm, the child noticed physical differences but was innocent and did not attribute positive or negative differences, which the mother may eventually or our society may, ah, ah, you know, eventually, ah, condition. The tendency is to notice differences but to be unaware of their social meanings. The social meanings associated with physical racial, ah, differences or absent. Now studies tend to indicate that around from three to five years of age is when a young child begins to be aware of, of physical racial, ethnic differences and that is when they begin to associate or impute meaning to the, ah, ah, to these differences. Let me read to you, uhm, this socialization process that propels people into what we call the Conformity phase, which is the second phase we'll shortly talk about. But let me read to you how children begin to become culturally diff, ah, ah, conditioned and socialized into attributing positive and negative qualities to difference. Ah, let me read to you, ah, ah, what one observer said. "It was a late summer afternoon. A group of White neighborhood mothers obviously friends, have brought their four and five year olds to the local McDonalds for a snack and to play on the swings and slides provided by the restaurant. They were all seated at a table watching their sons and daughters run about the play area. In one corner of the yard sat a small black child pushing a red truck along the grass. One of the White girls from the group approached the black boy and they started a conversation. During that instant the mother of the girl exchanged quick glances with their, ah, with other mothers who nodded knowingly. She quickly rose from the table walked over to the two spoke to the daughter and gently pulled her away to join her previous playmates. Within minutes however, the girl again approached the black boy and both began to play with the truck once again. At that point, all the mothers rose from the table and loudly explained to their children that, "it's time to go now." What I am saying, ah, by this particular example is that an insidious invisible process of socialization is occurring here. The mothers do not have to, in any way, verbally say that they do not want the child to play with someone of another race but by virtue of nonverbals, children are taught that some groups are more desirable than others, some we associate with, others we don't associate with. And this is primarily the process that is important for us to begin to understand that the process that White individuals are, are exposed to, are processes of education, processes of the mass medias, significant others that communicate racial biases to people. And as a result they enter into what we call the Conformity- 

00:13:15
Phase Two - Conformity Characteristics of naiveté may be maintained. Minimal awareness of self as a racial/cultural being. Strong belief in the universality of values and norms governing behavior. 

00:13:15
DR. DERALD WING SUE - phase of development. The characteristics of naiveté in the conformity stage can be maintained at some degree. There is still a minimal awareness of oneself as a racial/cultural being. The conformity phase of development is, ah, in, it's characterized by a strong belief in the universality of values and norms governing behavior. They are unlikely at that stage to recognize the polarities of the democratic principles of equality and the unequal treatment of racial/ethnic minority groups. At the conformity phase of development the most characteristic defense mechanism is compartmentalization and denial. Compartmentalization of contradictory attitudes, beliefs and behaviors, a person can believe that people are people but at the same time treat minorities differently. Because of this encapsulation it is possible for two diametrically opposed beliefs systems to coexist in the person's mind. Ah, and uncritical acceptance of White supremacy notions which relegates minorities into the inferior category with all racial stereotypes, that's one belief that is unconsciously existing in the mindset of the individual at the conformity level of consciousness. and the contradictory belief that racial and cultural differences are considered unimportant. This is really quite contradictory, because believing that racial differences are unimportant, at uhm, this Level of Consciousness allows White individuals to avoid perceiving themselves as dominant group members and, or having biases against various racial uhm, ethnic groups. As I've mentioned previously the conformity phase is most characterized by encapsulation and denial, denial that people are different, denial that discrimination exist and denial of their own prejudices. Instead, a locust of problems seemed to be attributed and to reside in the groups themselves, rather in uhm, ah, in the self. In her own racial awakening, Peggy McIntosh writes about something that occurred to her at the conformity level of consciousness. Let me read to you what she said. "My schooling gave me no training in seeing myself as an oppressor, as an unfairly advantage person or as a participant in a damaged culture. I was taught to see myself as an individual whose moral state depended on her individual moral will. Whites are taught to think of their lives as morally neutral, normative and average and also ideal. So when we work to benefit others, this is seen as work which will allow them to be more like us." And I wanted to stress that very strongly because most White Americans tend to be at the Naïveté Level of Consciousness, where they believe in the universality of norms, values and that Whiteness tends to represent a default standard. While the Naiveté Stage, face uhm, ah, one that we talked about, is brief in duration. That is, that it ends between the thir, third and fourth year. The conformity Phase of Development can last a lifetime. And this is really quite important for us to begin to look at. 

00:17:40
Phase Three- Dissonance Obliviousness breaks down when Whites become aware of inconsistencies. 

00:17:40
DR. DERALD WING SUE The Third Phase or Phase Three, represents what I describe as the Dissonance Phase of Development. Ah, this is where obliviousness and racial differences that they don't exist begin to break down. And many White Americans begin to notice and see inconsistencies, not only in themselves but throughout society as well. They become conflicted over irresolvable moral dilemmas that are frequently perceived as what I call Polar Opposites. They are believing that they are non-racist yet when their son or daughter becomes involved in an interracial relationship, they tend to not want it to occur. Ah, and we, we frequently have that, ah, going on, where I hear many White brothers and sisters will say something. "I don't have anything against interracial marriage or interracial relationships but I worry about the children. In essence, what is happening now, is that while they are on an Intellectual level to not object to it, on a much more personal, close level is when they have to confront the basic discrepancies that exist, uhm, ah, within them. They can also believe, in some sense, that men, all men are created equal yet they see society treating people of color as second class citizens. That is in essence, another major Dissonance, incongruity, inconsistency that they begin to acknowledge or witness in going on. Ah, they also begin to acknowledge that oppression and racism exist. Many White Americans who thought that, uhm, for example, that African- Americans where being treated well in our society and have come a long way, turned on the television set years ago, to watch Rodney King beaten by White police officers, and this strongly indicated to them that we do not live in a society of equality. Again that sort, this strikes at the core of their belief that all people are created equal or that racism has diminished considerably, become the person on the Dissonance Stage, becomes increasingly conscious of Whiteness and experiences inconsistencies or feelings of guilt, depression, ho, helplessness and indeed anxiety. Dissonance creates strong feelings ah, that are uncomfortable for the White person to experience and what happens is that they feel almost pushed to go back to the Stage of, uhm, ah, Conformance. They don't want to cans, ah, confront the inconsistencies that they feel and engage in, because it says something about that, them that is quite disturbing and frightening. Movement into the Dissonance Stage occurs when ah, ah, Whites are forced to deal with these inconsistencies that have been compartmentalized ah, or they encounter experiences and feelings that are odds with their ah, denial. Dissonance often find, uhm, makes White Americans feel guilty, shameful, angry and depressed. They can witness discrimination going on and do nothing about it and feel very guilty in some sense they should be doing something about it. They tend to operate under rationalizations that uhm, excuse them in one way or another. Rationalizations may become the manner used to exonerate their inactivity in ah, combating what they perceive as injustices that are going on. Some of the statement that I've heard from people at this phase or Level of Development tend to be "I'm only one person. What can I do about it?" or " Everyone is prejudice, even minorities." These statements are rationalizations that allow a White person to not have to do anything about it and, decreases the amount of uhm, ah, guilt, ah, the amount of anxiety that they may, uhm, ah, experience. As these conflicts become greater, however, Whites may choose to do several things. Some tend to retreat into the protective confines of White culture, and will move back to the previous stage that I uhm, mentioned before, of conformance. After all, it's easier not to think about these unpleasant things, and just go along to get along. So people may, in essence attempt to move back to the conformance, uhm, ah, Phase of Development, or they can choose a much more courageous approach. And that is to progressively move towards insight and revelation. Insight and revelation tends to propel the individual into the Resistance and Immersion of, of Phase of Development. Let me read to you some of the uhm, ah, aspects of the Dissonance Stage that people go through on ah, ah, experiential level. This is again taken from ah, a passage written by a White counseling Psychologist, Mark Kiselica, " I was deeply troubled as I witnessed on a daily basis the detrimental effects of institutional racism and oppression on ethnic minority groups in this country. The latter encounters forced me to recognize my privileged position in our society because of my status as a so-called Anglo. It was upsetting to know that I, as member of White society benefitted from the hardships of others that were caused by a racist system. I was also disturbed by the painful realization that I was, in some ways, a racist. I had to come, I had to come to grips of the fact that I had told and laughed at racist jokes, and through such behavior had supported White racist attitudes. If I really wanted to become an effective multi-cultural psychologist, extended and profound self-reckoning was in order. At times, I wanted to flee from this unpleasant process, by merely participating superficially with the reaming task while avoiding any substantive self evaluation." This is so characteristic of an individual at the Dissonance Phase of Development. The self recognace, uhm, the, the self-reckoning, the, the struggle, the dealing with painful feelings that makes a person ah, uncomfortable. And in this struggle, like what I was saying, that people either begin to let go of it and move back into a priver, ah, ah, a prior ah, Level of Development or they decide to have the courage to journey to what I call ah, ah, Phase Four, which is... 

00:25:50
Phase Four - Resistance and Immersion Whites begin to question and challenge their racism. For the first time, they begin to realize what racism is all about, and their eyes are suddenly opened. Racism becomes noticeable in all facets of their daily lives (advertising, television, educational materials, interpersonal interactions, etc.) 

00:25:50
DR. DERALD WING SUE the Resistance and Immersion Stage of ah, Development for ah, ah, White individuals. At the Resistance and Immersions Phase of Development, the White individual begins to question and challenge their own racism. For the first time they began to realize what racism is all about and their eyes are suddenly opened. In the racial, cultural lab that we use here at, ah, Teachers College, one of the things that happens in the, we begin to ah, it's a semester 14 uhm, ah, 15 week, ah, ah, course. What happens is that many White students find middle, mid way through the course, begin to truly understand racism. There eyes are opened. They turn on the television set and they will see commercials, uhm, discrepancies that begin to remind them of how racism begins to operate. 

00:26:55
WHITE RACIAL IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT- Process Phase Four - Resistance and Immersion Whites begin to question and challenge their racism. For the first time, they begin to realize what racism is all about, and their eyes are suddenly opened. Racism becomes noticeable in all facets of their daily lives (advertising, television, educational materials, interpersonal interactions, etc.). 

00:26:55
DR. DERALD WING SUE Racism become very noticeable to individuals at the Resistance and Immersion Stage in all facets of their daily lives. In advertising, television, educational materials, interpersonal interactions and so on. A major questioning of their own racism and that of others marks the Stage of Development. In addition, there's increased awareness of how racism operates and its pervasiveness in U.S. culture and institutions. These are the hallmark of these Level of Consciousness ah, Development. The person who begins to move into the Resistance and Immersion Stage is likely to experience strong feelings of betrayal, anger and resentment. There's likely to be angry at a family and friends and institutions and larger society for having sold them a false bill of goods. That is democratic ideals versus what reality actually says and, ah, and, and the fact that this isn't really a, a practice, so that there is anger, a sense of betrayal and, ah frustration that they have been ah, ah, ah, you know, in some sense sold this false bill of goods that has presented them from actually seeing what has been occurring uhm, in, in our society. There is likely at this Phase of Development to be a high sense of guilt, when racism is pushed into the awareness or mind, are people with the Resistance and Immersion Stage, you are likely to experience feelings of guilt. Now Joe Ponterotto, a White counseling psychologist at Fordham University has talked about what he calls ah, "Characteristic of ah, this Phase of Development." Ah, what we call the "White Liberal Syndrome." The White Liberal Syndrome, tends to be motivated by intense feelings of guilt that "I should be doing something" or "I shouldn't have done something in the past when it occurs." This White Liberal Syndrome is manifested according to Ponterotto in two complimentary styles. The first one is what he calls the prote, "The Protector (ph) of Paternalistic Role." This is a role the people, White individuals tend to actively, try to stand up in uhm, ah, for people of color, but they do it out of guilt and they do it for Paternalistic reasons that offends people of color. Ah, and this is something that I really want you to begin to understand, that people of color do not appreciate a paternalistic ah, approach that is based upon guilt. It is far different from a person who actively intervenes like we will talk about if the ah, anti racist ah, ah commitment phase of development, the seventh ah, level where the person is not motivated by guilt but motivated to do the right thing because of their ah, understanding of what their whiteness means to them. The other attempt that uhm, is ah, is a of, is, is ah, part of the protect, ah, part of the ah, ah, of the White Liberal Syndrome is what we call oder, over identification with the minority group. At the University of California-Berkley years ago, my first position there in working with ethnic studies especially Asian American studies when the Third World movement was so strong. Ah, in terms of, of, ah black power, yellow power, red power ah, brown power, all of these movements, we did have white students as allies but some of the white students were uhm, really motivated by what we, I call guilt and that guilt con, contributed to their attempt to over identify with uhm, ah with the group that they ah, ah were trying to work with. For example, I sensed that the were White students who actively and truly wanted to be Asian ah, but it was more a rejection and a running away from their whiteness in terms of these ah, movement and again what I'm saying is that both the paternalistic, protector role and the over identification with a minority group are not helpful to people of color because it still indicates a White person has not adequately dealt with what it means to be White in their own whiteness. They have not defined their whiteness in a non-racist manner that is part of future levels of development that we will uhm, ah, begin to talk about uhm, very shortly. The resistance immersion stage is characterized by dilemmas that the individual again faces to move back to the conformity stage ah, the dissonance stage or some place in order to deal with the discomfort that maybe going on. The discomfort in realizing that they are White and that their group has engaged in oppression of racial ethnic minorities may propel them to the next stage of development. Uhm, let me read to you uhm, a White psychologist, Sara Winter's description of this stage in a very personal way when she begins to confront her uhm, ah thoughts and relationships with Black Americans or African Americans. "Let me explain this healing process in more detail. We must unearth all the words and memories we generally try not to think about, but which are inside all of us all the time: "nigger," " Uncle Tom," "Jungle Bunny," "Oreo:, Lynching, cattle prods, castrations, rapist, black pussy, black men with their huge penises and hundreds more. I shudder as I write. We need to review three different kinds of materials. One, all our personal memories connected with blackness and Black people including everything we can recall, hearing or reading. Two, all the racist images and stereotypes that we've ever heard particularly the grossest and most hurtful ones. Three, any race related things we ourselves said, did or omitted which we feel bad about today. Most Whites begin with the good deal of amnesia. Eventually the memories crowd in, especially when several people pool their recollections together. Emotional release is a vital part of the process. Experiencing feelings seems to allow further recollections to come. I need persistent encouragement from my companions to continue." This is really, this last statement, I need persistent encouragement from companions to a, a to continue is indeed true because when your mindset becomes liberated, when you see what is actually going on in our society, you begin to lose a lot of your family, friends because they do not understand your world view and there will be strong, powerful forces that will ask you to move back to a prior level of consciousness so that you can maintain those relationships and those groups that you've always had as you journeyed along the way. Now if you begin to move in that of, ah particular direction... 

00:35:35
WHITE RACIAL IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT - Process 

00:35:35
DR. DERALD WING SUE  We enter phase five which is what I call the introspection stage. This phase is most likely a compromise of swinging from extreme unconditional acceptance of White identity to a rejection of whiteness. It represents almost a compromise between the conformity level of consciousness and the resistance and immersion level of consciousness where you're swinging from one and to the other. This stage ah, or phase of development, the introspection phase is a state of relative quiescence, introspection and reformulation of what it means to be White. There is a realization ah, and ah, you realize and no longer deny that you have participated in oppression, that you have benefited from White privilege and that racism is an entrical part of U.S. society and culture. You become less motivated by guilt and defensiveness. You accept your whiteness and you seek to define your own identity and that of, uhm, ah your own racial, cultural group. In the introspection stage, you begin to ask yourselves serious questions. These questions tend to be what does it mean to be White? I have always found that when I ask that questions to many of my White colleagues, many White students, they are baffled and that is real, one of the reasons why I, ah, if you get an opportunity to get hold of the tape on the invisible whiteness being, what does mean to be white, where I share with the ah, all of you uhm, ah, excerpts that we took from narratives of people that we would interview. People are confused, baffled or they are very uncomfortable with the question and that discomfort really hinders an ability to begin to ask yourself, what does it mean uhm, ah, to be White? A second question is, who are you in relationship to your whiteness, and thirdly, who are you as a racial cultural being? You cannot allow other individuals to define your whiteness for you. You have to take an active hand just like people of color have done in an attempt to not allow society to define whiteness and that movement in the definition of what your whiteness means must be defined on a non-defensive, non-racist ah, ah, ah, manner. Feelings or affective elements that you experience at this stage can be very existential in nature and their maybe feelings of lack of connectedness, isolation and confusion and lost because you are now on the borders of losing one means of self-identity and developing a new identity that is going on. Ah, at phase five, at the introspection ah, phase of development, you begin to ask the painful questions of who you are in relationship to your racial heritage and honestly confronting your biases and prejudices and accepting responsibility for your whiteness is a culminating, is a culminating aspect of this level consciousness. You will begin to develop new ways of defining your White Euro-American social group and your membership in that group becomes important. You no longer now begin to deny being White and you honestly confront racism, understand the concept of White privilege and feel increased comfort in your relationship with people of color. These are really the two very important elements that you begin to understand how your whiteness have advantaged you in this society. What white privilege means and like, and, and secondarily you begin to develop greater alliances and comfort in working and relating to people of, of color. Now uhm, if you begin to do that, you enter into what we call... 

00:40:25
WHITE RACIAL IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT - Process Phase Six. 

00:40:25
DR. DERALD WING SUE ...the next to the last phase, the, the phase of integrative ah, awareness. Reaching this level of development is most characterized by the following, understanding your self as a racial/cultural being, awareness of sociopolitical influences with respect to racism, appreciation of racial cultural diversity not simply tolerance but appreciating and valuing of, ah diversity and racial diversity in particular and rooting out buried and nested racial fears and emotions. This is a process of integrative a, awareness. There is a formation at this point of a nonracist White Euro-American identity. Ah, this becomes ah, emerges and becomes internalized. You begin to value multi culturalism. There is comfort now in being around members of culturally different groups and you begin to develop a strong connectedness with all groups not just with White friends and peers ah, that you did in the past. There is now an inner sense of security and a strength to function in society that really is marginally accepting of integratively aware individuals. Now this is something I often talk to White brothers and sisters about. If you reach this level of awareness, you will encounter a society that does not accept you. You to, you know, to be integratively aware is to encounter all the forces in society that does not allow you to empathize and to see the world realistically in terms of race and racism and there are strong forces that will try to move you back uhm, ah, to that area. The integrative awareness stage ah, is different from the previous one in two main ways. It is marked by a shift in focus when trying to change people of color to changing the self and to changing other White people. It is also secondarily marked with increasing experiential and affective understanding that was lacking in the previous stage. Now successful resolution of the integrative awareness phase requires an emotional catharsis or release that forces you to relive or reexperience previous emotions that were denied and ah, ah distorted. The ability to achieve this affective experiential ah, upheaval leads to really almost a feeling of euphoria and indeed a rebo, birth because you, now, you begin to define a new non-racist uhm, of, ah, identity. Now let me read to you again ah, an excerpt that indicates the integrative awareness stage and what happens at this particular stage of, of development to give you an experiential understanding. "In this sense, we Whites, are the victims of racism. Our victimization is different from that of people of color but it is real. We have been programmed into the oppressor roles we play without our informed consent in the process. Our unawareness is part of the programming. None of us could tolerate the oppressor position if we live with the day-to-day emotional awareness of the pain inflicted on other human beings through the instruments of our behavior. We Whites benefit in concrete ways, year in and year out from the present racial arrangements. All my life in White neighborhoods, White schools, White jobs and dealing with White police to name only a few. I have experienced advantages that are systematically not available to people of color. It does not make sense for me to blame myself for the advantages that have come my way by virtue of my whiteness. But absolving myself from guilt does not imply forgetting about racial injustice or taking it lightly as my guilt will push me to do." What I am saying here is that it becomes very, very important for us to note that uhm, to develop this nonracist identity, ultimately is painful and requires considerable strength and courage in terms of how we develop that way. Let me now talk about the last phase of development. 

00:45:45
WHITE RACIAL IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT - Process Phase Seven - Commitment To Antiracial Action Most characterized by social action. There is likely to be a consequent change in behavior, and an increased commitment toward eradicating oppression as well. Seeing "wrong" and actively working to "right it" require moral fortitude and direct action. 

00:45:45
DR. DERALD WING SUE Phase seven, commitment to antiracist action. You know, one of the ah, someone once stated that the ultimate White privilege is the ability of Whites to acknowledge that privilege but do, do nothing about it. At the commitment to antiracist action, this is perhaps very difficult for many Whites to do because it requires social action. There is likely to be a consequent change in behavior and an increase commitment to eradicating oppression as well. Seeing "wrong" and actively working to "right it" require moral fortitude and direct action. Objecting to racist jokes. Trying to educate family, friends, neighbors and co-workers about racial issues. Taking direct action to eradicate racism in schools, workplace and in social policy is often in conflict with that of other White individuals and that is where you encounter difficulty. Becoming increasingly immunized to social pressures where a conformance become important because you have to be able to be quite ah, outstanding apart from all the forces that will try to move you back to going along in order to get along. In addition to family and friends uhm, you will begin to uhm, uhm, find that you need to form alliances with other persons of color and with liberated Whites as well. Because it is these individuals who understand your worldview and your development who will become almost a second family giving you validation, encouragement to continue the struggle against individual, institutional and societal racism. Let me read to you again sar, another Sara Winter's passage about commitment to antiracist action. "To end racism, Whites have to pay attention to it and continue to pay attention. Since avoidance is such a basic, dynamic of racism, paying attention will not happen naturally. We Whites must learn how to hold racism realities in our attention. We must learn to take responsibility for this process ourselves without waiting for people of color's actions to remind us that the problems exist and without the vet, pending on people of color to reassure us and forgive us for our racist sins. In my experience, the process is painful but it is a relief to shed these fears, stereotypes and the immobilizing guilt we didn't want in the first place." This is where I think it is very important as we come to the end this sub, ah, session, I'd like to summarize for you the, what I've been trying to communicate as the movement towards becoming ah, aware of a non-racism ah, developing and internalizing a non-racist White identity. There is nothing wrong in being White. But you have to be active in defining what your whiteness means to you in a non-racist and non-defensive ah, way. So that there are in essence...

WHITE RACIAL IDENTITY DEVELOPMENT - SUMMARY First, you must actively place yourself in new and oftentimes uncomfortable situations that impel you to question yourself as a racial/cultural being, and to increase awareness of racial issues, especially racism.

DR. DERALD WING SUE ...four major objectives that I talk to and tell my White brothers and sisters about. First, you must actively place yourself in new and oftentimes uncomfortable positions or situations that impel you to question your racial, cultural being and to increase awareness of racial issues, especially racism. Many of you, I would ask have you ever been as a White person in an all White ah, in an all ah, Asian group, an all Black group, an all Latino group? If you have, you will notice how uncomfortable it is but for you to begin to develop an understanding and to liberate yourself from these fears, you must put yourself in those situations. Second, change must occur in the formation of new insights, attitudes and behaviors that lead to a realization of your role in the perpetua, ah, perpetuation of racism. You need to begin to understand how you have contributed to the racism problem and to begin to do something about it. Thirdly, I think that considerable and continuing energies must be devoted to the maintenance of a healthy White racial identity. In other words, change is not enough in the phase of societal pressures or forces that serve to squelch or punish descent on your part. As a liberated White individual who is an ally of multiculturalism and diversity, who is an ally of social justice, you will come under great pressures uhm, that work against your ability to move in that particular direction. And lastly, I stress this again that you have to become an ally to take action in the eradication of racism. Passively understanding it, acknowledging it is not enough. By not doing anything in essence, means that you have conspired to allow injustice to continue to operate in our society. Thank you very much uhm, ah, for listening today.
