TANYA CURTIS So Matthew from earlier this morning sort of preempted this talk a little bit right at the end when he started to talk about the relationship between the practitioner and the client and how that is actually of the most benefit not depend, uh, not specifically on the therapy that you're doing. But a lot of what I'm going to be talking about today is as the title suggests. It's highlighting that we are in fact the same as our clients. We are the same in that we are all different but what this workshop is going to be about is suggesting that a lot of what we're supporting our clients to go through in supporting them to be able to deal with their, their issues and the things that are going on for them is also a process that we can go through. So I have a premise that unless we have dealt with the issue that the client is presenting with, we're actually unable to support the client with that same issue. So if our, let's say for example we've got maladaptive behaviors with eating and a client comes to us, to support us, to help them understand why they have maladaptive behaviors with eating, we're actually not truly going to be able to support them unless we've actually dealt with our own patterns in ourselves. So everything that I'm talking about is never about saying separating clinician from client but it's actually saying we are exactly the same as out client and if you are working with a client and they're a person that feels judged or if you're a person that feels judged, do you feel motivated to want to work with that person? Typically the answer would be no, we don't want to work with somebody who we're feeling judged by, so a lot of what we're looking at here is going well, how do we work with ourselves while working with clients and seeing them as an equal as us, so therefore as a result they're not feeling judged, they feel equal to us in the way that they present the world. But before I go into the specific details of all of that, I work, my clinic is Fabic and I'm probably the luckiest out of all of us in location because I'm actually two minutes down the road here, so I've had the least amount of travel out of everybody. But Fabic is a behavioral specialist center and we support people to understand and change unwanted behavior and that phrase goes from as I call it short people to tall people. So I work with people who are, last week I had a client come in that was 22 months of age and then my following client after that was a person who was 78 years of age. And so we work across the span with all people who are using a behavior that they would prefer not to be using, and if I ask you all to be honest, who of you are using a behavior you'd prefer not to be using? Is it all of us? And one of the issues that we have with changing behavior is that a lot of society focuses just on changing behavior, whereas if you see a lot of our logo says it's actually about understanding and then changing behavior so it's really important to not focus on changing behavior without actually understanding why the behavior is happening. So everything that we're doing with our clients is understanding that all behavior is happening for a reason and for me, it's never, ever about judging behavior and as my clients always sit down, I'm saying to them, look I don't care what behaviors you're going to tell me you're using because I know those behaviors are not you. Those behaviors are just the coping mechanisms that you have to cope with life and life in a way that you don't feel totally equipped to manage. So one of the things that we're doing is connecting with people for who they are first and not judging or identifying by their behaviors and the way that I connect with a person is knowing that we're all the same in that at the core of all of us we're all awesome, amazing, lovable beings. And that's how we're all the same. Nobody is different, however we're not always using amazing behaviors but we are always, no matter what behaviors we're using, we're always amazing. And I've worked with some people with very high intensity unwanted behaviors who throughout life have been judged quite severely for their behaviors and as a result along the trail, everybody's forgotten who they are and they've forgotten to connect with this person and this person or this being at the core of them is always an awesome, amazing, lovable being. So no matter who walks through my door, they're generally the first words that they're getting from me, is that you're amazing just for being you, not for what you do, not for who you are, not for what you don't do, but you're amazing just for being you. And if I take that concept and just extend it a little bit further, what we're starting to support people to understand is that behavior is not who you are, it's what you do. So there's the core being as I highlighted before the awesome amazing lovable being but then there's your behaviors, and those behaviors are extremely, it's extremely if a persons starts to become identified by those behaviors and whether those behaviors that a person's becoming identified by are unwanted behaviors, which I'll typically call thumbs down behaviors if I'm working with short people, or wanted behaviors, or thumbs up behaviors, either of those are equally harming to become identified by. So for example, this chant first came about when one of my first clients who's kind of, anyway, this first client came into my office. He was a five year old boy and previously I had already met with his parents and this boy was using a lot of aggressive and unwanted behaviors and he was identified by a lot of people as being naughty, as being bad, as being all of those words that to me are just words but this boy when he came in, I said to him, so why are you coming to Fabic? and the reason why I ask that question is to get an understanding as to why they think they're coming to Fabic, what's previously been told to them. So this five year old boy said to me, he's coming to Fabic so I can stop him from being a bad person, and that same statement was reiterated to me this week when I was doing a social skills program and in the activities that were required to do is learning to give compliments and so this eight year old was giving compliments and he came to me to give me a compliment and he said, ah the thing I like about you is you stop me being bad. And what I brought back straight away is you're not bad. I said yes you use thumbs down behaviors but you're amazing, you're amazing just for being you and you're awesome and geez, you're lovable and yes you use some thumbs down behaviors but they're not you. But if we get people who become identified by being bad like that five year old or this eight year old, if they think they're bad, what are they going to be like when they're 15? What are they going to be like when they're 25? And as we carry on, what are they going to be like, oops, what are they going to be like for the rest of their life? Like for me, a theory would be how many people are in prison now using unwanted behaviors, yes they've used a group of behaviors that need to be, have consequences to them, but how many of those use those behaviors when way back at five, they've already identified themselves as being a bad person. So they become resigned to the fact that they're bad, not that they're awesome and they're amazing and they're lovable and yes, they use unwanted behaviors. It's, that's not even considered, it's not even part of their repertoire. But equally as harming is being identified by your thumbs up behaviors. For example, if I've got a person who's a straight A student at school and she becomes identified as being the straight A student at school, what happens if she gets a B plus? Her world falls apart. Or if you've got a mother who's identified by being a good mother and then their child has a tantrum in public, that mother just feels totally crushed because they now think they're being judged on their mothering skills rather than saying I'm amazing and yes I've got a child who's using unwanted behaviors right now but that's no judgment of me as a person. Or yes I'm an amazing person who got a B plus but if I got a D or if I got an A, I'm equally amazing. That shouldn't have an impact. But now look at it from a practitioner's point of view. Like first of all, how many of you can honestly say they feel amazing and they identify themselves as amazing, awesome, lovable beings? Like if that in any way makes you squirm on the inside, then there's a sense of saying well if that makes you squirm, is it possible that it's not even capable of you being able to teach that to your clients because if you're not living that for yourself, it's not possible to teach that to your clients. And if I've got to look at the pure fact of we've got to support our clients to connect with who they are themselves, we also need to learn how to connect with ourselves first. So we need to look at how can we become, not become because we already are amazing, but how can we start to feel and express that amazingness on a regular basis? Does that make sense? So everything that I'm teaching people is that no matter who you are, no matter what you do, at the core of each and every one of us is an awesome, amazing, lovable being and our behaviors are what we do but our behaviors are not who we are. We are amazing first and we are practitioners second. Our practitioner, but if we become identified by being a practitioner, how we feel about ourselves will become influenced by the results that we seem to get from our clients or the feedback that we get from our clients, and if a client walks away saying that's the worst session I've ever had or that's the worst therapist in the world, if you feel amazing just for being you, those comments will have no impact on who you are, and equally so, if you have a client walking away saying you saved my life, thank you so much, straight away you'll go, no I actually didn't save your life. I taught you the skills and you're the one that chose to do that for yourself. So the accolades that you receive will also have no impact on how you feel about yourself, so no matter what comments come back, they will not impact on how you feel about yourself because the outside world, the comments won't matter because you know how amazing you are for yourself. Does that make sense? But it's a foreign concept and it's not something that's typically taught. And how do we actually start to feel that amazingness on a regular basis. I'll give you some examples as we go through but a lot of, before we go onto that, I just want to talk about some different topics and the question that I've often asked is what motivates people to work in the field of mental health, and a lot of the times we go in with the I want to help people situation, which there is truth behind that for a lot of people, but and I'm not saying this for anybody in the group but I have seen this in the profession, a lot of people do go into the field as well because then they don't have to deal with their own stuff, because if you're working with somebody who has a higher intensity of issues than yourself, you look better than them and if you look better than them, you don't actually have to deal with your stuff. Does that make sense? So it is important to ponder for ourselves is what was the decision that we made to go into the field, and the decision is is it to support humanity? If that's a genuine call, that's great because that will then mean you are genuinely interested in supporting yourself as well, but if it's the I want to be better than, then it's great, we'll just work with people who have not achieved the same level of skills that we have but we don't, we kept ourselves from continuingly develop. So for me, working in this field has consistently taught me about everything we teach to our clients is something that we also need to be living for ourselves, so the three step process that I'll be going through and teaching you is a three step process that I live for myself, and as a result of doing that three step process, I'm consistently able to increase the level of clients that I'm able to support and the level of clients that I'm able to work with, and I can say that some of the intensity of the clients that are coming into Fabic a while ago I had the skills to be able to work with because I had addressed those issues within myself. However there were certain levels I'd kept myself to a certain point as well, and as a result other people were coming to me at the same level and they were also saying, well life could be a bit better than where it is right now and I'm going no, no, you're fine, you're okay, but that's just because I'd kept to myself, but now as I keep working on myself and my, my, the challenges that I've experienced are starting to disappear so the quality of my life is improving, that's increasing my ability to work with this gap, so the level of clients that I'm able to work with are now changing. But that comes from an approach and of always saying to my clients as I am no different than you. We are exactly the same. I still have issues, I still have challenges, I still have things in life that I need to develop the skills to work for and as I teach all of our clients, our number one job is to love ourselves. Our number one job is to continually work on ourselves, and whether it's working with a child or whether it's working with a parent or whether it's working with a psychiatrist who I was working with recently, all of us are equally, we need to put ourselves first, and if we put ourselves first, then we're able to support others. However it's a challenge or it challenges our beliefs in what is putting ourselves first, because a lot of people come into the helping field thinking we need to sacrifice ourself for others but if we sacrifice ourselves for others, we're in fact harming ourselves and by harming ourselves we're reducing our capacity to support other people so it is consistently important to say supporting ourselves is not selfish as the myth is often said, but supporting ourselves is in fact supporting our clients even further. And there's been times that I'll call in to work and say, guys I need to have the day off work today, not because I'm sick but because I'm not in the best state to be able to support the clients yet so then I have that time to be able to get myself back on track and then the quality that I give clients is enhanced even further. But if I go in and give a fifty percent job, they receive a fifty percent quality of me and that's not fair for the client themselves. So what I'm talking about here, is living what we teach, is if we're talking about teaching our clients self responsibility, it is important that we start living that 'cause if you've even been to let's say a doctor who smells of nicotine and you went into the room and they said oh should you give up, that you should give up smoking, or you saw them out the back having a cigarette before you went in for your appointment, would you listen to them? No, technically what they're saying is correct, yea, or if you've gone to a person who's overweight and they say you should go on a diet, technically they were correct, yea, however because they're not living it, it's just words that go over your head. So everything that I'm teaching at Fabic is all about teaching independence and responsibility and I know the only way to be able to support ourselves completely is through responsibility, but if we're not living responsibility, are our clients going to be able to develop the skills for responsibility 'cause if we preach it, it is just words, but if we live it, then it comes from a whole different level of quality that we'll support the client to develop. Any questions so far? Just get, Pedro's going to bring the microphone to you. Just the next table Pedro. 

00:18:40
UNKNOWN Tanya, my question is when I listen to what you're saying, it strikes me especially about for ourselves, about the difference between being and doing 

00:18:45
TANYA CURTIS Yes 

00:18:45
UNKNOWN Have I understood that correctly? 

00:18:45
UNKNOWN That is correct. 

00:18:50
UNKNOWN So giving ourselves time to be 

00:18:50
TANYA CURTIS Yes 

00:18:50
UNKNOWN And to assimilate or do what we need to do to get these habits, behaviors that we can then work with our clients better? 

00:19:00
TANYA CURTIS That's correct. Yes, whereas the doing is where we become identified by the behaviors, where the being is saying we're all equally amazing just for being us. 

00:19:10
UNKNOWN The other thing that, the other word, sorry don't mean to hold, but it comes to me about authenticity 

00:19:15
TANYA CURTIS Yes 

00:19:15
UNKNOWN It's about being authentic 

00:19:15
TANYA CURTIS Yes, it's about being you. That's right, and I've always said one of the biggest evils is comparison. Yea, and if we start comparing ourselves with each other, then straight away, comparison brings out a better than or lesser than as does competition, like competition is equally harming if used incorrectly because competition is always about who's better than the other, whereas as me, it's about anybody is better than the other. We're just us. Yea, and by being that, I can speak personally the amount that I do, the quality of what I do is just substantiated. It's just, it still blows me out of the water as to what can be achieved when you focus of just being, yea, so 'cause a lot of people can get lost in that and go, well that's aerie faerie, isn't it. How do you just be? And you've got to tick the boxes, you've got to achieve, you've got to do all of these things, but all I can say is, is to develop that process of what we will talk through now, about by learning to be what you do is just multiplied, yea, 'cause the quality and the quantity now in comparison to three years ago is just huge. Yea. So what does supporting ourselves really mean? And again, a phrase that I'm always using at Fabic, whether it's with clients, with my staff, with people who I'm training, but the only way to truly understand or support ourselves to deal with our stuff is to be honest without judgment and honesty without judgment is just essential. But if we work backwards from that statement, judgment stops people from being honest, and without honesty we can't identify what's really going on with us. So without identifying what's really going on, we can't truly get support. So the honesty without judgment is just essential because with the judgment, oh sorry, without the judgment with the honesty, it allows evolution and it allows us to consistently develop. So honesty without judgment is just essential and that again comes with living what we teach. So living what we teach is teaching our clients to be honest, teaching our clients to not judge themselves, not to judge others, but to support themselves to be able to identify what their concerns are. As I've already focused on the living what we teach is really meaning acknowledging that we are the same as our clients in that we are no different. We're all the same as our clients in that we all experience tensions in life and we all experience tensions in life that take our anxiety levels higher and all behavioral deterioration is a result of anxiety which I will explain to you again further. So seeking our own support is paramount and that's what a lot of people are not doing and one of the groups that I'll be starting on the Gold Coast soon is supporting people to understand that personal development is equally if not more important than professional development because there's a huge focus on the need for professional development and we've all got to be registered with organizations, need to tick our boxes and to get the right number of points and all of those things but personal development is really what will support us to continually increase our ability to support our clients. And that's where the honesty comes in because again if we go in with a well I'm better than, I don't have my issues, if we work with people who have a higher level of issues as what we have, then we stop ourselves from being honest ourselves. So everything that I teach is based on what I call the Fabic three step process, so it's a very simple process and I'll go through the steps and then I'm going to explain them in a lot more detail 'cause most of the presentation is on these three steps. But I've always said that our body is our biggest form of communication. A lot of people think that our head is communicating but in truth our body is our greatest form of communication and if I give you an example, have you all walked into a room and just sensed something that's not right? Your head can't make sense of that because on a visual appearance, on an auditory appearance, everything seems to be ticking the right boxes but there's a sense that something's not quite right, so your body has registered that something's going on for you. And more often than not, we ignore that. Yea, we override that and go, oh that doesn't make sense, but how many times has your body sensed something and later you go, yea I already knew that. Does that make sense, yea? So again supporting people to really be honest is first about supporting people to listen to their body and listen to their body in a way that is supporting them to tell them when a tension is presented, when a challenging situation is presented. So the first step that I'll teach my clients is to listen to your body, and that's either listen to your own body or if your working with somebody who doesn't have the capacity to cognitively become aware of their body, the carers listen or observe the body of another person. So mostly females in here. I'm going to imagine a lot of you are mothers, but how many of you have said as a mother, just mother's intuition, I knew that something was going to happen so we had to get out of there? Yea, it's not actually mother's intuition. You've actually observed that person's body and they've given you a communication signal to say my anxiety levels are increasing and I need help now. You may not have processed it that way, but that's what's actually happened so our body is our biggest form of communication and it's imperative that we learn to listen to our body and to teach our clients to listen to their body. And once that person listens to their body and identifies there's a tension, the next question is to say, well what is my tension? What is my challenging situation? What is the event that I perceive loss of control over? And again I'll go through these steps in more detail. And then after we work out the understand, like the trigger, the tension, then we go, well how can I teach you to develop the skills to manage that situation. So I understand anxiety to mean not feeling equipped to manage whatever is in front of you. So if we're saying that today, it's the 27th of September, I actually don't know, 26th of September and it's 11 o'clock, when I talk about what's in front of us, I don't mean tangibly what's in front of us but from 11:01 for the rest of my life is in front of me and if there is anything that is presented to me in that period of time that I don't completely feel completely equipped to manage, my anxiety levels are going to increase and whatever I don't feel equipped to mange, that's what I call our challenging situations or our tensions, so the only way we're going to support people is to teach them how to feel equipped to manage with that particular tension. So everything we teach is really simplified in the sense of number one, when's my body tell me I'm experience a challenge, number 2, what is that tension, number three, how can I develop the skills so I feel equipped to manage that tension so it's no longer a tension. And these three steps are the steps that I live myself. But I'll give you some more detail on those. So you saw on the Fabic three step, there's a behavioral scale. We call this a behavioral scale but you could equally an anxiety scale, and an anxiety scale, as I mention the word anxiety is simply not feeling equipped to manage whatever is presented in life. So if you don't feel equipped to manage, you don't feel like you have control over that situation and please note that as I talk about the word control, there is a big difference between control and controlling because they're two totally different things. So as I use the word control, I'm talking about how equipped you feel to manage, or as the words here also have is self mastery. So at code blue, that's when a person is free of tension, that's when their body is soft, it's relaxed and they're, they got no challenging situations presented. So they feel completely equipped to manage whatever is presented to them. So that's when a person has 80 to 100 percent perceived control, or as I say, 80 to 100 percent self mastery. But focus on the word perceived control, because perceived control is what that person themselves feels equipped to manage. It's not what i think you feel equipped to manage. It's what they feel, so if I was giving one of you a glass of water and I think, oh well that's a very easy task for you to do, so I think it's a code blue task, here's a drink, have a drink. But if unbeknownst to me, you have a fear of glass or dropping a glass or whatever it may be, you don't feel equipped to manage that so your anxiety levels are going to increase. So it's important again when identifying what it is that that person feels equipped to manage is understanding from their perspective, not what we think but what is real for them. So blue is 80 to 100 percent perceived control or 80 to 100 percent self mastery. At code green is when you've got 60 to 80 percent perceived control. So you can see there's a slight loss of control, not a major but a slight. So if you read on the chat there on the right hand side, we've got the word a little bit there. At code yellow is when the person has 40 to 60 percent perceived control, or 40 to 60 percent self mastery. Then up to code orange, it's 20 to 40 percent perceived control, and up to code red, there's zero to 20 percent perceived control over whatever is being presented at that time. At code green, I said we've got the word a little bit. That's really a little bit of any emotion. That's when a person is a little bit sad, they're a little bit anxious, they're a little bit angry, they're a little bit tired, they're a little bit hungry, they're head's a little bit full of information, or they're a little bit of anything, even a little bit excited. Because you go, oh excited, that's a good thing, isn't it? Only if you have the ability to regulate that emotion because a lot of people don't even feel like they have the skills to regulate a high level of excitement so I'm sure you've all experienced or seen people go from excitement to meltdown quite quickly and that's just because of their inability or they don't feel completely equipped to regulate that particular emotion. So green is a little bit of anything, yellow is more sad, more excited, more tired, more hungry, more difficult, more I don't like something, more of anything. Orange is a lot, a lot sad, a lot excited, a lot tired, and then we get up to red which is really, really. Really, really tired, really, really sad, really, really hungry, really, really hard, whatever it may be. But as you can see, that scale is reflective of all of us. Every single one of us in the world are going from blue, green, yellow, orange or red on a regular basis depending on our perception of our current experience, depending on how equipped we feel to manage the current experience that we're in. But when we get to red, like the faces on here cannot be completely accurate because a lot of people see red and straight away think anger, but code red is anything. A melt down might be a person crying. Another melt down might be a person drinking a lot of alcohol. A melt down may be a person having excessive drugs. A melt down may be a person eating a whole mud cake to themselves. There are so many different examples of what a melt down would be, but that melt down is basically saying, I don't want to feel what's going on in my body right now, so I want to suppress what my body is sensing. So on the right hand side of the scale, we're supporting people to learn to listen to their body. You can see that on the right hand side, I've given you an example of a lot of people's behaviors of what they're using to indicate they're going up the scale. So at code blue this particular person is enjoying their clients and whatever they're doing now. They have relaxed and soft muscles. They're talking openly without reservation to all people and their ability to support their clients comes freely. So that's when that person's body is free of any tension and when they go up to green, there's a slight feeling of dissatisfaction or tension. Their jaw tightens just a little bit. At green, their focus has to be on something other than what they're doing, like how many of you have been sitting with your clients yet thinking about what you're cooking for dinner tonight? Just a simple example but if you're doing that, straight away you're higher than blue. You're not a hundred percent presented with what's going on right now. Or even you're shoulders just a slightly tightened. But if you just all put your hands out for a moment, yea, the hand feels free of tension, yea? That's a blue hand. Now just hold it firm. There's a slight tension but not a massive amount but you can feel a slight tension. That's at green. Now just tighten it a bit more so you can feel more tension and it's even starting to come down this part of your hand, so now that's a muscle that's at yellow. Now tighten it even more. That's a muscle at orange. Now tighten it even more. That's a muscle at red. So going back to honesty without judgment, how often is every muscle in your body feel like this? Yea, 'cause as soon as one muscle in your body is slightly hard, then you're away from blue. Yea, but more often than not we ignore that and we often ignore it until people are all the way up to orange and then red and going how did I even get here? So the right hand side is all about supporting people to listen to their body because your body is your biggest form of communication but one of the issues that can happen with society is that we just focus on the body. We just focus on the behaviors, and we tell people to stop the behavior. So we focus on that right hand side of the scale and say those behaviors are inappropriate, stop it, but what we're not doing is saying, but why are you doing them in the first place? And from my perspective the why is so much more important. Like I said, I don't care what behaviors people are using, they're just expression. Those behaviors are simply that person's way of communicating, and whether they need to be at a lower intensity or higher intensity, it is not about judging those behaviors. It's about saying, well why are you doing them? And the why is going to the left hand side, and the left hand side is what we call the challenging situations, the event the person does not feel completely equipped to manage. So whatever it is for that individual that they don't feel equipped to manage is their challenging situation. And we'll go through some examples of those, but the thing that's important to remember with those challenging situations is that they can be immediate challenging situations or they can be what we call historical challenging situations. Now has anybody ever read the book, Who Sank the Boat by Pamela Allen? So I'm going to give you a bit of a children's story. So this is the book, Who Sank the Boat by Pamela Allen. And the premise of the book is that there's five animals, well first of all that there's an empty boat. And then you've got five animals who decide to go for a row. We've got a cow, a donkey, a sheep, a pig, and a little tiny mouse. And the question throughout the book is who sank the boat. So the first animal that hops in is the cow, the one that we think would be the most obvious to sink the boat, but the cow, it certainly makes a dent in the boat but it doesn't actually sink the boat. And then you get the donkey. If you can see the facial expressions on this book, it just cracks me up every time. But the donkey then comes in, and the donkey again would seem to be the most obvious, but it doesn't sink the boat. But can you see the boat's actually getting lower in the water but it hasn't sunk. That one cracks me up. Then you've got the pig, fat as butter, it doesn't sink the boat. Then you've got the sheep, and look how far that boat is from sinking, but it still hasn't sunk. Then if you can see there, you've got the tiny little mouse, the smallest of all, and it's what sinks the boat. But that chart, that book, it is exactly reflective of the behavioral scale. When it comes to identifying the challenging situations, the first challenge is the thing that takes us from blue to green, but unless we're really in tune with listening to our body, we actually don't acknowledge that. So that challenging situation has now taken us up to green, but because we don't deal with that challenging situation then, we allow it to stay in our boat. And then, the donkey, another trigger, another challenging situation, so then we go up to yellow. And then the pig hops in, another challenging situation and we get to low orange. The sheep, high orange, and then it's the mouse that causes the melt down. So you know the saying don't cry over spilled milk? Or it's the straw that broke the camel's back? Or it's the mouse that sunk the boat. It's the smallest of triggers that often causes the melt down. So when I go back to talking about let's identify the challenging situations, the challenging situations that we need to identify are the mouse but also the cow, the donkey, the sheep and the pig. And if I give you an example of a man that I used to work with a long time ago, he had a, he was in his mid forties when he came to see me, and on appearances, he ticked all the boxes in terms of his life is amazing. He's got a wife who adores him, that he adores. He's got two children, he's got the house, the white picket fence, the car, the perfect job, and everything just seems to be going smoothly for him. Yet he starts going shopping every now and then or is out in public and he just bursts into tears and he doesn't understand why. And he's then starting to develop a little bit of a social phobia because it's so unpredictable when he's going to start crying so he's like, I actually don't want to go into public because the anxiety of not, not feeling equipped to manage when he's going to cry or not is a little bit too much for him, so good for him that he came to counseling and he's seeking support for that. So we identified that when he was nine years of age, he was involved in a very serious car accident, one which his father died in. So would you all agree that's a massive cow? Yea. But at that time, he wasn't given the tools to know how to deal with the grief, the sadness, and everything that came up as a result of that so he came through life and did what I call burying, which I'm going to speak to you about as well, but through life, he's buried this issue and he's now got on with life and he's become the responsible person. He's become very focused on everything he's doing, and he on the outside it looks like he's doing everything really, really well. But when he's going through the shopping center, this took a lot of analysis to get to, but when he was walking through the shopping center, every now and then he would smell cures aftershave, and the cures aftershave was what was worn by the ambulance officer at the time of the accident. So when he got that smell, it now triggered all this bucket load of grief from the cow that he never actually dealt with, so it's so important to not just look at the, the mouse, but it's extremely important to consistently being open to looking for the cows, the donkeys, the sheeps, the pigs, and the mouse. Does that make sense? So when I'm talking about the fact that we're all the same in that we're all different, would it be fair to say that everyone in this room has their own cows, has their own donkeys, has their own sheeps, their own pigs, and if I come to you with a cow that you have the same cow, you're not able to support me because you haven't actually dealt with the cow. You might give me all the knowledge. You might tell me all of the correct words, but because you're not actively living, dealing with your cow, it's not going to support me. So the level of responsibility, how I'm saying is that we're number one. We are no different to our clients, we need to live these steps, as I'm consistently living these three steps for myself of trying to identify when's my body telling me I'm higher than blue, and as soon as my body's higher than blue, I then say well why is my body higher than blue? What's going on for me that I don't feel completely equipped to manage? And that can be the smallest of things or the biggest of things but the more refined you develop this, the quicker you start to pick things up. Like for an example, the other day is for myself, I'm particularly careful about the foods that I eat and the drinks that I drink and I live a gluten free, dairy free, sugar free diet just because I know those things take me higher than blue. Because that's how refined you can get to even the food that you eat can take you higher than blue on the scale, so if I know that I'm, they're the sorts of things that take me higher than blue, I'm very careful about what I eat. But a couple of weeks ago, after, oh it was about lunch time, but I'd had a very busy few days at work and I found myself at Kohl's in the gluten free, dairy free section looking at the biscuits, and it would tick all the boxes to go, well that's gluten free, that's dairy free, you can have that, but it wouldn't support my body, but the mere fact that I was standing there looking at that told me I was higher than blue. If I was eating them, then I would have been at red. That would have been my red, but just the fact that I'm standing there, I just went okay what's going on, there's something that's happened today that I haven't registered. There's something that I felt challenged by that I actually didn't acknowledge, I just ignored, and that's why now I'm standing here looking at these biscuits. So then that marker for me gave me an ability to backtrack and go, okay when did I last feel at blue? And the last time I felt at blue was, say, eight o'clock that morning so between eight o'clock and twelve o'clock, something's gone on. Then that allowed me to microanalyze, to get back further to work out what the trigger was. But can you see that's such a higher level of refinement than say my client who would be far off from being able to identify it that way but they're looking at well, when are my muscles going tight? Yea, whereas if I know now my muscles are tight, then I'm probably at yellow. So the first step if you identified of three step process was step one, not when am I at red, but step one, when am I higher than blue, which means when am I at green because a lot of people wait until they're at orange, until they're at red before they actively seek support but for me, now it's when am I at green, yea, because green gives me the opportunity to then be honest about what my trigger is. And then when I work out what my trigger is, I then need to work out well how do I change that. So the Fabic three step process, the behavioral scale is based on the understanding and the I choose chart is based on the changing of behavior. So what we do with the I choose chart is underneath where it's got the title I choose chart, we actually take, sorry, go back, oh wrong way, see on the left hand side we looked at the challenges for the practitioner. We didn't actually go through the examples there, but some of the things that were taking this person higher than blue, say at green was interruptions, not getting to what is needed because they're interrupted, misinterpretations, complaints from customers, being super busy, not knowing how to do something, there's just a whole list on the left hand side of the behavioral scale that I gave you of all of those challenging situations so we need to understand that each one of those challenging situations is what that individual does not feel equipped to manage but understand that there's, if I filled out one of these behavioral scales for all of you, you're all practitioners, the information in it would be totally different. Yea, this is just an example but that side is the challenging situations. So we then go to the I choose chart and take one of those challenging situations and with one of those challenging situations we then say how do I teach you the skills to feel equipped to manage whatever it was that you did not feel equipped to manage. Another issue with society is when we focus on changing behaviors, that we always focus on saying stop, stop using that behavior, that's inappropriate, it's unacceptable, you'll get expelled, you'll get, lose your job, people won't want to be with you, whatever the words are but all of those words mean exactly the same thing and that's just stop. Stop doing what you're doing, whereas as I understand it, the behavior is the person's only skills that they currently have to manage the situation that they currently do not feel equipped to manage. So if we just say stop, we're just saying stop using the only skills you've got to deal with the situation that you currently don't know how to deal with, so then the person because I've not met a person that wants to use code red behaviors, yea, but if we just say stop, that person will try really hard to stop, and then a few days later, a few weeks later, a few months later, it just comes back again, or they develop another behavior that is equally if not more maladaptive than the first behavior was. So option 2 behaviors are the behaviors we want the person to stop, but the option one behaviors is where our role comes in as a teacher. Our role is to teach the person the skills to feel equipped to manage the thing that they don't feel equipped to manage, and I always say whether you're a parent, whether you're a teacher, whether you're a practitioner, our role is all the same and our role is to support people to become independent and responsible in this world and the way that we support independence and responsibility is by teaching the people the skills to deal with the things they currently do not feel equipped to manage, so the option one behavior is just about saying how can I teach you to feel more equipped to manage with the things in life you don't currently feel equipped to manage. So an example that I have over here is an option two behavior, is basically saying when I'm at higher than blue, and higher than blue does not mean red as you can see the example is when I'm higher than blue means code green, code yellow, code orange, and code red. Option two, the first one under option two is to say ignore my body, where on the other side of the option one behavior it says identify the code I'm at by listening to my body. So as you'll see as we go down the option one and two, they're what we call incompatible behaviors. It is not possible to be doing option two while you're doing option one. You can flick quickly between but it's not possible to be doing the two. So the second one for option two is don't acknowledge or identify my challenging situation, whereas the other side is identify what my challenging situation is by asking what's the situation that I feel loss of control over. The third option two is put in zero strategies or ways of managing my challenging situation, so I just bury the feelings in my body. Or the option one is to say identify and in brackets ask for help if needed, and that's what we as practitioners don't do or very rarely do we do. Very rarely do we go to our own practitioners to ask for help ourselves. But identify what strategies I could use to change my experience and master my identified challenging situation. But understand the difference between by master whereas on the other side I say bury, and in a moment I'm going to talk about the difference between relief strategies and truly healing because a lot of the time we think we put in play strategies but there's actually relief strategies which suppress the behavior but don't actually make you feel equipped to manage the challenging situation. So that's a huge difference and so the fourth one for option one is to use the strategies. The outcome of option one is that my experience with the challenging situation changes whereas the outcome for option two is my experience of the challenging situation stays the same. So what we do then is present this to a person because everything we talk about is loss of control so the way we support people to develop the skills to come back closer to blue is to give control back, and as practitioners one of the worst things we can do is tell people what to do, whereas one of the ways to support them is to give them choices so when we have a completed I choose chart, I then say now it's your choice. If you'd like to keep choosing option two that's fine, that's your choice, but these are the outcomes, but just know that you're responsible for choosing these outcomes and if you would prefer to have different outcomes, so potentially the option one outcomes, then here's an alternative, and now that's your choice as well so that's totally up to you. So then what we're teaching people is you are in control of your behaviors, you are in control of your choices, but our role is to support them. Did you have a question? No. So our role is to support them to develop the skills not to tell the person what to do. Does that make sense? Cool. So I'm just going to keep going through and then just leave it open to questions at the end. Is that okay? Yea. But as you can see here I've done one, given you one example of an I choose chart, but as I gave you the example before with the behavioral scale, there was probably fifty different challenging situations just for that one person, which means fifty challenging situations that need to have have an I choose chart for. And we have a book out in the foyer area that has 27 different examples of I choose charts, but I can tell you that every client that comes into Fabic we create I choose charts for based on whatever is presented for them at that time. And when I say an I choose chart, it may equally just be thumbs up, thumbs down. This is option one is thumbs up, this is option two which is thumbs down. So when I said to you I work with a 22 month old person, they get thumbs up thumbs down. They go away and they start speaking and they start telling their parents when they're doing thumbs up thumbs down much to the parent's delight. But then you can make it more complex. If it's a person who's dealing with rejection, if a person who has experienced corrections, if a person doesn't have the right ingredients in their fridge to cook the thing that they're wanting to cook, like the endless tensions that they have in life, we always have choices. So my language is always based on the fact of it is never actually the challenging situations that take you to blue or red, but it's how you choose to respond to those. However it's inappropriate just to say how you choose to respond to those unless the person has taught the option one and that's the biggest error because we expect people to say well you're responsible, you choose your behaviors, you go and manage your life, but their behavior was first saying to us I don't feel equipped to manage that which means I don't have the skills, I don't know what my option one behavior is, please teach me. Does that make sense? So as I mentioned earlier there's what we call relief strategies and truly healing strategies. While I'm talking about this section, if you could have in front of you the completed example of the behavioral scale that I've given you. One of the biggest issues again with society is that we just deal with the behavior but we don't deal with the reason why the behaviors are occurring, so what we do is we support people to relieve the symptoms of the unwanted behavior but we actually don't support them to understand why they needed to use those relief strategies in the first place. So a simple example of that is if one of you guys came home from work at code orange, and you realized that you're at code orange and you decided to go for a run. So you put your clothes on, you go for a run, you come home and you identify that you're at code green or code blue. Would we say that's appropriate or inappropriate? Appropriate? I would say that's a relief strategy. Yea, 'cause what that has done is it relieves the symptoms, it relieves the feelings of you being at code orange, code yellow, and code green but it never actually teaches you to understand why did you come home from work at orange, what has happened in your day that you haven't felt equipped to manage, what are the tensions that have one on in your life. So I'm not saying don't go home and go for a run, but I am saying look at why do I need to go for a run because if you are consistently coming home at orange, you go up, you go for a run, you go down, you go back to work, you haven't learned to deal with your challenges so you haven't learned to deal with your option ones, you go back up to orange, you come home, you come back down. And a vicious cycle is occurring and that same cycle can occur running or it can occur with a person who's on medication, like I've met adults who have been on a medication for most of their life, and they go up to red, the doctor gives them medication and then the doctor says, sorry, they get their medication, it suppresses the behavior. So because we haven't dealt with the left hand side of the scale, the person eventually comes back up and they go back to the doctor and say it's not working anymore, so the doctor changes the medication or gives an increase of the medication so it suppresses the behavior which works temporarily because we still haven't dealt with the left hand side. So the person goes back up and that vicious cycle is occurring. Now I'm not saying don't use medication, but I'm saying long term change will only occur is if we equally teach the option one behaviors to deal with the reason why they went up to red in the first place. But whether that's medication, whether it's going for a run, whether it's going into a drug and rehabilitation center or whether it's going into a psychiatric hospital, whether it's getting expelled from school or whether it's getting detention, it's that same cycle that society's living on and all of those strategies are often built on relief. Let's relieve the symptoms but let's not teach the option one so long term behavioral change will not occur if strategies are just based on relief and that's the same as relaxation strategies. Like we teach at Fabic one of the steps that we teach our clients is a stop, breathe, squeeze, communicate. So that's stop what you're doing, breathe in through your nose, out through your nose, and then squeeze and relax is based on progressive muscle relaxation. Now I teach my clients that the breathe and the squeeze part of that is helpful to bring the person down to green, but if it's used in isolation, it's a harming strategy because it doesn't teach you to communicate the only part of that stop, breathe, squeeze, communicate that works is the communicate, and the communicate is tell me what your challenging situation is so we can then teach you the option one behaviors to deal with that. So I'm not saying don't do the breathe and squeeze, but I'm saying that if you only do the breathe and squeeze, it will only work in the short term and the cycle keeps going round. Does that make sense? So this is a chart that I use that kind of encapsulates everything that we've talked about but the relief strategies is all about acknowledging and feeling versing ignoring and burying. So if you could see that just the cow went in, so the cow being the first challenging situation that was presented, whether that was thirty years ago, whether that was thirty days ago, but the cow is any event that has happened in that person's life that they do not feel completely equipped to manage. So the cow is the challenging situation. When we have our first challenging situation, we have two choices, option one and option two. An option two is what I call ignoring and burying. Option one is acknowledging and feeling, which is a part that a lot of people don't want to do. But the option two, the ignoring and burying, is also what I call the concrete truck. So the concrete truck is when we bring any form of relief in, whether that relief be the run in the afternoon, whether it be the medication, whether it be the chocolate cake, whether it be a bottle of wine, whether it be a cigarette, whether it be any bit of food that our body doesn't agree with, our mouth likes but our body doesn't actually like. They're like copious amounts of concrete, but the concrete is simply the layer of hardness that goes over that challenging situation that stops us from feeling the feelings that come with that challenging situation. So for the man that I was sharing with you earlier whose father passed away in the car accident, the concrete that was given to him may have also been in the food and all of the other things but the real concrete came from all of those around him who didn't want to feel his sadness which is a really important thing to acknowledge because a lot of even counselors do not want to feel the sadness of other people and because we don't want to feel the sadness of other people, we pull out any relief strategy that we can get, it's like stop those tears because that makes me uncomfortable, so for him he was given relief strategies in the sense of well your dad's gone now, you're the man of the house, yea, you've got to pull your socks up, you've got to help your mom, you're the one that helps your sisters, all of those sorts of things. So he was given the layer of concrete of responsibility in a harmful way. So he took on board that role so he became the role of the man of the house, and roles are another form of concrete. When we, like I said earlier, if we become identified by being a mother, it's a concrete. If we become identified by being a practitioner, that's another form of concrete, so there's many roles that become concrete. But if we identify, so he had his concrete of responsibility and so he chose option two which is to bury, that concrete came on and it stopped him from feeling any of the sadness that typically would come up in that situation. So then he had a donkey that happened, again we don't know what that was but he chose option two, another layer of concrete, so the layer of concrete puts that solid hardness over the person and it's so solid that you can't feel the stuff that's underneath. And we keep putting as you can see the blue layers, they're all the layers of concrete so we just keep putting layer upon layer upon layer of concrete and then we get to the stage of any mouse which is causing the meltdown, but the only way that we can truly empty our cup is by choosing option one, and this is a process that most people don't want to go down and this is why I'm highlighting why it's so important as us as practitioners to look at this because if we are able to deal with this for ourselves then we can truly support our clients throughout that process but the option two behavior was to ignore the challenging situation whereas the option one is to acknowledge the challenging situation so that's where the honesty comes in, the honesty without judgment. The option two was to bring the concrete layer over. The option one, the opposite, is to feel the hurt. That's what people don't want to do. And because they feel like that hurt is them, they become identified by that hurt. They don't actually want to truly deal with the hurt so the concrete truck is often the most attractive option out of all of them cause it's much easier to eat that conc- sorry to eat that mud cake than it is to feel what it felt like when my boss yelled at me today because the boss yelling at me and really feeling the depth of that, that's crushing but I don't want to feel that because society tells me don't be sulk, harden up, drink a cup of concrete, all of those statements, so we go along with that and drink the concrete and it just keeps building up and building up and building up. So the option one is to release the hurt by truly feeling the hurt and expressing the hurt. Then to let that go and when we let that go, the hurt is out of our body, it's not to become identified by it, it's not to indulge in that, it's just to say yes that hurt, feel that hurt, and let it go. But if you can look at that in truth, can you really see that we've all got lots of layers of concrete on us? We're they're jackhammers, we kind of need a jackhammer to come in and get through that because there's so may experiences throughout life that we've just buried so the consistent commitment that I have to support my clients is to be continually working on this for myself because the emptier my cup becomes, the truer support I'm able to offer to other people and for me the way that I do that is by always acknowledging that I am no different to my clients and I have a complete equality to my clients and I am no better or lesser. I may have a higher advanced skill in certain areas but they also have a higher advanced skills in other areas. So it's never about saying well I'm better or lesser than another. It's about saying we are all equal and we are all equal in the fact that we all have cows, we all have donkeys, we all have sheep, pigs, mice, and the commitment that we need to have to truly support ourselves is to be consistently working on our own cups. Does that make sense? So to summarize the Fabic three step process, I know I went through this slide but right at the beginning so let me just recap it. It is about listening to your body and working out when your higher than blue which is the right hand side of the scale and as soon as you're higher than blue, it's going to left hand side and saying well why am I higher than blue? And the why is not about judgment. This is so where we need the honesty without judgment because that's what people are not prepared to look at. We have an issue in society that I call perfectionism and perfectionism is one of the most debilitating aspects of our community because it's making people to not be honest because if we think that we should have no things in our cup, then we're automatically going to judge ourselves as soon as something comes up, whereas I teach all of my clients my favorite word is oops, and as soon as we're presented with something we don't feel equipped to manage or we use an option two behavior, oops. And by oops, it allows an openness to be able to develop the option one behaviors but perfectionism is so, so harming and so damaging to all of humanity. I work a lot with people with Ausperger's and I say it's one of the most debilitating aspects of Ausperger's because their level of perfectionism is intensified among most of humanity however it is still relevant for all of humanity. So can you see how simple the process can be? Rather than complicating and looking at what theory is this or what theory is that, just when's my body higher than blue, why is it higher than blue, how can I learn my option one behavior. And as I said, I live those three steps and when I'm higher than blue, if I can't work out why, I go and get support and if I work out why but I can't work out what my option one is, I go and get support. As my staff say, when you're going to your people, when they've noticed I'm higher than blue, Michelle who works with me is always going, when are you seeing your people again? But that's because she knows I live the three steps, yea, and we all need those three steps. So back to the first slide. It is really worth pondering what makes or motivate us to go into the field of mental health. Is it if we truly want to serve people, then our commitment must first to be to ourselves so that we can truly support our clients. If it's because I don't want to deal with my own issues, then we're continuing on the burying process because it's very easy to work with our clients who have higher intensity difficulties than us because then we don't have to look at what's going on for ourselves so for me it's extremely important to take all of that out of the, out of the equation and say I am no different to my clients. We all go to blue, we all go to green, yellow, orange and red. Any questions? Just wait for the microphone. 

01:10:20
[sil.] 

01:10:25
UNKNOWN I'm curious with clients who are invested in not feeling where there's been high levels of trauma, violence, or trust, how do you embark on teaching them how to be aware of their body when everything in them is telling them to not be aware? 

01:10:45
TANYA CURTIS Yes. And when you make that comment, it's true for 99.9% of humanity because most people are invested in not feeling. So the way that I support people is by living what I teach, yea, it's not me standing up here telling you that because I want you to go, oh look what Tan does. The reason why I talk about the way I live is so that you can see that there is a possibility, there is a way to do that which if you start living that as well, then it will also open the door for your clients to see that there is another possibility so I had a client last week, a fifteen year old boy who's seen professionals all his life. And he didn't want to come and see me and his parents said we're not going to get him here. I said your job is to get him here, my job is to keep him here. He comes in with this attitude and kind of sits down arms crossed like what are you going to teach me and starts off by saying, I ask this to everybody, nobody can give me a good answer, but what's the purpose of life, so it's like no messing around with him, let's get straight to the point so I knew I was being tested and tested in a very big way and I said well it's different for everybody and the way I see it is the purpose of life is that my job is to be a reflection to other people so if I can offer a way that I think is an appropriate way for other people to live, it gives them another way, whereas if I live in a way that's truly harming, then I'm also saying that's okay for other people to harm themselves, and he just looked at me and goes that's the only decent answer anybody's given me, I'll stay and I said fair enough, but why I'm sharing that is because that's we need to do is live what we're teaching. So if you're living in a way that's also not wanting to feel, then you're clients won't want to do that, but it you're living in a way that's open to starting to feel, then that's also supporting them to say that's it's okay. However the other response to that is also understanding that every bit of behavioral change is on a ruler of zero to thirty, so a zero to thirty centimeter ruler and zero centimeters is a starting point and thirty centimeters is our ultimate goal. But if we look at the ultimate goal of people to feel where they're at and that's thirty centimeters and we try to go from no feeling to total feeling, it's too big of a step so all behavior change whether that's working with a alcoholic, whether it's working with a person who's having tantrums, whatever it may be, all has to come on on the zero to thirty centimeter and make sure that we offer steps that are small enough that that person feels competent to be able to achieve 'cause going back to the statement of perfectionism when I was saying everyone has the issue of perfectionism, most people won't live zero if they don't think that they can do it, so our role in the teaching role is to make sure that the first step that we present a person is one that takes them to yellow and not higher on the scale and if the person chooses to stay at zero, our role is to break it down further because the first step we presented was too overwhelming for them. So it's not about ever saying the person doesn't want to change, it's just because people do, yea, but they're not often being given the tools to know how to do that effectively. So it's not about saying they don't want to, it's about saying, A, am I reflecting that to them, and B, have I broken it down in a way that is small enough for them to achieve? 

01:14:35
UNKNOWN So what you're saying, for instance, I have never experienced, thank you god, sexual abuse. 

01:14:40
TANYA CURTIS Yes 

01:14:40
UNKNOWN I have done a lot of work for myself and I do it and still continue to do a lot or work. But I don't have a real honest concept, conception of being invested in trying to contain the level of hurt and trauma that somebody who's been abused as a child 

01:15:05
TANYA CURTIS Yes 

01:15:10
UNKNOWN So yes well I can support them and I can break things down for them but what I'm trying to find is that, that little step of how do I help someone to get started on that journey, make that first little toe over the line step from zero towards beginning to notice their body and to listen to their body. 

01:15:35
TANYA CURTIS That's why I use the behavioral scale to make it visual to support people because the word feeling often has an inappropriate misinterpretation to it and a lot of times, people hear the word feeling and think it's negative, yea, but what you're trying to do is teach people that we are feeling all day everyday, yea, like right now you can feel the soles of your feet. Yea if you put your fingertips together, you can feel them as they touch each other, whereas I teach my clients if you breathe in through your nose, it's cool on the tip here as you breathe out through your nose, it's warm on the tip here, so supporting people to feel is just teaching them to connect in very small steps like that so one of my clients coined this the other day, the feet, fingers and nose, so I was teaching him as he's walking to feel his footsteps and to feel the fingertips and to feel the tip of his nose. That's feeling, yea, we don't have to go to the grief because that's too big of a step but we're just bringing it back and teaching people to feel connected to their body, yea, so and that's the small step. 

01:16:45
UNKNOWN Alright, thank you.

TANYA CURTIS Cool. Anybody else got questions? No, alright, you guys just want to get out early for lunch, don't you? Alright, well thank you very much. Any questions, I'll be here for the next couple of days. We got a stand that's moved since I was, came in here, is it just outside now? Yea just outside now so there's my book, my DVD's, other things there, all these charts that I've shown you are all available in different sizes as well, but I'll be there for any questions. Thank you.
