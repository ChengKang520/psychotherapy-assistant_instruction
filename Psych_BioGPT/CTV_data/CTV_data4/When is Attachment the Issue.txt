RICH SIMON Welcome, everyone. My name is Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker, your host for this series on Attachment Theory in Action. So, over the course of this series, we're exploring the practical clinical implications of what began a couple years ago in what we call the Great Attachment Debate. What we're focusing on in this series is what the actual difference it makes in everyday clinical practice to have uh, this attachment-based perspective. And today, we're going to really focus on a key question that uh, some of the critics of Attachment Theory and its implications for psychotherapy have brought up. Are we, are, is, has Attachment Theory-, is there a danger that Attachment Theory becomes a kind of procrustean bed. That every case we have to trace it back to side kind of uh, attachment wound. And how does one make meaningful distinctions between cases and, and, people's, the context of people's lives in which attachment injury is a, is a, uh, the central issue. And cases where, perhaps, that's not the case. And we have the perfect guest this time. Uh, for this installment of this series. Bruce Ecker, who has though long and hard on that question and he's here to help us to make some of those distinctions. Bruce? Welcome to the party. How are you? 

00:01:35
BRUCE ECKER I'm good. Good to be here. Thanks. Thanks. You make them laugh right here at the start. It's great. 

00:01:40
RICH SIMON All right. Well, uhm, so let's, let's start off, let's, give people some-. I'm sure many people who are watching this are, are familiar with your work, but uhm, let's, let's start off by uh, talking a little bit about how you came to uh, the particular clinical perspective that you've come to and, and what's really interesting is that you uhm, began by looking not at group norms and groups of uh, diagnostic groups, but on this fascinating issue of therapeutic breakthroughs and identifying the cases in your practice where something quite remarkable, a, a, uhm, a great leap had taken place in the psychotherapy. So why don't you tell us about how that happened and what you discovered once you began to look at those cases in which that were characterized by what most of us would consider a therapeutic breakthrough. 

00:02:45
BRUCE ECKER Sure. Yeah. Well, I suppose, uh, we were both, uh, my clinical collaborator and I, Laurel Hulley. I think were both sort of uh, effectiveness nuts or junkies from the start. 

00:02:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:02:55
BRUCE ECKER We uh, we had both personally experienced in our, in our personal lives, our personal development, some fundamental shifts that were liberating and impressive. So we knew it was possible personally. And then in the early years of our therapy work, we saw that happen with our clients very occasionally. Not often enough. 

00:03:20
RICH SIMON Right, not often enough. 

00:03:20
BRUCE ECKER Yeah, and uh, so we wanted those kinds of session to happen a lot more often than they were. But we did see them happen sometimes, so again, it's possible, right? So we, we decided we wanted to study closely session in which those kinds of deep lasting shifts happened. Session in which a client describes a, a, a deeply felt experience and then reports afterwards that some previous longstanding symptom had fallen away essentially. And so we began to uh, microstudy those sessions whenever they did happen to happen. We looked at both what happened inside the client to the extent we could elicit that from the client. And we looked at exactly what had happened in the interaction in the room. And it took quite a few years, uh, I don't know, five, six years, of looking for, is there an identifiable process or sequence of experiences that always accompanies that kind of change, whatever the presenting problem or symptom, and whatever the content that was brought into awareness from underneath. And sure enough, we finally arrived at a clear sense of what the key experiences are. So we began reorganizing therapy around that sequence. In other words, we would set out to, to aim for bringing about or guiding only that sequence of experiences right from the first session with each client. 

00:04:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:04:55
BRUCE ECKER To the extent humanly possibly given the complexities of psychotherapy. 

00:05:00
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:05:05
BRUCE ECKER we did see a very uh, significant, well I should say huge increase in our effectiveness and in the consistency, the frequency of guiding powerful change events in therapy. That's what we called Depth Oriented Brief Therapy back in the mid-nineties when we first started teaching it. Tucson, 1993, the first workshop. Our book, "Depth Oriented Brief Therapy" came out in 1996. Then in 2005, we changed the name to Coherence Therapy and uh, in that same year, we had undertaken a, a, a, a, a, a-. We soldiered through dozens and dozens of neuroscience research articles because we had decided to wanted to see whether or not the world of neuroscience had something that matched this sequence of experiences that we were using and finding so valuable. You know, we were convinced from close clinical observations that this is real. But, you know, we hadn't done a controlled study. And uh, it's just anecdotal. So we wanted to find some, some helpful corroboration out there. So we started persistently studying neuroscience research and came across memory reconsolidation, which had been discovered only five years earlier in 2000. And in 2005, we latched on to it because the reconsolidation research findings had identified the same sequence of experiences step for step. 

00:06:40
RICH SIMON So this, so let me pause here for a second because as soon as we move into neuroscience I, probably some of, some of our uh, folks who are otherwise quite rapt by your description may begin to glaze over a little bit. So say a little bit so what, why, why should we care about memory consolidation? What difference does memory consolidation make for psychotherapists? 

00:07:00
BRUCE ECKER Good question. Memory reconsolidation, you know, when, when a memory first forms, when a learning first occurs, and it's established in memory, that's the initial consolidation of the memory. 

00:07:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:07:15
BRUCE ECKER Uhm, and a century of research, since Pavlov, had created the impression that once an emotional learning is consolidated, it is indelible for life. 

00:07:30
RICH SIMON A conditioned response, uh traumatic learning? 

00:07:35
BRUCE ECKER Conditioned response. Yes. 

00:07:35
RICH SIMON Traumatic experience of some kind. 

00:07:35
BRUCE ECKER Any learning that is formed in the presence of strong emotion. 

00:07:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:07:45
BRUCE ECKER Creates special synapses that lock for life. And for therapy that, that was not good news. That seemed to mean the best you can do is counteractive work, you know, building up resources, building up ways to prevent a symptom from happening with preferred responses. 

00:08:05
RICH SIMON Alleviate symptoms to a certain extent, 

00:08:05
BRUCE ECKER Right. 

00:08:10
RICH SIMON But there was a limit, a neurobiological limit. Okay. 

00:08:10
BRUCE ECKER Yeah, in manage-, ongoing managing and effort to maintain such changes. 

00:08:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:08:20
BRUCE ECKER Well, uh, in 2000, it was discovered that there are conditions under which even the synapses of an emotional learning unlock and can be undone. And they call this reconsolidation. And it's really quite a breakthrough in the, in the science of learning and memory. Uh, it's quite a turnaround of what was a century-long tenet. Now, so this opens up the possibility that we can have a, a, a, a rigorous understanding of how deep lasting change occurs in clinical work. The field is so splintered. There are so many different views and opinions of what, of whether such change exists, what causes it if it does exist, different models, different languages, different metaphors. Now we have empirical knowledge of a sequence of experiences that can actually erase a specific targeted emotional learning. It cuts through all the theoretical camps and, and, uh, fractionalization of the field. 

00:09:30
RICH SIMON It's a common factor in a number of (crosstalk) 

00:09:30
BRUCE ECKER It's a common, yeah, I use the phrase in a different way, yeah. It can bridge across theoretical camps and I, you know, many of us feel that the field is too splintered. We're tired of acronyms. We want something more unified. We want a more reliable base of knowledge for what we do. 

00:09:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:09:45
BRUCE ECKER And that's it. That's it. That's why this is valuable. 

00:09:50
RICH SIMON Okay, so now, so just underlying what you're saying, so it's the experience that people uhm, clients sometimes report where if they've gone through a certain kind of uh, process, they can recall something that was deeply upsetting to them, but there's no affect to it. It's not as if they have amnesia for the experience. But it's not emotionally distressing. It's like, huh. I understand that was very, that was upsetting to me for all these years. But now I think back on it and I can, I can smile at it or I can just nod my head. But I'm ready to move on in life. That, that's basically the experience that you're describing, isn't it? 

00:10:30
BRUCE ECKER Do you mean an emotional learning that's unconscious? Implicit learning? 

00:10:35
RICH SIMON Uhm, I'm thinking of somebody's who's come in and they've uh, my understanding, and you'll correct me, is that what you're talking about is once somebody goes through this kind of reconsolidation process, the same thing that was getting them all upset and filled them with anxiety and angst or whatever it is. They can recall the experience or the trigger or whatever it is, but they have an entirely different emotional, by far more uh, syntonic balanced response. Is, is that getting it? 

00:11:00
BRUCE ECKER Exactly. Exactly. You've got it exactly. What, the way we use reconsolidation in therapy is it, it dissolves the emotional response and the emotional meanings that had formed but doesn't impair or affect autobiographical memory, your memory of what you experienced at all. So that's exactly right. You can remember the original experiences or you can be exposed to what used to be strong triggers of a certain emotional response that would manifest as certain symptoms or problem reactions. 

00:11:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:11:35
BRUCE ECKER Now, none of those emotional reactions happen. So it's the emotional reaction that disappears, no longer exists. And so changes that follow from a successful uh, therapy that uses memory reconsolidation, transformational change, the freedom from the symptom or problem is thereafter effortless. 

00:12:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah, okay. So let's, so, so let's uhm, move this. I'm sure many people are chomping at the bit to hear about how this, they may have experienced this occasionally in their, in their uh, practice and their uh, quite interested in hearing how this happened. So let's bring this to the ground level. And uh, also, let's uh, bring a uh, into focus our theme here today, how do we distinguish between cases where the issue is uh, some attachment injury, that somebody's showing up in your office and we have to do reparative work on early childhood experience, and some other category of emotional distress. So as a way of doing this and also illustrating your uhm, and perhaps we can do both of these things at the same time. How you work with people. Uhm, let's, let's talk about a case in which it would have been, uh, it was an open question whether this is a uh, attachment injury that's somebody's presenting a problem where there's, it has to do with uh, childhood abuse or some unfortunate early childhood experience and something else. 

00:13:10
BRUCE ECKER Good. Good. 

00:13:10
RICH SIMON Tell us about a case and then take us through the steps as you explore this. Give people a sense of uh, your model and method and these uh, the sequence that you go through. And also, how you determined this was not an attachment based uh, issue for this person. 

00:13:30
BRUCE ECKER Good. Good. Let's do that. Good. 

00:13:30
RICH SIMON Good. 

00:13:30
BRUCE ECKER All right. So, I'll, I'll, I'll, let's walk through a case with one of my clients. So this will be coherence therapy but I want to emphasize that this, this sequence of experiences that memory reconsolidation research has identified is not limited to coherence therapy. In fact, uh, one of the main focuses in our, in our new book, "Unlocking the Emotional Brain," is to show that in published case examples of several other therapies, we can identify the, this very sequence of experiences. We've got AEDP, EST, EMDR and IPMB, to spit out a few acronyms there. 

00:14:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:14:10
BRUCE ECKER Where this is all present. So, this is not, it's, it's, you know, it's not that you've got to buy into coherence therapy to use memory reconsolidation. But we, you know, we, we, uhm, we have a methodology in coherence therapy that's very explicitly matched to the memory reconsolidation steps. Whereas it tends to be a bit more implicit in the other therapies. But any therapist who's familiar with these steps can arrange to build them into the sessions however you work. 

00:14:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:14:40
BRUCE ECKER Okay. well, so let's talk about a fellow who is in his early thirties and he came in to see me because for several years, he had been, he has been staying in a job where he's abused by his boss. The boss yells at him. The boss insults him in front of other workers. The boss requires to put in a lot of overtime without paying him for it. And he's uh, he's staying there and he's not looking for another job. And at this point, this is hurting his own self-respect and it's also starting to cause uncomfortable ripples between uh, him and his fiancee as well as other people who know him and care about him. What's going on here? Uh, at that point, just from hearing his description of the, of the problem, you know, it sort of has the look of attachment issues. I think most therapists would, would think, oh, this is going to, this is going to land in some attachment territory. This, this looks like it's a guy who, uhm, this is his familiar role, you know? 

00:15:40
RICH SIMON You could take his family of origin. 

00:15:45
BRUCE ECKER Yes, family of origin, the boss as a parent figure, 

00:15:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:15:50
BRUCE ECKER He must have core beliefs that he deserves to be treated this way. That kind of thing. And I myself, you know, had that kind of hypothesis. 

00:15:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:15:55
BRUCE ECKER But I've learned to trust what we call the retrieval work. I don't go with inferences uh, heavily or theoretical notions heavily. I just do this experiential retrieval process. The idea is to bring the underlying emotional learnings out. This, this movement from implicit knowledge to explicit knowledge and experience. So that we lay bare the specific emotional learnings, maintaining his behavior of staying in his job. And then the material speaks for itself. You see whether or not attachment learnings are present as we'll see as we go through this. So, I launched into the retrieval work and uh, I think what I'd like to do if you feel we have time for it, is I could describe a few different ways that the retrieval could have been uh, pursued. 

00:16:55
RICH SIMON Okay. So, so, you give people a concrete idea of how you-, so this is in a first session. 

00:17:00
BRUCE ECKER Yeah, first session. 

00:17:00
RICH SIMON This guy has come in. He's described where he's at in his life. And so he's lay this and if you're a therapist you can, you know, we're good at this, we can come up with all kinds of hypotheses about what's the background. And often we're better at getting the hypotheses than helping people change them. And so at this point you're hearing this and, and to kind of yeah, give us an immediate sense, kind of the choice points. 

00:17:25
BRUCE ECKER Right. 

00:17:25
RICH SIMON That you see for yourself in working with someone like this. 

00:17:25
BRUCE ECKER Good. Yeah. Well, the first choice point is hearing what the problem or symptom is made of, enough specificity to have a clear sense of what it is. Not blurry, big general words of oh, I get depressed. Okay. You know, teasing out some of the experiential particulars of it. All right? 

00:17:45
RICH SIMON And you might ask what kinds of questions? Or what are you doing and saying to get the information that helps you make certain uh, decisions about the direction you want the session to take? 

00:17:55
BRUCE ECKER Uhm, let's see, with him, given that description I pretty much had what I needed already. Uhm, I might have asked him at what point in your years of working there uh, did it start to feel like you, you need to leave? It's hurting your self-respect. When did this develop? Uh, I might ask, what was going on in your life around that point that you didn't choose to change? Just anything that helps me, you know, I want to know the what, where and when of the symptom. What do you experience? Uhm in, in, in, in what situations do you experience the problem? what's going on inside of you when you experience the problem? What thoughts feelings and body sensations (inaudible ) are the problem happening? Sometimes I'll ask, how do you know when this problem is happening, to elicit some of those, you know, specifics. 

00:18:50
RICH SIMON And this, this young man is telling you, or perhaps he's not so young, the situation that he, and so in response to the question about the situations in which this occurs, uh, he was saying things like? 

00:19:00
BRUCE ECKER Well, in this situation, see, I didn't to ask that particular question. He's been in a job all these years. I think it was six years, something like that, taking this kind of mistreatment. So- 

00:19:15
RICH SIMON So he had specific encounters with this one boss in particular? 

00:19:15
BRUCE ECKER Yes. Yes. Yeah. And he named off several incidents of this, of this inappropriate treatment. So, you know, the problem was clear enough to me. He's in an abusive situation. It feels awful to him. He knows the right thing to do is to leave. He's getting that feedback from all kinds of important people in his life. And he stays. So, that's all I need to know to begin the discovery and retrieval work. And what we do is follow the principle of coherence. In other words, every emotional learning is adaptive. Whenever an emotional learning comes into explicitness, what you see is adaptive uh, striving for safety, well-being, justice. And the makeup of emotional learnings completely makes sense in relation to the experiences in which those were formed. And we'll see that as we move along here. So, at a, the techniques we used to do the retrieval work are all shaped around drawing out emotional necessity. What's the emotional necessity? The unrecognized emotional necessity of staying and taking this rather than heading for something better? So that's how I'm thinking as I sort of scan among my repertoire of ways of eliciting underlying material for, you know, which way of evoking a sense of emotional necessity presents, looks like the best fit here. Now one way we often do this, we have a, we have a set of basic techniques that we teach. Although the approach is not defined by specific techniques, you know, you need techniques to teach how to do it, so we have a basic set. And one of them is what we call Direct Empathic Eliciting. It's not even a technique. With him, this would have sounded something like my saying to him, I wonder if there might be something you know in your life about how just staying put is what's best for you, not heading for something better that you want? Uh, does some part of you know something about that? And so that kind of direct invitation for emotional necessity, emotional sense, in a, in a somewhat soft, empathic voice to cue for, you know, please look below the neck for this information? You know? A felt, a felt knowing. Uh, that's often very effective. Another technique is what we call an Overt Statement inviting the client to try on a simple statement that captures some of this expression of emotional necessity. In other words, just working backwards from behavior, he's staying. He's not moving on. So you could give him something to say that just asserts as a declarative statement, I'm staying. That simple. For example, I could have had him say, Even though it's so clear to me and to everyone who cares about me that I should leave this job and head for something better, no. I better not do that. Now a client might giggle when you ask him to say something like that or feel self-conscious. But, you know, just, you know, try it mechanically. Just say it mechanically. And then, try saying it again. And very reliable technique. Something will start to bubble up of the implicit emotional necessity, because you see the statement starts to give that part of him a voice. And it jumps at the opportunity and something further will start to come. And we just start to reel in what's surfacing. 

00:23:10
RICH SIMON So, stay with that for a minute, Bruce. So what might you, as he says that, and there's something in, you know, to say I'm staying. And then what, what might you say so you can see that he's, something's happening inside and uh, (crosstalk) 

00:23:25
BRUCE ECKER Yeah, okay, yeah. I might say. 

00:23:25
RICH SIMON What do you say? 

00:23:30
BRUCE ECKER It looks like that has some resonance for you. Is that right? Yeah? It does, huh? So is it something you feel in your body at some particular point (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. I can feel it right in my chest there. 

00:23:40
BRUCE ECKER Okay. So let's see. All right. Just focus on that part. Maybe he's, maybe he's internally say to that area, yes I'm aware of you. Is there something else you want to add to those words? 

00:23:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:23:55
BRUCE ECKER And something will come. It may be words. It may be a memory. It may be an image. It may be another body sensation. But we're on our way now. We're moving along the linkage. 

00:24:05
RICH SIMON You have a foothold, a therapeutic foothold. 

00:24:10
BRUCE ECKER Yes. 

00:24:10
RICH SIMON You have something so that you're beginning your climb. Okay. 

00:24:10
BRUCE ECKER That's right. 

00:24:15
RICH SIMON Okay. Great. 

00:24:15
BRUCE ECKER So all of these techniques move along the linkage from the symptom to the underlying emotional learnings necessitating that symptom. There's a very real internal linkage. And we're just wanting to bring conscious attention along that pathway into the material. Another technique that's often very reliable, one of our mainstays, is Sentence Completion. These, these unconscious implicit learnings can, you can't resist the temptation to complete a well-chosen sentence fragment or the over statement. One for him could have been uh, uh, my job really is miserable for me, but if I try to leave it and find something better, dot, dot, dot. Right? So he'd be instructed to say that, hit the blank and let it complete itself with no pre-thinking. And again, with high reliability the unconscious emotional learning involved here would have something to say to complete that sentence. We do that over and over, same sentence stem. Let the ending complete itself over and over. I write down all the endings, and we start getting to it that way. The uh, the last of the retrieval techniques I'll mention, and the one that I actually used with him, is what we call Symptom Deprivation. If, if indeed a particular problem pattern or symptom is emotionally necessary, well, then having an imaginal experience of being without that symptom in a situation where it happens will bring some kind of discomfort or distress or difficulty. Whatever the necessity is, is being disallowed so they'll be some experience of oh, this is not okay. We identify. We have the client identify that, that discomfort, describe it. And that's now the point of access because by bringing out the specifics of the makeup of that discomfort, well, that's it. The emotional necessity of the symptom is the avoidance of that. 

00:26:25
RICH SIMON So that, in this case, with the, just describe for us. So, what did you, how did that work with this particular client? And what did he say? 

00:26:35
BRUCE ECKER Good. Yeah, yeah. I guided him to imagine an experience of beginning to take action. So this is symptom deprivation. So I'm going to deprive his symptom of not looking for and arranging for a better job. So I simply guided him to imagine looking for some possibilities, lining up a few companies to start to contact and making contact. You know, I had him picture sitting, you know, where would you be sitting to do that? Okay? And really specifically imagine it. Feel it. And the first sign that it was working was I saw him uh, subtle kind of shifting in his chair. It was like a slight squirming. You know? Or a stiffening. Uh, you know? Uh, and, and then a few moments after, yeah, yeah, a hand, one of his hands went to a knee and squeezed. Okay? Uh, while he's imagining this. And then, uh, within about ten, 15 seconds he said you know, I've lost track of what you were asking me to do, which is another good sign that something's developing. Okay? So, I said to him, is something happening that's distracting you? And he said, he said, yes. I, I don't know why, but, but a memory's coming up a memory of the worst time in my life. And so I said tell me about it. 

00:28:00
RICH SIMON Oh boy. Here, you're thinking here, here we go, huh? 

00:28:00
BRUCE ECKER Yes. I knew before hearing any details that I'm about to learn that included in what I'm about to learn is an emotional learning, and an emotional necessity that's going to make total sense of staying put in this job. 

00:28:15
RICH SIMON Now here we are, just to set this, we're in a first session? 

00:28:20
BRUCE ECKER Yeah. 

00:28:20
RICH SIMON We're how long into it? We're a half hour into it or what is it? 

00:28:25
BRUCE ECKER Yeah, 25 minutes, about half way through. 

00:28:25
RICH SIMON Okay. Just, all right. And, and here we go. You're, you're zeroing in and your whole notion of your approach is that with, with these kinds of tools your assumption is that you can identify, you can tailor, not in a vague and a generic way. Well, this is this kind of problem so I need this kind of intervention. But with specific uh, circumstances and of the constellation of experience that has led this person to be involved. 

00:28:55
BRUCE ECKER Yes. Exactly. Exactly. So he starts to tell me about this memory that's coming up. And it's a doozy. He tells me about uh, the end of high school. And how he was a track and field star athlete in high school. And he was heading toward the last of the high school track meets of his high school career. And he had already won a college scholarship, an athletic scholarship and was, you know, glowingly looking forward to his coming glory as a collegiate star athlete. And uh, in the process of training for this final high school track meet, he sustained an injury. And uh, with a medical exam to check out what's going on, a, a bone disease was detected. It wasn't lethal. It wasn't uh, malignant. It wasn't life threatening. But it did end his athletic career with crushing suddenness. And uh, you know, he, he was somewhat uh, he was disconnected from his emotion as he talked to me about this. It was a bit matter of fact. But he was describing a, a massive shock, a loss of the future life he thought was in his hands, you know? It was at his fingertips. Uhm, a loss of identity. And a sense of colossal injustice, unfairness. He had worked so hard so many years to, to build up his abilities and deserve this. And then it was ripped away so arbitrarily. So you can imagine the numerous simultaneous blows in this, in this experience. Well, after he described all that, I said to him, again, try to stay on track with coherence and what, you know, it's easy to get lost in such powerful rich material surfacing. Uhm, but I managed to stay on track and I asked him, I said to him, I said, your memory of that terrible loss came up as you were imagining looking for a better job. There seems to be a connection between those two things. See if you can feel what the connection is. Can you feel into that? Look back and forth at those two things. Feel the connection. What can you say about that connection? So he, he sat still. He, he was trying to do what I said. And then he said, he said, it's thinking that soon I'm going to have something better that I really want. He saw that that was the shared link between the two. And then I said to him, you got so hurt when you were thinking that you were about to have a wonderful life you really want in college. I just mirrored it back to him, empathically. And the tears started rolling down. This isn't a guy who sobs, but you know how it just spills over and just starts to stream down. And uh, so we're there. We're now, we're there. I can see what the emotional learning is. But there's still more work to do to really have him see it. He's, he's immersed in this subjective material. I need to guide him to really see it. And we, we do that with verbalization. Uh, we, we work together to find words that do justice and capture what he suffered and what it meant to him. You see, in coherence therapy we certainly focus on emotion and emotional process and allowing emotions that have been blocked and avoided. But just as importantly we work on the specific emotional meanings or mental models uh, these templates that people form in these experiences that get used in life separate from the memory of the original experience. You know, the, the basic way implicit memory works. We form a template that the emotional brain then uses for vigilantly watching for that kind of thing ever happening. Uh, without any referring back to the original experience. And so, in, in the verbalization, we're looking for words that, that bring into explicitness the mental model, the construction of reality. 

00:33:30
RICH SIMON Well, and the beliefs, so he has, he-, life beliefs that are-, come not out of the blue or some rational process. But the conclusions, the beliefs that were shaped by his particular, this specific experience he had. 

00:33:50
BRUCE ECKER Yeah, yeah. The emotional brain is always on duty trying to make sense of experience and forming these learnings. And knowing how to make sense of future experiences that are similar. So here's the wording we came to. It was a real collaborative, sensitive process of- 

00:34:05
RICH SIMON And, and how does that process, before we hear what the-, how does that process go between you and the client? 

00:34:10
BRUCE ECKER You know, I would say uh, about a new piece that he had just referred to, how would you say that in words? You know? Uhm, he would say it and I would say it back to him. And then he'd say, no, no, no. That's not quite right. It's this. And then I might suggest a phrase for a part he hasn't named yet. But I do so in a very deferential way. Does this, does this feel right to you. Does this fit just right? Is there any piece of that you want to, you want to tweak? So, it can uh, it can be, you know, quite a quite a wordsmithing for some of these things because people are amazingly sensitive to the accuracy of the words fitting the emotional material. If it's off just a little bit, people really feel that and you can see it in their response. They're not still immersed anymore. And I've noticed, I've learned to notice that and say is something off in how we're putting into words? So here's, here's what we came to, and I, I wrote this on an index card and I handed it to him for him to read. And I said try, try saying this out loud to check it for whether it really fits as your own emotional truth. It's so important for the client to feel it's here or her own emotional-, not something the therapist has an agenda for. And he read out loud what we'd come to. And he read, life suddenly took away and crushed the top notch life that I worked so hard for and deserved and was going to have. I've got to never again really want anything or really try to anything I want because then life could crush me again. If I try for a better job, it could happen to me again so, no thank you. We've learned to be very deliberate that when we bring a client, when we guide a client to arrive at these deep emotional learnings and meanings and expectations, and a certain problem and a certain solution that's urgent, it's very important to then-, so it's like, that's half the trip. That's the trip down. We call that uhm, connecting down. And then there's connecting up, back up to the specific presenting symptom, the starting point of all this. Link it back up. So that's why I made sure that wording ended with if I want to try for a better job, it could happen to me again. So, no thank you. It's at this point in the process where the client now is suddenly aware of the, the adaptive coherence, the emotional necessity for what seemed irrational and dysfunctional that a sense of personal agency dawns in relation to the problem that seemed to out of control, like something that's happening to me, you know? And a lot of people have- 

00:37:00
RICH SIMON I'm, I'm the victim of, of these circumstances. Yeah. 

00:37:05
BRUCE ECKER Yes. Yes. And, and many people, I'd say most people in our experience, had a lot of negative self-talk about their systems, you know? I'm, I'm bad, sick, stupid or crazy, basically, and all kinds of variations. And as soon as clients uh, retrieve these coherent, poignant meaningful truths in their lives as the living sense of their symptom, those negative self-pathologizing meetings just evaporate. That's a lovely therapeutic effect here. And even though we're at the midpoint of the process those things fall away. So, that's, you know, that's a good example, I think, of an emotional schema. That's what we mean by retrieval. It involves that degree of specificity and accuracy and coherence. All right. So let's see, where do we go from there? Uhm, okay, this is the point where we can now (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
RICH SIMON And, once, and so just so that we catch up a little bit here. So he said this. And he's never made this connection for himself before. 

00:38:05
BRUCE ECKER Right. 

00:38:05
RICH SIMON And with your help, you've uh, he's, he's come and there's this connection between these words, this belief, this emotional meaning in your, in the way you put it, and what's happening in the room? What's, what's this like for him? What's going on? 

00:38:25
BRUCE ECKER The tears continue to stream as we're working on the words and as he reads it. It's very moving for me, and that shows, you know, uhm, in in the nonverbals. I, I, I, I let the clients see that I'm very touched by the depth and poignance and pain. 

00:38:45
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:38:50
BRUCE ECKER And uhm, I might ask, how is it for you? Suddenly here, to see and feel how staying in one job is, is, is so connected to such a powerfully meaningful experience in your life, you know? Just do the meta processing, the, the transparency about what's the nature of the process of this experience of making this conscious. 

00:39:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:39:10
BRUCE ECKER You know, that's a nice, a nice piece. A lot, a lot can come out of that. 

00:39:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:39:15
BRUCE ECKER Yeah. Now, for our purposes here today, this is where we can return to the question of attachment. 

00:39:25
RICH SIMON Yeah, which one, yeah. 

00:39:25
BRUCE ECKER Yeah, it's right here where we have the specifics of the emotional learning maintaining the symptom that we can just stare at it and see whether attachment learnings are involved. Now, when we stare at this emotional truth, this schema that we've got now crafted into, into words, I think what we see what, what, what it looks like to me is, I don't see attachment learnings there. I see what we call existential experience, existential learnings. So in other words, this was an experience of the uh, the unpredictability and the uncontrollability of life. Uh, the very fabric of life. And I think that's what we mean by the word existential, difficulties and challenges that are built into the very fabric of life. So, we see this as an existential learning, not an attachment learning. And there are (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
RICH SIMON But from the point of view of uh, as a clinician then, practically, what's the decision point for you? What might you have done if this, in fact, had been uhm, you had gone back to uh, some experience of him growing up in an abusive household and his, his father was in competition with him and never wanted him to succeed. So, what's the difference between what you're actually going to do in your next step as a clinician if it's one set of circumstances versus this uh, a young man of 18 perhaps, uh, or so, who encountered this existential learning? What's the, what's the practical difference? 

00:41:10
BRUCE ECKER The, the answer to that question is provided by the reconsolidation sequence of experiences. Here's what I mean. Uh, the sequence of-, I think what we'll do is just jump ahead to that because it's what's needed to answer that question. 

00:41:25
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:41:30
BRUCE ECKER The sequence of experiences that will dissolve an existing emotional learning is actually very simple. However, it requires two key ingredients before you can carry out this simple sequence that just takes a few minutes to do once you've got the key ingredients. Sometimes it seems to me like, you know how when you're going to have the interior of your house painted, or the exterior for that matter? The prep work can take weeks. 

00:41:55
RICH SIMON Yeah, right. 

00:41:55
BRUCE ECKER And then as soon as the prep work is done the paint job is done in hours. Well, the prep work here is first the retrieval work that we just looked at. And there's another piece of prep work because what's needed for this dissolution through reconsolidation is an experience of a very contradictory nature to the makeup of the symptom requiring emotional learning. Uhm, a living experience, an emotionally real, vivid experience that absolutely contradicts and disconfirms some key piece of that schema, that now we know the pieces of, you see. So at the point where the retrieval work is done and we've got a clear understanding of the makeup of the symptom requiring learning, the next piece that the therapist starts to focus on is how do we find a contradictory experience? 

00:42:55
RICH SIMON Contradictory, uh huh. 

00:43:00
BRUCE ECKER Contradictory living knowledge, something that'll be very, as viscerally real as the makeup of this, of the schema. And then to guide what we call a juxtaposition experience. And this is what the reconsolidation research identified. That it's the experience of what uh, they often call a mismatch, something that disconfirms the expectations, the model of reality, the predictions that the target emotional learning contains. So, uh, to answer your question, the choice of what kinds of experiences to look for that could serve as the disconfirmer uh, or to put it another way, uh, new learning through this contradictory experience that operates as the eraser of the target learning. That choice depends on the makeup. So if we had found attachment learnings, experiences with his family life or his father, whatever, then that would steer the search for contradictory experiences in corresponding directions. So again, it's very attuned to the client's material. 

00:44:15
RICH SIMON So, for example, so if let's, let's go down both these roads and how, and you've, I'm sure, had extensive experience in both directions. So, if this was some early childhood experience. He had a mental model, a belief system that was keeping his tracked. He hadn't, wasn't aware of it. You're looking for contradictory experiences and, and, as a source of beliefs that uh, that, that can challenge this belief system. If it was an attachment rooted experience, what, what concretely might you have done in those circumstances? 

00:44:50
BRUCE ECKER There's a range of possibilities. There's a nice range of choices that therapists have within this reconsolidation framework. In fact, it opens up a, a particularly wide range of choices. Uhm, what I have in mind in saying that is that uh, it's been my experience you know, reading the Networker, going to conferences, talking with colleagues, I think most therapists who are attachment focused tend to assume that the way to uh, create deep lasting change with attachment material is to do reparative attachment, to use the relationship, the therapist-client relationship and to use the client's experience of the therapist's empathy and acceptance and validation, etcetera to heal the emotional wound. Well, within the, within the reconsolidation framework, the understanding of that is that the experience of the therapist's empathy is the disconfirming contradictory experience that can dissolve core learnings and expectations that the client is carrying as attachment learnings such as, I'm not a person who anyone would ever treat that way. Uh, it's not a world where anyone would ever understand how I'm hurting. That's a very specific attachment learning that I've come across in many clients. 

00:46:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:46:15
BRUCE ECKER All the details, models of self and world and relationship that get formed in attachment suffering and attachment trauma, are, they're all very specific. Once they're properly fully retrieved, there's all the specificity we've seen in the example we've been looking at. And so, the therapist, the experience, the positive experience of the therapist can disconfirm, you know, those models and meaning and learnings. That, that's often the case. We often work it that way with coherence therapy and many therapies work that way too. Now, what reconsolidation reveals though is that once you know the makeup of the target learnings, you're not limited to the client's positive experiences of the therapist to create disconfirming contradictory experiences. There's a whole world of different types of experience that can be used to do that. So you probably want an example don't you? 

00:47:15
RICH SIMON Yup. That's, that's what we do here. 

00:47:15
BRUCE ECKER Right. All right. Let me cook one up for you or remember one. Let's see. Okay. Uhm, okay here's one. Here's one. This is an example of, of a woman who uhm, now let's see. We're launching into a whole second example here and we're still midstream on the first one. So I'm going to try and make this very succinct. 

00:47:45
RICH SIMON Edit this one down for us, yeah. 

00:47:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. Right. This is a woman to came to therapy uh, I wasn't, I wasn't the therapist. My co-director, Sarah Bridges at the University of Memphis was the therapist. And she came for therapy because she feels no sexual uh, desire or pleasure with her husband. She's avoidant of sex with her husband even though they're emotionally close in other ways. Okay? So I'm just going to drop right down to the emotional learning, the emotional schema that was found. Okay? Uhm, she suffered uh, a type of sexual abuse in her family of origin. Both parents were very flamboyant sexually, exhibitionistic and voyeuristic. Uh, one of the experiences that came to memory in the retrieval in the work here was of uh, she was in the bathroom masturbating and her mother walked in and found her doing this. Mother's response was not anger or horror. Mother's response was delight, joy. How wonderful! And Mother went off and called all the family friends and told them, as well as family members. This was a massive mortification and exposure for this girl. And so she formed, now in terms of attachment, this, this demand for no privacy sexually was completely woven into the attachment fabric in the, in the family. This was how- 

00:49:20
RICH SIMON So let me, let me, okay. 

00:49:25
BRUCE ECKER This was how she would be uhm, most special to Mom. This was how she would get Mom's best attention and praise and cherishing. So attachment (crosstalk) 

00:49:35
RICH SIMON So, so, and just, so, so to make sure that we you know, that we stay on focus. What I'm trying to get at is, is there something uh, from your framework. So, many therapists who are doing attachment based echotherapy talk about and, and uh, in our uhm, the uh, our previous session, our interview with Diane Poole Heller. She really talks about the importance of the, what she calls presencing secure attachment in the therapy room. And so with early preverbal experiences of, of uh, attachment injury, the premise of many folks who do this sort of work, it's hard to talk about meaningfully about such experiences and to provide corrective emotional experience for that. In your way of working, uhm, your saying that these reparative kinds of uhm, re-parenting experiences or these, this kind of secure attachment experiences, that can be a disconfirmation with these certain schemas. But as, as your thought is that not necessarily that, that even an attachment injury can, might be, have the same, might be positively influenced by another sort of intervention? Is that, is that your position? 

00:51:00
BRUCE ECKER Yes. Yes. I think there are two cases. Two, two situations in connection with what you're saying. There's the situation where the client's revealed attachment learnings clearly can be disconfirmed and dissolved by the positive experience of the therapist's understanding and empathy and attunement. 

00:51:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:51:20
BRUCE ECKER Even in those cases where reparative attachment of that kind can be used, the therapist still has the option of using other methods that could, what I mean is, uhm, can find something other than the- than a positive experience of the therapist as the disconfirming focus. You see? 

00:51:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:51:45
BRUCE ECKER Even in those cases, the quality of the client therapist relationship is still absolutely necessary for the work to happen. 

00:51:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:51:50
BRUCE ECKER But then it's catalytic, you know? The question here is whether the positive experience of the therapist is used as the disconfirming experience matched with a piece of emotional learning. So reparative attachment is where the relationship is used to do the disconfirming. But even in situations where one could do it that way, one can also find other disconfirming contradictory experiences (crosstalk) 

00:52:20
RICH SIMON Through, through the course of the person's entire-, it needn't be an early childhood experience. It could be something much later down the road. 

00:52:25
BRUCE ECKER That's right. Yeah. Yeah. And then there's a case where the revealed material makes it clear that a positive experience of the therapist could not possibly serve to disconfirm it. And that's the example I was just trying to give you about this woman. Because once it's clear that uhm, well, I yeah. Should I continue with that and finish it off? What do you think? 

00:52:45
RICH SIMON Well, if we can. So we're coming towards the end here, so is it- so just- 

00:52:50
BRUCE ECKER Yeah, which one shall we finish? 

00:52:50
RICH SIMON Well, I mean, let's, you know, let's just do what we do here. We edit a little bit. So in terms of we'll get back to our our young man who had the athletic injury. But you've certainly gotten our attention with this other story about the woman who had this uh, this humiliating experience with her mom. So what wound up being-, or how did you use that? What was the disconfirming experience with her? And we'll see if we can bring that to conclusion. 

00:53:15
BRUCE ECKER Yeah, very quickly. She realized uh, part of the retrieval work was she realized she was expecting her sexuality, to have precisely the same effects on her teenage daughter as her mother's had on her. As a little girl, she, now children form very black and white notions of things, even on the implicit learning level. So she formed the implicit learning that oh, when a mom is sexual it affects the child the way I'm suffering here. And that's what was shutting her sexuality, the necessity, here again is the emotional necessity, of not harming her daughter the way she was harmed. None of that was conscious. 

00:54:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:54:00
BRUCE ECKER So she went home from the session, uh, focused (crosstalk) 

00:54:00
RICH SIMON So had worked in the session to put into language as you demonstrated so nicely before, with this woman, that this in fact had been a, a belief that was driving her life and her sexual relationship with her husband? 

00:54:15
BRUCE ECKER Yes, a belief in the sense of a powerful emotional expectation of that. Yes. 

00:54:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:54:20
BRUCE ECKER And so now it's conscious. She's living day to day, uh, aware, I'm not going to be sexual with my husband even though it's costing us dearly in our marriage in order to protect my dear daughter from suffering the way I suffered with Mom. Okay? She comes back into the next session and a disconfirmation experience, a contradictory knowing had spontaneously come to awareness because some part of her, well, she came, basically she said, my, wait a minute, my sexuality is different. It's not going to be the same as with Mom. 

00:55:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:55:05
BRUCE ECKER I, I have my sexuality. It's, it's really different than hers. See, that, that wasn't in the young girl's model that formed initially. 

00:55:10
RICH SIMON That's right. Yeah. 

00:55:15
RICH SIMON And so, that's, it's very nice when the disconfirming material is already in the client, but it was in a separate compartment. 

00:55:20
RICH SIMON That's right. 

00:55:20
BRUCE ECKER And once the uh, underlying learning is retrieved, the brain does this automatic uh, search for consistency of knowing. There's a mismatch detector inside. And in about half of cases we see some already existing living knowledge comes in and and so this one came in and said, you know expecting that it will hurt my daughter like, like I was hurt, it seems kind of silly now. She said, she used the word silly. Silly is a marker, we've noticed. When something that had been deadly serious (crosstalk) 

00:55:50
RICH SIMON That's interesting. Silly is a marker. 

00:55:55
BRUCE ECKER Yeah, you know that the emotional schema is dissolving or dissolved when you start to hear silly for what had felt very dire. Yeah. 

00:56:05
RICH SIMON So it's as if the, by uhm, making the implicit explicit, you make it possible for uhm, the, the more psychologically developed aspects of the self to actually have a kind of conversation or be able to witness these other aspects that before were just the water in which the person was swimming as opposed to something they could capture in language. And then (crosstalk) 

00:56:30
BRUCE ECKER Yes. Yes. This insulated area of emotional learning suddenly is exposed to everything the whole personality knows. 

00:56:35
RICH SIMON It's integrated. Yeah, okay. 

00:56:35
BRUCE ECKER And so, about half the time it, it just rolls forward into the thing by itself. And then we just we, we, we notice that it's happened and then we deliberately guide a further really focused juxtapositioned experience of those two parts. (crosstalk) 

00:56:50
RICH SIMON Okay, so here we're, so you're symphonically, you're orchestrating us coming down the home stretch. So now let's come back to our uh, young man here. And we're moving towards the end of our conversation here. And uhm, uhm, let's, you know, with your baton, take us to the, to the finale of that case and how this uh, this guy managed to come out of it (crosstalk) 

00:57:15
BRUCE ECKER With this guy, it didn't go that way. He, he didn't have an already existing knowledge come forward and do this. So we had to deliberately find it. And we have, you know, there's a number of techniques we had developed for doing that. In fact, we're right now working on a manual of techniques for finding contradictory knowledge. 

00:57:35
RICH SIMON Contradictory learning. 

00:57:35
BRUCE ECKER Yeah. Right. Once it's clear what needs to be contradicted. 

00:57:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:57:40
BRUCE ECKER So what I used with him is what we call the Unacceptable Costs Method. I, I, I, I said to him in the next session. He, he, he came in and reported that he had stayed in touch with this. He continued to feel true. You know, until a, a juxtaposition, a disconfirmation happens, the, the conscious material continues to feel just as dire and real. These things don't just fade out from becoming conscious. When they seem to fade out from becoming conscious, it's because this juxtaposition happened inside implicitly, uhm, not just from integration. So he came in. It still feels real. It's true. I better not want a better job and, and try for it. So I said to him, you know, I had stared at the makeup of his schema. And I looked for what, what looks the most-, what can I find a disconfirmation for most readily? 

00:58:40
RICH SIMON Where's the leverage with this, this particular way of looking at life? 

00:58:40
BRUCE ECKER Yeah. And it was clear to me, thinking about his schema after the sessions, that his solution of never wanting or trying for a want wipes out the rest of his life. And his life with his fiancee. To never again overtly head for what we want, and I could tell he didn't notice that yet. Right? So I planned to implement this Unacceptable Cost technique and it worked. It might not have. And then I would have to find some other contradiction, some other disconfirmation. So I said to him, I have a question for you. How is it for you to recognize so clearly now that this solution of yours for protecting yourself from ever again being crushed like you were at the end of high school actually rules out for the rest of your life ever again heading towards something you really want? Something that you and your fiancee might really want together? For the rest of your life. 

00:59:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:59:55
BRUCE ECKER And, silence. He just stared at me. Just seconds went by as this registered and he said to me, I don't remember his exact words, but I remember the gist. It's as if he said to me, I hadn't thought of it that way, you know? It's like, whoa, this is a further new metacognitive recognition of what he was up to on an implicit emotional level. And so his surprise confirmed that yes, we now have contradictory vivid knowledge here. And so over the next five, 10, 15 minutes, I kept repeating that juxtaposition experience in very naturalistic ways. Just sort of, you know, I'm so, uhm, expressing my own amazement that, you know, just, just again, empathically referring to this one, empathically referring to that one. Knowing that that's putting them both in front of him again to look back and forth between and feel that experiential dissonance. And finally after three or four of these, I said to him, so how is it for you now to be in touch with these true opposite experiences of how you protect yourself? And this guy had a certain style. He again just looked right at me. He just did that kind of thing. And then he said something like, what was I thinking? What, you know? As it, as it's computing, as it's all getting integrated awareness, every part of him is now in on this. Okay? So, that was a nice indicator that, that uh, a deep potentiation of emotional realness was happening. That's just what we want to see. 

01:01:40
RICH SIMON Right. 

01:01:40
BRUCE ECKER And then, and now we're wrapping it up. Then I did the standard verification step that we do in Coherence Therapy at this point. We really try to re-evoke the original emotional learning, because we need to see if it's re-evocable. 

01:01:55
RICH SIMON Yup. 

01:01:55
BRUCE ECKER That's one of the markers. That's what the neuroscientists do too in reconsolidation research. They try to trigger that puppy to happen again as much as they can, and when it just won't happen again, then they say it's erased. That's their marker for erasure. It's our marker for erasure. So I had him read that statement on his card. That full declarative statement of why never trying for anything is so urgent. And that sets a pretty reliable way to reinvoke that, okay? And he read it. And he uh, again, he, I had him read it twice, you know. The first time is often just mechanical. Read it again. And he looked up at me and he said, I have his exact words for this. He said, "well, I sure can see why I would have reacted way. But now it's like hearing about somebody else." 

01:02:45
RICH SIMON Oh boy. 

01:02:45
BRUCE ECKER Yeah. Oh. You know, driving home after a day where there's a session like that is, it's a good feeling And we're, we're putting this process out there because we can be that effective a lot more often than many of us think is possible with this process. Yeah. 

01:03:05
RICH SIMON All right. Well, I think this is a great place. We need to stop, but what a uh, energizing. Man, who wouldn't want to have, you know, to have an experience like that once a week. Once a month for many of us would be really energizing. 

01:03:25
BRUCE ECKER Yeah, it's possible. 

01:03:25
RICH SIMON But to have that on a more regular basis, so very (crosstalk) 

01:03:25
BRUCE ECKER That's what this is all about. That's what our new book is all about, try to put this in people's hands. 

01:03:30
RICH SIMON Okay. Well, so, that leads us directly into so, those people who are intrigued by what you've presented and want to learn more about your method and training opportunities and materials that they can read, and uh, free materials they might check out, where do they go? 

01:03:45
BRUCE ECKER Good. Well, our website is a central hub of all this. It's coherenceinstitute.org. 

01:03:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:03:55
BRUCE ECKER Coherence is all e's, except for the o. And uh, and you'll see all kinds of stuff there about this. There's materials about reconsolidation. Uh, we'll soon have a section on the, on the new book, on "Locking the Emotional Brain." So there's links to that there.

Bruce, in his, has very graciously agreed, he will look at the comment board. If so moved, he may well respond. In any case, the conversation that he has begun with us today will be continued.
