LIVE: BOSTON SEAPORT WORLD TRADE CENTER Ruth Lanius, M.D., Ph.D. 

00:00:00
RUTH LANIUS My name is Ruth Lanius and I'm from the Western University of Canada and I'm gonna be talking about transforming the self through mindfulness meditation and neurofeedback. And it's actually great because a lot of the earlier speakers have given part of my talk so I'm gonna focus on the things that are new and I think what we've heard throughout the day is that there's really overlapping neurocircuitries between mindfulness and the neurofeedback, the alpha-down neurofeedback that Tomas has, has just talked about. So I'm gonna talk about an approach of using these two types of therapy in really complexly traumatized populations. But to start out with I'd really like to acknowledge the collaborators on these projects, Tomas Ros, Rosemarie Kluetsch, Jean Théberge, (inaudible ) who's in the audience, ah, Vince Calhoun as well as John Butlers(ph), Susie Selequel(ph), Stephanie Nevel(ph), Nancy Maza(ph) and Maria Densmore. So, we'll start out by discussing the effects of chronic trauma on the sense of self and then, ah, we'll describe the neural correlates underlying the sense of self and relate those findings to the use of mindfulness meditation and neurofeedback training. And then look at using this type of training in a stage-oriented approach for people with severe early life trauma. We're all familiar with PTSD symptoms, we all know that they don't adequately describe populations with chronic early life trauma and we know the importance of the diagnosis of complex, PTSD, other people like to look at it in terms of psychiatric comorbidity.

DR. DESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 34TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:01:40
RUTH LANIUS So the patients will be looking at today, will really be suffering from a lot of comorbidities and Wendy(ph) talked about how, you know, we have to take a trans-diagnostic approach because chronic early life trauma really affects a whole umbrella of symptoms. But I think what this diagnosis don't really capture is the sense of self that is really disturbed with chronic early life trauma. And so when we think about the sense of self or self-referential processing in that population, how do we know that people have such a disturbed sense of self? So we know and we've heard from Wendy(ph) that-- and Jim(ph) and, ah, also, ah, Jon Kabat-Zinn that emotion recognition and awareness is really impaired in people with early life trauma. Often they're cut off from their emotions because emotions when they were growing up were futile, right? The emotions couldn't lead to the appropriate actions, you know, when they were child, when they were anxious and they wanted to flee, they couldn't flee, right? So this led to real disconnection and not being in touch with the emotional state. And we know we have autobiographical memory disturbance so our traumatized population often doesn't have a narrative. We also know that they have great difficulties often looking into the future, that there is no future, the future is black. They also have impaired theory of mind so really being in tuned what the other person may be thinking or feeling or what their intentions are and then we have dissociation, of course, so depersonalization, out of body experiences, the realization, you feel like everything is unreal, identity disturbance and fragmentation of the self. And we'll be talking a lot about fragmentation of the self. Now, I actually show two patients who, on a video, who had significant symptoms of fragmentation. 

00:03:40
"I was running on terror and the only way that I can describe it, in retrospect, was that it was a kind of animal survival psyche. My sense of self was pretty undefined and diffuse, as if the nerve endings had no stopping place, and so without a skin or without a boundary and without the other which creates that boundary, there isn't a self." Different Modes of Self Reference 

00:03:40
RUTH LANIUS So these are all disturbances that feed into this altered sense of self and I like this quote by, ah, someone with the history of complex PTSD who said, "I was running on terror and the only way that I can describe it, in retrospect, was that it was a kind of animal survival psyche. My sense of self was pretty undefined and diffuse, as if the nerve endings had no stopping place, and so without a skin or without a boundary and without the other which creates that boundary, there isn't a self." So thinking about the self, thinking about the sense of self, I think it's really to help-- it's really helpful to think about two different modes of self, ah, reference. And I'm very lucky that Jon Kabat-Zinn already talked about this. This has really been described in the literature going back to William James as a notion of me versus I and the neural circuit that has really been elaborated by Damasio, Nordhoff as well as most recently Farb et al. in 2007 and Jon talked about this paper earlier. So, when we think about the self, two modes of self-reference. I think it's important that we think about the self in the present moment and the self across time, right? And so the self in the present is the self that's really aware of what's happening right now. So that insula circuit, right, that more lateral circuit as well as sensory cortex and the insula. Whereas the self across time, this is when the default mode network comes in, right, which is really important in helping us create as narrative. And when we talk about working with people with complex trauma, I think it's even more important to be aware of these two different modes of self-reference because I think dealing with one at a time in therapy really provides a stage or in-depth model that is often tolerable for people. So what are the trained networks involved in self-reference and we've heard a lot about this already today so I'm just gonna review it. Again, the present self, we know through Farb studies and also with Kilpatrick(ph), the recent study that the salience network is really important in the present self. So this is when you have the insula activation that really allows us the experience embodiment as Jim(ph) really beautifully talked about this morning an interoceptive awareness. And it also really functions to turn attention to the most relevant internal and external stimuli in order to guide behavior so it's a really important network. And we know that this network is altered in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder and again that makes sense. Our patients have great difficulty turning their attention to what's most relevant internally or externally. And then the self across time, this is when the default mode network comes in and we've heard a lot about this today. And our group has proposed that the default mode network may really be a model for the sense of self in people with chronic early life trauma. And so a lot of people have shown this network, it really consist of the posterior cingulate cortex which you can see right here and that's an area important in figuring out what self-relevant and that is really connected to the medial prefrontal cortex that's so important in self-reflective awareness so being able to reflect and-- of-- about what's happening. And again, when we think about our patients, they can't do that, right. They have really decreased reflective capacity and there's real disconnection with their emotional states. 

00:07:40
The Default Mode Network • Refers to the activity state of the brain at rest • Active when individuals are not focused on the external environment • Is active when individuals are engaged in internally focused tasks, including autobiographical memory retrieval, envisioning the future, and conceiving the perspectives of others • Important in extended self-reference linking experiences across time • May help the organism to respond to future environmental challenges. 

00:07:45
RUTH LANIUS And so as we've talked about earlier, the default mode network really refers to the activity state of a brain at rest and it's really important to, ah, create a narrative because its brain areas overlap very much with the brain areas that underlie autobiographical memory as well as thinking about the future. So it helps us to have a sense of ourselves across time in relationship with the past and with the future. What do we know about the default mode network in PTSD related to childhood abuse? We know that the network is very disrupted and we did a study several years ago with Robin Bloom(ph) as the first doctor who did a post-talk with us who, ah, first looked at controls to see whether we could replicate the default mode network as other proofs have shown it and, and indeed we could. And then when we look at patients with PTSD related to early life trauma, this network was very disrupted and you barely had any connectivity with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, that area involved in self-referential processing and the lateral parietal areas that are really involved in a body cognition. So we thought that this type of disrupted default mode network may be a good model for the altered sense of self-experienced by patients with chronic early life trauma. So how can we restore or transform the sense of self mindfulness meditation as part of a stage-oriented trauma treatment. And I think when we start thinking about this, we need to go back to the healthy controls or the healthy subjects that have been studied and lets go back to that Farb study who really talked about the different modes of self-reference. So, in a healthy subject, these two modes of self-reference are sort of habitually connected, right? And yeah, the self across time really flows in with the self in the present moment. And it's through mindfulness meditation that we actually try to uncouple the two, right, that we decrease that narrative self and really focus on the present self to create a tension in the moment. And some people have suggested that a narrative focus has been shown to increase illness vulnerability but I think we have to see in some cases and that'll become obvious in the second when we talk about the lack of sense of self in a traumatized population. So, in a healthy population, these two networks habitually interconnected and the goal of mindfulness, ah, meditation is really to uncouple the two and Jon talked about earlier how this increases the insula activation and decreases the default mode network connectivity, the narrative self. So, now we move to a population with a severe chronic early life trauma and we've talked about how this population often lacks a sense of self, these people often don't know who they are, and the sense of self has never developed or the sense of self has been severely disrupted as a result of the trauma. So, now we're dealing with the population that really doesn't have a self in the present moment, right. We talk about how these individuals are disconnected from their emotions and they don't have a self across time, right. There's no narrative self, they don't have a narrative with-- for what they have experienced. So how can we approach that in a, in a stage-oriented manner that will not overwhelm a person? 

00:11:30
Stage-Oriented Approach to Mindfulness Meditation in Traumatized Individuals STAGE 1: ► Self in the present moment ► Salience network 

00:11:35
RUTH LANIUS So, just-- as a general approach, Jim(ph), ah, talked a little bit about this in a question period today, is when we think about stage-oriented trauma treatment and the use of mindfulness meditation, it may be helpful to think about stage one treatment really focusing on the self in the present moment. Now, if you did this in a healthy population, you would get people to really focus attention on body sensations, emotions, internal thoughts, and external sensory events all at the same time, right? But we know that if we do this in a traumatized population, we're gonna severely disregulate someone because people wouldn't be able to tolerate that. And Jim(ph) talked about this a little bit in the question period so I think we need to titrate this, right? Starting with just focusing on bodily sensations and when somebody can tolerate that then we add the emotional experience. And when somebody can able to tolerate that then we add the internal thoughts and then we add the external sensory events but really at a rate that feels safe for the patient and it's gonna be individualized, it's gonna different for every individual. And so, when we think about stage one and really focusing on the self in the present moment, that's I think when we really activate the salience network or maybe normalized the salience network that we know is altered in patients with post traumatic stress disorder. So I briefly wanna show, ah, couple of videos just working with sort of a titration of first focusing on bodily sensations and then combining the bodily sensations with emotion and a bit of metta. This is, ah, very chronically traumatized, ah, man I'm seeing. I've seen him for approximately 4 years and I would say he's, ah, really able to identify bodily sensations now, work with bodily sensations and emotions and we've started to use narrative work. So, this I'm gonna be showing a body scan and I'm just gonna focus on the two feet and ankles and we're just gonna focus on the bodily sensations and just notice how much information we get from just the feet and the ankles. We've seen tremendous disconnection which I think is mirrored in the fragmentation of a self that he experienced. We'll get in that in a second. So this is just, you know, a couple of brief examples looking at increasing the present self, increasing, you know, the insula activation, and really getting in touch with the present moment from a body-up approach. And then, you, you know, using those bodily sensory experiences and using a bottom-up approach and then going towards emotions and cognitions eventually. And then when we think about, ah, using mindfulness in stage two treatment, I think this is really where the self across time comes in, right? This is where we create a narrative self and as a we all know, our patients often don't have a narrative, right. And if they have bits of narratives especially if they have severe fragmentation, it's not a singular narrative, right. It's al-- it's often a narrative that's experienced from the perspective of multiple selves. And so I would propose that this stage of treatment really brings on line the default mode network. Again, this is the patient we just, this is a painting, how he depicts himself and that you can, you can see from this painting that he has different states of mind and each is really represented by a color. And what's really become obvious by doing this body work with him and identifying these body sensations is that the fragmentation he experiences and that's shown on this painting here is really mirrored in what you experiences in his body. And so when he actually draws the body scan I can show you the whole thing. We see that his right foot is disconnected, his right hand is connected and he also has difficulties in the general region but he experiences this dic-- disconnection that's really mirrored by the fragmentation of the selves he experiences. And now what I wanna show you is about a 10-minute video of how we work with the body, how we start with the bodily sensations and then bringing in different states of mind of himself represented by different colors, how we can enhance that connection and actually getting him to start feeling like his ankle and his hand is connected again. So he describes a tingling in the parts that have disconnected before, he describes a feeling of aliveness and then he describes that this is represented by three colors which is gre-- red, green and purple which represents the three parts that were starting to connect. And through that he experiences much greater connection in his body and we've just started to work on that for a few weeks and it seems to last and, ah, he has a very different sense of himself in the world. So this is just an example of how you can start doing stage work, how you can start to work on a narrative and I think to work on a narrative you need to bring parts together so you can really establish one single narrative than-- rather than having narratives experienced by multiple selves. 

00:17:25

00:17:30
RUTH LANIUS And another thing he did was he actually made a little, ah, figure that he uses, ah, after he does body scans where he draws in what he experiences and that as his body sensations are changed, he, ah, keeps changing the figure then he draw, you know, ch-- ah, wraps it in white color again so he can start over again so that this can be changing as the sense of himself in the world changes. So, we've talked a little bit about mindfulness meditation, how we may approach it in a stage-oriented manner in traumatized, ah, people and we've also talked about earlier how mindfulness meditation and as alpha-down training neurofeedback that Tomas talked about involves similar neural circuitry, right, which is really in effect on the salience network and on the default mode network. So, can we use maybe alpha neurofeedback as an additional treatment to all the techniques we're already using to treat our traumatized patients and what does that look like? And I think it's important that we think about a variety of treatments we can use because as we all know treating these types of individuals can be very difficult, right, and I think the more techniques we have available in addition to, of course, a therapeutic relationship often the better treatment can progress. So let's talk about alpha rhythm neurofeedback. I'm glad that Tomas has already given half of my talk so I don't have to repeat the feedback loop, right. Basically, people get feedback about their brain rhythm on the computer screen and then they're asked to regulate it. 

00:19:10
Protocol: Reducing alpha amplitude (8-12 Hz) at Pz The "Space RaceGame" 

00:19:15
RUTH LANIUS And, again, what we did here, we asked people to decrease their alpha at Pz which is right here and, ah, what they saw on the computer screen was the space race game and so we told them just keep the-- the space should be moving. So the more the space should move, the more they were able to decrease their alpha. What do we know about alpha rhythm and neurofeedback? Again, Tomas has gone into this. We know that activity in the alpha band can be successfully modulated by naive participants and that it's really easy to learn and this is one of the reasons we actually use this protocol and it's also been shown that this type of neurofeedback may be beneficial in treating anxiety and attentional problems. We also know that alphas rhythm reduction has been linked to directed attention and cognitive processing and we now, as Tomas mentioned, have studies that have looked at brain networks using MRI as well as EEG at the same time showing that alpha power and changes in the default mode network and the salience network are there. So we know that the alpha is related to both the salience as well as the default mode network and these are the two networks, of course, we were focusing on in mindfulness meditation and now again in neurofeedback. So, what are, what are our objectives, hypothesis, we really aimed to investigate possible short-term changes in the functional connectivity within the salience network and the default mode network following a reduction in the alpha in a group of individuals with PTSD, all with chronic PTSD related to early life trauma and most of them had significant dissociative symptoms. And what we hypothesized was that alpha rhythm decrease would be associated with plastic alterations in both the default mode network as well as the salience network and would also relate to subjective changes and EEG patterns observed in the PTSD patients. So, we've hold the same methods as Tomas already outlined in his paper with healthy individuals, people had a resting state MRI where they just lay in the scanner and they were asked so that their mind wandered. Then they had an EEG, then they had 30 minutes of neurofeedback where they reduce their alpha, then they had another EEG and another resting state MRI, ah, scan. And-- so we were able to compare their brain networks before and after neurofeedback. Now, in terms of the subjective measures, we felt-- ah, found that 17 out of 21 of the patients we'd studied and these were really people with severe PTSD felt a sense of control and a repeat, ah, reported feeling more relaxed, calm and clear-minded after the neurofeedback. And we, ah, use the tier scale to look at symptoms of calmness and we found a significant increase in calmness after the neurofeedback, ah, treatment. It's also interesting that eight of the subjects reported increased, ah, fatigue, this was a mental fatigue but not described as negative sort, sort of, ah, fatigue like they experienced after yoga. One person experience mild drowsiness and three reported feeling frustrated when they're unable to move the spaceship. Now, in terms of the EEG results, there are very interesting and that they're actually different from the control group. 

00:22:50
I. EEG Results • Reduced alpha amplitudes during NFB followed by alpha "rebound" at Baseline 2 

00:22:50
RUTH LANIUS So what we saw was that during the, the neurofeedback, the PTSD patients were able to decrease the alpha but what we saw after the neurofeedback was that they actually had a rebound of the alpha so the alpha actually went higher than-- and we did not see that in the control group. And we think that this is actually may be reflected in the fact that people were learning to increase the range of alpha, that the window of the alpha may be small in PTSD and that, you know, this may be i-- increasing the window of flexibility of the alpha which may be really important and then activating this brain networks that exert top-down control. Now, let's look at what happened at the salience network after this one session of neurofeedback in people with post traumatic stress disorder. And what we saw was that after this one session, the insula actually came on line both on the right and on the left side. So this is this area we've been talking all day about really being responsible for embodiment and interoceptive awareness. 

00:23:55
Increased SN Connectivity after NFB Relationship Between Changes in SN Connectivity and Alpha Amplitude • The more participants reduced their alpha amplitude during NFB and the stronger their alpha "rebound", the greater the increase in SN connectivity with the right insula 

00:24:00
RUTH LANIUS And what we also was that the left dorsal anterior cingulate came on line which is an area important in attention. We also found that the more participants reduced their alpha during neurofeedback, the stronger their alpha rebound was so the stronger their increase in alpha after the neurofeedback and this related to a greater increase in, ah, salience network connectivity with the right insula. So the more rebound they had, the more they decrease their alpha and the more of the insula region connected in the salience network which may reflect an increased ability for interoceptive awareness which we have to measure in future studies. We also look at the relationship between changes in salience network connectivity and calmness and what we've found was an increase report of calmness after the neurofeedback was associated with an increase in salience network connectivity with both sides of the insula. Now, when we, ah, focus our attention to the, to the default mode network, we found increased connectivity in the default mode network in the subgenual cingulate which is right here which is an area really important in self-referential processing as well as in the left middle frontal gyrus. So it seems to start to bring on line some of the areas that are part of the default mode network. We also saw that the stronger the alpha rebound so the more they increase in alpha after the neurofeedback, the stronger the de-- default mode network connectivity with the left precuneus right here and the left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. And if you remember that really disconnect the default mode network in our patients with chronic early life trauma, I think this is really exciting that, you know, this treatment may be one means of helping people to increase that network connectivity and may be normalize that network. We also found that an increase in calmness was associated with enhance connectivity with the dis-- ah, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. So the more calm people felt, the greater increases in connectivity in this network we observed. So in summary then, the alpha rhythm decrease neurofeedback was associated with reduced alpha amplitude during neurofeedback but was hold by increased alpha baseline rebound. 

00:26:45
Summary ► Alpha rhythm desynchronizing NFB was associated with reduced alpha amplitude during NFB followed by increased baseline alpha synchronization ("rebound") ► Significant pre-to-post NFB differences were found in functional connectivity within the SN and DMN ► Changers in network connectivity were predicted by changes in alpha amplitude and calmness 

00:26:45
RUTH LANIUS And we found significant pre-deposed, ah, neurofeedback differences in both the default mode network as well as the salience network and these were related both to feelings of calmness as well as the EEG changes. So where do we go from here? When I currently, ah, able to say that these changes in the PTSD group are really due to the neurofeedback because we didn't have that sham control group and we didn't include that for ethical reasons because there are some evidence that once you do sham neurofeedback, people may not be able to benefit from real neurofeedback. And I think what we really need to focus on next is, ah, to explore whether the observed short-term changes generalized really longer turn-- time scales and we're just, ah, starting a randomized controlled trial, ah, looking at alpha-down neurofeedback or heart rate variability training to see whether we can maintain those changes after 20 sessions of treatment. And then I think we also need to think increasingly about the relationship between mechanisms underlying mindfulness meditation as well as this alpha neurofeedback training. But imagine the possibilities, you know, maybe through the combined use of these treatments that we can start to bring on line this very disrupted default mode network and really transform the sense of self. 

00:28:05
A Case Example: Using Mindfulness/Meditation (Body Scans) and Alpha Rhythm Neurofeedback to Work with a Fragmented Self 

00:28:05
RUTH LANIUS And this is what I wanna end with today is really show you a woman who is in my practice who was recently discharged where we used a lot of mindfulness meditation body scans and in combination with alpha rhythm neurofeedback to work with the very fragment of sense of self. She's now integrated, she's able have the capacity, filled with joy, and, ah, is able to carry on with her life. This is a body she did when she was very dissociated and you can see she experiences her brain is outside her skull, she doesn't have a nose, she doesn't have a mouth, she feels like her heart in her chest, she feels like he stomach is in her heart, she experiences all her organs as outside her body, she feels that both her hands are disconnected and both her feet are disconnected. So we were able to get an EEG of her in this state of mind and, ah, anybody who's, ah, experienced reading EEGs will see that she has a lot of slow wave activity both alpha and theta throughout her brain which is very unusual and probably contributes to this cognitive slowing and the symptoms of dissociation. 

00:29:15
Patient EEG 1 Compared to Normative Database 

00:29:15
RUTH LANIUS And when we compare her EEG in the state-- to a normative database, we've seen significant increased alpha as well as theta, so those slower waves that have been, ah, postulated to be associated with dissociation. So now, she just had about 9 years of psychotherapy so she's had, you know, a significant amount of, of psychotherapy and we did repeated, you know, a variety of techniques, repeated body scans and I was always able to get her out of that state of dissociation using, you know, beginning with body sensations then doing some ego-state work but she would always slip back into that disconnected state. And so Tomas came to the lab and he started using this alpha-down training and so she received four sessions of this alpha-down training neurofeedback. And we, we did her EEG and she still has some alpha abnormality but significantly less, right. So her slow waves have significantly reduced and she looks much more like somebody from the normative database. And this is how she depicts herself now, right. So she now has a face, she smiles, her hands and her feet are connected and she's wearing a karate outfit which actually is a real resource for her, you know, engaging in karate made her feel much safer in the world. So I wanna end with the quote of one of our patients, what he said after the MRI scan and the neurofeedback. He said, "It's like someone has gone into my brain and put the things back together. It's like someone has made some connections. By the end of it I felt more in control, I don't feel as out of it, I feel more together," thank you.
