DOUGLAS FOSTER Hello and welcome to Interchange. My guest today is Claude Steele, Professor of Psychology. Since 1991, Steele has been a Professor of Psychology at Stanford University. He is a member of the Board of Directors of the American Psychological Society and president elect at the Western Psychological Association. For the past seven years, Steele has focused his research on subtle and not so subtle forms of discrimination. In research studies at Stanford and at the University of Michigan, Steele and his colleagues discovered how stereotypes can affect academic achievement. Two recently published papers based on this research are bound to give ammunition to both sides in the affirmative action debate. Let's start there, Professor Steele. Uh, the affirmative action debate is in full throttle now. What's it like to try to say something complicated when everybody's shouting? 

00:01:10
CLAUDE STEELE It's been frustrating. It's not a, uh, the feelings are high around this issue, and so it's hard to inject something that, uh, is factual and, uh, pragmatic and, uh, somewhat complicated for, for, uh, quick, uh, packaging and, and sound bites. And so, that, that side of things has been difficult. 

00:01:30
DOUGLAS FOSTER You've said in The New York Times, uh, opinion piece that you wrote that, uh, the affirmative action debate has become disembodied from the facts. Your research is in the area of stereotype vulnerability and disif-, identification, two, two complicated nuanced concepts. Explain those briefly. 

00:01:50
CLAUDE STEELE PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY STANFORD UNIVERSITY 

00:01:50
CLAUDE STEELE Okay. Uh, that's good. I, it's good to sort of at the beginning of this, get the psychology out on the table and then we can, uh, go into the other issues. Um, stereotype vulnerability is a kind of, uh, 50 cent academic term for something that I think is quite simple and th-, and that has, eh, eh, is a part of almost everybody's experience. It's really being in any kind of situation where you could be judged by a negative stereotype about some group that you're a part of. Uh, I can think of trivial examples. For example, uh, if you're a part of a group that is seen as cold or insensitive. When you're in situations where the display of affect and emotion is sort of, uh, uh, what's going on in that situation. You're vulnerable. You have a sort of extra, uh, uh, uh, tension, maybe self consciousness about not conforming to stereotypes in, in your group. Uh, i-, it's, it's kind of a, a subcase of general reputational vulnerability. You know that certain people th-, uh, think of you in a particular way and so, when you're with those people, there's a certain extra self consciousness, extra tension around, uh, your conduct and so on. 

00:03:00
DOUGLAS FOSTER So, this is a vulnerability that can affect anybody. 

00:03:00
CLAUDE STEELE It, it can affect everybody and I'm trying to start out with examples of, of that. But in situations where the stereot-, when the stereotype is very negative, uh, and it, uh, pertains, it's relevant to very important situations, like academic performance or in a case of women, performance in mathematics. Then, this kind of vulnerability stops being the kind of trivial, m-, or more trivial, uh, uh, phenomenon. It becomes a very serious one. Uh, l-, let's take the case of women in mathematics. That's probably, uh, uh, one that a lot of people in the audience will, will be able to connect to. Uh, but there is a stereotype in American society that women are not as good at mathematics as, uh, men are. And so, whenever women are in situations where they're experiencing frustration over mathematics, uh, they are vulnerable in the sense of that term that I'm using. They are vulnerable to stereo-, to judgments based on the stereotype. They could be judged that way, treated in terms of the stereotype, they're even at risk of fulfilling the stereotype in their own, in their own eyes, and this, this creates a tension, which in the short run can actually interfere with their performance at mathematics in, in the middle of a standardized test, taking a very challenging, uh, uh, test, uh, start to have frustration at that, unlike the case for men in that situation. For women in that situation, a stereotype, uh, rears its head in the sense of, of adding a more disturbing meaning to that frustration. It makes it a more threatening, self-threatening situation. The resulting anxiety can interfere with their performance, and that's one of the, the phenomenon our research shows in th-, that in fact it does interfere with performance. 

00:04:35
DOUGLAS FOSTER DIRECTOR, STANFORD NEWS SERVICE STANFORD UNIVERSITY 

00:04:40
DOUGLAS FOSTER Now, are you saying that that kind of stereotype vulnerability can affect the performance of women on standardized tests, say, in mathematics or African Americans and might explain the difference in performance on standardized tests? 

00:04:50
CLAUDE STEELE Yes. Uh, one of the more controversial parts of social corners of social science is comparing groups on standardized test performance with the implication being that we're comparing groups on intelligence, or if, at least an important form of intelligence. An implication of our research is that part of the differences that are pointed to in there, the fact that women on advanced mathematic, uh, curriculum and, and, and, and difficult math tests tend to perform somewhat less than, well than men or that African Americans tend to perform less well than Whites in standardized test performance. Some of that could be due to the stereotype vul-, the effect is stereotype vulnerability that we're, uh, documenting in our research. 

00:05:30
DOUGLAS FOSTER Now, as I understand it, your research about seven years ago, began by looking at the experience of African American students at the University of Michigan and finding that it was the best prepared African American students there who are most likely to drop out. That must have come as a shock. 

00:05:50
CLAUDE STEELE That was. I, I had, I think had the stereotype, uh, if you'll allow me that term, that most people had that the under performance of African Americans in, in, uh, college, uh, really throughout America, that that was due to under preparation, that it was an outgrowth of general, uh, historical, uh, and ongoing, uh, disadvantage in American society, that that disadvantage was leading to an under preparation that was contributing to their, uh, lower performance on tests and in grade, grades as well. And what was surprising is exactly what you noted, that, uh, that isn't the case, that under performance, uh, is as powerful at the f-, among students who were very well prepared as indicated by, for example, very high SAT scores as it was for students who were less prepared. So th-, that was the phenomenon that drew me into this problem and, uh, uh, suggested that maybe psychology was relevant to the situation. 

00:06:45
DOUGLAS FOSTER You also found, I think that, certain kinds of affirmative action programs then in place at the University of Michigan racialized the experience for minority students and in fact maybe made the situation worse or, or, or was not a solution at the very least. 

00:07:00
CLAUDE STEELE Yes. I, I always want to begin by saying I think these programs are well intended and I, myself, uh, uh, fought for the development of, of these programs on several campuses but I think one down side that they have is the, uh, sort of, uh, reification of negative stereotypes about the groups, these groups' abilities. And the, uh, particulars of the situation don't really justify it. I think a lot of people don't understand. Uh, they hear about affirmative action so much and how it's such a concession to minority students that they think all minority students are there b-, therefore unqualified for, for college. This isn't true. Uh, very few c-, uh, universities and min-, minority students beneath the standard of admissions for other students. So, for every, uh, minority student on a campus like, say, Stanford's, there are several white students with, uh, comparable, uh, SAT scores and high school grades and so on. Uh, where, uh, uh, affirmative action enters the picture is that among a set of qualified students , race might add enough of an advantage as a consideration, admissions consideration to allow them to be more likely to be accepted but it isn't the case that these students are really under prepared for, for college work. Uh, so, the problems lie elsewhere. They, they lie in how the students are, are treated and conceptualized I think by the institution. The, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, this, this is perhaps less relevant to Stanford than it is other, uh, uh, campuses that I'm fam-, familiar with but, because Stanford doesn't have the same kinds of, uh, programs but they're, uh, uh, per-, perhaps the mode across the country is to treat these students with, uh, programs that are in a sense remediation programs. So, that links being a minority with a need for remediation in the image work of a, of a campus and that r-, that, that reifies the very stereotypes that I'm talking about. So, when a, uh, for example, a black student arrives on campus, uh, and has that first moment of frustration, gets a C minus when they were us-, when they're used to B pluses and As, uh, in the context of that kind of treatment, it verifies the stereotype th-, or the suspicion that the university, uh, by dent of these programs holds them under. It, it gives credibility to, to inability as the source of their frustration and it makes the whole thing a more daunting experience for them. 

00:09:20
DOUGLAS FOSTER S-, some critics of affirmative action, including your brother, Shelby, use those kinds of examples affirmative, affirmative action programs that focus on remediation, uh, they say these programs deepen the sense of stigma, actually stigmatize minority students more. Why don't you agree with that logic? 

00:09:40
CLAUDE STEELE Well, the, uh, the most critical distinction is, is between the policy itself and the implementation of the policy. Uh, the fact of the policy, uh, uh, and maybe I'll get back to that, to, to describe how, how policy really works in a bit but uh, it's the implementation that, that I'm, uh, concerned about here through primarily minority remediation programs on campus. That is where I think most of the damage is, is done and that is a fixable feature of, of the way affirmative action is implemented. 

00:10:10
DOUGLAS FOSTER How is it fixable? 

00:10:10
CLAUDE STEELE Well, that, before affirmative action was in jeopardy, uh, a number of years ago, when I was teaching at the University of Michigan, I got involved in beginning a program that really was just designed to, how can you do affirmative action the right way? If it, if it's got, if it's got the problem that you've just described, how can you fix it? Well, you fix it by in many ways, getting rid of this remediation notion and delinking that with, uh, with the student's minority status and you, you do that at, through, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, a number of pretty simple strategies. Challenging them, for example, giving them very demanding work rather than remediation. Uh, throughout the country, programs that do this have very dramatic successes with minority students and, and now having, having done this work for four years, I'm, I, we get dramatic results that really surprised me. I never anticipated getting as strong results as we've been able to get. 

00:11:00
DOUGLAS FOSTER Let's, let's get into that in some detail because I think many people looking at the global nature of the problem, the gap between the number of African American students going to college, the 70% dropout rate among African American students once they get there assume that the major problem, or the key problem is lack of preparation, under preparation. You're saying something else is at work here. 

00:11:20
CLAUDE STEELE Yes. That's a good distinction. I, I wanna make a distinction from preparation. I think preparation contributes to some degree, but the largest problem they face is, is this problem, this is based on my own research, so, so that, that is the, the sort of foundation on which I'm making this, this kind of argument. My, my, based on that, is, is it the, the problem really stems from this vulnerability that they experience on campus and the way that vulnerability is, is institutionalized in, in, in their treatment on campus. I mean, a lot of, uh, uh, uh, of Americans I don't think understand the special ways that have evolved to treat minority students, that, that, that they're recruited on the basis of their minority identities, they're offered special summer programs, they are offered special remediation programs once they get there, and so there's a whole failings of things. 

00:12:10
DOUGLAS FOSTER Wh-, what was the first contact that a student, for example, who used to be accepted for admission at University of, uh, Michigan get, uh, uh, white students got a letter that said, uh, "Congratulations for, for, uh, achieving this distinction of being admitted," and minority students got a, got a different kind of letter previously, didn't they? 

00:12:30
CLAUDE STEELE Yeah. They often get, and this is true for many, uh, uh, campuses, that, that they often get letters, uh, saying "We're very committed to having minority students on campus, and so that we're very interested in having you apply," or "We're very happy that you were admitted," but in some way in the letter, uh, the insinuating that their minority status was a substantial part of their, of the admissions decision, um, when often it isn't, when often it's a very, very minor part of, uh, of their ad-, admissions decision. Uh, so, it is these kind of treatments that I think, in a sense, undermine their confidence when they get there, undermine their resilience to academic stress, so that when they get the same stresses that other people get because of the, the suspicion they're under and the stereotype they're under, uh, those frustrations verify a mu-, have a much more meaningful im-, uh, meaning to them and, and can be much more discouraging. And that is where I think we start to see these problems of, of, uh, persistence and performance that, uh, occur. 

00:13:35
DOUGLAS FOSTER Well, what happens is, uh, stereotype vulnerability takes its toll on a student over time. 

00:13:40
CLAUDE STEELE Uh, one thing that I think happens and this is sort of the second part of our theory is that, is, one adaptation is to withdraw identifying with the domain in which one experiences the vulnerability. Again, maybe w-, women make a good example of this, that, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, a motivated math student feeling this especially in college math courses and quantitative, uh, kinds of courses can get tired of it after awhile, and begin to seek alternative, uh, identities, alternative bases for, for, uh, their self esteem. Uh, in, in a sense withdraw a commitment to, uh, these areas where they're, where they're experiencing vulnerabilities, as a way of protecting against vulnerability. That, then, becomes a kind of chronic adaptation to the, to the situation and to the vulnerability which, um, if they land in another alternative identity that's a good one, then it's fine but, uh, if they don't then they've lost something because they've lost, uh, uh, uh, a commitment to, uh, an important domain of life. In a case of race, I think it's, it's even more dramatic because the stereotypes covers all areas where intellectual abilities is, is at issue, and so to withdraw from that, one has to withdraw to, uh, a set of domains in American life that are, uh, considerably more difficult to thrive in. 

00:15:00
DOUGLAS FOSTER Let's talk about the research itself, the, the t-, the testing part of the research itself that indicates to you that your theory is correct. The kind of testing situations you put both women in and African American and white students in that convinces you that this theory plays out. 

00:15:15
CLAUDE STEELE Again, I'll stick with the example of women in math, uh, though we have co-, comparable, uh, re-, experiments with, uh, African American students but, uh, we have them a very difficult math test. It's the difficulty of the test and it's the fact that they care about doing well at the test that makes them vulnerable. So, here they are, one at, one, uh, person at a time taking a very difficult, uh, test, items taken from the graduate record exam, slightly above their, their training. We have men, who we know have the same kind of preparation and ability do the same thing. And, but, in that situation we ex-, expect that for women, when they experience frustration, that the stereotype emerges. It ma-, it gives a greater meaning to that frustration. So, they feel as if, "Geez, I'm really confirming this is my water loo. Everybody suspects women of not having adequate math ability and finally I've reached my limit." That anxiety distracts them from the test and their performance goes down, and that's what happens in these kinds of experiments. 

00:16:15
DOUGLAS FOSTER DIRECTOR, STANFORD NEWS SERVICE STANFORD UNIVERSITY 

00:16:15
DOUGLAS FOSTER So let me make sure I've got this right. In a situation, same kinds of stat-, tests, same level of difficulty, if you signal to the person who's taking to the test something that sets off the stereotype vulnerability or the, the vulnerability to, to feeling, "I may, uh, in fact help give ammunition to people who hold this stereotype," uh, the performance is depressed but if you don't signal this, that kind of the, you don't activate the stereotype, the performance increases? Is equal? The gap is eliminated? 

00:16:50
CLAUDE STEELE PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY STANFORD UNIVERSITY 

00:16:50
CLAUDE STEELE Exactly. Exactly. That's the, that's the sort of good news of this research is that if you have that woman student take that test but you change the instructions, you change the meaning of the situation slightly by, for example, saying, "This is a test on which men alw-, women always do as well as men, it's been, it's always been this way so there are no gender differences on that test." Now, that student takes the test, experiences the same test, experiences the same kind of frustration but now is not vulnerable to confirming the stereotype because this is a test, uh, on which women always do as well as men, so there is no gender interpretation of performance on this particular test. So, she's in a sense, in this situation, protected from verifying that stereotype, and lo and behold, her, their, her, their performance starts to match that of, of men. And it's that, it's that way, it's that kind of evidence to which we are able to infer the existence of this phenomenon of stereotype vulnerability. 

00:17:45
DOUGLAS FOSTER Okay. Now you've not only done this testing research but you've tried out some of the ideas on the field. There's, uh, the 21st Century Program at the University of Michigan. What are the results there? 

00:18:00
CLAUDE STEELE That program is an attempt to take these principles we find in the laboratory and to apply them in the real world to see if they have weight in the real world, and, uh, after four years of doing that I can say with, with, as, as much confidence as any researcher can say, it works. Uh, strategies that, uh, in, in a sense deflect these, the stereotype vulnerability, this beast we're talking about here, uh, result in very dramatic gains in, uh, minority student, ac-, academic achievement and persistence in, in school. Um, uh. 

00:18:30
DOUGLAS FOSTER Uh, tell us, uh, something about those results. What, uh, what's been accomplished? It's been, uh, four years, uh, in existence now so you've got, uh, uh, a long run of, uh, uh, of results or, or at least a full class through it? 

00:18:50
CLAUDE STEELE Yes. Yes. Yeah. We have. We've been able to follow one group, th-, the program lasts only for their freshman year but they, we've been able to follow the first group all the way through the, f-, four years of college, and, uh, have a very dramatic persistence rate. 92% of them, uh, um, persist, ei-, either graduate or c-, continue to enroll. Uh, also, we, a-, am-, among the black students in this program, I should say i-, in the way of, uh, descriptions of program, that it's a t-, it's a totally integrated program. There are 250 students in it. Uh, they're roughly in the same ethnic proportions as the rest of Michigan, University of Michigan's campus. So there are 40 blacks in the program, 40 non-black minorities. The rest are white students. It's presented to families as a transition program, something to help, uh, students engage this large university they're coming into. And people are very enthusiastic about having their kids, uh, participate in it. The students have to agree to be in very challenging academic, uh, workshops attached to some, uh, a course, either physics, chemistry, writing, calculus. Uh, and then they have, uh, weekly seminars where they get to talk about things. That really, that goes on for their first year. They live together in a wing of a dormitory, and that's really what the, the, the program is. The things that, uh, we think are, uh, effective about it, uh, is I think in particular, this challenge notion. Uh, when you're w-, working on something that's very difficult and you experience frustration, uh, then it's due to, th-, the challenge you're facing. It's not due to some inadequacy on your own part. And when you see other people struggling with the same kind of challenge that reduces the, the, the, the inference. It doesn't make it as plausible that you're the problem. It makes it clear that the difficulty of the work is the problem. And that, that's protects these kids from the kind of vulnerabilities that I'm, uh, I'm talking about. Also, for example, throughout the program, a theme is that intelligence is expandable. You can, th-, the harder you work, the smarter you get. That, then when you have a frustration you're not confirming or sort of limiting an ability. You're confirming that you need to work harder. So, these kinds of themes throughout, concerted in this program produce very dramatic gains in, uh, the academic performance of these students. 

00:21:00
DOUGLAS FOSTER So, did the extent that this program describes good affirmative action as opposed to the kind of affirmative action that has been widely criticized, what are the key elements of its success? 

00:21:10
CLAUDE STEELE Yeah. Uh, again, I think, th-, the key element i-, th-, the problem with the way affirmative action has been implemented, the primary problem is this linking of, of a need for remediation with the-, a minority's identity. It reifies larger stereotypes that are out there in the society, and every time that student's flubs a question, stubs their, their toe academically, it verifies this, this sort of crushing, uh, uh, stereotype th-, that's out there and it makes going through college a more difficult struggle for them. What our program does is to, to, to deflect that as much as possible. It affirms their potential. Uh, it puts them in academic situations where frustration doesn't have that kind of stereotype verifying meaning. And in these ways, wh-, when we can concert this, the, the way we do, uh, it, it, you see dramatic gains in academic achievement. So, with this kind of experience in our research, I've gotten to be quite hopeful about, uh, the appropriate use of affirmative action. Uh, we can come back to the larger policy issues about when it should be fair, how big a program it should be, and so on. But whether or not the program can work or not, this kind of experience has given me a lot of hope. 

00:22:20
DOUGLAS FOSTER Well, under proposed legislation to outlaw the use of, uh, consideration of race in either admissions or hiring, I assume such a program would be illegal. 

00:22:30
CLAUDE STEELE Yes, because in our program, we, th-, w-, we, this program is attached to an admissions policy, an admissions procedure which does consider race, and so, um, uh, it would be illegal by, by for example, what the u-, the intent I suppose of the UC Berkeley Regents' ruling recently. Uh, that would be unfortunate because I b-, I believe that, uh, and this sort of gets us out of th-, the, the research now into the larger question of, of, of rationale for affirmative action, but I s-, I think there are still, uh, structural disadvantages in this society that, that, that isolate certain groups. In particular, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, from the stream of resources and contacts, and networks, uh, that, that contribute to mo-, mobility, education mobility, and, and other kinds of mobility in society. I think that, that, that these groups are isolated from that stream enough that a small, effective affirmative action program is still appropriate, justified, and, and, uh, needed. 

00:23:30
DOUGLAS FOSTER In a recent piece in The New Yorker, um, Michael Kinsley wrote that the only thing affirmative action accomplishes, is it, is that it gives white males whining rights, what he called whining rights in the victimization bizarre. How do you think it's going to be possible to explain the importance of well crafted affirmative action programs when there's such a widespread, uh, perception that, that affirmative action that uses race as a consideration is un-, unfair? 

00:24:00
CLAUDE STEELE Yeah. This is, it, it is unfortunate because this is where f-, uh, sort of the debate and the ideologies and the debate is an occasion for ideological discussion and conflict has sort of departed from the facts of the situation. I'm most familiar with affirmative action at the college level. And, uh, the, the data that are relevant here suggests that affirmative action's a very small kind of program. It opens the aperture for minority students only just a slight bit for students with a special initiative to sort of get through the system. It's not the kind of massive, uh, program that it's stereotyped to be in these, uh, um, in these debates. Uh, so, the, the, question of whining rights for, uh, for, uh, white Americans, I, I, I, I, I, I want to in every way be sympathetic to, to, um, uh, any injustices that they might experience in, in, uh, in this domain. I, I wouldn't want to, to, to put those down but I think the facts of the matter, people could really look at the facts of the matter, they would see that the cost is very small. Uh, for example, uh, you, th-, the, the Westwood, you know, where affirmative action is really happening on a campus, is to know whether minority students and, uh, uh, among students who are equally qualified, are minorities more likely to get in than, than, um, majority students, white students? When you look at that across the country, uh, affirmative action only exists in the top, uh, schools, the top 15% of schools, schools where the s-, where the average SAT level is above 1,100. The, 85% of the c-, of the, of the, of the four year colleges in the United States have no evidence of, of affirmative action in the sense I just described in, and among those elite schools, uh, black students, for example, don't often take advantage of the admissions preference that they, uh, get. They preferring to go to schools that are closer to their homes, or that are historically black universities and so on. So, in fact, they make up only about, uh, 5 to 7% of the student body of most elites, uh, uh, colleges and the univer-, in the United States. So these programs are very small. Many of those, many of that 7% would get in no matter what policy you, you, you had. Uh, so, the extra opening in its aperture, I don't believe in fact is causing the kind of, uh, distress that most Americans would be concerned about. When you consider the backdrop i-, of, of, of the history of our, of our nation, whether it just be these continuing structural disadvantages that some g-, groups, uh, uh, have to bear. 

00:26:25
DOUGLAS FOSTER Well, as a social scientist, what are the, uh, what are the big troubling questions that you move onto next in this area? 

00:26:30
CLAUDE STEELE Well, I, I'm particularly interested in how to do it, uh, side of things. Uh, how do you, uh, structure schooling so that it benefits everybody, but at the same time is wise, that's a term we use with regard to, uh, minority students. Uh, America has pa-, pa-, pa-, particularly difficult educational challenge, which is, it has to educate a very heterogeneous society. Other societies, where the populations are more homogeneous, I think have an easier time of it, but in America, we have to educate a diverse set of people in very simil-, in, in the same classrooms. And the, the question is, "How do you do that effectively?" And I would like to having begun with this research on stereotype vulnerability and disidentification and so on, uh, extrapolate that into hard, concrete strategies for schooling that would help people cope with that, uh, educational diversity. 

00:27:25
DOUGLAS FOSTER Well, sad to say, we're out of time. Thank you, Claude Steele, for joining us today. 

00:27:30
CLAUDE STEELE It's a pleasure.
