RICH SIMON Welcome, everyone. My name's Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker. I'm your host for this webcast series on the six biggest challenges that therapists face, and today, we're gonna start off at the, a universal experience. I'm quite that this is an experience everyone listening to this webcast has had. We're gonna be talking about when therapy stalls. This is not i-, uh, one of our more dramatic sessions about dealing with a borderline client or the narcissistic client. We're talking about when therapy bogs out and nothing seems to be happening, and we are very fortunate to have, as our guest for this conversation, uh, a great friend of Psychotherapy Networker, someone who's uh, part of a number of these webcasts, uh, and we welcome you to the webcast Bill Doherty. Bill, how are you? 

00:01:10
WILLIAM DOHERTY I, I'm great, great. Rich, I'm just thinking about I'm the bog master here or something, you know, the stall master. That's uh, an interesting uh, expertise I have here. 

00:01:20
RICH SIMON All right, yes, well, you're like the Dean Smith when, when they, the old North Carolina (ph)teams used to go into the stall. 

00:01:25
WILLIAM DOHERTY There you go. 

00:01:25
RICH SIMON (inaudible ) With 10 minutes to go in the college game. So, um, well, let's talk about this. So, so, it's, it's, in our previous discussion, one of the things you've, you have said about yourself is that you're, some therapists like long-term therapy, people come back week after week, they have a nice chat with their clients, they fi-, find there's nothing wrong with that. There's something, uh, in our previous conversation you've indicated you're constitutionally, that doesn't quite fit you, so let's, why, why is this an issue? So maybe sometimes (crosstalk)therapy is slow, people take a long time to change. Why, (crosstalk)what's the rush? 

00:02:05
WILLIAM DOHERTY (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah, well, I, I'm really um, not talking about long vs. short-term therapy. I mean, I've seen some clients for years, and others are short, so it isn't really a question of length. It's a question of whether there's still momentum, whether there's still work going on. Um, uh, but, but there may be some people, like if, if you're dealing with, say you're at a community mental health center and you have somebody who's dealing with schizophrenia. I mean, may, maybe you're just supporting them so that they're not in an institution, and that's fine; that's work. I'm really talking about the situation in which somebody has come with a problem to address. You, you have a good clinical relationship, they have made headway, and they've stopped making headway, okay, um, uh, and so maybe you're in that kind of middle phase of therapy and um, uh, but they keep coming back and they're seem like they would come back forever, uh, but there's not much happening. That's what I'm talking about, so it's really got nothing to do with length or, or just um, or whether some therapist like to do short-term, cuz you could like to do short-term work and stall out in the fifth session of 10, so that's really what I'm talking about, when uh, when the, the main ingredients we talk about in successful therapy, like a good clinical relationship, you're able to structure the sessions, there's a clear problem at work and all that sort of stuff. "No, not much has happened." That's what I'm talking about. 

00:03:35
RICH SIMON Okay, so, so as you, when you get to that point and the indicator, to you, of getting to that point is . . . 

00:03:50
WILLIAM DOHERTY Yeah, that, that, um, that, the problems that the client is talking about, um, aren't changing, and their effort towards changing those is not that great. You know, it might be an individual kind of coming and complaining about their mother or marriage or something like that and they're, they make some headway but they've stopped and they're basically going over and over their familiar complaints. Uh, maybe they've even gotten to see their own part better, but you have the feeling that, or you have, in the clear sense, that in between sessions, they're not actually working that much, but they're coming in and having a nice chat with you . . . 

00:04:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:04:30
WILLIAM DOHERTY . . . uh, and um, and experientially, for the therapist, you start to get kind of bored. 

00:04:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, okay. 

00:04:40
WILLIAM DOHERTY "We've been over this and over this." Um, however, there's a kind of an inertia that sets in. You know, in medicine they talk about clinical inertia; they just sort of keeping rolling along, you stay the course, they're paying their bills - okay? - um, uh, and these are the, these are the couples we don't bring up in case consultation that much, right?, because there's nothing dramatic happening with them. They're just sort of . . . They kind of fill a space in your schedule, but there's a, there's a question that I'm proposing to, uh, my colleagues and myself of whether this is a good use of human resources at some point? Okay? Whether it's a good use of our time or that's a good use of their time and money or whether it's a good use of the insurance system that's being paid, because if therapy is about change and growth and problem-solving, and that's not happening, um, you know, maybe we should address it, and that's, that's, that's what we'll talk about, but if we get into an inertia because it's, we're not terribly uncomfortable and they're not terribly uncomfortable any more, um, it's not the best use of therapy time. 

00:05:55
RICH SIMON Okay, all right. So, uh, when you get to that point and you can, you feel it in your and you're doing this for a year or two now, you've been doing some therapy for a while, so you have a sense of this, so how do you begin to frame this kind of an issue? How do you think about your role and how you're gonna, uh, respond to this situation and, perhaps, get the therapy moving again? 

00:06:20
WILLIAM DOHERTY Well, I wanna begin with how not to do it. 

00:06:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:06:25
WILLIAM DOHERTY I always, I always prefer to begin with mistakes . . . 

00:06:25
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:06:25
WILLIAM DOHERTY . . . right, because we've all done them, we've all been there, and the, and the default path I'm suggesting, if we don't have our wits about us, is to make mistakes, and we don't (ph)necessary no mistakes, so, so one of them is that you find yourself bored, uh, you find yourself annoyed that the person has sort of gone over and over the same stuff, um, and so you shift from a mostly supportive mode you've been in for some time, to, all of a sudden, the poor client, you know, you lean towards them and you say, "You know, I don't think you've looked closely enough at your unhappiness in your marriage?", okay, like, where the heck did that happen, and it's the, often the therapist is, is um, would feel better if the person actually uh, was um, uh, in more pain in their marriage at this point, cuz then they would be more stuff for us to work with, so you move into a, a, a, uh, you do a sudden shift, uh, towards, uh, challenging that person, okay, um, and um, and they, they assume you had a bad day or something, you know? I mean, they . . . "What the heck is happening (crosstalk)here?" 

00:07:50
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)"Where'd this come from," (crosstalk)yeah. 

00:07:50
WILLIAM DOHERTY (crosstalk)"Where'd this come from?" And maybe it's because you did a consultation, uh, about the case and you're, you're now feeling like you're not a good enough therapist . . . 

00:08:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:08:00
WILLIAM DOHERTY . . . so you come in with what your colleague and case consultation thought, you know . . . 

00:08:05
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:08:05
WILLIAM DOHERTY . . . some big new interpretation, some big new challenge. The other, the other mis- . . . And it just throws the client, you know? You haven't set it up, um, um, and um, you know, I'd like to tell this story of uh, uh, with a, with, uh, a family I wasn't doing that well with and I, I, I saw Salvador Minuchin work, you know, so I made the second mistake: I come back in with a new technique. I saw Salvador Minuchin beat up the father in this family who loved it and they, they changed, so I come back and I beat up the father, you know, (crosstalk)and I still . . . 

00:08:40
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Salvador (ph)authority. 

00:08:40
WILLIAM DOHERTY Yeah, and I still remember him looking at me. His eyes got wide, like, "What got into you?", uh, and uh, and the next week I apologized and we, you know, we moved on, but, but, but the second thing is that trying out a new technique. So, um, this is a case that, that I consulted on. The uh, uh, the uh, wife had had a series of affairs, couple come in for therapy, the wife kinda (ph)owned some part of this, did some good work, uh, the husband understood that, but he, he was stuck on, um, he couldn't get over her affairs and he was obsessing about it and um, and uh, he had made the mistake of, of insisting on reading some of her e-mails to the other man and that was stuck in his head, and so the therapist was doing everything she could. These people came back to therapy. They really appreciated the therapist, but he was, you know, wasn't going anywhere with it. He was sort of, just kind of in the, in the soup about it, and so the therapist said, "Why don't we try EMDR?", and it kind of came out of the blue, it kind of came out of the blue, and um, so all of a sudden, after a year and a half of we're, we're, we're just talking, um, the therapist is coming in, you know, the, the very next session with uh, you know, her hand movements, and uh, the client - he talked to me later about it - he was a little befuddled, uh, so, uh, and it didn't work, and I think it probably didn't work because, uh, I'm guessing that the therapist, uh, was pulling a rabbit out of a hat like, "Okay, let's just try something. Let's, let's try hypnosis! Let's try EMDR!" cuz, you know, "I'm gonna get you unstuck!" uh, and so the, the two mistakes that we would tend to make are to suddenly up the ante of intensity of the work, coming from our impatience, or trying a new technique, uh, uh, and those tend not to work. 

00:10:50
RICH SIMON Yeah, okay, all right, so, uh, and, and so those are the two classic, the, the most, the most uh, glaring missteps that someone can take in this (ph)juncture, so what's, uh . . . So, shifting then, if we can, to . . . So how do you, in your work, things sort of stall down, nothing's happening, people coming week after week . . . Before moving immediately into a new intervention or pulling a rabbit out of the hat, what's the process that you go through? 

00:11:25
WILLIAM DOHERTY Yeah, well, what I go through is to, um, to decide before a session that I'm gonna put something on the agenda,uh, to talk about, um, where a client is now terms of dealing with the problems that came with them, the goals that they had, so, so I don't do it as a, uh, response to, you know, we're halfway through a session and the client says, "I don't know if this is ever gonna get better," and then, you know, the therapist's heart sinks. That's not the time to say, "So, tell me: do you think this therapy is working?" Right? Rather, what I go in with that agenda, so I'll usually ask clients what they wanna work on today and then I will add one and then I'll say, "So I'd like to put something on the agenda. I'd like to . . ." - and I'm gonna read what I say here, cuz the words (ph)are (ph)important . . . 

00:12:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:12:20
WILLIAM DOHERTY . . . um, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh . . . "I'd like to spend some time in this session looking at where you are now in terms of the problems that you came in with to therapy, the goals that you came in with, so, um, uh, to talk about where, where you think you are with, with those, those issues you can," so I spend a little time on that, uh, and so then we carve out some time; maybe there's something a little more emergent that we start with, and then we switch to that, so I'm putting on the table an evaluation, uh, of, uh, of how they see their progress. The other thing I do with that, and this is something that I, um, that I really like to do to make it about our work and not just about, "So how are you doing?", okay? Uh, first thing is "How you doing?", but then I'll often shift into, "So, where, where do you think we are in terms of our work together here?" Um, another thing I'll ask from people is, um, "Do you . . ." - in terms of the arc of our work - "Do you see us as in a winding down phase? Cuz you've clearly made some progress. Do you see us as the middle phase, or, you know, not yet the middle . . . I mean, where do you see us, in terms of a, the arc or trajectory of our work?" And I find that a very helpful question because it's stepping back; it's not, you know, threatening to stop but it, it suggests that there are phases and that those ought to be tied to the work that we're here to do, um, and um, uh, and then the third thing I do, uh, is, uh, if, uh, I'll, I'll often use a word like plateau, in our work, um, so I will, so here's some e-, some words I might use: "So, as I've been thinking about our work, it seems to me that, that the significant changes you made came early in our work, that, that you got onto it, you, uh, came to grips with some of the kind of self-defeating thoughts and attitudes you had, your relationship improved, um, and uh, as I've been thinking about our work, and I'm interested in your perspective on this, we've kinda reached a plateau of, of what looks to me like real change and progress and growth." And then, "for a while, we've been sort of, in our work, at that plateau, uh, maintaining but not, not, not, no new breakthroughs and new strides, and so I'm interested in any of your reflections you have about that," okay? So I'm inviting the person to think about their growth and progress and our work together and uh, uh, uh, to, to open up that conversation in a way that isn't pejorative, that isn't reactive on my part. That's not saying, um, "You're not doing well enough," so a word like plateau . . . Well, we all, you know, we all have plateaus, and then the question gets to be whether we're, we're gonna have a, uh, a, a focus on moving past this plateau, what new work, what's, what's left there, uh, uh, uh, (ph)averses, uh, it, it, it opens the conversation to whether they've done the work that they came to do for now. That's where I wanna go with it, but I wanna go with that, uh, prior to my being highly frustrated, or, if I am frustrated, to take, take us somewhere else so that we're having this very respectful conversation about the, the, the, the nature of our work and the progress of our work, and what, if anything, we're gonna do in the future. 

00:16:15
RICH SIMON Okay, so, given that, and this is something that, uh, sounds like you've uh, done for some time, is are there kind of different groups, kind of different categories of response that you get from your clients as you've, as you lay out the issue in the way that you've just described? 

00:16:40
WILLIAM DOHERTY Yeah, I think there are. There are, uh, I'm thinking, two categories, and a lot of my work, in recent years, has been with couples, so I'll think of couple, two examples there: uh, for some people, it's the, the, the, the wake-up call to start working on that they have been delaying, like their sexual relationship, okay? And we . . . They didn't wanna deal with that upfront and blah blah blah, and, and we haven't done it in our work, so rather than me saying, "You know, there's something we haven't talked about here," um, which I could do, but the, the worry I have about doing that is then it puts me in the initiator role. So: "We haven't talked about your sexual relationship." Well, what if they go, "Yeah, what do you think we should do?" Right? 

00:17:25
RICH SIMON "You, you want us to have more sex now?" 

00:17:30
WILLIAM DOHERTY Yeah, he wants to have more sex. "Tell me more, why you want us to have . . ." You know? It just sort of flips it, um, whereas, um, when I, when I implicitly am suggesting that we could, we could wind down without dealing with that, that's implicit in that, cuz I'm, I'm affirming the good work that they've done at this plateau, um, I'm letting them come to me, and it's often one, not the other, saying, "Our intimacy, you know, our sexual intimacy has not improved that much, and that was one of the things I really wanted to work on when we came here, and I think we need some work on that, and I go, "Oh, okay. Tell me more about that." I turn to the other person. "What do you think about that?" So I'm inviting them to initiate. You know, Carl Whitaker talked about the battle for structure and the battle for initiative, and in some ways this stuck phase with people is about where the initiative is gonna come from, and, and if the therapist is too, like, "You're not dealing with this. Let me give you this interpretation. Let me try this, this uh, uh, trek," um, then the therapist is, uh, could be losing the battle for initiative . . . 

00:18:45
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:18:45
WILLIAM DOHERTY . . . implicitly, saying for me to good about what I'm doing, you gotta be doing well, whereas if I do what I'm talking about here, um, with . . . So one category is like, "Oh, okay. This therapy isn't going to go on forever. Maybe we should get to what we wanna work on." 

00:19:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:19:05
WILLIAM DOHERTY The other category is that people who have done all they're prepared to do now, and it's just recently that I put together in my, in my thinking, that um, that there's a category of couples that I've seen over the years who've come in in a crisis about something other than their direct relationship, like, like they have . . . I'm thinking of two couples I've seen in the recent past, uh, who had mentally ill adolescents and young adults and their parents were divided about how to ha-, how to handle them, and, of course, that was affecting their relationship, but what drove them to therapy was their co-parenting relationship and their worries about their kids and the emergencies with their kids, so, of course, that's where we started, and when, when that, when they got help there, they were functioning more as a team. Um, their, their kid was more stable. Um, uh, the therapy stalled, okay, because they said, "Yes. We also have these other issues. Our, our uh, our uh, you know, our intimate relationship, how much time we spend together, how much draw we have to each other, how we, you know, disagree about this or money or whatever," but when we get into it they, it was kind of, kind of intellectual. I mean, they, they, there wasn't, there wasn't the same heart in it that they had when it's around their child, so one of my notions about therapy and about change in life in general is that there has to be a pressure point. People have to, there has to be something gnawing at you to get out of the inertia of the relationship, and so, for these folks, we would (ph)meach, reach that middle phase, and I'd be feeling good about the, uh, about their relationship in terms of the co-parenting and a lot of pressure (ph)all and, and, and, and their stuck, so when I would talk about, with them, we'd review the progress they made and I would say, "In terms of the co-parenting, which is at the heart of what you brought here, it really looks like you made headway, and they feel proud about that, and then we reached a plateau, cuz when we worked on how you manage your relationship and you're getting closer to each other and dealing with conflict and blah blah blah, it seems like there's been less energy there, and that we kind of reached a plateau, and I'm interested in your thoughts about that." For them, there is often this, "Oh, good. That's right. We came for this piece of work. We need to do another piece of work at some other time, but, for now, I think, I think you're right. I think you're right. We just haven't, there hasn't been enough of a drive to improve those other parts of the relationships," and then it's like no shame, no blame - okay? - because I'm around; they can come back to work on that stuff in the future, and they can leave feeling good about the work they did as opposed to feeling like they disappointed me or they've not, they've not become a fully actualized couple. 

00:22:15
RICH SIMON Okay, so those are two, um, pretty straightforward responses: one, okay, here's an invitation to bring up something we haven't talked about before. "I'll take responsibility", says one client, or both clients, whoever, or, "Oh, okay. We're not really . . . I'm not up for moving further." Now, so that's . . . And those things both . . . Both of those seems like terrific, now do . . . What are the uh . . . There, there must be some problematic responses, like uh, there are you . . . For example, "What do you mean, Dr. Doherty? Do you think there's something that we should be working on that uh . . . Or is there something that should be happening in here that isn't happening?" or whatever else you get. Are there other kinds of response, out of those, those two, which sound to me very, um, helpful, both to you and to the client responses? 

00:23:10
WILLIAM DOHERTY Um, Minnesotans would never be that direct, Rich. I never get, get that, um . . . 

00:23:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:23:15
WILLIAM DOHERTY . . . please. Uh, uh, that's an East Coast question. 

00:23:15
RICH SIMON I see. 

00:23:15
WILLIAM DOHERTY Yeah, uh, um, the, the other category where there's more turbulence is when, uh, somebody thinks I'm threatening to abandon them. 

00:23:30
RICH SIMON Oh, okay. 

00:23:30
WILLIAM DOHERTY Okay. Um, uh, that uh, that they have termination fears, um, and uh, and that starts to come out, okay, and then we process that. 

00:23:45
RICH SIMON And h-, and what does that sound like? What kinds of things . . . 

00:23:45
WILLIAM DOHERTY I-, i-, what it sounds like . . . Um, "I don't know, I don't know if I could make it without this therapy. I don't know what would happen to our relationship if, if we weren't coming here," okay? That, that would be . . . Somebody does that, (crosstalk)um, and then, boy, then that's great. I mean, in other words, we're not plateauing at that point; we're doing work! 

00:24:05
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah, (crosstalk)yeah. 

00:24:05
WILLIAM DOHERTY (crosstalk)Okay? So you deal with that with whatever. I mean, there are, you know, abandonment issues as a kid, if you wanna go there; um, uh, issues of dependency and autonomy. Um, sometimes it allows me to, to honestly say that um, uh, that I, uh, I, I wanna be uh, work with this person or this couple as long as this work is productive; uh, on the other hand, I don't anticipate us, uh, being in the nursing home together, with me still their therapist, you know, and so part of the nature of this work is to be aiming for them to, uh, have me as a uh, as somebody who's a part-time consultant, um, and um, uh, and so we, we get into really talking about our relationship, their fears, and the nature of our work, and so that, that's the, um, that's, I guess, the third category, but I honestly, if, if, if I do this, uh, well, if I prepare for this well, um, uh, then, and I, and I deliver it well, I've, I've not had - I'm just trying to think now - I've not had the sort of unexpected crisis, um, or disruption in the clinical relationship, um, that um, that can happen when you make those other mistakes, cuz I've done those as well, like, "Let me, let me up the ante." That, that's really . . . Uh, it, it's . . . I guess it's what we know, as therapists, that when uh, when we're, we're kind of, uh, centered in on our game with this and pace well the clients, we are less apt to have a negative side effect of an intervention like this, than when we are more kind of coming out of our own reactivity or feeling like, "I gotta do something here," cuz when I come into this, I'm really prepared to accept any number of outcomes for this, uh, and (crosstalk)I think - yeah - and then the other thing I'll do is to say, "Well, what, what we did here was opened up a conversation about where we are in our work, okay, and where we're, where we're heading and where you see yourself, in terms of the benefits of our work. We can continue the conversation," so I never go into this conversation, ever, with the idea that this is a termination talk, okay, uh, and that we're gonna end today or next time. I'm opening up a way to uh, to process this, uh, bogged down phase in a way that it's not pejorative to them. That', that's the goal. 

00:26:50
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)You don't have an agenda. So now as you're saying this, I'm thinking of people, uh, who - I know you're familiar with their work - people like uh, Scott Miller and (ph)Barry Duncan and (ph)Phil Pinsoff and Michael Lambert, who do, uh, at the end of each session, they uh, have clients fill out forms, so they're always, from session to session, keeping track of progress and how they feel about their goal attainment. Have, have uh, you, uh, have you . . . Is one: what do you think of that kind of work?; and um, does . . . Is that something that you, that you yourself have ever tried in a systematic, session by session way? 

00:27:35
WILLIAM DOHERTY Well, I'll answer the second question first: I've, I've not uh, tried it, uh, but I think it's a terrific idea, uh, and why haven't I tried it? Probably clinical inertia. You know, I've been doing this so long and, you know, it's hard, hard, hard to implement something, even though intellectually I know it's a great idea, (crosstalk)um, but what I, what I like about that: it, it keeps what this is about in everybody's minds, (crosstalk)uh, and it, and it gives the therapist uh, uh, that kind of feedback, and then I, I could easily see using, uh, that kind of feedback as a mechanism to evaluate, you know? To say, "Gee, you know, I appreciate you filling the forms out, and as I've looked at your sense of, uh, where you're going with your goals. Uh, I see this line. (ph)Can we look at it together," (crosstalk)kind of like a physician looking at your, your hemoglobin A1C for (crosstalk)your diabetes, and, and this is something that . . ." Are you okay with that? Or is there something we should (ph)shift differently?" So that would be an example, uh, of, of, of a documentation or data that could be blended into this kind of conversation. 

00:28:40
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Yes. (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Yeah. So, as you're saying this with your Minn-, Minnesotan straightforwardness, and uh, uh, good sense, why don't we do this all the time? What is it that prevents therapists from having exactly this kind of, uh, the, the, this kind of conversation periodically with clients? 

00:29:10
WILLIAM DOHERTY That's a good question. I, I think it may be because we're trained, as professionals, to be, to feel responsible for what's going on. Right? We're, we're, we're the expert, even if you see yourself as deeply collaborative and connect with people's feelings. Uh, you know, "I'm the expert here, uh, and if things aren't working well it's up for me to shift and, and uh, I . . .", and which is partly true, of course, but uh, we don't, we, in our training, uh, we, we don't get much work on having these "It's you and me and we're doing this thing together" and "Can we talk about how we're doing this thing together?" 

00:29:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:29:50
WILLIAM DOHERTY Right? Uh, it's a different way to be in a professional relationship . . . 

00:29:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:29:55
WILLIAM DOHERTY . . . than the, uh certainly than the psychoanalyst doing that, and that's still in our, in, in our heritage, (crosstalk)where, if you're more behavioral, you're the trainer, you're the teacher, uh, and um, and also it's a little threatening, cuz you're, you're inviting, you're inviting feedback. You're uh, you know . . . When I say "our work" and "how we're doing," it's partly me . . . 

00:30:20
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)In our culture, yeah. Yeah. 

00:30:20
WILLIAM DOHERTY Okay? And that's a little more threatening, and what we're more likely to do is want to interpret, you know? We wait for the client to signal that they're not happy with (crosstalk)us, and then we interpret it for them. 

00:30:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah, I think it really does, uh, say something about the culture of our field, and so the, this implicit analytic tradition and some of these other sources of influence that you were, you were just referring to that makes this seem something other than the most straightforward, uh, way in which one conducts a relationship where somebody is coming in, providing a service, uh, and at some point, if it doesn't seem to be working, that it's directly addressed between . . . 

00:31:05
WILLIAM DOHERTY Yeah. (crosstalk)Yeah, with . . . 

00:31:10
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)And that interface between (crosstalk)we're service providers and we're into this very, this more intimate kind of relationship with people (crosstalk)(inaudible ) . . . 

00:31:18
WILLIAM DOHERTY (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Yeah, and it's a bracketed moment, you know, so you, and you have to prepare for it, so uh, and if we could shift, if this is an okay time to shift (crosstalk)to the, uh, little bit more dramatic ones where (crosstalk)somebody, in the second category I wanted to talk about, is when the client's stuck and they're, uh, and they're making, uh, uh, poor choices that are hurting them in their life, and this, this comes, came out of a workshop we did at the uh, at the Symposium this year, where I asked, uh, where, uh, where do you feel clumsy? What, what . . . Where are the conversations clumsy with clients, uh, where you feel off your game . . . 

00:31:55
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Sure, okay. (crosstalk)Okay, great. Yeah. 

00:31:55
WILLIAM DOHERTY . . . uh, and uh, and, and, and the, the, one of the lead categories was a form of this sort of bogged down stuckness, stuckness, but here, unlike the examples I gave before where people were doing okay but therapy was get, getting kind of uh, bogged down or boring or whatever, um, these are where somebody is making a series, a continued series of mistakes in the relationship, so an example would be - in fact, this was the example at the symposium, um, uh, workshop - where, uh, this, this, this woman who was in AA, uh, was going through a series of guys she'd meet at AA, invite 'em home, uh, sex pretty fast, and then the guy would move in, you know? Like, a couple of times he'd be around and then he moves his toothbrush in, uh, and these are guys early in their recovery, and she would end up feeling used, emotionally abused, and devastated, and then, you know, her therapist would work through her healing and learning from that and then she was going to AA a lot, okay; there are always new guys coming in and so hope springs eternal, so there'd be a new guy, and this therapist saying, like, after five guys her therapist wanted to wring her neck, um, uh, and uh, we've all had clients like that, uh, where . . . Now here's the set-up for it: we feel like we have a good relationship with them; they come; they pay the bills; they like what we're offering them; um, uh, they maybe develop insight, but they're continuing to hurt themselves, um, with, with, with serious mistakes, so starting with the mistakes . . . So you got, we got that as the set-up here? Um, and so the, the big temptation for the therapist here is to feel like my professional competence is tied up in her making better choices in her life, right? Cuz I feel responsible, I care about her, um, doing, I'm at (ph)kiss consultation and they're giving me six ideas of how to, what, what else to unpack in her life that has gotten her to make these bad choices. I feel like going to AA with her and saying, "Don't, don't . . .", you know, so, so I'm feeling this, this, uh, over-responsibility, uh, which is, which is then a dangerous moment, so where can that go in terms of the stakes? We can be parental. So we can say, "So, so after, Martha, after all you've been through with men, why do you think you invited this guy home after the first meeting, first time you met him at AA? Why, why do you think you invited him home?" It's a hostile question, right? Do you agree with me? Right? I mean, with that preface, right? (crosstalk)It, it's basically saying, uh, "I am so, I'm so frustrated." 

00:35:00
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)I-, it's (ph)tricky. That's loaded, yeah, yeah. The unstated, the weight of the unstated, there, yeah. 

00:35:00
WILLIAM DOHERTY The weight of the unstated, that's right. Um, um, um, um, or, or, even more broadly, because this is what you can get in your case consultation. See, when your case consultation group gets frustrated because they've been hearing about Martha, you know, for the last year and a half, and they're sick of it too, okay? And so, so what happens is somebody . . . I still remember a case consultation where another therapist leaned towards me and said, "Maybe your client gets a lot out of being this miserable. Maybe you should unpack that." You know? So if your, if you just transfer that frustration right to your client and you say something, like, "So Martha, why, why do you think you need for men to treat you badly" That plays really well in your case consultation. I mean, that's right incisive, right there (crosstalk)and . . . 

00:36:05
RICH SIMON Daring, therapeutically daring. 

00:36:10
WILLIAM DOHERTY Daring, daring, and what it's coming from is "I don't know what the heck to do. I'm really frustrated with you here," and uh, and so, I'm gonna remember back in the countergroup days in the 70s. There was this cartoon of one guy sticking a sword right through the other guy's heart, and he says, "I know this hurts, but how else can I make you grow?" Okay? So it's what I call the Hostile Therapist Question that, that, that is disguised as, as deeply insightful. 

00:36:40
RICH SIMON Caring and (crosstalk)therapeutic. 

00:36:40
WILLIAM DOHERTY (crosstalk)That's right, that's right. Or the other mistake is to basically threaten to end therapy, and I, I had a client, um, where the psychiatrist, uh, said - this was a woman with anorexia nervosa - that if you get below 95 lbs, I can't see you any more as your doctor. Whoa. I mean, that's like telling a depressed person, "If you, if your Beck scores stay this low, I'm done with you," you know? Right? Um, and um, so that's the threaten to withdrawal because I'm overwhelmed. So . . . 

00:37:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:37:15
WILLIAM DOHERTY . . . so, so, what, what, what are some other ways to . . . And I actually did. I, I uh, practiced what I'm preaching these days. One of the things I'm bringing to my case consultation groups is sometimes not a particular client, but a scenario. Okay? (ph)Humma. So I brought this one to my case consultation group; there are some very good therapists there: what do you do with clients who are making the same bad decisions over and over, but they come back, they like working with you, they seem to have insight, I mean, just all of this stuff that is happening in the session looks good, except they're doing all this crazy stuff from the outset, uh, so, and I took notes, and some of this is what they gave me and some of it's my own. Um, the, the uh . . . And my colleague, (ph)Noel Larsen, who is really a quite gifted therapist, um, talks about clients' need for both and change and growth and stability, and that, uh, and that, and that, if what you, you, the stance you can take is to honor both that she's here because these relationships and these choices give her pain, but that also, there's something about what she's doing that gives her stability in her life: she knows where to find guys, you know, um, and, and so to, to get one's self re-balanced around people staying the course in their life vs. changing and , and to not tilt too much towards one side. That's sort of a, at a, at a metastrategy, but how, how can you do it on, uh, concretely? What I do is, is to look for something positive, something honorable, um, um, something potentially wise or smart in what the client's doing, so for the, for the woman who is, uh, who is having one bad relationship with the guys in AA after another to say um, uh, "you're somebody who doesn't wanna give up on men because you've had bad experiences," okay? "You, you, what, what's an important value to you is to bring yourself fresh to each new relationship and, and to, and to not be encumbered that, you know, that this guy must be a jerk because other guys have been a jerk. Uh, a woman who was staying with an abusive, um, uh, partner, um, uh, and who is worried about the kids and this is the father of the children . . . Um, one of the mistakes therapists make is not to honor her commitment to keeping her kids' father in their lives, okay? And to . . . You have to believe that, you have to honor it, you have to credit it that there's some value that she's experiencing that isn't just pathological value that she's coming from. Um, there's some core of, of health or potential happiness in there that, that, uh, that is uh, that is uh, leading her to do things that others are, are saying, and that sometimes she thinks are, are not, not healthy, so it's the working both sides of the street on this. Uh, in addition, when I'm going to challenge - so this is a question of how do you challenge somebody who, um, uh, without being parental. So here's an example of a craft, a couple of craft skills: if I'm gonna challenge somebody about, uh, choices they're making that I think are hurting them, then I, I either preface it - I'll usually preface it - or immediately follow it with an autonomy-granting statement, so here would be, um,a um, a um, I would say "Martha, um, uh, I'm gonna offer a challenge here, uh, and I'm gonna offer it in the spirit that this is your life and that I don't get evoked in your decisions, but I get to give you my feedback and you get to do with it whatever you want", okay? So that's the set-up, and then how do I then deliver the challenge in a way that isn't um, um, you know, "you, you are behaving dysfunctionally", you know, be, be sounding parental, or you're enacting old childhood traumas here with these, with these men. Um, and so one of the ways I do it - and this can be a very effective challenge - is to say, "I'm worried for you. I'm, I'm, I'm worried that, that you're, um, that your, your, your, your wish and desire to take each new guy for himself and not to, not to just assume he is gonna be like all the others, that I'm worried that, that, that, that very, uh, positive part of you is gonna get you into, uh, uh, the same trouble you've been in before, and that you're, you're, you're going to, um, um, uh, you, you're just gonna go deeper into the kind of pit that you've been in. That's what I'm worried for you." Now . . . So I set it up with "this is just Bill here talking . . . 

00:43:00
RICH SIMON Disclaimer, yeah. 

00:43:00
WILLIAM DOHERTY . . . I don't get the vote," uh, and then, but the "I'm worried for you," um, uh, is a uh, personal but also a therapeutic challenge that often is better than the, um, just the objective one, like, "I see you walking into the same trap" to say, "My concern for you is that you're about to." Um, I'll say, sometimes, to, to, to people that, that what I'm, what I'm concerned about is that in six months, you're gonna look back at this moment with the clarity of six months ahead and say, "What was I thinking?" So it's part of my job to put that in right now. 

00:43:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:43:45
WILLIAM DOHERTY Okay? Um, so these . . . Another one would be to say . . . So, let me, let me step back and say, uh, how to process the fact that, that the client knows that I think this is a bad mistake, you know? I'm thinking about a client I had with a series of - she had a lot of money - she had a series of men who took advantage of her. So she's in a new relationship with a guy. On the third date, he's asking for a lung, okay? 

00:44:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:44:15
WILLIAM DOHERTY Uh, and um, uh, and so, uh, I, you know, I . . . She knew where I was, what my concerns were about that, um, and one of the things I do then, is if I'm pushing, even with all these craft skills, pushing on the side of, uh, of uh, asking somebody to look at these as mistakes, then what I'll do is to back up. See, I remember in a session with the same woman, I began by saying, um . . . You know, I, I think I came on about as strong as I come on, you know, uh, uh, about my concern about this relationship in, in our last session, so, um, "So what was that like for you?" And I . . . So, clearly, uh, was suggesting, in my sort of, you know, therapy speak, uh, that I thought this was a disaster in the making. "How did that go down for you and how are you feeling now about the fact that I did that in the last session?" Okay? And so we processed the fact that I am a skeptic about a choice she's making, and then how do we live with that, with that tension? 

00:45:45
RICH SIMON And then wha- . . . So how did . . . So play this out for us. So, so you didn't simply say, "Yet again, I wanna tell you once again, I'm (crosstalk)worried about this. I have concerns." However you might phrase it. So you'd done that, you felt like that was communicated, there's no point in having to repeat that (crosstalk)message again (crosstalk)until . . . 

00:46:05
WILLIAM DOHERTY (crosstalk)Right, right, right. (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)So I stopped. 

00:46:05
RICH SIMON You stopped and, and you (crosstalk)(inaudible ) . . . 

00:46:08
WILLIAM DOHERTY (crosstalk)And processed what happened. She said, uh, that uh, uh, that she felt, uh, cared for, that I had expressed that serious concern, uh, and that she thought I, and maybe I was right. She thought maybe, you know, she was a betting women, that odds were more, you know, that I was right, but that, that, that she wasn't ready to let that go, that she was gonna be more protective about lending money, um, um, but that uh, uh, she thought this could be a good relationship, and then, and now here's the last part of all this, is then, then I'm working with her; I accept that. I accept that, okay? I accept, and so we move on to work on her being as healthy as she can be in a relationship that I think is unhealthy, uh, and that I wait until one of us is proven right, okay?, Um, but I don't keep coming on. See, I don't get into the nag role. Um, I, I, I I will . . .Um, I don't nag. I will, I will come out with it, I'll be prepared for it. I'm trying not to leaking out my over-responsibility (ph)and (ph)for (ph)refer that this is part of my job, this is what I do, it's up to you, so, but, like, absolutely out there, and then, and then I'm like, um, you know, then, then it's their life, and if I really do believe it's their life then I have to be patient, and work with whatever good and health I can work with until we see how this plays out, but then, then the point is, Rich, that I'm not frustrated any more . . . 

00:47:50
RICH SIMON Yeah, yep. 

00:47:50
WILLIAM DOHERTY Okay? That I processed, with her, that which I processed inside me and, hopefully, with my colleagues, if I can get them not to be too frustrated. 

00:48:00
RICH SIMON And so tell us how this - uh, so this got my attention - how did this play itself out with this particular client? 

00:48:10
WILLIAM DOHERTY She eventually dug in on the fact that he wouldn't let her see his apartment. He never invited her to his place, ever. Slept over her place a lot, um, and he also was not repaying the loan, but where she dug in was it didn't seem right, it didn't seem right that after a year and a half that she never saw where he lived . . . 

00:48:40
RICH SIMON Oh dear. 

00:48:40
WILLIAM DOHERTY . . . and so I went, "Yeah. What do you make of that?" You know? Uh, and then I played on this felt disrespectful to her and uh, uh, he would say, "Well, it's not really fixed up," he values her too much, you know, to, take her to a place that's so shoddy and, you know, so "what do you make of that?" and so that was where she dug in and she wasn't gonna give him any more money, and then he ditched her, okay, cuz she, he wasn't gonna be able to user her any more, uh, and then we processed, uh, and I just had a interesting - this was a number of years ago . . . I just got an e-mail, uh, from this particular client, who has gone on, uh, she said in her e-mail, to have better relationships, you know, and, you know, she's not, nobody's lived with her since, which I think is probably pretty good, and um, and she, she has not made that degree of mistake (ph)before, again. 

00:49:40
RICH SIMON So, in terms of, in the, the classic ideas, some, these are, the, these are maybe mid-Western confrontations or beyond that, just that you're framing them very carefully and what, in a style that's very consistent with how you think about psychotherapy, (crosstalk)so one, one thinks of, and there are therapists I think who we both know who have a more, um, uh, somewhat abrasive style - get, you know, more, more, more aggressive style. Uh, is there any role . . . 

00:50:10
WILLIAM DOHERTY Yeah. 

00:50:10
RICH SIMON . . . where that kind of approach with a client - you've described a, your internally consistent way of dealing with situations where you're trying to get the client's attention and make them aware of, of some consequences that are negative. Is there uh . . . (crosstalk)What's, what's your response (ph)not (ph)in, uh, perhaps in your own work, but in other people's work (crosstalk)of confrontation. 

00:50:30
WILLIAM DOHERTY (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Sure, sure. Yeah, uh, I think uh, different styles can work here, um . . . 

00:50:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:50:35
WILLIAM DOHERTY . . . and somebody could be much more direct about, uh, you know, uh, uh, "Martha, this guy is uh, uh, you know, is, is wanting to borrow money from you on the third date. Uh, you know, what, what do, you know, what, what, what, what are you thinking?" kind of thing. The problem is if it doesn't work . . . I mean, in other words, if, if she says what my client said to me is that, "Yeah, you may be right, but I'm gonna do it", what do you do next? Okay? And it's sort of like what I say to parents who, who believe in spanking: "What's your encore after that?", you know, when you've already utilized your most aggressive move and it doesn't work, well, then what? You know? You hang 'em by their toes? Or what do you do next? 

00:51:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:51:20
WILLIAM DOHERTY And so, um, my, so um, um, that, that's where, uh, when I think in terms of the clinical relationship, you can only, there are only so many arrows in your quiver for this sort of thing, uh, uh, and what do you do if it doesn't work? 

00:51:35
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. 

00:51:35
WILLIAM DOHERTY So, um, so I, and I think if you, you know . . .I'm actually, compared to a lot of people I supervise, a fairly challenging therapist, but I try to do it in a way that allows me room, degrees of freedom, depending on how that (crosstalk)works, okay? So that's why whenever I do a major confrontation about somebody's life choices, I pair it with an autonomy granting . . . 

00:52:05
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. 

00:52:05
WILLIAM DOHERTY . .. cuz it gives me . . . What I don't want to end up with is "I just challenged you, Rich," and then I'm leaning forward. "Now what, okay?" I don't wanna do that. 

00:52:15
RICH SIMON Yeah, so you're . . . Yeah, so you're taking the temperature of the relationship. So what, what comes across in our conversation - and we just have a little bit more time here - that is very striking to me is, um, an awareness of the parameters of the therapy relationship and the boundaries of it in, in the very, in the ways you've described these two kinds of different kinds of situations and it makes me aware that, I think, often, in this work, we get uh, we're not aware of the assumption we're making about the relationship, as therapists, with the client. We get invested in something or other or, or uh, and we forget the nature and the, of the therapy relationship. There's a quality in what you're describing of your having stepped outside and examined and then coming back into the relationship, as kind of that's your style as a therapist. Your . . . "What is it uh . . . What's this role I have in this person's life? How do I see that in perspective in these difficult moments, rather than getting engaged emotionally, or hooked, how do I understand what I can and can't do?", when there's a sense of limitation and, and I think that's the part that many of us don't like to accept, the uh, necessary and important limitation of the therapy relationship and the impact that you have on people's lives. 

00:53:45
WILLIAM DOHERTY That's, that's an interesting way to put it, and, and I, I think I may be influenced by all the years I worked with physicians because um, uh, I really became aware of the limitations of that relationship. I mean, somebody who's gonna handle their diabetes mostly on their own, outside of the clinical office, okay? 

00:54:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:54:05
WILLIAM DOHERTY And uh, the, the physician is a healer, but in terms of lifestyle choices is a consultant. 

00:54:10
RICH SIMON A consultant, yeah. 

00:54:15
WILLIAM DOHERTY Um, and so there's a . . . We are both healers and consultants . . . 

00:54:20
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:54:20
WILLIAM DOHERTY . . . and the, the healer part, often is, is when we are deeply connected with somebody. Something is happening in the room right now. There's something opening up in their lives and so, so there, there's that intimate, um, connection we can have that, that, that often, you know, is such a joy in therapy. In terms of the choices people are making outside, and that's maybe one of the themes of our webinar here, is what people are doing on the outside. Either they're not doing much - okay, that's the bogged down, but they're coming to us - or they're doing stuff over and over that's, that's not helping them; it's hurting them (crosstalk)or other people in their lives, um, then, then I am both a healer and a consultant cuz they're making these choices, and I don't wanna overplay. I'm not their supervisor, (crosstalk)okay, uh, and if I overplay that consultant role, the parental be, uh, uh, and sort of "let me try another trick here," um, uh, uh, be uh, th-, then I am uh, not gonna be the healer for them. That is my main calling. 

00:55:25
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Yeah. Okay. All right. Uh, it seems like a really good place to stop cuz there's a, uh, a uh, a clarity to the way you approach your work that uh, I, I think is a big part of this contribution that you, you make to the field and, and are making to this webcast, so, um, to those people who are interested in following up and finding about training resources or any more about your work, reading things, uh, where can they go? Where are these resources? 

00:56:05
WILLIAM DOHERTY Uh, drbilldoherty.org. 

00:56:05
RICH SIMON Okay, and so, and what will they find there? 

00:56:10
WILLIAM DOHERTY Uh, they'll find the articles they can download for free and um, um, other sorts, other sorts of things. 

00:56:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:56:15
WILLIAM DOHERTY Goo-, goodies. 

00:56:20
RICH SIMON Goo-, goodies from Bill Doherty goodies. Okay. Terrific. Uh, I would like to invite people, uh, this is, will be your time to get, to be part of the conversation, uh, that uh, that we've been having here with Bill, so there's a comment board below the screen. We have, uh, insights, "Aha!" moments, as you've been listening to this, as well as questions, connections you've made, please share those with the rest of the group cuz it's good for you, it's good for all of us. Let's let this conversation . . . In all of these interviews, the, the conversation on the screen is just the beginning. They'll will, uh, as, as the others, our interviewees will look at the comment board and you'll guarantee a response but if he is so moved, maybe you'll get lucky. Bill, what a pleasure, as always, (crosstalk)to talk with you. Thank you for talking. 

00:57:10
