Power-Based Therapy with Female Military Veterans 

00:00:05
Vanessa Jackson, LCSW 

00:00:10
VANESSA JACKSON Hi, I'm Vanessa Jackson. I'm a therapist and private practice in Atlanta, Georgia and I have recently co-edited a book called "Understanding Power, Human Services Imperative." And today I want to talk to you a little bit about how I use what I call Power-based therapy to work with female veterans. And one of the things that umm… my clients have told me who are veterans is so often their experiences, especially as women of color who are also in the military uh… are reintegrating back into society in non-military roles, is that their life stories and their pain and their attempts to deal with post traumatic stress disorder are oftentimes umm… invisible because the image of the, the veteran that we see so often is white and male and so oftentimes they are trying to find their way to healing uh… without any sort of visible role models. And so one of the things that I want to do umm… in, in my work is to take their stories and to take their healing strategies that we've co-created in our work together, to talk about ways that we can provide as clinicians healing environment that are unique to the roles and experiences of female veterans. Because they are already marginalized in, in the roles and then when they come home they have to deal with both the traumas that they bring back uh… and also trying to retain their identity umm… as sort of battle ready warriors uh… but also really having lots of experiences that have been very hard for them to function in day-to-day lives. And so uh… what I would like to do is, is to work around the issues about how trauma shows up in their lives and, to talk about some innovative ways. that my clients have taught me in fact how they address uh… issues of hyper vigilance and irritation and depression that are oftentimes a hallmark to their experience of the PTSD uh… to find more emotional flexibility, to find more peace when the things that I hear oftentimes is that, people feel like they're still in combat situations once they return home and that people who have not had the military experience don't quite understand what it's like for them umm… and that they're also then at the same time trained to not show and fear not show pain and, and that's oftentimes very critical when they're in life threatening situations, it's not a time to have a meltdown or time to be emotionally expressive. But then what happens is they never get the space to then process that which only aggravates the trauma that they're experiencing. And so our role as therapists is to create a safe environment while respecting that their learning patterns uh… that were central to their training and their survival. And so for us to be able to hear their stories, hear their unique experiences as women and then even more specifically as women of color of how their life experiences prior to the military impact, how they function and also what they learnt in the military, how that shows up when they come home. So being able to be aware of how race, class, sexual orientation, all these forms of umm… life experiences that often marginalize them may be barriers to their efforts to heal from the trauma that they experienced as part of their combat experiences. 

00:03:45
Introduction to Session 

00:03:50
VANESSA JACKSON And, and now I want to introduce you to my client Sharyna and we've been working together uh… in helping her to cope with coming back from combat situations and negotiating the depression, the irritability. And this whole sense of her life umm… as, as very threatening, even though she is now back home and safe enough. Uh… And so I want to be able to uh… sort of show you how we use power-based therapy to help her umm… work through the trauma that she's experienced and ultimately find her own peace. 

00:04:30
Session with Sharyna 

00:04:30
VANESSA JACKSON How are you doing today? 

00:04:35
SHARYNA I'm doing good. How are you? 

00:04:35
VANESSA JACKSON Just fine. It's good to see you again. So how's it been going? 

00:04:40
SHARYNA It's been going okay. It's just normal stuff I had to deal with. 

00:04:45
VANESSA JACKSON Like what? 

00:04:45
SHARYNA I just, I just feel like I just say, just irritated on a regular basis. 

00:04:50
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:04:55
SHARYNA Nowadays. Tired even though I'm sleeping. Try to get a lot of sleep but I just feel like I wake up and the same old. 

00:05:00
VANESSA JACKSON So, let's sort of see if we can unpack the irritation a little bit. Does it come up… In certain times there's a feel like, it's pretty constant state. 

00:05:10
SHARYNA It feels pretty constant. 

00:05:10
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, so it's always like that last nerve. 

00:05:15
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:05:15
VANESSA JACKSON Has exposed. 

00:05:15
SHARYNA Absolutely. 

00:05:20
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. So I'm wondering if we try, if you want to follow me and try some a little unusual today with this. Like we're gonna understand the last nerve and this constant state of irritation. 

00:05:30
SHARYNA Okay. 

00:05:30
VANESSA JACKSON And of course, we know that this is whole part of the wounding, the PTSD that comes from your military service. So we know sort of some of the underneath parts. But how… What's it like to live in a state of constant irritation? 

00:05:45
SHARYNA Just no peace. I just feel like I have to hold back all the time and, and just, you know, to be, little things I'll just be driving and someone cuts me off and I just, just rise there. And so I just don't have any peace. I don't feel like I can just relax. 

00:06:05
VANESSA JACKSON So umm… I'm, I'm hearing you talk about this no peace and, and I can't help sort of contrast that but you've been at war. And that so, it keeps you in this constant state of being, sort of at war. Did, did that connection… 

00:06:25
SHARYNA I didn't think about that. 

00:06:30
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:06:30
SHARYNA I… That didn't cross my mind. But even… I mean, yeah, I went out and, and saw some stuff but that… You know, I had to just go through that. You can't, you know, let that affect you or so you're not gonna make it. You're not gonna get through that. 

00:06:50
VANESSA JACKSON And here's the tricky part about it. Because again as a soldier, you have to be prepared, you have to respond and you have to survive. But then there becomes a part about the human person, who then has to make sense of what she's experienced. And where has there been place for that woman to process, the things that you had to see and umm… the fear? 

00:07:20
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:07:25
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. Where do you… Where do you take that? Who do you take that to? 

00:07:30
SHARYNA There's no one I can take that to. 

00:07:30
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:07:30
SHARYNA I haven't had a chance to really… I don't like to talk about it because people here, you know, I just don't feel like I can open up to anyone around me. They look at me crazy and you know, because there's some dark heavy stuff. 

00:07:50
VANESSA JACKSON But, but you're saying, so now do we get a better sense for that last nerve is waving. Why the irritation is so big? 

00:08:00
SHARYNA Yeah, I've never been able to release any of that. 

00:08:00
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And so one of the things is making sure that this space is a safe space for you to tell, let it out. Umm… And some of, that's gonna look like anger, some of that's gonna look like sadness, some of, it's gonna look like vulnerability. So think, you just sort of took a little side with that. 

00:08:30
Client does not want to show vulnerability 

00:08:30
SHARYNA I don't really like being vulnerable and, and laying things out in the open like that. That doesn't come easy to me. 

00:08:35
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And so, some of it's about learning how to do it because and I, I really appreciate you sharing that truth, that, that's not, it's, it's, it's counter all your training, isn't it? 

00:08:45
SHARYNA Yup. 

00:08:45
VANESSA JACKSON So you… 

00:08:45
SHARYNA There's no time for that stuff. There's no… You do what you're told. 

00:08:50
VANESSA JACKSON And you act, in, in the acting and being able to do what you're told in the moment to keep your alive. 

00:08:55
SHARYNA Yes. 

00:08:55
VANESSA JACKSON And so it makes sense then as you would default to that. Uh… And at the same time, and coming back and trying to heal, it's going to be actually we're trying to do something very counter to that. It's to slow it down, to, to open it up, to feel. And maybe even you feel like, you're falling apart a little bit. Okay, you look not thrown by that. 

00:09:25
SHARYNA I'm falling apart. I'm not really… That does not sound good to me at all. I don't want to fall apart. 

00:09:30
VANESSA JACKSON I'm, I'm glad that you said it because I think that happens a lot is that if I, if I let this feeling up then I won't be able to pack it back down and go about my day. So when I say falling apart, it, I think people will feel like, oh, my God, like completely with my mind, that's my worst fear and then that people think I'm this bad out fear that can't function and that's… And at the same time, it's, it's being able to say is, I have a right to my feelings. I have a right to my sadness. I have a right to my fear and I'm not in this moment in that place where I couldn't show it because I had to stay safe and focused. But now I'm in a place where there's some time and space for me to feel what wasn't safe to feel back then. And once you kind of have the pain on a loop and you keep shutting it down. 

00:10:20
SHARYNA Yeah, yeah. 

00:10:25
VANESSA JACKSON And, and living it over like it's happening again and that's what we want to get you out of that cycle. 

00:10:30
Getting out of cycle of pain "on a loop" 

00:10:30
SHARYNA Yeah. Definitely. 

00:10:30
VANESSA JACKSON And to get out of that cycle, I want to invite you into this thing, that's gonna feel a bit uncomfortable. 

00:10:40
SHARYNA Okay. 

00:10:45
Externalizing 

00:10:45
VANESSA JACKSON Maybe a lot uncomfortable of course. But, but some, some of… So one of the things often I actually do is, like, I like to do this thing, uh… externalizing. So you talk about that irritation and like it's just so constant and it's like this last nerve, it's just waving out there, that doesn't have any peace. So if we're gonna talk to that last nerve about why it has no peace? What would it say to us? 

00:11:05
SHARYNA So what do you mean last nerve? I get to a person or something? 

00:11:05
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, it's almost like… Sometimes when things are within it so much, we're in the feeling or so you're just suppressing the feeling, it's, you almost lose sight of what's going on. And so one of things I like to tell people is to keep their pain inside, keep your wound inside because you can't heal what you conceal. So sometimes we have to make it even bigger than it was and to take it outside of ourselves because right now, it's like your constant companion. 

00:11:30
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:11:35
VANESSA JACKSON And you're almost… It's happening before, you know what's happening. And so when I say, take it outside and make it something external to you, it's a way of us, understanding its nature. 

00:11:40
SHARYNA Okay. 

00:11:40
VANESSA JACKSON So we think about the irritation, it's like when does it show up. Do certain things invite it out, is it, is the irritation scared? Is it sad? Is it angry? And so by pulling it out and making it like stepping outside. Like okay, she's asking me to, like have a separate personality, a little bit. 

00:12:05
SHARYNA Okay. 

00:12:05
VANESSA JACKSON But it's the experience of irritation. 

00:12:10
SHARYNA Okay. 

00:12:10
VANESSA JACKSON That is with you all the time, right. So I want to get to know your irritation so that I can help you negotiate with irritation. 

00:12:20
SHARYNA Okay. 

00:12:20
VANESSA JACKSON It's weird, I did… 

00:12:20
SHARYNA That is a little different. 

00:12:25
VANESSA JACKSON It's a little different right? 

00:12:25
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:12:25
VANESSA JACKSON So I'm gonna ask you… So and some of, you're getting to know this outside of yourself too. So, it's okay, if we've got to ask some questions about the understanding. 

00:12:35
SHARYNA Okay. 

00:12:35
VANESSA JACKSON So think about your irritation. What's… When does this show up? 

00:12:40
SHARYNA My irritation shows up hugely if something unexpected happens, which is… I mean, as little as like I said, someone cutting me off or I get a last minute phone call with an emergency. So it does not like surprises, I could say that. 

00:13:00
VANESSA JACKSON Because, and you can so… Yeah, like so… Did you know that, that this irritation didn't like surprises? Okay and so whether, like you said, it's in traffic uh… or a call with an emergency and then you're asked to respond immediately. 

00:13:15
SHARYNA Yes. 

00:13:20
VANESSA JACKSON When you're already holding yourself together? 

00:13:20
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:13:20
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, so that tends to spike it a bit more, right? 

00:13:25
SHARYNA Absolutely. 

00:13:25
VANESSA JACKSON And so do you have any sense about what calms the last nerve? 

00:13:35
SHARYNA Uh… Either, if the situation goes away and I don't have to deal with it or it's been fixed in a way that makes me happy I think. 

00:13:45
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. And, and some of it that, then raises an issue for me or thought like how does control play into that? Like when certainly something jumps in and you don't have a sense of control. It's much more likely that the irritation would show up. 

00:14:00
SHARYNA Yes. 

00:14:00
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:14:00
SHARYNA That's it. 

00:14:00
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah. And, and because again you're using a lot of your emotional energy just to kind of move through the day. And so someone throws something at you and if it's like a car, you think about the, in traffic, like with even without a history of trauma, without having had the experiences in combat that scares in that moment, right? And you think… And for most of us then like, well, we start thinking about all the other things that could have happened, if we hadn't been able to break. 

00:14:30
SHARYNA Yes. 

00:14:30
VANESSA JACKSON And your heart is just racing. 

00:14:30
SHARYNA Yes. 

00:14:35
VANESSA JACKSON And you're mad at someone, threatened your life with the traffic move and so it's, that you're scared. And then you have to then figure out and settle it back down. And look around and say, well, I'm safe. And even like the traffic thing it usually takes most of us, a hot second, four five miles of driving and because you've got this other trauma, it might take a little bit longer to stand it out. And so the other piece of it is how not to get mad because you have the reaction, because life will throw you things so that you don't have this, another problem on top of it. First of all, I got start in this moment, or I got upset because suddenly emergency shows up. And then you can get mad at yourself because you had the startled response. 

00:15:25
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:15:25
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, how often does that happen? 

00:15:30
SHARYNA Most of the times because the, the response in me, it's kind of, that startledness it kind of, I guess it goes back to that control thing. I don't like not being caught unprepared, so… 

00:15:40
VANESSA JACKSON So then wondering, what it would be like to sort of get gentle with yourself. Because and we get why you're on high alert because you are in situations if you weren't vigilant, you or other people could die. 

00:15:55
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:16:00
Practicing non-judgment 

00:16:00
VANESSA JACKSON And it's really hard to, to take that tape off. And, and so then you have a reaction which is, you know, preparing. And, and how to least if we can interrupt the part where you judge yourself for having that reaction. Like, what would it be like to not judge yourself for having the startled response? 

00:16:20
SHARYNA I think that would be better. I just, it's so automatic, like I didn't even realize that's what I was doing. 

00:16:30
Interrupting the judgment 

00:16:30
VANESSA JACKSON Actually, this is why, I was asking to slow it down and to look at it because why would you have known that. It just was automatic. And that's why we want to slow it down and pull it outside of yourself to say, wait, I'm gonna have this reaction, like, I have the startled response. That's just a very human response and because there's a whole other story of, you know, safety around it, it's more intense. What you can interrupt more quickly is judging yourself for having a reaction. Like I'm just hitting reaction, so let me take care of myself. 

00:17:05
SHARYNA How would I, how would I do that? 

00:17:10
VANESSA JACKSON I was gonna say. Let's think about where you could do that. So and this is where I'm also asking to sort of get a little bit more body wisdom because you got to be able to read your body, because you know, your heart is beating at that point, right. And, and, and to think about like, so what would I need to comfort myself? Which is also the other piece, my right to comfort. Like if you saw someone in distress, "what would you do to help them shift out of that distress?" 

00:17:40
SHARYNA Probably talk to them, make them think of something that will make them laugh or one of their favorite songs or something. 

00:17:50
VANESSA JACKSON So how would you do that for yourself? How would you then, because that's what you'd offered to someone else right, with no hesitation? 

00:17:55
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:17:55
VANESSA JACKSON And no judgment? 

00:17:55
SHARYNA No judgment. 

00:17:55
VANESSA JACKSON Okay and what we're trying to interrupt right now is the judgment piece so that we can get to the care piece. And so what you say for anybody else is that person is irritated, there's maybe scared, they're startled, they're having this whole physical reaction and I want to support them in standing that down. And you would never think to judge them. 

00:18:20
SHARYNA No. 

00:18:20
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, so my invitation to you is how you slide it over to yourself? 

00:18:25
SHARYNA I had to go back to what, with kind of get me in that better place umm… probably something I would do to relief my stress that I could take my attention off of it. 

00:18:40
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, and it maybe sometimes a first thing, I mean, don't, it could be, I just got startled, it's gonna take me a half second, I'm taking a couple of breaths, I'm gonna sing a song. I'm going to try to shake it, but what I'm not gonna do is hurting myself or judge myself about it. And part of it is about understanding some of the, the protective factor umm… I think when we talk about, like the hyper vigilance that happens with, you know, post traumatic stress disorder or with any kind of wounding is, it's almost like a guard dog that's out of control. It's there for a reason, but now it's over functioning in such a way that it's patrolling the whole neighborhood and it's barking all night. And what you needed to say is that, was just a mouse. That wasn't a tank. 

00:19:40
Use of metaphors to help understand problem 

00:19:40
SHARYNA Okay. 

00:19:45
VANESSA JACKSON And so but in the mean time you got to bring the reaction down, so that you can just remind yourself that wait, in this moment, let me look around, I'm safe. Because we, we are trying to sort of staying down the story. Oh, when it wasn't. Does that make sense? 

00:19:55
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:20:00
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. So the first piece though is just to circle back is how to comfort yourself and maybe that's a more useful word is not calm yourself but how can you comfort yourself when you've been startled and, and scared. 

00:20:15
SHARYNA Yeah. I mean, in that moment though, the, the things that I normally do to comfort myself is just kind of get away on my own and you know, read a book, but I don't know how I could do that in the car, you know. 

00:20:35
VANESSA JACKSON Good. Because it would not be useful to stop and read in the moment. 

00:20:40
SHARYNA Right. 

00:20:40
VANESSA JACKSON Uh… But the piece of it is saying that, maybe at that point, some deep breaths and because it might take a while for your body to settle down, is that you could again take some deep breaths, turn on some music, some things that would offer some distraction in the moment but then you also want to go back to sort of some deeper comfort. So when you get home, whether it's… Oh, let me, if it's possible, let me go to the safe place. Where's my safe place? My safe place is a spot on the beach. If my safe place is, a room in my house, and then check in again and be able to take the moment, because sometimes you're going to a place where you can stop drop and roll, other places, you're gonna have to stop, notice and keep walking. But you notice it, because what happens is in those situations before, you didn't have the luxury of stopping and noticing, right? And what we got to remind your self is that's no longer the case. It's, it's actually safe to notice right now. It's uncomfortable but it's safer to notice. Does that make sense? 

00:21:50
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:21:50
VANESSA JACKSON And so it's also, we're trying to understand this in the context of what, like your military training. And, and you know, also we talked before about how you, you spoken specifically about being a woman in the military and a black woman in the military and how you get to show up with all yourselves and you have to sort of perform better than the average dude, right. 

00:22:15
SHARYNA Yup. Absolutely. Got to be ten times better. 

00:22:20
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, pushes you further away from your authentic feelings. And so that, that's just another layer on top of healing that you have to do. 

00:22:30
SHARYNA So many layers. 

00:22:30
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, okay. But, but it is a lot of layers and it's frustrating and even maybe angry, then you got to work on so many layers. But that's why it's important to understand like your reaction is your action and it makes sense in the context and then you got these layers because you got, you got separated from all your feelings because you had to perform tougher because I'm a woman, I'm a black woman and people are waiting for me to not perform. So I got to be really tough which means, you put that shield up, just like your battle armor. 

00:23:05
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:23:10
VANESSA JACKSON And then you're having this, this, this emotional moment of vulnerability and you got to sort of take the armor off before you can even tend to the… Does that feel familiar? 

00:23:20
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:23:20
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. That's exhausting. It's really heavy. And so it's, it's about being able, for yourself to notice you're right to have a full range of feelings. To be able to notice that, you know, even orient yourself like, I'm not in, I'm not in the battle zone right now. It feels like a battle zone but let me stop and look around to say wait, I'm not in that. And, and how I take care of myself. There's opportunities now when you encounter something in this world to stop and, and process it even though it feels life threatening. So this is a lot… You see all these pieces that we have… 

00:24:05
SHARYNA Yeah, there's a lot. There's a lot that you have to… 

00:24:10
VANESSA JACKSON And so pay attention, that's why I want you to be really gentle on yourself. You said there's a lot of layers and so it's not like, oh, my God, I'm never gonna heal or I'm such a hot mess that I'll never be whole again. It just means, you're dealing with a lot of things that are intersecting on you processing your emotion. You got military training, you've got combat experience, you got, having to perform tougher because of your gender and your race. And so these are all pieces that make it more complex. It's not fair but it is what it is. 

00:24:45
SHARYNA Yeah. Okay. 

00:24:50
VANESSA JACKSON And you have a right to be irritated about that too. 

00:24:50
SHARYNA It just sounds exhausting but at the same time, I, I'm tired of the irritation and, and, I, I want to deal with all these that's going on inside, so… 

00:25:05
VANESSA JACKSON And I think the piece about the exhaustion is that, that means you also have to pace yourself because it is exhausting. It's like layers of armor, right? 

00:25:10
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:25:15
VANESSA JACKSON And so you're trying to move around and be flexible in your life and hug people and love, do all this armor and it is exhausting. Like, you're exhausted. And it's okay to be exhausted and even be irritated about the exhaustion. And so one of the things that makes me, that I want to talk about is… "Who else supports you and who else can get cultivated to support you and who will you allow to support you? Because you know, you're not supposed to do this by yourself, right. 

00:25:50
SHARYNA I know that but in practice that's a different thing. Umm… I'm usually the one that everybody goes to, to solve problems. I'm, I'm the oldest umm… among my brothers and sister. And you know, I can't go to them because they come, they are coming to me with all of their stuff, so… 

00:26:15
VANESSA JACKSON And, and this is another important piece, it helps to answer the other piece of irritation, like you're trying to heal yourself, you're here trying to sort of comeback from being in this very unusual environment and whole culture, the military culture and going back and being expected to walk around and cook food and talk to people and not act like your life wasn't turned upside down. 

00:26:40
SHARYNA Umm… 

00:26:40
VANESSA JACKSON And then on top of that you have people who are used to counting on you still coming and I suspect you're still used to being the person that's counted on. 

00:26:50
SHARYNA Yes, that's it. 

00:26:55
Shifting the pain by asking for help 

00:26:55
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, so and there's an opportunity here in all of these pain to sort of shift that a little bit, like, which… And I say that like it's really a positive thing and it is, but it's also going to do something super hard, right, which is learn how to ask for help. And if you've already done by comment, so let's, let's give you credit for that, that you've already reached out. But at the same time, it's about shifting some of the role that you've gone, gotten very used to, like being in control, whether it's a big sister and as officer or as what, you know, leader and yet what happens when that person needs some support. And how easy it's gonna be for you to be the person umm… who, in addition you're still doing that stuff is going to need some support. So who do you go to? 

00:27:50
[sil.] 

00:27:55
SHARYNA I don't really… I… Probably I should go to my husband, I mean, he's there but… 

00:28:05
VANESSA JACKSON How, how easy would that be? And what, what gets hard about going to your husband, since he's there? 

00:28:10
SHARYNA I think it's… He's got stuff going on too and I want to help him. So I don't want to bring myself that would add to his. It's just not… I guess it goes back to the shield and soothing up thing, it's just harder for me to do that with him. 

00:28:35
The gift in the trauma 

00:28:35
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, and, and his piece about it's the gift and the trauma, which is, it's an opportunity to transform that relationship where it could be maybe more reciprocal and, and he might have an opportunity to be supportive and nurturing of you and you might have the opportunity to lean. And he's he someone that you could trust to catch you. Okay, what happened with your body there? 

00:29:10
SHARYNA Umm… I don't, I don't know. I think, I'm just, I would probably rather be the person to, to catch and support and have to be caught. 

00:29:20
VANESSA JACKSON I know, I know. So this is the hard word. This is a new sort of background which is… And you don't have to give up. This is the thing. Is it, is it like, you got to give up the strength, you don't have to give up the leadership, you don't have to give up the big sister. You said, you're expanding it to say and I also need support. Which means you also let people be helpful to you and not just be umm… recipients of your care and which also means you got to practice trusting them and tolerating them doing it imperfectly to start. 

00:29:55
SHARYNA There it is. 

00:29:55
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, tell me more about there it is. 

00:30:00
SHARYNA Well, because, if I, if I do want to trust like my husband, he is so well meaning, but he can always do things, right. And so I would just rather do it myself and so I don't know if… Like with all the stuff we're talking about today and unpacking and it's hard for me to not judge myself and so to, it's hard for me not to think he might have a hard time like I'm having a hard time. 

00:30:30
VANESSA JACKSON And I think that's really important. And as I said, you figure out, there it is, that's the thing about and, and not to be want to be judged but also not to be want to be disappointed. So if I take the risk of sort of bringing this in, in my pain, in my confusion and in, in like overwhelming feelings, are overwhelming for you, you don't want to overwhelming. One thing that we can do with that is that, one we can do a, you know, some prep work about like at, figuring out, making sure you know what would be supportive, so that you're asking for specific things. But there's always a space for you to bring him in here and so in a ways that we can explain to him together. 

00:31:10
SHARYNA Okay. 

00:31:10
VANESSA JACKSON Uh… And have a, have a chance to ask some questions that I can maybe help him understand and that also for you to practice sharing some of what's going on internally for you with being present. How would that feel for you? 

00:31:25
SHARYNA I think that would be good. I think to have you here to help a guy because like I said earlier when you're asking me things I didn't even realize, you know, how I respond so that would help because to go to him, I wouldn't know how to… 

00:31:45
VANESSA JACKSON He's your world. Like you know, that's your, that's your role. This is a safe place and it's a real world, but that's your life. And being able to take your healing process into your life and have your life be supportive and the people in your life be supportive, would be like what's gonna long term support you. And so we can educate him and, and help train him better to be supportive. 

00:32:10
SHARYNA Train me and train him. 

00:32:15
VANESSA JACKSON Thank you. I'm so glad. I was gonna say that, but it was a matter that you said is, like, yeah, it's like training you to be more honest and open and vulnerable. 

00:32:20
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:32:25
VANESSA JACKSON And umm… and trusting that he's gonna receive and support you because it will be really scary if I put the stuff out and he shuts down or gets over too scared uh… And so I think it's really gonna be important for us to say, let's see what's going on. I guess, I'm understanding things, I'm gonna share with you this is what's going, you still got it, you're still responsible for the healing, but he can help co-create a space for you. The other thing to think about is umm… I've been thinking about maybe putting together a small group of three or four women, who are also women of color, who been in the military. 

00:33:00
SHARYNA Okay. 

00:33:05
VANESSA JACKSON To talk about their experience because what I'm hearing is that those are some very unique, because of the gender and race pieces, that it's unique experience that doesn't get talked about. 

00:33:15
SHARYNA Absolutely. 

00:33:15
VANESSA JACKSON You see vets on TV, there tend to be white men. 

00:33:20
SHARYNA Yes. 

00:33:20
VANESSA JACKSON And so… 

00:33:20
SHARYNA And that's not reality. 

00:33:25
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, it's not reality. And so what would it be like for you to have a small group of women where you guys could talk about your experience with people who have been in combat situations. You know, who would know pretty clearly and from a very visceral place what you're talking about. 

00:33:40
SHARYNA I think that would be good. Though, especially to talk about with the other women who've been in my position. Because it's unique and there's nothing like… That would help to be able to talk to someone as a similar… 

00:33:55
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, I think they just know. 

00:33:55
SHARYNA Background. 

00:33:55
VANESSA JACKSON They would know things and it would also be like a reality check, I think. That's one of the reasons why I'm thinking about putting this together because as I listen to you all, it's that, it's like no one, there's no mirrors for you. 

00:34:10
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:34:10
VANESSA JACKSON I like a reality check. 

00:34:10
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:34:10
VANESSA JACKSON As so you're talking about things that are not part of other people's life experiences and so it's just, it seems like how I make them understand. 

00:34:20
SHARYNA Yeah. 

00:34:20
VANESSA JACKSON And like, they think the world is all peaceful and I've seen this other side. 

00:34:25
SHARYNA Absolutely. That's it. 

00:34:25
VANESSA JACKSON And, and then you have… But then the other piece of that… Oh, we want to go back to how we started, where you talked about, like this no place of no peace. And so being able to create umm… a group conversation with other women vet around how you guys reclaim your peace and that you need to be with other people to do it. You need, does the internal work that you're gonna do, that you're already doing. And then there's a part about like needing to take that out to your outer world and have people that are helping you create a place of more peace and that's what you want for yourself. 

00:35:05
SHARYNA Yes. 

00:35:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, so we can think about the ways that we're gonna bring all these people, to bring you in and also take you out to the world. You got it? 

00:35:15
SHARYNA Okay. 

00:35:15
VANESSA JACKSON All right, good. 

00:35:20
Post Session Reflection 

00:35:25
VANESSA JACKSON And I was gonna offer some reflections on that session with Sharyna because I think she uh… raised some issues that are really important that oftentimes will make us, as therapists have to do something little different, because one of the things that was important for her to do uh… she had to learn how to ask for help. And I was able to offer her some ways to use the therapy to practice that. By one, creating space for her to bring her husband in so that they could, she could tell him what she needed and also help to educate him about what she's experiencing. And the other thing that became really important was to help her get connected with other uh… female veterans. And so for me being able to offer a group for her and for her to be open to that which I was really surprised that she was so open to that uh… but that for her, it would be a validating experience. So I think one of the things in the therapy with Sharyna that was important was, really trying to listen to what she needed and in some ways expanding the frame of my therapy to help create that, whether that was bringing her partner in or as helping her find a community of women who could really understand her experiences.
