SUSAN Christopher has to have things his own or so he believes, if he doesn't get his own way, he pushes everybody until he gets his own way, it was very frustrating, very upsetting. 

00:00:25
Can we stop now please? 

00:00:30
VALERIE No. 

00:00:30
You know she could be wonderful one minute, and then all of sudden, sometimes with no apparent reason, turns into all of a different person. 

00:00:35
OPPOSITIONAL defiant DISORDER 

00:00:40
NARRATOR Most parents have experienced behavior in their children that is resistant and at times defiant. This is typical of many young children and not out of the ordinary. However, when these negative interactions are chronic and disrupt the family life, the child may have a condition known as Oppositional Defiant Disorder, or ODD. 

00:01:00
understanding the Defiant child with Russell A. Barkley 

00:01:05
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY, PHD Professor of Psychiatry University of Massachusetts Medical Center Worcester, Massachusetts Hello, I'm Dr. Russell Barkley. I'm a professor of Psychiatry at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester, Massachusetts. Oppositional defiant disorder also known as ODD, is characterized by a pattern of negative, hostile and defiant behavior, lasting at least six months. Although it is common for children and parents to clash on occasion, ODD is marked by hundreds of negative interactions everyday. 

00:01:30
What is ODD? What causes ODD? Why treat ODD? A model for treatment 

00:01:35
NARRATOR This videotape will describe what ODD is? What causes it? And why it should be treated? Dr. Barkley's model for treating ODD will also be briefly presented. 

00:01:45
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY The goal of this program is to help clinicians and families understand the nature of Oppositional Defiant Disorder. And in the process, increase the opportunities for positive outcomes for their children. 

00:02:00
What is ODD? 

00:02:05
SUSAN You can't come up to that side. 

00:02:05
NARRATOR What do we mean by Oppositional Defiant Disorder? And how was this different from typical childhood behavior? First of all, it's important to understand that ODD occurs in a continuum ranging from mild "Non-Compliance", to outright "Defiance". 

00:02:20
NON-COMPLIANCE DEFIANCE NON-COMPLIANCE Child's failure to respond to a reasonable request from parent RELATIVELY PASSIVE 

00:02:20
NARRATOR Non-Compliance generally describes a child's failure to respond to a reasonable request from a parent, such as cleaning a bedroom or similar task. Non-Compliance is relatively passive in nature. 

00:02:35
SUSAN No, listen to me, did you put the things the way like I asked, the things that I handed to you the books, did you put them away? 

00:02:40
CHRISTOPHER No. 

00:02:40
DEFIANCE Refusal to comply with a reasonable request ACTIVE AND VOCAL 

00:02:45
NARRATOR The more extreme behavior associated with ODD is defiance, which is a more active and frequently vocal refusal to comply with a reasonable request. 

00:02:55
VALERIE No, I'm not cleaning my hand (inaudible ), I'm not going to, you know like no means. 

00:03:05
NARRATOR Keep in mind that most children will behave in this way at one time or another; however in children with ODD, it is the frequency and persistence of these behaviors that make them clinically significant. 

00:03:20
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY What are the behaviors most commonly associated with ODD, and how often must they occur for a child to be considered Oppositional? 

00:03:25
NARRATOR According to the DSM-IV, a child is considered to be oppositional defiant, if four of the following behaviors are displayed on a regular basis for a period of at least six months, these include. 

00:03:40
OPPOSITIONAL BEHAVIORS Loses his or her temper Argues with adults Defies or refuses adults' requests or rules Deliberately annoys people Blames others for his or her own mistakes Touchy or easily annoyed Angry and resentful Spiteful or vindictive 

00:03:40
NARRATOR If the child loses his or her temper, argues with adults, defies or refuses an adult's requests or rules, deliberately annoys people, blames others for his or her own mistakes or misbehaviors, he's touchy or easily annoyed by others, he's angry and resentful, he's spiteful or vindictive. 

00:04:00
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY In addition to these behaviors, there may also be significant impairment in social skills, academic performance and work related problems if the child is employed. Keep in mind that these behaviors are indicators of ODD, only if they occur more frequently than is usually seen in children of comparable age, and developmental level. 

00:04:25
NARRATOR These behaviors are used to define ODD, but there is more to the disorder that must be understood in order to fully comprehend it. 

00:04:30
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY This program will not simply focus on child Non-Compliance or Defiance, but on those social interactions and the family believe to have helped, at least partially develop or sustain the child's oppositional behavior. 

00:04:45
NARRATOR The nature of ODD is not adequately described, by behaviors children display. The manner in which parents react to those behaviors is equally significant. There is a very important aspect of ODD that also needs to be discussed in order to better understand the disorder. ODD is closely linked with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. In fact, the majority of children with ODD also have a ADHD as a comorbid condition. To help explain the nature of ODD, and the impact that disorder has on parents and children, several people have generously agreed to participate in the making of this videotape. 

00:05:30
SUSAN Okay, Christopher? 

00:05:30
CHRISTOPHER What? 

00:05:35
SUSAN Is that allowed in the house? 

00:05:35
CHRISTOPHER No. 

00:05:35
SUSAN No, so what are you thinking, need to go now? 

00:05:40
NARRATOR Christopher is nine years old, and has ODD. Both he and his brother Matthew have also been diagnosed with ADHD. 

00:05:45
SUSAN Thank you. 

00:05:50
NARRATOR Their mother Susan is a single working parent. She has a close relationship with her sons. 

00:05:55
SUSAN But you forgot to close the door? 

00:05:55
NARRATOR But finds the experience of raising them trying. 

00:06:00
SUSAN Excuse me. See this you forgot something. It was very frustrating to have children, who you just couldn't seem to have control over, and it was like, questioning your parenting skills, questioning what am I doing wrong? I've got to be doing something wrong, I don't have children who listen to me, I don't have children, who will do a simple task. 

00:06:30
Hmm…I would suggest lowering it a little bit, sugar will burn. 

00:06:35
NARRATOR Valerie is 12 years old. She was also diagnosed with ADHD. Valerie also has Oppositional Defiant Disorder. 

00:06:45
You, you, you, do you know what you means? 

00:06:50
Now, which one you're going to do? You're going to jump to the… 

00:06:55
ADHD is one thing but the oppositional behavior problems at home, another thing and they I think it, it makes it even more complex. 

00:07:00
We can… 

00:07:00
NARRATOR What is the difference between Non-Compliance and Defiance? 

00:07:05
You… 

00:07:05
SUSAN …or you can get the electric. The electric little thing. 

00:07:10
VALERIE No, you have to do it. 

00:07:10
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY A child's behavior is considered Non-compliant when he or she feels to appropriately respond to an adult reasonable request within an acceptable period of time. For example 15 seconds after the request or command is given. A child is also considered Non-Compliant when he or she fails to follow through on a request and finally Non-Compliance includes the failure to follow previously taught rules of conduct such as leaving their desk in class without permission, running off in a department store, lying or stealing, or hitting and swearing. 

00:07:45
SUSAN Hey Chris. 

00:07:45
CHRISTOPHER What? 

00:07:45
SUSAN I need you to put them down, we can leave. 

00:07:50
CHRISTOPHER Why? 

00:07:50
SUSAN Come on… 

00:07:55
NARRATOR Recognizing Oppositional Defiant Disorder is difficult, since many children exhibit these behaviors at sometime or other. 

00:08:00
SUSAN Over here, Matthew? 

00:08:00
They are really hyper, touching everything. 

00:08:05
Okay. I'll put it in your bag. 

00:08:10
SUSAN Now… 

00:08:10
It was up there. 

00:08:10
SUSAN Now, pick up that piece that you stepping on… 

00:08:15
SUSAN I actually thought that it was typical, at first instead of yeah well, there is a problem. Go right there to the door please, come on now pick it up, that is not okay. So it was like, I didn't take them out in public. I would do everything I could to stay home, because I was embarrassed at behavior, at their behavior and then in mine, because I was yelling in a public place. 

00:08:45
What are you doing? 

00:08:45
NARRATOR Defiance describes a situation, where in the child displays active resistance to a parents reasonable request. 

00:08:50
We got a leafy(ph) deck over here. 

00:08:55
VALERIE No. 

00:08:55
Oh, yes. 

00:08:55
VALERIE No. 

00:08:55
SUSAN We're going to sweep it off and get the… 

00:09:00
VALERIE No. 

00:09:00
NARRATOR This resistance may take the form of verbal refusal, temper outbursts, or sometimes physical aggression toward the parent. 

00:09:10
As a young child she was very aggressive. She was the one that would push, or grab a toy away, which you know when you do that, that is basically typical behavior, but she really never outgrew that. 

00:09:20
VALERIE What did I tell you? 

00:09:25
You told me you were hungry. 

00:09:25
NARRATOR Because it is difficult for parents to know whether a child's behavior is typical or not, seeking outside intervention may be a difficult decision for them to make. 

00:09:35
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY When should a parent consider seeking help for their child, remember that some Non-Compliant or Defiant behavior is normal for children, particularly those in the pre-school age group. It should not be thought of as abnormal and does not justify treatment. However, if at least two of the following conditions are present, then a child maybe in need of clinical intervention. 

00:09:55
CRITERIA FOR CLINICAL INTERVENTION The child's behavior is developmentally inappropriate and occurs to a greater degree than is common 

00:10:00
NARRATOR First, the child's behavior is developmentally inappropriate and occurs to a far greater degree than is common for children of this age group. 

00:10:05
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY This is usually established by having the parent fill out a form about the child's behavior since the child is likely to be at his or her worst in the home setting. 

00:10:15
NARRATOR Examples of this type of assessment form can be found in the manual that accompanies this videotape. 

00:10:25
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Similar reports from teachers may also be used to evaluate the developmental inappropriateness of the child's behavior. Additionally, the parent may be interviewed to see if the child displays symptoms of Oppositional Defiant Disorder. 

00:10:35
The child's behavior is causing an appreciable degree of impairment 

00:10:35
NARRATOR Second, the child's behavior is causing an appreciable degree of impairment. 

00:10:40
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY This means that the child's behavior is interfering with their capacity to meet age appropriate expectations. This includes self-care; trust and independence, interactions with family members and peers, acceptance of age appropriate responsibilities, such as chores and homework and the ability to follow through on rules without supervision. 

00:11:00
The child's behavior is resulting in emotional distress or harm for the child, parents, siblings, or peers 

00:11:05
NARRATOR Third, the child's behavior is resulting in a significant emotional distress or harm, either for the child or more likely for the parents, siblings, or peers. 

00:11:15
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY This may established by evaluating whether the child is unhappy with the state of affairs in the family or in their social life. Problems with parents and peers can be measured by enquiring of family members and teachers. But keep in mind many times, young children may not be unhappy or distressed by their own defiant behavior, because it gets them what they want in the short run, but in the long run, such behavior brings harm to the child in many ways, including greater family conflict, loss of friends, poor school performance and even risks for injury. 

00:11:50
SUSAN Okay. 

00:11:50
NARRATOR Christopher and Valerie's parents have sought outside help. This has enabled them to better understand their children's difficulties and at the same time to appreciate their positive attributes. 

00:12:00
Let just gives more to clean up you know, okay this one… She is a bright girl. She is smart, she has a lot to offer and if she is guided in the right direction, she has so much potential and I see good things but she needs help along the way. 

00:12:25
She is a very intelligent person, and I think she's gonna apply that intelligence to herself, and use it to help herself even more to get through these problems. 

00:12:40
SUSAN Christopher is very active, very easy going kid. He interacts really well with kids. He is very sweet, huggable, lovable, little boy loves cuddle time, that's a definite every day have to do it, it means a lot to him. 

00:13:00
NARRATOR It is important to differentiate typical childhood behavior from ODD, because once recognized and addressed, it is likely that other problems may be revealed as well. These include… 

00:13:10
ASSOCIATED PROBLEMS Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Conduct Disorder School underachievement and learning disabilities Poor social skills and peer relations Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Depression 

00:13:10
NARRATOR …attention deficit, hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, school underachievement and learning disabilities, poor social skills and peer relations, post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. While these associated problems are serious in and of themselves, attending to the behaviors directly associated with ODD will often bring about improvements in these areas as well. Once Oppositional Defiant Disorder is recognized, it is very important to seek treatment not only for the welfare of the child, but for their parent as well. 

00:13:50
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY The disorder was once described in this way, like a glacier the behaviors that makeup ODD move very slowly, but they can have a devastating long term effect on the landscape of the child and family's life. 

00:14:05
What causes ODD? 

00:14:10
SUSAN No, Christopher, look what you're doing please. 

00:14:10
CHRISTOPHER Okay. 

00:14:15
NARRATOR The roots of Oppositional Defiant Disorder are multiple. 

00:14:20
SUSAN Excuse me. 

00:14:20
CHRISTOPHER What? 

00:14:20
SUSAN I care, because now, can you get that knot out of there, without breaking your lace? 

00:14:25
NARRATOR The question often raised is, does ODD result from poor parenting or are some children born this way? The answer is that ODD seems to arise from a combination of both the parents temperament and the child's. 

00:14:40
SUSAN You forgot to cross it over. 

00:14:45
CHRISTOPHER No, and you have to do that. 

00:14:45
SUSAN Okay. I doubted my own parenting skills if I wasn't a good parent, if I was doing, what I had been doing all along with my other children, if I was doing anything right. 

00:15:00
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Well, there is a strong connection between the quality of the parent-child relationship and Oppositional Defiant Disorder. It would be unfair to characterize it as simply and solely reflecting in effective parenting abilities. In fact, ODD usually arises only when a particular combination of circumstances occurs. 

00:15:15
POSSIBLE CAUSES OF DEFIANCE 

00:15:20
NARRATOR To explain the underlying causes of Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Dr. Barkley uses a four factor model. The first factor is the parent's temperament. 

00:15:25
Parent temperament 

00:15:30
NARRATOR Non-Compliance in children often occurs if parents rely on inconsistent strategies, they do not provides sufficient reinforcement for positive behaviors. 

00:15:40
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Through inconsistent consequences given by parents, children achieve periodic success at avoiding demands. This in turn reinforces the child's use of oppositional or course of behavior. This can create a vicious cycle in which the child's defiant behavior feeds back and further adversely affects the parents' mood, sense of competence and self-esteem. 

00:16:05
SUSAN You know what it's early if we were home, you wouldn't be eating yet either, okay. I do not always respond very calm, cool and collected not(ph) to my children. I yell, because by the time I've said something 20 times, there is no calm about it, and so what you have on film is not the way I'm always, I'm with them. 

00:16:30
NARRATOR Children with difficult temperaments are likely to become more resistant when demands are made of them. Parents with similar temperaments become equally frustrated when their children refused to comply. This interaction of incompatible temperaments is often the first step in the development of Oppositional Defiant Disorder. 

00:16:50
Child temperament 

00:16:55
NARRATOR The second factor in this model is the temperament of the child. 

00:16:55
VALERIE You said by Friday, what's today? 

00:17:00
Are we a day off? 

00:17:00
VALERIE Yes. 

00:17:00
NARRATOR Temperament is something we are born with and there are children who are innately prone to highly emotional responses or, or highly active in attentive and impulsive common behaviors for children who have ADHD. 

00:17:15
I'd say when she was two or three years old, as when I first felt that there was something really wrong and then we went through a series of doctors and psychiatrist and analyst to help us figure out what's wrong and finally one of them thought that it might be ADHD and then when she just, when the, when that person started describing the condition I said that's it, that's what it is. 

00:17:35
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder such as overactivity, inattention, and impulsiveness are aspects of temperament that can be seen very easily in early childhood, but should these behaviors persist into the later school years. They are more likely to create parent child interaction conflicts. 

00:17:55
She was becoming very physical with the people in her family, constantly hitting, pushing just looking for stimulation. I never associated her bad behavior the impulse is I thought ADHD was a learning problem, but I understood now her behavior problems and why she needed to be stimulated all the time and uhm… I learned a lot. 

00:18:30
NARRATOR Understanding the role of the child's temperament in the development of ODD can contribute to improved relations between parent and child. 

00:18:40
I have learned a lot to anticipate her reactions, so I can uhm… I can judge how I'm going to handle things actually before they start, if it's been uhm… a trying day and I just anticipate the escalation, then I can avoid the situation altogether. She was very receptive, she likes one(ph) thing and she likes the physical comfort, so that helps a lot. 

00:19:05
Child management skills 

00:19:10
NARRATOR The next factor in this four factor model is the level of the parent's child management skills. This is particularly true when parents do not adequately monitor their children's activities. 

00:19:20
SUSAN I see something. 

00:19:20
CHRISTOPHER Where? 

00:19:25
SUSAN See the jacket yes, what do you think I would like that put. It gets very frustrating to have to repeat yourself, time and time and time again and you pretty much after move yourself to move your children. You have to get up and physically walk with them to make sure that they get the task done, whether it's a simple brush your teeth, or now it's time to go to bed. You know, please put your clothes away, normally we get, I did all in one drawer or he didn't in there, there half an hour later, because I didn't go and check. Unfortunately, I have learned through try whenever that, that's not the way to raise children. 

00:20:20
SUSAN You do this side, and I'll do this side, okay. 

00:20:25
NARRATOR Non-Compliance can be in effective method for avoiding unpleasant tasks. However, adequate monitoring of the child after a request is made may increase compliance. 

00:20:35
SUSAN Oh, yeah just like that. You do have to draw a line, certain limits and stay consistent with the limits you've set. You know, if ah… he didn't brush his teeth, he know, I would get up and check his teeth or walking back to the bathroom and stand there while he did, if he didn't take care of his laundry, I would stand there while he did. So there was no getting away from not doing what he was told to do. 

00:21:05
Family stress 

00:21:05
NARRATOR Finally, there are outside factors they can negatively impact on the parent-child relationship. 

00:21:15
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY Events surrounding the family both internal and external can create or contribute the increase risks for child defiant behavior. 

00:21:20
CONTRIBUTING FACTORS Single parenting Marital discord Economic stress Social adversity 

00:21:25
NARRATOR For example, Single parenting and the social isolation that often accompanies that is one such factor. Marital discord has also been linked to disruptive and defiant behavior, and the stress of economic status and social adversity can increase irritability in parents, putting children at further risk for developing and sustaining oppositional behavior. Most of the families referred for treatment of ODD will exhibit one or more of these characteristics. 

00:21:50
SUSAN Come on. 

00:21:55
Why treat ODD? 

00:22:00
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY There are many well established reasons for choosing defiance and its underlying family interactions as the focus of intervention. Among these are the increased risks for the following predicaments in which these children may find themselves. 

00:22:10
ODD OUTCOMES School underachievement Poor peer relations Delinquency Substance abuse School expulsion or dropping out Antisocial Personality Disorder Adult underemployment 

00:22:15
NARRATOR These are School underachievement, poor peer relations, delinquency, substance abuse, school expulsion or dropping out, antisocial personality disorder and adult underemployment. Besides, the potential for these future outcomes, there are other significant reasons for targeting defiance in children. 

00:22:35
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY First Non-Compliance or Defiance in various forms appears to be the most frequent complaint of families referring children especially boys to child mental health centers. Over a half of all referrals to such clinics are for oppositional or aggressive behavior and this figure raises to more than 74% if symptoms of ADHD are included. Second Non-Compliance underlies the majority of negative interactions between the family members and the referred child. A third reason for selecting Non-Compliance as a target is its greater pervasiveness across settings compare to other behavioral problem seen in children. Fourth, Non-Compliant behavior may have indirect effects on family functioning that may come back to detrimentally affect the psychological adjustment of the defiant child. As noted already, out of this impaired family management process the child rapidly acquires as a set of behaviors to use against the parent and other family members or even peers when they are instructed to do something they do not like to do. Finally, Non-Compliance and Defiant behavior in children appears to be highly stable over time, significantly predicting the persistence of this behavior pattern into adolescents. Childhood defiance or aggressiveness in fact maybe one of the most stable childhood behavioral disorders across development. 

00:24:05
NARRATOR There is a clear correlation between Oppositional Defiant Disorders and other behavioral problems. 

00:24:05
ADHD children not treated make up 80% of those diagnosed with ODD by age 12 

00:24:10
NARRATOR Research shows that children with ADHD, who are not adequately treated, make up 80% of those diagnosed with ODD by age 12. 

00:24:20
ODD children not treated make up 50% of those diagnosed with CD by age 16 

00:24:20
NARRATOR Children with ODD who are not adequately treated make up nearly 50% of those diagnosed with Conduct Disorder by age 16. 

00:24:25
CD children not treated form the majority of those diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder 

00:24:30
NARRATOR And children with Conduct Disorder who are not adequately treated go on to form the majority of those diagnosed with Antisocial Personality Disorder as young adults, manifested by highly aggressive and sometimes criminal behaviors. 

00:24:45
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY As you can see there is a significant correlation between early ADHD, the development of Oppositional Defiant Disorder and increasingly more difficult behaviors as these children mature. 

00:25:00
A model for treatment 

00:25:05
RUSSELL A. BARKLEY In this program, I have explained the nature of Oppositional Defiant Disorder, its causes and the compelling need to address these problems at the earliest possible stages in the child's development, but what can be done to accomplish this. 

00:25:20
SUSAN And one day I was working with them and I was tired and I was getting very kind of silly and she was just eating it right up, she was, we are just sitting and laughing about things and it's really changing things between us. 

00:25:35
NARRATOR There are a number of strategies that parents can employ to help them deal more effectively with their Non-Compliant and Defiant children. These strategies are usually taught in a series of parent training sessions conducted by mental health professional, who specialize in family dynamics. Dr. Gwen Edwards conducts training programs for parents of ODD children at the University of Massachusetts Medical Centre. 

00:26:00
GWEN H. EDWARDS, PHD Assistant Professor of Psychiatry University of Massachusetts Medical Center We know from not only the clinics here um… and our facility but from other mental health clinics around the country that the most common reason that a parent will take a child to a mental health clinic is because of behavior problems. It is the most common reason why people ask for help and the initial event that led them ahh… to, to ask for help often is because they just really can't, can't deal with the situation anymore themselves ahh… parents end up feeling embarrassed or self-conscious uh… because they can't take their child into public places without embarrassing things happen, ahh… they are hearing from teachers in school of the child's behavior is disrespectful or they violating rules in school ah… and so they come requesting help, because they finally reach the point where things that they have done just simply aren't helping anymore. 

00:26:55
NARRATOR Alex and Jim are the parents of a young boy who is diagnosed with ODD. Like many of these children, their son George also has ADHD. 

00:27:05
ALEX When you have an ADHD child you find yourself a kind of isolated and you know if you go to public places and the child acts up, you know you get the stares and, and the treatment of what's wrong with that kid, what's wrong with that couple, why don't they control that kid and just to know that there is other people that experienced the same thing and how they deal with, it is been, from my mental health tremendous uhm… 

00:27:30
JIM Our son is also ODD too so he has the Oppositional Defiant Disorder so, you just when you request anything it's never, he just does it. He, he will come back to you with something very negative or just downright mean and you take a step back and say what brought this on? Why is he treating us like this? He doesn't know why he's treating us like this, he can't figure that out, but it's up to us to manage that to help see it, pointed out to him and correct it. So that's what we've been working in here with. 

00:28:05
NARRATOR Sessions like these teach parents how to break the cycle of defiant behavior and inappropriate parental reactions. They are carefully planned out over a series of weeks and months. In each session parents are given specific tools and techniques to apply and these are reviewed at subsequence sessions. There is also time for parents to discuss their successes as well as any problems encountered since the previous meeting. Parent training program such as this, can be found in virtually all parts of the country.

GWEN H. EDWARDS A lot of parents enter our Parent Training Program ah… wondering why they are the ones in counseling or in treatment and will often ask well, why isn't my child are in treatment, why isn't my child in counseling and what I tell them is that the goal of treatment is to change them and if they change their child will change. The goal of our program is to change the parent's way of managing their child. So I'm after ultimately behavior change in the child, but I do so by way of changing the way that parents typically interact with their child.

GWEN H. EDWARDS Well, that's what I'm after is for all of you to become so familiar and so comfortable with doing this, that it, it second nature to you.

RUSSELL A. BARKLEY The principles of managing oppositional behavior are only briefly addressed in this program. If you would like more information, please know that there was a companion videotape "Managing the Defiant Child". In that program the principles of parent training are examined, demonstrated and discussed in far greater detail. Children become defiant in order to avoid performing unwanted request from their parents. In turn, parents escalate their own negative behavior toward the child in an effort to stop unwanted behaviors and get the child to comply. By understanding the nature of Oppositional Defiant Disorder, parents may not only improve their child management skills, but also enhance the quality of the relationship with their children.

SUSAN You can't do that, because that's a dangerous thing, okay. You have to say what you mean, and mean what you say, and once they learn that and it's not going to be overnight, it's going to take couple of months, but if you say what you mean, and mean what you say and follow up what you're saying, that's what changes the behavior. That's very tiring, but yet very rewarding in the long end uhm… to see that the progress it's been made, to know that I can tell them to do a simple task and having to do with.

Uhm…

VALERIE You do it. 

00:31:10
I think it's just by done… The best advice I've ever learned was that, if you want to change something in your child you have to change yourself first. And I wasn't willing to do it, this is my job and um… it makes me feel good about myself to be able to react to her positively and it teaches me uhm… how to respond really to the basic family and the other children as well, we all gained from it. 

00:31:40
You made a picture. 

00:31:40
That's okay. That's (inaudible ).
