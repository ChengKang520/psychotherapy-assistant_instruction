Specifics of Practice for Counseling with Latinos Dr. Patricia Arredondo Director, Empowerment Workshops Boston 

00:00:00
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO  Buenas tardes. I'm Patricia Arredondo and this afternoon, we are going to share with you a tape, videotape called "Specifics of Counseling with Latinos." This is a second in a videotape series designed to be used as an educational tool for those of us in the counseling profession. Our first tape series was called "Latino and Latina Counseling at Psychotherapy." In that particular tape, what we did was talk about many of the special considerations counselors need to, ah, take into account in working with the Latino population. As many of you know, the Latino population is, in fact, very diverse in terms of our ethnicity and our racial background. We are of all different phenotypes, ah, all different economic classes and consequently, represent a wide range in the American population today. Our previous tape, a spoke of the increasing population of Latinos. We are currently, according to the 1990 Census, numbering about 22.7 million. By the year 2020, it is projected that the population will be at about 42 million. It will become the largest minority group in the United States by that time. In the first videotape, we also talked about historical forces that have impacted the groups that consider themselves Latino in the United States today and the fact that most Latinos really are very nationalistic and prefer to refer to ourselves by our ethnic background, Dominican, Puerto Rican, Guatemalan, et cetera. We also talked in that video about cultural values and how much cultural values play a role in our cultural identity. Ah, some of the values include the centrality of the family, interdependence, allocentrism, personalismo, all values that are very much taught and practiced from an early age on, again, values that are communicated through the family. We also spoke about acculturation as a mediating factor in all, in the lives of families but also for individuals and how acculturation oftentimes makes a difference on how people move closer to the mainstream or again perhaps, prefer to maintain a greater sense of their ethnic and cultural identity. In that first video, we spoke about the role of religion and how religion has played a major force in gender socialization for women and for men. We defined the concepts of marianismo and machismo in that first series as well. So we're moving forward but I encourage you to review that first tape if you have not as yet seen it or perhaps pick up one of the chapters in one of our counseling books on counseling Latinos so that you have a better sense of the values. In this second tape that we are going to be, ah, showing you this evening, we will be working in a, a different modality. We will be introducing to you vignettes and role plays. Because of our limited time, we will introduce this but not have an opportunity to fully discuss some of the values that run through the discussions. Ah, we will highlight them and try to bring attention to them, ah, but we also encourage you to use your learning guide as the, ah, tool to better inform your discussions. Participating in this video are a number of my colleagues. Ah, some are from the counseling profession and others have, ah, graciously agreed to be participants in this. Ah, playing the role of counselors are Dr. Elsa Orjuela-Casas and Dr. Linda Manjarrez. In the role of participants are Catalina Moreno, Eric Liriano, Gloria Cardona, and Diana Ubinas. Are all of us with the exception of Dr. Manjarrez are of Latino heritage, ah, from backgrounds such as Guatemalan, Dominican, Puerto Rican, and Columbian and Mexican as well, for myself. What we will do in these videos again is enact, ah, scenarios that are, are not so unusual in counseling. Ah, the only difference is that the focus will be on a client who happens to be of Latino heritage. Now, one other thing that you will notice about these particular videos, all of the participants and all of the, ah, scenes really are depicting people who we would call "more high achieving." And what I have found in, in most representations in the literature about Latinos is that a very little focus is given to Latinos and Latinas who are of, ah, strong educational backgrounds and who are professionals. So this will be a different type of video in that regard because all of the individual participants and their stories, ah, speak of in, ah, speak of folks who have strong educational backgrounds and who are, are high-achieving. We will do a subsequent video which would probably take place in, in, in a middle-house setting where the economic differences would be more notable. And so, I think that's again another important factor and variable to keep in mind, our economic differences and how much that does have an effect on what people see as their opportunities in, ah, in life. We are now about to begin our vignettes. I encourage you to use your learning guide and follow along. Vignette number one talks about Sarah Bonias(ph), a college freshman whose heart is at home and not in the academics. Let me tell you a little bit about Sarah. Sarah is a college freshman at an Eastern Ivy League College, of a Mexican-American heritage. She's originally from Tuscan, Arizona where she was class valedictorian. She had many college scholarship offers but decided to attend an all-women's institution, much to the approval of her parents. Sarah is the oldest daughter of six children. She did very well in her first semester, earning a 3.5 grade point average. She is now back from winter break. Sarah was referred by the student health center. She went there complaining about headaches, tiredness, and a lack of interest in her studies. In fact, she reported that her grades were beginning to drop. She had failed a few of her preliminary quizzes so she had some concerns but she also wasn't feeling good. Not finding any physical explanation for these symptoms, the physician referred Sarah to Dr. Casas, the part-time counselor at the college counseling center. Let's watch their interaction now. 

00:07:45
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS  Hello Sarah.

00:10:50
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Just being around her- (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
SARAH - just, yeah. 

00:10:50
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS - or helping her out? I mean, how. (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
SARAH I mean, just being there. Just feel, I don't feel like I'm part of the family, being all the way over here. 

00:10:55
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS I see. 

00:10:55
SARAH And, uhm, I just feel really separated from them, when I was, I went back home, I just saw how my younger brother had kinda grown and I kinda miss that. 

00:11:05
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Uh-huh. 

00:11:05
SARAH I mean, he was, he started first grade and he's the youngest in the family. 

00:11:10
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS I see, I see. How many, how many brothers and sisters do you have? 

00:11:10
SARAH  I'm the oldest of six. 

00:11:15
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Oh, wow. 

00:11:15
SARAH So, I have five younger- (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Yeah, I see. 

00:11:15
SARAH - brothers and sisters. 

00:11:15
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Did you, did you feel that, that, uhm, by you, being away from home that somehow your parents were forgetting about you? 

00:11:25
SARAH Oh, no. 

00:11:25
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Or that you're no longer were(ph) important, you know, how? 

00:11:25
SARAH I know, I know my, oh God, I know that I'm important to my family. (crosstalk) 

00:11:30
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Yeah. 

00:11:30
SARAH But uhm, I just think that, I don't know why being here, at first I thought you know, going away to school, I get the best opportunities. 

00:11:35
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Hmm. 

00:11:35
SARAH  And this is, this,- (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS I know. I understand you. 

00:11:40
SARAH - this way I could help my family when I graduate et cetera, but uhm, I keep thinking about it, maybe I'm not really helping them being here, right now. 

00:11:50
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Uh hmm. 

00:11:50
SARAH I keep going back and forth with that. I don't know. Maybe this is why I have had like always headaches and everything,- (crosstalk) 

00:11:55
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Uh hmm. 

00:11:55
SARAH - I keep thinking about this stuff. 

00:11:55
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS And that in one hand, you, you want to, uhm, continue on with your education because in the long run, it's gonna be helpful for your family. 

00:12:00
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:12:00
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS  But on the other hand, right now, you want to be there because practically, you would be- (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
SARAH Yeah. 

00:12:05
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS - ah, helping your mom. 

00:12:10
SARAH Yeah. 

00:12:10
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Wow, so you've been doing this back and forth? 

00:12:10
SARAH Yeah, maybe that's why, yeah. Maybe- (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Maybe that's why you have headache, yeah? 

00:12:15
SARAH - Dr. Keith(ph) was right. Uh hmm. But, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Well, it, did he say something about the reason why you have a headache or (inaudible )? 

00:12:21
SARAH I, I don't know why, you know, I mean, I, maybe I knew, I just felt weird coming to you- (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Yeah. 

00:12:25
SARAH - and like, I don't know, like my family we will, usually don't go and see counselors (laughing) and so, it's kinda different for me. 

00:12:30
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Does your family know that you're coming to see me then? 

00:12:30
SARAH No. 

00:12:30
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS No. 

00:12:30
SARAH  Not at all. 

00:12:35
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS I see. 

00:12:35
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO We are now ready to debrief this first role play. For each vignette you will see, there will be an opportunity to pause, and do this kind of dialogue in your class. You have five questions on your study guide that I encourage you to follow. In this particular debriefing, I'm going to ask the two participants to stay in their role as counselor and client and I'll ask them a couple of questions that will help us understand how it was to be in that role. Two Latinas working together, if you would, Dr. Casas, the therapist who is of Latina heritage and Sarah, the client of Mexican-American heritage. Let me start by asking Sarah. At what point did you find that Dr. Casas made a connection to you? 

00:13:25
SARAH  Uhm, I think far in the beginning, when she, I said I was really nervous about being there. She goes, "Yeah, I understand how you feel," and I think that maybe it made me a little bit more comfortable to know that she understood how I felt nervous being there talking to a stranger. 

00:13:40
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO At what point did you think she connected to you, uhm, as a, a woman of Mexican-American heritage? What, what might she have said that, uhm, gave you a sense that she understood and, and knew that? 

00:14:00
SARAH Oh God, I can't think of anything ah, right now that had, I think one of the things she could have said was, at just by looking at her, I knew she was Latina. 

00:14:05
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO  Uh hmm. 

00:14:10
SARAH So, that made me more comfortable, just knowing that she was Latina, being there. 

00:14:15
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:14:15
SARAH Uhm, God, I can't remember anything specific. 

00:14:15
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO But that's the(ph), I think you're, you're mentioning something- (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
SARAH Yes. 

00:14:20
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - that's important, that sense of knowing. 

00:14:20
SARAH Yes. 

00:14:20
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Uh hmm. 

00:14:20
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Just by looking at another person if you are from similar cultural background. 

00:14:25
SARAH Yes, okay,- (crosstalk) 

00:14:25
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Okay. 

00:14:25
SARAH - just being there. 

00:14:30
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Ah, Dr. Casas, what were the cultural issues you heard in Sarah's story? 

00:14:35
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Uhm, actually two that came up and, and that, that, uhm, tends to come up a lot and that is the, the, the conflict that students tend to have, ah, even though they might be excellent students, ah, of having to fulfill their own needs and pursue their own goals and also meet their family's needs. And, and, and that issue tends to happen a lot. Uhm, being responsible for their family,- (crosstalk) 

00:15:05
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:15:05
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS - ah, ah, at the moment, ah, the present time and at the same time, uhm, also feeling responsible to feel, to fulfill their needs and their future roles that are they are going to be obviously part of the family's responsibility- (crosstalk) 

00:15:20
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:15:20
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS - and their responsibility to, to the family. 

00:15:20
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO  We heard in, in, in Sarah's story, some of the loyalty towards family- (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Uh hmm. Uh hmm 

00:15:30
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - uhm, some of what we call as a value allocentrism. 

00:15:30
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS  Uh hmm. 

00:15:35
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO You know, the sense of interdependency and, and relationship,- (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Uh hmm. 

00:15:35
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - value of relationship,- (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - ah, that goes beyond oneself. Was, Dr. Casas, was Sarah's story been different if she were, uhm, a man, a male freshman? 

00:15:50
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Someone, yes, ah, and the reason is that it would not, even though it might be a little, a little different, uhm, mainly because of him being a male,- (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:16:00
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS - ah, would not be concern, concerned about helping mom. It would be perhaps, ah, being with the family,- (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS - as a family member. But not so much as, as helping the mom and, and being responsible to fulfill that,- (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
SARAH Yeah. 

00:16:15
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS - that need,- (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:16:20
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS - so. (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Is there, uhm, something else that you would observe uhm, Sarah that coming from your cultural background- (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
 Yeah. 

00:16:25
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - and, and, uhm, being in college was, was important for a counselor to understand about you? 

00:16:35
SARAH I think, just from the, uhm, beginning when she said she was uncomfortable being in there. That's really important, I think, because (inaudible ) like a lot of times you don't explo, you know, expose your family problems or your issues to strangers so that's something kinda loyalty to the family that you don't talk to other people about your issues. I think that's something that you should be conscious about. 

00:16:55
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:16:55
SARAH Dealing with things. (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO For, for a counselor- (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
SARAH Yes. 

00:16:55
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - to need to be conscious of that- (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:16:55
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - for a, a Latina coming in- (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
SARAH Yes. 

00:17:00
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - to the counseling center. 

00:17:00
SARAH Uh hmm. And also the attachment to the family and the connection and the import, the importance of that. That's really important of being part of the family. 

00:17:10
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO And we know that in Latino culture, ah, the family is really accord to- (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - one's identity- (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
 Uh hmm, hmm. 

00:17:15
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - and to, again, the, the meaning one makes in life- (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - quite often. 

00:17:15
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS  Uh hmm. 

00:17:20
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO What I'd like now to do is, ah, ask- (crosstalk) 

00:17:20
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Ask. 

00:17:20
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - Dr. Casas, you wanna comment again? 

00:17:25
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Yeah, I, the, the, the comment that uhm, that I want to make was, uhm, ah, when Sarah was talking about, uhm, feeling, in somewhat disloyal to the family, that she was in some ways embarking in any world and enjoying it and, and also if you mean that probably a little bit guilty, uhm, that, that she was coming to talk about the family and the family didn't know about it. 

00:17:45
SARAH Uh hmm. 

00:17:45
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Yeah, (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:17:49
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO That's not unusual is it to, to have that sense of guilt uhm,- (crosstalk) 

00:17:50
SARAH Yeah. 

00:17:50
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - you, you really again want to share your burden or release your burden. But- (crosstalk) 

00:17:55
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Yeah(ph). 

00:17:55
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - on, on the other hand, it, it may feel like there's some disloyalty- (crosstalk) 

00:18:00
 Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:18:00
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - going on by doing that. We're gonna move to just highlight some of the learning points that had come from this first vignette and encourage you to turn to your study guide. The first learning point to keep in mind that Latino culture is primarily allocentric. It means that concerned for others are part of one's normative way of seeing relationships, and I stress the word normative. Second, that Latinos, especially the oldest daughter, are socialized to be mother's right hand. They assume many caretaking responsibilities. Third, women typically remain at home before marrying. This expectation persist even with second and third generation families. Fourth, in Latino culture, one does not air problems with strangers as we've heard. And fifth, Latino culture stresses family loyalty and interdependence versus individualism, particularly for women. And again, I encourage you to dialogue about this in your class, keeping in mind some of the Eurocentric models that we've all learned and to see where there maybe points of conflict with some of the Latino cultural values and models. Vignette number two features a young couple, a young professional couple. Sophia Aravelo and Raul dela Cruz have been experiencing stress due to Raul's unemployment. His wife Sophia is feeling the brunt of the workload. She's needing to work excessive hours and put off her professional plans. Let's give you a little background about Sophia and Raul. They met at college and have been married for two years. Both came to the United States during high school from Columbia and the Dominican Republic respectively. They started dating while in college and married two years after graduation. Sophia is a psychiatric nurse. Raul recently completed his M.B.A. with the specialization in financial operations. He's been looking for the right job. Knowing that he's a Latino, he is really, ah, rarely in the field so he's trying to hold out for the right job. Sophia persuaded Raul to go to see the counselor because she has refused to continue to work over time. He claims that she needs to trust him, tener confianza, that he will take care of her as soon as the right job is offered to him. The therapist, Dr. Casas, who they will visit is also of Columbian heritage. 

00:20:50
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS  Buenas tardes. Como estas(ph)? (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
SOPHIA ARAVELO Buenas tardes. Muy(ph) bien.

00:21:01
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Uhm, Sophia, you made the appointment to come, ah, today. Can you tell me a little bit about what's going on? 

00:21:05
SOPHIA ARAVELO Sure. Uhm, it took a long time for him to come. I'm trying to convince him to come. 

00:21:10

SOPHIA ARAVELO Ah, I've been working in the hospital weekends and nights and I'm just very tired of working. 

00:21:25
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS  Uh hmm. 

00:21:30

00:21:45
RAUL DELA CRUZ  Yes, but what I, I'd like Sophia to understand is that this is very temporary and that once I find the job that, that I'm looking for and that's enough for me to be able to support her- (crosstalk) 

00:22:00
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Uh hmm. 

00:22:00
RAUL DELA CRUZ - the way that, that I, I want to and the, the way that I'm intended to. So that she will be able to go to school and if she wants to take some time off, she'll be able to do that. 

00:22:10
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Uh hmm. So you see that's a temporary- (crosstalk) 

00:22:15

00:23:20
SOPHIA ARAVELO - we came here.

RAUL DELA CRUZ  Well, I, I understand- (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:23:35
RAUL DELA CRUZ - but, uhm, if she could be just a little more patient. Uhm, I, I think that it'll be great, uhm, and, and what I'm saying. (crosstalk) 

00:23:45

00:24:05
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Take care of her? 

00:24:05
RAUL DELA CRUZ Of course. 

00:24:05
SOPHIA ARAVELO Mean, meanwhile,- (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS What's.. (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
SOPHIA ARAVELO - why don't you get a job that just.. (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Yeah. What's preventing you from getting a job or from doing, from taking care of her, from taking, doing what you would like? Or what you would like her to do? 

00:24:15
RAUL DELA CRUZ Well, yeah, I mean, it, it's, it's just the matter that I've gotten a couple of job offers but I, I really would like a job that will ah, allow her to go to school and, and to ah, or, or stay home if she'd like for, for a while. Uhm, and, and all of that. So, what I want that, that right job basically, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS You want the right job? (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
RAUL DELA CRUZ Right. (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS I see. 

00:24:35
RAUL DELA CRUZ Yes. 

00:24:35
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS  And, and.. (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
SOPHIA ARAVELO That's really upsetting me from.. (crosstalk)

00:25:05
RAUL DELA CRUZ I'm, and I, I think that, I mean, that's the way I was brought up and I, I don't see that there is nothing wrong with that. 

00:25:10
SOPHIA ARAVELO Honey but maybe you can- (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Could you.. (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
SOPHIA ARAVELO - get a temporary job until you get the one that you'd really want. For a few months, you know, and, and 'coz I just wanna take a break. I'm tired of all of these(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS You're tired? 

00:25:15
SOPHIA ARAVELO And also in arguing everyday, everyday. 

00:25:20
RAUL DELA CRUZ Well, you see before, we didn't argue and, and when we first get married. Lately, I just don't know what's going on. It's like,- (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Uh hmm. 

00:25:30
RAUL DELA CRUZ - you know, she's, she's,- (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS You don't understand that, that she's upset and she's tired and she's not happy- (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
RAUL DELA CRUZ Yeah. 

00:25:35
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS - with the situation? 

00:25:35
RAUL DELA CRUZ Yeah(ph). Ah, you mean, she's becoming very Americanized that I think in, in, in terms of, you know, because she is working and, and I'm not and now she's raising her voice at me and, and that to her father the other day. 

00:25:45
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Uh-huh. 

00:25:45
RAUL DELA CRUZ So, you know, lately, it, it's been a little more, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS This is unusual? 

00:25:50
RAUL DELA CRUZ Of course. 

00:25:50
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Is that what you're saying? 

00:25:55
RAUL DELA CRUZ Yes. 

00:25:55
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Uh-huh, uh-huh. And why do you think that she's doing that? 

00:25:55
RAUL DELA CRUZ Well, I, I, I think that because she's the one working and, and, and maybe because she's making more friends at, at work and- (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS I see. 

00:26:05
SOPHIA ARAVELO Is this.. (crosstalk) 

00:26:05
RAUL DELA CRUZ - it's, it's just taking on a, a different persona than, than,- (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
SOPHIA ARAVELO No,- (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS I see. 

00:26:10
RAUL DELA CRUZ - than who she was. 

00:26:10
SOPHIA ARAVELO - no, it's not only that, honey. It's my health. I mean, I've be working so hard. I've, I've been losing weight and I also wanna go back to college. I wanna get my masters- (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:26:20
SOPHIA ARAVELO - and there's something that I, that I really wanna do now. 

00:26:25
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO  We're now going to begin the debriefing of the vignette number two. I'd like to make a couple of observations before we talk to the participants. One is you will notice the seeming comfort that they all shared once Dr. Casas opened the dialogue in Spanish and they responded accordingly. This was a signal that was, it was acceptable to communicate bilingually. Ah, the second point that you might have noticed was the communication between the couple and how there were some references or some language in Spanish that both, again individual shared. And again, it was a common denominator for the group. I'd like now to talk to our participants and asked for your feedback on the role you played. Let's begin with Raul. Ah, you mentioned, or actually Sophia mentioned that she had really tried to bring you in and you had finally agreed to come in to this counseling session. Can you, you tell us what it was about coming to counseling for you that was an issue? 

00:27:35
RAUL DELA CRUZ Sure. I, I think that is a little bit difficult, I mean, be-, because I know the, uhm, the culture here and everything, I understand that going to a counselor is not the-, a major uhm, disaster but, uhm, so a lot of the people that I know, especially the ones who had maybe a lower degree of education. I mean, you only go to see a psychiatrist when, when you really have the uhm, psychological problems and, ah, so it, it was a little difficult for me in terms of my issue, it's finding a, a job and, and not really that we have problems. 

00:28:10
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO  So there's a stigma attached with going for help- (crosstalk) 

00:28:15
RAUL DELA CRUZ Yes. 

00:28:15
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - ah, to a psychologist or to a counselor as you say? 

00:28:20
RAUL DELA CRUZ Yes. 

00:28:20
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uhm, Sophia, how was it for you to come to a counseling session and admit that you were having problems in your marriage? 

00:28:30
SOPHIA ARAVELO Well, it was a little embarrassing but I know that maybe a third person can help us. I, I really want our marriage to work out. 

00:28:40
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
SOPHIA ARAVELO At the same time, uhm, ah, Latino women are not used to support the family. It's the man who is the one who supports the family. In this case, he's not. I'm the one who supports, supporting both of us. And- (crosstalk) 

00:28:55
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO And that's very different from how- (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
SOPHIA ARAVELO - brought(ph) us, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - you were brought up and, and the example from your parents. 

00:29:00
SOPHIA ARAVELO Yes. 

00:29:00
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO  Apparently. Dr. Casas, what cultural issues did you pick up as we role play here? 

00:29:10
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Well, uhm, both, particularly the, the, uhm, gender issues and, and, family responsibility that I think Sophia just pointed to and that is that, uhm, in the Latino cultures, it's, it's the men who takes on the role of supporting the family and here it was switched where she is the, the, the breadwinner and not only with one job but two jobs which makes her feel, on the one hand, empowered and I think that that was what's, what's going on with Raul. He was picking up on the sense of empowerment for her, but on the other hand, the, the burden, ah, not only the physical, uhm, the, the physical part or aspect of the job but also the embarrassment for the family that she's doing something that it's culturally not perceived as, as correct. 

00:30:05
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh-huh. There's a word in Spanish that I know we're all familiar with it and the word is vergüenza, uhm, or shame. Ah, was any of that operating for either of you in, in this particular counseling session? 

00:30:20
RAUL DELA CRUZ We-, well, uhm, in, in coming here, uhm, you know, obviously we didn't discuss it with, with the members of my family and, and her parents or anything. So, uhm, because, you know, we, we don't want to, to let anybody know that we're coming. 

00:30:35
SOPHIA ARAVELO  I think, uhm, Raul feels a little bit of vergüenza of coming here because of ah, his macho-, machismo role in the society. Ah, he and I think ah, I'm right if I, if I tell you that ah, you're a little macho and that's what society and old(ph) culture say so. 

00:31:00
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO  That's the expectation- (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
SOPHIA ARAVELO That's the expectation, yeah. 

00:31:05
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - in other words. Dr. Casas, in this particular scenario with this couple, ah, was there, ah, what were the strengths that you saw between them? I mean, clearly they came in with presenting a problem. 

00:31:20
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS Hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uhm, what were the strengths? (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS I think their biggest strengths were the fact that she was able to convince him to come to, to, to therapy. I think that, that she was obviously a very ah, influential, ah, ah, person in this relationship and he- (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
DR. ELSA ORJUELA-CASAS - obviously allowed that and, and that's wonderful. The fact that they have come into therapy, ah, is, is obviously a good thing for them. 

00:31:45
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO There are strengths in a relationship and those strengths oftentimes to, ah, a therapist who is not familiar with the Latino culture ah, may lie invisible because they are known to one another. And in Dr. Casas' comments, we heard some of the strengths that she heard between the two participants. Let me just briefly highlight a couple of the learning points. We talked about in the debriefing about the machismo and how, how that means that the man wants to be the breadwinner for the family, wants to take care of his family. The other issue that we didn't have a chance to really debrief was, ah, that factor of Americanization that Raul referred to, ah, talking about Sophia about being more Americanized. We know that acculturation is a factor within couples, within families and it's a variable that needs to be understood by a counselor because we may set expectations based on the acculturation of one individual over another. A third point that I wanna make sure we highlight is that a family. There are family pressures on a couple and these family pressures can induce guilt, shame and embarrassment. There are expectations. There are norms individuals have to live up to in terms of the family's eyes. And, and as very strong Latino cultural value is what we call orgullo or pride. And for both Raul and for Sophia, orgullo was very important to them and to their families. 

00:33:25

00:33:25
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO  This is vignette number three and we have a work situation that we're going to role play for you. Gloria is the manager of a management information system and she finds she is hitting the glass ceiling. Let's tell you a little bit about Gloria's situation. She's been working for U.S.A Insurers for the past six years. During this time, she has had two promotions, one that was a definite advancement with an increase in salary and the second that was more of a lateral move. She has consistently received excellent evaluations indicating that she is qualified for a promotion. Gloria is bilingual enabling her to communicate with vendors from Spanish-speaking countries. This is not part of her job description but she does it willingly whenever request is made. Each time she approaches her boss, Hank(ph), he tells her to be patient. He knows she wants a promotion but he tells her she is doing a good job and that she needs to wait for the appropriate position not just any position. Gloria is beginning to wonder if her boss is being honest with her. She has seen new comers, people who came after her promoted. All of them are white. Hank(ph) is a nice man to work with. So Gloria wonders if she's being too pushy or is she really not qualified. Let's hear her talk about her dilemma in this next role play. 

00:35:10
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ  Hi, Gloria. I'm Dr. Man. 

00:35:15
GLORIA Nice to meet you, Dr. Man. (crosstalk) 

00:35:15
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Nice to see. What, what brings you here today? 

00:35:20
GLORIA Uhm, well, ah, let's see. I would like to get something off my chest, ah- (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ  Absolutely. 

00:35:30
GLORIA Ah. 

00:35:30
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Absolutely. 

00:35:30
GLORIA I'm here, uhm, because I need to talk to someone. (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:35:35
GLORIA And I, my first choice would have been a Latina or a Latino, ah, therapist but that wasn't possible. (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ That is, yeah, so you ended up with this blonde-haired, blue-eyed person and- (crosstalk) 

00:35:45
GLORIA Uh-huh 

00:35:45
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ - and what? 

00:35:45
GLORIA  Well, uhm, I guess that ah, I wanted a Latino because, ah, I, I felt more, that they would be more ah, able to understand what I have to say here but- (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:36:00
GLORIA - ah, we'll try then and we'll see how it goes. 

00:36:00
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Yeah, well, well, tell me what you think about this? Let's, let's give it a shot for this,- (crosstalk) 

00:36:10
GLORIA Uh hmm. 

00:36:10
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ - this first session and then we can set aside some time at the end and if you think it's a match, that's fine and if it's not then, you know, maybe I can help you,- (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
GLORIA Uh-huh. 

00:36:20
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ - uhm, get connected with a Latino or a Latina counselor. How does that, how does that sound? 

00:36:25
GLORIA It sounds good. 

00:36:25
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
GLORIA It sounds good. (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Okay. And, and by the way, it's good- (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
GLORIA Uh hmm. 

00:36:25
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ  that you are able to, sort of, get that out of the way. 

00:36:30
GLORIA  Thank you. 

00:36:35
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ You're welcome. 

00:36:35
GLORIA Ah, well, as, as I said, ah, as, when I talked to you over the phone- (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:36:40
GLORIA Uhm, I'm having a lot of trouble at work and I think that, basically, I think that my, my, my boss, Hank(ph), is discriminating against me. 

00:36:50
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:36:50
GLORIA  I have been at this job for the last six years. 

00:36:55
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ That's a lot of time. (crosstalk) 

00:36:55
GLORIA And, yeah, and I like the job a lot and I think I do a great,- (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:37:00
GLORIA  a great job over there, ah. 

00:37:05
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ What exactly is your job? 

00:37:05
GLORIA I'm a manager at, uhm, at an insurance company at- (crosstalk) 

00:37:10
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:37:10
GLORIA - an MIS department and- (crosstalk) 

00:37:15
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ exc-, can I just, is that the same insurance company that said they didn't have any Hispanic counselors available for you? 

00:37:20
GLORIA It's the same one, yes. 

00:37:20
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Yes(ph), I just couldn't miss it. (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
GLORIA Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Okay. Go ahead. I'm sorry. 

00:37:25
GLORIA Ah, I have been there for six years. I have had two promotions. 

00:37:30
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:37:30
GLORIA Ah, one of them, the first one was a very good promotion. I was very happy. I thought I was going some place, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Yeah. 

00:37:40
GLORIA - the second one was just a lateral promotion. 

00:37:40
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:37:40
GLORIA And since I've been there, ah, I have had a very good, uhm, elevations every year. Ah, I'm very happy. My boss says that he's very happy with my performance. And, ah, but when there is time to promote, I don't get the promotions. (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ You didn't get the promotion. 

00:38:00
GLORIA  I applied for them. I, I have been working hard. 

00:38:05
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:38:05
GLORIA Because I do want the promotions, I, I feel that I like my job and I would like, uhm, to get some place with it. What I- (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ And, go ahead. I'm sorry. 

00:38:15
GLORIA I don't get anywhere. 

00:38:20
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ And, and have I assumed that you've discussed this with your boss? 

00:38:20
GLORIA  Yes, uhm, I have- (crosstalk) 

00:38:25
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ And he says? 

00:38:25
GLORIA He, he just doesn't get it. I don't think that he, he gets what's going on. He says that, ah, it's not my time yet that when that might, you know, my job gets, ah, a go-, when he sees a good job for me, he'll let me know and, and I have been just waiting and waiting and nothing happens. 

00:38:45
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ What do you think the real story is? 

00:38:50
GLORIA Well, you know, I'm in this office. I look very different. I, I, I have an accent. I, I'm even in the end of the hall 'coz he's, I'm not in the place where, ah, people walk in and, and they are able to see me. 

00:39:05
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ So that's, sort of, out of the mainstream? 

00:39:10
GLORIA Yes, I am, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Right. 

00:39:10
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ - at the end of the hall, hallway and, ah, I feel that he, he doesn't think that I'm able to do my job and, and it's, it's all because I have an accent, because I look different and, and- (crosstalk) 

00:39:25
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ So you- (crosstalk) 

00:39:25
GLORIA - perhaps I behave in a way that he's- (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ So even though he says that the appropriate position for you hasn't come along, in your heart of hearts what you really believing or thinking is that it's more personal. It's more about you, uhm. 

00:39:45
GLORIA It's about how I look. It's about how I act. It's about how I dress and- (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Have you taken that to him? 

00:39:50
GLORIA Well, he's a nice guy, you know, and, ah, I like working for him and- (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:39:55
GLORIA - it's not that this is a terrible place to work at. I have been trying to make it clear to him that I, I want a job promotion that I needed. And, and that, that would be the only, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:40:10
GLORIA - way that they can, ah, hold me in that position for a while longer. That hasn't worked. 

00:40:15
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ  That hasn't worked. (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
GLORIA So, I think that it's time for me either to talk to him directly about it and, and bring up, ah, the issue of how I feel and, and how I have been discriminated or I'll have just to look for another job. 

00:40:35
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ So, so it's either sit down and talk with him, or look for a job and find one and then give your resignation? 

00:40:45
GLORIA I guess so. It's not that, that easy to talk, ah, to him. I have been talking to people around, uhm, ah, the people I work with. And they don't feel that I have any, any, anything to worry about. They, they think that Hank(ph), that's my, my boss,- (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Yes. 

00:41:05
GLORIA - likes me and, and that it's just a matter of not having had the right, ah, opportunity. 

00:41:10
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Did you, sort of wonder in your heart of hearts how it was he knew what would be the best job for you? As opposed to maybe you being cued in on that. 

00:41:20
GLORIA  Well, I think I know what, what my, ah, the type of job that I'm, I'm, I'm able to do, and those are the jobs that I have to. 

00:41:30
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO  In Vignette number three. There were some very interesting issues that came up for the client. And I'd like to begin the processing by asking Dr. Man, how it felt to be told by the client that you were not the counselor of choice? 

00:41:50
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Well, actually it's fine. Because if it hadn't been expressed, there would've been a tension, a certain tension in the session and she might not have been able to, uhm, really get into what it was that she needed to get into. Uhm, it, I mean, it makes perfect sense in, in terms of, of Gloria wanting, you know, to have someone with the same, sort of, origins as, as her. So, and it would be interesting, you know, to, to sort of take it to the logical conclusion and then ask. You know, would you like me to help you find someone else where you're comfortable because I would assume that since she was honest enough and had, you know, the oomph to, to start the session that way that at the end, she would be honest enough to say, "It's not a match," or "Yeah, it's fine." 

00:42:45
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO And yet, it's possible that, that another therapist might have felt somewhat offended by her honesty. 

00:42:50
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ I would, yeah. I would, I would, I would imagine so. Yeah. But, you know, you, you don't personalize those kinds of things. It's an issue and you- (crosstalk) 

00:43:00
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:43:00
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ - have to deal with it but,- (crosstalk) 

00:43:00
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Certainly(ph). 

00:43:00
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ - uhm, and you take it from there. It's certainly, a-, any client who can do that, it's certainly to their credit. 

00:43:05
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. Okay. It's such an important distinction 'coz sometimes, we're, we're not that, uhm, well, I think we have expectations about clients' behaviors, don't we? Based on the impressions we have on them. They, you know, if they're Latinas and, you know, a lot of the stereotypes about Latinas may not fit than how someone presents in, in counseling like you did,- (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
GLORIA Uh hmm. 

00:43:30
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - being assertive about this. 

00:43:30
GLORIA Uh hmm. 

00:43:30
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO How is this issue of assertiveness for you in the workplace? 

00:43:35
GLORIA Well, it's, uhm, it's something that I had, ah, to learn to deal with, ah, very soon. Ah, the workplace, ah, in the United States is very different from, ah, what I'm used to at work or even in a family situation. You are not, ah, to, ah, you are not supposed to bring up issues so directly. Ah, you first try to do it, ah, some, by other means. I, I had to learn if I knew that, ah, if I wanted to succeed, I needed to be, ah, more direct and talk about my feelings more often and feel more secure about, about them. 

00:44:30
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

00:44:30
GLORIA And I, isn't, is-, it is not something that comes naturally but I, I drill myself and I do it every time I can. 

00:44:40
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Thank you. Dr. Man, ah, Gloria talked about her being different, her sense of being different and, and that, that there is some difference in terms of talking with an accent- (crosstalk) 

00:44:50
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:44:50
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - and looking different. Uhm, how do you, you see that in her work situation as a, as a counselor looking in on and hearing her story? How do you think those factors are in, in some way putting up a barrier between her and her boss? 

00:45:15
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ I think that in terms of the, of the work environment and her boss, I, I'm not, this is where I would feel it as a disadvantage is that, you know, I might be, I, in my head, I can, I can understand that and, uhm, but I can't, sort of, get a sense of especially how it would feel. But, certainly, if that's, you know, that's, that's how it feels for Gloria and you have to, you have to respect that, uhm, and certainly common sense dictates that, that probably, that's probably how it is and in my experience in the workplace is, has been, you know, that, uhm, you know, you have a pool of, of, uhm, Caucasian workers and Afro-American workers and Hispanics and there's sort of like, sort, the middle group kinda like the middle child. (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
GLORIA Uh hmm. 

00:46:10
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ There's sort of in between and not quite here and, and not quite there and I would, I would have to wonder about your, your bo-, the boss, your boss and if that's the base from which he would be operating to. 

00:46:25
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Thank you. And I think that's really the point we wanted to bring up. There are two points you've made Dr. Man that seemed very important to this. One is that sometimes for a therapist who is working with, ah, a, a client who's culturally different, and in this case, Latina, uhm, who'd, who's never had a, a difficulty communicating in English because you don't have an accent or you were born here and there's more cultural similarity than dissimilarity. 

00:46:50
GLORIA Uh hmm. 

00:46:50
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO  It might be hard to relate to that but you're saying you have to accept the client's- (crosstalk) 

00:46:55
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ  Yeah, yeah. 

00:47:00
GLORIA Yeah. 

00:47:00
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - experience and how she reports it. 

00:47:00
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:47:00
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO And second is that the environment in which one finds oneself working does in fact, contribute to feeling included and excluded and you come in about your sense of exclusion there. 

00:47:15
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:47:15
GLORIA Yes. Uhm, I feel extremely excluded, ah in, in the, the work setting. I feel that I don't have anyone to go to whenever I go and ask uhm, my, my fellow workers about the situation. They just don't feel to get it either. They just feel that everything is fine and, and that I shouldn't be worrying about this, ah, situation. And there is where I, you know, I, I start to doubt myself and feel that, that there's something that it's either wrong with me or the, the situation at work is not, is not the best for me. 

00:48:00
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Let's stop now because we want to go on to the learning points for this particular video. What Dr. Man raised for us a few minutes ago is the whole issue of how one's sense of belonging in an environment that's unfamiliar, ah, needs to be heard, ah, in its reality for the particular client that she's reporting it, even though as a, a counselor, we may never have experienced that sense of difference or, or disconnection. How the client presents that is very real to her. Ah, Gloria, the client, also raised for us some of the issues of, of feeling invisible, ah, in an environment that is different for, for her from a cultural ethnic and, and even a linguistic point of view. I'd like to just highlight a couple of other things that we really didn't have an adequate time to process. One is the issue of being bilingual and how being bilingual is really a strength but often in many work environments, ah, ah, an employee who speaks Spanish is, is ah, often faced with many work request and does comply but never receives any particular recognition or appreciation for that. A second point that I like to highlight is also the sense of loyalty that, ah, Latinos bring to, not only their families, but how that carries over to the workplace. And I heard Gloria having some conflict about that as well, again, doubting herself but also feeling that's though Hank(ph) was really giving her some good advice although we heard that she was starting to doubt that. I think the third issue that Dr. Man also brought up for us was that about the invisibility of Latinos in the workplace and perhaps how some managers, uhm, only look in terms of the reference as being white employees or black employees and, somehow, don't have enough information or enough understanding about how Latinos fit into this formula. 

00:50:10
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO  This is vignette number four. And it features Dr. Man with a mother and her teenage daughter. The participants in this. This is vignette number four. And it features Dr. Man with a mother and her teenage daughter. The participants in this role play are Mercedes the mother and Milagros the teenage daughter who you will hear who wants to be called Millie(ph). Let me tell you a little bit about this particular family. Mercedes has been a single mother for ten years raising her son, Jaime and her daughter Milagros. Mother and daughter have been engaged in many struggles recently about each other's wishes regarding Milagros' friends, her future education, she wants to go away to college, and their relationship to one another. Mercedes wants to raise her daughter like she was raised back in Puerto Rico. So let's hear the issues that come up from mother and daughter. Not only are they issues of family, their issues about acculturation, as well as the wish on each part, mother and daughter, to maintain a relationship, but in a different way. 

00:51:35
DR. LINDA MANJAREZ Hi, I'm Doctor Man. 

00:51:40
MERCEDES Very nice to meet you, I'm Mercedes.

00:52:10
MILLIE Uh hmm. 

00:52:10
MERCEDES Well, I don't think that's what brought us here, ah, or this could be something that we can talk about later on. Ah, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:52:15
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh-huh. 

00:52:15
MERCEDES - we have been having, ah, a lot of trouble lately- (crosstalk) 

00:52:20

MILLIE Uh hmm. 

00:52:30
MERCEDES - the family that she was brought up, ah, at, and she's getting too Americanized. And I'm not sure whether, ah, I can deal with that anymore. I have tried to talk to her about they, she, but she doesn't seem to li,- (crosstalk) 

00:52:45
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm.

MERCEDES - to be able to listen. 

00:52:50

00:52:55
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ But before that, is, ah, is it okay? I'd like to ask you and your mom a question? And, and I'm, I'm just wondering. Obviously, I'm not, ah, Latina counselor. 

00:53:05
MERCEDES Uh hmm. 

00:53:05
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uhm, I don't speak Spanish. I can read a dib here and there, but I'm wondering if you're, where you are with that. Uhm, well, I don't know quite exactly what you were expecting when you, when you, uhm, made the appointment. 

00:53:20
MERCEDES Well, I would have preferred definitely to have a Latina, or a Latino, ah,- (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ  Uh-huh. 

00:53:30
MERCEDES - it, ah, but it's very difficult to get one. Ah, I'm not sure whether this is going to work. Ah, just because I think that, ah, a Latino person would have been able to understand me better, and understand the family issues that are involved. Ah, I'm not sure, but I'm willing to try. 

00:53:50
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Okay. And, and. 

00:53:50
MILLIE I don't care. I mean, it was her idea to come here in the first place. So, I don't care if you're Latina or not. I don't care. It's no big deal to me. (crosstalk) 

00:53:55
MERCEDES Let's see. 

00:53:55
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ It doesn't, doesn't matter? 

00:53:55
MILLIE No. (crosstalk) 

00:53:55
MERCEDES  But. (crosstalk) 

00:54:00
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Okay. Oh, now, you're mom told me a little bit about what's going on in the family. Would you, what's, what, from your side, how does it look? 

00:54:10
MILLIE From my side? Yeah. Oh, you heard her. She just goes on and on. Uhm, she, she just goes on and on, I mean. (crosstalk) 

00:54:15
MERCEDES And the point is that there is no, no respect. No respect, no. (crosstalk) 

00:54:15
MILLIE (Laughs) 

00:54:15
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Okay, okay. Ah, let's just have one person at a time talking, okay. (crosstalk) 

00:54:20
MERCEDES Uh-huh. Fine. (crosstalk) 

00:54:20
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Now, can you just- (crosstalk) 

00:54:20
MILLIE Uh-huh. 

00:54:20
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Sort of give me a thumbnail sketch. 

00:54:25
MILLIE Okay. She says there's no respect in the house. But she gives me no respect either. 

00:54:25
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh-huh. 

00:54:25
MILLIE I mean, she says, "Oh, listen to me. Listen to me." She's always talking. She always says, "Listen to me." You know, but she has no respect what I have to say. She has no respect when, when I wanna talk. She doesn't listen to me either. I mean, she listens to Jaime all the time. 

00:54:40
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ And who's, who's, who's Jaime? 

00:54:40
MILLIE  Uhm, my brother. (crosstalk) 

00:54:45
MERCEDES Ah, he's my, my son. 

00:54:45
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Your son? And he's. (crosstalk) 

00:54:45
MERCEDES Ah, he's away, yeah, at college now. 

00:54:45
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ He's away. 

00:54:50
MERCEDES Yeah. 

00:54:50
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh-huh. What year is, is Jaime? 

00:54:50
MERCEDES He's in, in his freshman years. 

00:54:50
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ  He's a freshman. 

00:54:55
MERCEDES Yes. 

00:54:55
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ And you're a? 

00:54:55
MERCEDES But the problem is that she wants to go away too. (crosstalk) 

00:55:00
MILLIE Uh hmm. 

00:55:00
MERCEDES And I don't think that's acc, acceptable in our family. That would never happen. I'm, she should feel lucky that I want her to go to, to college. Ah, I think she should go to a community school around town- (crosstalk) 

00:55:15
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:55:15
MILLIE Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:55:15
MERCEDES - and do a two-year secretarial uhm,- 

00:55:20
MILLIE Look- (crosstalk) 

00:55:20
MERCEDES - course. 

00:55:20
MILLIE - look she's, okay, she wants me to go to, go to, go to secretarial school? (laughing) Please! (crosstalk) 

00:55:25
MERCEDES Yeah. I, I didn't went to college but I, I mean, I'd, I think that you should go but I don't want you out there, ah, I don't know what's out there- (crosstalk) 

00:55:35
MILLIE She thinks, I mean, I don't know, she'd- (crosstalk) 

00:55:35
MERCEDES - and what can happen to you. 

00:55:35
MILLIE - you're so. (crosstalk) 

00:55:35
MERCEDES I need, you need to be close to me- (crosstalk) 

00:55:40
MILLIE Ma, I'm almost 18 years old. (crosstalk) 

00:55:40
MERCEDES I need to protect you. I know, you're just 18. (crosstalk) 

00:55:45
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Okay, let me, let's hear Millie. Let's hear from Millie for a second. 

00:55:45
MILLIE Okay, first of all, I'm almost 18 years old. 

00:55:45
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Yes. 

00:55:45
MILLIE Yet, she still treats me like I'm five years old. 

00:55:50
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:55:50
MILLIE I mean, my brother can go away to school, okay, but I have to stay near the house, near home, etcetera, and she thinks that by, by leaving the house I'm abandoning my family? I'm not! I just wanna be able to, all my friends are doing it. 

00:56:05
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ All your friends are going away? 

00:56:05
MILLIE All my friends are going away to school. 

00:56:05
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ  Uh hmm. 

00:56:10
MILLIE And, uhm, I mean, I wanna be able to know how it is to live on my own. She did it. She came all the way from Puerto Rico on her own. 

00:56:15
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Oh, she did? 

00:56:15
MILLIE And, yeah. 

00:56:15
MERCEDES  Uh hmm. But those. (crosstalk) 

00:56:20
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ So, let me just see if I get this. Uhm, it's okay for Jaime to be wherever he is. Where is he, by the way? On the coast- (crosstalk) 

00:56:30
MILLIE Yeah. He always there. (crosstalk) 

00:56:30
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ - or somewhere? He's always in Amherst? 

00:56:30
MILLIE In Amherst. 

00:56:30
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Okay. So, he can be in Amherst, uhm, but if Millie wants to go away, that's either not okay or not acceptable or both? 

00:56:50
MERCEDES Jaime is a male. He was brought up to leave the house, to leave the home so, ah, soon enough in his life. 

00:56:55
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:56:55
MILLIE  He knows how to deal with, with problems. I raised him to be able to go out and deal with the problems. She's a female. She doesn't, I mean, she needs my protection. (crosstalk) 

00:57:10
MILLIE Ma. Okay. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:57:10
MERCEDES She needs to be close to me. And. (crosstalk) 

00:57:10
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Oh, it get, let me, I just, let me ask you a question that- (crosstalk) 

00:57:15
MERCEDES Uh-huh. 

00:57:15
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ - that, that uhm, Millie also asked you but I'm not quite sure what the answer was. Uhm, and it had something, didn't, didn't you make some sort of comment to Mom about that she came from Puerto Rico to here by herself? (crosstalk) 

00:57:25
MILLIE Yeah. She came here to the States. (crosstalk) 

00:57:30
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Is that, is that, is that. 

00:57:30
MERCEDES That is true, but those are very different circumstances. Ah, I had to come here to, to look for a job. And believe me, it wasn't easy. It was very- (crosstalk) 

00:57:40
MILLIE Mom. (crosstalk) 

00:57:40
MERCEDES - hard,- (crosstalk) 

00:57:40
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Yeah, I'm sure it was. (crosstalk) 

00:57:45
MERCEDES - very hard to get here by myself with two young children and have to deal with a completely different culture- (crosstalk) 

00:57:50
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:57:50
MERCEDES - and deal with so many new things that I wasn't used to. I don't want Milagros to go through this. I think- (crosstalk) 

00:58:00
MILLIE Mom. 

00:58:00
MERCEDES - that she needs to get, you know, she can go to school. If she can go to school close by she will be able to have whatever she wants but, I will be there. And I will be there-(crosstalk) 

00:58:10
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ I see- (crosstalk) 

00:58:10
MERCEDES - to, to help her and support her. (crosstalk) 

00:58:10
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ - you are worried if Millie goes away to school that her college experience is gonna be similar to when you came here from Puerto Rico? 

00:58:25
MERCEDES Yes! And there are so many differ ah, so many dangers out there, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:58:30
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh-huh. Can, can we just hear from Millie and what she thinks about that? 

00:58:30
MERCEDES Yeah, sure. 

00:58:30
MILLIE I mean, I don't think that she knows that she did a good job raising me. I mean, I know, I do respect her. I know she came here. She worked hard. She raised me and my brother, okay? (crosstalk) 

00:58:40
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

00:58:40
MILLIE And I know she, I know you did a lot, okay? But, there's more out there. And, I'm. 

00:58:45
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO  Let's now begin the debriefing of vignette number four. What we saw was not a very unusual situation as you would, within a Latino family. Ah, a mother and a daughter engaged in some struggles, because each wants to be connected but each also wants to be her own person, especially Milagros. I'd like to talk to the participants about the role that they played but also about the issues that they saw from their respective roles. Ah, Dr. Man, could you begin by telling us what you saw as the issues, ah, a non-Latino counselor might have missed with respect to Mercedes' wish to really have her daughter be there with her? 

00:59:35
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Yeah, uhm, that, that a non-Latino counselor would have missed. Which is just what you were saying in terms of sort of wanting, you know, wanting to maintain the togetherness but still allowing some growth. Sort of go but don't go, kind of, kind of, kind of a tug-of-war, which is, you know, sort of different from, actually it's quite different from what I learned and what I was, the way I was trained in terms of, you know, separation is to be all and end all. (crosstalk) 

01:00:15
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

01:00:15
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ And, you just gotta do it, and bite the bullet, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So, uhm. 

01:00:20
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO The rule about self determination is very strong in our, in our counseling models. 

01:00:25
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Yeah, yeah. Definitely, and, and, yeah, it would be easy to fall into that with, with, with mom and with, with daughter. 

01:00:35
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:00:35
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ That's not the model that they're coming from, and it's not the model that they're both struggling with. 

01:00:40
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO  Ah, one of the things that we, ah, of course, didn't allow with the time was to have a, a fuller discussion and just to make an observation, ah, Mercedes, in a way ah, Dr Man stepped into one pitfall though,- (crosstalk) 

01:01:00
MERCEDES Yeah. 

01:01:00
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - which was about giving more time, or giving equal time or she said she was gonna give equal time to Millie. How did you take that? 

01:01:05
MERCEDES Oh, it was hard, very difficult, uhm. 

01:01:10
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Did you offensive? 

01:01:10
MERCEDES  It's, yes. It, it, it is offensive. I think that, uhm, the way, ah, Latinos ah, bring up their children is that they are supposed to look up to their parents. And, one way of manifesting that is to, perhaps, not talk until they are uhm, they feel that they can talk, and that is ah, not, is not ah, a difficult thing to, to learn in, in, in a Latino family. You are, you make sure as a kid that you don't talk until your parents allow you, or that you feel that they have finished ah, their thoughts. And, here I am, ah, in the presence of a, of a person that is giving my daughter equal time, and that is not acceptable. 

01:02:05
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Uh hmm. 

01:02:05
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO So, in a way, it's a breach of, of what we call ah, "respeto." 

01:02:10
MERCEDES Right. It's ah. (crosstalk) 

01:02:10
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO And respect is, again, very defined in Latino culture based on your role and hierarchy as well,- (crosstalk) 

01:02:20
MERCEDES Uh hmm. 

01:02:20
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - and ah, in this case, in the family. Ah, Milagros, you talked about the, uhm, the wish to be your own person,- (crosstalk) 

01:02:25
MILLIE Uh hmm. 

01:02:25
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - and, and yet your mother is wanting you to stay at home, not go to college, ah, away from home, and- 

01:02:35
MILLIE Uh hmm. 

01:02:35
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - ah, can you talk about your bi-cultural experiences? (crosstalk) 

01:02:40
MILLIE I think, I think one of the hardest things that I was trying to express in the fact, was that, you're kinda caught in the middle ah, you know, of, I do respect the Latino culture, I do respect being close to your family, I try to stress that. I wasn't gonna abandon my family, but the same time, I, she doesn't understand that in the United States, you know, you expect to go to college, and that's really important. So, it was very difficult for me to express to her how, I guess how, uhm, I guess, the American culture, what their expectations, at my high school are. That, you know, you do go away to college, you know. You don't stay at home. And people who stay at home weren't, you know, you're not achieving. 

01:03:15
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. So, there are different norms that you have at school and norms- (crosstalk) 

01:03:20
MILLIE Uh hmm. 

01:03:20
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - at home, of course, from the culture, very strong messages. We also heard the double standards about how you're raising your son and, we would call them double standard, and then, how you want ah, Millie to be, or Milagros do these double standards typically operate in, in Latino families? 

01:03:40
MERCEDES Ah, I think they do. In a way, it's changing, but I think that ah, up to now, it's the male, ah, it's the son that goes out, and, and, and gets ah, the college education, ah, for many reasons prac, basically because ah, the, it, it is the male who is supposed to be the only ah, provider of the, of the, economic provider of the house. And the female is supposed to stay home uhm, raising the children. So, it's not like uhm, the, the woman is supposed to go out and, and get a college education. She is supposed to stay close to home, do, perhaps, some college, because she would have, ah, a better opportunities to get, perhaps, a job. Well, she is not married, or maybe to help support the family later on but nothing serious as a son or the male, ah, son will have to, uhm. 

01:04:50
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO  So, the expectation would be, that she would stay at home, until. 

01:04:55
MILLIE I think it's the ah, I think it's really important, I think, for the Latina woman to be the mother, to be a family, sort of very priority,- (crosstalk) 

01:05:00
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

01:05:00
MILLIE - you know, they look upon you just like, you don't wanna have a family, that should be your first priority. (crosstalk) 

01:05:05
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Uh hmm. 

01:05:05
MILLIE You know, a career woman isn't something that seen upon favorably. 

01:05:10
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO It's not valued in the culture. 

01:05:10
MILLIE  Yeah. 

01:05:15
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO The, the role of mother is highly valued- (crosstalk) 

01:05:15
MILLIE Yeah. 

01:05:15
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO - in Latino culture. Doctor Man, are there any cultural issues that, uhm, you were wondering about, and ah, were not so sure of as we had this ah, role-play, go on, anything that you were curious and didn't have a chance to explore? 

01:05:35
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Well, the, again, you know, the whole, uhm, the, you know, the difference in how separation is viewed in, in, uhm, as desirable or undesirable, or, however, you wanna frame it, and who, who has, what expectations surround it. Uhm, but, but then I had, I had another question too, in terms of like the value of motherhood, and motherhood is, you know, uhm, very, it's sort of, like,- (crosstalk) 

01:06:05
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Very sacred. Very sacred. (crosstalk) 

01:06:05
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Thank you. Yeah, very sacred. So then, if, uhm, the daughter goes off to college, what happens to the mom's role and does that mean, a, a lost of respect, a lost of position, uhm. (crosstalk) 

01:06:25
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO It might be a lost of esteem. 

01:06:25
DR. LINDA MANJARREZ Yeah. (crosstalk) 

01:06:25
DR. PATRICIA ARREDONDO Certainly, it might be in a lost of esteem. What you're raising are some very important questions and observations, and, if this ah, relationship, counseling relationship were to continue, these would be some of the issues that would be raised and discussed, perhaps, separately with mom, not in front of daughter either, because that becomes more personal. Ah, and then, you would also want to see how daughter could understand what that would mean to mom if, if she were to go off to school, she, if you gave her permission to go, go off to school. Let's make sure we understand some of the, ah, main points, learning points for this particular vignette. One is that, in Latino culture, daughters are an extension of their mothers. Ah, we talked in some of the earlier role plays about how women are socialized to be, not only caretakers, but how daughters are expected to be their mother's right hand person. We also heard the double binds that present for ah, both, both the mother and the daughter. Certainly, the double binds for the daughter about bringing up, ah, being raised, rather, in a bi-cultural environment. And, that there is greater protection of young women in Latino culture, the norms are different for men and women. Acculturation impacts families of different generations and we heard the acculturation differences between mother and daughter. Clearly, the emphasis on the Anglicized name that Millie wanted to have is a point that, ah, I think, many of us can relate to, if we have been counseling in by bilingual, bicultural situations, and I think the last point that Dr. Man underscored a couple of times is this issue of separation versus individuation. Uhm, one that, in Latino culture, really does not have any standing. In fact, it's very counter-cultural, uhm, to want to move away. And again, that does not, in any way, suggest enmeshment, as it has often been characterized, but more, it's a statement about the value of interdependence, as well as loyalty to the family. The four vignette you saw in this videotape are just a few examples of a number of issues that might arise in counseling with Latinos. The main issues we covered in these four vignettes were relationships, issues of authority, the family, came out very strongly, and gender roles. We also heard through these, the sense of commitment and loyalty individuals have to their families. From the role of the therapist, we heard some of the issues that they could more easily relate to because they were of the same culture, other issues that one could relate to because of good counseling skills, being good active listeners, being very perceptive about the dynamics that were going on between mother and daughter and between the couple, Sophie and Raul. But at the same time as, as Dr. Man pointed out, there were some issues that, because of our counseling upbringing, if you would, or, or the cult, culture of counseling that might be different and new to a counselor who is not culturally aware of Latino values. So, I hope you have found this tape to be useful to your own learning experience, that you will make a real commitment to learn as much as you can about counseling with Latinos. This tape is just one tool for that, and we hope to hear from you about other ideas you may have for tapes that might be useful to your continued education and development. Thank you for being with us. Y buenas noches.
