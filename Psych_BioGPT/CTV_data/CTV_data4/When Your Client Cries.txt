RICH SIMON Morning, everyone. Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker. Welcome to this webcast series on the emotion revolution about how to engage with clients and how to bring emotion in a positive way. How to, how to use emotion in the therapeutic enterprise in the most productive way. It's, uh, we don't have any choice. We're, we're, uh, as our, our guest today will be explaining to us , we're always in a emotional state of one kind or another, but extreme emotional states, uh, have a way of freezing many of us. Therapists as well as civilians, and so we're gonna be taking a look today at, uh, some of the extreme expressions of emotion and really understanding the, more deeply, the very nature of emotion. Um, and some of our misconceptions about emotion. Uh, time hallowed though they may be. My great pleasure to introduce, uh, my, my mentor, my, uh, professor from my undergraduate years who has become a very good friend and a frequent contributed to Psychotherapy Networker and, and presenter at the Networker Symposium, Jay Efran. Jay, how are ya? 

00:01:20
JAY EFRAN Good, how are you? 

00:01:25
RICH SIMON So, Jay, the, the whole word is talking about your article, "Why We Cry," which, uh, wh-, which was published in our last issue on emotion and got picked up on the internet, and you gotten a lot, I know, a lot of response to it. And here's, here's this topic, here's this human experience that is, from the, our earliest origins we've been crying about one thing or another as well as having other extremes of emotion, and, at the same time, it's still so poorly understood. What is it about the nature of emotions and emotional experience, and, particularly, more extreme emotions, more demonstrative emotions, that makes it hard for therapists and everybody else to understand them? 

00:02:10
JAY EFRAN Well, you know, one of the amazing things is that even though tears and laughter and, uh, tantrums and so on are so central and so important in our experience, there's been precious little research about it. Not only that, in, in graduate school programs, at least the ones I know about, there's almost no training in it. So, the topic goes completely undiscussed, and I'm afraid that many therapists, uh, come out of their training programs with exactly the same view of emotions with which they went in. Which is to say a kind of primitive, what is sometimes called a steam kettle approach, uh, namely that emotions, if they're c-, if they're held inside, will cause all kinds of trouble, will reek havoc, and they must either be expressed, uh, or you must find some way to deal with them. So, a-, a-, and we have all these expressions in our culture about, uh, emotions boiling over, rage, uh, boiling over, uh, uh, um, I don't know what some of the others are, um, but just a whole host im-, that imply the steam kettle model as if we have things contained inside that are pressing for release, and, unless they're released and under the right circumstances or in the right ways, uh, they will cause difficulty. So, that's the sort of primitive notion, it goes way back, to, uh, the days when we, uh, gave people, uh, purgatives to rid the body of toxins, retrefent (ph) skulls to release the e-, evil sports, we did bloodletting, uh, to get rid of, uh, the nasty stuff. And our theories of emotion still have that crude quality. So, I think it's time we sort of updated ourselves in these areas. 

00:04:05
RICH SIMON Alright, so let's, uh, let's come at this topic, uh, with, uh, putting aside some of these, uh, misconceptions. So, describe for us, what is, how would you describe what we refer to, this poorly under-, under, uh, stood dimension of human experience called emotion. How would you define? What i-, what is emotion after all? 

00:04:25
JAY EFRAN By the way, uh, in working on the article, uh, we looked through books for therapists and looked for definitions of emotion, and, basically, there were none. Basically, everybody seemed to take fore granted that everybody knows what an emotion is. And they just, uh, don't bother to give any formal definition. And I think that's a, it gets in our way. So, uh, taking my cue from, uh, from, a biologists and cyberneticist, Maggirana (ph), Humberto Maggirana (ph) in Chile, uh, I think of emotion as the hormonal and posturally, posture, uh, supports, the musculoskeletal and hormonal supports that, uh, make, uh, classes of action possible. And each class of actions would have its own, uh, calibrations. So, for example, if you wanna go to sleep, you have to have a certain level of adrenaline and a certain muscular tension, or, rather, lack of tension, otherwise you're not gonna be able to fall asleep. Those settings are completely, uh, wrong if what you're gonna do is fight. And that's gonna be, uh, i-, that's gonna get in your way if what you wanna do is, uh, be, uh, affiliative and loving. So, um, what these supports do in their hormonal and their, and their postural, is make certain classes of action more probable, less probable. Um, so, one of the examples, uh, that I've used in the past in trying to describe this is, you had a fight at the office, you're still, uh, rehearsing what you might have said, what you could have said, what you shouldn't have said, and you ring the doorbell of your house and your wife is standing there, and she wants a kiss. And you cannot do this. Because you're still in the hormonal calibrations for fighting, and not for affiliating. 

00:06:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:06:35
JAY EFRAN So, you say, uh, eh, I, "Not now, I'm not in the mood." Uh, or you, the best you can do is a little peck and, uh, because you need time, the, the body chemistry needs time to make the shift from one set to the other set. One set of calibrations to the other set of calibrations. 

00:07:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:07:00
JAY EFRAN So, again, these support or interfere with particular classes of activity. Now, I think the thing that will come, in this definition, that will come as a surprise to therapists is I'm not saying that, uh, emotions are just those dramatic, uh, instances when we want, uh, um, uh, assassinate somebody, or when we want to, um, when we're feeling a great grief and so on. Or- 

00:07:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Highly aroused states of emotion. 

00:07:30
JAY EFRAN Yeah. Uh, all activities, uh, require emotional settings, it's, we want to get rid of the, uh, notion that, uh, George Kelly said years ago, "Confuse everything and clarify nothing of dividing ourselves up into s-, thoughts, feelings, and, and passions." And then trying to figure out do thoughts cause feelings? Do feelings cause actions? Do thoughts cause actions? Do actions cause feelings? Um, and of course, people have been all around the block on that, and they're not gonna be able to resolve it, because we are one entity. We are not separate thoughts, feelings, and actions. Um, now, there are, uh, emotional contradictions, such as the one where you arrive at the doorstep and, but you're, a-, a-, and you're not ready for affiliation, you're still doing, uh, fighting. Another intere-, so one of the things Maggirana (ph) says, which I found very helpful, is that understanding is an emotion. Uh, logical, rational work is an emotion. In other words, if you're too aroused, you can't think straight. And, if you are not aroused enough, uh, you're ready for sleep, uh, you're not gonna engage in, in active problem solving. So, even something that we usually think of as thinking rather than feeling, is in itself a commentary on a very particular set of emotional settings. 

00:08:55
RICH SIMON Okay. Alright, so, th-, that's, um, and the e-, the, another thing that's happened within the larger shift of thought in the field, is there are people like Alan Shore, who, has helped us name this webcast series, he talks about the emotional revolution. So one of the things we are, we have been through most of our history is I feel very language bound, and we've really privileged aspects of human experience that are neatly described in language and have a more, a linear, can we represent for ourselves in a more linear form, and over this last stretch, part of what you're saying has come out from the, the fringe, this perspective you're offering has become increasingly something that's integrated with our understanding of how we function, how the brain operates, and our increasing ability to, uh, investigate the non-verbal, the intuitive, the, the, uh, and our, these di-, our, our different body states and how they are related to our relationships and everything else that's part of human (inaudible ) 

00:10:10
JAY EFRAN Yeah. Yeah, well I don't, I don't think we want to subscribe to what's been called the, uh, the myth of irrational, uh, irrational, uh, uh, uh, um, missing the last word, superiority. Uh, where we, we romantically assume that because a person is in a state of, of emergency or crisis or strong reactivity that this, uh, is the only place where wisdom comes from or where intuitive wisdom comes from. I think we've gotten a little bit overly romantic. So, neither the myth of rational supremacy nor the myth of irrational supremacy, uh, tells the full story. 

00:10:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. Okay, I mean, that, that, so, let, let's, so, in, in the piece you, since we've, uh, given where we are, uh, at, at the moment here, bringing in the brain, neurophysiology and our ability as a, as a field now to bring in, we've opened up the brack, black box, we understand more how the human nervous system operates then, then we did, uh, 20 or 30 years ago. Uh, talk to us about, so why do we cry? Tell us about your, uh, the, the, the main thesis of your piece and why it's important. 

00:11:30
JAY EFRAN Yeah. Uh, so, we're proposing a two-stage theory of tears. And the tears only occur in th-, in stage two. You need stage one to be able to have tears, but the tears themselves do not emerge until stage two. In stage one there is autonomic system arousal. Sympathetic system arousal. The person becomes, for various reasons, and we, we can get into these, tense, and they are on high alert. They're scanning the environment, they sense themselves to be having a problem on their hands. Then, something happens, and in our research we, uh, found that people can pretty much put their finger on the psychological trigger that allows stage one to move toward stage two. And stage two is a recovery phase. Eh, instead of tension arousal, it's tension reduction and recovery. It's, uh, it's, it's rebalancing the system calibrations. So, let me give you a s-, just a simple example. 

00:12:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:12:40
JAY EFRAN You had a child who's, uh, in a supermarket, and has lost, temporarily lost, his mother. She is nowheres to be found. So, the child becomes aroused. Now, during this arousal phase, there's search, there's, uh, intense, uh, th-, focus, but no tears. Then, the mother's face appears around the aisle, and the problem is, essentially, solved, and the child's system goes off duty. And there's a release, or a l-, relief, or a switch into, uh, the second stage, the recovery stage, and tears are the outward manifestation that that stage has begun to take place. By the way, the parents, then, say to the child, "Why are you crying, I'm here now?" 

00:13:35
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:13:40
JAY EFRAN Uh, and, and sometimes worse than that, what, I'll give you something to cry about. But it's the parents that are wrong here. The child's physiology is doing exactly the right thing. Intense problem solving in stage one with arousal, and then a switch to a rapid recovery stage two accompanied by outward tears. Uh, so, that's the basic mechanism. Notice, by the way, that the tears are not sad, they're not happy, they're simply an outward manifestation of a shift in body chemistry. Whether we call the tears "tears of joy" or "tears of sadness" has to do with the situation, not with the tears themselves. It's the same tears, whether we call it happy, or sad, or anything else. Um, and, but these tears, as Ian Fry, the researcher in, in tears, one of the few that's do-, actually done some of the hard work in this area, uh, points out, those tears which we might consider emotional tears, um, have a different composition than, uh, the tears that, that wash your eye when you have something in it, or the searing pa-, the, the tears that accompany searing pain. And Fry thinks some of the form-, there's actual hormonal discharges in these tears. Uh, that's not quite clear as yet. 

00:15:05
RICH SIMON Okay. So, and, and they, the, the, the, the term you use, en, to describe this two stage is the shift from the, the dominance of the sympathetic nervous system, that is the part of the nervous system- 

00:15:20
JAY EFRAN (crosstalk)Sure, right. 

00:15:20
RICH SIMON Ready for action. To the parasympathetic nervous system. 

00:15:20
JAY EFRAN (crosstalk)To the parasympathetic. Right. Right. And this has, again, just been substantiated recently by a study, I think in Denmark, I might be wrong about the country, where, uh, where heart, where they've measured heart rate and other physiological indicators, and they pick up an indication of the change in these factors as we shift into what, what I'm calling stage two. 

00:15:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:15:45
JAY EFRAN Now, when I've mentioned this to people, they say, "But, uh, yeah, but I'm seeing children cry when their mother is still missing." And that's true. Depending on the child's age and sophistication and background, some children will cry before their mother appears simply because A, let's say the storekeeper or the clerk, uh, uh, is sympathetic and says, "What's wrong?" And the, uh, uh, and agrees to help. And, and ano-, a, a, a sympathetic adult may be sufficient. Um, if enough resources have been lost, in other words, if the child has gone through its entire repertoire of problem solving resources, they may, like an infant, cry and, essentially, give up, let go, and you, again, will have a recovery period, even though the problem itself has not yet been solved. And, during that recovery period, it's as if the system is preparing for another assault on the problem. Uh, it, in, particularly in the younger years, this crying of, uh, I had no resources left is also a signal to caretakers, so this has an evolutionary significance, because in the, what biologists call the average expectable environment, there's usually someone around to help the child, and so this is a signal that, "I don't, I don't have anymore resources, please help me with this circumstance." And the adult picks up the infant, if it's an infant, and, and is soothing, or shows the child how to put the block in the right hole, that is makes, makes the problem easier, uh, so, i-, in all those cases, though, uh, there is this shift, and there either a letting go, uh, temporarily giving up, having the solution, uh, and, and being able to go off duty, relax, and so on. 

00:17:55
RICH SIMON Okay. Cuz one of the, eh, the, um, the responses, I think, that, that I heard when I've talked about your article a-, and also that you heard from me when you were writing the article for the magazine was we wanna poke holes in this. It couldn't be this, you couldn't cover the entire range of human emotional response with a two stage theory, here. So let me just track this, cuz every, cuz people, inevitably, well, what about, and there's the circumstance. So what you're saying here- 

00:18:25
JAY EFRAN (crosstalk)Yep. 

00:18:25
RICH SIMON -is, um, for, in some cases there's a stand in for the parent or even, uh, that there's a, a, the person who's having this shift from, um, being mobilized and aroused to, uh, shifting into another mode of activity, perceives some sort of safety or comfort in the environment, whether it's, it's, uh, uh, w-, whether it's, it's an obvious one or not, and that's part of what the trigger is. And then there's another case that you've just mentioned, and I, I don't think you highlighted so much in your piece, about sometimes we cry where you just kind of, uh, eh, there's a kind of tears that's just a losing it tears, that's analogous to a, a, an infant who, uh, has just run out of, uh, ways of, of coping, and is just letting go with emotion. Is, is, do I have that one right? 

00:19:15
JAY EFRAN Yeah, yeah. And, you know, we could almost, um, uh, uh, form a continuum here. So, very young, very young kids and infants are easily overwhelmed and they have very little, uh, um, they cry easily. And this calls in somebody to attend to them. As we get older, uh, we, we cry less easily, it's, and we, in order to sh-, make that shift we have to feel that we're in a safe or sympathetic environment to some degree. More rarely with adults is the case that we simply have, uh, nothing left within us that we have to just, uh, collapse and back off and recuperate. Uh, and, of course, the continuum includes, uh, the difference betwee-, still difference in our culture, disappearing a bit, between men and women, where men are going to be the least ready to make that switch into the parasympathetic, and women are much more able to. 

00:20:30
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:20:30
JAY EFRAN So, and, and, probably derived from the fact that the men were the warriors, and letting go in this way is a sort of sign of weakness. You don't wanna be on the battlefield and be crying your eyes out. You wanna wait til your back in sympathetic surroundings. 

00:20:45
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:20:50
JAY EFRAN But the principle applies, uh, to all of us, that is, the more sympathetic, friendly, uh, situation the more able we are to move, to move effectively from stage one to stage two. In the article I mentioned, uh, the situation where, where my father had died and I was out of town, I was in New Jersey, and I had a long bus ride home. And I was completely dry-eyed during this entire trip. But once I saw that's, my mother come to the door of our house, the tears gushed out, because that meant to me safety, home, give up, you can give up, it's safe, we'll be all right, somebody else is gonna help, that whole sympathetic reception. 

00:21:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:21:40
JAY EFRAN Uh, I guess we should also say, men in movie theaters sometimes have a tough time of it because they've been moved to tears, sometimes by the silliest of movies, that is, uh, the tear jerkers that sometimes, uh, sometimes get to us, and by playing with the t-, kind of trigger that moves from, uh, stage one to stage two- 

00:22:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:22:00
JAY EFRAN Uh, the fact that this, that it's in, that the, that this is not a heavy drama, it's a rather, uh, inane, uh, manipulative, uh, film, so men are now finding themselves, uh, weeping or ready to weep, and the lights in the theater are coming up. And they don't w-, like to be seems as what they construe as weak. 

00:22:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:22:25
JAY EFRAN Which, by the way, we don't construe as weak. So, what do they do? They reintroduce tension as best they're able to, which is where our expression, I suppose, "a stiff upper lip" comes from. 

00:22:40
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:22:40
JAY EFRAN They hold themselves tight. 

00:22:40
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:22:40
JAY EFRAN And try to change the subject and think about something else as quickly as possible. 

00:22:45
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:22:45
JAY EFRAN So, that, again, i-, uh, illustrates those, that same mechanism in a somewhat different setting. 

00:22:55
RICH SIMON So, uh, the, a-, and we're gonna get, in a moment we're gonna in, in the, in the piece there, um, you talk about some dos and don'ts and you i-, look at the pragmatics of helping clients, uh, facilitating emotion in the consulting room. Um, and, and we'll get to that in a moment. S-, there's one area i-, in terms of the, some of these distinctions that I, are, I think are helpful, is, and this is, uh, I think w-, on ultranet, which is, uh, a aggregate site where you had, uh, a, um, i-, which is a j-, progressive, um, aggregator of, mainly, political items, and they like to pick up networker items, uh, you know, they know who th-, most, for the most part who therapists are, and they, uh, picked up your article, there were a lot of responses to it, a-, and one of the areas here that w-, let's work on this a little bit, in terms of distinctions, is this whole matter of when people have been traumatized, and traumatic response. And how does that, your talking in, for the most part, you're talking about a kind of a natural cycle as we move from the, the, uh, sympathetic to the parasympathetic, from, uh, arousing situations to recover to safety, there's a, there's this kind of natural physiological release, perhaps the tears are a way of clearing out hormones, or, who knows, you could speculate on the function the actual tears have, but, uh, let's distinguish between the trauma response, where people get stuck in reliving some horrible experience and what you're describing. What, what's the, what's the application of this two-stage theory to people who have been traumatized by some overwhelming emotional experience, uh, negative emotional experience. 

00:24:45
JAY EFRAN Uh, in cases of trauma, and also in cases of, uh, depression, one of the things we notice is people have difficulty crying. And, uh, they don't, uh, the, the way Harvey Jackins, the founder of re-evaluation counseling who, uh, sort of developed a c-, a technology of working with people so that they would cry, one of the things he noticed is that, that people in these situations do not have enough sense of safety to be able to make that switch into stage two. Remember, this in-, this increases vulnerability. In stage two, you are relaxing and allowing other people around you to be of service. Both that's the true with, with the infant and with the adult. And a person who's experienced something where the fear is so, um, ripe, has difficulty letting that tens-, letting that tension go and being able to make the shift that lasts. So, some of the work with trauma individuals is to allow that safety, uh, environment to be built so that the processing conti-, uh, of the traumatic even can continue. 

00:26:05
RICH SIMON And there's the other, uh, and perhaps this is, this applies to that earlier distinction we were talking about, because there are depressions and, and people who are, uh, who have been traumatized who cannot stop crying. It's another way of a, of a, a, uh, another kind of trauma response, but, perhaps, that's more analogous to what you were saying earlier where you've exhausted your resources. 

00:26:25
JAY EFRAN Yeah. 

00:26:25
RICH SIMON And you have no oth-, you just, you're not in a problem solving mode, you just don't know, there's no o-, there's nothing else available to you to respond, no other way. 

00:26:35
JAY EFRAN But there's another situation in which people seem to go on crying for a long time, and, uh, just a couple of minutes of crying, sometimes, to an anxious bystander or to a therapist if the therapist is anxious about such, uh, outward manifestations of their, of their reaction, um, uh, what happens is they become tense all over again, and embarrassed about the tears. And they'll say, "Oh, I sh-, I shouldn't have done, I didn't mean to do this, and so on and so one." Well, that increases tension, which means that the recovery period is interrupted, and we're back in a bit of stage one and, therefore, making oneself ripe for another stage two. So, you get a cycle of tension, tension reduction, tension, tension reduction, and you get this periodic crying which appears to the, to the observer to go on for long, you know, long periods of time. 

00:27:35
RICH SIMON Okay, alright. 

00:27:35
JAY EFRAN It's something that therapists need to be alert to. 

00:27:40
RICH SIMON And that's the, eh, so let's get into the, the pragmatics of y-, this way of thinking about tears and their, the, the function that tears have in, in our lives. So, it, you take a, much of the piece, your talking about dos and dont's in the consulting room in regard to tears. 

00:28:00
JAY EFRAN Yeah. 

00:28:00
RICH SIMON Um, so, to begin with, so, so what, what's important here, what is it that you want therapists to understand about this two stage model, and l-, then let's go on and t-, talk to us about what you consider to be the dos and don'ts of responding to a client who is crying. 

00:28:15
JAY EFRAN Uh, um, before we get to that, Rich, uh, I just wanted to add, uh, therapists sometimes have difficulty, it's not only in responding to crying but also to laughter and giggling. Uh, uh, because they think, "Well, this is serious, why aren't you doing work?" But, just like, uh, tears, laughter and giggling indicate stage two and are productive to the session. They don't mean the person that's taking it lightly. I mean, they are going through this, this arousal which then allows this period of recovery. Um, so I think therapists need to be aware of that. 

00:29:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:29:00
JAY EFRAN When we go into tears, um, because we, because of evolution, and the fact that when we t-, dealing with infants, most of us are made uncomfortable and we feel we have to rush in and do something. And what, therefore, therapists do is too much. Because while, maybe with an infant there's something active you need to do, with an adult there isn't much you need to do. So, most of the dos and don'ts fall under what not to do. And, uh, so, uh, let me a give a couple of example of things not to do. First of all, you don't crowd the person. You don't come over and do lots of patting and, "there, there, there" and, because if you've cried recently yourself you know you really need some space around you. The environment needs to be safe, uh, but you, you don't want people hovering you, and you don't want them answering a lot of questions about wha-, what's it, what is it, what's gone wrong, what, nothing is wrong, this is a natural process, and, uh, it seems to be best let it continue, uh, th-, through its endpoint. There's plenty of time for interrogation later. You can, later you can say, uh, "What helped you cry?" But that's, you say that afterward, not during the tears. During the tears you do nothing. If you're close enough, and you have the right kind of relationship, you might just reach out and touch the person's arm lightly to, to let them know that you're there. You might, if the tissue box is positioned correctly, hand them a tissue. Although I once got myself into some trouble with that because I handed this woman a tissue and she said, "Oh, I don't need that." And it broke up the entire mood, cuz I was too quick. Um but we don't want to, this is not a time for interpretations, uh, and we don't want to treat the tears as if they are the problem. The tears are never the problem. The tears, in fact, are a good outward sign that p-, that active processing is happening. So, one of our, uh, uh, eh, axioms is, "If tears are flowing, do nothing." However, if you are tense, that will tend to inhibit the tears. Remember, we don't cry unless its safe, and part of the safety is not making the other person uncomfortable. So, Harvey Jackins used to say that some of the male therapists couldn't understand why their cri-, why their clients weren't crying. And the answer was, the male therapists were uncomfortable with tears. 

00:31:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:32:00
JAY EFRAN And, uh, I've learned, over the years, just to sit back, it's, in fact it's a compliment that the person is willing to cry in your presence. It means they regard you as a safety mode, uh, and, uh, and not as an enemy, and the they are going to be willing to let you be a part of this. So, it's a great compliment, and you allow the person to enjoy being with you in this way. Uh- 

00:32:25
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. 

00:32:25
JAY EFRAN I mentioned that we say, sometimes, afterward, "What is the thought that helped you cry?" 

00:32:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:32:35
JAY EFRAN I do not say, "What made you cry," because I don't like the idea that one person controls another person's feelings. So, what is it in connection with your crying? Not, "What made you cry?" And I don't w-, I don't like the causal ec-, the c-, the hard causality of, "What made you?" And it also implies that something, uh, disagreeable or bad to say, "What made you do it?" So I say, uh, uh, "What helped you cry?" Which, which is a pota-, positive connotation. And, from Jackins, long ago I learned that, uh, it's much more productive to say, "What is the thought that helped you cry?" Not what is, "What are you feeling?" If you say, "What are you feeling?" you too often get a very unhelpful report of physiological, uh, readings, you know? "Oh, my, well, I'm feeling this in my stomach and I'm," you know? That's not what we want, we want the image, the thought, the movie, and we particularly want to know what is the thought or image that allowed the transition from stage one to stage two, because that's psychologically meaningful. 

00:34:00
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:34:00
JAY EFRAN So, let me stop there for a minute. 

00:34:05
RICH SIMON Okay. So, the, the, really, so, if, if we have what you're challenging are unconsidered assumptions tears have, necessarily has something to do with sadness, that there's something bad about tears or that the therapists have to, uh, provide some kind of psychological band aid, and, in fact, what you're saying if there's a, and there are context effects all, but, essentially, tears are self regulating. 

00:34:35
JAY EFRAN Yeah. 

00:34:35
RICH SIMON That the very fact of tears, that someone's moving from a state of arousal to a state of, uh, feeling more balanced, of, uh, going off duty as you, is the phrase that you u-, like to use, and that, that basically the tears are, that, are a therapeutic ally, and, and are providing something, typically, uh, that's a lot more potent than anything that we might do at that moment. 

00:35:00
JAY EFRAN Yeah, they mean that you're in exactly the right spot with the client. 

00:35:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:35:05
JAY EFRAN And you don't wanna do anything, you don't wanna, you don't wanna move on, you don't wanna be in a hurry. By the way, everybody always stops crying, nobody ever just continues crying for the rest of their life, it's not an emergency. 

00:35:20
RICH SIMON Right, yeah. 

00:35:25
JAY EFRAN Um, so, you wanna really relax and, and, uh, something useful has just happened. 

00:35:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah. So, it's a discovery of a, a very intuitive, natural, typically sponta-, of a, of a resource, of a positive experience for the client, and it's, if you look at it that way, you're gonna respond in a very different way than you think that you have to fix something. 

00:35:50
JAY EFRAN Yeah. And notice, by the way we talk about, uh, having had a good cry. Because people often feel better after, uh, they have engaged in, in stage two. What we're calling stage two. Now, it's not the tears, you know, there ha-, there have been therapists in the catharsis, uh, uh, uh, that have operated in terms of catharsis who've gone so far as to wanting to measure how many tissues the client has used, as if the tears themselves are valuable. No, the tears are an outward manifestation of a valuable process, and the fact that that process is moving forwards satisfactorily. So it's not tears that, that make it a good cry, it's, it's the system restoration that makes it a good cry. 

00:36:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:36:40
JAY EFRAN Your system is back in balance, and you feel, "I have, uh, handled something, something. I have moved, uh, uh, moved along a path. I have, um, I'm ready for whatever comes next." 

00:36:55
RICH SIMON Okay. Now, you men-, from a moment ago, uh, you, you mentioned, uh, Jackins, Harvey Jackins, a guy, if not a household word in our field. Having known you forever I remember back when I first met you when we were both at the University of Rochester, I, I think it was pretty soon after, uh, Jackins, this was late 60s. 

00:37:15
JAY EFRAN Yes. 

00:37:15
RICH SIMON Uh, had made, uh, his appearance there. And so, he had some intriguing ideas here about, um, about tears and, uh, technology of, about, in regard to emotion. He, some of his assumptions you share, and, and some, uh, and many you don't, but you were interested in this technology. Talk to us about, what was this technology, and why did you, why do you think it's, uh, was useful to you? And what's the, and what its implications might be for us. 

00:37:45
JAY EFRAN Well, Jackins, um, uh, I don't know if you, uh, if people know that reevaluation counseling, um, the way they set it up is that people counsel each other. Instead of having professional counselors, uh, they train people to be able to counsel each other. And what Jackins assumed is that, uh, the more discharged the better. And by discharged he meant laughing, tantruming, uh, trembling in fear, uh, crying, even, maybe, yawning was, he said that even yawning may be in that same mix. Almost all those phenomena, by the way, have certain social contagions. So, p-, some people laugh, other people will laugh, which is why in the, uh, in the early days of situation comedy on television they had a p-, when they weren't filming with a live audience they had to put in laugh tracks so the people at home would be able to laugh. 

00:38:40
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:38:45
JAY EFRAN And tears too are contagious in that sense. So, when people, uh, cry, they may be more able to cry. Now, Jackins' approach was a rather old fashioned cathartic approach. Uh, so he just assumed that people were stuck and if they had the right safety conditions they would discharge, and the more discharge the better, and he wasn't interested at all much in inter-, in, particularly in his ear-, the ear-, early formats he used, not in interpretation or insight or any of those things. He thought the system would naturally heal itself if you provided the, sort of, safe environment. So, I thought his theory was not quite correct, old fashioned, but h-, but the technology he had worked out to allow people to move through their upsets, uh, had some rather remarkable elements. So, for example, he found that if you put a, that a, let's say, for there's been a loss. And the person is grieving, but they, it looks like it, would, they are in stage one and you wanna move them toward stage two. Instead of asking them to recollect something s-, th-, the sadness of the funeral and so on, you put together the sad event with a happy event. So, you say to the individual, um, "When was a t-, do you remember when you and your father," let's say the father's deceased, "y-, a time when you and your father were together, maybe on an outing, and it, everything just felt fine?" And, as the person thinks that, that pleasant thought in connection with the fact that they're now gone, this juxtaposition, he found, caused years. A shifted th-, that allowed the person to shift, to make that, to do that processing between that was then and this is now. Uh, one of the things he discovered a-, is that, uh, he and the client took a break and went and got a soda from the soda machine in the building. When they came back, tears were more likely. Because you constantly had to have one foot in the safety of the, of the present situation, and the other foot in the event that was traumatic, or difficult, or needed processing. If you were either all in the present, that didn't do the trick, or all in the p-, in the past or in the memory or re-, the image or the recollection, that didn't do the trick. You had to experience now and then both at the same time. 

00:41:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:41:30
JAY EFRAN He also would engineer crisp sentences for the client to say that embodied the, the image that was pro-, provocative. Such as, "He's gone now," and he didn't want any move-, he didn't want, "He's gone now and he'll never be," you know, he, he realized that verbiage got in the way of the process. That you wanna focus just on the, the, the, the, uh, crisp nub that they, of the, of the issue. 

00:42:10
RICH SIMON And what would that, uh, s-, that seems a, a, a some-, a contrasting point to this, uh, the earlier point about the paradoxical nature of emotion, that it's upsetting, and soothing, and comforting at the same time, um, uh, I think I got that one, this idea of the crisp statement, uh, at, at, what was the point of that? 

00:42:30
JAY EFRAN Well, remember that when people are, are, um, in any situation, including a therapy situation, there's a lot going on. And they're thinking about all kinds of things, such as, uh, how will, uh, the therapist react, what is the, you know, how is this, how do I look? Uh, uh, all kinds of, uh, what, so what this does is focuses the person on the, on the central issue, and w-, and, and puts a, uh, at, uh, aside all other considerations. 

00:43:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:43:05
JAY EFRAN And also, then, by introducing a contrasting thought, as sometimes he even worked with contrasting expressions, he'd say, you know, uh, "Smile while you're saying that." Or, "Frown while you're saying that." The contrast is, it makes it hard for you not to, um, um, make the shift, there's something about you, it, you, doesn't let you hold on to you, the, the position you're in. There's too much of a, uh, there's that, um, that sense of opposites where you kind of just give into the moment. Now, I don't use all these fan-, the fancy techniques I rarely use. I've found, because, again, I'm not interested in the quantity of tears. I am interested in getting out of the way of the natural process. 

00:44:05
RICH SIMON Okay. Now, s-, s-, as you're describing this, and we, we talked a, towards the beginning of this conversation about brain science and- 

00:44:15
JAY EFRAN Yeah, uh, before you go on, uh, I forgot to say and I, I think it's important, with male clients, particularly in an early or first session, when they cry, they may be embarrassed by this. And their embarrassment may cause them not to return. They leave the s-, the session and they go home and say, "Oh, my God, I cried and this was a stranger, I hardly knew the person, and I-," especially if the therapist is another male. They may feel this embarrassment. So, if this happens early on, I do spend a bit of time normalizing the experience. When you have this it's a sign of, of strength, not of weakness. It is to be expected that they might feel a little funny later, and lots of people do. Uh, because I, I don't wanna lose the client. I don't want the client to stay away for fear of confronting that person and going, uh, in front of whom I just showed my weakness. 

00:45:20
RICH SIMON Well, let, let's stay with what you're doing right i-, in terms of, of, uh, this, we can come back to these ideas about brain science at the end, perhaps, but, uh, so, what is it you stand (ph) in any direct way about emotion, and a-, or any of these ideas that we've been discussing so far in addition to the, these very practical dos and don'ts. And what role does this expression of, uh, emotion through tears play in how you think about your work with a client. Do you ever think, "Boy, this person could really use a good cry, let me see how I could help set that up." 

00:46:00
JAY EFRAN Uh, yes, so, that is a situation in which I ask myself, "Is there anything in the current environment that makes, makes the situation less than fully safe?" Because I know that safety wh-, is what will, will allow the process to move forward. Um, so I am on the lookout for, again, with clients who are presenting a kind of stolid, uh, mask or presentation, I'm looking for, "Am I contributing to this in any way, and can I help the person, um, since I know where the shift might be, can I help the person avoid, uh, some of the linguistic, uh, elaborations that are getting in the way of this shift? Can I ask them just to say this simply?" And I say, "Okay, oh-," a-, an by the way, while crying is going on, clients will sometimes want to speak and s-, kind of explain themselves, and, uh, and so on, and I, I wave that off. If, I, I say, "Later, later, let it go." Uh, so, yes, I, and I consider it, um, movement and victory if I get any of the forms of discharge. Again, not because something is something is coming out from inside, but because the system is, is correctly processing some psychologically meaning, meaningful event. 

00:47:45
RICH SIMON Yeah. And so, w-, in, in terms of this, this headier, more cerebral kind of conversation we've been having about tears, is that ever helpful. Do you ever, ever, would you, might you ever have this kind of, talk about the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system with a client? Are there particular kinds of clients for whom that might be helpful information? 

00:48:10
[sil.] 

00:48:15
JAY EFRAN Something happened on the system, I don't know what. 

00:48:15
RICH SIMON Oh, okay. So, uh, did you hear my question? 

00:48:20
JAY EFRAN Uh, why don't, eh, eh, why don't you repeat it, cuz, uh- 

00:48:20
RICH SIMON Yeah, okay, so, Jim will just edit us back to this. So, um, in terms of this, the, this more cerebral conversation we've been having about the underpinnings of tears, interplay between the sympathetic and the, the, uh, parasympathetic, I mean, we, we, we're both, uh, we both promise the audience we'll burst into tears at the end of this competition, to show what authentic fellows we are. But, uh, for the moment, is that, eh, are there, is that ever helpful? Are there particular kinds of clients or situations in which this kind of conversation in itself can be helpful? 

00:49:00
JAY EFRAN I don't do this often, and if I do do it it's usually with a man, not a woman. Because m-, m-, men are so, can be so uptight about it- 

00:49:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:49:10
JAY EFRAN And can, and don't understand the process. 

00:49:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:49:15
JAY EFRAN And so, uh, uh, a bit of understanding of the process, I think, uh, helps them, uh, relax about it. 

00:49:20
RICH SIMON Okay. Now, i-, if the client, i-, in this, in the, uh, issue which your article appeared our, our may issue on emotion in the consulting room, we had a, an author named Jeffrey Van Glan (ph) who was talking about therapeutic crying, and, and, and, and much of it, I think, he was describing, um, something, his version of what you're talking about, a kind of a natural, uh, self regulating and healing process of, of returning. 

00:49:45
JAY EFRAN Yeah, so, and he said, uh, uh, similarly, uh, do very little when, when tears begin. 

00:49:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:49:50
JAY EFRAN So, he and I are certainly on agreement on that point. 

00:49:55
RICH SIMON Now, one of the things that he was pointing to, and this is more his, this is more his, much more his premise than yours, that we've sort of had a, um, as we often do in our field, that sometimes we take certain ideas and we take them beyond their range of usefulness. So, he was talking about with a, with the, uh, with our concern about therapy as retraumatizing people. That some therapists have become even more phobic, whatever natural phobia many of us have, perhaps m-, perhaps males, uh, somewhat more than females of the expression of intense emotion in other people. He had, he th-, he was, uh, afraid that the n-, this natural expression of emotion in the consulting room was being discouraged because therapists were misreading certain situations as retraumatizing, that you were plunging people back into despair. Do you have any e-, do you have any experience of that? That, that, uh, do you, do you see that? Is that a caution that you might give to, uh, therapists that you're supervising or training? 

00:50:55
JAY EFRAN Well, you know, while the se-, while the session is going on I watch the, the expressions on the client's face and their body language very carefully, and as long as, uh, they move toward a, a relaxation, and as long as I'm working with their images and their thoughts, then I, I think you, you mostly avoid that, uh, that possibility of retraumatization. Uh, I think it's only when you do, uh, when you sort of more, uh, actively want the person to do it your way that, uh, that the retraumatization gets in the way, the possibility of it. 

00:51:40
RICH SIMON That's interesting. Let's look at this, th-, this whole issue of emotion a-, and we've referred to this, and we've been basically, uh, talking a-, at it from this, the level of, um, understanding and understanding the nervous system and technique. I-, if we're gonna be effective at helping clients go through the ups and downs of intense emotion that can be, uh, that can be disorienting and scaring, scary to all of us, uh, when we're really in the throes of it. Uh, any, v- 

00:52:10
JAY EFRAN (crosstalk)Which we will, which we, which we will, of course, because how could we not? 

00:52:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. So- 

00:52:15
JAY EFRAN (crosstalk)I mean that's, yeah, go ahead, I'm sorry. 

00:52:20
RICH SIMON Uh, it's, so, so in terms of, um, the, the, the development of the therapist when you're working with therapists and you're, uh, helping them to become more and more comfortable with all the range of emotional expression that people are gonna bring into the consulting room. You have some thoughts for us about how, uh, in addition to h-, having this, a kind of model for ourselves, an understanding of what emotion is and how it gets expressed, in terms of at a personal level for the therapist are there some, some things that you, uh, try to encourage younger therapists, or therapists of all ages to, kinds of experiences or ways in which they, to help them become more comfortable with emotional expression? 

00:53:10
JAY EFRAN Um, I, I think they need to, um, identify their discomfort and where it comes from. And the fact that at, we're all in this culture, culture where we're taught to confuse the, uh, outward manifestation with the problem. And I need for them to unpack that and, therefore, begin to be able to sit with all forms of emotional expression provided nobody is beating somebody up, uh, that the, that the tantrum is safe, that the, you know, safety is the, i-, is the issue. 

00:53:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:53:50
JAY EFRAN And that the therapists I've trained seem to do well with this. I mean, what's been clear this is, this, this doesn't mean something is going wrong, or if it's allowed to continue it will go wrong or that they have to take action. Uh, I think that clears up a good deal of it. 

00:54:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah. Th-, the, the point, and, and we just have a few minutes here, th-, the point that, um, I, I, I was, uh, making a, a, a while ago, and the link between what we're talking about here and what is coming out of the work of people like, uh, Alan Shore and Dan Segal (ph), is the, this, uh, idea of integration. That the, what happens often, people are coming into therapy because they haven't integrated different responses that they have internally, which are at war with each other. 

00:54:45
JAY EFRAN Yes. 

00:54:45
RICH SIMON And that the therapy experience is a way in which we get where we're actually wiser and smarter than we are in, uh, in, in any given moment, particularly when we're able to have those moments of integration. This is, Dan Segal (ph) in particular is somebody who talks about that. Do you find that idea, uh, a useful one and, and these developments in our understanding of brain science, there's been some question about whether, at a practical level, they're really all that helpful in the actual conduct of psychotherapy. What's your view of all that? 

00:55:15
JAY EFRAN Uh, I'm gonna have to ask you to repeat, Rich, cuz, again, whatever this system event is that's said some terrible thing is happening on the computer that I had to cancel. So, I didn't catch all that. 

00:55:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Let me, let me start it again, and then Jer- 

00:55:30
JAY EFRAN (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:55:30
RICH SIMON Okay, last question for you. 

00:55:35
JAY EFRAN I wish I knew what program was doing this, wait a minute, maybe I can- 

00:55:35
RICH SIMON Alright. 

00:55:35
JAY EFRAN Um, nah, I can't tell. 

00:55:40
RICH SIMON Alright, well. 

00:55:45
JAY EFRAN (crosstalk)(inaudible ) Okay. 

00:55:46
RICH SIMON Okay, so, last question. A moment ago I was making reference to an idea that I hear expressed from, uh, or, is this okay? Can you, can you hear me? 

00:55:55
JAY EFRAN Yeah, but, before we finish I wanna get in, uh, uh, uh I think that it's important to answer the question of why, for instance, uh, mothers cry when their brides are being, when the bride, at w-, eh, at weddings. 

00:56:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:56:10
JAY EFRAN I think we've cov-, covered that sufficiently. 

00:56:15
RICH SIMON Um, uh, okay. It's, well, let's, let's see. So let's, let's, um, um, let's just, and since we're gonna be editing this, let's get a segue. So why don't you, um, uh, just bring up that point, then let me ask you my final question and then the audience will- 

00:56:35
JAY EFRAN (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:56:35
RICH SIMON Well, the, the orchestra will swell with the finale and the audience will. So, um, you know, just something, you know, Rich, there's one more thing I'm, that sometimes I want to make sure that we discuss, or something like that, and we'll cut that in and then we'll move to my last question. So it's o-, on to you. 

00:56:50
JAY EFRAN Yeah, when we were saying that, uh, tears a neither in themselves joyful or, uh, sad, um, uh, people have asked, "Well, why, for instance, w-, would a mother cry at her daughter's wedding?" Uh, I remember also, uh, my wife, we went down to the Christmas display at Wannamakers (ph), and they had w-, something called Dancing Waters, these, uh, decorative faced fountains that would go in time to the music and it was a marvelous display. 

00:57:20
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah, okay. 

00:57:25
JAY EFRAN So, when the music swelled and the fountains came on, my wife would tear up. Or, at a wedding, the bride, uh, uh, is walking down the aisle and then they say, "I do," and the mother breaks into tears. And we do that because we, we can go off duty. It's complete. Nothing has gone wrong. The bride hasn't tripped. Everything has worked out. I, my job is done. Eh, and there's a r-, there's the, now it's time for recalibration. So, I just wanted to be, be sure we understand that. 

00:58:00
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay, alright. Well, before I burst into tears and, and go off here at the end of this interview, uh, uh, last question here. I, I made a brief reference to this earlier, we, then we moved on, but I wanna bring back, um, th-, this, th-, this rather paradoxical development in the field that our interest in brain science, this hard science, this multi-syllabic vocabulary of the brain, of the intricacies of the nervous system, seems to be related to a more and more of an emphasis on the importance of the nonverbal, of the emotional aspect of human experience, of the intuitive, um, that, uh, that people like Alan Shore and Dan Segal (ph) have brought into the field. Ideas like integration and emotion integration, now, seem to be scientific concepts, not even, um, not, not particularly, uh, uh, technical, uh, uh wooly, new age concepts. Do you find that any of this, uh, this research, any of these developments about brain science, about understanding the nervous system, uh, it, has, is particularly effective pragmatically, how you operate as a psychotherapist. 

00:59:15
JAY EFRAN Uh, i-, in a short answer, no. I mean, I think it's very nice that the MRIs show what we suspected, that the brain changes as, as we change, but I don't talk about emotional integration, even though I'm totally in favor of integration. Because, for me, integration is not emotional integration. Emotions take care of themselves. It, it's an integration of psychological content. Images, and thoughts, and scenarios. And so that's where I put my attention, and I know that the emotional displays are a sign that that integration's happening. But that's not where my emphasis is. 

01:00:00
RICH SIMON S-, s-, so say a last thing, so that, uh, th-, then maybe we'll need to end here. So when you, that term, then, for you, integration, your meaning to it, what is it, what is integration, and why is that an important part of the, of the therapy process. 

01:00:15
JAY EFRAN Well, in life you need a large enough envelope to contain, make sense of what's happened in your life and open the door to possibilities for future endeavors. And, uh, and certain things get in the way of, of having a frame that's large enough to be useful. So, the integration means really developing a larger frame than you came in with, and one in which events that previously either you had to exclude, didn't wanna think about, uh, had no way of, of, of making sense of, now can be included in what you consider your life plan to be. 

01:01:00
RICH SIMON Great, uh, I like that, uh, I'm not, I, I promise I won't cry, but it's, I feel like I can go off duty that, that, that feels like- 

01:01:10
JAY EFRAN (crosstalk)Good. 

01:01:15
RICH SIMON A pages (ph) enough insight to, uh, to take in what we, the ground we've been covering up to this point. So, um, I wanna invite, um, those, uh, the audience, people who've been listening to us out there, to continue this conversation, uh, th-, that we've begun here today on emotion and on integration and getting that envelope large enough so that we can encompass our life experience and not foreclose possibilities. So, just take a moment now, if, uh, if, if you could for your own sake and for the sake of all of us. Jot down your thoughts, whatever it is that occurred to you as, um, uh, Jay and I were, uh, holding forth here today. Uh, i-, i-, you can ask question, you can make new connections, you can show how your envelope got expanded by virtue of the the conversation. In any case, Jay has, has agreed to take, at least take a look at the comment board, if he is so moved he may well respond. 

01:02:10
JAY EFRAN Sure. 

01:02:10
RICH SIMON Um, good. So, Jay, thank you, as always. I, I feel my envelope has been expanded by this conversation. Appreciate you spending the time with us. 

01:02:20
JAY EFRAN You're very we-, very welcome. 

01:02:20
RICH SIMON W-, we're, we're into, we're into our 40th year and counting of having these conversations. 

01:02:25
JAY EFRAN Right. 

01:02:25
RICH SIMON And they, they've, they've made a huge contribution to my life, than you so much. 

01:02:30
JAY EFRAN Okay. 

01:02:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Nice, good, goodbye to, uh, from, uh, all of you out there from, uh, the network or webcast, see you next time, bye bye. 

01:02:40
