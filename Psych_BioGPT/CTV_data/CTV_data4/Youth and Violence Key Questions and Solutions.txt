PART 1. YOUTH AND VIOLENCE: A conversation with Professional Psychologists Community Advocates and Youths with THOMAS A. PARHAM, Ph.D. and JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, Ph.D., ABPP 

00:00:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D.  Hello, I'm Dr. Thomas Parham, the director of the Counseling Center and the Career and Life Planning Center and as a faculty member at the University of California, Irvine. And I'd like to welcome you to, what we hope would be a provocative discussion, around issues of youth and violence, expanding our perspectives. I'm a counseling psychologist by training, who has been involved in writing research, providing academic instruction, administration. And as I have both lived and traveled throughout many communities across this nation, there is one overriding issue now that seems to be in the minds of almost everybody, whether you're professional or a lay person. And that is this issue of violence. And so what we've decided to do is to invite a group of community guest, to share with us their perspectives on that and we've invited some particular expertise in. To help us to, to frame our discussion, in the hope that we can somehow develop strategies and interventions that might help us arrest a growing tide of violence. In making this videotape we have three or four objectives. The first is, we'd like to increase your knowledge as viewers about the issue of violence as an issue. And to examine, what are the factors that contribute to the significant increase on violence in our society. Secondly, we'd like you as viewers to develop a greater understanding of the root causes of violence and the cultural manifestations associated with each of those. And third, we really would like to increase your awareness of the potential strategies, which might be effective in working with youth, in working with families, in working with communities. And really try to invite each of you to engage in a greater level of collaboration, as we try to arrest this growing trend. Now, I'm actually delighted to introduce ah, a friend, a colleague, ah, who will join us today. And I think you'll ah, be impressed with his particular expertise, I know that I am. And I like to introduce my colleague, Dr. Jose Cervantes. Ah, Jose, let me say hello and welcome. It's nice to see you. 

00:02:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Thank you, Thomas. And I'm very pleased to be here and part of this discussion with you, as a whole issue of violence has been incli, an important topic not only in, ah, the over all community awareness but certainly in the kinds of things that I do as a clinical psychologist. I see basically, children and families throughout the several years of practice, who range from, uhm, a variety of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds. 

00:03:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:03:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP And where I see lots of kids, adolescence particularly, who are involved in either violent acts or violent situations either as a wannabe gang members or gang member types. 

00:03:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:03:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Our kids were coming from very, uhm, disruptive and disintegrated family backgrounds ah, and are really struggling for a place for themselves, with respect to the larger community. And so this whole issue of violence has preoccupied me significantly. And as part of what I do as, uhm, my tenure not only as a, ah, a psychologist in practice but also as a faculty member at Pepperdine University. 

00:03:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm. 

00:03:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP So I'm very pleased to be here and be part of this with you. 

00:03:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Well, it's nice to ah, ah, nice to have you. Now, you and I know each other. We've, we've done ah, some work together, but certainly I think our, ah, viewers, ah, might be less familiar with your work. I wonder if you could share with our viewers, ah, some of your background. And how you just came to be interested in this whole issue of, of youth and violence. 

00:04:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  Well, growing up in the Southern California area, uhm, initially, uhm, I had an older brother who was gang member. In fact, was a gang member head of a large, uhm, gang contingency, if you will, in Riverside... (crosstalk) 

00:04:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D.  Uh hmm. 

00:04:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP California. 

00:04:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Okay. 

00:04:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP And so, ah, I became, uhm, to a certain extent, involved by association until about the age of six or seven. And I began seeing, although not with an adult eyes, uhm, the kinds of things that were happening to him and to certainly many of his friends, who at then, at that time, I was considering part of my family, if you will. Ah, as part of that whole growing up period, I learned over time, in my association with peers, both who were wannabe and, and gang member types, where, and in road that I easily could've gone in myself, that there are several different factors that as part of our talking today, will be to, where we'll be discussing and reviewing that I feel have impacted me significantly. And have contributed toward the kinds of concerns and values that I hold about self and family community, ah, that I feel are important. 

00:05:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm, uh hmm, uh hmm, hhmm. Well, that's uhm, I'm absolutely delighted to have your expertise and ah, to share. And I think, ah, collectively what we bring, uhm, ah, both as, as friends, as colleagues, as ah, as, as cultural brothers is, ah, I think important to share, ah, with our viewers. We'd like to begin our discussion generally today by talking about violence and, and the necessity to expand our perspective on that. Uhm, as we've mentioned we wanna provide an analysis of both the consequences of violence. What are some of the emotional trauma that, ah, is, is, is, is developed as a result of, of, ah, ah, violence in our society? And if we analyze, I think, the notion of responsibility like who's responsible and what is it the people can do, we wanna try to look at some of the challenges that face parents, some of the challenges that face adults, some of the challenges that faced mental health professionals, certainly, some of the challenges that face a law enforcement personnel, health professionals, and really, community representatives because really, we all are in this together. (crosstalk) 

00:06:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

00:06:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. And, ah, ah, we wanna take a look at that. 

00:06:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP I'd like to underscore that whole theme that we're all on this together. And that is easy for us if we live by, live on a house on a hill that we can look down and say, "Well, it's those people." 

00:06:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:06:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Well, this situation involves all of us regardless of, ah, where we are economically or in position. And that, uhm, as part of what you are indicating that we're all in this together, I feel that's an important theme as part of this discussion. 

00:07:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Okay. Absolutely. Absolutely. Let's see if we can define for our audience the, the whole construct of violence. And, and, as you think about using this tape, perhaps what you might wanna do is to stop it at this point and open up your discussion by talking about violence. And ask the people in our audience to define it for themselves. What is violence? To you what is, is, is that? 

00:07:25
WHAT IS VIOLENCE? HOW IS IT MANIFEST IN YOUR LIFE? 

00:07:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D.  As we continue, what I'd like to do is to, to share with you our perspective on, on violence and see if we can really expand the discussion a little bit. If you consult your local, ah, ah, household or, or, office dictionary, you'll discover that the concept of violence is defined as, "The exertion of physical force to cause harm or abuse." The exertion of physical force to cause harm or abuse. Ah, violence is also defined as, "An intense, turbulent, ferociously destructive action of force." And you, you, you kinda get chills even just thinking about ah, ah, about those words. Now, in analyzing those definitions, we believe that it's important that we understand what violence really means. See, much of the literature on youth and violence, much of the discussion that we see, ah, in the media uses the concept to refer to events that produce persisting acts of physical abuse, which result in physical injury, which result in lifelong disabilities, which result in emotional trauma, which result in death, which result in, ah, even destruction of, of property. And all of that kind of physical abuse takes a toll. There are consequences to that. And what's interesting to me is that as we talk about youth and violence, youth, and, and, and, and, and childhood is a time of innocence. It's a time where our, our young people ought to be experiencing the best of their lives in their formative years. And if we look at some of the data that's out now, ah, it, it's, it's very distressing to look at how that intensely destructive action of force, that physical harm that causes abuse and destruction is really impacting the lives of our kids. I read recently a magazine entitled HealthQuest, which did I think, an excellent summary, ah, of some of the, the statistics that confront our youth today. Take a listen to some of these data. Thirty-seven percent of violent crimes against teenagers happen at or near school. Eighty-one percent of thefts against teens happened at or near school. Young black and Latino men, ages 15 to 19 are 11 times more likely to be killed by gun fire than their white male counter parts. And I think the data for white males, in fact are, are accidents and cardiovascular disease, the right one too, for homicide data for our youth, clearly it's, it's ah, homicide. (crosstalk) 

00:10:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

00:10:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uhm. 

00:10:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Hmm. 

00:10:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uhm, youngsters, take an estimated 90,000 guns and 600,000 knives to school everyday, each day. That's what they deal with in, in, in our country. And recently, I think, the University of Alabama, Birmingham, did a study that reported that 43 percent of the inter-city youngsters, aged 7 to 19 had witnessed a homicide. Can you imagine growing up where ha, almost half of the youth have witnessed a homicide already? 

00:10:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm, that's amazing that it's come to that point. 

00:10:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. It's, it, it's, it's, it's startling. Ah, I was on a recent trip to Washington, D.C. and had a chance to, ah, ah, ah, talk with and look at some data from, ah, representatives from the Center for Disease Control. Uhm, and they have a report on firearm related injuries and fatalities, which I think are, are very distressing too. And the data goes back now, I think about four or five years. In 1990, there were more than 37,000 firearm related deaths that were reported to CDC, 37,000. Around the same period more than 240,000 non-fatal-firearm related injuries were reported to them. 

00:11:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  Hmm. 

00:11:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. If we look at the trend back from the mid 80's, which is increasing. Firearm related injuries cost something like 14.4 billion dollars. That's billion with a "B", billion dollars, in indirect cost for long term disability. And what's interesting, and why this is an issue really for most of us, is that 80 percent of the economic cost for treating those injuries, both for victims and perpetrators, are paid for by taxpayer dollars. That is absolutely startling statistics for me. 

00:12:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Okay, it feels like we have lost a, a, an important sense of community... (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:12:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP ...that I hope this discussion will continue to help that unfold. 

00:12:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Right. Right. Now as it, as psychologist, we, we are really concerned with, with also the psychological impact. And so we want our viewers ah, ah, counselors, ah, professionals to, ah, really understand throughout, ah, ah, this video what are the, the psychological consequences to that? And I remember thinking to myself if, if you examine the, the context in which the lives of our young people, ah, you know, are being nurtured and supported, it's almost, uhm, ah, mind boggling, I think, to think of what is it like growing up certainly compared to when you and I were growing up. I mean, it's, it's, it's, ah, it's frightening. It really is frightening. And I think, the violence that plagues our communities, results in I think, certain categories of loss for our kids. And so what I'd like to do is to, to introduce our, uhm, ah, audience to the whole notion of, of loss for, foe(ph). You know, what, what is it that, that, that the cause is, is happening? I think our young people are being nurtured in war zones. I think, what we're, their life is threatened by things like dodging bullets, ah, life is characterized by warding off assailants in school. Life is characterized by resisting criminal elements in their neighborhood, ah, and even parental abuse at home. And so I will contend that our children, at some level, are experiencing a loss of innocence. You know, those, those kind of dreams of, of hopscotch and, and peppermint candy trees and forts made out of wood and plastic that provide a kind of havens for, for security, are all tainted with the realities of growing up in a violent society. I mean, it's interesting to me to, to just look at that. 

00:13:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Well, that whole issue of innocence is something that I deal with on a daily basis with, ah, children in both elementary school and junior high. 

00:13:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Ah, where often times kids will walk through, ah, gang turf that is ruled by, ah, couple of warring gangs and sometimes they literally have to dodge bullets on the way to school. 

00:14:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yeah. 

00:14:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP And then be prepared for learning, that's a whole different reality than probably, from when you and I were growing up. 

00:14:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Right. And we've got to be able to discuss those issues and figure out, what are we gonna do about that? Ah, in addition to the loss of innocence, I think our children also experience a loss of geographical space and turf, as well as, a loss of power, and in those particular piece of geographical space and turf and power, translate into, I think, a child's initiative, uhm, because there's all, there's, there's a simultaneous loss of privilege. And I think that, that many of the losses occur because parents or, or guardians consciously restrict the, the places youth are allowed to go, the privileges they are, ah, extended to, you know, their, their children, and, and their love ones. And the initiative that those kids are allowed to exert, all under the guides they are trying to provide their children with a much safer environment that are free from the predators on the street. 

00:15:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. Hhmm. 

00:15:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D.  The loss of space, turf and power, and their loss of privilege. I also think, that in addition to those, to innocence, to the space, power and privilege, there's also a loss of spirit. There are no spirituality, something that, that you and I talk about. There's an African saying that says, "That what ever is, is in the first place spirit." And it means, essentially that every living thing in the universe is characterized by an energy by, by a life force. And because our children are spiritual beings, first, we must recognize, I think that the violence in our streets dissolves from the self-esteem that compromises on their physical safety. At some level are all factors that compromise and contribute to the loss of spiritness in our children. And I think our children are really grieving about that. 

00:15:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. There's no doubt that they're grieving now, yeah, I see it in, not only in practice but even just driving down the streets. You can see a, a sense of, ah, despair and almost hopelessness as we move our, about our daily routines. 

00:16:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm, uh hmm, yeah. And, and, and what I really want our, our, our audience to ah, to think about, ah, men, and wanna invite us to, you know, really discussed now is, if we wanna expand our perspective on youth violence, at some level we have to consider that a lot of the focus when we're talking about the data and we look at the media images of violence, the data is focused on assault and homicide and other acts of crime, really give us the impression and re-enforces the implication that somehow violence is restricted to the physical realm. You know, that somehow violence is just impacting people physically. 

00:16:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

00:16:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. And I think, however, what we wanna do is really, ah, caution, ah, our, our viewers against that conclusion. And we wanna speak to them about the need to really expand their perspective, you know? Uhm, if we assume that violence is defined as that ferociously destructive action of force, then anything that causes destruction or harm or damage or abuse to other elements ought to be able to be classified as violence as well. And so this perspective, I think, allows us to consider that violence is not relegated only to the physical realm, i.e. person against person, but should be considered in a broader context. For example, we have a lot of our kids and our clients who talk to us about hostile teachers, on stimulating curriculums, discriminatory policies and practices and differential enforcement of discipline and punishment in schools. I think all of those might be able to be considered to be ah, ah, examples of educational violence that is perpetrating our, our society. Uhm, we talked some about political leaders and how political leaders oftentimes provide so little representation for their constituents, uhm, who concern themselves more with, with perks from political action committees rather than issues that impact their communities. Uhm, you know, politicians who, who compromise and sell out their own moral values in exchange for material possession. I think are all guilty of political violence that has an impact in our communities. Uhm, we have a growing homeless epidemic in our nation that I think is, is really just a disgrace. Uhm, we have, ah, incidence of, of racial scapegoating, which get played out I think, in political initiatives like 187, that is ah, Proposition 187 that is impacting us here in California. As well as conservative attacks on things like affirmative action. All those, I think, are examples of, of social violence, ah, that's impacting our communities. What about the, the notion that many people in our community are socialized culturally, to believe that their own culture, traditions and values, ah, are some how less than appropriate? And so now they assume that the only way that I can be okay, that I can elevate my level of esteem is to deny my culture, to not, ah, reinforce and stimulate and affirm my own sense of self in the community that I really have to move outside of my community. And one of the ways that we see that happening a lot is in terms of economics. What about the money that doesn't circulate around the communities? What about the dollars that somehow, ah, as soon as we get 'em on paychecks are now spent in everybody's community but our own? And one of those could be classified as economic violence because of the toll that it takes on being able to, ah, not allow the community to engage in a greater level of self-determination. 

00:19:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

00:19:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. You know, a, a, a, as we think about this whole notion of expanding our perspective on violence and we classify it like that, I wonder if you have any ideas about other ways in which we might be able to, to, ah, invite our audience to consider a more expanded view. 

00:19:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP As I've been hearing you speak, I've been, ah, particularly impressed by the data, ah, especially around the, the school. 

00:20:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hhmm. 

00:20:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Ah, where the data is showing that in school there are increasing, uhm, elements and instances of violence among children, adolescence, a place that traditionally and historically has been a, a place for, as a safe haven. 

00:20:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:20:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP But indeed, we are getting less and less, ah, from that place. Such that, for example, even in here in our own surroundings oftentimes, we have schools that close at three o'clock, because of the fear that people will, ah, get shot up through a drive by shooting, uhm, now called, "casual drive-by shootings", (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hhmm. 

00:20:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP ...if you can imagine that. 

00:20:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Casual drive-by, hhmm. 

00:20:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Ah, they begin to really make us immune to the kind of, uhm, or numb rather, to the kind of violence that's existing. But a couple other areas that have occurred to me have been the issue of family and the impact that a partner or a spouse, ah, or in fighting has on children's feelings, (crosstalk) 

00:21:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:21:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP ...attitudes and behavior. The family, uhm, are viewed as a protective circle, if you will, that strives to develop it's own integrity, it's own sense of boundaries and it's own sacredness. And this whole idea of sacredness, I feel is something that we have, in many respects, lost. But we look at sacredness as the value that tend to get articulated, uhm, within a family structure. 

00:21:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:21:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP As the kind of nurturing that happens for self and the family esteem and the kind of transcending that happens for families that allows this structure to take on new forms... (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:21:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP ...as development increases. 

00:21:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Right. 

00:21:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP And so, as we move from that whole sense of sacredness, I believe, or a loss of sacredness, there is another area that it begins to touch, in terms of that perspective. And that is the role of spirituality. 

00:21:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:21:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  I see this basically as referring to an act of how we hold our sense of spirit, uhm, and sacredness in our daily lives. Uhm, frequently I will see adolescence who are involved in, uhm, either, uhm, drive-by shootings or who are violent actions of some kind, and their frequent stance will be something along the line of, " Well, I don't care if I hit on somebody that day. I only live for today. And tomorrow, who cares?" 

00:22:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D.  Uh hmm. 

00:22:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP I'm amazed by that kind of, ah, speech, coming from a 14 year-old adolescent male, or female. I've heard it from both sexes. And I hear this across the board. And that begins to say to me that there is this loss of place that are collecive (ph), where folks fit in. We have lost that sense of sacredness, that sense of place. That loss of sense of circle that the family has to provide, protective circle and that whole sense of spirituality and where we fit in to the, the bigger picture, if you will. And so those two areas particularly disturb me, as I hear you speak and as I hear the data that you're referring to, and as I hear and, ah, reminded of the, ah, kinds of things that I find in my own practice. 

00:23:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D.  Uh hmm. 

00:23:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP And so, uhm, certainly as we come to this place of looking at perspectives on violence, it feels like, ah, these are some of the major areas that I particularly resonate with. 

00:23:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Okay, okay. That's good so, if we're thinking about, about violence in the physical realm, certainly, we have shared with our, ah, audience the whole, ah, notion of, of how, how pronounced the data is with firearm related injuries, with assaults in schools and just the lives of our teenagers have to, to live and our youth. Uhm, but additionally, it sounds like as we invite our audience to expand their perspective on violence and, and how it impacts youth. Then we want them to say that if you can look at that, ah, violence as that intensely, destructive action of force that causes damage or harm, then anything that does that can be so classified. And so we're really inviting our audience to consider that in fact, there exist economic violence, physical violence, educational violence, social violence, political violence, family violence, as well as you, as well as spiritual violence that really is impacting our folk. And we'd like to now invite ah, some of you to think about stopping the tape and having a discussion about ways in which you see the whole notion of violence being expanded and played out in your communities. Uhm, and lastly, what I'd like to do is to, ah, close this segment by really sharing with our audience that the visual presentation of, of myself and, and Jose, suggest that somehow, because I'm African American and Jose is, is Chicano Latino, that violence is somehow relegated to the African American and Chicano Latino communities. And really what we wanna do is really invite people to consider that violence is a plague, that is gripping every community in this nation. It doesn't matter whether you're white, brown, Asian, you know, whatever. Every community is being impacted by violence and it's up to all of us to be able to do something about that. 

00:25:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES And I'd like to underscore those thoughts ah, particularly around how violence is encircling our daily lives. And while, ah, certainly there are medical illnesses that are pre, pre-occupying us now, AIDS and cancer for example. 

00:25:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:25:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES There is ah, a much more global sense, I've, I believe that is impacting us, and that is our sense of spirit. 

00:25:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yeah. 

00:25:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES The sense that we are connected to each other, that we are loosing drastically and that we are unable to teach our children. 

00:25:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Hmm. But ah, we shared with our audience at the beginning of the tape that we had invited some special guests here to, uhm, give us their views. Uhm, let's see if we can invite them to make some commentary about this whole issue of violence and expanded perspective and see what they have to say. Let's take a look at what some of our community guest have had to say. 

00:26:00
Steve Delgadillo Latino Community Advocate 

00:26:00
STEVE DELGADILLO Which to (inaudible ) days, ah, for me the, uhm, ah, aspect of ah, racism or discrimination, that's a form of violence and, ah, has it's ah, effect, long term. Ah, there's spiritual form of violence also that one has ah, left one, ah, excluded ah, in practicing its own, his own religion. 

00:26:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. 

00:26:25
STEVE DELGADILLO Uhm, there, there are other aspects, I think that can also contribute to, ah, violence and, and that is again, uhm, not being a part of, ah, ah, a society that is going to heal the society. And, ah, be left out of the loop, and, ah, it only begets violence. 

00:26:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:26:45
STEVE DELGADILLO  Hunger for instance, has a, is another example. 

00:26:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Interesting. 

00:26:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Steve the part that I resonate with as you're talking is that whole issue of spiritual violence and how that leaves the individual lost with regard to where his or her place is. But when you add a group, namely ah, ethnicity or, or culture to that, you have a whole group of people who seem to be lost with respect to who they are as a people. And that's the part I particularly hear from you. 

00:27:15
STEVE DELGADILLO And I think that's words(ph) coming from a lot, where the youth are looking for their identity as well as spiritual. Their identity, they're, they're themselves, where they can blossom themselves and find out who they are, where they are and where they're going. Uhm, and I think that's, ah, part of the future that I see that, ah, will only develop in a, in a violent act of some sort. 

00:27:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Hmm, okay. 

00:27:40
FERNANDO LEON Uhm, as you know the violence has been worse. 

00:27:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Yes. 

00:27:45
Fernando Leon La Calle News Inc. 

00:27:45
FERNANDO LEON It's getting worse. Uhm, I can remember growing up, you know, and watched (ph) where I grew up, the things that we did and in a conversation with a cousin of mine, that, ah, about 12 years younger than I. Ah, he made it, an interesting comment to me that he remembered when I was 16 years old and he would watch me in what I was doing that he want to be like me, when he got a little bit older. And what happened was when he got older that he was even crazier than I was. 

00:28:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:28:10
FERNANDO LEON  And so, what's happening, youngsters are looking at the so called the negative role models and are now you know, ah, being crazier than the ones before them. It got to the point where, ah, values, respect, love, discipline, they're all gone and we need to get that back into these neighborhoods. 

00:28:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM So sounds like there's almost ah, ah, a violence of competition and there our, (crosstalk) 

00:28:35
FERNANDO LEON Oh, yeah. 

00:28:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM our, our contemporary youth are now trying to outdo, in fact, the models that they've to looked up to when they were young. (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
FERNANDO LEON We had brothers, uhm, a good example, we had a shooting one night in the neighborhood where, uhm, one brother, and there's four brothers, one of the younger brothers went running after these guys. Jumped a fence, a shot was fired, uhm, by the time I got there, the older brother was telling me that he was afraid that they had shot his brother because he went after these guys, and, and he couldn't find. Once he jumped the fence to find his brother he couldn't find him. So he was practically in tears because he thought his brother was dead. As we were going back to his house, it turned out that some of the homeboys from the neighborhood, got a car, wait around, tried to block the exit. Well, they found the younger brother and brought them back. So by the time we came back to the house, there's his brother standing there. And, you know, he was happy, but I told him okay, here's the opportunity to, you know, to go up to your brother, tell him you love him. 

00:29:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:29:30
FERNANDO LEON You know? For a second there, you thought he was dead, now he's there. He couldn't do it because he has this, this, for lack of a better word, mascara, that he's the older brother and he has to be the tough one and, uhm, but yet he, ah, could not share with his younger brother how he felt about him. 

00:29:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:29:50
FERNANDO LEON You know? And a lot of times unfortunately, ah, youngsters, fathers, ah, wont express their love until their child is dead. 

00:30:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM It's too late. 

00:30:00
FERNANDO LEON You know, and it's too late then, huh. 

00:30:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Thomas, what I'm hearing Fernando also say that I think, it's beginning to echo some of the, ah, beginning issues that we've been talking about and, uhm, this first segment is the whole issue of responsibility ...(crosstalk) 

00:30:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yes. 

00:30:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES And how we tie it in to a larger community. How are we responsible to our brothers and sisters? 

00:30:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yes. 

00:30:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES ...and I hear Fernando saying that real clearly. 

00:30:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM And clearly, that that's the message that we're trying to get across to our youths, to really think like that as well. As we think about this, expanding our perspective on violence, any other, any other thoughts? 

00:30:35
E.M. ABDULMUMIN, Ph.D. Director, African Student Progs., UCR 

00:30:35
E.M. ABDULMUMIN I think ah, as we expand it, we need to look at not only the physical violence, which I think is an end result of a long process but the whole destruction, uhm, of the culture and the spiritual values of many of the people in the communities that we're talking about that has been gone or should I say, destroyed. And I think, ah, this is a result of just a history of social, economic, political and legal inequities that has caused conditions where individuals do not have either life chances or opportunities and many of them are reacting, like, some people think they just go out and look for crime and look for viance, violence but many are reacting, ah, to a situation. So when you take away the culture, and you take away the values, and the principles, and then they're left just with the streets and the codes of the streets and the ways of the streets ah, and then the society is not offering anything positive. So we don't, we don't see hope for going to school. We see people thinking about which jail or prison that they will eventually go to and what homeboys they will hook up with. 

00:31:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. 

00:31:45
E.M. ABDULMUMIN  So, there's been a total destruction ah, of the cultures and the values and the new culture and the value that come out of the gang, which has not been dealt with officially, by the officials who let these conditions, ah, continue, is causing the violence that we see but I think the greater violence is the destruction of the people's culture and their spiritualness and their values that would protect them in the society, ah, such as it, that, that is totally gone. 

00:32:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM  So part of it, we have to be able to do it in a more holistic sense, is really address some of the psychological issues, some of the social issues, some the political issues, some of the economic educational issues... (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
E.M. ABDULMUMIN Hmm. 

00:32:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM  that really resonate with this whole theme of, of, of an expanded perspective on, on youth and violence. 

00:32:30
Jessica Monique Valencia 

00:32:30
JESSICA MONIQUE VALENCIA I'm Jessica Valencia, supporter of Lakaye, uhm, I've just, my main goal is to help ah, my youth, my, ah, my generation and, and get them off the street. Ah, I was in a gang. I've been through it. I've done it and I think I could relate to it and talk about it and hopefully help somebody out there. 

00:32:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Okay. Welcome. 

00:32:55
Manuel Rojas 

00:32:55
MANUEL ROJAS My name is Manuel Rojas, uhm, I'm 16 years old. I go to school in Horizon. I'm from a gang and I, know (ph)when I get out of it and I hope I'll be helping someone too, to be getting out of it. 

00:33:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. Welcome. 

00:33:10
Juan Sebastian Figueroa 

00:33:10
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA My name is Juan Figueroa. Uhm, I am a gang member, I've been through a lot of things so I can relate to most of the things that are going on and I understand, uhm, what's going on in the society and I'm just trying to give here some input so people could, you know, hopefully learn from it and learn how they could help other people and stay away from it. I feel violence is something that goes on everyday like, you know, within every home, it is something that I feel humans are very used to and in a way have, I feel, I have grown to like because you know, violence goes on, I mean, there's violence everywhere, no matter where you look and you know, it seems like just everybody has touched it or have had some kind of encounter with it. Violence to me, is something that you know, it's a part of life you know, it just goes on. It does, you know, most people look at it as something co, completely bad, but, you know, I feel that it's you know, part of life. Everybody goes through it, some way. 

00:34:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM  How'd you get social lesson on it? 

00:34:15
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA Well, I guess, I just, you know, started, you know, just getting into it, just you know, certain things like, for example, you know, as you grow up you start seeing through things, the things you experience, you know, different types of situations you get into just, me personally, you know, I, I was into you know, I start getting into trouble at a very young age just, you know, into school and different things like that. And I feel that as soon as you start getting into trouble and people start categorizing you as a troublemaker, then you start wanting to, you know, get together with the type of people that are your kind, everybody needs sense of belonging. So like, if you are already going towards that way and everybody tells you, you're that way, then you wanna look for the people that, you know, are your kind. So you know, that's the way I started getting into more, a more violent situation and started get hanging out with the people I hang out with now. So. 

00:35:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. 

00:35:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES What do you think, Manuel? 

00:35:10
MANUEL ROJAS  Hmm, violence, I don't know. 

00:35:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES You mentioned that you were in a gang. 

00:35:15
MANUEL ROJAS  Yeah. 

00:35:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES What got you into a gang? 

00:35:20
MANUEL ROJAS My, I just wanted revenge... (crosstalk) 

00:35:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Yeah. 

00:35:20
MANUEL ROJAS ...of my dad. 

00:35:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  Ah. 

00:35:25
MANUEL ROJAS Yeah, 'coz they killed him when I was like, eight years old. 

00:35:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  Who killed your dad? 

00:35:30
MANUEL ROJAS Ah, some enemies of mine. 

00:35:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Ah. 

00:35:30
MANUEL ROJAS  And I just wanted back, you know, revenge and, I don't know. I jumped in, did a lot of drugs and got locked up,, uhm, came back out, got locked up again, and I'm in a gang now. 

00:35:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  Ah, that's pretty heavy, man, to have your dad killed and then feel that revenge that you have to get back. What does that been teaching you? 

00:35:55
MANUEL ROJAS  I don't know. 

00:36:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES How old were you when your dad was killed? 

00:36:05
MANUEL ROJAS Eight years old. 

00:36:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Ah. How old are you now? 

00:36:05
MANUEL ROJAS Sixteen. 

00:36:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Okay. That's quite an experience for you. 

00:36:10
MANUEL ROJAS Yeah. 

00:36:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES So learned right from home, what violence is about, when this, when they killed your dad. 

00:36:15
MANUEL ROJAS Yeah. 

00:36:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  Hmm. 

00:36:20
JESSICA MONIQUE VALENCIA My, ah, my opinion is, ah, I feel violence is a sort of behavior. A behavior that sometimes you react of what you're going through, either your emotions, your anger and a lot of the times is of, of ah, drug users, using drugs. Off your mind, you don't know what your doing so you go out there and think your bad. And, you know and try and, you know, hey let's go blast out this house, you know, you know, all of these, you know, a lot of the times happens because of drugs or because you've been hurt, or because you know stuff like that. Uhm, a lot of the times it is because of revenge and, and uhm, I've seen that happen, I've done it, you know, situations like, uhm, ah, best friend of mine got killed, was shot and killed. I was there, ah, and my situation, my first reaction was, "I'm ah, go after them. I'm ah, get them back." And that's the, the, the slight, sort of violence that's out there these days, is, "I'm ah, get them back." That's the first reaction in a person's mind. They killed one of mine so I'm ah, kill one of theirs and really, we're killing each other because it's Mexicans against Mexicans, blacks against blacks and it's not helping the community. It's just a bunch of violence. A lot of the situations such as, uhm, there's, there's no reason for it, a lot of the times such as like, uhm, the, the King incident, Ronnie King, there was no reason for all that violence but yet, it happened and, uhm, you know, a lot of the times, it's out of drugs, it's out of anger, it's out of the life you lived or simply out of revenge. 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:38:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Welcome back. Now that we find a chance to hear from some of our community folk and, and we've talked about the notion of expanding violence, everywhere I go, I hear people talking about, it, given that, that, you know, we live in a violent society, okay, but why is the violence in our society increasing? I mean, certainly, the, the, the rate and the level of violence that exist in society now is very different than when you and I grew up. Why is it increasing? What we like to do is to ask some of our community guest that question and invite you to have some discussion among yourself. Why is violence in our society increasing? And then we'll come back to you and try to give you our perspective on what we think is going on with that issue. Let's take a listen to the community folk. 

00:39:00
FERNANDO LEON To me, I think, to be in some of the violence, you have some of these movie stars, Arnold Schwarzenegger, ah, Bruce Willis, they're, they get themselves in situations where they're shooting with two guns and, and hundreds of people are, are shooting at them, and they come walking out and they blew away the whole city, uhm, this illusion that, uhm, violence pays, okay. So I, I personally, would like to see, you know, all these craziness of the air (ph). We have to uhm, ah, in, in order for, ah, any of us, that work with you, we, ah, definitely need to continue with, very simple, very basic, and that is in accountability, ah, you know right from wrong, uhm, this illusion that, ah, you know, it's gonna be okay, you, you know, if you feel in here is wrong, then why are you doing it? And, people like us need, you know, to be in their face, and let them know, it's not okay. Uhm, so, I feel TV is number one. Some of the programs that are on TV, on the air, should not be on air. 

00:40:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. It's interesting, ah, for now that we should talk about the, the increase in violence, in related to the socialization that people receive, I think we, we've talked about that as well. 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:40:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Ah, the media socialization that is, is pervasive, both on TV, to the print media, ah, on radio, that at some level, really glorifies violence, but also creates a hearsay to somehow your issues, your frustrations can be solve in kind of 30 minutes are left(ph), without commercial interruption. 

00:40:35
FERNANDO LEON  Uh hmm. 

00:40:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Gives our, our people, ah, ah, you know, no sense of, (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
FERNANDO LEON No sense of. 

00:40:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM of what's going on. But also your comment about the, the, you know, some of thm follow those best images is, is non-reality... (crosstalk) 

00:40:50
FERNANDO LEON Uh hmm. 

00:40:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM ...for lots of, you know, different people, and, and particularly, people of color, speaks to the whole notion that maybe one of the factors they contribute to that rise in violence, maybe the growing index of, of poverty and, and misery that exist in people's lives between the haves and have-nots. And people who just don't have access to that. 

00:41:05
FERNANDO LEON Right. 

00:41:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yeah. 

00:41:05
FERNANDO LEON Right. 

00:41:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. Both good (ph). 

00:41:05
E.M. ABDULMUMIN I, uhm, agree, especially if we look at, and if we look historically, I mean, violence is a part, a serious part of this culture. Ah, and, what we see in the media, a lot of times is not just creation as part of the culture, but also the media lense(ph) and gives people ideas and it, somewhat, acceptable in the culture. It's acceptable within law enforcement. It's acceptable within the military. And I think it's very confusing to people and the culture to turn it off and to turn it on. And I think, ah, the development or the making of Mortal Combat, ah, into a movie, when people had problems with the video... (crosstalk) 

00:41:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. 

00:41:50
E.M. ABDULMUMIN ...is an example of how it's in the culture and the movie will do well among people who probably don't like violence because their children are pulling them in there. I think another issue is that, and we have to look at it politically, uhm, there's always been violence happening in certain communities. And I think, when that violence begins to cross from that community into a greater community, it becomes an issue. So that, politically, we have seen statistics manipulate it. The violence is happening all the time, but now, it's being reported. And a lot of times, it's being reported for political readon, reasons. 

00:42:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:42:30
E.M. ABDULMUMIN But many of us have lived, I grew in South Central also. We lived with violence daily, it was not on the news. It was not an issue in the newspaper. And the only difference, as you were saying is the guns and the shootings. So, yes it's, it's more vicious but they were still violence happening. But now it's become political issue. So it's not just the violence, it's what, I think, the political world is trying to do with the violence. The statement that is being made about the violence that leads us into imprisonment, incarceration, three strikes. And, it also, policy-wise, takes us away from the money and the programs that will be needed to create an environment, and the family structure, and the social structure, and the schools, to keep the kids out of trouble in the first place. It's like all of the money, and all of the influences are on emphasizing the violence, showing it in the culture, and the result of that is more people are failing, and more people are having problems in our society as a result of violent behavior. So it's, it's, it's a part of a culture that is very destructive, that is not being dealt with. 

00:43:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. 

00:43:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES I think what's disturbing to me about that, and, ah, I will tend to agree with you, is that, violence has become interwoven to the fabric about how we interrelate with each other. And so that poses a real problem because it's begun to enter, what I refer to as, our souls. 

00:43:50
E.M. ABDULMUMIN Hmm. 

00:43:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES What does it mean then, in terms of how we build the healing community? 

00:43:55
E.M. ABDULMUMIN And I think it's, it's not the, when we say our soul, I don't (ph) think it's, enters the soul, I think the soul has been, in a sense, killed. 

00:44:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  Uh hmm. 

00:44:05
E.M. ABDULMUMIN So that the youth that are in the gangs, they've been so socialized that the contact, ah, that they have with the parents, and with the spiritual stuff that we're talking about, it's gone. It, it's not effective anymore. In many of the youth, if you talk to 'em, they respect their parents. But, to survive in an environment that we allow to exist, they have to begin to respect the streets, the laws of the streets. And the violence has become the dominant mode in that environment for solving problems. 

00:44:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

00:44:35
STEVE DELGADILLO Uhm, one of the ways that comes to mind, is just that, there were lacks and a lot of these loss if, ah, we say that to carry, a, a nine-millimeter it's just, ah, a misdemeanor and carrying brass knuckles is a felony, or a knife, is a felony. There's something out (ph) there, something needs to be corrected about that. 

00:44:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:44:55
STEVE DELGADILLO And availability of licenses to, to sell guns, you know, from the back of your trunk, $50 license, and you can give your, you're in business. I mean, you know, that, that really, ah, raises a lot of flags for us to say what, what's going on? We need to be more active, ah, and curtail a lot of that, ah, policy that, ah, can limit the amount of gang, numbers of guns that are out in the streets. 

00:45:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. If we assume that all behavior's functional, like you do it because it meets a need at some level. Part of what we've been trying to figure out is not so much why you do things, why do people engage in violent behavior? But what do they get out of it? What do you get out of affiliating with groups, who you thought you now belong to because somebody characterize you like that? What do you get out of participating in a gang? What do you get outta hanging with, you know, the homegirls, the homeboys, in a particular way? What do you personally get out of that? What do you derive from that experience? 

00:45:55
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA I feel that you get a sense of belonging. Uhm, if at the time there's, you feel that you have no control of your life for what's going on in your life. Like, you know, oh, you're not doing good at school, and your parents are treating you bad, and you know, there's a lot of problems in your family, and(ph) you don't have money, or, you know, certain things, you know. Ah, I feel that it, it, it helps you to, to, to feel in control of something... (crosstalk) 

00:46:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Hmm. 

00:46:25
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA ...that you could do whatever you want. That if, at a certain point in time, you wanna pull the trigger then you could do it. Nobody has to stop you. You know, it gives you a sense of, of, uhm. 

00:46:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Power, almost? 

00:46:35
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA Power, yeah, over other people because, you know, people look at you and they say, "That's a gang member," you know, they're scared of you. And, you know, you feel like you can control people. I feel... (crosstalk) 

00:46:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Ah. 

00:46:40
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA ...you know, you, you can, you know, gives you a lot of, a lot of things that, you know, society doesn't generally give you if, if, if, if you don't belong to a certain group. You know, (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh huh. 

00:46:50
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA because every groups gets their certain amount of credit for certain things. You know, you know, smart students get, you know, awards, smart students get this, you know. Other students, popular students go to parties, and you know, hang out and, you know, different things. So, you know, gang members, we feel control over other people, we, you know, we, we feel powerful and you know, that's, that's why I think a lot of us get out of it. 

00:47:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. So, what, ah, uhm, I'm hearing really three thing out of that. One is the, the need for power can satisfy. The belonging you talk about is that need for affiliation, the need to belong to, or, affiliate with a particular group that is like you. 

00:47:35
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA Right. 

00:47:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM But also, as you talked about the students who get validation for that, for being smart, and social people who get validation for going to parties, whatever, the gang gives you a sense of, of almost achievement. In the sense that, in the same way that other kids get validation for being smart and well. 

00:47:50
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA Yeah. 

00:47:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. Other folk, what do you get out of it? 

00:47:50
MANUEL ROJAS  Respect. 

00:47:55
JESSICA MONIQUE VALENCIA The power, you know, I'm bad, you know, and, ah, people are walking away 'coz I'm a gang member, you know. And you get that, that feeling of excitement inside you and you're like, yeah, you know. This is good. 

00:48:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Hmm. 

00:48:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Wow, that was some interesting commentary from some of the community folk. 

00:48:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES There's quite a lot of information, I think, that we've been given that will help us to pull this together perhaps a little bit more nicely for our viewers. 

00:48:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh-huh. And we want to, to try to share with you, I guess, our perspective and try to consolidate some of the, ah, opinions that we saw. What are some of the factors that, that influence the rising epidemic of violence in our society? And, what we'd like to do is invite you to take a look at the, at the chart that will be ah, shown on your screen. And we've tried to divide it in terms of a circle because we want to resist, ah, Dr. Cervantes and I, the, the tendency to provide a simplistic explanation. But there's one reason that accounts for why violence is rising. We think there are really several reasons and so if you divide up the chart, there're various segments that go to explain different percentages of, of, of, variance about why that's going on. One of the first issues that I see almost always associated with violence is poverty. I think there's a, a widening gap of poverty in our, in our society, that in fact, impacts the escalating, ah, ah, ah, trend in violence, ah, with our people. 

00:49:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES I think that's really clear as folks are losing jobs and having to make major moves from place to place that further causes instability. And I think, further causes difficulty in trying to make ends meet. 

00:49:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Uh hmm. So, one category clearly, the rising tide of violence and poverty. What else did we see from some of our folks?(crosstalk) 

00:49:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  That gives a, a second area, if you look on your pie chart and, ah, that is the availability of guns and other weapons. And I think what disturbs me, ah, and I continue to be, ah, surprised at the amount of weapons that are available to youth. I'm talking about elementary and junior high. 

00:49:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:49:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  Uhm, I'm recalling a, uhm, a visit that I did to a, ah, junior high school, ah, a year ago, in Houston, Texas, in fact. And uhm, what, ah, as part of this visit, uhm, there were medical, uhm, metal detectors there that, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:50:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM In the schools? 

00:50:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES In the schools. 

00:50:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

00:50:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES So that folks have to put their weapons and their knives and so forth before they go into their classrooms. This is in seventh and eighth grade. I'm just amazed that we've come to this point. This is not new. This is happening all over the country. 

00:50:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. It's certainly that the weapons that are available now on the street are very different than when, when we grew up, certainly. 

00:50:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Major assault... (crosstalk) 

00:50:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yeah. 

00:50:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP ...rifles, can you imagine that? Young kids having to handle that? 

00:50:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Wow. I wonder how many of you see the availability of weapons that are in, increasing in your communities. I think a third issue that really contributes to the rising epidemical violence is the, the drug and, and crack, ah, crack epidemic. The epidemic is, is, is just, ah, growing, ah, and the number of people who are involved in drug use and drug abuse is escalating. And now are we only talking about use and abuse but we're talking about, uhm, again that poverty factor as people see the sale of drugs and the distribution of drugs as a legitimate means of support for themselves and their families. 

00:51:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

00:51:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. That's how, somehow now that gets involved with, ah, ah, violence as well. 

00:51:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. And how you see their relationship played out, I think, with poverty in the pie chart and also with the, uhm, drug and crack epidemic is that if you can imagine that, uhm, you have children who are seven, eight, nine, who are being given little things to sell across the street. And those little things, of course, are drugs. 

00:51:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:51:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP And they're making, what, 15, 20 bucks a shot? You increase that over the course of the week. Why go work for somebody else when you're making two or three hundred dollars, as a seven or eight-year-old? Imagine what that does to your sense of, ah, what work is about, your sense of integrity and your sense of taking care of the community. Drug certainly has been a major issue. 

00:52:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uhm, uhm, what else do we see? What else do, ha, have we learned from our viewers who are listening today? 

00:52:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  Well, as we've been, ah, talking, ah, to a certain extent, ah, the whole issue of family and community disintegration... (crosstalk) 

00:52:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:52:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP ...have been ma, has been a major parameter, ah, with respect to ah, the, ah, ongoing episode of violence. Because if we cannot take care of ourselves and our, and our sacred circle, then certainly we are available to the onslaught of, uhm, the kinds of impact the society brings us, which means then we have to arm ourselves, and then begin protecting our individual persons. That begins to add to that whole cycle of hurting and maiming and killing. 

00:52:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm, uh hmm, uh hmm. Well, the other things I see and, and I think it was evident in some of the commentary we got from some of our guests is that somehow attitudes have changed so that now, people convey a much, ah, ah, ah, more pronounced sense of being tough, of being mean as a measure of personhood. It's like an order for me to affirm myself. I've gotta be mean, I've gotta be hard, I've gotta be tough, I've gotta be rough. And you've always had those kind of characters, I think kind of played it out in the media, but certainly not to the extent that we see some of our young boys and even some of our young girls. 

00:53:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Yeah. 

00:53:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Feeling like their personhood, their womanhood... (crosstalk) 

00:53:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

00:53:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...is really tied up in the having to be hard and to assume a confrontational posture... (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

00:53:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...when working with ah, or, or, or, or interacting with some of their, ah, ah, youth colleagues. 

00:53:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uhm. And you can see that happening as you have lack of support in the family and the community there perhaps is also disintegrating. 

00:53:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh-huh. 

00:53:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uhm, there is a sense of nakedness, if you will and with that you begin arming yourself... (crosstalk) 

00:53:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yes. 

00:53:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP ...with whatever it takes. 

00:53:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yes. 

00:53:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP I think, as part of that, ah, whole issue is how we, as a larger society, have begun to condone violence. I mean, look at the... (crosstalk) 

00:53:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm. 

00:53:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP ...media. (crosstalk) 

00:53:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm. 

00:53:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP And look what happens there with the kind of movies that attract our, ah, young children, adolescents to come see. 

00:54:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Right, you and I talked a lot about that. 

00:54:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

00:54:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yeah. 

00:54:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  Uhm, I see that played out in, ah, family counseling many times, ah, where kids, ah, who are 10, 11, 12, have been into many of the R-rated movies that have lots of violence and of course, and begin to just play that out in the, into the home environment. I mean, that's not a surprising event to find, yet it continues to happen almost... (crosstalk) 

00:54:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm. 

00:54:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP ...as a daily routine. 

00:54:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm. 

00:54:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP I think lastly, uhm, the issue that's preoccupied me as part of this whole cycle that we've been talking about has been this sense that I've seen on the faces of children and adults. The sense of lack of, ah, of hopelessness and despair. For me, that begins to suggest a whole feeling of losing the part of where we belong. And again, we'd come back to that whole issue of spirituality and where we connect. 

00:54:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm. 

00:54:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP And I think for me that's been the central-most point that has bothered me with respect to this issue of violence. 

00:55:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Interesting. And one of the other, ah, ah, issues that we want to really raise in conjunction with that in terms of the, that loss of spirituality and the attitudes of our youths are, are developing now is that to the degree that our youth began to center themselves in a various system or a cultural world view that is different and move away from things that are in fact indigenous to their own culture. I think they began to adopt lifestyles and behaviors and attitudes which in fact are not characteristics certainly of their own cultural group but also end up proven very destructive for their own cultural group, as well... (crosstalk) 

00:55:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

00:55:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...I think certainly we see that manifest a lot. 

00:55:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. I believe there's a lot of confusion in that arena and when we don't have the basic starting point namely, the integrity and sacredness of the family, everything starts to fall apart. 

00:55:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hhmm. Okay. And so in summary, what do we wanna say? We want to suggest that factors influencing the rising tide of violence in our society include: The widening gap of poverty, the availability of guns and other weapons. (crosstalk) 

00:56:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

00:56:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Ah, in our community, an increasing availability, the rise in, on the drug and crack epidemic, family and community disintegration, certainly it's, ah, it's a big issue, ah, personal attitudes that convey being mean or tough as a measure of, of personhood, a society that views violence as an acceptable part of life and, and almost condones it. (crosstalk) 

00:56:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

00:56:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Ah, and worships it in some respects. 

00:56:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

00:56:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uhm, and finally, the level of despair and hopelessness that really we read on the faces of our youth and so sometimes it's not a matter of what they say but what they don't say... (crosstalk) 

00:56:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

00:56:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...that we read... (crosstalk) 

00:56:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

00:56:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...that all contribute to that. 

00:56:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

00:56:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D.  I wonder if we can invite our, ah, viewers of the tape to think about, ah, turning the tape off and now discussing for yourself, are there other factors that you can add to this pie chart that might help explain the rising tide of violence? 

00:56:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  And because. 

00:56:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Welcome back. We've had a chance, now as part of our discussion, to look at, uhm, ah, some of the perspectives of, on, on violence. (crosstalk) 

00:57:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm. 

00:57:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP And we've been able to detail that a bit more with, ah, the pie chart in which we were able to pull out some of the arenas that particularly, ah, characterize the issue of violence. Uhm, what I'd like to do now is look more so, ah, as, at the causal factors, the root causes of violence. And we've invited our panel of experts that I'd like to then, ah, invite, begin to give us more information and detail about that. 

00:57:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Let's, let's, let's take a, listen to what they have to say. 

00:57:35
E.M. ABDULMUNIN And I think there's several, and again, you know I don't want to give the wrong impression but I think we have to look at this in the context that it's occurring. And for many of the youth, not, ah, fully understanding why they joined gangs, we're given different theories. And once they make that step into a gang, ah, situation, uhm, there's a consequence which could be violence. Whatever history that that gang has, whatever, ah, homeboys have been murdered by another rival gang and even though people are growing up, they may go to ah, ah, ah, retaliate for that. So I think a lot of the violence is survival, is, it's, it's as though something has started that we're not able to stop. And here is a new youngster growing up, fourteen years old, caught in the middle, his brother was shot ten years ago and now he has this gun and another neighborhood has the gun so, ah, a lot of it is self-defense, a lot of it is survival. And I think sometime it's portrayed in the media so this kids are just evil going out to kill someone. But if you look into it, a lot of it is around conflicts that have historically, ah, been going on and this is where we need more methods and I think some other people working with the gangs, gangs to get them to come up with other methods of solving their problems. But currently, the standard method is, uhm, fistfights when we grew up, a knife fight was really serious, a bumper jack was serious, a gun was real serious. Now, it starts with a gun. 

00:59:10
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:59:10
E.M. ABDULMUNIN And it ends most of time in some type of death or homicide. 

00:59:15
UNKNOWN Hhmm. 

00:59:15
E.M. ABDULMUNIN So, uhm, the causes or the conditions again that allow or maintain that community where gangs become so important and many youth would tell you there is, there is a conflict between their family life and their street life. And that, even though they respect their parents, they have to live in the streets, they have to walk the streets and that dictates and dominates how they're gonna behave, how they're gonna react. 

00:59:40
UNKNOWN  Uh hmm. 

00:59:45
E.M. ABDULMUNIN And so the average kid would tell you, "If I have to, I will carry a gun. And I will use it if I'm attacked," even though he may not know why he's being attacked and of the people attacking him may not fully understand the history of the conflict. But once it starts going, it may take months before this one fight stops. (crosstalk) 

01:00:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:00:00
E.M. ABDULMUNIN And then it dies down for a while and it starts up again. 

01:00:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hhmm. It, it raises the issue for me that, ah, as we talk about the, the root causes of violence, lots of people ask the question, why do somebody leave our youths, why do somebody leave our families and you know, communities involve themselves in violence? But your response really begs a different question, if you will. The, the question perhaps is not, why do people do it? But, what do people get out of it? And if we can figure out what they get out of participating... (crosstalk) 

01:00:35
E.M. ABDULMUNIN  Uh hmm. 

01:00:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...and either gangs of violent activity, what needs do they meet as a function of being involved in that? (crosstalk) 

01:00:45
E.M. ABDULMUNIN Uh hmm. 

01:00:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Perhaps then we have a chance to maybe think about some strategies, later on. What do you think? What do kids get out of, out of being involved in gangs? What do they get out engaging in violence? But, what, what personal needs, external needs, whatever? 

01:00:55
FERNANDO LEON Ah, what do they get out of it? Ah, a tremendous high of ah, being a teen born in, in the streets that, uhm, carries a lot of weight, although, you and I know that a teen born is only as good as you are, you know, today because I will gonna be somebody bigger and better. (crosstalk) 

01:01:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Tomorrow? 

01:01:15
FERNANDO LEON Yeah, tomorrow. But there's a personal high, uhm, when you are so-called, looked up in the neighborhoods by your peers. So they get a lot of personal satisfaction but it doesn't last long. (crosstalk) 

01:01:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. So that they can support, (crosstalk) 

01:01:30
FERNANDO LEON So they constantly have to be doing... (crosstalk) 

01:01:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...uh-huh. 

01:01:30
FERNANDO LEON ...something, to keep that, that feeling. And so a lot of times we do a lot more crazy things just to keep that recognition. 

01:01:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. So it's not only, that sounds like validation of support but it sounds like gangs give them a sense of achievement. It' just that the achievement is happening in trying to be, outdo each other and trying to be crazy. 

01:01:45
FERNANDO LEON And, and that what happens. (crosstalk) 

01:01:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh-huh. 

01:01:45
FERNANDO LEON You'll get, ah, ah, one of his own boys, you know, knows that his partner is, is (speaking in Spanish) then he's gonna have to be the same way, you know, in order to be able to, to say, you know, "This is my, this is my home boy, man. We're down(ph), blah, blah, blah." So it's, it's a personal high to get off each other. You know, expect that sometimes it gets to be like a competition with each other. 

01:02:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

01:02:05
FERNANDO LEON Ah, and, and that's very dangerous. 

01:02:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. I think also the atropism(ph) missing too about respect and love and companionship and you know, ah, being able to be there, you know the support, are all things that we look for youth to find, in other areas of their life. 

01:02:20
FERNANDO LEON Uh hmm. 

01:02:20
E.M. ABDULMUNIN Well, I really begin to understand how the gang met certain needs and in a prison it becomes obvious. The first is protection and then there are goods and services. Uhm, in that, in that prison environment, ah, on the yard level, ah, on the grass root level, the gang is a pretty dominant feature. Ah, the higher the security at the prison, the more important the gang in that environment for someone to survive, for someone not to get raped or not to get stabbed. And it's now so dangerous with the wars between the different groups and the prison that the average individual is not sure if they're gonna get out alive because they can get caught in a riot, they can get caught in a conflict, even though they're not involved just because of their ethnicity or just because of the set that they came from when they were on the outside. So, you begin to see that this gang, and I talked about it one time in my research, that it's like a police force at the prison because the guards can't protect everybody. And if you think about the streets, it's the same thing, when the little kid is running around the store or to the store or to the park or whatever. So, it has somehow become a family to many of these kids that, that they can depend on, that they can get money from, that they can get love from, that... (crosstalk) 

01:03:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm 

01:03:35
E.M. ABDULMUNIN ...they can get other things from. Uhm, the more destructive part of it that I'm finding out now, that, in the early prison research, we talked about how the gang culture was imported into the prison. Now, I think the worry for those of us in the community is the gang culture that is being imported from the prison back to the streets. That these youth come out more hardened because they had to live a gang life to survive in the prison environment. They had to choose. They know the importance of that. And now when they come out, it's influencing their behavior outside... (crosstalk) 

01:04:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm 

01:04:10
E.M. ABDULMUNIN ...that the gangs are getting harder because of the socialization that has taken place in the prison environment. They now understand, ah, what this is all about. And then when you, again, you take away. Most of them didn't get the proper education in school, their family structure is not right, their economic structure, their job, ability to get jobs is not right, then the gang becomes more important if he can provide resource. A lot of times we see it in terms of violence but sometimes it also provides resources. (crosstalk) 

01:04:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm 

01:04:35
E.M. ABDULMUNIN So I think we have to look at the reality of that. That it has become like a family because society and the family structure that we have has been limited or in some cases, destroyed. 

01:04:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Okay. 

01:04:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uhm, there was quite a lot of comment noted in, in those kinds of the discussion. (crosstalk) 

01:04:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Extensive, yeah, extensive. 

01:04:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  And, uhm, I think what I'd like to do is kind of have you, have you, Thomas, kind of look at that also with respect to some root causes that you have found significant on trying to understand violence. 

01:05:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Okay. And in, in doing so, what I'd like to do is, is to really invite our viewers to understand that in order to understand this phenomenon of violence and, and the root causes, you've got to get out much like we have done and talk with community experts. You gotta talk with youth, you've gotta do reading, you gotta really examine that. And I wanna share with our folks one of the things that I had the chance to, ah, to look at. And this is, ah, a, a book that has impacted me ah, significantly. Ah, it's a book called Monster: ah, The autobiography of an L.A. Gang Member. And it's written by, ah, a brother by the name of Sanyika Shakur, who on, on the streets of L.A. was also known as, ah, Monster Kody Scott. And the following quotes are, are taken from that book and I wanna give you a sense of, of what he has done to, ah, really capture his lifestyle as an L.A. gang member. And in listening to these quotes, I want you to get a sense of what is the issue that's on the bottom, what is he really speaking to? (crosstalk) 

01:06:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

01:06:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. And I wanna invite the audience to do that. He says, "Tonight was to be my initiation night. And I didn't want to be late and miss out on the activities that might occur during my first night on duty. Bam! I was out the window, sneaking out of the house and in the wind streaming toward my destiny and the only thing in this life that ever held my attention for any serious length of time, the streets." What's he saying? What's he saying there? In another place, he gets to the, the meeting place. "What's your name, home boy?" "My name is Kody." "Righteous? We'll back you with that name. But you got to put a work in." Now, work for our, ah, viewers who don't know, is to find, as a, as a military mission that you needed to, ah, engage in, in order to establish your reputation or to hold your name. And so, ah, Shakur goes on to say, "This is my rite of passage to manhood. And I took each order from the group as seriously, as any African, would in any initiation ritual from childhood to manhood. At the hangout, we smoked pot and drank beer and geared up for the mission." In a later segment, one of the, the gang members stood over him and he continued talking. And he says to him, "I remember, your li'l ass used to ride dirt bikes and skateboards, acting crazy and stuff. Now you wanna be a gangster. You wanna hang with real MS(ph) in tear stuff up huh, Stand up. Get your self up. How old are you, anyway?" And Kody answers, "Eleven. But I'll soon be twelve, in November." And he says, "Damn. I never thought about being too young to join a gang." Later on in the book, they talk about how's Kody has jumped into the gang or initiated into the gang. And once they do that, they now figured that he's able to handle himself. They then turn to him and say, "It's time to handle our business." And they go out. And so as they begin to retrieve and then distribute the weapons, one of them says, "Give Kody the pump." The pump is a, is a shot gun. And they tell him, "You got eight shots. Don't come back to the car unless all eight are gone." Then they say, "If anybody gets caught, you ride the beef. Because ain't no snitchin' here." So riding the beef means if you get caught, you go to jail, you just have to do the time without, ah, giving up any names or information about who else was involved in the crime. They drive the car, they spot the enemy, they're about to engage in a drive-by shooting. And he says, "I looked at my enemies and thought, tonight is the night. And I'll never stop until I've killed them all." And these are people he didn't even know. He just knows that they're different because they're from a different neighborhood and they were a different color. He later on goes on to say, "By my sixth shot, I had advanced past the fallen bodies and into the street, in pursuit of those who sought refuge behind cars and trees. Another gang member tried to make one last dash for a safe area and I remember raising my weapon to him and him looking back at me and then I pulled the trigger and I laid him down. Later on they go back at the shack, they smoke more pot and drank more beer and I was the center of attention for my acts of aggression. And what some of the people say is, "Man, did you see this little brother out there? I saw him. I knew he was goin' to be down. Well, he was crazy, wasn't he? You're gonna make a real good member of this gang." And so then the gang announces his full membership and all provide congratulations. Later on, he's getting more socialization from one of the gang members and he says, "You got potential, because you're eager to learn. But remember that bangin' and being in a gang ain't a part-time thing. It's full-time, it's a career. It's bein' down when ain't nobody else down with you. It's getting caught and not telling, killing and not caring and dying without fear. It's love for your set, your set is your neighborhood and hate for the enemy. You hear what I'm sayin' to you?" That's when they're now socializing, being the person to be. What's the message that he's getting? And finally, I was, I was struck after reading all this, by kind of the last end we dealt in, in that particular chapter where he says, "The actual impact was on my return back past the bodies of the first fallen. My first real look at bodies torn to shreds by gunfire and it did little to me then because it was all about survival. But as I lay awake in my bed, safe and alive that night, I felt guilty and ashamed of myself. And upon further contemplation, I felt that they were too easy to kill. Why had they been out there, in the first place? And I tried every conceivable alibi within the realm of reason to justify my action but there was none. And I slept very little that night, but I never told anybody about those feelings." As you listen to this, the commentary and those anecdotes from that book, I think it's a very telling picture. And José and I would like to invite you, to ask yourselves some questions. First of all, what do you see as the internal and externals factors that contribute to the scenario? Internal means, what's going on with our youth? What's going on with Kody Scott? What's going on with other people like him, internally, that could be centered or, or the cause of him engaging in some of that violent activity? What do you see around you? Also, what are the external factors? What are the things outside of his personal psyche, his, his own sense of spiritness, his own thoughts, his feelings, his behaviors that impact his participation in that lifestyle? Secondly, you and I talked a lot about the idea that, that all behavior is functional. 

01:12:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

01:12:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. And by functional, meaning that since we as, as human organisms are, are really relegated to, to grow, to regenerate ourselves and to move towards self-preservation then most of the behavior that we engage in is relegated to one of those three functions. And so we assume that all behavior is functional. That means, it needs to meet at some level. At some level, what we want to invite our audience to consider is not, why does he participate in a gang? Why do our youth participate in violence? But, what do they get out of doing it? What do they get out of doing it? We want to invite you to ask the same question. And secondly or thirdly, can we develop, once we find these out, more socially-constructive ways to get these needs met? I wonder if we can invite our folk to kind of turn off the tape and have that discussion and let's see what we come up with. 

01:13:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Again, I'd like to add to that if I could. (crosstalk) 

01:13:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

01:13:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP The, the sense, I think, as part of the discussion we've been having from the beginning is that we all share a common blood if you will. We're all interconnected and so as you're examining, ah, the kinds of things that Thomas has just mentioned, uhm, I'd, I'd like to also invite you to look at the kind of how that impacts you and what kinds of issues are coming out as you begin thinking about violence, ah, with respect to your own person or your own family or your own neighborhood because we're all interconnected. 

01:14:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Okay. 

01:14:15
[sil.] 

01:14:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D.  Now that you've had the chance to discuss it among yourself, we'd like to invite you to take a look at, uhm, some of our issues. And as you take a look at the chart, that's ah,- 

01:14:25
UNFULFILLED EMOTIONAL NEEDS INTERNAL FACTORS Need For Love Need For Validation Need for Respect 

01:14:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D.  -being presented on your screen, right now. We have defined and articulated what we think are some of the root causes of youth violence- 

01:14:35
UNFULFILLED COGNITIVE NEEDS INTERNAL FACTORS Worry To Much About Other's Opinions Low Frustration Tolerance Externalize Blame 

01:14:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. -and these factors are certainly non-exhaustive list. But really represent the amount of information we have gained from our own experience- 

01:14:40
SOCIAL ROLES INTERNAL FACTORS Need for Power Need for Achievement Need for Responsibility Need for Defense Safety Displaced Aggression 

01:14:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D.  -or from our own practices or from really some of the discussions as you've heard from some of our experts and a couple in form of the, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:14:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

01:14:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...from some of the youth. And so one of the things, Jose, I think that, that- 

01:14:50
DISTORTED INFORMATION INTERNAL FACTORS Lack of Self Knowledge Distorted Definition of Manhood Lack of Spirituality 

01:14:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Is really pronounced, as we listen to the data, as we listen to the, the scenario from, ah, Kody Scott and the Monster book, (crosstalk) 

01:15:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Right. 

01:15:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...as we listen to our, our youth really talk about how(ph) issue about the root causes is, there are unfulfilled emotional needs. I think our kids have needs for love, our kids have need for validation, to validate their humanness, they have need to respect that are common to all of us except that somewhere in their lives, they are not finding these needs met but can somehow find them met by participating in gangs. 

01:15:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. And I'd like to ah, add to that, that ah, as part of that unfulfilled need, it doesn't matter what ethnic group or what cultural group, ah, you come from. These needs are all the same. (crosstalk) 

01:15:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hhmm. 

01:15:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP We all come from the same blood. 

01:15:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  We all share the human connection of family... 

01:15:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. (crosstalk) 

01:15:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES ...in the human race, if you will. 

01:15:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. And, and thank you for reinforcing that again. And so the question really becomes, not why do they participate? But, what do they get out of it? And I think, what you can clearly hear from some of the youth, to talk about, they get their sense of affiliation, they get their sense of love, they get their sense of respect that is hard for them to earn in some other ways. Interesting. Another category, we would like to invite you to consider, is unfulfilled cognitive needs. That there are, in, things going on intellectually with their cognitive processes where they begin to develop particular mindsets. And, ah, some that I see in the youth that I worked with include, I think they worry too much about what other people think particularly, society at large. And so their, their, their life is again to try to, to live large, to try to live up to a particular image that may be different than the one that they're presented with in the home or in the community. Secondly, I think our youth have a very low frustration tolerance. And there's something about that mindset that says, "If I have to put up with the least bit of inconvenience, I have to strike out and be angry and, and I have no, no patience, you know, to a lot of things that just emerged or that everything does not go, go in my way in life. And thirdly, one of the trends I see is our youth tend to externalize blame. And by that I'm, I'm really suggesting that, ah, rather than taking a look inward, they take a look outward all the time and say, "You must be the cause of my problem. I do this because of x, y or z factor... (crosstalk) 

01:17:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:17:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM ...outside." 

01:17:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm, as part of that whole issue of unfulfilled cognitive needs, we as, uhm, as young children are very creative. And we're, uhm, oftentimes not challenged in the ways that we need to. 

01:17:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

01:17:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES And as part of the barriers that we've been talking about around violence, you can see when that begins to stifle kids' creativity and direct them in ways that are not healthy for, for themselves and their communities. 

01:17:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Absolutely, absolutely, uh hmm. The third category we wanna talk about is, is really the whole idea of social roles, because I think, clearly it is very evident from the, the conversations and from the anecdotes that, ah, people play out social roles in their participation in violent activities. There's a need for power and some people exercise, you know, that, that power dimension. Some people have a need to achieve. I think that was clear, I think in the anecdote with, ah, with Kody Scott, as his need for achievement was about, putting work in. He was going out, putting in work for his particular gang but that, that, that required and mandated almost for him to engage in some violent activity. 

01:18:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:18:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM And so somehow, he felt validated for that, that sense of achievement... (crosstalk) 

01:18:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:18:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM ...that he couldn't get by achieving in other more constructive ways. 

01:18:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:18:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM Third, is a sense of affiliation. There's always a connectedness to the home boys and the home girls and we've heard that, you know, talked about a lot. Uhm, there's a need for responsibility. And one of the things that we've seen in our youth, there's a stereotype that says that our youth are very irresponsible but I've seen lots of responsibility. They just take responsibility for things that are sometimes less, ah, constructive. 

01:18:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Uhm, I think that some of our youth, who, who ultimately get involved in violence, are not involved in violence because, in fact, they are either gang members or perpetrators of violence but really are involved as a measure of safety in trying to defend themselves against some of the predators that we talked about, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:18:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:18:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM earlier. 

01:18:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:18:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM And I think another role that we play is, is I think displaced aggression. Oftentimes, as we find ourselves getting angry with those who are closest to us, it's very difficult for us to deal with that issue. If I'm mad at a parent, if I'm frustrated with a teacher, somehow those people are a little bit more powerful than what I can contend with. And so what I do is I displace that aggression and then strike out to people who have both less value in my life as I have been socialized to believe that, but also are more on my, ah, ah par, you know, par with, with me as a peer. And it'll make it a little bit more accessible for me to exercise those particular social roles. 

01:19:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. As I hear you speak, uhm, about these issues around social roles and, and as I kind of put that together with, ah, the discussion on Kody that you were just a, a minute or two ago, uhm, in many respects, uhm, the kinds of, ah, emotional or psychological issues that you're pulling out around social roles or around unfulfilled cognitive needs or, yeah, even general emotional needs are, are very, ah, particular and general thing to adolescents across the board. 

01:20:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh-huh, uh hmm. 

01:20:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES And so, as I think about Kody, I mean he's looking for a need to belong, (crosstalk) 

01:20:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yes. 

01:20:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES a need to be taken care of, a need to define safety, a need to, uh, develop his whole sense, if you will, around spirituality with respect to gang involvement... 

01:20:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM Right. 

01:20:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES ...because that also exist. Uhm, indeed we're looking at some very basic needs that oftentimes, we lose side of, that is ah, a particular or rather that it's general across all adolescents. 

01:20:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Absolutely, absolutely. We really want to get that point across to our viewers. That it really is, is our fundamental human needs that are just being met in some non, ah, constructive ways. 

01:20:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  Uh hmm. 

01:20:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh-huh. The fourth category we want you to invite you to take a look at, is, is what we call, distorted information. Uhm, Jose and I are very clear about the need for, ah, ah, ah, cultural information and cultural knowledge to support, ah, one's sense of self. And so, as we look on here, I think, the lack of self knowledge is really important, or who you are, who, how do I fit into the world, how do I fit into that and, and, and actualize my senses as a human being, I think is, is distorted. I think oftentimes, our young people, both men and women, ah, develop distorted definitions of both manhood and personhood. So our men somehow assume that, that in order for me to, to grow up from a boy to man, I now have to engage in acts of aggression that a real man as to one who is strong, who is, is, is not made to feel intimidated on the streets, who is, can exercise power, control and violence over somebody as indicative of their strength... (crosstalk) 

01:21:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:21:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM ...you know, and, and stability. That's a distorted definition of that. And again, I see, I think, ah, in terms of distorted information, there's an absolute lack of spirituality. And spirituality not only in, in terms of a lack of self-awareness about their own, you know, sense in life force. But a lack of, of, of connectedness to a higher being, whatever you happen to refer to, to the Creator as. Uhm, you know to understand their particular relationship... (crosstalk) 

01:22:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:22:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM ...with that. 

01:22:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES I really want to add to that, that whole sense not, ah, that connectedness is prompted by role modeling and I wonder to what degree we ourselves become aware of the kinds of training and teachings that we're doing to our own children... (crosstalk) 

01:22:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yes. 

01:22:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES ...our own family members about how we're supposed to take care of each other... 

01:22:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

01:22:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  and so, if we're not able to do it at that level, we're not gonna be able to do it in the wider spectrum of things. 

01:22:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM  I agree. Absolutely, I absolutely agree. Uhm, let's invite our audience now to take a look at, at some of the external factors. (crosstalk) 

01:22:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:22:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM What are the things that we see from the counter of the community folk, from our experts, from our youth, uhm, from the, the anecdotes that we've raised, that really point to factors outside of the individual person but we think, contribute to the root causes of violence. I think one of the pieces certainly is, is history- 

01:22:45
UNFULFILLED EMOTIONAL NEEDS EXTERNAL FACTORS History (Family, Friends) Peer Pressure/ Negative Peer Influence 

01:22:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM - because we've heard people talk about, ah, we've heard you share with us an anecdote about how you have family and friends who are involved in that kind of activity. And so history, at some level, begins to socialize kids into that particular lifestyle... (crosstalk) 

01:23:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:23:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM ...or, or, or behavior. 

01:23:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Well, that whole issue of, ah, socialization, I think really hits into the, ah, ah, the issue of how, ah, we take care of our children and ourselves... (crosstalk) 

01:23:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

01:23:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES ...in a family setting. And so the issue of parental role modeling, for example, plays a, a major role... 

01:23:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yes, yes. 

01:23:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES ...in terms of the kind, ah, how we communicate needs to each other, how we communicate needs to our children and how we, ah, come to a point of problem resolution around it. (crosstalk) 

01:23:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yes, yes. 

01:23:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES I think the second issue, I, is how we handle, ah, the teaching around of events where things are not going the right for our children. In other words, that you should have discipline. 

01:23:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Ah, okay, okay. 

01:23:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Ah, frequently, ah, uhm, particularly around adolescence, we have difficulty being able to set limits, being able to teach what is the appropriate behavior. Oftentimes, that can be involved with other family dysfunction but many times, I think, uhm, we've kind of set our adolescents free without any guidance. We don't even have any ceremonies anymore or rituals around teaching kids to move from one place in the development to the next. And I think we, we've talked before about the, uhm, whole issue of medium. How that begins to play in to this, I think destructive circle, uhm, around that caretaking, the discipline and, ah, the developing of this holistic sense of, of, spirituality. And I think it encompasses us all. 

01:24:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm, uh hmm, absolutely. It, it's interesting when you talk about, you know, the media. You talked about, ah, again that the, the family disintegration and the, the, ah, use of, of discipline. You know, the two, the discipline piece for me is, is particularly important because, ah, as we think about root causes, oftentimes, when parents, ah, that you and I see in, in family therapy and, and counseling, we try to invite them to look at ways in which they socialize their kids, sometimes implicitly to use violence and, ah, verbal abuse as a way to resolve differences because that's exactly how they end up treating their kids. 

01:25:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:25:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM And so what masquerades for discipline is in fact, punishment and sometimes, a very severe... (crosstalk) 

01:25:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:25:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM ...ah, punishment and abuse. Ah, that, that not only takes a physical toll but takes a psychic, spiritual toll as well because our kids are learning. That's the only way for them to now deal with problems, to deal with issues in their life, is to yell, howl, scream and be aggressive or to engage in some kind of physical assault on the person who they have a disagreement with. 

01:25:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm, absolutely. 

01:25:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. 

01:25:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES And when we evolve to the point where we have children killing other children and we find that across the board in our newspapers, regardless of ethnic or cultural group, it begins to say to us, "Hey, something is wrong." 

01:25:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yeah, yeah. 

01:25:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES And we need to do something about it now. 

01:25:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM Absolutely. Other factors that we think in terms of, ah, ex, external, ah, ah, to the person, I think peer pressure and negative peer influence is a big one. I mean, it's hard growing up, being a youth nowadays. And I remember having a struggle with peer pressure myself but nothing like what our kids have to do today. 

01:26:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:26:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM  And what are we doing really as a community to counteract some of that? Uhm, we talked about family disintegration but, and, and family disintegration I think leads to another factor in which we talk about family neglect. We've got, ah, absent fathers, all, in, in absentee, ah, of fathers in particular, I think which we see is, is more pronounced is not only about physically being absent but there are a lot fathers in fact, that we work with who are there in the home but are psychologically absent to provide the kind of nurturance and support and love and, and all those psychological needs that our, that our kids had. 

01:26:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:26:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. We look at, at lack of accountability I think that you talked about in terms of setting parameters and levels and limits for kids... 

01:26:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:26:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM ...as well, as we find even abusive mothers. Certainly we've seen some, some national headlines, recently, that really point to, ah, to that particular issue. Uhm, other external factors, we look at hostile neighborhoods and environments. The fact that our kids are growing up in, in literally, war zones. Uhm, and, and what else have we heard in terms of external factors? Why do kids are angry? Why are they frustrated? Why do they have a sense of hopelessness and, and despair? One of them I think is a lack of legitimate career options. What am I gonna do with my life? Well, I have nothing else to do. Let me just go and tear something out and be destructive. 

01:27:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:27:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Uhm, we've talked about negative images on television and the media. I think is, is a big one that we wanna pay attention to. Uhm, the lack of positive community activities and those are really important because in an age of, of budget cuts in the age of, of, of funny restrictions, the things that typically get cut are those human services that provide alternatives for some of our young people who are out on the street, engaging in destructive behavior. 

01:27:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  Uh hmm. 

01:27:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM We're talking about jobs, not just for the summer, but even, you know, all year long. We're talking about activities at the boys clubs, at the local Y's(ph) at some of the, you know, local churches. Ah, we're talking about, ah, recreational activities that exist in some of the, the, the parks, uhm, and, and play centers around various cities and, and rural areas around the country. All those lack of community activities, I think, make a big difference there. 

01:28:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES You, to me are spilling out a much wider perspective in terms of how we should be addressing this issue of violence... 

01:28:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. 

01:28:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  and that is to see it as a one-on-one kind of situation, I think is very short-sighted. 

01:28:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh-huh. 

01:28:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  I think there are several societal factors within our community that, uhm, begin to spell out many of the losses and, uhm, I think difficulties with respect to the support of, ah, the family... 

01:28:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yes. 

01:28:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES ...and as you're spilling out just simple the services. I mean, at, ah, not as long ago, as maybe five or ten years ago, we had schools that would provide after daycare... (crosstalk) 

01:28:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

01:28:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES ...childcare... (crosstalk) 

01:28:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yes. 

01:28:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES ah, or after school programs. Now as I, I think we've talked about it earlier, we have schools now closing up at 3 o'clock for fear that they're going to get hit up by a gang member. 

01:28:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

01:28:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES And that's happened. 

01:28:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

01:28:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES And so certainly, we are in a place where, we're needing to recognize how we have kinda starting to dry up the kinds of services we're offering to children to help them develop. 

01:29:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm, uh hmm, absolutely. And in fact, speaking of the school piece, we don't wanna lose sight of the fact that, when we go back to our definition of, of educational violence that oftentimes, a lot of our kids have told us, and we've heard from our own, ah, ah, clinical experience, that school is oftentimes a hostile environment for many of our young people. And the way they learn to deal with that hostility is through aggressive behavior and we've got to look at that, as well. 

01:29:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES There's a saying that you taught me. And that is, uhm, it goes something like this, I think, "I am, because we are... 

01:29:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yes. 

01:29:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES ...and because we are, therefore I am." 

01:29:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM That's right. 

01:29:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES That speaks to that whole sense of community and caretaking. 

01:29:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Absolutely. We've got to be in this together. All, in summary, what we wanna do is invite you to take a look at, at categories, ah, that really account for that. We think their unfulfilled emotional needs, unfulfilled cognitive needs, social roles and distorted information. We also want you, invite you to look at both internal factors, internal to the youth themselves, as well as external factors in the environment because understanding the root causes allows us then to say, "Okay, if we understand what's causing it, how do we then develop appropriate interventions to look... (crosstalk) 

01:30:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:30:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM ...at that?" Let's take a look at, at some of those as well. 

01:30:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm.

PART 2. YOUTH AND VIOLENCE: A conversation with Professional Psychologists Community Advocates and Youths with THOMAS A. PARHAM, Ph.D. and JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, Ph.D., ABPP 

01:30:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  We've had a chance to look at violence from a number of different perspectives. We've looked at the overall view of violence with respect to, uhm, parameters. We looked at the, view of violence with respect to cognitive factors. And we tried to implement that with, ah, dialogue that helps to detail some of those issues. 

01:33:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

01:33:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uhm, I think it'd be good to invite, uhm, our, uhm, community experts to be, in giving us some insight about that particular with respect to, ah, what do we do? Where are we at this point? Ah, what kind of interventions or strategies do we begin to think about? 

01:33:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yes, certainly everybody's asking us that question, so now that we understand violence. What do we do about that? 

01:33:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:33:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yeah. 

01:33:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES So, please, let's turn to our community of experts and see what we've come to at this point. 

01:33:40
STEVE DELGADILLO  The only thing that comes to mind quickly is just, ah, a lack of balanced funding for programs. Ah, you see the indicators already that were, yet we're only 25 percent of the population here in, in the County of Oranges: Mexicano, Latinos, Chicanos; yet, we're 75 percent of the gang population. There is an indicator that there, we're not doing enough as administrators either with programs that are culturally appropriate, uhm, or funding programs, ah, and that, and that needs to be turned around. Ah... (crosstalk) 

01:34:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM So one, so one strategy then is, is more funding for programmatic initiatives... (crosstalk) 

01:34:20
STEVE DELGADILLO That's right, (crosstalk) 

01:34:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM ...that are designed to address... (crosstalk) 

01:34:20
STEVE DELGADILLO that's right. (crosstalk) 

01:34:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM ...some of these issues? (crosstalk) 

01:34:20
STEVE DELGADILLO That's one of them. 

01:34:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. 

01:34:20
STEVE DELGADILLO That's one of them. 

01:34:20
E.M. ABDULMUMIN  And one concept that we're using in African, ah, psychology is the concept of the Maafa. And basically, we're talking about all these conditions, from slavery, destroying the family to people being disconnected from their culture, from their religions, from many important things that would carry the values, that, that, that would teach them that life is important, that, uhm, respecting people is important, that being responsible is important. And I think one of the strategies is to try to undo the effects of the Maafa. The things that has caused our youth to go astray, not to care anymore, not to love anymore, ah, not to even have any hope, you know, to grow up in a neighborhood and expect to go to San Quentin or Folsom or be on death row. That's really something very dangerous that we have allowed to happen because they have been so disconnected from anything that they know. They're just left with the streets and the reality of the streets is that you would get in trouble and you will go to jail. And now, there are three strikes and we have some youth, ah, pleading guilty to three strikes like it's nothing. I'll go hang with my hang, homeboys. This is 30, 25, 30 years so, so the effects of the Maafa has taken away any of the real sense of the things that were, ah, in the culture. And it's as though one of the strategies is to undo those effects in the sense to try to have a rebirth of understanding of that individual. This is what a human being is about. This is what your ancestors, in their best form, were about. This was the religion. This was the culture. This was life. People respected elder, elders. So this has to be redone because now in the culture that we have, that is not talked about. These kids are in the individualism. It's me. They don't care about their families. They don't care about the mom or the dad. They care about mom and dad when they're in front of them but when they hit the streets, they have to go by the law of the streets. And then, I think the third part, ah, saying coffer(ph) we need to talk about healing, ah, teaching people to love themselves, to loves, to love others, to contribute good to the community. And I've seen it in the work that I've done in youth authority that once that we have been able to reach to education and our religion, and then the religion case has been mostly Islam, that we have been able to get them to become political in a positive way. And, and the political consciousness which many people are afraid of says that crime against myself and others is wrong. 

01:36:50
STEVE DELGADILLO  Uh hmm. 

01:36:55
E.M. ABDULMUMIN That participating in drug dealing, and, and gun selling and murder is wrong. And that they begin to love themselves, their community and they wanna go out and help others. So I think the ones that we worked with, that we see who have changed, they've come to this level of consciousness. They no longer wanna be a part of that Maafa, the disconnection from their culture, the disconnection from their real self. So I think the strategies that we have to look at has to be the remake. 

01:37:15
STEVE DELGADILLO Uh hmm. 

01:37:15
E.M. ABDULMUMIN And we talk about rights of passes programs and many other different kind of program. We have to go and we have to gather early eight, because now it's, before gang member was 18 and then they were 14. Now, kids as early as ten may identify and become a gang member and carry a gun and commit a crime. 

01:37:30
STEVE DELGADILLO  Uh hmm. 

01:37:35
E.M. ABDULMUMIN So we have to get to them at an early age and undo the effects of this thing that has disconnected them from what is right and what is wrong and what is just and fair, ah, in society. 

01:37:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  I like that term that you refer to as rebirth because I think it speaks to the core of a person's essence, namely, that it begins to open up a sense of who they are and why they're here and what are purposes about. 

01:37:55
E.M. ABDULMUMIN Uh hmm. 

01:37:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES That's what I hear you say. 

01:37:55
E.M. ABDULMUMIN Yes. 

01:37:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Could you, in, in something like the strategy there really speaks to the whole notion of, of reenergizing and revitalizing the spiritual essence of the individual, though that some are either been lost or killed or destroyed. 

01:38:10
STEVE DELGADILLO Uh hmm. 

01:38:10
E.M. ABDULMUMIN Without no moral, spiritual, ah, ah, ah cu, ah, aspects to a person's culture. 

01:38:15
STEVE DELGADILLO Uh hmm. 

01:38:15
E.M. ABDULMUMIN It's dangerous in the society then they become the movie. 

01:38:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

01:38:20
E.M. ABDULMUMIN They become all the things that they see in the movie because there's no moral cut-off. 

01:38:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

01:38:25
STEVE DELGADILLO Uh hmm. 

01:38:25
E.M. ABDULMUMIN Survival was just surviving in the streets. There is no life after death. There is no, they don't know any of that. They're not concerned about it. There are no ancestors. They don't have to pay any dues. They don't have to do good to their culture to make their culture look good anymore. They're not a part of that, they're just about themselves. 

01:38:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES So that, who becomes responsible for teaching the moral cut-off if the media is not gonna do it? 

01:38:45
E.M. ABDULMUMIN Yeah. And I think we always say go back to the family. But the family needs help and I think, ah, we do have good families so I don't wanna say that. We know in many of the barrios and the ghettos, so-called ghettos and barrios, that many family people, even single people raise children in a good way. 

01:39:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:39:05
E.M. ABDULMUMIN So it's still there. We still have people who can do a good job. 

01:39:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:39:05
E.M. ABDULMUMIN But we also lose too many. 

01:39:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  Uh hmm. 

01:39:10
E.M. ABDULMUMIN To the crime and to the violence. And that's where the mental health people, the teachers, ah, the institutions, even such as the church, whatever, have to come together in a new process, in a new community process to redo this whole thing, to develop a child that can know right from wrong, that can have a resource and some type of guidance that, at different levels. There has been a lot of curriculum that has been done when they're not adding, ah, ah, trying to teach moral philosophy as early as the first and second grade to think about. When you kill somebody, what happens? Is it right to kill? Let's discuss that. And I think in our classrooms that are not being discussed. So if you tie that with culture, with, with the person's spiritualness in some examples, I think we could begin to rebuild. But it's a job for everyone in society, especially that has their hands on our children... (crosstalk) 

01:40:00
STEVE DELGADILLO Uh hmm. 

01:40:00
E.M. ABDULMUMIN ...before they become teenagers. Ah, that we have to be effective and then the program has to continue until we get them into adulthood where they're okay... (crosstalk) 

01:40:10
STEVE DELGADILLO Uh hmm. 

01:40:10
E.M. ABDULMUMIN ...because we know the obstacles, they call it the ghetto maze. They have to make it through... (crosstalk) 

01:40:10
STEVE DELGADILLO Uh hmm. 

01:40:10
E.M. ABDULMUMIN  that maze of crime, of drugs, of prison, et cetera. And most of them are very difficult on the, only to make it through the maze. 

01:40:20
STEVE DELGADILLO Uh hmm. 

01:40:20
E.M. ABDULMUMIN Last thing, I think another example is on the use of theory that I'm working. Uhm, University of La Verne has a college program and recently, at the graduation, we graduated four Bachelor's degrees and eleven Associate Art degrees and we have strong research to show that this educational process is effective in turning, ah, these guys around. Not only that these are people who had been written off because if they're at the institution that I'm talking about they've been in trouble a lot of times. So, when we talk about what the mental health professionals can do is I think we need to tap in to some of the creativity and some of the energy of these youth who if they're put in the right environment and given the proper opportunity, they can do it. You know, they don't have to wait 'til the end of the youth authority doing a life sentence to get a bachelor's degree when they can be put on that track. But I think we have a lot of examples of where things can work if the environment is right, that, that many of the youth are willing. But we have to help them to deal with that maze and to deal with their peer pressure and all of the other elements to pull away which is a very difficult process. 

01:41:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM But it sounds like also, that, that one of the interventions that is happening in, ah, the prisons and the, the, the, ah, you know, institutions of incarceration... (crosstalk) 

01:41:35
E.M. ABDULMUMIN Uh hmm. 

01:41:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM ...are that once people reached that bottom, they have found a way in, in some small measure to instill in them a belief that somehow if you do this it might provide you with a better sense of, or quality of life. But we're somehow weren't able... (crosstalk) 

01:41:50
E.M. ABDULMUMIN Uh hmm. 

01:41:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM ...to instill that info while they were out on the street... (crosstalk) 

01:41:50
E.M. ABDULMUMIN Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

01:41:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM ...growing up so that they'd lost at that sense of hope and, and, and, ah, ah. 

01:41:55
E.M. ABDULMUMIN And there, and there're two systems, so, there's a youth authority... (crosstalk) 

01:42:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM Right. 

01:42:00
E.M. ABDULMUMIN ...also worked as a psychologist and the adult system, there is no hope there. (Laughs) 

01:42:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. 

01:42:05
E.M. ABDULMUMIN So at the youth authority level, there is some hope but there are attempts and I think the Pill Grants were cut back for, ah, tuition for school and, et cetera. So their constant attempts just to get tough and to imprison people and to make them do a lot of time so that these programs are even in danger, the few that are working. And if we go to the adult system, there is no attempt to really do anything like this. Ah, what's happening there is strictly punishment and that's where we get the three strikes, the belief that if someone continues to do crime three times then they'll probably do it for the rest of their lives so you lock them up, a life sentence, no matter what the third strike is. So we have to understand that there, we, we're talking about two, we're talking about the youth and we're talking about the adults. And once people reach that adult system, it's gonna be much more difficult. And that's why it's so important to intervene early... (crosstalk) 

01:42:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM Early. 

01:42:55
E.M. ABDULMUMIN What, where we see the success. 

01:42:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. 

01:42:55
STEVE DELGADILLO I just wanted to add just one thing, ah, with regard to the programs to, to develop, ah, in a youth, strategies that will help them with the physical part, the mental part, the social part, ah, they're all very important and, ah, emotional and creative also. (crosstalk) 

01:43:10
UNKNOWN The spiritual. (crosstalk) 

01:43:10
STEVE DELGADILLO Ah, so the spiritual is, is right in there as, ah, so I would say my druthers would be number one. 

01:43:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. As you think about interventions that go on in life and a lot of people who say, share something we can do to arrest the tide of violence. A lot of those solutions are designed without your input. If you could really talk to America and say, here are some concrete specific things you could do to help us begin to address this issue, what would you recommend? What should they be doing? What is the start? 

01:44:00
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA I've, actors, you know, it, it starts, I think, by, by accepting the fact that it's there and it could happen to anybody, you know. And, you know, and I feel that it's gonna keep on growing as long as people keep on alienating us, you know, like, you know, treating us like we're from a different planet, you know. Oh, you know, that's not in my neighborhood so they don't wanna deal with it, they don't wanna, you know. They just seem to, like, think of it like, oh, you know, I don't know any game or so I don't care, you know. It just certain things like, for example, you know, gang members, yeah, you know, they, we do a lot of bad things and you know. I personally feel that gangs are even designed from what we see in the world today. I mean, everything that goes on in gangs has something to do with the world. Economy, I mean, selling drugs are for the economy, you know, for making money. Territory, you know, every country in the world needs territory. Here, you see countries trying to take over other places because they have oil and because, you know. You, you see gang members killing gang members, of course, you know, wars. There's wars going on in the world every day. You know, there's things going on in the world that people seem to say, you know, where did these kids come up? Or you know, where are they from? Where are they seeing all these? And we're seeing it in the world. I mean, the world is like that and I think gangs are just mimicking what the world is doing everyday, you know. 

01:45:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Fantastic. So what do we do? What do we do about that? 

01:45:25
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA Hhmm, we just, I feel that, you know, people should take more time to understand us and, you know, not, not so much time to try to convict us, (laughs) and then convict us because, that, it seems like that's what everybody is trying to do, just get us from, get us off to streets like this three strike law. I mean, yeah, you're gonna get everybody, every other critic(ph), you know, you're gonna get everybody that has three felonies in jail but when their sons see it and they go see daddy every day in jail, I don't think, that's no big deal. "Okay, my dad's in jail for life." And jail's just gonna packed up and it's gonna become a way of life just like gangs are. You know, just like, you know, somebody shots somebody and then sooner or later, became no big deal. And now, everybody's shooting everybody. And, you know, getting everybody in the jail is not gonna help any because sooner or later, people are just gonna start saying, "It doesn't matter, there's a lot of people in jail anyway." Just like there are a lot of people killing each other. 

01:46:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM We've heard this, ah, various segments of society. We've heard our different panelists. Certainly, Dr. Cervantes and I, have overly acknowledged that. There are some segments of our communities across this nation who are very afraid, who are very scared. And on one hand, we talked about that fear that people experienced as being a sign of respect or, or power, in fact, that, that, that should cultivate. But on the other hand, things like three strikes, things like, you know, these are the kind of programs that they have, are designed to, to, in their minds insulate society away from this kinda element of people who cause us to experience this fear. But sounds like what you're, what you're telling us is all you're doing is sort of perpetuating the problem not in the solving. (crosstalk) 

01:47:10
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA What, we'll see, uhm, what I'm saying is that, you know, yeah I might keep all the other social groups out of it but that social group that's already into it is just gonna make it grow and grow. (crosstalk) 

01:47:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hhmm. 

01:47:25
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA You know what I mean? 

01:47:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

01:47:25
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA Because, I mean, a lot of us gang members have kids and a lot of us gang members, you know, have nieces and s, you know, brothers and uncles and, you know, everything like that. We're normal people, we have family, so, you know, if I get locked up for three strikes, I already have two, you know. If I get locked up for three strikes, you know, I'm looking, you know, 25 to life, you know. Who says my younger brother's gonna look at that and say, "Oh, my brother's locked up for life," you know. He might look at it like saying, " Hey, well you know, my brother's locked up for life, you know, that sucks." Or he might say, "You know what? It's no big deal and my brother's locked up for life." And everybody's looking at it like that and sooner or later, you know, people are gonna look at it like it's no big deal. 

01:48:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hhmm. 

01:48:05
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA And you're just gonna, you're just gonna lock up everybody, if that's what they wanna do then that's on them. 

01:48:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM What is that? 

01:48:10
JESSICA MONIGUE VALENCIA  It's also weird because I think, uhm, majority of the gangs are here, are running for the mafia. Mafia comes within the prisons. So, if they're gonna lock up somebody and they become from that environment, it's just gonna make things worse. It's gonna make situations worse, worse, like, say, homeboy, ah, get somebody on the house, you know, and somebody wants to take good care of him there because he gets busted for, he's gonna die in there, you know. War gets around, you know. I've seen it, we'll get from Chino to, you know, up to Quentin, you know, just like that. And, and it's funny 'coz they can't send postcards to each other but they get the word. They get the word that this needs to be happening. So by locking up somebody, it's not gonna help. (crosstalk) 

01:49:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:49:01
JESSICA MONIGUE VALENCIA It's just gonna, you know, aid, this war goes down, then you take care of that homeboy out there and that's where it all starts. And another thing is, uhm, we need people out there that could relate 'coz I felt, when I was locked up, a couple of probation officers I had were like, they didn't know nothing, you know. My brother passed away and I told them about it. "Oh, I know how it is. I know how it is." You know, that's not right. You don't know how it is. You don't know how it is to live in the barrio. You don't know how it is when you're standing in front of somebody and they have a gun towards you. You don't know how it is 'coz you haven't lived it. And just because these people gone to colleges and got so much, you know, degrees, and, and studied all this, uhm, ah, criminology and all, whatever they study, they think that they know it and they could do something about it. But it's not like that. You need somebody that can relate, that knows how you've been, you know, what you're going through. In my situation, I'm helping out my younger generation and my generation because I've been there. I've done that. I've been busted, I've been to the barrio, I've been with the dyfa, dysfunctional family, I've been through the drugs, I've been through all that. I've lost people in my life that really meant a lot to me. And, you know, and when I hear somebody come up and tell me, "I just lost my sister." The, then I could turn around and say, "Hey, you know what? It's all right, you know. We'll try and deal with it, you know. I know how you feel." And that person could turn around and say, "Yeah, you know how I feel," instead of saying, "Yeah, right." And that's when they shut down. That's what, you know. It's not gonna happen. 

01:50:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES So Jessica, it sounds like in part of you're saying, not only do we need more people that can relate, but also more people that are willing to be honest. 

01:50:45
JESSICA MONIGUE VALENCIA Yes. 

01:50:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES And work around that honesty with each other. 

01:50:45
JESSICA MONIGUE VALENCIA  Exactly. 

01:50:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:50:50
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA I feel you can't do much because, I mean, a lot of families, you know, they don't have time to teach you how you need to grow up. A lot of which you turn is society, you know. Most of the things that society does to impact your life, that's the way that you, you know, that's why you are the way that you are, you know. Just certain things that go on in society which you see everyday, you know. That's what makes you think of, I mean, yeah, my mom told me don't deal drugs but, you know, I still did it. Yeah, and my mom told me not to do this, yeah, you're mom tells you don't steal but some people still do it. I mean, it's what you see around you, I mean, if you see how your friends stealing, you see all your friends pip, shooting people and selling drugs, you see that as an easy way to make money, you're gonna do it. 

01:51:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM Would, ah, I, I've heard you a couple of times refer to the, the economy of a gang as a way to make money. 

01:51:40
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA Right. 

01:51:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM  And we talk a lot about the whole notion of poverty. Had your economic circumstances been different in your families? Would you wound up in gangs or, or participate in that? 

01:51:55
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA Na, go ahead. 

01:51:55
JESSICA MONIGUE VALENCIA I think I would've. I think I went the path that I went because I wanted to. My parents were never there for me but I'm not blaming them for the reason why I got jumped into my barrio. 

01:52:05
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

01:52:05
JESSICA MONIGUE VALENCIA I'm blaming me and I'm blaming, you know, I, I can't blame anything else 'coz it was my decision, you know. I could've said no, no, you know, it, you know, I'll kickback, you know, I don't wanna be from the barrio. But no, I say, yeah. And, and, at that time I used to blame it on being accepted. You know, my family wasn't there for me, you know. That excuse. But I've also seen people that have had the greatest family, uhm, economy, ah, I mean, uhm, financial wise, everything. They've had good things but they still got jumped into the barrio. You know, it's based, ah, I think, you know, in my own opinion, what have I seen around me is that, it's you, you know. It's, yeah, it's pressure but, hey, if you're gonna say no, then, no, you know. They can't make you do it. And if they try to do it, you know, you still choose that, choose that path to stay in that area or just keep on doing the same thing you're doing, you know. That's the way I think about it. 

01:53:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM So part of, part of what I'm in, you know, hearing from that is regardless of the social circumstances in which you find yourself in, each of you makes a conscious choice to respond to your reality in the way that you think is, is, is appropriate. 

01:53:25
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA Exactly. For example, me, I'm, I mean, I didn't, I never lived in the city of Santa Ana, you know, I live here in Irvine which is, you know, upper class city, you know. And my parents are very wealthy. My mother went to college, you know, everything. Uhm, it doesn't matter, you know, I related to those people because that's who I, you know, related to, everybody. You know, I feel that society drove me towards that path. And that's the way I took and that's what I became, you know, a gang member. It has nothing to do with how much money you have, I mean, I see it here in Irvine. There's, I mean, how many gangs have I not seen try to come up in the city of Irvine, which is, you know, upper, upper-class, you know, wealthy people. 

01:54:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM And, and a predominantly white city. 

01:54:10
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA Exactly. You know, there's people that look up to that. They want that because they think that that's the way to go. Hey, you know, the world's gotta open their eyes and look and see that it doesn't matter what color you are. It doesn't matter how much money you have. It's, it's, ah, a world, you know, it, it's, it's a problem for the whole country, for the whole world, you know, because it's gonna keep on growing. And it doesn't matter. Nobody cares, you know. It doesn't, I mean, there's no actual guidelines to what, what kind of people join a gang. You know, it doesn't matter. 

01:54:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. (inaudible ). 

01:54:42
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA There's also a lot of other white kids, I mean, that are, you know, football players, you know, and doing other things. Still doing bad things, you know, but they're looking at us, like, it has a lot to do with racial, you know. 

01:54:55
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

01:54:55
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA It doesn't matter. That's what I'm trying to say. It doesn't matter, you know, ah, there's, there's bad things going on in the world and, you know, if you're gonna separate groups, then separate groups all the way. I mean, at school, try to separate groups and make everybody connect with each other. Not just all the football players here, and all the gang members over there. Because then, that's what pressures, you're into wanting to belong somewhere, you know, so. 

01:55:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES 'Coz that's a sense of fairness... (crosstalk) 

01:55:20
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA (inaudible). 

01:55:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES ...that happens in the schools. (crosstalk) 

01:55:20
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

01:55:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM And it sounds like two. (crosstalk) 

01:55:20
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA Because if you're not smart, you can't belong to the smart group.(laughs) You know what I mean? And if you're not a football player, then you can't be, belong with, go along with the, with the football players, you know. 

01:55:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM And it sounds like some of what you come to believe is what is possible in your life. It's really influenced by the messages you get from people early on that says, you either are, aren't this way or you belong to that group or don't belong to the other. 

01:55:45
JUAN SEBASTIAN FIGUEROA Exactly. 

01:55:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. 

01:55:45
JESSICA MONIGUE VALENCIA I think it all starts in sch, in early adolescent stages of school. If you teach them the right thing, then maybe they'll go the right path. Not, I'm not saying all of them are gonna listen. I'm saying, you know, it starts off at the younger age. 

01:56:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. 

01:56:00
JESSICA MONIGUE VALENCIA Once you're in high school, you know, you know, majority of those kids are, you know, go through in one ear, goes out the other. They don't listen to what you say if you go make a presentation. It starts off when you're younger, you need to start talking to them. Going out there and telling them, "Hey, you know what? If your family is not there for them, for you, I'm here for you. Here's my phone number." You know, and that triggered in my mind, once when they told me, "Hey, you know what? If nobody loves you, God loves you or I love you." You know, that triggered in my mind, "How's this person gonna love me if you don't even know me?" (crosstalk) 

01:56:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. 

01:56:35
JESSICA MONIGUE VALENCIA That gave me a lot of, you know, a lot of, a lot of things to think about. You know, you go out there and tell them, you know. At the time, they might, you know, just take your card and just blow it off. But later on, down the road, when they feel, you know, hey, nobody cares. Call this person up. See if it's really true. And that person's there for you. Hey, it's all right. And they start thinking like that, "Hey, this person is here for me. Why am I gonna need to get into that barrio? Why am I gonna need to go over here?" You know, and another thing is, that person needs to, they also need to start teaching them what they wanna do when they're older. 'Coz that always comes out to, you know, when they're 17, 16, 15, 16, 17 years old, and they don't have nothing they wanna do. (crosstalk) 

01:57:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM So sense of career direction... (crosstalk) 

01:57:20
JESSICA MONIGUE VALENCIA Oh! Yeah! (crosstalk) 

01:57:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. 

01:57:20
JESSICA MONIGUE VALENCIA Oh, wow! Well, let me get, jump into this gang and I don't have nothing else to do, you know. At that stage, they should know, you know, "Hey, I wanna be in the football team." "Well, go for it. You know." Don't let nobody tell you you can't do it. Just go for it and achieve that goal. That's all they need to do. 

01:57:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  Well, that was an interesting discussion that we've heard. And some very valuable lessons about the direction we might wanna go in. 

01:57:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. Absolutely. 

01:57:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Thom, Thomas, what do you think? About strategies and interventions? 

01:57:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM Well, I think that, that a couple of things come to mind. I think, both, ah, that are raised by the youth as well as things that we know that are going on, ah, here in our own community, ah, ah, in a quaisi nation. Uhm, one of the things is, how do we impact, I think, on, ah, I guess, problematic solutions to have other people get involved. Ah, I think one of the first things we wanna talk about is the whole notion of, of connecting up the triangle. 

01:58:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:58:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Ah, we talked about, ah, there's, there's, there's an old African proverb that says, "It takes a whole village to raise a child." And really we're trying to invite people to think about everybody needs to get involved in this process. How do we do that? Uhm, we've often talked about the idea that, I think, there's a triangle for success that exists. With home, with school, and community. That's the three di, dimensions. Ah, I think that the dimensions of the triangle still exist. The difficulty is that the triangle these days is not connected up. 

01:58:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uh hmm. 

01:58:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uhm, and, and each dimension is trying to develop a strategy in isolation of the other. Because each fundamentally disrespects what the other does and I see that happen a lot around the country. Home doesn't think school is doing a very good job. So, the strategy it develops is to try to keep their children in the home longer and away from school. School doesn't think home is doing a very good job. So the strategies that it develops are mutually exclusive and designed to keep the kids out of the home longer and out of the streets longer and in school. The community doesn't think either home or school is doing a good enough job and so the strategies they develop don't involve any collaboration with all three. And what's we're really trying to suggest as one strategy is that at the very base level, the community has to be involved with the school, with the home, in reconnecting back up that triangle. So that everybody is really on the same page. I think that's one, ah, issue that is, is absolutely paramount. 

01:59:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Well, I think you've begin to lay the foundation for strategy as we begin to see that it is a whole picture as opposed to just working with family or just working with school or just working with home. But I'd like to suggest that maybe there's another element. 

01:59:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay, uhm. (crosstalk) 

01:59:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES And that is the element of spirituality. (crosstalk) 

01:59:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yes. 

01:59:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES As we've been talking about. Namely, that there is a holistic sense where all this balance and harmony fits in. There is a sense of where we belong in this larger place that we call Earth. 

02:00:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yes. 

02:00:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  And that in that place, we find our connection with family, with community, and with home. 

02:00:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yes. Absolutely. Absolutely. Uhm, as we think about connecting up the triangle, I think we should invite our, ah, our viewers to consider, uhm, some of the solutions that are coming up with, ah, ah, you know, other entities around the county. One of the things I'm familiar with, for example, right here in our county, is what we are now calling the Eight Percent Solution. Ah, the Eight Percent Solution is a formula that was developed, ah, by Dr. Michael Schumacher, who was the Chief Probation Officer here in the County of Orange, ah, ah, California. And he engaged in a study that I think tracked first-time juvenile offenders. I think there were some, there was, well over 6,000, ah, youth over a three-year period, and then tracked them, ah, you know, into, ah, I think about five or six years into adulthood. And one of the things that's really interesting, of all the youth that they tracked, people who would come into the system, okay, 70 percent of them had no trouble in the first three-year period. Which is not bad. Ah, another, ah, I guess 22 percent had about one to two offenses or probation violation, right, so, some level of, of, of, ah, recidivism there. But what they found out, which is most interesting is that eight percent of those population became chronic offenders, and those eight percent committed between three and fourteen were crimes, were probation violations as juveniles. And those eight percent, in addition to those crimes, accounted for more than 50 percent of the repeat offenses that went on. (crosstalk) 

02:01:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Yeah. 

02:01:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM And so, one of the strategies we wanna take a look at is to invite you to consider, does that Eight Percent Solution really fit for your community? You might wanna think about engaging your study similar to, ah, ah, Dr. Schumacher, but also take a look at some of the characteristics that they were able to tease out of that particular, ah, ah, hardcore group, who represented that eight percent. Usually these youth were age 15. And younger at the time of the first offense. They came from disrupted families. We've certainly talked about that a lot today. (crosstalk) 

02:02:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Hmm. 

02:02:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM They had a history of poor performance in school. They had a history of drug and alcohol use, and also, in association with minors like themselves who were involved in trouble. (crosstalk) 

02:02:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  Hmm. 

02:02:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM And so, if you look at those particular characteristics, some of those, I think, began to spell danger signs for some of our youth. (crosstalk) 

02:02:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Yeah. 

02:02:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM And so, one of the things we wanna do as a solution is to maybe join forces with some of these screened agencies, or in this case, the probation department... (crosstalk) 

02:02:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Yeah. 

02:02:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM ...to see if we can provide, ah, both some information and data on tracking, as well as a way to, uhm, provide some positive influence on some of these youth who are a little bit more at risk than some of the others. 

02:03:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Hhmm. You know, that, ah, Eight Percent Solution reminds me of a piece of research, ah, on, uhm, the concept of the invulnerable child that I think... (crosstalk) 

02:03:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh-huh. Ah. 

02:03:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES ...is relevant to this... (crosstalk) 

02:03:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM Absolutely. Ah. 

02:03:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES  discussion. (crosstalk) 

02:03:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM Ah. 

02:03:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES And that is, uhm, the whole idea being that how are, how is it that some kids who are coming out of very dysfunctional families and, uhm, community settings where there is significant violence somehow able to come through and become heroes and, ah, professionals and, ah, very successful people. And I think, ah, sa, a couple of the ideas that have come from that research, I think, are significant for this discussion. 

02:03:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM Uh hmm. 

02:03:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES And the first is, ah, the idea that there, kids have a sense of personal control over their environment. 

02:03:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM Yes. 

02:03:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES In other words, that they're not necessarily tied into, ah, the, the craziness or the destruction or the violence, but somehow can begin to pull themselves out of it and see it for what it is. 

02:03:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM So, how do we help our kids to develop that greater level of mastery over their, their, their particular environmental, ah, ah, circumstance that they're in? 

02:04:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Yes. 

02:04:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. Okay. 

02:04:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES I think the second issue has to deal with, uhm, the, uhm, the, the presence of a charismatic person that is caretaking a particular child or adolescent, namely, a coach, a teacher... (crosstalk) 

02:04:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. 

02:04:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES ...uhm, a significant person who somehow is standing by this child or adolescent to be able to make it through the system. 

02:04:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

02:04:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES And, ah, I'm certain, all of us, uhm, have had that in our personal lives or even, uhm, in our families. What helped us get through either a barrier or a particular developmental phase, may have been an aunt, may have been an uncle, may have been, uhm, a sports coach. Uhm, so, I think that bit of, ah, information, I think, adds to your Eight Percent Solution idea that these are things that we can be doing right now. 

02:04:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM So, the presence of an additional significant other that can provide support, encouragement, nurturance during times of distress and, in, in our youth lives. 

02:05:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Yes. 

02:05:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. 

02:05:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES And there's one more, I think, that has to do... (crosstalk) 

02:05:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM Okay. 

02:05:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES ...well, with that whole idea of the invulnerable child, and that is that, uhm, the capacity to resist stress is particularly greatest among those children who don't get labeled. 

02:05:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM  Huh. Okay. 

02:05:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES Uhm, uhm, I remember a pha, ah, a phrase, ah, coined by, uhm, Bill Cosby, who said, "We're not poor. We're just temporarily out of money." 

02:05:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. (crosstalk) 

02:05:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES And so... (crosstalk) 

02:05:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM Hmm. (crosstalk) 

02:05:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES That begins to put it in a whole different context. And so, you know that if you carry a label as you're growing up, particularly, a negative label, you wear it. You start to believe it. You start to own it. And so, if, uhm, we are labeling our children in ways that are negative, whether in school or at home, eventually, that whole idea of who they are as people is gonna get played out in a broader society. 

02:05:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yes. Yes. Very much. 

02:05:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP So, I thought that was particularly keen on, uhm... (crosstalk) 

02:05:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

02:05:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  the ideas that you've been presenting. 

02:06:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yeah, I know. It fits real well. Ah, I wanna also look back and follow up because I think that if we're gonna really impact this, this triangle... (crosstalk) 

02:06:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:06:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...and we've talked some about the home and, and, and the community, but also wanna give some, some information and, and invite people to really who think about impacting some of our schools. 

02:06:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:06:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. We have got to think about making a difference for some of our youth as we think about teaching them a greater level of respect for just personhood, a greater level of respect across cultures, and some of that we have to provide and teach in the curriculum. Some of that we have to deal with some of the activities, which where kids learn an awful lot or don't learn, learn an awful lot as the case maybe about people who are culturally different. Because now, what we're starting to see is not only with in-group violence, which used to be kind of the bloods and the creeps or, you know, sick and seconds (ph) of the county(ph) or community, when all starting to see Black and Brown conflicts, White and Black conflicts, Black and Korean conflicts, ah, ah, Chicano-Asian conflicts. As people begin to, to disrespect each other's humanity... (crosstalk) 

02:07:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Hmm. 

02:07:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...out of the guys, have, have really, have distorted sense of who that other person is as a cultural human being. 

02:07:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:07:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. And that we've got to be able to, to resolve. And one of the ways to do that, in addition to the home, is really in trying to, ah, invite some of our school personnel...(crosstalk) 

02:07:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:07:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...to, ah, be involved in that as well. 

02:07:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  Uh hmm. Oh, I think that whole issue of violence amongst our children and adolescents, uhm, has transcended all ethnic group, as much as you're describing. 

02:07:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yes. 

02:07:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP And so, it particularly underscores the ideas that we're all in this together. 

02:07:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Hmm. As we take a look at some of these factors, we'd like to invite you now to, ah, turn off the tape and to discuss among yourselves what are the specific strategies that you can tailor for your particular community that might help you arrest this growing tide of violence. 

02:07:45
The following is a sample of programmatic initiatives. They are grouped according to the triangle of Home, School, and Community. HOME Parental Dispositions A. Expectation B. Accountability C. Discipline D. Nurturance/Love/Support E. Deliberate Indoctrination F. Involvement in Lives or our Youth (school, friends, etc.) SCHOOL Saturday Academies University of Virginia California State University, Fullerton CULTURALLY SPECIFIC SCHOOLS McClymonds High School, Oakland, California PROJECT YES Orange County Department of Education Infuse anti-gang and anti-drug messages into curriculum. Similar to that started by Massachusetts Department of Public Health in 1987 FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE Promotes events for youth with adult supervision that are free of drugs/alcohol/tobacco COMMUNITY "MAD DADS" Dads on streets after hours in Omaha, Nebraska Volunteers in Community Service Hospital in Bronx, New York COMMUNITY MINISTRY Churches reconnecting with youth Rev. Eugene Rivers in Boston, Mass. CLEVELAND WORKS BEAT THE STREETS PASSPORT TO THE FUTURE Rites of Passage/Mentorship/Apprenticeship Program Orange County, California 

02:07:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D.  We anticipate that many of you watching this videotape today are mental health professionals, are involved in, ah, providing counseling and supportive assistance to our youth. And so, we don't wanna leave today without really having a broader discussion about what is the role of counselors and other mental health professionals in really trying to impact this growing level of violence. Violence isn't something that we usually see, although sometime it gets diminished into, ah, a psychological issue, I mean, other than dealing with some of the emotional traumas associated with it. But let's begin to think some about what is the role of, ah, counselors in being able to arrest this growing increase of, of violence in our society? 

02:10:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. I've had a time to reflect on this particular area quite a bit in my practice and certainly in my teaching responsibilities at the university. And, uhm, as mental health professionals and as professional counselors, I feel like we've moved from a very individual-centered place in terms of our work, professional work, to that of more of a social systems approach to be able to understand and work with and provide effective strategies in working with, ah, this whole issue of violence. 

02:10:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

02:10:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP So, it feels to me like we have to move in that direction. 

02:10:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yes. Yes. Absolutely. Uhm, one of things, I think, that, that's important to, ah, to get across to our, our viewers today, and you and I talk about a lot as well, is that counseling as an activity, in the way that it's practiced in its traditional one-on-one format, I think will be insufficient to address the needs of our youth who are caught up in this cycle of violence. Well, I think that they clearly need to be doing something different. So, what do they do? One piece, I think, we wanna invite them to consider is they need to think about expanding that individual focus to one that is more holistic in recognizing all elements and attributing factors much like we have done... (crosstalk) 

02:11:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:11:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ..all today. As you look at, at factors that contribute to the rising violence, as you look at some of the root causes, there are implications and all of that for where counselors can begin to make, you know, serious interventions there. Uhm, again, we've talked about what can counselors do. Counselors are, are people who can help to connect up that triangle for success, that home, that school, that community, which I think is gonna be so, ah, valuable. Uhm, and particularly, e, e, even if you will think about the home, uhm, providing par, parenting advice, I think, is, is, is, is really important. Ah, providing support for people who are going through financial hardship, and some counseling, ah, you know, for that. Uhm, ah, teaching parents how to provide disciple for their children such that they have now been socialized in, in proper ways. Uhm, teaching families, and people, and youth to develop more effective communication styles, I think is another because a lot of our, our, our, our youth, ah, are caught up in that. Ah, teaching skills in conflict resolution. 

02:12:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:12:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. You know, I think is, is another. 

02:12:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:12:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uhm, I think in the school, counselors have a role to provide both, ah, emotional support for students in need, as well as consultation to administration and teachers around curriculum reform that can help students, ah, gain some of that information and correct some of that distortion of knowledge that they get, ah, out there in the, in the streets and, ah, and through the media. Uhm, I think also support groups for children, ah, both the ones who are able to resist aggression, as well as support groups for those children who have, ah, been either indirectly or directly impacted by the violence in their lives, I think, is another role for counselors to be able to play. Uhm, and I think that's particularly important. We've seen, ah, I think some excellent examples of that here in the, ah, Southern California, Los Angeles area, where we have, ah, a number of counselors, ah, ah, Lillian(ph) Duncan and, ah, Jesse(ph) Freeman, in fact, come to mind, where they've developed a support group for young primary school kids who have had their lives impacted by siblings, you know, brothers, somebody losing their lives, and how they then become to, to engage those kids and help them deal with that emotional trauma such that they can continue the, the process of learning. 

02:13:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:13:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. I think all that fits into, ah, into that role... (crosstalk) 

02:13:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:13:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ..as well. 

02:13:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP You're suggesting in several, ah, very potent interventions that I think, ah, are extremely useful for our audience and for us to be looking at as a, as a whole. 

02:13:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

02:13:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Ah, there are some areas also that I think, ah, tail on some of the things that you've been mentioning... (crosstalk) 

02:14:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Okay. 

02:14:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP ...that I might, uhm, go forward with those. 

02:14:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D.  Please. 

02:14:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uhm, some of those include to raise an awareness level about the interaction between the family and the community, ah, disintegration, the issue of alcohol and drug abuse, and the presence of weapons at the home. They are directly related into this whole issue of violence. Namely, it is not just a one-level sector situation, it is a multidimensional issue that we need to be looking at that all kinda play into each other. 

02:14:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

02:14:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Ah, I think second of all, is that we as counselors need to know our reference point. Uhm, as a provider, as a teacher, as an educator, ah, with respect to one's own biases and prejudices. 

02:14:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D.  Uh hmm. 

02:14:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP What place are we coming from in terms of looking at violence? Are we blaming a particular group? Uhm, are we blaming a family? Or, are we looking at it at a more dim, ah, multidimensional sense? I think that's important to know in terms of the place that we ourselves as, ah, providers are coming from. 

02:15:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

02:15:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP I think next is, uhm, as we begin to look at the issue of violence in a more holistic way, in a more va, in a more, uhm, uhm, view toward, ah, a societal, ah, makeup. And I think it, ah, we need to assess the level, and quality, and frequency of youth violence in a given community, as well as who's involved and the relevant age groups. Each community has its own blueprint for how it functions. And so, as a result, I think it is important for us to look at the specis, specificity of that particular community with respect to designing interventions. 

02:15:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yes. 

02:15:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  Uhm, I think it's also, as part of looking at that process, to look at the, there, finding relevant people in the community, ah, who have expertise and can demonstrate respecting, respectable and a healing presence. 

02:15:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yes. 

02:15:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Find them, utilize them, and help them be part of this process. 

02:15:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Absolutely. 

02:15:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Every community has a healing presence of folks. And I think it's important for us find who those folks are. (crosstalk) 

02:16:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. So attack into that, to that energy, to that spirit. 

02:16:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP That's it. 

02:16:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm, okay. 

02:16:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP I think next is to look at the missing elements, uhm, of community. There are not present for a variety of reasons. Maybe because funding has dried up or because maybe that's never been part of that history. Those elements that relate to the developing of integrity in family, to, to developing a bridge, building across ethnic and cultural groups, those that includes inside Boys & Girls Clubs, YMCAs, uhm, after-school programs. Are those existing in a particular community? And if so, how are they functioning? And if they're not, uhm, how would that be helpful in terms of implementing that in terms of helping kids to have a more holistic sense of who they are? 

02:16:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm. Now, I wanna, I wanna... (crosstalk) 

02:16:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Hmm. 

02:16:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...pick up on the community piece because that's real important 'coz as you know, that was one of our, you know, kinda dimensions of the triangle. And I think there's a, there's a real important role for, uhm, counselors to play there not only in, in getting involved as role models themselves. And certainly we can invite, ah, our counselors and other mental health professionals to do that. But, to invite them to develop, ah, and, and sponsor programmatic initiatives... (crosstalk) 

02:17:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Hmm. 

02:17:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...you know, that help to give you some of these things that they are, in fact, missing in the community. I think our counselors can play that role, for example, if they're missing recreational activities, if they're missing support groups, if they're missing whatever. We as the healers in the community... (crosstalk) 

02:17:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:17:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...as a psychologist, as the counselors can begin to provide some of that. 

02:17:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  Uh hmm. 

02:17:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uhm, and also, what comes to mind as I listen to you talk, while impacting community, I think we as counselors have a role to impact even the law enforcement community as well. 

02:17:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:17:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. And that, that collaboration, I think, is, is really a key, uhm, particularly when, not only can we help assisting them in, in some of their, ah, target interventions, but I'm always, ah, ah, ah, you know, curious about the, the way in which law enforcement is cast in the notion of crime prevention, yet most of the dollars that I see, ah, are really being relegated to what I call secondary and tertiary levels of intervention rather than primary ones. 

02:18:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:18:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. And so, we're looking at trying to, uhm, in providing more police officers on the street to provide patrol... (crosstalk) 

02:18:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:18:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...as well as providing more dollars for incarceration in prisons. 

02:18:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:18:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uhm, and, and I think, ah, in some cases, a strategy is necessary, but a, a bit misguided because it's hard to test some of these youth that we've been talking to, that, "We're gonna scare you. With three strikes, you're out." 

02:18:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Hmm. 

02:18:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. When these youth are feeling like they're willing to die tomorrow for a color or a neighborhood, or, you know, a group. 

02:18:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:18:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. You know... (crosstalk) 

02:18:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:18:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...living the rest of your life in jail is not gonna scare some of these youth. (crosstalk) 

02:18:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:18:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. We have to get them in before they get that kinda socialization. And so I think counselors have a role in being able to help law enforcement really expand... (crosstalk) 

02:18:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:18:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...on their perspective to try to get more primary intervention, strategies involved into law enforcement... (crosstalk) 

02:18:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:18:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...and some of the dollars really relegated to that, rather than just in secondary and tertiary levels. And I think that fits with the community thing you're talking about. 

02:18:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Yeah, and if I might add to that, uhm, if I look at law enforcement as part of a larger business community, uhm, that I think also as part of that intervention is to train professional and business people. (crosstalk) 

02:19:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm. 

02:19:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  Uhm, into an awareness of youth's problems and see, and help them understand their level of responsibility for that. 

02:19:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yes. 

02:19:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP So they can, ah, potentially have ways to influence the community in a broader sense. 

02:19:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh-huh. 

02:19:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uhm, I think as part of that also, uhm, is, uhm, to develop some, maybe, potential partnership between the business community and the neighborhood and local school, which again begins to tie in the, uhm, the triangle you that we've been talking about, ah, as a way of increasing the teaching and training of students... (crosstalk) 

02:19:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yes. 

02:19:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP ...as a way of job integration. 

02:19:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh-huh. 

02:19:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  Ah, as a way of beginning to share resources economically, socially, and business wise. Uhm, I think if we move from business community and kinda begin looking at, ah, schools, ah, you mentioned school, ah, importance, ah, the training of, ah, teachers, if I might add to that to provide an orientation, particularly, to kindergarten and elementary schools. 

02:20:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yes. (crosstalk) 

02:20:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Often times... (crosstalk) 

02:20:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Absolutely. 

02:20:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP ...we're doing that at the, ah, at junior high and high schools. 

02:20:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Absolutely. 

02:20:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Oftentimes, it's too late. And that orientation would be much of the things that you've already mentioned, peacemaking skills, conflict resolution skills, and so forth. 

02:20:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. All right. Those are, those are, those are particular key. 

02:20:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:20:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uhm, and it sounds like also, well, you've told me that, in terms of counselors getting on the community, one of the other strategies we wanna invite people to consider is a notion of the coun, the, the, the counselor or the psychologist, the mental health professional as a social engineer, as a social change agent, uhm, who tries to advocate for both political and economic reform. We've talked about, you know, the whole climate of, of poverty and how that impact on that. We've talked about, ah, the control and access to weapons and guns on our kids. That will also, those are political issues and economic issues that counselors can, you know, become, ah, ah, certainly advocates for, and become more of, ah, ah, social change agents to try to, to, to, ah, enlist their support and help to try to make a difference on some of those issues. Uhm, and also it sounds like you're, you, if I'm hearing you right, there's a prescription in there for saying that counselors can become trainers and group facilitators around violence prevention issues, particularly, around the issues of conflict resolution... (crosstalk) 

02:21:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:21:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...and, particularly, around the issues of, of, I think alcohol and substance use, which we know characterize a lot of the, ah, of violence, ah, ah, dimensions and statistics that we see. 

02:21:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:21:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm. 

02:21:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:21:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm. 

02:21:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP I've, ah, well, that leads me kinda to, ah, the whole issue of looking at the broader environment. 

02:21:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

02:21:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP And, uhm, if you'll look in your communities, you'll probably all know of places where you just don't wanna go by. 

02:21:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D.  Yes. 

02:21:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP And oftentimes, the way we handle that is simply just to leave those folks of that community alone. 

02:21:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

02:21:45
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP But yet oftentimes, that is the place where many of the violent actions may be happening. 

02:21:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yeah. 

02:21:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP And so, I think what, ah, I'm suggesting by that discussion is that we assess for the dangerous areas in the neighborhood and provide what, I guess, I, I think I would call a, ah, community crisis intervention, uhm, where we would provide that relief to war zone ar, communities as you mentioned. (crosstalk) 

02:22:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

02:22:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  Ah, where we, ah, begin to distinguish in part because, ah, oftentimes we tend to see everything in terms of individual pathology or... (crosstalk) 

02:22:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yes. 

02:22:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP ...individual problems. I think it's important also, when you look at war zone communities, that you begin distinguishing between individual pathology, relational conflict, or acculturation stress. 

02:22:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yes. 

02:22:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  Particularly, when you have, ah, a multi-ethnic communities moving into a place where there's significant misunderstanding. 

02:22:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yes. 

02:22:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uhm, and lastly, that you help established some safety contract with the community as part of esta, ah, setting up this, ah, quote, "war zone area," uhm, and to be a more safe place. So, folks, again, come back to that, ah, concept of the invulnerable child, and people have a sense of, ah, predictability and control over the place in which they live. 

02:22:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Certainly, we've seen even some of the community groups. I think both of us are aware of the, ah, group out of, ah, the Greater Nebraska area, I think, ah, Omaha, and, and maybe even Lincoln, where they have chapters or groups called Mad Dads... (crosstalk) 

02:23:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Hmm. 

02:23:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...who have actually gone out into the communities... (crosstalk) 

02:23:10
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Hmm. 

02:23:10
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D.  To kinda take back to streets and kinda patrol those streets to make sure that their environments and immediate communities are really safe. That certainly is a, is a level of empowerment... (crosstalk) 

02:23:20
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:23:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...that they have given themselves, that is, in fact, making a, ah, a big difference there. 

02:23:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:23:25
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yeah. 

02:23:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Well, we've had a chance to talk about lots of interventions. Uhm, it feels to me like, uhm, there is room now for us to take, begin with responsibility for, now doing something about it. 

02:23:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Yeah. Certainly, we've tried to present to you as the, as the, the viewing audience with, ah, a set of challenges, uhm, and, ah, in, in summary, I guess, what are we saying? We wanna invite our viewers, to first of all, challenge themselves to believe that they can make a difference. And so, you have to be able to develop that sense of personal mastery of yourself, much like, ah, ah, Jose and I had been talking about, and to understand that it takes hard work. It takes a patient spirit. It takes a level of perseverance that will test the very, ah, ah, fiber of your being. It will test your absolute last nerve, but you've gotta have patience and believe that you can make a difference. Well, secondly, it sounds like we're saying that, that we need to develop more, ah, intervention strategies that are more holistic rather than single-focused. 

02:24:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  Yes. 

02:24:20
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uhm, and so, we've gotta attempt to kinda reconnect up the triangle as we've talked about home, school, community. Ah, we've gotta begin to seek more role models. We've gotta begin to, ah, help our kids develop more non-violent alternatives. To that certainty, some of the educational programs, ah, that existing, you know, Black Scholars programs, ah, via the 100 Black Men Organization, ah, the Passport to the Future Program that, that, that, that they're also running down on Orange County are examples of that. All schools who teach violence prevention curriculum, in the certainties, another of example of that communities who get involve by providing positive, constructive, ah, programmatic alternatives for you. Particularly, in the business community, I think, as you mentioned, is another. 

02:24:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Hmm. 

02:24:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Ah, third, we're really suggesting that, that people need to consider indoctrinating our youth with different value systems, particularly our culturally-different youth. Because I think, I believe very, very strongly that much of the problem in our streets, as a result of our youth anchoring themselves in a value system, in a world view that is foreign to their own sense of, of cultural integrity. 

02:25:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh-huh. 

02:25:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. And I think we've gotta begin to, to, ah, straighten that out. Ah, we've also talked about the idea of being able to work in concert with local law enforcement and to support them in their efforts as well. But also, while we support them, to not allow their efforts to be too exclusively focused on arrest and incarceration rather than other primary prevention programs that they can get involved in. 

02:25:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:25:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. And some of the, the, what law enforcement does is, is very good in their effort, but certainly we can do, ah, we can do more. Uhm, in, in the family piece, we're really talking about inviting people to develop a greater level or helping families really develop a greater level of accountability with their children, particularly with our young boys. 

02:25:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:25:55
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Because I think the level of accountability we have with our young girls versus our young boys in a lot of our communities is very, very different... (crosstalk) 

02:26:00
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:26:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. And, we've got to really, you know, begin on that. Ah, clearly, we've talked about more activities to address systemic factors that contribute to violence like poverty, like drug and alcohol use, like the availability of guns, like the family disintegration. And we, as counselors and mental health professionals, really have to be challenged to take a look at that. Uhm, another challenge, I think, as you mentioned, ah, also, Jose, is the need to confront our own biases regarding who the victims and the perpetrators are and how that impacts our ability to in, get involve as to instigate change. 

02:26:30
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:26:30
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. You know, and so, confronting our own biases, I think, as a mental health professional is important. Uhm, and lastly, I think we, we were talking about, uhm, how to engage in efforts where each of us help to create a society that is more nurturing and supportive than the one that we currently have. 

02:26:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Uh hmm. 

02:26:50
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Uhm, ah, I always believe that if you plant the seeds of, of kinda racial harmony, you'll reap the fruits of social justice. 

02:26:55
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP  Right. (crosstalk) 

02:27:00
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. But, if, if, if you plant the fields of, of ethnic scapegoating and racial devices in this, that we have going on around our, our, ah, country now, what you'll harvest really are the bitter fruits of resentment, frustration, hopelessness, and despair, which many of our youth display. Indeed, we can see them on the faces of, of many of the youth... (crosstalk) 

02:27:15
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Hmm. 

02:27:15
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. ...that we see. Ah, people were really clear with those, a couple years ago with some of the unrest. Without justice, there will be no peace. And I think our youth has sent a loud and clear signal about that. 

02:27:25
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP You speak the wisdom of, uhm, a, a, uhm, piece of information that I've heard before. And, uhm, if I might read that, this, ah, particular piece of wisdom also, which complements very much what you've been saying was written a hundred years ago... (crosstalk) 

02:27:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm. 

02:27:40
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP By Chief Seattle, a, ah, well-respected Native American healer and, ah, chief. 

02:27:45
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D.  Let's share that with our, with our group. 

02:27:50
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP "Teach your children what we have taught our children, that the earth is our mother. Whatever befalls the earth, befalls the sons and daughters of the earth. If men spit upon the ground, they spit upon themselves." 

02:28:05
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm. 

02:28:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP "This we know. The earth does not belong to us. We belong to the earth. This we know. All things are connected like the blood, which unites one family. All things are connected. Whatever befalls the earth, befalls the sons and daughters of the earth. We did not weave, weave the web of life. We are merely a strand in it. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves." 

02:28:35
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. Hmm. 

02:28:35
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP So, I feel that wisdom speaks much of the kinds of things that you've been summarizing in our discussion. 

02:28:40
THOMAS A. PARHAM, PH.D. How profound. How profound. As we close, it's been our pleasure to present to you some information on expanding our perspective on youth violence. And hopefully, we've had the chance to take a look at both expanding that perspective, examining some of the, ah, ah, issues that contribute to the rise in violence, ah, really dialoguing about some of the root causes, and taking a look at some of the solutions and interventions and the role that counselors and mental health professionals can play in trying to, ah, arrest the growing tide of violence that is really plaguing in our communities all across this nation. It's been my pleasure to welcome a colleague and friend, Dr. Jose Cervantes. And I've enjoyed, ah, having you, ah, as part of the tape. And we also wanna provide a thank you to our guest, both to, ah, the couple, ah, to our panel of experts, and to the kids who gave us just some very valuable information that hopefully you'll find equally valuable. Uhm, in part, in closing, we wanna say, "You can make a difference." An opportunity, ladies and gentlemen, is a threat. An opportunity to make a difference is a threat to those of you who predict failure. But it's a challenge to those of you think you just might win. If you think we can at this issue of violence, then let us stand collectively together and see if we can make a difference in the lives of our youth. For Jose Cervantes, I'm Dr. Thomas Parham. We'd like to say, "Thank you." 

02:30:05
JOSEPH M. CERVANTES, PH.D., ABPP Thank you.
