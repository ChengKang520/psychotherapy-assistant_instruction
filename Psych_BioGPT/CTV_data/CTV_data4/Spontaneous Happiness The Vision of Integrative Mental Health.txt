RICH SIMON Okay. So, uh, over the last three decades, the mental health field, as many of us know, has been dominated with, by what Networker writers John Arden and Lloyd Linford called "Pax Medica," a world view in which mental and emotional problems are seen to be biomedical diseases with distinct pathologies, all neatly categorized. And, so, the bible of psychotherapy, the DSM, and increasingly treated with meds, meds, meds. And as we're all now learning from new research or, more accurately, from the release of previously unpublished research, many of these strutting emperors, particularly the blockbuster antidepressants, are naked as Jaybirds. Studies now show they often don't work any better than placebo, in some cases, not (inaudible ). And, in addition, meds-based psychiatry, like all high-tech, fancy-pants medical interventions of our day almost always completely overlook the factors undermining health and well-being: poor diet, no exercise, excessive drinking, poverty, loneliness, loneliness, lack of spiritual resources. By now, we're used to hearing critiques of big pharma and the dehumanizing, uh, modern-day health care, but what's more encouraging is that the words, 'holistic health care' and, more recently, 'integrative medicine' have become part of our, uh, common vocabulary. In fact, even the polysyllabic term 'biopsychosocial spiritual model', it may not dance trippingly off of anybody's tongue, but still, anybody who thinks about how to reform our physical and mental health system, make it generally about healing people and keeping them well, nods when they hear it. Over the last two decades, this, the, our speaker this morning has probably had more of an impact on bringing about those changes than anyone I can think of. Uh, in, not only is, but, not that he is always beloved by everybody, while he does have the kind of visionary imagination that has inspired millions of people, he also has a good store of sheer chutzpah that has enraged the usual suspects from the medical establishment. Especially enraging to them has been the fact there are now 42 academic medical centers offering integrative medical programs, including the Mayo Clinic, Harvard Mental Health, Mental School, uh, Medical School, Georgetown, Duke, and Columbia Universities. You could say that Andrew Weil has been on a quest to radically reform healthcare in America for close to 50 years, even before he quite knew it himself. He seems to have something of that in mind in 1964, when he told the admissions committee at Harvard Medical School that he didn't want to be a doctor, but he wanted a medical education anyway because it would help him better understand the relationship between mind and body and how the mind affected the body. That kind of interview, and at Harvard, no less, could only happen in the 1960s. Imagine trying to get into any self-respecting medical school today with that line. You do wonder, though, if his teachers at Harvard realize what they were getting when they let Andrew in, and I suspect, by the time he was in his final year of medical school, there must have been a few senior faculty members who thought it had been a terrible mistake. That was the year that Andrew devoted his entire senior elective time to researching marijuana. He'd already done an undergraduate thesis on the pharmacological effects of nutmeg, though, he admitted that ingesting large quantities of, of it was, in his words, not very pleasant. His work on drugs was a kind of paradigm for the way Andrew would approach healthcare and healing, right up to the moment. That is, in his research and study, he would take an honest, fearless look at human reality as it is and put aside conventional assumptions and receive wisdom, not to mention, establish authority. Or, if they did not reflect, especially, did they reflect and reveal real-life human experience. The actual lesson he took away from all this work on drugs was, in fact, not that it's a great idea to get high on drugs and stay high all the time, his was not Timothy Leary's message, at all; his research and personal experimentation taught him that was indeed, in all of us, an inborn, innate, human drive to change consciousness, to alter our own inner experience. But artificial drugs weren't, in the end, a very good way to do it. As he wrote, "the disadvantage of drugs is that when they wear off, you haven't learned anything. They don't teach you how to do it the next time." That, this insight, 'drugs don't do much, do much to the mind,' uh, it, uh, something, something to the mind, has enabled the mind to do something for itself; something that it already has the potential to do would be the key to his developing philosophy of healthcare. As he put it, puts it, "healing comes from within. We're born with a healing system, with the capacity for self-repair, regeneration, and that the business of medicine is to facilitate that process." One reason that Andrew Weil's work has appealed to so many people for so long is that he makes so much ordinary common sense. He is not a crusader against scientific message, medicine, as he's often portrayed; far from it. But, he recognizes that, for all its vast power, money, and institutional resources, the model, biomedical model is not the whole story. Only one, perhaps, a chapter, in a much larger, much more complex story. Now, in his latest book, 'Spontaneous Happiness' he has set his sights on our field and used his remarkable gifts as a systematic thinker and synthesizer to reflect back to us a view of our role that he refers to as 'integrative mental health.' He's here this morning, not only to share this vision with us, but for those of us who still like their visionaries to be cut from the traditional mold to have at least one speaker up on this stage who bears some resemblance to an Old Testament Prophet. It is my great pleasure to introduce to you, this morning, the prophetic Andrew Weil.

ANDREW WEIL Thank you. Uh, I would say that Rich Simon and his fellow performers define the phrase 'a hard act to follow'. Uh, good morning, it is a pleasure to be here. I'll tell you one quick story. When, uh, I had forgotten all that about the Harvard Medical School admissions committee. The, the greatest compliment paid to me by someone from Harvard Medical School was a few years ago, I was asked to present a, a Lifetime Achievement Award to doctor, the late Dr. Judah Foldman, who's the father of anti-angiogenesis, uh, research on cancer, a very distinguished scientist, and when I gave him the award, he said to me, "you know, we always said, at Harvard Medical School, that we liked to train students to think for themselves, and now that one of them has, they don't like it at all." So, I want to tell you, today, about integrative medicine and integrative mental health, which are great passions of mine. Exactly two years ago, the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine, uh, sponsored the first national conference on integrative mental health in Phoenix, at the Arizona Biltmore. Uh, we invited, I think, the leading researchers from a great diversity of fields; uh, a, a leading psychopharmacologist, the leading researchers in, in, uh, the new brain neuroscience, Buddhist psychologists, uh, experts on nutritional medicine. It was a great conference, and this was, uh, targeted for an audience of 300 psychiatrists, psychologists, uh, social workers, counselors, and others. Uh, we had to close the registration at 700, which was all our venue could accommodate. If we'd had a bigger venue, we could have had, I think, an infinite number of participants. The hunger in this group for hearing about a new model of mental health and a new way of doing things was palpable, and people said they'd been waiting years to hear this kind of information. So, we're trying to build on that. About the same time, I found out, to my surprise, that the great, the most frequent question coming in to my website, drweil.com, was about depression. And then, I began looking at some of the statistics on the uses of, uh, psychopharmaceuticals in our country, and was very shocked. Uh, at that time, the statistics were that one in ten Americans, it may be, now, one in nine, is on a prescribed antidepressant drug, the Wall Street Journal last December said that one in four in Americans is now on psychiatric medication at one point or another; and that's just shocking. And it really, I think, demands an explanation. Where is all this coming from? We have more mental health professionals offering more mental health services than ever in history, and, by all accounts, uh, mental and emotional health are worse than they've been in our population. What is wrong with this picture? Um, clearly, some of the depression epidemic is manufactured by the pharmaceutical medical complex, which has been very effective at convincing people that ordinary states of sadness are matters of imbalanced brain chemistry that require treatment with drugs. And, by the way, I hope all of you will work, and I tell this to every audience I speak to, to end the practice of direct consumer advertising of pharmaceutical drugs.

ANDREW WEIL There's only one other country in the world that allows that, New Zealand, that was slipped in, somehow, without anyone noticing, during the Clinton Administration, and it can be stopped if enough of you write your legislators and tell them that you want to end this practice. It's been a disaster for medical practice and an unbelievable boom for the pharmeceutical companies. So, I don't know what that percentage is, and maybe it's as much as a quarter or a third of the depression epidemic that is spurious, in this way. If we take that away, we're still left with an awful lot of depression to explain. I, I frequently ask people, just, people of all sorts, 'why do you think people are so depressed today?' A common answer that I get is, 'well, look at the economy,' or, 'look at the state of the world.' But, my parents lived through the Great Depression, which makes this look pretty tame, and they lived through World War II, which is the most horrific human experience on record, and by all accounts, mental and emotional health are much better in our population than, than now. So, what's happened? What's changed? One, uh, clue is that in the few hunter-gatherer societies left on the planet today, depression is unknown; you can't find a case of major depression in Papua New Guinea. So, what are those people doing different from us? Everything. You know, they are not disconnected from nature, uh, they're eating real food, not industrial food-like substances, uh, they're getting plenty of physical activity, uh, they're not subject to the kind of information overload and media stimulation that we are today, and, I think, especially important, they enjoy the protection of strong tribal and community support. Um, I would say one of the changes I can observe in my lifetime, in this culture, is increasing social isolation for all sorts of reasons. Um, you know, one of the examples I used in 'Spontaneous Happiness' which, which I find interesting, I grew up in a roadhouse in Philadelphia in the late 1940s, 1950s, and my memories are that before air conditioning, on hot summer nights, the whole block was out on the front steps, kids playing stick-ball on the street; it was a great opportunity for social interaction and community. Uh, when we got our first air conditioner, it was possible to stay indoors, and we congratulated ourselves on being modern and advanced. And, I think, in a way, that's representative of how technological innovations and affluence, which we think are so great, have made it easier and easier for us to live in insulated cocoons. Uh, now that we can have our media centers in those cocoons as well, there's little reason to go out, and it's more and more possible to interact with people virtually than it is in reality, not to mention all the fear that's been created, uh, about letting kids outside and so forth. I, another of my memories, both my parents worked in downtown Philadelphia, and from a very early age, I don't know, nine, seven, uh, I took commuter trains and public transportation and subways to downtown Philadelphia, walked around the streets of Center City by myself. Nobody ever thought anything of that. I mean, look how things have changed today. At any rate, there's very clear research that, that social interaction, connectiveness, strongly protects emotional and mental health, and that clearly has deteriorated in our society. So, I would say, in a nutshell, the depression epidemic and the anxiety disorders that are so closely related to it, represent a mis-match between the life that our genes have prepared us for and the life that we now actually live. And it's all of these factors together; it's the disconnection from nature, information overload, lack of physical activity, uh, the diet, which I will have some words to say about, and the, an increasing social isolation. I think all of this leave us vulnerable to what we're seeing today. Now, in integrative medicine, I mean, the, the basic, first of all, let me just say integrative medicine is not alternative medicine, and when I talk to medical audiences, especially, I have to ask people to make that distinction. Um, integrative medicine has much larger goals than simply bringing, um, other therapies in, into, giving, giving doctors other tools to use. Uh, the broad aims of integrative medicine are first, to restore the focus of medicine on health and healing, and to emphasize that the body has innate healing capacity, innate healing mechanisms, and that's where good medicine should start. Um, secondly, that people are more than physical bodies; we are mental, emotional beings, spiritual entities, community members, and those other dimensions of human life have to be taken into account in understanding the causes of illness, in the causes of health, and ways of intervening when there is disease. Uh, integrative medicine places a great emphasis on lifestyle. Lifestyle medicine is one of our major areas, and I think that puts us in a much stronger position than conventional medicine to practice real prevention and health promotion. Um, and we also, and this resonates with what Rich Simon said, place a great deal of emphasis on the practitioner-patient relationship, which we see as central to the healing process. And that, of course, has also deteriorated terribly in the age of for-profit medicine, where there's so little time available for medical interactions. And then, finally, we're willing to look at all therapies that may be useful, wherever they come from, as long as they're not going to hurt people and show reasonable evidence of, of efficacy. In the, in medicine in general, but, I think, in the mental health field, particularly, the influence of the biomedical model, which is all dominant, has been stifling. I think it, it greatly limits our ability to understand health and illness and it greatly limits the possibilities of intervention. But, in the mental health field, particularly, I think this stifling influences is (inaudible ), and that was one of the motivations for holding this conference on integrative mental health. And let me just say some, some words about, I, I don't want to spend the whole time talking to you about the drugs that have become so popular, but just let me, um, you know, give you just some of the opinions I have on it. Clearly, brain biochemistry is a factor in our well-being, but it's not the only factor and I think the, one of the most, uh, to me, limiting, um, paradigms within the broader biomedical model is materialism, that is, the philosophy that the, that the only thing that's real and important is that which is physical, which can be measured, touched, and, I guess, I medicine, removed. And the, uh, the materialistic paradigm, its dogma is that if you observe a change in a physical system, the cause has to be physical. It cannot allow for non-physical causation of physical events. The whole, I think the, the most dramatic challenge to this is coming out of the new neuroscience inspired by the Dalai Lama and, uh, Buddhist practitioners who are working with Wester neuroscientists, who are demonstrating, using the most high-tech, cutting-edge methods, that the ways we think and use the mind can actually change the function and, ultimately, the structure of the brain. I mean, that is an enormous challenge to the biomedical model, and I think it really hasn't totally sunk in yet. Now, the, the, the, in mental health, the prevailing biomedical explanation of depression is that it represents deficiency of serotonin in the brain. And, so, the aim is all about boosting serotonin. There is a drug currently being marketed in the U.K., it's called Tianeptine, or, the brand name, Coaxil, which has been shown to be an effective antidepressant; it lowers brain serotonin levels. You can't have it both ways, you know, something's, something's not right, there. In addition, as Rich Simon said, there was a growing body of very disturbing, uh, scientific literature, showing that the SSRIs, in most cases, work no better than placebos. When this information started to come out, the people who were very dedicated to using these drugs retreated to the position that, 'well, maybe that's true in mild to moderate depression, but it's certainly not true in severe depression.' Now, even in severe depression, we can't show a difference between placebos and SSRIs, and it looks as if only in very, very severe depression, which is a very small percentage of cases, can you demonstrate a difference. So, that doesn't look so good, and that is not, that makes the whole serotonin hypothesis of depression look fairly shaky. That's not to mention all the toxicity that these drugs cause and, but, to me, there's an even worse problem that has only recently been noted, and this something you should all read up on; there's a phenomenon called Tardive Dysphoria that has recently been reported in the medical literature, and that's a fancy terms for lingering bad mood, caused by the drugs. And the explanation of this is it's so consistent with everything that I know about healing and about physiology, one of the most basic principals, and I learned this in my physiology course in my first year of medical school, I was very disturbed a few years ago to learn that physiology is no longer being taught as a separate course in medical school; it's been broken up and put into, distributed in other subjects. Physiology is where I learned the most important principles of the innate healing mechanisms of the human body. One of those mechanisms is homeostasis. This is a basic principle. Living organisms try to maintain equilibrium, and if they encounter disturbing outside forces, they react against them in order to stay in the same place, that's what homeostasis means. Now, in medicine, we rely, almost exclusively, on very strong counteractive drugs to treat everything. Now, the body is out of balance and we push it back toward the center point with a strong counteractive force. That kind of treatment may be necessary, even essential, if the body is very out of balance; you want to get it quickly back to a, a near-normal state. But, once you do that, I think it's very important to back off of those methods and find other ways of keeping things in balance because if you don't, if you keep applying that external counteractive force, you run into the body's reaction, the homeostatic reaction, against it, which may get you into worse trouble. This is exactly the situation that we have today with the widespread use of these acid-suppressive drugs, that are given out like candy, for the management of reflux disease. These drugs were never intended to be used for long-term; they were originally prescription drugs, now you can get them over counter, this is Nexium and Prilosec and, you know, all that kind of stuff. They have very significant dangers associated with them: they increase risks of osteoporosis, stomach cancer, they block absorption of nutrients, uh, they, and nobody talks about this, but stomach acid is your chief defense against infection coming in by the oral route. So, with lots of people walking around with no stomach acid, this is greatly encouraging the, uh, the development and spread, in our population, of very nasty G.I. bugs. Um, but the worst problem is that if you take these drugs for any period of time, you can't get off them because if you try to get off them, there's an incredible rebound production of acid, worse than you had to begin with. The New England Journal of Medicine published a study a couple of years ago, uh, showing that if you take young men, healthy, who have no G.I. problems and put them on one of these drugs for four weeks, then stop it suddenly, they will get reflux. The same phenomenon has now been observed with the SSRIs; if you give a drug, that increases serotonin at neural junctions in the brain, over a period of time, what is the body going to do? It makes less serotonin and it drops serotonin receptors. And those changes don't reverse quickly when you stop the drug, so you're left with a situation that the drug creates its own need, and that the wide-spread use of these may actually be prolonging depression. Now, we were always taught, I remember in medical school, that depression was self-limited. It could be disabling, but it tends to be self-limited. We don't see that so much anymore, and that may be a direct result of, of the wide-spread use of the SSRIs in our population. So, something to think about. And, by the way, one of the, uh, as I said, this is not just in the mental health field, it's everywhere in medicine and it's one of the things that we try to teach the physicians and nurse practitioners and medical students and residents who come to our center for training. One of the, uh, assignments that I like to give people is to look at the PVR(ph), uh, you know, which everyone thinks is a, just a, an objective compilation of information about drugs; as you know, it's the pharmaceutical industry's publication. There's a section at the beginning, uh, in blue, where drugs are listed by category, and the categories are in bold-faced type, and then under them are all the, the individual drugs. It's very instructive to run your finger down these pages and just note how many of the category headings begin with the prefix 'anti'. Now, this is the nature of our medicine; it's antihypertensives and anticholinergis and anti this and anti that and antidepressants. And this is a general problem with this kind of counteractive medicine, that you get the homeostatic reaction of the body, which not only makes you dependent on the drugs, but may prolong of worsen the condition for which you originally gave them. There is, by the way, an, an alternative hypothesis of depression that I came across when I was doing research for 'Spontaneous Happiness' that I found very fascinating, and that, because I am tremendously interested in dietary influences on health, and I just want to tell you this story. Farmers have long known that when domestic animals get sick, usually with infectious illnesses, they show a characteristic pattern of behavioral changes that, collectively, are called 'sickness behavior' and these include loss of appetite, uh, loss of interest in socializing with others of their kind, immobility, and loss of interest in sex; changes that are strikingly similar to those in humans with major depression. Now, farmers have long attributed sickness behavior to fatigue associated with illness, but in the 1950s, it was found that sickness behavior was mediated by a blood-borne factor, that is, you can take blood from an animal with this behavior, inject it into a healthy animal, and the healthy animal shows the same behavioral changes. So, no one really knew what this was, it was called 'factor X' for a long time. In the 1970s, it was identified as a group of regulatory compounds called Cytokines, that are used by the immune system to control inflammation and are a major part of our body's defenses against infection. Uh, shortly afterwards, some of the Cytokines became purified and available for medical use as treatments. The first one was interferon, which became available as a treatment for chronic hepatitis, and then some of the interleukins became available for cancer treatment. If you look at the package inserts on these drugs, the warnings are about severe depression and greatly increased risk of suicide. Uh, this has led to the Cytokine hypothesis of depression, which I find very appealing, and this states that there is a correlation between an up-regulation of inflammation in the body (inaudible ) by Cytokines and depression. If you think about it, this makes, this is an adaptive response because if the organism is dealing with an, a serious infection, it is useful to have it stop eating and stop moving and not waste energy so that energy can be conserved to help the immune system fight the infection. So, the fact is that these pro-inflammatory immune substances affect the brain in ways that produce behavioral changes that are useful. But, in some kinds of illnesses, this kind, this response, becomes exaggerated or never ends, and that's particularly seen in, in autoimmune diseases and also in cancer. And I, I think this is a very reasonable explanation for why we see a, such a strong association between depression and cancer. Uh, I think it is, it is often not simply a reaction of a person to having an awful disease, it is, in fact, a symptom of the disease. Uh, and the reason that I find this very appealing is that it fits in with other work that I've been doing in, on inflammation, in general, as being the root cause of most, the most serious chronic, degenerative diseases. For years, I've been recommending an anti-inflammatory diet and an anti-inflammatory lifestyle as the best ways of reducing overall risk of disease (cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease), as well as maximizing longevity and extending optimum health for as long as possible. Um, there are many influences on inflammation. Uh, by, by the way, I assume you all know inflammation is, is the cornerstone of the body's healing response; that's how the body gets more nourishment and more immune activity to an area that needs it. But inflammation is so potentially destructive that it's very important that it stay where it's supposed to stay and end when it's supposed to end. If if persists, if it serves no purpose, then it becomes productive of disease, and clearly, now, uh, cardiovascular disease begins as inflammation in arteries, Alzheimer's disease begins as inflammation in the brain, cancer is totally linked to your (inaudible ), anything that increases inflammation in the body also stimulates cells to divide more frequently. Uh, and now, it looks as if depression may be another manifestation of inappropriate inflammation in the body, and this suggests other ways of, of approaching it, both for treatment and prevention. Already, in the past year, several papers have suggested trials of anti-inflammatory drugs as novel treatments for major depression and the preliminary data looked good, so far. So, I, I, I think this is just fascinating, and clearly, the mainstream diet in this population is strongly pro-inflammatory; it's, but, both because of what it gives you, the wrong kinds of fats and the wrong kinds of carbohydrates, and what it doesn't give you, which is all the protective elements that, in food, that, that contain inflammation and protect the body against inflammatory damage. So, I see this as a, as a broader, much more interesting way of looking at depression than simply as a matter of, of serotonin deficiency at neural junctions. Again, not to say that's not important, but it's one factor. Of the, uh, on the physical level, the strongest scientific evidence that we have for ways to protect against depression and to treat it are first for physical, physical activity, and second, for supplemental fish oil. Uh, overwhelming scientific evidence for both of these interventions. I don't think I need to say much to you about physical activity, you saw a great example of it up here, however, I will say that the research that's been done on this suggests that moderate regular physical activity may be more effective than intensive physical activity. Uh, the intervention that has been most frequently studied is walking, um, and I think this is good news for people. I mean, it doesn't mean you have to go to gyms or work with trainers or run marathons; you want to move your body every day, and you want to keep active throughout life, and that seems to be a strikingly effective measure and it should be recommended to everyone. And that seems, to me, inexcusable that, in any mental health encounter, this is not discussed, that activity levels are not looked at and that recommendations are not given for how to improve that. With regard to, uh, fish oil, the, again, overwhelming scientific evidence for this, and I'll just tell you one, uh, one story. A, uh, a graduate of our, uh, fellowship, uh, Daphne Miller, uh, family medicine practitioner in the Bay Area, several years ago wrote a, a very good book about, uh, nutrition and health called 'The Jungle Effect'. And she traveled around the world and looked at correlations between traditional diets and diseases, and she looked especially for what she called hot and cold spots in the world where diseases were either particularly prevalent or particularly low in frequency, and, uh, to see what the dietary correlations were. Do you know what the country in the world is with the lowest incidence of depression, by far? And it's very surprising; it's Iceland. You know, how do they get away with that, up there in the cold and dark? You know, they do it because they have the highest tissue levels of omega-3 fatty acids of any people in the world, and they get that by, not only eating a great many, uh, oily fish, but they eat roasted sea birds that have feasted on oil fish, the dairy products they eat come from animals that graze on lichens and other, uh, high-latitude plants that have omega-3 fatty acids in them. So, they're stuffing themselves with omega-3s, and that's fascinating. Uh, there is no downside to taking omega, fish oil supplements, except to the fish, and that's a great concern. Uh, I am hoping that one day soon we'll have algae-based supplements that provide DHA and EPA. There's some on the market, uh, now, but I think we can do better, but that would be great because not only would that make these acceptable to vegetarians, but it would spare dwindling populations of fish in the ocean. There is no downside to this kind of supplementation, nor is there any upper limit; the more you take, the better. Now, I've recommended 20 grams a day to people with bipolar disorder, people have given 40 grams a day, I mean, I suppose you burp up a lot of fish, fishy taste when you do that, but, really, the more you get into you, the better. I mean, these are absolutely necessary for optimum brain function. And, and, by the way, one of the, uh, the, a new hypothesis about postpartum depression is that it may result from, um, a temporary deficiency of omega-3s because the fetal brain, especially in the last trimester, has such a need for DHA that if there's not enough in the mother's diet, it will rob the mother's brain of DHA, and then leaving her with a relative deficiency, uh, after birth. So, this is a very useful thing to remember, and one other thing on the physical level: it's very important to get vitamin D levels checked on all patients. Uh, and it doesn't matter where you live in the country, vitamin D deficiency is as common in Southern Arizona, where I live, uh, as it is here, in Washington D.C. because dermatologists have made people so paranoid about the sun, um, that everybody uses sunscreen, which blocks vitamin D synthesis. Sun is good for you. It's also bad for you, so you need to find the right balance, and mostly, it's being aware of the angle of the sun in the sky, but moderate, sensible sun exposure is a good thing. Um, it's, by the way, also the best way to get vitamin D because it increases the number of vitamin D receptors in the skin that you tend to lose as you age, where taking supplements doesn't do that. Uh, nonetheless, I recommend everybody take 2,000 IU of vitamin D a day, but get blood levels checked because if they're very low, you may need much more than that for a short period to get them up. Vitamin D, as I'm sure you're aware, now, has a lot more to do, uh, than, than bone health; it's, uh, our major defense against cancer of many kinds. Vitamin D receptors are found throughout the brain, and there are very striking correlations found in vitamin D deficiency and emotional and mental disorders. Uh, a whole series of very interesting papers coming out of Scandinavia showing that dark-skinned immigrants from Africa to move to Scandinavia have unusually high incidence of schizophrenia, and this has been associated with low vitamin D levels. I mean, who would have thought that vitamin D could have a correlation with psychosis. Again, the very, it's an easy thing to check. So, these are just on the, things on the physical level to think about when dealing with, uh, people who are depressed, as, I think, I think this also applies to, uh, anxiety disorders, as well. In the realm of the mind, uh, I, I am fascinated by the very different approaches that have been taken in the West and in the East. Uh, in Western psychology, for a long time, the whole aim was insight-oriented psychotherapy; that is, the assumption that by gaining insight into the nature of, of negative thought patterns, this enables people to change them. I think there has been a refreshing influence in the field of positive psychology and cognitive-behavioral therapy, which may be much more time- and cost-effective in showing people how to do this. But, you know, there's also a very interesting consideration, here, uh, and, and, let me back up a moment. I'm not so sure we're supposed to be happy all the time. Uh...

00:36:30
ANDREW WEIL In fact, the, um, the root meaning of the word 'happy' comes from an old Norse root that means 'luck' or 'fortune'. Uh, with, it's the same root that comes out in 'perhaps' and 'happenstance' and that suggests that people have traditionally linked happiness with external circumstances, and I think, in fact, most people in this culture, that's just the way they think; that they imagine they'll be happy if they get something they now don't have. Um, I don't think that's a great way to think, and I, I also feel we labor under a very toxic cultural expectation that we're supposed to be happy all the time, and that our kids are supposed to be happy all the time. Nowhere is that more apparent or more horrible than during the holiday season, which, thankfully, we have just come out of. You know, in the, in, traditionally, in the Northern Hemisphere, the Winter Solstice has been seen as a time of danger; it's when the life force is at its lowest ebb, the, the days are shortest, nights are longest, the period of bad weather is yet to come. I think the natural human response is to huddle together, build fires, feast, tell stories, and wait it out. It's certainly not to be happy all the time, and the, the disconnect between the, that, the natural phenomena of that period and one's actual experience, especially when you're crammed together with all your relatives, and get, and get things you never wanted and have to give things that are expensive, (inaudible ) it all adds up to a big, emotional mess. But I think that, that same cultural expectation is present throughout the year in, in more muted form, and I don't think it's correct. I think our moods are supposed to vary, I think, just as there're sunny days and cloudy days, we're supposed to have positive moods and negative moods. I think the goal is not to get stuck in the negative moods and not to have them be so profound that they disable you, but there may be value in them, as well, and this is linking back to what I was talking about earlier. You know, one of the hallmarks of depression is depressive rumination; chewing over the same thought patterns over and over, and as I said, Western psychology, I think, now has new methods that are much more effective at teaching people to get out of them. But very recently, several evolutionary psychologists have suggested that there may be value in, to depression and depressive rumination and even that natural selection may have favored a depressive trait in human beings. And their reasoning is that the essence of depression, a strong inward focus and this tendency to ruminate, to chew things over and over, favors problem solving and creativity, and that if one is faced with a very difficult problem, that the ability to go inward and just ruminate on it until either you decide that it's insoluble and you give it up or your find the solution and move on; that this may have been favored by evolution. And this may be one explanation for the striking correlation between depression and creativity, which we see all around us. You know, the, the, and I'm sure you're all aware of the incredible number of very successful and productive artists, composers, writers, who have suffered from depression, and many of whom have turned to alcohol and drugs, some have committed suicide, but this is a striking correlation. So, I don't think the goal is to make all that go away. At any rate, in Eastern psychology, there's been a very different approach followed, which is to try, to train people to keep attention focused in the present. And that that kind of training, in a, one great example of it, which is (inaudible ) on here is mindfulness training, you know, gathering awareness and really keeping it in the present moment; it seemed to be highly protective against the emotional problems that are so prevalent in our society. That's pretty difficult to do, here, and I think this is an, this is an, an area in which the destructive effects of the new media and information technology have really done us a lot of disservice. You know, all of this stuff: email, internet, uh, cell phones, texting; there're many, many effects. I think this is changing brain function, I don't think we know exactly how. Uh, I, I, I observe a collective decrease in attention span in our culture, um, and all academics and teachers that I talk to observe this in their students. The one way that I, that I first noticed this is that I don't watch much television, but when I do, I'm very disturbed by how short the scenes are now, that there's such rapid cutting. And when I've tried to show my daughter, uh, who's now 20, but when she was in her teens, some of my favorite movies from growing up, she finds them boring because they're too slow. Uh, anyway, that's one thing I observe. I think that all of the stimulation encourages multi-tasking. Uh, brain research is very clear in this, on this subject; the human brain cannot do more than one thing at a time. All, all, all it can do is switch rapidly back and forth, and you can get very good at that switching, and I have no doubt that kids raised on all this stuff are much better at that kind of switching than I am, and they may be much better, probably, at hand-eye coordination from playing video games. But, I think the long-term effects remain to be seen. I mean, the, the, the evidence is very clear that in, when you multi-task, performance suffers. Um, I think it's very difficult to detach from all this stuff, and, and let me tell you another story from my, uh, early Harvard days. I was, uh, I mostly majored in botany as an undergraduate, but before I did, I tried to study psychology because I was interested in consciousness and I wanted to know how the mind affected the body and how the, your, your perceptions were in, were influenced by the, your particular, um, experiences and how they might differ from other people's perceptions. I was totally unable to do that because at Harvard, in those days, psychology was completely dominated by B.F. Skinner and behaviorism, uh, and the whole point of behaviorism was to try to explain behavior without any reference to the mind, which was seen as a black box that you couldn't understand. Uh, B.F. Skinner was a very, uh, charming, articulate lecturer, and I fell under his spell, and for a year, he was my adviser, as a psychology student. And I learned a lot of interesting things there, and, you know, one of the, his, a lot, most of his work was with rats and pigeons in, in cages, who responded to getting food pellets on certain schedules. And Skinner showed that the way animals behaved in these situations depended on the schedules of reinforcement. Where, on whether the food pellet came after a fixed or variable interval of time, or a fixed or variable ratio in response to the number of presses of a lever or bar. And the most powerful influence on behavior was when the reinforcement came on what's called a 'variable ratio schedule'; that is, the, the animal gets the food pellet after pressing the bar a certain number of times, but that number varies from time to time and the animal has no way of knowing, you know, when it's going to come. Animals will work themselves to exhaustion to get food on a variable ratio schedule. That is exactly how slot machines pay off. Exactly. And we can all see the influence that that has on behavior. Well, that's how email pays off. Once in a while, you get a food pellet, and, and, you know, a, a love note, news of a business success, a funny video. But they come in on a variable ratio schedule in response to how often you check email. And if there is a ping or a "you've got mail" associated with that, that becomes an even more powerful associated stimulus. At any rate, I'm, I'm just giving you, this is why it is so difficult not to check email. You know, it's not your fault; this is straight, this is straight behaviorist animal research. So, uh, all I can say about that is I think it's very important to find ways of limiting this in your life, and to help other people do that. I, I don't know the, I don't have an answer. I mean, what I try to do is, uh, you know, I, I try to make a rule that somewhere in the afternoon, maybe two, maybe three, I disconnect from my computer and I try not to look at it until the next morning. I don't always succeed, and I find it more and more difficult to limit this kind of stuff. But it's there; I think it makes people crazy. One of the, uh, one of the experiences that I have, and see if this correlates with yours, I have a sense of time passing faster and faster, uh, and, you know, I've always heard that as you grow older, time passes faster. One explanation is that each unit of time is a smaller fraction of the total that you've lived, but I was very surprised some year ago, I think this is, again, when my daughter was somewhere around 13, she told me she had the same experience, and her friends did, as well; that Christmas seems to come around like (non-English noise). You know, I didn't have that experience when I was her age. I remember summer vacations being endless, uh, Christmas, you know, from Christmas to Christmas was really long. You know, time was speeded up for us, today, and I think it's because more is happening per unit of time, there's more stimulation. I think this strongly, uh, I, I think this strongly contributes to anxiety, I think it contributes to insomnia. Uh, by the way, in the front row, here, my colleague, Dr. Rubin Naiman, who's the expert on integrative sleep and dreaming at our center, uh, I want to mention that on Saturday, he's giving an open workshop on integrative mental health, called "21st Century Healing" that will follow up on a lot of what I'm saying, here, and I would urge you to go to that. So, we've got a big problem in our culture. You know, we have all of these, uh, there are so many forces moving us away from emotional well-being, and you're out there, in the front lines, trying to help people, you know, deal with all this. I was very surprised, in, uh, writing 'Spontaneous Happiness' to discover how much actual scientific research had been done in the area of what I call 'secular spirituality'. Uh, that is, by secular spirituality, I mean, uh, attending to the non-physical dimension of human life, but without reference to a deity, a sacred book, or propositions that are scientifically unprovable. Um, I think there are many influences of the, on, of, on the non-physical, from the non-physical dimension that strongly affect our physical well-being and mental-emotional well-being. For example, there are, have been a lot of studies on the power of gratitude to boost mood. There're two aspects of this; one is feeling grateful and the other is expressing gratitude. Um, I'm sure you're aware of the exercise from positive psychology, very simple, keeping a gratitude journal, uh, you know, getting a little notebook, keeping it by your bedside during the day and making mental notes of things to be grateful for, which can be as, you know, everything from the sun rising to the cherry blossoms out there to the music we heard; at night, you just jot these down. There is a study showing that doing this for one week can boost mood for up to six months. I mean, that's amazing. And there's nothing in the way of it. All you have to do is remember to do it. There's also a lot of scientific research on the power of forgiveness to boost mood, but forgiveness is tricky; there's a lot that gets in the way of that. I'm not going to go there, but with, with gratitude, really, there is nothing. Also, there's been very interesting scientific research showing that emotional states are contagious and that they can be tracked through populations in exactly the same way that the movement of epidemics can be tracked. Uh, there's, uh, one study showing that if you have a friend who lives within a half mile of you who becomes happy, your chance of being happy are increased by something like 35 percent. And the effect falls off with distance; beyond a certain distance, there's no effect. So, that's certainly an argument for making an inventory in your life of people you associate with and making a resolution, and advising others to resolve, to spend more time in the company of people who make you feel good. I mean, that's pretty obvious. You know, at, at, Rich Simon said that, uh, I have been a proponent of common sense in medicine. I think I have been, and it's just a shame that that seems to be so deficient in, uh, in many areas. In the same way, I think, you know, it's obvious that if you watch a lot of sad movies and read sad books and listen to sad music, that, chances are, you'll be sadder than if you'd listened to the kind of stuff we heard this morning. I mean, these are all very simple things to be able to advise people about. So, I guess, in summary, I just want to leave you message that there is so much beyond brain biochemistry. Uh, the field of integrative mental health is just wide open and welcoming you all into it. I think patients are hungry for this, mental health practitioners are hungry for this; it is time to throw off the stifling influence of the biomedical model. Uh...

ANDREW WEIL You know, and I see you as all, you know, very active, uh, workers in this movement. It really is a, a time of paradigm change. It's great, there's a lot of things you can do on the practical level, such as writing your legislators about ending direct consumer advertising of drugs. You know, learn the principles of an anti-inflammatory diet, uh, you know, read up on some of these, these simple interventions that can be done, uh, because we are, we have a real problem in our society. This is a major, major epidemic of emotional ill-health that we're witnessing, and I think it is, it is a product of our times, it's a product of the way we live, and the biomedical model severely limits our ability to deal with it, either preventatively or therapeutically. Thank you.
