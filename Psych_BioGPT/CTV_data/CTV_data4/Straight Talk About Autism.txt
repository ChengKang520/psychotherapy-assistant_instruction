00:00:50
SUSAN SCOTT Jennifer has been subjected to a lot... a lot of unpleasantness in her life from... from other kids. 

00:01:00
JENNIFER SCOTT I can't tell you... you know (inaudible ) how bad it feels. 

00:01:10
SUSAN SCOTT Its heart breaking, it truly as to see your child so sad, over things that umm... you know the people were... were doing to her. 

00:01:25
JENNIFER SCOTT I'm now just missing out and what my friendship I always to offer, I guess.

STRAIGHT TALK about AUTISM 

00:01:55
Adolescence 

00:02:05
teasing 

00:02:10
SUSAN SCOTT We'll always try to explain to Jennifer that a lot of people who don't understand her, or who don't anything tend to be afraid, and the fear will come as trying to isolate Jennifer (inaudible ) by calling her names and thinking things that… that… about her that simply aren't true. 

00:02:30
JENNIFER SCOTT If umm… they don't like you because I’m different on that (inaudible ) 

00:02:45
SUSAN SCOTT She is a strong young lady and she certainly has umm… you know live through it and you know maybe she is a better person because of it, I don't know, but I certainly would have liked it more if it hadn’t happened. 

00:03:00
MATT WARD The things that I heard most in junior high was being teased. That was even worse than the homework. 

00:03:05
NANCY ALAR Teasing was problem, especially in Junior high, that's where the kids I think are trying to sort out the hierarchy of who's on top and who isn't, and Matthew was definitely wasn't. 

00:03:20
MATT WARD I mean kids used to try to upset me by imitating me or trying to get me in trouble. They thought, it was funny that I was so weird. 

00:03:25
NANCY ALAR People would do subtle things to him; things that weren’t obvious to the teacher, like they found out that one day when they asked him for a pencil and he didn't have one and he got all upset because it’s that… that innocent question started a cascade of anxiety for him. Well the kids picked up on that. So, people would walk by him in the hall and whisper, you got a pencil Mattew? 

00:03:50
MATT WARD They wanted me to act even strangers, so they could laugh at me. I knew they were being mean to me, but never could understand exactly what was happening. Sometimes, I got so frustrated that I just lost it in three fit. I didn't know that… I didn't know that was… I didn't know that was what the mean kids wanted me to do. 

00:04:15
NANCY ALAR Some of, like I said, was extremely subtle. Others that was just blatant, people would trip him, push him, make fun of him, imitate his voice and he knew that, that was teasing, but he didn't know exactly why he has adapted over time. He just ignores people mostly, that's something that as an autistic person he would tend to maybe do any away, but that's become his coping mechanism. So be very seldom interacts with any one. 

00:04:45
TOM KINNEY Did you like high school? 

00:04:50
MATT FLICKINGER Well, it was okay, but there are some parts I didn't like, and those parts (inaudible ). Sometimes… the school wasn't just… some people were not nice in the school. And they just didn't feel right there. Kids used to tease me because they... they thought that I was weird. Because of the way my behavior was… that was really… that was… it was just kind of rib behavior. I don’t think they knew about my disability because I didn't tell, but they were thinking that something was wrong. 

00:05:30
CHRIS BELLI The teasing, I mean you know that was another thing he is… he is stuck out like sore thorn. 

00:05:35
MATT FLICKINGER They maybe feel really bad. 

00:05:45
CHRIS UMHOEFER Like sometimes, when I get teased or laugh, I… I tend to umm... get in like bad a bad, a lonely mood or something and I don't like to be in classes at those times. 

00:06:05
TOM KINNEY When kids make fun of you in school, what do they say or what do they do? 

00:06:10
CHRIS UMHOEFER They… they tend to make fun of we… about things related to why autism like… like I like a blink a lot, so they try… so they always make fun of that. And mostly, its the boys that make fun of me, and they also make fun of me for those stuff like... like… umm… my… the way that I talk and stuff like that. It makes me feel kind of bad because I can't help it. I can only help it to a certain extent and it has gotten better over the years. Well, I would like to have more friends and people that don't tease me about things that are related to my autism and stuff like that. 

00:07:15
friends 

00:07:20
TOM KINNEY Does Matt uh… did he have a social life in school? Does he have a social life now? 

00:07:24
CHRIS BELLI Matt did not have a social life in school as a matter of fact; he did not have one friend. And that was really... really hard for him, and you know hard for me. Umm… I not think he really care it at first, maybe up until he was 15 and 16. I don't think he really wanted to have any friends. And then about age 16, he decided… you know I would like have friends everybody else does, and he would try, but in very inappropriate way. So, socialization skills are just not there and umm… you couldn't connect and that was more frustrating for him and so, he really never had any friends. 

00:08:05
Ben Serak 

00:08:10
JAN SERAK I think most parents that I talk to all wish that their children were able to have a lot more friends than they do. And he has some very… um… people that he is very close with, but they’re either family, his brother you know, which his family. Umm… people that he is gotten to know through the educational system either teachers or his support people who he really… I mean he has a very close relationship right now with his umm… uh… special education aid in school, who's a young… who’s like 23, so he is very close in age and they are very close and yet that’s all people. 

00:08:55
TOM KINNEY That must have been painful for you to watch him struggle with that? 

00:09:00
CHRIS BELLI That’s really painful for me. Umm… I’ma very social person and friendships are very, very important to me. Umm… I just couldn't imagine how he can live like that and I just wanted everything for him, I wanted friends, a normal typical life. So, it’s very painful. 

00:09:25
JAN SERAK Nobody calls him up and says, hi do you wanna go to a movie? So social life is if you interpret it as going out and doing those kinds of things that’s pretty nil. 

00:09:35
TOM KINNEY That’s something you can manipulate for your kid? 

00:09:35
CHRIS BELLI No, you cannot. And… and that's one thing that umm… I know what… the agency that we workout, we do try to help with socialization with children, with special needs. But its really, it is difficult, its… its not something you can really make happen. You can… you can try to make it happen and sometimes things do workout, but you cannot make the peers connect. They might do it for a while you know just to be good kids, but you can't make them really want to be friends. 

00:10:10
[sil.] 

00:10:15
lonely 

00:10:20
TOM KINNEY Was he significantly developmentally delayed going into school? 

00:10:20
TOM UMHOEFER Umm… Not cognitively. So, he is always very smart, he’s all in the social areas. He was just really concave, socially he always had trouble making friends. 

00:10:35
NARRATOR What you have described him as lonely in high school or…? 

00:10:35
CHRIS BELLI Oh, very lonely. Yeah, definitely. Umm… Very lonely, very isolated. 

00:10:40
TOM UMHOEFER He had trouble doing imaginative play, you know and he couldn't pretend. He is sort of good, but not the way kids really do and he couldn't do any pretending, playing and he tried out to put it into what his interests were to that they had time was like whether numbers or something and he kind of work that and the other kids would think that be gonna weird. 

00:11:05
JAN SERAK I don't think he sets wrong… being horribly said, but it might be. And he may not be able to talk about that. 

00:11:15
TOM KINNEY How does that make you feel to see him sort of left out off things? 

00:11:20
JAN SERAK I would like him to be much more umm… I would like… I would love it, if somebody call and say, hi, do you want to come to a party? Hi, do wanna got to a movie would be great. 

00:11:30
TOM KINNEY Would you describe him as lonely with that? 

00:11:35
TOM UMHOEFER Oh definitely... Definitely. Umm… he had no friends umm… when he was in uh… early grade school, he would do few sleep over with kids. Umm… Kindergarten first grade or so, a few kids had sort of made friends with and he went over to their houses and make him over in our house. Umm… but that’s stopped by maybe second grade you know because, you know he was be… just becoming so different. 

00:12:00
Megan Lusk 

00:12:05
LAURINE LUSK You know, I’ve heard the theory about emotional distance and I really think that these umm… young people and adults uh… want relationships are lonely and a way that they are trapped in a body that doesn't work, and they want friendships as much as anybody else and need them as much as anybody else. But I think that they’re just struggling so much with a body that doesn't work with a neurological system that's causing them to experience pain at all times. So, what I noticed with Megan was that she was in that antipredator, fight or flight umm… level at all times. She was wondering what was going to start on her next. So she didn't have that luxury to be making friends or to learn all of those subtle social queues that other kids just pick up incidentally through friendships and play time. 

00:13:00
SUSAN SCOTT I think if I was in Jennifer's shoes, I would be lonely, but she doesn’t appear to be umm… too lonely, umm… especially this year and actually the last couple of years then she spent in high school. she seems to be actually quite a bit happier. She likes to go to dances at the school, she frequently goes alone that doesn't bother her at all, she seems to prefer that and she can dance with a number of guys there and isn't connected to just and umm… it works out very well for Jennifer, but it for me, I would be uncomfortable, if I was in her shoes. But she seems fine with that. 

00:13:45
LAURINE LUSK I think Meg is quite lonely. Umm… for years, she would call students that she had enjoyed been around from her class. What we found was that it never carried over at… into the after school hours or the weekend hours, and she call each one of them week after week after week. And she would hang up for me to call and she cry. And I would try to prepare her before the calls, I would say, “Megan, maybe they’ll be able to do something and maybe they won't and if they can't, just tell them, maybe next time”. And then I turn around and cry and try not to let Meg see me. Over the years after Meg had tried so many, many times, she slowly accepted I think, that a friendship might not happen. And now it’s kind of difficult to actually to talk her into approaching another student. I think its... its just the natural reaction to be shown(ph) so many times. 

00:14:45
making friends 

00:14:50
TOM KINNEY Did you have friends outside of high school? 

00:14:55
MATT FLICKINGER Well, I do have. I did have one named Richard Rusen(ph), and then there was another one named… another one named Eric Johnson. 

00:15:05
TOM KINNEY Could you tell me a little bit about your friends? 

00:15:05
MATT FLICKINGER Well, Richard Rusen he is uh… he lives with his parents and he is out of college and he his working now, but he has autism too. And Eric Johnson is the other one who has autism. Sometimes, me and him don’t get along very good because he has some strange ways than I do. 

00:15:30
MATT WARD For a long time, I didn't have any friends, but I do have a few close friends now, most of them are also autistic young people. My closest friend is Chirs who plays video games with me, he often sleeps of… he often sleeps over at my house and we stay up until the middle of the night playing nintendo 64. 

00:15:55
TOM KINNEY Do you do things together with them sometimes? 

00:16:00
MATT FLICKINGER Yeah, we have good… we have good fun most of the time. I also got a friend right now named Chris… Chris Umhoefer. Yeah, he is very nice, he likes to play video games he is a video game with him. 

00:16:10
TOM KINNEY Do have any friends outside of High School? 

00:16:15
CHRIS UMHOEFER Yes, I do. 

00:16:15
TOM KINNEY Could you tell me a little bit about them? 

00:16:15
CHRIS UMHOEFER I… One of my friends is Matt Ward and he is umm… autistic and umm… he likes to play intendo and stuff, but he doesn't talk much. And another one is Matt Flickinger and he is more like we that he talks a lot and stuff like that and I used to have another friend that was in my high school last year named Jeremy, but he moved to Colorado. 

00:16:50
TOM KINNEY So, what are the things you do with some of your friends, besides playing video games? 

00:17:00
MATT FLICKINGER Well, we go to eat and walk around. And I also made a new friend in building where in my apartment where I live. His name is John… John Craw(ph) I think. And I haven't seen him (inaudible ) we do movies and stuff like that. 

00:17:25
CHRIS UMHOEFER I have also made a… a girlfriend on the Internet. 

00:17:35
TOM KINNEY Could you tell me a little bit about that? 

00:17:35
CHRIS UMHOEFER Well, we just talk to each other like via email. 

00:17:40
TOM KINNEY What is her name and where does she live? 

00:17:45
CHRIS UMHOEFER Her name is Travella(ph) and she lives in Indiana Police, Indiana 

00:17:50
TOM KINNEY So, you exchange email with Travella(ph)? 

00:17:55
CHRIS UMHOEFER Yeah. 

00:17:55
TOM KINNEY How long have you been doing that? 

00:17:55
CHRIS UMHOEFER Umm… For the past couple of months. 

00:18:00
TOM KINNEY How often do you talk to Travella(ph)? 

00:18:05
CHRIS UMHOEFER However, often she writes back. 

00:18:10
MATT WARD Like most autistic people, I’m constantly struggling to communicate. The frustrations of this struggle us… the frustrations of this struggle often make me feel tense and nervous. My language is quite good, but talking is stressful because it takes a lot of effort for me. My voice often sounds funny and I’ve very few… I have very few friends because of my communications problems. My mom explain… my mom explained to me that there are little things about the way I move in the tone of my voice that signal to you (inaudible ) neural, typical people that I’m different. It is easier for me to talk when I can read the words. That’s why I am able to give these speeches. One of… one of the good things about being autistic is I never embarrassed to speak in front of large crowds. Last April, I addressed the legislate of joint finance committee in Mason. I’ve also spoken a couple of conferences; the last thing my mom expected was to see me on speaker circuit, but here I’m. 

00:19:30
a friend, finally 

00:19:30
TOM KINNEY Is there anyway to encourage him to be more involved in social area? I’m sure, you though about him many times. 

00:19:35
JAN SERAK Well, he… you know he’s not gonna initiate it really, I mean he's probably not going to cause (inaudible ) and say that. Umm… I've tried to make the opportunities available, I mean I’ve tried to… that's the reason why we tried to get him into the regular education settings, so that more people would get to know him. 

00:19:55
SUSAN SCOTT This year in school, she does have umm...a couple of girls that she is (inaudible ), she is able to do teenage type things like umm...hang out, and their outside appearance is...is very interesting. They have very colorful hair umm...none of the colors naturally occurring that I'm aware of blues, purples, umm...very-very red, reds umm...they tend to wear black cloths and fishnet stockings. Umm...attention umm...getting attire that they wear and Jennifer is very attracted to umm...those things, which are out of the ordinaries, so umm... and they've welcomed Jennifer into their social group and umm... and she is...she is quite comfortable in that group. 

00:20:55
JENNIFER SCOTT Lot of them are very strange, or let...lets just head out(ph), umm... one of…of them dyes her hair, a different color every week and that's its really interesting and I don't know what it's going to be on this week, so don't ask me. 

00:21:15
SUSAN SCOTT So, it's nice that Jennifer has friends. It's certainly is umm... but Jennifer sometimes has difficult time differentiating between ah...aspects of a friend that are desirable and aspects that would not be, so she tends to mimic and umm...well mimic to good and the bad that, that some of these kids are umm...displaying. 

00:21:40
CHRIS BELLI We would try to set him up with some…some friends and he might try to connect that did try to set him up with umm...a boy that had autism Baraboo but because of the distance, you know it didn't work out to grade, and then kinda, and kinda tired of it. He got tired of it and he really, he didn't wanna work on the friendship aspect and, and totally got older. 

00:22:10
JAN SERAK Try to umm...getting them involved in groups I mean, he started going to the YM...YMCA now daily and who know he might meet somebody over there. I... I think you just have to keep getting them out and getting them into different activities. 

00:22:25
MATT WARD My friend Erin and I go to the same high school and went to (inaudible ) together this year. She like dancing a lot by...but the just it’s my thing. 

00:22:40
CHRIS BELLI Finally, he does have one friend that he spends just about every weekend with and he also has autism and they’re great buddies and some day, they...they liked to live together. So, it's been really terrific for Matt from that to have a friend finally. 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:05
social group 

00:23:10
NANCY ALAR The Madison Chapter of the Autistic Society of America sponsors a social group for young people with autism and I’m the coordinator of that group. What we do is monthly we get together and do some type of social activity. Most of the stuff is around here… We organized five teams of…of two kids each to go out and look for some plants and other kinds of things ah…nature scavenger hunt. The goal of this was to have the kids be in assigned in teams randomly so that they had to do a little social interaction. The parents also have a chance to sit together and talk about some of the issues they’re facing “What happened with the latest IEP.” It was something that I never anticipated when I volunteered to be the coordinator, I knew that it would be beneficial for my son to be able to go out and do some kind of organized activities with other young people. But working with the parents and making the friendships and even having the siblings that always come along have their own set of friendships has been very-very rewarding. We all had a very good time. We shared a picnic lunch after it was all over and had chance to just sit and talk and like the younger kids ran down to the playground and we all said well we’ll see you next month and next month will get together and go to baseball game and probably the month after that we’re gonna go play miniature golf together. Hopefully, what happens when these kids get together like this as they form friendships, in fact one of the things that happened today is four of the young man who’re Nintendo Fanatic, all went home together to spend the afternoon playing Nitendo games. They did not have these friendships over a year ago, ‘coz this group has now been going for approximately a year and my son a year ago, he had no friends basically. Now people are actually calling Matt up and saying Matt can you come over or Kris(ph) calls Matt up and says “Matt can I come over to your house.” Autistic people tend to always speak their minds and if they want to come over, they will call you up and invite themselves over. So, it’s been very successful in that way. 

00:25:35
circle of friends 

00:25:40
MEGAN LUSK My name is Megan Lusk and I’m 17 right now. 

00:25:45
LAURINE LUSK Well, we know that Megan wants to have friends, but it’s kinda difficult for her to carry on reciprocal relationship and so Lynn and I’ve been working together for a number of years umm…kind of helping to support Meg developing friendships with their classmates. 

00:26:00
LYNN BERGE So, he found a variety of students and we’ve met together once a week for a number of months and we just get to know Meg a little bit as friends do and talk about some of Meg’s challenges so that kids understand what it’s like for Meg, and then try to help them where in how to be natural supports for her eat lunch with her or when they see her in class, say “Hello” greet her in the hallway, just as other friends do in the circle of friends group. 

00:26:35
This looks kinda funny…Ha…ha… 

00:26:40
MEGAN LUSK Although it’s like… I think we do together like girls and we just have umm…parties and stuff and we also like umm…out for lunch sometimes and we just do things outdoors sometimes. 

00:27:00
LAURINE LUSK I think it gives her practice. A lot of times when we group kids with disabilities together umm…neither of the two children in a relationship can go 50% umm… if they both have the similar communication or social delays, it’s difficult to…to have a relationship take hold and with these kids, I think it’s working because, they can go a little bit more than 50% in relationship. 

00:27:25
Girls can you add anything here. 

00:27:25
Yeah girls can have anything they want. 

00:27:25
TOM KINNEY Ah…have these relationships extended beyond the school day. 

00:27:30
LYNN BERGE Yes, the girls have gone to movies together, umm…gone shopping one of Meg’s favorite activities and theirs I think. Umm…so that you know they’ve…they’ve got into together I think Meg spent the night at Sara’s house and just the same kind of things all friends do together. 

00:27:45
And if you’re making pizza (inaudible ) through the dough. 

00:27:51
LYNN BERGE Now, she has had a lot of fun with them after school as well and on weekends. 

00:28:00
TOM KINNEY Do you ever call them up and do things with them outside? 

00:28:00
MEGAN LUSK Yeah. Hum…hum… Umm… yes going to movies and umm… go to the mall and umm…it’s been a night, (inaudible ) May be I used to go out for lunch and we always have parties at school. 

00:28:20
LAURINE LUSK I think just that gentle facilitation that Lynn has provided helping the other kids know how to support Meg, and then helping Meg sometimes breaking the conversations when she is too shy to speak up. I think it’s been very helpful. Getting the kids together at the same time has sort of given the ability for a friendship relationship to develop, because the kids are finally getting to know Meg. 

00:28:45
LYNN BERGE When the kids are often busy with school work and school activities and sometimes don’t think to take the time and I think the group has given them that time initially to become friends, and then the friendship is growing naturally from that. 

00:29:05
MEGAN LUSK And I just, I was struggling hard, ‘coz everyone was… 

00:29:05
TOM KINNEY And how about the other kids what do they get out of them? 

00:29:10
LYNN BERGE Well I think the other kids get a lot out of it for one they, they have an nice friend in Meg and they enjoy her company and umm… they’ve gotten to know about other kids like Meg and have learned a lot about being sensitive to other people and they’ve umm…learned how to respond to other people in the school who don’t know Meg Umm…so, I think, they’ve gotten a lot of out of it. 

00:29:40
LAURINE LUSK I think, Meg is such a cool kid. A lot of times, people don’t get close enough to her to find out and with just this extra little help, it’s given them an opportunity to have safe place to ask questions. They can talk to Lynn privately, if…if…problem or an issue might come up, and then it’s just given them that little jumps start to get to know people and to actually celebrate diversity instead fearing that. 

00:30:05
This is gonna be like one rich chocolate (inaudible ) 

00:30:10
LAURINE LUSK What to Meg, it means that there’s kids that know about her and care about her at school. Kids that’ll eat lunch with her, say hi to her in the hall. It actually helps her to feel like she belongs in her school community and what it’s meant to me has been tremendous. I…I get to have the rewards that many mothers have had and some may be have taken for granted, but I certainly don’t. To have kids that care about Meg is very-very important. 

00:30:40

00:30:45
independence day 

00:30:50
MATT FLICKINGER If they like about living independently is that I feel more free. 

00:30:55
CHRIS UMHOEFER Yes I would like to live independent like Matt. 

00:30:55
MATT FLICKINGER Oh hello Chris. How are you doing? I haven’t seen you long time. Hey, have a seat. 

00:31:00
CHRIS UMHOEFER Because you get more freedom in that way and It’s one think I’ve always wanted. Now we play some Nintendo. 

00:31:10
MATT FLICKINGER Cool. 

00:31:10
When Chris comes over this Saturday night, he’ll actually play with video games in the computer. 

00:31:15
CHRIS UMHOEFER Cool… 

00:31:15
That’s like an expert move. 

00:31:20
CHRIS UMHOEFER I know it is. 

00:31:20
Do you think you could win the game without hitting enemy. 

00:31:25
CHRIS UMHOEFER I know it’s possible, but it’s extremely hard insane. 

00:31:30
You could do that. 

00:31:30
CHRIS UMHOEFER It’s insane to do it. 

00:31:30
MATT FLICKINGER You could. I like going to college very well and I may take some classes in the fall. 

00:31:35
CHRIS UMHOEFER I’ve planned I’m going to college like Matt also. I used to want… wanted to be a meteorologist, a prequalification for tornado warning is tornado is seen on the ground. Rotation is spotted on the radar or if a funnel cloud or multiple funnel clouds are heading toward a populated area. Until a few years ago when I changed to wanting to be a computer game programmer. 

00:32:10
MATT FLICKINGER Well at my job, I…I do data entry on Nexdorf(ph) System for income. I like my job very well. 

00:32:20
You have small work…. 

00:32:20
MATT FLICKINGER Okay. 

00:32:20
Can you help me with this? 

00:32:30
MATT FLICKINGER If I have some to take me to the grocery store, and then I just do it myself. 

00:32:35
[sil.] 

00:32:50
He finds what he need in the store. If he has any questions, he ask, we don’t need to interact with anything. 

00:32:55
MATT FLICKINGER Can I have a pen please. Yes I do pay my own bills. Sometimes I usually need help on balancing. I’m not fully independent on that yet. Thank you. 

00:33:05
Thank you. 

00:33:05
And he tends to make special friends with everyone, because he just do breakfast and (inaudible ) very amusing. He likes to make jokes and be funny. 

00:33:20
TOM KINNEY Do you think you’re ready to live independently. 

00:33:20
CHRIS UMHOEFER Yes I think I’m just…is just the matter of time for an apartment opens up. 

00:33:30
being a person with autism 

00:33:30
CHRIS UMHOEFER It means that’s I like have ah…brain disorder well something like that, Oh it’s a kind of hard to describe, but I don’t take it like as an insult or anything and because I think it’s a characteristic and part of me. 

00:34:00
MATT FLICKINGER Well, it means that I have disability and it’s hard for me to do certain things like learn and sometimes I…sometimes rocking to keep myself comfortable. 

00:34:10
TOM KINNEY How about if you could give advice to other kids with autism more in high school who are being made fun of. 

00:34:20
CHRIS UMHOEFER I might say that to try to stick up to your believes and not let anybody try to persuade you or hinder you or not let anybody try you like…like umm…get you down or something. 

00:34:40
JENNIFER SCOTT They’re picking on you they aren’t and they see you fall apart, don’t give them on that sadist action, just don’t do it. If you come to the end of (inaudible ) tie a knot and hang on. 

00:35:10
TOM KINNEY Do you think you should different from other people? 

00:35:10
MATT FLICKINGER No, I’m I feel like I’m telling the same as other people and I…and I know him the same as other people. I’m like everybody else. 

00:35:20
CHRIS UMHOEFER I want sometimes and maybe like set up a things that I could speak to the teachers and some of the students and stuff at school and tell them what autistic really means. He has most of like teachers don’t really understand it either. 

00:35:40
TOM KINNEY Do you think you’re different from other people? 

00:35:45
CHRIS UMHOEFER Sometimes, I don’t really matter of a differences. I’ve learned some of the stuff like from Abraham Lincoln. I mean it’s not bad to the different. I tend to…I…I like to stick up to my own believes and not be persuaded. The biggest think is that he, he always stuck up for what he believed in. 

00:36:15
TOM KINNEY If you had to chance to make a statement to some of the kids in high school that made fun of you, what would you tell them now. 

00:36:25
MATT FLICKINGER Well, I would tell them that I didn’t like the way they treated me because I would tell them about my disability. 

00:36:35
TOM KINNEY How about other kids like you that have disabilities in high school that are they feel bad about being teased, which you have any advice for them? 

00:36:45
MATT FLICKINGER Yes. 

00:36:45
What would you say? 

00:36:50
MATT FLICKINGER Treat him. I would say, you’re like anybody else and you can do anything that you put your mind too.

This video features articulate young people who offered insight into issues important to them. This isn’t to imply that all who have the diagnosis of autism have their expressive abilities, but it does suggest many have great potential and it’s our challenges parents and educators to see it realized. 

00:37:25
Being autistic is part of who I’m sometimes I’ve problems, but I’m continuing with my life. I enjoy my hobbies and I’m proud of my accomplishments. I know there is place for my special task if I can just find it being able to read speeches like this makes me feel like I finally have a voice of my own. Thank you for listening to me.

NANCY ALAR I think only two weeks before the parent interview at the daycare center. I had a nightmare one night. Our family was somewhere in a…in a national park or somewhere. 

00:39:00

00:39:05
NANCY ALAR And suddenly Matthew disappeared. 

00:39:10
[sil.] 

00:39:30
NANCY ALAR He was gone. He was off in the woods and because he didn’t recognize his own name, there was no way anyone could call him. And I woke up and I knew my son was gone forever. And there was no way I could get in back. 

00:40:05

00:40:10

STRAIGHT TALK about AUTISM Childhood first sign 

00:41:00
TOM KINNEY When did you first notice that Chris was different from other kids? 

00:41:05
Chris Umhoefer 

00:41:05
TOM UMHOEFER After may be about six months of age or something. Here he wouldn't interact weaving goodbye to people or doing like so big games and things like that and he would do like but it would be more mechanical. His mom remembers wherein he early on he wouldn't smile. 

00:41:30
Ben Serak 

00:41:30
JAN SERAK When he was about 7 months old, he had made fairly normal progress up until that point he was very stiff almost like a board. I mean I had to feed him holding him straight out like a board. 

00:41:50
Jennifer Scott 

00:41:50
SUSAN SCOTT Well I noticed right away she has some physical differences also so in order straight away when she was born. 

00:42:00
Megan Lust 

00:42:00
LAURINE LUSK When Megan was very young as a baby, we noticed that there were concerns, she had difficulty feeding. She had difficulty sleeping, cried a lot. 

00:42:15
Matt Ward 

00:42:15
NANCY ALAR They then called us in for the parent meeting where they put out this list where they said "your child doesn't know his own name. He doesn't listen to stories. He bangs his head when he is made. He doesn't seem to connect with people at all. He plays with objects by spinning them." 

00:42:35
Maurice Johnson 

00:42:35
DIANE JOHNSON When Maurice was a baby it was hard to get eye contact with him. There was a lot of rocking. He went through a thing of self abuse where he would actually just beat himself up so bad until his head was sort of swollen like a football. 

00:42:50
Chad Haycraft 

00:42:50
TONY HAYCRAFT The school had no way of working with him. They said we would have two people watching him and he is gone. We don't know how he does it, he just disappears. 

00:43:00
Matt Flickinger 

00:43:00
CHRIS BELLI Instead of you know saying mom and juice and asking for things he could repeat any kind of word that he heard over the...over the TV or anything like that. But he just could not really make sense of what he was saying. For instance we always laughed about his...his father would use the word ramification, you know very often when he talked and Matt would run around go ramification... ramification... ramification...but you know which was really cute but we couldn't get him to say juice or milk or mom or dad. 

00:43:40
first diagnosis 

00:43:40
TOM KINNEY How old was he at the age of diagnosis? 

00:43:45
TOM UMHOEFER I was thinking about that coming here I...it was probably about eight or nine. 

00:43:50
TOM KINNEY ...also so late. 

00:43:50
TOM UMHOEFER It was...it was late for autistic diagnosis. When he was about three, we knew he was different enough that we decided to put him in the preschool. 

00:44:05
TOM KINNEY When did you discover that Matt had autism. 

00:44:05
CHRIS BELLI Well, I didn't really suspect a problem until he was approximately two, after his second birthday. 

00:44:15
TOM UMHOEFER It was when we were watching the movie Rain Man and it was just like just incredible it was like the similarities even Chris wasn't this severely autistic as Rain Man was being depicted. But I know if we gotta get some fear and then that’s when he had got diagnosis autistic anyway. 

00:44:35
TOM KINNEY So were you actually saw the movie Rain Man when he was 8 or 9 about that... 

00:44:40
TOM UMHOEFER Yeah about that time yeah. 

00:44:40
TOM KINNEY Was that an accident that you went to the movie? 

00:44:45
TOM UMHOEFER Yeah we just like, oh it sound like good movie you know we didn’t know. I mean we didn't have any idea that...that's what Chris might have been. But I just remember having a strong reaction in the movie of. There was scene where they are driving on a highway and Rain man is like staring at the...near the lines on the road and Chris was internal with lines on the road he called lane markings and he cut out all his shapes and he put him all over the house and because it was highway things all over turned lanes and everything and...and that's gone man. You know I just got for what the movie I was just so...I was just so incredible there is the similarities you know. 

00:45:25
TOM KINNEY Did you see the movie, the Rain man? 

00:45:25
CHRIS UMHOEFER Yes I have. 

00:45:25
TOM KINNEY Would you tell me a little bit about that? 

00:45:30
CHRIS UMHOEFER Well some of the things were like me but it tends to be like more though guy (ph) and Rain man had like more severe autism than me and some of the things I know that you shouldn't do. 

00:45:50
TOM KINNEY For example... 

00:45:50
CHRIS UMHOEFER Like the… like the umm... scene where there is an accident on the inner state(ph) and he wants to get off because he thinks that it's dangerous just because of that but I know that inner states(ph) are the safest highways. 

00:46:15
TOM KINNEY How old was Chad at the age of diagnosis 

00:46:20
TONY HAYCROFT He was five when they first, it was a...he is actually he was in second part of kindergarten. 

00:46:30
SUSAN SCOTT She was actually 12 years old. 

00:46:30
TONY HAYCROFT And they said autistic, I thought they said artistic never thought nothing about it, until the second time I went there and I said artistic in what area you know because I which is oh no not artistic, autistic. So then I had to go and read up what is autistic or autism, you know in...in the stuff I read I said no way you know this Chad has none of the stuff. 

00:46:55
don't worry 

00:47:00
LAURINE LUSK We went to pediatricians over and over and they continually told me that she was late bloomer. She was our first daughter, watch in weight and kind of scolded me not to worry so much. 

00:47:15
CHRIS BELLI The medical people, pediatricians I took him to his pediatrician and he said you're worrying too much you know if you weren't you know stop being anxious it's making things worse for him and so of course I get into big guilt thing of okay I'm making it worse umm....and you know everybody is pretty much around me just kept saying you're worrying too much, our friends, relatives and you know I...I thought you know it must be me. But then finally I broke down, I was the only one that would do it and I took him to a child psychiatrist at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and it was at that time that they discovered that he had autism. 

00:48:00
SUSAN SCOTT Behavior wise it...it really took me quite a long time to catch on that she was different because she is my first child. 

00:48:05
JAN SERAK You know I don't know because he was my first child I'm not sure. 

00:48:10
SUSAN SCOTT She seemed alright to me. 

00:48:15
TOM KINNEY How was your first child? 

00:48:15
CHRIS BELLI First and only 

00:48:20
mis-diagnoses 

00:48:25
LAURINE LUSK And so over the years as we kept asking questions and pressing for the answers we went through a number of evaluations in various states actually searching for the answers and she was misdiagnosed about five times until she was aged nine and...and we finally got the correct diagnosis. 

00:48:40
SUSAN SCOTT She was diagnosed incorrectly several other times. 

00:48:45
TONY HAYCROFT So I think by first grade is when he was diagnosed as bipolar mood disorder and so we put him on, he was on some medication and the medication helped a lot, monitors behaviors, some kinda torn him down some… but it didn't improve the way we would let it to move. 

00:49:10
SUSAN SCOTT The first diagnosis that we received was that she was severely more significantly mentally retarded and probably would never learn how to walk or talk. 

00:49:20
TOM KINNEY Was there any other diagnosis besides bipolar mood disorder? 

00:49:20
TONY HAYCROFT No…no obsessive compulsive or something else. He fits in a lot of different categories. You can....have read some lot of DSM definitions and stuff. He has got parts of all, lots of different things, because lots of these are so grey. 

00:49:35
SUSAN SCOTT She obviously did learn how to walk and talk. And she is obviously does not have a cognitive delay either. So when that became apparent about the time she went into kindergarten, the diagnosis was switched to ADHD. 

00:49:55
JAN SERAK You kind of as a parent knew that there probably was something wrong he didn't know exactly what it was and none of the professionals were willing to give a referral even. 

00:50:05
TOM KINNEY Were she treated as an ADHD kid until she 12 years old? 

00:50:10
SUSAN SCOTT Yes...yes but the standard medication therapies, Ritalin. She actually did a number of different drug because none of them worked away. We would have liked them to work which certainly started leading me to believe that ADHD probably wasn't what we were dealing with here. 

00:50:35
JAN SERAK And I think looking back on that part of it is I think physicians are often afraid to I don't know what cause you undo concern or they are just not well informed enough to pick it up themselves. 

00:50:50
SUSAN SCOTT That certainly fit some of her symptoms but it wasn't a complete answer so we continue to look into the issue and friends and folks were able to describe what autism was to me and then I realized that more closely fit the symptoms of my daughter had. 

00:51:15
CHRIS BELLI Each of diagnosis was let say around two-and-a-half. 

00:51:20
TOM KINNEY Then did they prescribed some treatment or programming from at that point? 

00:51:25
CHRIS BELLI No see this is the really strange thing. It's...it was a rollercoaster after that point. They ask us to comeback six months later and when we came back six months later Matt was kind of he was completely different. So then they said well wait a minute I don't...I don't think this is really autism after all. And so then they referred us to another doctor... another child psychiatrist and when we saw this child psychiatrist he said that Matt had attention deficit disorder, which she know that was kind of big sigh of relief for us and they put him on Ritalin, which actually helped a lot with the hyperactivity and the attention deficit. But as time went on and the behavior problems got out of control again I knew that you know deep down inside there were something more but again this autism had gone to attention deficit disorder and we kept with the psychiatrist and from that point as he got older the diagnosis went into bipolar disorder because he became depressed and then into Tourette’s syndrome and then pervasive developmental disorder and then at that point we got we finally decided to get another opinion because what was happening Matt wasn't getting any services and then at that point we did find a doctor that they diagnosed him as having autistic spectrum disorder. So it is a long haha....huh...._ 

00:53:10
grief & relief 

00:53:15
TOM KINNEY What were your feelings at the time which you did finally get a diagnosis of autism? 

00:53:20
CHRIS BELLI Well I always knew I mean I've talked to lot of mom's and said "I knew" you know I knew I read and I read and I read and I...I always knew so I wasn't I was relieved finally when someone said this is what it is because it was like yeah I know. But initially you know I was very in a grief about it because I knew what could be one of the worst developmental disorders and I had no idea if he has a independent future. So I mean there is lot of grief periods, grief doesn't just happen at one time, it goes over and over and over and I still have my grief cycles that I go through. 

00:54:10
NANCY ALAR Well of course that was the usual mix of grief and relief because you grief at the child, your thought was there. I remember going to the daycare center where he had been as a normal child and walking by the door of the room where he was and they had little umbrellas on the door with all the children’s name and I snatched the umbrella with his name on off the door and tored into a thousand pieces and threw it away. He was no longer the normal child that I thought he was. 

00:54:40
TOM KINNEY Did you decide not to have another child because of... 

00:54:45
CHRIS BELLI Not I didn't but my... my husband at that time had decided not to and we've since become divorced. I mean I...I wouldn't say that the divorce was because of the...the extreme challenges that we had with Matt that I would say that it didn't help matters. 

00:55:10
NANCY ALAR So that was that grief, you know trying to come to grips with the fact that the child was not going to grow up and be like other kids. It was very sad for me on the other hand it was a very big relief because we finally had a name for what was wrong with him. 

00:55:25
TOM KINNEY Did you suspect that she was autistic before the diagnosis came in? 

00:55:30
LAURINE LUSK Actually a number of lay people told me who were not in the area of diagnosing disabilities, but they saw the signs and...and told me that's what they thought it was. So we actually went out searching for the diagnosis and I read a book by Temple Grandin, autism I think it's emergence labeled autism and as I read Temple Grandin's book, I kept a notepad next to me and whenever there was another characteristic that helped me to remember one of Megan's challenges I put on the notepad. By the time I finished reading the book, I had three pages filled. 

00:56:10
JAN SERAK Probably because that the time that we got it, it was finally actually I mean it's a combination of grief that you finally find out that yes he has a disability. It's gonna be a lifelong disability, but it's also tremendous relief that you finally have acknowledgment that yes you're not totally crazy and yes there are definitely is abnormal development and it has a label. 

00:56:40
LAURINE LUSK I've often heard that professional believe parent's can't take having the diagnosis of autism, but we embarrassed it because it made so much sense. 

00:56:45
JAN SERAK And I think you have to pass through him in the (inaudible ) say you've to pass through stages of grief. I mean you've to get over the fact that this is not you know this is not what you plan for your child. Okay this is what you have and he is a neat kid. He has great potential and as he is turning out he is a great kid and may be I wouldn't change the fact that he has autism because had he not had autism he wouldn't be who he is I guess. So you...you get passed and then you accept it and then you really like it sort of.... 

00:57:25
hyper-sensitivity 

00:57:25
TOM KINNEY Sometimes people with autism are very sensitive to loud noises or smell or certain types of foods, does that happen to you? 

00:57:35
CHRIS UMHOEFER Yes insensitive to very high-pitched noises like...like saws and drills or stuff like that, but low-pitched noises don't bother me as much. 

00:57:50
TOM UMHOEFER He had a definite sensitivity to high-pitched noises and he always hears stuff first you know what's that and what are you talking about. Then about a couple of minutes of later we would hear like a siren or something you know and oh that's what it was you know. 

00:58:05
NANCY ALAR Certain loud noises really upset him. He is very afraid of our vacuum cleaner at home. I have to always tell him when I'm about to turn it on and he will always go to a different part of the house and shut door and things so he can't hear it. He also had lots of trouble with fired alarms in schools and when someone was doing something like a construction project using a table saw or any of those types of equipment in school, he would have to be let around to a different place. 

00:58:35
LAURINE LUSK Well we noticed when Meg was a baby that whenever we go to a family reunion, the noise and all of the people milling around seem to be real upsetting to her and she would began crying at that reunion or that holiday gathering and not calm down. Sometimes nonstop crying for two to three days afterwards. 

00:59:00
CHRIS UMHOEFER And about smells I'm very sensitive to...to things that we normally consider bad smell especially smells of household cleaning substances like ammonia or chlorine, bleaching stuff like that. I don't like those. I also don't like the smell of when of diesel fuel. 

00:59:30
LAURINE LUSK She also had difficulty with baby food, if it had a texture or it smell she couldn't keep it down. She was very frightened of things like the vacuum cleaner, the blender, dogs barking. When she would go to a babysitter at daycare center when I pick her up often times we couldn't find her. She was so frightened of the other babies that were there that she would hide in the closet. 

00:59:55
LAURINE LUSK And I think that the babies, and animals, dogs and so on are unpredictable, move around, make noise, and so she was really terrified. 

01:00:05
CHRIS UMHOEFER But I do like the smell of things like... like foods that I like... like restaurants, smell like pizza or Hamburgers or stuff like that. As far as foods I'm kind of picky on them because I won’t eat foods with a certain type... with certain types of textures or tastes and the foods can't be too blend. 

01:00:35
MATT WARD Like most autistic people I have problems with my senses. Some loud noises are stressful for me, espec... especially things like... especially things like gunshots, loud motors and chainsaws. My mom took me to a driving car wash once when I was in Grade School and I was terrified. The brushes sound to me like the sound of machine gun fire. 

01:01:05
MATT FLICKINGER Well, it feels like... it feels like my ear is vibrating and... and it just doesn’t... it just doesn’t feel good. It's like my ear is just vibrating and it won’t stop, you know they haven’t. 

01:01:15
MATT WARD Over the past years I managed to train myself to tolerate some problem noises. But the possibility of unexpected loud noises is a constant source of low level anxiety for me. 

01:01:30
NANCY ALAR And he's also managed to, as he said, train himself some kind of mental conditioning that he's done for himself has enabled him to tolerate noises better than he used to. 

01:01:40
MATT WARD It is also painful for me to look at other people’s faces. Other people’s mouth and eyes are especially hard for me to look at. My lack of eye contact sometimes makes people, especially teachers, think I am not paying attention to them. I have been working with my mom and my teachers to come up with phrase to manage this eye contact problem. 

01:02:05
LAURINE LUSK I think with... people with autism they're in that readiness um... state because of their sensory system that they notice other people. So what I noticed with Megan was that she was in that anti-predator fight or flight um... level at all times. She was wondering what was gonna start on her next. And now she is becoming more mature. She is more able to control her behaviors and she has kind of a menu of ways to protect herself. She knows she can cover her ears. She knows that the dogs probably are not going to attack her. If she stands aground, they probably won’t bark. She knows that her screaming was probably what made them bark. So she’s been able to use her rational mind and her maturity to kind of cope with those same things today. But also we've... we have um... taught her about her nervous system and how to calm it down. So she has what we call a sensory diet with her at all times. On her school trapper keeper, she has a small bag (inaudible ) to it with a... a balloon that's been filled with flower that we call a koosh ball. She has a brush, she has a large rubber band that she can use um... to plan, to kind of led off some tension. She knows to get a drink. Um... lemon candies seem to be cool calming for her. So she'll use a lemon candy to calm herself down. So now whenever she gets nervous, she will independently use these things. But it took about five years to teach her to use them and to teach her how to regulate her own nervous system. We've learned so much from occupational therapist that’s specialized in the areas of sensory integration dysfunction. They evaluated Megan and they were able to diagnose exactly what set off her nervous system and what would calm it down. And my understanding is that every individual is different. These things that calm Megan down might be those things that set off another child’s nervous system. So um... I’ve been to many workshops, read lot of books, but mostly I remain a detective. I look at clues for Meg. 

01:04:25
splinter skills (and arcane interests) Megan Lusk 

01:04:30
LAURINE LUSK From the beginning we noticed splinter skills. We would um... talk to school people about her tremendous memory. Ah... she can remember every birthday and every holiday, who was there, what presents she received, what we ate for the meal. And when we would talk about those so-called splinter skills, um... we were told that um... they... they weren't relevant. And what I've come to know is that Megan couldn't perform at that high level with her memory if she didn’t have the IQ or the potential behind that skill and that… that was more of an indication of her ability than any IQ test ever could be. 

01:05:10
Mark Lusk 

01:05:15
SUSAN SCOTT She has some astronomically high splinter skills in the areas of reading, spelling, comprehension. Um... We suspect that Jennifer reads at a.. at an extremely fast pace and she also has a very high comprehension that goes with that. So on her last standardized testing of that sort, I think it was ah... last year that that occurred. She had some skills in the post four-year college range, so they were... they were shocking. 

01:05:45
JENNIFER SCOTT I write poetry. I have three whole notebooks and I'm studying on my fourth. Me... me on a cloud and I’ll show you many things. I’ll show you candy houses and horses that have wings. We’ll go to a place where the good times never end. I’ll do these things with you if you'd be my friend. 

01:06:25
SUSAN SCOTT Oh, I... we would love for Jennifer to go on to college. She certainly has the intellect to um... go on to college and ... and be quite successful in college. Ah... She'll need some supports again with the time management in the organization and we haven’t worked out the details. I actually don’t have a clue how that’s going to happen. But I'd love to see that happen. I would love for Jennifer to go... to be able to... to go to college. 

01:06:55
JENNIFER SCOTT Poetry expresses the way I feel towards certain stuff I guess. And I guess it's just kind of a wave. Well, it's an outlet and it really... it (inaudible) poetry, I would be in the net house by now. Just trust me on that. 

01:07:30
 (inaudible) technicals. I go to the one way to access, which is down by the airport and I go to the one downtown. 

01:07:35
CHRIS BELLI We noticed when he was very young that his mechanical skills were way out there. His dad is an electrical engineer and um... he used to... his dad would have this workshop with all sorts of radios and things like that that were you know kind of old radios and Matt would just go down there with a screwdriver and take 'em apart and put 'em back together. 

01:08:00
MATT FLICKINGER I have two classes going on right now and I took many others. Do you wanna hear the others? 

01:08:05
NARRATOR Yes. 

01:08:05
MATT FLICKINGER Well, the first class I took there was vocational math I and… and communications. Then I started taking um... vocational math II and human relation survey. Now I'm taking Word perfect intermediate for windows and windows 95. I did... I was taken Word perfect regular class. I passed that and I did very good. 

01:08:35
CHRIS BELLI Oh he was about two and a half and um... gosh what I said… His dad stuck with a gas station to get gas, very quickly came back and Matt had taken the speakers out of his push and his dad said put those speakers back in and he did. 

01:08:55
MATT FLICKINGER Well I was gonna become an architectural drafter when I... the very last point, but right now I'm considering doing data entry just to get warmed off for the classes. I mean for the job that... that I'm gonna be going to an architectural drafting. 

01:09:15
CHRIS BELLI So his mechanical skills are terrific and if I want anything to extract, I can definitely ask Matt to do it. His computer skills are very, very, very good too. He's always been um... not only interested, maybe obsessed towards computers and knows more about computers than the average person. Um... He did have a computer evaluation done as a matter of fact and he… he really um... what did they say now, they said that he did much better than the average graduate at college… or college graduate. 

01:09:50
TOM KINNEY How do you like going to college? 

01:09:55
MATT FLICKINGER I like going to college, it's wonderful because I feel like I accomplish things and I like being with the other kids. 

01:10:00
TOM KINNEY How… how do you like college in comparison to high school? 

01:10:05
MATT FLICKINGER Well, college is a very nice study-based place where they… where the kids are all the same and they treat you very nice. 

01:10:15
 Chad is a very bright child. He can retain information. Um... his qualities versus memory, the way he processes things is just at such lightening speed and... 

01:10:25
 What are the some of the things you like to do in your spare time? 

01:10:30
 Mainly tell him about what you do all night? 

01:10:30
CHAD HAYCROFT I am not saying that. 

01:10:35
 Chad, one thing I would say, Chad... 

01:10:35
CHAD HAYCROFT You can say I play a computer, but not the games. 

01:10:40
 Yeah, Chad is ... what I'm just gonna explain to them that Chad is very ah... now I'd like to use the word secretive. But he um... there are certain things about his life he does not like to share, but I would say there is something that Chad really truly enjoys and he does it best when he's... there is no distractions and he used to stay up all night, his whole clock will shift, so he’d be up all night go to school, sleep from 4 to 11, do his thing (inaudible ) what it is, go to school and come back. Chad (inaudible ) in the computer industry somewhere and that there is, you know, a lot of people out there that ah... you know they... they work in their own projects, so socialization is a real key thing and as long as you don't measure people with other people, their happiness, Chad is very, very happy child in... in what he does. He's very futuristic and he thought that some day he actually did a design of a teleporter under water that people would go through that… 

01:11:40
CHAD HAYCROFT (inaudible ) 

01:11:45
 Once every phone (inaudible ) I thought this is good too, because I think we can really use this. 

01:11:50
CHAD HAYCROFT No. We can't. 

01:11:50
 We can’t. What is of mind programming to our people who would not steal? 

01:11:55
CHAD HAYCROFT Will you stop it? 

01:11:55
 Okay. I just thought that it would be good. That’s some good stuff. 

01:12:00
CHAD HAYCROFT> STOP REFRESHING MY INFORMATION.  

01:12:00
 Oh, yeah, that’s the whole key. He does not want me give his information, so I gotta be careful there. 

01:12:05
Maurice Johnson 

01:12:05
 Maurice loves music. He loves to dance and he is a good one. As he got older, he seemed to have calmed down quite a bit. Actually he's a very good basketball player you know. He sort of finds that one spot on the basket ball court and he just (inaudible ). 

01:12:27
TOM UMHOEFER Definitely math, ah... and sciences, ah... he can catch on to things really quick. Um... and I think that um... is almost a determent at school because it gets boring form and the rest of the kids are kind of catching up. Ah... ah... computer programming I think he can be a good programmer. He is very interested in game programming, video games. Um... I don’t know how to present him into that, but I think he would be very good at that. 

01:13:00
CHRIS UMHOEFER I wanna learn how to program video games. 

01:13:05
TOM KINNEY Is that kind of an area of career that you would like to go into? 

01:13:05
CHRIS UMHOEFER Yes. 

01:13:10
TOM KINNEY And what... what actually would you like to do? 

01:13:10
CHRIS UMHOEFER I'd like to be able to make my own video games and sell them and make some money of it. 

01:13:20
TOM KINNEY Have you ever done... had any experience in doing anything like that? 

01:13:25
CHRIS UMHOEFER Like I’ve started programming... practicing programming in Q basic. 

01:13:35
NANCY ALAR He taught himself origami when he was nine. We didn’t even know he was doing it. 

01:13:40
MATT WARD With the help of various origami books I graduated from Queens(ph) to other figures. I can now make many kinds of animals and the most complex geometric models. I like the geometric models best because they have more math. 

01:13:55
NANCY ALAR We had some craft books in the house and he would pull them off periodically and look through them and we didn’t know why he was doing it. We just sort of didn't pay any attention. And one week he was in the corner by where these craft books were and we thought he was working on one of his Legos that was giving him a problem because everyone (inaudible) I'll never get it right, I can't do it, I'll never get it right and calm down man you will be fine and we thought he was working on Lego and one day he walked out of the corner and he was holding the crane. He was holding an origami crane. But also he has moved on to other things, so he doesn’t really like to do origami that much anymore. 

01:14:35
NANCY ALAR Last year he got interested in the gods of Egypt. Who knows why? And we don’t know where this came from. This absolute intense interest in hairless dogs and that has... we don’t why hairless dogs, but my husband and I are cat people. We have a hairless dog now. 

01:15:00
support groups 

01:15:05
TOM KINNEY How was home life like with a young child with autism. 

01:15:10
CHRIS BELLI Overwhelming um... parts of it yeah today I've forgotten and repressed because there was just so overwhelming. Um... there was a constant ah... constant when the behavior problems were there and the... the whipping and screaming and the running and totally out of control and... and... and you know smearing feces on the wall and um... no toileting. Um... It was... it was just unbelievable. 

01:15:40
LAURINE LUSK I found that there were times when parents are so overwhelmed. Just to get through the day is enough and to get out to a support group meeting can be kind of tough. The support group meetings that I’ve been to that are most effective are the ones that are fun along with informational and emotionally supportive. 

01:16:00
CHRIS BELLI And I think the worst part for me was isolation, then I felt um... I didn’t do a really good job at connecting. Like right now they have you know the support groups. Um... but I think you know when Matt was young too, they really didn’t have as many resources as they do now. Um... but I isolated myself because some of my relatives didn’t understand or the friends or the neighbors ah... didn’t really want their kids to be with Matt because Matt would hurt them. And we kind of became the odd people in the neighborhood and it hurt and it just made things a lot worse than they were. 

01:16:45
JAN SERAK It's very difficult when you have friends who have all normal children that always don’t understand you know the background and what you go through as a parent. So meeting and being able to talk about um... some of the challenges that you go through and... and also finding resources. 

01:17:00
LAURINE LUSK I have been involved in support groups throughout Megan's life. Some of them I’ve started when we lived in rural areas and... and we've been able to invite a... a small number of families and sometimes it has been just another parent and I um... study in the coffee path waiting for others that did not come and just talking ourselves. 

01:17:25
JAN SERAK We have a monthly coffee that’s either... well it's actually every… every first Thursday of the month, parents know that they can come to coffee and it's fathers, um... parents, caregivers, grandparents, here and there we'll have community um... resource person that come along that’s really anybody that wants to come and talk about autism. 

01:17:50
TOM KINNEY Was that helpful for you when you first went (inaudible )? 

01:17:55
JAN SERAK Yes, I finally felt like I came home and people understood and I... I'll never forget going to my first function that was a family function because that we had gone to... my husband and I had gone to a couple of evening meetings where the other parents were there, but we had not gone to... So I still had not ever seen another child with autism until I went to that first autism society picnic. 

01:18:20
[sil.] 

01:18:30
JAN SERAK And I'll never forget um... you know seeing all these kids running around and I just sat there, you know tears running down my cheeks because I thought oh, here are some other kids that are acting just like my... my son. 

01:18:45

01:18:50
TOM KINNEY This video features auticulate young people who offer insight into issues important to them. This isn’t to imply that all who have the diagnosis of autism have their expressive abilities but it does suggest many have great potential and it's our challenge as parents and educators to see it and realize. 

01:19:10
 Get to a support group. Don’t read anything older than two years of inform... resource information because all the old information is scary. Support each other and have fun and laugh. I mean that’s a big thing. You have to find the fun things in life. You have to do things for yourself and not be totally consumed with just feeling with your child because if you are not strong to yourself, you are not going to be strong for your child.
