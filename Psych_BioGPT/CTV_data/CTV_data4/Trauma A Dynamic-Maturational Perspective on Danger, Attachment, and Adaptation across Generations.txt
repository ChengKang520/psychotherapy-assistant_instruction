DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE LIVE: BOSTON SEAPORT WORLD TRADE CENTER 

00:00:00
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK I like to keep my introductions brief because whatever people have to say is much better than what I could say about them. Uhm, so our next speaker was here quite a while ago Pat Crittenden. 

00:00:10
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN Hi. 

00:00:10
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uhm, who has been, ah, independent attachment researchers studies with Mary Ainsworth, uhm, and, has developed her own developmental ba-- maturational model of attachments. Uhm, the person who urged me to re-invite Pat in particularly was Mark Schwartz who said I just did a workshop with Pat Crittenden, "Do you know her?" I said, "Yes, she's fantastic." He said, "She's fantastic." There's a lot of new stuff. He said, "I'm gonna get in touch with her and want to meet her again." So he is-- and so he, ah, now, you can tell your story yourself. Uhm, Pat Crittenden.

Patricia Crittenden, Ph.D. 

00:01:05
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN He left me notes on who I am. Hopefully I'll be able to remember. Thank you Bessel. It's really nice to be back both to your series of conferences but also back to the US. It's about 20 years since I've done much in the US. And so let me-- the plan for today for my period here is to talk a bit about DMM attachment theory, Dynamic Maturational Model of Attachment & Adaptation, attachment theory as related to trauma. To touch on a few empirical findings that will allow me present a case. Uhm, and it will use the adult attachment interview coded with the DMM method not with Main and Goldwyn and the CARE-- and a CARE-Index video. So you'll see a little bit of the mother's discourse and then you'll see her in interaction with her child. And then I'll talk a little bit about treatment implications from that. So, here's the tough part, to try in about a half an hour to give you an overview of an alternate perspective on attachment theory. It's a... 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN You have more than hour. 

00:02:35
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN Right, right but in a half an hour I give you an overview of the theory then I do the case. I got this all planned Bessel. You just wasted 15 seconds. 

00:02:55
[sil.] 

00:03:00
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN Ah, so, this is a strengths approach to anxious attachment. Maybe I need to say that again. It's a strengths approach to anxious attachment. It's what's good about anxious attachment. I'm going to propose that exposure to danger is an opportunity, you see, already I've got the whole model upside down to learn essential information about survival. Hmm, if life weren't dangerous, you wouldn't need to know this, but life is. Is it good? 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN Yeah! 

00:03:50
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN Uhm, I'm giving chuckles up here in the front row. I-- I'm gonna be talking a foreign language throughout. On the surface it will sound like English but I want to differentiate danger from psychological trauma by saying danger is universal. There are no lives that are free of danger. It's an event. Psychological trauma is a response to the exposure to danger. Not everyone who is danger is traumatized. Psychological pain signals that there is something to learn. Yes it hurts but it signals, there is something here to learn, get busy, do your work. And some per-- people experienced trauma and others don't. You know, it Alan said. I'm just capitalizing on that. The outcomes of psychological trauma are either unnecessary re-endangerment by people who said, "Oh, no, no, that didn't bother me. I was okay." And they don't learn anything that could prevent the next problem or excessive anxiety about unlikely endangerment. They're focused all the time on a-- and improvable event. I'm gonna give you a dynamic maturational model of attachment and adaptation. It's a theory about the effects of danger and sex. We're not gonna talk much about sex even though sexual abuse will come up in the case that I'm going to present. But the theory itself is based upon the importance of survival and reproduction. So, sex is in there from the beginning. On self-partner and child protection. And I'm going to argue that development enables individuals to learn to manage increasingly complex dangers. So, some of what Alan uncovered in his wonderful longitudinal study is that it matters when things happen. Very simple dangers can be accommodated by the infant mind, but some kinds of dangers cannot if they occurred later they could be accommodated by the preschooler's mind or the school-age child or the adolescent. But when certain kinds of dangers occur will affect the ability of the individual to make sense of what they have experienced. Increasingly, the DMM has become an information processing model. It's-- it has the behavioral attachment strategies component absolutely but increasingly we are focused on information processing. So, we start with the brains evolved to give preferential attention to danger and sex but we're not doing sex today, but don't forget it for a minute. And that when the brain receives stimulation, there are two basic processing roots available to it. One is a cerebellar, cognitive, temporally ordered root, all of behaviorism is built on this root. Uhm, and cognitive treatments are built on this processing root, I'm gonna call it cognition or cognitive and that's a restricted meaning of the word cognitive. It's restricted to causal interpretations based upon the predictable temporal order of events, behaviorism. And then there is a limbic affective. 

00:08:20
[sil.] 

00:08:25
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN And process either the temporal order in which the stimulation was received, cognitive information, or the intensity of the stimulation at a moment as compared to the previous moment, and that's affective root. And they are processed differently through the brain. Then, I want to look at levels of awareness. Some information is held preconsciously. We know but we are unaware of knowing. Infants have only preconscious information. Some information is processed verbally. Preschool-aged children begin to get verbal information, school-age children can do more with verbal information than can preschoolers. And by the time we reach adolescence and adulthood, we can do some pretty fancy things with it. And... 

00:09:25
[sil.] 

00:09:35
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN Memory systems to which I have added a little bit. I have a deep belief in symmetry, truth and beauty overweigh everything else. They certainly overweigh citations and so when I mapped out Tulving and Schacter's work, there were couple holes. And to have symmetry, I needed to fill them and I did. Uhm, the idea is that we have multiple dispositional representations. Most of you probably speak of inner working models. This is my transformation of that idea to dispositional representations. And I'm sort of building on Damasio's work to get it this more neurological understanding of what is representation. And there's my simple outline. 

00:10:40
[sil.] 

00:11:05
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN Ride a bike. If you put it in words, you fall off, it isn't fast enough but you know how to do it. How to drive your car to work without thinking about anything but you don't hit the cars, you respond to the stoplights' procedure all night. It's what you do without even thinking. As you as you get the sensory stimulation, the muscles in your body know what to do and you don't put it in words and you don't think about it. And image memory, the sensory images, sight, sound, smell, touch, taste that have meaning of safety or danger, more of the possibility of sex for you. And then the verbalized forms of the same information. The one that interests me the most for what I'll need to say later is semantic memory which is the generalizations about the procedures that you use and these generalizations usually come with the word always or never, or even always or always never, a very, very, really, really. They tend to put things in absolute terms specially when they are learned early in life. As we get older, we become capable of conditional kinds of semantic statements instead of saying my mother is always loving which people who use a Type A dismissing strategy are likely to do. We say, "Well, my mother is usually loving but when she's had a really hard day and she has headache and she has that look on her face, you better watch out." And so now we set up contin-- uhm, contingent? That wasn't that word-- conditional. Uhm, conditional semantic statements that more accurately capture the range of experience we have had, that's the one I want to speak, connotative language. That wasn't in Tulving and Schacter, that's mine. Uhm, I'm an old English major you see and I know that the way we use language influences what we will buy, who we will vote for. Uhm, connotative language is a very powerful way of communicating words. It conveys the affect and I put it into my model. Uhm, the integrative forms of representations are episodic memory and reflective integration. So, that leads to three protection attachment strategies, the cognitive Type A's who avoid danger, who inhibit the things that could elicit danger. And in my model, might compulsively do the things that would prevent danger. The affective Type C's who fight or struggle with the danger or with the source of danger. So they preoccupy on it rather than dismissing it. And it balanced our integrative B's who consider the information about the danger and resolve the problem. You didn't see the words secure there. That's because I prefer the information processing approach to the behavioral approach. And when you do that, it becomes possible for the mind to be balanced and integrated when the body in its context is not safe. So this allows me to have people like Nelson Mandela as B's when nothing in his history would have suggested, he could have felt secure, but he certainly was balanced and integrative. It takes behavior or your immediate context apart from the processing of the mind. 

00:15:25
DMM Protective Strategies ▪ Connect behavior to information processing ▪ Providing the basis for connecting strategies to neurological organization of CNS ▪ Using a gradient of transformations of information to predict - danger/safety - distress/comfort 

00:15:30
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN These DMM protective strategies connect behavior to information processing and that provides the basis for connecting the strategies to the neurological organization of the central nervous system through using a gradient of transformations of information. Ah, we're sort of going to look at those to predict danger and safety, distress and comfort. This is the model I use, this is my model of attachment strategies. 

00:16:05
Attachment Protective Strategies 

00:16:10
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN Mark, did you show it yesterday? I don't know where you are. 

00:16:15
UNKNOWN No, he didn't. 

00:16:15
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN No, he didn't. All right. Well, he said he spoke about this and he could have. Uhm, this is how the model looks. And here are the cognitively organized Type A dismissing or avoidant strategies but rather than stopping A1-2, I have A3's and 4's. Uhm, I'm gonna try to tie this to some of the examples that Alan gave and Alan and I may or may not remember them well enough. You changed the names if you think I need to do that. I think an A4 which is compulsive compliance in its mild form, A4 minus is compulsive performance. And he gave you an example of a girl named AC who was very popular but always felt uncertain whether she was doing the right thing, whether she was doing good enough, whether people would really like her if they knew her. And my guess is, that we are looking at something that's very common in the United States. Compulsive performance, I have to perform, perform, perform, do, do, do and the minute I don't do, then everyone will know who I really am and what my limitations are and then I won't be good anymore. And if you're in this room, there's a chance, there's a chance. But if you're not, then you're probably an A3 compulsive ca-- caregiver because most mental health providers are compulsive caregivers. It's an anxious strategy, uhm, for sure but it fills a role in society. And I want to argue that every strategy has its upside and its limitation. Every strategy has a context where it is the best solution but it has context where it's an endangering solution. All right, those are the A's, here come the C's, the preoccupied, once I'm a color coded woman. I'm not only balanced on my visuals, I'm color coded. Green will always mean Type C. Uhm, and I put the information processing there but don't look at that right now. Just notice that I have an array of strategies that, that don't exist in the A, B, C, D model. Those strategies that are above this red line present very little risk of psychopathology. Those strategies that are between these two line present considerable risk of mild to moderate psychopathology. No certainty of it, the word was risk, certainty isn't part of life. And below the black line, you're starting to look at people who may be found in residential settings like prisons, locked psychiatric wards. These are people who don't do very well on the outside, and if they're on the outside, there are risk for harming themselves or others. Attachment figures primarily parents. But I really Alan that you mentioned those important teachers. I think they rescue a couple of kids with really bad histories. Uhm, one might even be thought giving this talk. She can remember the teacher. Uhm, children cannot manager most dangerous. Attachment figures protect and comfort children in the child zone of proximal development. That means, they let the child do for himself what he can do. And they help them to learn when he is ready to learn. And they protect and comfort him when the child cannot do these things. Well, the zone of proximal development is always changing. Hence, the parent needs to be sensitive to what their child can and cannot do and is ready to learn with the parent to and they need to respond in a way that is consistent with that knowledge. I'm trying to pick on Ainsworth's two words, sensitively responsive. When parents are not in the child's zone of proximal development, Type A children find that the parent expected too much and they punished failure or the display of negative feelings. And the child learns to inhibit negative affect and negative behavior. They may learn compulsively, I didn't put this in cuz the model is complex and-- I say it. Uhm, then they may learn to compulsively display the behavior that the parent wants to see and will reward. So, smiling can often function to prevent mothers from withdrawing or becoming angry. I reminded of a little, uhm, recognized finding of Ainsworth and Tracy, that the mothers of the Type A babies kiss them the most and held them the least. There are, there are false signs of happiness that, that are commonly used among us. Uhm, and, and too good to be true is not true. I am consistently worried about the over performers the two happy people, the excessively positive group. 

00:22:30
[sil.] 

00:22:35
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN Oh, it wasn't a joke. Type C children have parents that are intermittently unpredictively positively reinforcing the child's negative affect or immature behavior, straight behavioral statement. And the child learns to express negative affect and behavior more frequently and with exaggeration. 

00:23:00
When Parents Are Not in the ZPD ▪ Type A child: ▪ Parent expected too much and punished failure/negative feelings ▪ Child learns to inhibit negative affect & behavior ▪ Too good to be true ▪ Type C child: ▪ Parent has intermittently & unpredictably rewarded 'immature' , negative behavior ▪ Child learns to express negative affect & behavior with exaggeration ▪ Too bad to be true 

00:23:00
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN And I would argue that when the child is too bad, it's not true either, that are most acting out children are doing this because it's what they've learned is the way to negotiate with other people. And we should think of it as an interpersonal property not as a personal characteristic of the child and proceed immediately to medicate him down. Uhm, danger and psychological trauma. Danger creates the opportunity to learn, to protect and comfort the self. Unprotected and uncomforted children use psychological shortcuts that omit the incomprehensible information or change its meaning. They use a shortcut and that's how I'm going to refer to it, a psychological shortcut. They talk too threatening and complex information away where it can be found later if it's needed but it isn't in your face, you don't notice it. Uhm, maturation creates the opportunity for the mind to reorganize the dispositional representations, the DR's, with the attachment figures help. So, if I go back to your Mike(ph) Alan to try to build some bridges across what you have just heard, Mike(ph) was a secure infant, his parents divorced somewhere in late childhood. I'm looking for a confirmation that they got the history. Uhm, and then his died shortly after he tried to get some distance from her. Had he had an attachment figure who could talk with him about this process of divorce and how it hurt her and how it hurt him, and how it hurt his father. And manage that over the next decade of Mike's growing up. He would have been able to handle this divorce in the best way that one can handle an uncomfortable situation. But he not only didn't have that. Most parents aren't able to, to-- speak coherently with their children about their divorces. They're either to caught in the fight or to ready to move forward, and then of course his mother died. And there was no one to do that talking through in a developmentally changing way with him. So, here's the model. 

00:25:45
DMM Strategies in Infancy 

00:25:50
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN These are the infant strategies with the exception of the dark red and the dark green and the little AC in the middle. These are the Ainsworth patterns. The, the differences are, that they have been connected to one another. They put-- been put in a dimensional space which is what I did in my dissertation under Mary Ainsworth in which you look at the first version of the circle and it's changed seven or eight times over the years. But when she looked at that first rough version, you can see this is the beginning of a circle, we're gonna get the whole thing. Uhm, she said, "I always knew A and C came together and I knew they were connected." The other thing which is different here is B3 as comfortable. When Ainsworth and I were working on the preschool assessment that I developed, the PAA, she gave B3 the name comfortable and I really li-- it opened up-- when people know how to choose their words, they open up whole lines of thought. And the addition of comfort than comfortable for B3's to the model allowed me to start thinking about anxiety and arousal in a whole new way. We're not going to discuss it but they, they just opened windows that hadn't been there before. AC was my dissertation, maltreated children is sometimes using A strategy, sometimes uses C strategy in a flexible way that makes themself-- makes them safe moment to moment in a changing environment, a maltreating home. And then the pre-compulsives and pre-coercives and we can already see them in infancy although they are not yet able to mount a full strategy. Sorry. They used truly predictive cognitive information and truly predictive negative affect and the infant mind cannot do too much more than that. 

00:28:05
DMM Strategies in the Preschool Years 

00:28:10
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN But the preschool mind is able to mount false positive affect to give positive affect, bright, shining, uhm, may remains turn would be over bright smiles in the face of internal discomfort and that was where we developed the full compulsive care giving and compulsive compliant strategies including the milder form compulsive performance where love is used as the outcome to shape behavior. "Mommy loves you when you do this." Uhm, and the C3 and 4, the aggressive and feigned helpless strategies. I know, it's a new language, I'm sorry. But surely, you have someone that you know who is a feigned helpless. You know they can do it but they whinged until you do it for them. Uhm, in the school years, when false cognition becomes possible. False cognition is arranging the temporal order of events to lead other people to the probable conclusion which is the opposite of what you intend. 

00:29:25
DMM Strategies in the School Years 

00:29:25
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN So the child who intends to steal behaves like a child who does not intend to steal puts people at ease and it is when they are at ease that the shop keeper takes her eye off this child cuz she knows he's gonna buy an item after he's made a selection and she starts looking for the thieves. He is the thief. And he is very neatly arranged the contingencies so that he does not look-- that's false cognition. And that gives us the C5-6 strategies punitive and seductive. If you want an example, an adult example of a C6, I hope you still remember her. Princess Diana is a perfect example of all aspects of this seductive, obsessed with revenge, uhm, excuse me. Obsessed with rescue strategy where the C5 is punitive obsessed with revenge, that's the bully strategy, the gang strategy. I'm just trying to paint some picture in your mind of what kinds of people we'd want to think about. In adolescence, we get A5, compulsively promiscuous, and A6 compulsively self-reliant. If you've read your Bowlby very carefully you know he talked about compulsive caregivers. He talked about compulsive self-reliance. 

00:31:00
DMM Strategies in Adolescence 

00:31:00
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN I've just put them into the model giving them the information processing that underlies them and put them in developmentally where I think they, they show up. And this is the full model where you have A7, delusional idealization of a dangerous attachment figure. This would be the hostage syndrome. All right. If you go to another literature we have this already. Uhm, externally assembled self, that's an iatrogenic pattern. It's someone who has no inner sense of self. They only know what they've been told about themselves by the various professionals who have taken them from one foster home to another, move them from one institution, ah, ah, to another. I've never seen this in home-reared children, it is iatrogenic, we create it. Uhm, on the C side, we have, uhm, menacing and paranoid. Uhm, the belief that all the world is against you and that you have the power to conquer it. Ah, we've recently had a president who is near this pattern. Depending upon your politics that was funny or I won't get out of here alive. Uhm, and at, at very bottom, you have the people who can use all the transformations of information. They can deny what they need to deny. They can create the delusion that they need to create, they can show false cognition, false affect and they are extremely good at understanding other people's minds. They have a very good theory of mind so that they organized their behavior around what they believe that you know about them so as to create the most believable false self that is possible given what you know and the extent to which they know that you know it. So that's psychopathy down at the bottom. I now have a dimensional model where horizontally we are looking at which source of information, cognition or affect is predominant in your thinking and vertically the degree of integration of, of the information. So, psychological trauma in childhood. Unprotected and uncomforted danger in childhood lead I believe to psychological shortcuts. The mind has to make an explanation for what to do next when it can't understand what has happened. And so it-- will mix the information, it can't cope with and that makes the information that is left more perfect, less variable. And now we have the absolute understanding of what is necessary under different conditions, psychological shortcuts. And if that is combined with lack of reorganization during development, and development should be a constant reorganizing process. As children become more aware of variation and able to integrate it into their understanding, their dispositional representations should always be changing. But those who have been exposed to danger and were not protected and were not comforted, stay with the old where absolute models and do not dare to challenge by exploring more variegated understandings. Okay. Uhm, and that create psychological trauma in childhood. The shortcuts then predispose adults to PTSD from danger that occurs in adulthood. They are over attributing danger in some circumstances under attributing it in other circumstances and making the shortcut doesn't allow them to put everything in its temporal and spatial and relational context in the present. So, just a couple of surprising empirical findings. This is not an attempted a-- full review of the literature. I want to get on to this case. A very recently published article looked at more 6,000 studies of treatment of trauma and found that only 22 met the scientific criteria for inclusion in their review. Data very similar to this have been published for a review of treatment of sexual offenders. And when I look at these two exhaustive attempts to look at efficacy outcomes and find that the overwhelming majority of published findings are not considered scientifically sound in the methodology. I'm really dismayed. I'm really, really dismayed. Think of the effort that has been lost. I'm coding data now for a study of, uhm, postnatal depression. And as we are coding, we think there are no effects. We've got-- I, I don't know which case is which. I only know we have mixed set of cases in controls and pre-imposed, uhm, interactions. And we don't see any that fall out of the risk range. I don't think this data will get published. I think when the investigators get back this data that their intervention didn't change the probabilities of risk. I don't think they will publish and I know other studies like that. Investigators like to support their interventions. Uhm, of the 22, none showed substantial effects on children's trauma. The Six CBT studies showed short-term relief of one symptom. Medication had detrimental effects. Let's hear it for that. Then a couple of empirical findings from the DMM. Adults with chronic PTSD based on an adult attachment interview had unresolved childhood traumas. Most of the traumas were in a dismissed form, not a preoccupation with the trauma but a dismissal of it, dismissed effects, displaced feelings, blocked and denied events, and delusional repairs. Adult PTS traumas were tied to childhood trauma that is the past event and the current event had something similar. Something that would-- and it was usually image. Something that would tip off that old memory that the individual was not thinking about. And then in another study, mothers with Borderline Personality Disorder had more secure semantic models of their children on the working model of the child interview than normative mothers. They always love their children. They always would do the right thing, always, always, always. And when coded by the coders that Zeno(ph) had trained, they came out as more secure than the normative sample. Semantic information is the easiest to falsify. 

00:39:30
Background ideas for case study • Danger & psychological trauma are different. • Danger that is explained by comforting attachment figures is unlikely to yield trauma. • Dangers that yield trauma are likely to be complex, i.e., parent & self contributions, positive aspects. • Familial and repeated traumas are likely to have roots in attachment figures' trauma. • Psychological trauma has many forms that differ in: - Psychological process (dismissed & preoccupying forms) - Degree of conscious accessibility • The dismissed & preconscious forms of trauma will have greater impact on traumatized adults' children. 

00:39:30
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN Uhm, so here are the background ideas for this case study, danger and psychological trauma are different. Danger that is explained by comforting attachment figures is unlikely to yield trauma. Dangers that yield trauma are likely to be complex, such as the parent and the self-contributing to the problem or the problem having positive aspects to it when we find it offensive. Here, I'm really referring to child sexual abuse. Familial and repeated traumas are likely to have roots in attachment figures' trauma going back a generation. And psychological trauma has many forms that differ in the psychological process used, the dismissed cognitive process or the preoccupying affective process, the degree of conscious accessibility and the dismissed and preconscious forms of trauma will have greater impact on, on, uhm, adults' parenting behavior that really should be great impact. Okay. So the case is Cecilia and Diego. Cecilia is a young woman who is now and at the time we collect the data in a mother-baby foster placement. Uhm, I was asked to evaluate her readiness to care for Diego independently, to leave the foster placement with her child. And I used this attachment assessment, the AAI coded with this circular model for the mother and the CARE-Index for the dyad. So, this is the information I'm going to be giving you. We're gonna look at the AAI first. Everyone knows what an AAI is? Can't tell? All right. It's a 1-hour... 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN No. 

00:41:40
AAI & DMM discourse analysis • Adult Attachment Interview • 1-hour, semi-structured interview • About childhood danger, protection, & comfort. • Discourse analysis • Yields self-protective ABC attachment strategy • Unresolved traumas & type of distortion. 

00:41:40
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN It's a 1-hour semi-structured interview about childhood danger protection and comfort. It begins with very simple questions. Tell me who your family was. Did you have grandparents? In our version, what is the first thing you can remember? Tell me about your relationship with your parent. Give me some episodes that show that it was like you said it was. And then it goes in to some of the dangers can happen. Were you ever left with no one to take care of you? Were your parents ever af-- uhm, angry with each other and you ask for episodes about these, uhm, and it concludes with the integrative questions. How is that affected your adult personality? In our version, how is that affected the partner you selected? Uhm, what does it have to do with how you're gonna raise child-- integrative questions. And then we use a discourse analysis on the transcribed interview. And that yields the self-protective ABC attachment strategy off of this whole round model that I gave you. So A1 to eight, C1 to eight, B1 to five and various AC's. It also yields unresolved traumas and the type of distortion that is being used when that traumatic event is spoken of. And we have 12 types of unresolved trauma. For Type A, dismissed versus Type C preoccupied, displaced imagi-- imagined. The event is real. What the individual imagines is the impact of the event upon themselves. Uhm, vicarious trauma, suggested trauma, this is of course usually suggested by a therapist. Blocked or denied traumas, hinted traumas. This is usually associated with a very high C's, C5, 6, 7, and 8 where the individual is building a case for why someone else might have done the bad thing in question. Uhm, the clearest one I can remember is dad died falling down the stairs. And Barry(ph) who tells the story in his AAI gives you all the information to allow you to think, mother pushed him. But Barry(ph) never says, "Mother pushed him." That would involve an investigation and now you'd have to prove your assertions by hinting you caused the listener to arrive at the false conclusion. Uhm, delusional repair of the trauma, delusional revenge for the trauma and then states of depression and disorganization around the trauma. Uhm, you work in a country where attachment is generally ABC and disorganized. This is the only place left in my model where there is disorganization as one subtype of unresolved trauma otherwise I find patterns to be organized strategies for dealing with dangerous circumstances. So, I'm gonna give you an excerpt from Cecilia's AAI. When I say distant it's like she had this boyfriend, Big Bob, who was lovely and he used to go, he had kids with another woman. And he used to go and see them every single Sunday. And the way I say, mean by distant is that particular-- one particular Sunday, she decide-- my mum decided not to come back. So Big Bob couldn't go to and see his kids cuz he wouldn't leave us and he hadn't been with m-- my mum that long and my mum decided not to come back, so I sort of mean that by distant, was the fact that sometimes she just wasn't there. And I don't remember it personally in a way, it's from what I have been told by Big Bob cuz he ca--he err-- is friends with my uncle. And he came round and he was like, "Yeah well, I wouldn't have left your mum, but she didn't come back until the Fr-- Thursday-- err no Tuesday," I went, "Right." She goes, she goes-- and she had left, left you and she had left, left you for like three nights or whatever? Cuz she went out on the Friday, came back on the Tuesday-- err, I was like "Right." And she goes-- he knew-- she knew I was meant to be seeing my kids on the Sunday and she never came back when she promised she would, uhm, and she had left him apparently with no money and there was hardly any food in the house-- so. So that's what she said. The discourse analysis is, when I say distant it's like she had this boyfriend which is distancing. Sorry, that should be red. Big Bob, who was lovely which idealizes him. And he used to go-- and this is disfluent as she breaks it off. He had kids with another woman. And he used to go and see them every single emphatic, Sunday. And the way I say-- mean by distant is and that's disfluent, that particular, one particular Sunday she decide-- that's disfluent. My mum decided not to come back, so Big Bob-- and that displaces the effect of the mother's abandonment of the speaker onto the boyfriend Big Bob. Couldn't go to and see his kids cuz he wouldn't leave us which is distancing and he hadn't been with m-- very disfluent about saying her mother's name-- that long ago. And my mum decided not to come back, sharp stop. Sorry, that should be in red as well. So I sort of mean that, that's vague by distant, was the fact that distancing, that sometimes minimizing, she just wasn't there and the omitted words are for me. It's set up as if it were for Big Bob. And I don't remember it personally in a way, distancing and vague. It's from what I have been told by Big Bob cause he ca-- he err-- very disfluent-- is friends with my uncle and he came round and he was like, "Yeah, well, I wouldn't have left your mum, but she didn't come back until after the Fr-- Thu-- very, very disfluent about mother's going and coming. And I went, "Right" and this speech, she's talking to us in dialogue which is enlivening, brings it into the present. And she goes present tense, and she had left, left you for like three nights or whatever and that's dismissing cuz she went right out on the Fri-- she went out on the Friday, came back on the Tuesday repeats this important information of mother leaving. Err-- I was like "Right" and she goes-- she knew-- it's a confusion of time and person. Her speech is really breaking down here and we're not gonna be able to make much sense of it. Uhm, she knew I was meant to be seeing my kids on the Sunday and she never came back when she promised she would-- present tense, speech, and, and she had left him, displaced again, apparently with no money and there was hardly any food in the house--so. So I was abandoned to a strange man and had no one else to take care of me. That's what she didn't say. And we treat that as an unresolved trauma in a displaced and dismissed form around abandonment. Here's the second excerpt. Like my mom and my step dad would argue and fight and we had a dog who was gorgeous and she was very nervous around loud noises. And they would start fighting and she would be shaking behind the sofa and I would go, "Mum, you are scaring the dog," and they would go, "Get her the fuck out of here then!" So I would end up having to take the dog for like a 2-hour walk or whatever because they were arguing. And here's the annotation. Like my mom and my step dad would argue and fight and we had a dog who was gorgeous. Shift to dog. We're displacing the story now. And she was very nervous around loud noises, displaces her own distress onto the dog. And they would start fighting, and this is the present participle which is making it more nearly in the present. And she would be shaking present participle again and displaced onto dog behind the sofa and I would go, "Mum, you are scaring the dog," which is speech and displaced caregiving to dog and they would go, "Get her the fuck out of here then!" And now we have violent and scatological language. So I would end up having to take the dog for like a 2-hour walk or whatever which is dismissing because-- sorry, EC they, uhm, that should be in red as well, erroneous cognition. The because is going to give us the answer to why and this is an erroneous answer, because they were like arguing. And I say the dog functions as a means of escape from an almost present tense danger. And we treat that as U-trauma displaced regarding marital fights. So we end up after we've coded the whole AAI with Cecilia's attachment strategy being unresolved trauma in a displaced and dismissed form regarding abandonment by our mother and unresolved trauma in a displaced form under the dog regarding marital fights. In an-- Type A strategy that has components of caregiving, compliance and delusional idealization in it. I really wanted to be chemist. So, there's the still that I didn't want you to focus on too much. Uhm, the questions. Did the baby hit Cecilia aggressively? 

00:52:50
UNKNOWN No. 

00:52:50
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN No. Did he hurt her? 

00:52:55
UNKNOWN No. 

00:52:55
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN No. Did Cecilia perceive pain? 

00:53:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:53:00
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN Yes. Did she expect to be hit? 

00:53:05
UNKNOWN No. 

00:53:05
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN I would argue that she is hyper vigilant to the possibility of being hit that she will capture all the occasions when she could be hit and many occasions when no one is hitting her. She is over attuned to being hit. And her perception of being hit aggressively by Diego is a delusion. It didn't happen but she has behaved as if it was. And I would tell you that it is an affectively image delusion that when she sees rapid movement near her, that image elicits an old trauma memory of many other occasions when she has been hit unexpectedly. What consequence did she give her son? She grabs her chin, pauses, and then she kisses him. And I would tell you that this is a procedure, a cognitive procedure for safety. Show affection to the person who is harming because that will make you safe. It's not often that you get to see a delusion. We talk about them. We imagine that they're there but you saw it. And both the image and the procedural information rely on shortcuts that she had brought from childhood. For this we would give a U-trauma delusion of repair. 

00:54:55
Questions • Did the baby hit Cecilia aggressively? • Did he hurt her? • Did Cecilia perceive pain? • Did she expect to be hit? • This is a delusion! • What consequence did she give her son? Utr(dl-repair) males hitting women 

00:54:55
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN How do you repair the problem? I'm going to generalize a little bit of males hitting women? Big Bob hitting her mother, Big Bob hitting her, uhm, other partners hitting her. How do you resolve the problem of males who hit females? You show affection, it all goes away. Cecilia's history. She had a sibling who died of shaken baby syndrome. She had seven hospitalizations in first year of life. She had 29 by age 18, does she know something about violence? She does. She had multiple abandonments by her mother and Big Bob was most frequently the person in charge. He was in the household for 10 years. The mother's boyfriends took care of her. They also sexually abused her. And the baby's father was currently in prison for partner violence to a previous partner. Look at that history. And now you have a basis for both the AAI information about abandonment and marital fighting and the dog. Put it all together. Uhm, and this, uhm, over response to the possibility of being hit. I think but I can-- I don't have evidence to a assert it by a male child. I suspect it might have been a quite different interaction had her baby been a female but I can't prove that. The risk to Cecilia's son is that he will be rewarded with a kiss and maternal affection for unintended aggression. In the clip you saw, he didn't even know he did it. But if this happens again, and again, and again at some point, he will make the cognitive cognition between I do something violent and mommy hugs me, kisses me, loves me. He learns that aggression is approved and it elicits love. What will be his relationships in school? Think about Alan's little boy who came up and hit that little girl coming out of her shell with the truck. Could Diego be that little boy making an affectionate approach aggressively in another few years? What will be his relationships with girls and women? Is Cecilia's delusional repair of her trauma creating a bully or a violent husband? Could she have wanted to do that if she were aware of possible outcomes of this behavior being repeated overtime? Is this possibly the history of some men who are violent in relationships and show up the next day with flowers? Never expecting that they would be turned away or that the violence would be disapproved of. And if so, will a zero tolerance policy be the most effective way to reduce bullying or partner violence? If that's been the history for the male, will zero tolerance overcome it? I don't think we have that kind of a complex model of what might produce a bully? Uhm, so I wanna talk about the complexity of victimization. I don't see that as so simple either. Cecilia needed Big Bob. And Mary Ainsworth taught me the difference between what you need and what you want. What you need is what you will die from if you are not given it. And these children abandoned by their mother had the risk of not living 29 hospitalizations, we're getting close to not surviving. She liked her his protection. She liked his attention. She signaled he-- her desire for his attention. 

00:59:35
The complexity of victimization 

00:59:40
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN This is a neglected kid. They signal what they want. She feared Big Bob. She feared his violence. She feared being abandoned by him too. Hence, the need to be affectionate in return. She didn't like and was confused by his sexual approaches. She felt complicitous in what happened. She felt she was a part of the ongoing relationship with him. She did not feel she was an innocent victim but rather someone who had invited and half-liked what came. And she couldn't differentiate causality. Signaling, I want you, come, hold me, pick me from responsibility for what the other person did when they came and held you and pick you up. Sometimes I'm not sure we make that distinction very well but surely children cannot make the distinction between having causal input and bearing responsibility for it. And I don't think the people who worked with her were able to address that complexity in her history. In fact, one of her complaints when she was moved in to the mother baby home was, "Well, I was in child protection all of my childhood. If you thought I was going to be a risk to my child, why didn't you do something to protect me? Why are you now attacking me as a mother?" Well, indeed, why? Uhm, one of my long-term goals has been to understand enough about parents who don't manage their children adequately that we can change the way we respond to those parents because I don't think service as I've seen it delivered is yet good enough. I think this kind of an understanding of complexity can change what we do with the boys, with the men, with the mothers, with the children. And I don't have time to talk about the complexity of abusing other than to say, if you, if you read the preface to Raising Parents, I write a little bit about my own experiences and why I have chosen to spend a lifetime doing these things. And at the very end of that preface, I bring up a young woman with Borderline Personality Disorder, a cutter. And she fa-- sher-- she was abandoned, she was in and out of foster care and then out of institution. She became a cutter. You can build a story to fit all of that. She learned when she was an older adolescent that she had been sexually abused. It wasn't the word that she used and she didn't use words like groomed, but that was what her social worker discovered from what she was saying and as an adult she could say that about herself. And so she told the story. Ah, the old man down by the pond who groomed her and sexually abused her. But she also made these little figurines, hundreds of them, almost identical of an old man sitting on a bench by the park bringing along some food to share with the ducks but also with her. 

01:03:20
The complexity of abusing 

01:03:20
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN And if you look at his eyes, how lonely is this man. How much does he want some human contact with someone. And this is the person who care about her for several years of her life when there was no one else who cared about her. Is it sexual abuse? Is it the luck of finding someone who needs to find someone and will pay attention to you? Or is it some complex combination of this? Is this man evil? You know, he doesn't look evil to me. But we could call him a dirty old man if we wanted, that's in the language. And I use this little figurine to say there's something that her hands and her images know that our professional understanding of sexual abuse has not allowed her to say or acknowledge. She can't tell us because we won't hear the positive things about this experience with the man that we've labeled sexually abusive. Wanna take the label away? I wanna make the condition complex and thereby more realistic. Uhm, if we're going to use Cecilia's trauma productively. What does Cecilia need to know? Well, she needs to know that intimacy with males was important for her survival in childhood. That her context with her son is not like that with Big Bob or with her boyfriend. Her son needs a different response from her than Big Bob and the boyfriend need. And the question becomes, how can we help her to discover and use these differences in relationships and to use the information to regulate her behavior? The implications for treatment are several. I think she needs a safe context for reassemble the information and to attribution of new meanings to it. She won't be able to do that while we threaten her with taking her child away. 

01:05:45
Implications for treatment 1. Safe context for reassembly of information & attribution of new meanings 2. Protective & comforting transitional attachment figure working in client's ZPD 3. Focus on adaptation to past & current danger 4. Opposite ABC strategies need opposite treatments 5. Choosing techniques: • Functional formulation of the symptoms. • Treatment techniques suited to ABC type of information (1st do no harm). • Person-specific treatment plans. 6. Consider any children. 

01:05:45
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN She needs protective and comforting transitional attachment figure or professional who works in her zone of proximal development. Not doing what her son needs to have her do, doing what she is ready to do. We need to focus her on her adaptation in the past, "Good girl Cecilia, you survived. Not everyone in your family did and you figured out how to do it." Ah, but you're out of that family. You can cre-- recreate it or you can go somewhere new in your future. Then there is the basic idea that cognition and affect yield opposite strategies that may need opposite treatments. We may not be treating PTSD or trauma but a disorder of cognitive attributions and affective attributions and they need to be addressed in the treatment strategies that we select not the symptoms but the underlying neurological processing information. And so now we need to choose techniques that set a functional formulation of the symptoms, not a DSM diagnosis but how do these symptoms function for you in the past, how are they functioning now? And treatment techniques suited to the A or C types of information, keeping in mind, first do no harm. Don't rush in with the treatment that could augment the distortion because you haven't taken the time to find out what the distortion is. And I think we need person-specific treatment plans that are handled person to person. That doesn't rule out group treatment, probably does rule out manualized treatment because then the patient has to adopt the manual and they've had to adopt to other people all their life, the whole point of treatment, is it someone adopts to them. Uhm, and consider any children. If you work with adults, and they're disturbed do consider their children. Uhm, a couple of conclusions. The mind has an amazing capacity to retain information relevant to danger and comfort and sexual opportunity. And the information, uhm, is used to protect the self so that the mind disassociates bits of information that are too dangerous at the moment and tucks them away. And look how I've taken the word dissociation apart. And said, look, the mind can only do two things, put things together and keep them apart. And the question becomes what keeping apart is healthy and what is not? And it over associates other bits of information to retain vigilance. 

01:09:00
Conclusions • The mind has an amazing capacity to retain information relevant to danger and comfort. • To protect the self, the mind: • Dis-associates bits of information & tucks them away • Over-associates other bits to retain vigilance • Frames information in evocative & metaphorical terms that ensure emotional meaning is retained, without explicit awareness. • Development, reflection, and treatment offer ways forward, especially with the help of a protective attachment figure. 

01:09:05
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN It frames information, an evocative and metaphorical terms about protecting the dog for example. That ensure the emotional meaning is retained without explicit awareness of the danger to the self. And development, reflection, and treatment offer ways forward especially with the help of a protective attachment figure. If I go back to Mike(ph) again, this is choosing a good partner. You don't need a therapist if your partner is protective and comforting but if you don't get that you might need a professional to fulfill this role. Uhm, this is the book that I was referring to if I've intrigued you with the new way of looking at attachment.

DMM Attachment Theory Raising Parents Attachment, parenting and child safety AAI Discourse Analysis 

01:10:00
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN This is the best presentation in book form and if you were interested in the discourse analysis, this is the book that describes how we do the discourse analysis using this larger circular model. And the information processing that goes with it. So thank you. If you wanted to reach me, this is how you do it. 

01:10:30
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK And that can, ah-- it's, it's, it's-- hard for you to ask, if it-- please give some reflection and Collin who is our speaker after lunch who maybe has-- full of some reflections. And then leave some time for the audience to, ah, respond. 

01:10:50
UNKNOWN Is this, is this on? Uhm, I knew Bessel would traumatize me this well. 

01:11:00
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Put you under stress. 

01:11:05
UNKNOWN Uhm, let me make just a couple of prefatory comments. One is, it's been recognized that, uhm, Alan study is a remarkable study. I-- if you need a reflection on that, my reflection is, I'm really glad I did not try to do this study. And, uhm, part of that reflection is my awe, uhm, at, uhm, at its, at its-- the, the quality of what was done and your ability to think about it and to bring really new ways to think about it. Ah, Alan was, uhm, a year ahead of me when we were in graduate school. Uhm, he was, you know, that person who everyone saw Alan who you know. I was in the awe then and, uhm, I've been in a awe over the, over the years. Uhm, and what I'm really pleases, we're wearing the same jacket. How is that? That's a lot of years ago, right. Uhm, and, uhm, I wanna say, ah, in terms of Pat's thinking, I, I work with someone she works with whose taught me a lot about, uhm, your way of thinking. Uhm, and, uhm, I, I found this presentation really, really intriguing and so I will share my thoughts, uhm, and, uhm, just some reflections. Uhm, this, ah, unprepared so all of you are experiencing one reflection that I expect that all of us have which is-- well, this is really complex, or this is complicated. And complicated is about my favorite. So, uhm, I, I really, ah, I guess I enjoy, uhm, things being complex or complicated and complex. Uhm, so here is some thoughts and you know, take them, take them as you will. Uhm, uhm, I don't need to, ah, really comment beyond, uhm, sort of what was said and you expect me to be critical. So that's everybody's expectation so I will be critical of some things... 

01:13:40
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK No, no, well, ah, let's illustrate the complexity. 

01:13:40
UNKNOWN No, Bessel, Bessel. He's very difficult. Uhm, that this is a developmental perspective I think is absolutely essential and I appreciate both of you speaking to that. Uhm, Alan talks about a foundational idea in accumulative idea, uhm, with a kind of an invocation of a linear model. Uhm, if we take it as, as such. Ah, I have, ah, a couple of issues come up for me, uhm, in thinking, in thinking about it. One is, uhm, I'm not sure I see development as linear and simply as accumulative. Uhm, it has those characteristics and it certainly has those characteristics when we look at it, uhm, at a particular distance or particular lens or we're constrained by what we can do in terms of what we can look at and how much we can look at. And one has to remember, in Alan's work he has tried to see really what was, what was happening. But the model that I would have, uhm, uhm, would be a model which is, ah, a much more, uhm, dynamic model and in a way it relates to the way, uhm, Pat talked about, the clinical case of material. Uhm, and the dynamics of what was going on. But the dynamics that, that, that I would see is that as you, uhm, and this really f-- is formulated in the work, uhm, Louis Sander, Louis Sander who, uhm, unfortunately, uhm, died this year but left us with a great legacy. And I know Alan is a great admirer and I think maybe everyone at the table. But getting to the point, uhm, is that in development when you talk about, uhm, a, a process happening, some event happening. The, the phenomenon of that process happening is if it has an effect, it changes something. And once that thing is changed, other thing is changed. And it's not just that you're adding in pieces, you're not just adding in trauma to abuse to something else. But the phenomenon is that they really have these, these changes have the opportunity to self-amplify themselves. And so they build on themselves overtime. You can picture any kind of spiraling model that you would like and we talk about vicious cycles and things like that. And two examples of that is, I, I fully agree with Alan when he says, ah, resilience is for example not a trait. Uhm, and also that in his terms that security of attachment, uhm, ah, ah, is, is a developmental phenomenon. Uhm, both of them are developmental phenomenon. I, I see resilience as emerging out of the interactive processes that are taking place I think in the same way that Alan and Pat may see, uhm, ah, things like security or different kinds of styles of thinking about things as emerging out of the interactive, ah, processes. But, think about it this way, if the process for example of generating resilience or for that matter security of attachment is that you have some kind of stress, say being left alone for little while and it gets resolved. The child incorporates that resolution so that the next time they come to a situation, they have something that we can use as a term we might call resilience where they have coping capacity that when they face the next stress which might be the same one as they faced a moment before, they, they, the child actually has less trouble with it. And overtime, what happens is, as that child develops this capacity in the face of stresses and is successful and this would be most likely in an interactive environment where they're getting scaffolded by the parent to cope with the stress. They build a capacity and at some point you look at a child who has had this chronic reiterated ongoing experience and you say, this child is really able to cope with many different kinds of stressors. And it's a developmental phenomenon but the fact that he has had built up inside of him capacities to cope with stressors has allowed him to more effectively cope with stressors. And so it built on itself, right? And it can be disruptive in the same kind of way if he has this capacity and faces a stress that's really too great, it really will exceed the child's capacity to do that. And now, he's pushed in a slightly different direction. Uhm, I refer to this as the marathon hypothesis, uhm, where for those of you I know it's a bad moment, uhm, you know, and thinking-- and training for marathons what you do is you train but you don't run the marathon until you actually run the marathon. You train in bits and pieces. If you train appropriately, you develop capacity out of your interactive action with the environment you're running, right? If you over train, you actually weaken yourself, right. Uhm, but eventually, if you're affective, you can run the marathon which means that a child who has had experience in really coping with stress is perhaps more capable when faced with a really big stress of coping with that one. And if they overcome that one, they have even more capacity to do this. So I would like to see a, a much more dynamic model. And I think when, ah, Pat or certainly my thinking isn't in that kind of sense that it has to do with chronic experience, it has to do with the individual human being imbedded in the environment and processing that kind of experiencing-- the experience and building capacity as a system that they then bring into their interactions and they have affects in doing that. And it builds and accumulates overtime. Someone who, uhm, I think does this in the area of problematic behavior in adolescence, ah, which is all behavior of adolescence, uhm, is someone named Isabela Granic, G-R-A-N-I-C. And she has, ah, developmental model of this. Can I? The second thing, uhm, is I think because of this work, uhm, a new question really present itself and maybe some of you shared this experience. I think what we need, uhm, in a sense what the next question is, uhm, and I think Pat in her model more so than the general attachment model is struggled with this is that we need, uhm, to be able to understand the specificity of outcomes. So, and forgive me Alan. Uhm, you know, you can overcharacterize things you say while insecurely attached and then later on you have problems. But for me, and, and I think that's true. But for me the question is, how do you get to be borderline if we wanna use that category? And I'll come back to that. How do you get to be a psychopath? How do you end up being depressed? How do you end up being depressed and angry as opposed to depressed and whatever. We seem-- uhm, or at least some of you may have seen this letter by Tom Insel saying, you know, the DSM five now. Uhm, you know, is, ah, sort of nice book to read and it may be helpful to clinicians but this is not the way we're gonna be doing our research. So I think what we really need is very process oriented kind of research. Now, why do I say that? Because I do process one and do research. So it must be true but you know, I spend my time you know, microanalysing behavior. I spend my time now very concern with how infants and young children cope with stress. I'm very concern about the regulatory process that's going on, the mutual regulation that takes place between a parent and an infant is one that in my model or my thinking can either buffer the child from the stressors. There were parents who do not bring their past history in a toxic way into their interactions with their children. There are parents who do bring it in. Uhm, I, I think your videotape Pat is, is just well, you didn't do-- you didn't do the behavior but the videotape is remarkable. Uhm, so but there are also parents transduce to choose or, uhm, the stress that they have. They bring it into the moment with the child, they bring it in to the moment in a particular way. And what we need to look at and I think this goes back to some the Mary Main's work where she pointed out how, uhm, this organization comes out of the parent and Karlen has done this kind of work. Uhm, I, I still remember some of her videotapes that I've seen where the mother he engages in a bit of threatening behavior and then backs away from it or keeps on coming. Uhm, these interchanges, when you have a really competent infant whose gonna show development and you have a parent interacting with him and have-- you have this system meaning, the infant or the young child children fully imbedded in the exchange with the world because that's what they're doing, uhm, that these things build in ways of (B) and these ways of (B) serve functional purposes the way Pat talks about them. They allow the individual to become more coherent and complex but eventually they may lead you into becoming problematic in terms of your relationships with other people. I think that has to do with system's principles about maximizing coherence and complexity. So the last thought I have is, uhm, in hearing both presentations and given the work that's really been accomplished over the past 30 years is in a sense, why are we still holding on to, to topologies? Why are we still holding on to a limited set of categories. Pat may have a larger circle and-- but the real importance for me of Pat's larger circle is the processes that you invoke. 

01:26:10
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN I agree. I agree. 

01:26:15
UNKNOWN And I think that's-- right. Uhm, I'm not sure, I fully agree with the processes but I actually like them a lot but it's the processes and when you bring say two dimensions together that have dimensional content and there are other dimensions in the-- you now have the possibility of really creating unique outcomes. And certainly as clinicians, what we have to do is deal with individuals who are unique and this is really where you came to. But we can take a step away from that so I would love you know, uhm, a multi-- I, I like these complex kinds of models, you know, this multidimensional space going on, Uhm, and a one last thought, uhm, and this actually relates to something that Bessel has taught me, uhm, which is you know, of course this Bessel's really classic paper but he's built on this in terms of the body and schematic processes. Uhm, and when we talk about meaning, uhm, meaning once it's formed is already a category, you make meaning about something, you are dangerous, you're whatever, right. But they're all the processes that I call, what Jerry Burner called meaning making processes that generate the meaning, right. I think we're still stuck a little although we made a big advance, uhm, in terms of you know, we talked about language, right. We talked about conscious meaning like in processes. But I think what Bessel taught us first around trauma but I think it's absolutely true about all the meaning making processes. That these meaning making processes can be seen as, as something like a vertical dimension. So what we're all sitting here, we're making meaning, we're making meaning at our cortical levels, we're meaning at our limbic levels, we're making meaning in the diencephalon, we're making in our, ah, autonomic nervous system, we're making meaning at our HPA axis, uhm, you're having effects on things like your immune system. And they will have effects on the kinds of psychobiological state you will be in and the kinds of meanings that you can generate. So you really have to be careful not to start restricting meaning making to processes. We've abandon that they're only explicit but they're not just procedural and they're not just implicit. But the body is making meaning for us because we get organizes the whole psychobiological system not just single separate systems. And the meanings I think that Pat and Alan talk about and I know that Karlen talks about, or meanings that are in our systems, the hypervigilant child has an autonomic nervous system that is going to make meaning about the world in particular kinds of ways. They're hypothalamic access is going to operate in a different kind of way because of the kinds of the experiences really chronic, reiterated experiences that they have. If you have a compromised immune system and is generating inflammatory process, you are in a different psycholo-- psychobiological state when you confront the same situation that I confront and you will make different meanings out of it. And so we need include the body and these bodily process and in fact, even more basic bodily processes when we've tended to think about. So... 

01:30:15
UNKNOWN Can I say something? 

01:30:20
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Yeah, yeah.

ALAN SROUFE I'll, I'll be brief cuz-- this one live now? I agree with everything you said. Can you hear anything that was accounted to anything, I personally believe. Uhm, what I mean by the word cumulative is dynamic. I don't mean legal, you know, it's not like building the way it goes. It's dynamic because what happens first frames how you react to what happens next even though what happens next changes the frame and on, and on, and on. So 100% there, uhm, need for process studies exactly. First, you have to do outcome studies and process studies. What are you studying the process of? I mean, it's kind of, ah, chicken and egg situation but it's real good to have some defined outcomes in order to say, "Okay, this is where it can be good to study process because these things are linked, now we have to know how they're linked and how that work." Ah, the third thing, why do we do typologies in that dimensions? Ah, typologies are just placeholders. Ah, there-- they're crude cutting points. If Ainsworth hadn't come up with her categories, you wouldn't have the dimensional studies of attachment that exist. I mean, it wasn't God-given that avoidance is a dimension. So, typologies are only placeholders, and, and I think we all need to know that. I, I agree 100% we, we ultimately want to move beyond typologies but they serve our place, ah, as a research strategy. And, uhm, the whole, the whole thing is about making... 

01:32:00
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Can, can I say? I'd like to sort anything. And then-- ah, I thought that Pat's take was very powerful and very triggering in a way. Uhm, ah, and my reaction is also, this is what we see everyday, working in the clinic. And, we really don't have any guidance about what to do with it but there's lots of people right here who deal with situation like this everyday and who have become very good experts in dealing with it more than we are. And I'm thinking how can we get acknowledge not to be engage down there, up here, and vice versa because there's always for down here to there. I had this people in the audience who I've work with like this Liss Warner(ph), and Alice Cook(ph), and Margaret Blastine(ph) and Philip Scot(ph) who I'm working these kids everyday and see this. And so the question is, how do we get that knowledge up here? So we could have the bi-directional treatment? 

01:32:55
ALAN SROUFE My main reaction to Pat's third talk was what a great set of hypothesis. 

01:33:00
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Right. 

01:33:00
ALAN SROUFE And what a tremendous research agenda. 

01:33:05
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Yeah. 

01:33:05
ALAN SROUFE I mean, students actually asked, "Oh, gee, it's too bad you did that study, now everything is done and you wanna say, 'Give me break.'" 

01:33:10
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Right. 

01:33:15
ALAN SROUFE The best we could say is, now everything started. 

01:33:15
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK That's right, that's right. 

01:33:15
ALAN SROUFE That would be good. Right. 

01:33:20
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK They're both eager to say something. Go ahead, go ahead. 

01:33:20
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN Uhm, I had, ah, well, the, the comment that just came to mind is I do cross-sectional work and the purpose of it is to generate hypothesis. I don't have the elegant data that Alan does I have a new set of hypothesis and I hope I intrigued you that some of them could interesting. In response to Bessel's comment. When I do this AAI, for mothers who are in trouble and I have to write up what I think their experience is, that is a very powerful way of affecting their future. I get statements like - 

01:34:00
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Yeah. 

01:34:00
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN - I didn't want that Miami bird to see my AAI, what could she know about me over here in England? But she understands me better than any of you all people do. And that sense that somebody understood the pain that you had been through and the effort you had made to accommodate is tremendously freeing. Cecilia did keep Diego. She is, the last time I heard, was in the process of getting her own apartment having him some days of the week. She felt understood as she was complexly. I didn't write a glowing report - 

01:34:40
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Hmm. 

01:34:45
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN - I wrote a complex report that came as close to her reality as I could get. And it didn't put her in a classification, there are no classifications in the reports I write. Finally, the thing I wanted to say was about resilience. I know, only you don't think it is a trait and do think it is a process. I think it is a process that is gone through everyday all the time at a lot of cost that the people with the difficult backgrounds work hard to live everyday in safe environments. They do know what to do for danger. 

01:35:25
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Hmm, hmm. 

01:35:25
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN Let the bad things happen. They've got the procedures, they know what to do. They're on target. They flip back into that old knowledge instantly. It's living in safety and comfort, that is the challenge. 

01:35:40
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK That is such an important point. 

01:35:40
Karlen Lyons-Ruth, Ph.D. 

01:35:45
KARLEN LYONS-RUTH Well, I just-- I wanted to reflect it on-- but this quite, ah, thrill for me actually to be on this particular podium with both Alan and Pat and it causes me to reflect on the history of learning more about these early, uhm, foundational interactions in infancy because in around 1970 to '80, there was basically when I became into the clinical field and when I have to work with mothers and infants, I was told that you-- we didn't know which mothers and infants would possibly be at risk for later problems that we couldn't tell. We had to wait until the children took school-age and then we could begin to, to treat them and see who had developed those problems. So there was-- and I remember another piece studied by Ray Starr who had, uhm, some social workers looking at videotapes of parents, uhm, in protective custody or not and asking them to like-- that these exactly the judgment you are making is how high risk is this parent and child. And they were-- could only make judgments at random. They were no better than random at deciding who was in abusive or neglecting parent. And it was not based on the interactions. So, it's amazing and I remember going to Pat, ah, early on, ah, when she was just beginning to look at maltreating mothers in their infants. Uhm, and then I remember following in Alan's footsteps for 30 years now because his study started, uhm, as I was in graduate school and I was like, this is, this is what I want to do. You know, this is so exciting and so groundbreaking that we're not starting right at the beginning to see how these developmental process just play out. So just to have those of you who are much younger and who sort of wouldn't have this whole history, this is a very recent-- it's in the lifetimes of these researchers that we have opened up these developmental processes that we've opened up and look at these very fine grained interactive processes that-- at stressing and which we all certainly feel very interested in. So it's an amazing amount of new knowledge that's come into the field. I know many of you have-- are working actively now to bring thing to clinical treatment efforts, uhm, but I just want to in some ways thank two people who are very much mentors to me in the beginning. Uhm, and ne-- sort of acknowledge how much this work has contributed to all of our understandings of our very traumatized patients. 

01:38:20
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK We have a few minutes for you guys. Anybody have a question or it is okay to you? There's a microphone here. If he stole the microphone there, I don't see the-- is that microphone, yeah, go ahead. 

01:38:35
UNKNOWN Well, I really just wanted to say thank you. I'm one of the people in the trenches working with mothers and kids. And it's been really frustrating cuz most of the literature on trauma does not reflect what I'm actually seeing and working with. So thanks to all of you for that. And, uhm, I just also wanted to say, his-- so on the present and this presentation but nobody is actually ever mentioned Bowlby's name which I thought was kind of interesting. 

01:39:05
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Oh, he's, he's up there. 

01:39:05
UNKNOWN I know. 

01:39:05
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK The hovering, smiling, grumpy, you know. 

01:39:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) be careful with that. I heard that, I heard that. 

01:39:10
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Microphone. 

01:39:15
[sil.] 

01:39:20
UNKNOWN Hi. Uhm, thank you for this research and opportunity to learn about this. Uhm, when thinking about the complexities of interactional processes on development and trauma, a piece that I haven't heard much about is considerations of the impact of racism, oppression, sexual minority status and gender on the development and growth of children and those-- the outcomes of, of, ah, healing from trauma in different populations. And I'm just curious to hear your thoughts about that. Thank you. 

01:39:55
[sil.] 

01:39:55
Patricia Crittenden, Ph.D. 

01:40:00
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN I actually tried to open that door with Cecilia and Diego, uhm, pointing out that her being a girl with a stepfather who care for her had some implications that I suspected the way she raised her son was different in the way she would have raised her daughter. I think there was a whole gender overlay to what I was seeing with her that isn't the issue of racism but it is the issue of gender and sexual stereotypes that only do people in families have but also professionals who try to address the problems faced by those people. 

01:40:45
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK And I wonder about Alan-- ah, the great done of Alan sample actually, of your sample of the 180 kids, ah, eventually... 

01:40:50
ALAN SROUFE Yes. Ah, the problem that we had was Minneapolis was 80% White in the mid 1970s, now it's not but - 

01:41:00
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Yeah, yeah. 

01:41:00
ALAN SROUFE - so it wasn't something we could do. We do have publications on being able to predict how a mother will treat a daughter if she's seductive with the son. And it is, it is predictable. If you're seductive with your son, you'll be hostile with your daughter and you'll be hostile on a particular way which we called derision. "What's the matter with you? You're just a stupid little girl." All predictable from developmental history, it's complicated but that's probably that's published in-- you can find it. It's called, ah, seductive behavior as the first one and the second one is called generational boundary dissolution. 

01:41:40
UNKNOWN I... 

01:41:45
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Go ahead. Yeah. 

01:41:45
UNKNOWN I have a point specifically to this question. 

01:41:45
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Oh. 

01:41:50
UNKNOWN If I may. We-- we've just finished, ah, two studies where we looked at, uhm, ah, a great measure that you might even incorporate clinically. Uhm, you can look at cortisol deposits in hair sample so you get a retrospective look at the amount of cortisol that's been deposited over past 3 or 6 months. We did a community sample and what we found was that what you probably all expect that higher social status and it was, ah, a fairly wide range, uhm, is protective both against, uhm, hair cortisol level. So the lower, the high your status and, uhm, that the high your status the less-- the le-- fewer stressors your self-report. However, it does not hold for, uhm, our African-American sample. In the African-American sample we found no benefit at all in terms of cortisol levels or stress, uhm, from high status. So high and low status were and they-- and it was highly-- there was highly-- high levels of stress. We just finish a study which is not complete but it looks really very clear that if you look at a history of discrimination re-- self-reports of the history of discrimination, uhm, we find very much the same kind of relationship, a long history of discrimination not in the moment but a long history of discrimination leads to high levels of cortisol, uhm, deposits in the individuals and that's of course largely again and, uhm, an African-American population but is not only in an African-American population. 

01:43:40
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK It reminds me of, ah, the working monkeys with Raleigh and McGuire. We, we still in such a few, few hormones because it gets excess with a few but monkeys who had high social status got high serotonin levels. And then they, ah, actually she lowered their serotonin, their status jolts parallel to it and vice versa and that the time that you guys were in Wisconsin. So were-- go ahead. 

01:44:05
UNKNOWN Uhm, I think this whole topic of indival-- individualized treatment is so important and exciting. And I'm wondering when you're talking about different strategies of treatment according to the A or the C, ah, adaptation strategy. Can you say something more specific about what you do know about tailoring treatments according to that way of thinking? 

01:44:30
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Good. 

01:44:30
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN I can say what I think but I don't have data to support it although I can cite other published studies that, ah, consistent with what I say but, but I can't directly say that what I'm going to say next works. If I had an individual using a Type A strategy, not a Type A individual, an individual using a Type A strategy of inhibiting negative affect and using predictions, uhm, temporal predictions to regulate their behavior. I would not use cognitive treatments. They would excel at them because that's the strategy they've been using all along. Your... 

01:45:20
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Ah, as to the people who developed this, ah, man-- manuals. 

01:45:20
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:45:25
[sil.] 

01:45:30
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN Uhm, at-- they, they would yield wonderful data on the success of the treatment but they would be in strategy, they would not have gotten access to the missing affective information. But if I had a person using a Type C strategy, I wouldn't be asking them to their inner feelings and learn how to express them. I'd be wanting to teach them inhibition, uhm, to teach them the temporal ordering and predictability. It's that kind of a difference I would be looking at. 

01:46:05
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK We have-- we really way overtime but I see people standing up and in vain so a quick question. May you-- we may, may not exacerbate so are your questions, so are your questions Sandy(ph) and Elias(ph) and just, just, just let (inaudible ) here. 

01:46:17
UNKNOWN Mine was very quick. I had read a report, ah, several years ago that had showed the discrepancy between, ah, African immigrants and African-Americans as well as compared to Caucasians in such and I was wondering if, if the cortisol levels if the-- if you had the data, there's a discrepancy between, ah, African immigrants and African-Americans. 

01:46:35
UNKNOWN We, we didn't have, ah, sufficient numbers to break that down but you are likely to see differences and that's well captured in the public health data in terms of what's referred to as the immigrant paradox of first generation parental immigrants often doing a whole lot better than their children, uhm, are doing. And, so immigrant status is, is, is really an important factor. 

01:47:05
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Sandy(ph). 

01:47:05
SANDY Quick. I am interested in incorporating, uhm, attachment styles into treatment for young adults meaning, I'm looking for an assessment tool that I can use as just really self-report not the-- not the whole attachment interview. 

01:47:15
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Good question. 

01:47:20
SANDY But that-- then I can share the results with them and use that as part of my intervention, I'm wondering if you actually just... 

01:47:20
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Tha's a very, that's a very (inaudible ) question. 

01:47:25
PATRICIA CRITTENDEN It's impossible. 

01:47:30
[sil.] 

01:47:35
ALAN SROUFE Is it possible? 

01:47:35
UNKNOWN It's been tried. 

01:47:35
ALAN SROUFE Not yet. 

01:47:35
UNKNOWN Is it possible? 

01:47:40
KARLEN LYONS-RUTH People work on this (inaudible ) been working on it for probably 30 years. The problem of course is obvious that if, if you're not conscious at your strategies that what you report has no relation and they've been there are young adults, ah, attachment in self-report inventories but they don't correlate with what see developmentally in terms of attachment strategy. So, you can use them but there are animal and they're not getting it the same things. 

01:48:05
ALAN SROUFE Our attachment assessments predict adult attachment interview outcomes but not the, ah, quick and dirty, ask somebody were you dismissing or not-- questions. 

01:48:15
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Okay, thank you. Have lunch, uhm, see you at 10. 

01:48:20
