What is Motivational Interviewing 

00:00:05
THOM PANCELLA Hello, and welcome to this MIMHtraining.com presentation called What is Motivational Interviewing. I'm Thom Pancella with the Missouri Institute of Mental Health, thanks for joining us today. With me is a colleague at the Missouri Institute of Mental Health, Dr. Mary Dugan, she's a Research Assistant Professor here at the Missouri Institute of Mental Health. She is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. She got her Master's in social work from St. Louis University and her PhD in Counselor Education from the University of Missouri in St. Louis. Her research interests include cultural responsiveness, prevention, and the use of Motivational Interviewing, particularly with ethnic minorities. She has worked in various social service settings, including a substance abuse treatment center, community mental health agencies, as well in private practice. Her first experience with Motivational Interviewing occurred in the late 1990's, and more recently she participated in the Motivational Interviewing Supervisor's Training with William Miller and Theresa Moyers. Last year, in 2007, she was accepted into the Training for New Trainers conducted in Sofia, Bulgaria. And after that, she was accepted into the Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers. Mary, thanks for joining us today. 

00:01:15
MARY DUGAN You're welcome. Thanks for having me. 

00:01:15
THOM PANCELLA So let's start at the beginning. Uhm, when did Motivational Interviewing start? Ah, who was kind of credited with its formal introduction to the world? 

00:01:25
Mary Dugan, PhD 

00:01:25
MARY DUGAN Okay. Well, it's William Miller and Steve Rollnick, and in some areas those names are well-known, in others not so much. But, ah, they're both clinicians and they were both at a conference, ah, in Europe, I think the United Kingdom, but I'm not positive about the exact country. Ah, but Bill Miller did a presentation with the real client in front of the audience and was made some astounding progress and success and had a reputation for being very successful. So after the session was over, Steve Rollnick pulled him aside and said, "You know, hey, what's the deal here? That, that was awesome. How do you do that?" And Bill said, "Well, I just make it up. You know, it's not anything formalized." And he goes, "Well, it should be." And, uhm, they started having conversations after that and started working closer together with a group of their colleagues, uhm, early on. So they started publishing on it and exchanging information and doing kind of their own, uhm, I guess, research, you know, studying just how they did it and writing down what they did, and, and checking it out. And the first book was published in 1991, Motivational Interviewing. And that's when it really took off, ah, or people really started hearing about it outside of that little group of initial friends that worked on it. 

00:02:50
THOM PANCELLA So since then, is there some kind of formal definition of Motivational Interviewing now? 

00:02:55
MARY DUGAN Uhm, yeah, though that's also evolving, and it's come out of, ah, Bill Miller and, and Rollnick's work. Basically that it's a client center-- client-centered, directive method of helping people to look at change. And originally-- ah, it's interesting because originally, uhm, the word behavior change was in there. And then in the second edition of the book which came out about ten years later, 2001, I think, is the date on the second book, the, uhm, behavior part was left off the change and people thought it was a big shift in the way they were looking at Motivational Interviewing. And just recently, I saw a post from Bill Miller, somebody asking him about that, and he says, "You know, it's interesting." He says, "That was just, just a typo." He says, "I was typing-- writing it in, and I just didn't put the word behavior change in." He commented how it's interesting that a caffeine deficit resulted in a policy change. So, but the point is, and the, the real gist of it is that it's both client-centered and directive which for some people are contradictory terms. 

00:04:10
THOM PANCELLA So where is it used today? 

00:04:15
MARY DUGAN It is used in a lot of places today. It started in the substance abuse treatment field. Ah, Rollnick-- Steve Rollnick's background is in more health psychology, and so he was doing a lot of work in the health fields, so, uhm, it's used for-- just about anyplace people wanna change behavior, or reduce the resistance to behavior, so, you find it in the health field with cardiac patients, ah, with diabetics, uhm, people that have to work on their cholesterol, uhm, teenagers that they're try-- you're trying to make health changes with, ah, less risky behavior or more healthy activities, ah, exercise, smoking, just the whole range. It's interesting, it's also been adapted and embraced by the correctional, criminal justice system. That's about a third of the people using it now and publishing and researching are in the corrections, which, uhm, surprises some people at first because you think, well, they're incarcerated, what changes do they have? Or, they're on probation or parole and they have to do X, Y and Z. But it's been very successful in helping them, uhm, reduce recidivism, reduce resistance, and have more-- uhm, well, less unpleasant. I won't say more pleasant, but less unpleasant working situations. 

00:05:45
THOM PANCELLA Well, let's get into it a little bit, then. Ah, can you, can you describe it to us then? Can you describe Motivational Interviewing? 

00:05:55
MARY DUGAN I guess, if I was to draw a picture, I would draw a pyramid. And I would have-- much like the food pyramid that we have from, ah, Food and Drug Administration, and I would have spirit on the bottom, as the, the very foundation and the broadest piece of Motivational Interviewing. And then kind of in the middle, kind of the principles of Motivational Interviewing. And then at the top I would have, uhm, the strategies. 

00:06:20
THOM PANCELLA Okay, spirit, principles and strategies. 

00:06:25
MARY DUGAN Right. 

00:06:25
THOM PANCELLA So, let's start with spirit. 

00:06:25
MARY DUGAN Okay, spirit is actually, I guess the core of MI. Uhm, there's an acronym called ACE, A-C-E, a deck of cards for people that like acronyms, and the A is autonomy, uhm, C is collaboration and E is evocation. And the idea is that you, uhm, you, you have MI spirit or you're practicing or relating to people in the MI sprit if you respect their autonomy, that people have the right to make their own decisions, and it's their choice and their decision, even though we know certain things are better and have better outcomes, it ultimately comes down to their choice, and we can't make them do it or hammer it into them. The collaboration is a respectful way to work with people that, uhm, I may know more things about some areas, but you're the expert on your life, you know more about your situation and what you have to deal with, and what works for you and what doesn't work for you. So our work together should be collaborative, it shouldn't be me giving you a lecture and giving you a prescription and saying, "Go do this." We should work together. And the E part, the evocation refers to the fact that with Motivational Interviewing, I know you have it within you to make healthy choices and do what's best for you in your life in your situation. You may not know that, or you may not believe it. So it's my job to kind of pull it out, or evoke it out of you. So that's kind of the whole picture of MI spirit. 

00:08:10
THOM PANCELLA You put that at the bottom of the pyramid, why is it considered to be the foundation? Why is it so important? 

00:08:15
MARY DUGAN Well, it's considered to be so important because the strategies are basic skills, and you can practice those strategies without practicing in the spirit of MI. Ah, by the same token, if you have the MI spirit, you cannot do everything perfectly. But if you-- that relationship really comes across to the person you're working with, then that helps build the, the therapeutic relationship that will help you get your work done. 

00:08:50
THOM PANCELLA Interesting. 

00:08:50
MARY DUGAN Uh-hmm. 

00:08:50
THOM PANCELLA So, what are the, the principles, principles came next right? 

00:08:50
MARY DUGAN Ah, principles are, uhm, expressing empathy, that we're gonna express empathy, we're going to, uhm, develop discrepancy, and that's important because if somebody's gonna change they have to see a reason for change, so we wanna, ah, create ambivalence or help them become more uncomfortable with the difference between what they wanna do, what they're supposed to do, what their behavior actually is and what it's supposed to be, so that's to develop discrepancy. Uhm, let's see, support self-efficacy is another one, so we wanna support the person in making their own decisions, in, in taking the steps that they need to take to make the change. Uhm, and then R is roll with resistance, that instead of, uhm, pounding against them, ah, when we get resistance from a client, or, or getting defensive, or digging our heels in and not moving, we wanna learn to kind of roll with the resistance, and that will help us deflate it, which will let the person express their feelings, uhm, just kind of takes the wind out of their sails, I guess. So those principles are kind of the meat of-- or the core of how you-- uhm, what you're doing with the spirit of MI. 

00:10:25
THOM PANCELLA Now you mentioned that the, the strategies themselves were actually fairly basic techniques, fairly basic tools. What are some of the strategies? 

00:10:35
MARY DUGAN Well, we have another acronym, and that acronym would be OARS, O-A-R-S, and the O would be for open-ended questions, A would be for affirmations; R would be for reflections, and S would be for summaries. And those are actually things people learn in counseling 101 or helping 101, sometimes even at the undergrad level, so people look at them and they say, "Well, that's not new. I've been doing that for a long time." 

00:11:05
THOM PANCELLA Now you talked at the beginning about how, ah, this was born almost accidentally. 

00:11:10
MARY DUGAN Uh-hmm. 

00:11:15
THOM PANCELLA Is, is it-- has it been tied to a particular theory? 

00:11:15
MARY DUGAN Uhm, it's related to-- well, I guess there's two things to say about that. Theory is developing about Motivational Interviewing with the research that's being done. There are over 160 clinical trials now, and they're getting closer and closer to refining the definition and the theory of what Motivational Interviewing is. But it's also very related to some theories that, uhm, exist already, the, uhm, self-efficacy theory, that a person has within themselves, and that, if they believe they have it, then they can pull it out. So there are some theories that it definitely relates to. 

00:12:00
THOM PANCELLA How, how would you say Motivational Interviewing relates to Stages of Change? 

00:12:05
MARY DUGAN Stages of Change is actually a co-- a cousin of Motivational Interviewing. It's the latest-- or the way they talk about it-- uhm, as you might have heard, Prochaska and DiClemente are the creators or the developers of the Stages of Change, and Miller and Rollnick and some long-time MI trainers are getting away from talking about Stages of Change now, because there's been so much confusion, and kind of blending of the two that people think they're the same thing. Uhm, they actually were developed around the same time, ah, Prochaska and DiClemente were doing their work around the same time and started publishing around the same time that Miller and Rollnick did, but they actually weren't working together. They were, uhm, colleg-- collegial, and I'm sure they probably ran into each other, or knew of each other's works through the literature and through conferences. But the way we look at it is that, uhm, the Stages of Change model is, is a model of how change happens, Motivational Interviewing is an intervention that you implement to facilitate change happening. So you can't-- uhm, there's five stages in the, the chan-- Stages of Change, precontemplation, contemplation, ah, and so on. You can't precontemplate somebody or contemplate somebody, but you can, ah, use Motivational Interviewing with somebody. 

00:13:35
THOM PANCELLA So, how does it work? How does Motivational Interviewing help people change? What does the, what does the clinician do? 

00:13:45
MARY DUGAN Uhm, the clinician will use their strategies in a Motivational Interviewing. Uhm, well, we say adherent or, or style. They'll, you know, of course, keep in the back of their mind that they wanna, uhm, evoke what's in the client, they wanna be, uhm, empathic and, and, you know, those things we talked about before, so they'll use their strategies. They'll use open-ended questions, and the reflections, and then summaries and affirmations are less frequently used, but they use these things to direct the, direct the individual towards either developing the discrepancy in the beginning because sometimes people don't know, uhm, that they, they don't have any, they don't think that they have any problem, they're there because somebody said, "You have to come in," or, "You have to meet with this person." So-- or they may be in what they used to call denial, that, uhm, "Oh, I don't believe that I have a problem, it's everybody else that has a problem." So they use those-- their skills, in using those techniques, those strategies, to help the person come to recognize they don't. Uhm, I think we also talked about-- or maybe we didn't this time, but we talk about Rogerian, and client-centered therapy, and MI is very much related to and based on client-centered, it, it adds the directiveness to it. So, uhm, a Rogerian therapist would, you know, be with the client, join with the client. Uhm, but what some people found was that wasn't enough that you could join and be with them and support them and have this wonderful relationship, but it wasn't going anywhere. So that's, I guess, the beauty or the innovation that Bill Miller, ah, made up himself or found, is a way to be that way and still be directive. 

00:15:50
THOM PANCELLA And that kind of springs into the next question, which is kind of how Motivational Interviewing really is different from the-- how people are used to helping other people. And, and, and besides the Rogerian connections, are there other ways? 

00:16:05
MARY DUGAN Yeah. Uhm, Steve Rollnick talks about it in, in his new book, uhm, that the Rogerian way would be kind of a, a following way that we work with people, that we're with them and-- well, we just had that conversation, all those things. But another way that people help people is to be very directive. So, you know, you go to the doctor and he writes a prescription and says, you know, "Exercise three times a week, take this medication, and follow this diet." Or, "Do this for your high blood pressure.'' Reduce your salt, you know, whatever, that it's very, ah, directive, you know, he tells you what to do, he's the expert, you're coming in for advice. So, Rollnick talks about, and discusses in his book, how those two seem to be very, uhm, opposed to each other, or opposite ends of the spectrum. And that what they envision Motivational Interviewing, uhm, is as somewhere in the middle kind of a guide, so that sometimes the, the counselor, or the clinician, will follow the client, much like a guide might, ah, take you where you wanna go, or sometimes the clinician will be more directive and say, you know, "You really missed this, or you really ought to check this out," much like a guide would say if you hired a guide for-- to take you fishing or if you're on vacation, you know, and say, "Oh, these are the main tourist attractions, but, uhm, people really like this, or people really enjoy that." So, so that's-- and the guide moves back and forth between the two styles of being a, a follower and being more directive. 

00:17:45
THOM PANCELLA Your background is in social work. 

00:17:50
MARY DUGAN Uh-hmm. 

00:17:50
THOM PANCELLA What, what about Motivational Interviewing drew you into that? 

00:17:55
MARY DUGAN Uhm, well, the foundations are kind of the background of social work. I think, theoretically, it's a-- it looks at people holistically. Uhm, it's not just looking at what's inside the person's head like psychology or some other things might look at, but it looks at not only what's internal, what's going on inside the person, but what their eviron-- what environment they're in, and what's going on around them, and their relationships, what are their relationships with other people? And, it's very-- for me it was a very respectful, uhm, way to work with people and that it was part of the reason I chose social work, and the MI aspect of it seems to be a natural flow, or a natural intervention to fit with that. Uhm, I hesitate to say spiritual because Miller and Rollnick are very careful about not saying spiritual, but it-- when you think about spirituality separate from religion, it feels like a very spiritual, respectful approach to work with people. 

00:19:00
THOM PANCELLA Now Motivational Interviewing is considered to be an evidence-based practice. Ah, tell us a little what that is, what that means, and why that's important. 

00:19:10
MARY DUGAN Well, what it means is that it's been recognized by, uhm, lots of people. First of all, there's been, I think I mentioned, 160 or more clinical trials. In addition to the clinical trials, there's probably over 700-- between 700 and 750 publications in peer-reviewed journals. So there has been a lot of research and work with Motivational Interviewing, and these clinical trials and the, the research are producing evidence that it works. So, evidence-based means we've got hardcore facts, we have data that show that it works. Motivational Interviewing has been recognized by, ah, NIDA, the National Institute of Drug Abuse, which is part of National Institute of Health, one of the, uhm, I guess major, or, ah, largest federal funders of, of research in this country. And, more recently, uhm, Motivational Interviewing and kind of as-- anothe-- a way to use it, motivational enhancement theory-- therapy have both been recognized by the National Register of Evidence-Based Practices. So it's on the NREPP, N-R-E-P-P, NREPP website now as an evidence-based practice. And when you go to that website-- anybody can go to that website, and they have a menu when you wanna look for an intervention so you go to the intervention, and you can click in what your population is that you're working with, kind of age, gender, uhm, other descriptives, ah, some problem behaviors, you know, if you wanna do treatment or prevention or, or different things that-- to help your search, and then NREPP has the database of-- and it will match your search to all the criteria that you put in. So, Motivational Interviewing is now on that list, and there are several steps that the practice or the intervention has to, uhm, has to be evaluated on before they will put it on that list and there's lots of hoops to jump through to, to get listed on there, so it's, it's kind of a big deal. 

00:21:30
THOM PANCELLA So where can people get more information? 

00:21:35
MARY DUGAN Ah, I-- there's lots of places. I would start with the Motivational Interviewing website, ah, motivationalinterviewing, one word, dot.com. Uhm, the University of New Mexico has a section, ah, on their website, or a link on their site to a separate website. It's CASAA, Center for Alcohol and Substance Abuse, something, C-A-S-A-A. Ah, there are lots of books. Motivational Interviewing first came out in '91, the second edition around 2001. More recently, in just the last few months, we've had two new books come out. Ah, one is Motivational Interviewing for Psychological Problems, and the other is, uhm, Motivational Interviewing in the Healthcare Setting. Ah, and then, if, if you're so inclined, you can go to the peer-reviewed literature, and the website, the Motivational Interviewing website, has a list, a bibliography section, where they list them by years, and then alphabetized by author's last name, anything that they're either aware of, or people let them know, uhm, and they also have an abstract, ah, link where you can read abstracts of certain articles. Ah, a lot of people like to just do that rather than go to the library, so either way would get you there. Ah, on the website the clinical trials are highlighted in blue, so it's kind of an easy way to find if you really wanna look for the evidence, look through and just look at the clinical trials. 

00:23:15
