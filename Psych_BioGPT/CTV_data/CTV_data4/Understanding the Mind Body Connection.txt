HOWARD TORMAN I'm Dr. Howard Torman. Welcome to Health Choices. We'll explore the vast array of conventional and not so conventional approaches to health and medicine to help you make smarter health choices. 

00:00:30
HEALTH CHOICES 

00:00:30
Howard Torman, M.D. 

00:00:35
HOWARD TORMAN A lot of things have changed since I did my medical training here at Stanford University. And maybe one of the most remarkable changes is the integration of alternative medicine into not only the medical school curriculum, but also the general clinical environment. And one of the things they're focusing on here is mind/body medicine. In the past, the prevailing medical wisdom was that the mind played no real or substantial role in the body's ability to heal. Now that's not to say that we didn't believe that a positive attitude didn't help, but the idea that you could get a predictable improvement or maybe a significant change in the outcome of a disease by disciplining your mind, well that was a little hard to swallow. Now all of us have been in situations where our mental state has caused an involuntary physical reaction. You're really angry at something and what happens? Your heart rate goes up, your blood pressure goes up. But can you train your mind to voluntarily provoke a specific physical response? Well 3,000 miles from here at Harvard Medical School, Dr. Herbert Benson has been working for 30 years to establish that there is a reliable, reproducible connection between mind and body, and it can be used therapeutically. 

00:01:50
Herbert Benson, M.D. President, Mind/Body Medical Institute 

00:01:50
HERBERT BENSON, M.D. Someone just the other day put it succinctly. They came to me and said, "Herb, you know 20 years ago there were two people who, uh, believed in what you were doing. Now there are two people who don't believe." Things have changed because we, here, respond to science. 

00:02:10
HOWARD TORMAN 11 years ago, Dr. Benson founded the Mind/Body Medical Institute in cooperation with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School. The institute has programs to help patients cope with everything from insomnia to cancer. Patients like Patrick Rafter who is undergoing chemotherapy for brain cancer. 

00:02:25
Patrick Rafter Patient 

00:02:30
PATRICK RAFTER Last year, uh, when I was two months shy of my 40th birthday, uh, my wife noticed a big bump on my head. And, in fact, what I had was a tumor growing from my skull, pushing down onto my brain, about the size of a baseball. What I had to do, uh, to get rid of it was, first of all, um, brain surgery, which was not a lot of fun. Last December I began chemotherapy as treatment for my cancer. I decided ultimately that I wanted to go to the Mind/Body Clinic, because I had heard that the Mind/Body Clinic was teaching people skills that would be very useful to help them to overcome some of the symptoms that are associated with chemo. 

00:03:05
Ann Webster, Ph.D. Director, Mind/Body Program for Cancer 

00:03:05
ANN WEBSTER One of the things I do follow in all of the people who go through our cancer program is, both psychological and physical symptoms pre and post. And almost to a person we see statis-, statistically significant, um, reductions in anxiety and depression and anger, and improvements in sleep and, you know, side effects of chemotherapy and radiation. 

00:03:30
HOWARD TORMAN Dr. Benson has brought mind/body medicine closer to the mainstream with his research on the relaxation response. 

00:03:40
HERBERT BENSON The relaxation response is a physiologic state opposite to the state of arousal, the so-called fight or flight response. Now, whereas the fight or flight response comes upo-, uh, about automatically when your under stress, the relaxation response requires two steps. First is repetition of a word, a sound, a prayer, a phrase, or a muscular activity. 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN Then turn your focus to your out breath while repeating a word quietly to yourself. 

00:04:10
HERBERT BENSON And the second is when other thoughts come to mind, to passively left them go and to come back to the repetition. 

00:04:20
PATRICK RAFTER When I meditate all the cares of the world can go away because my body is entirely at peace. 

00:04:25
HERBERT BENSON The stress response has increased metabolism, increased blood pressure, increased rate of breathing, a 3-400% increased blood flow to our muscles. Relaxation response is just the opposite: decreased metabolism, decreased blood pressure, decreased rate of breathing, and a calmness, slower brain waves. 60- 90% of this is, to doctors, are in the mind/body stress related realm, and our routine pharmaceutical and, um, uh, uh, surgical approaches are of little use there. Whereas the relaxation response coupled with appropriate stress management, nutrition, and exercise can effectively treat that 60-90% of disorders. 60,000,000 people suffer from insomnia in America alone, directly related to stress. All of these can be effectively treated. 

00:05:20
Gregg D. Jacobs, Ph.D. Asst. Prof. of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School 

00:05:20
GREGG D. JACOBS If you learn to change your thoughts and your behaviors surrounding your sleep, you can actually overcome insomnia and eliminate sleeping pills. The relaxation response allows people a proven method of slowing their brain waves down, and if you can slow your brain waves down it's easier to get into the earlier stages of sleep. 

00:05:35
HOWARD TORMAN As you know, there are some people who are very critical of mind/body research in general and some of your work, in particular. Uh, they say that it really doesn't demonstrate efficacy here. How do you respond to them? 

00:05:45
HERBERT BENSON The standards required here are such that, uh, we would have to, uh, do th-, the, um, more demanding, uh, uh, types of study, and publish in appropriate places like Nature, like Science, like the New England Journal, which we have, uh, striven to do. But more importantly, we're talking about objective changes, the work of Dr. Craig Jacobs clinically curing 75% of insomnia patients. 

00:06:20
GREGG D. JACOBS Your skins sweating. We need to put, uh, sensors . . . we need to put them back on so we get an accurate reading there. Sensor, I'm holding em and . . . 

00:06:25
HERBERT BENSON Why then the criticisms? Why the criticisms? 

00:06:30
PATRICK RAFTER We were brought up in medicine to think that if it's, its got to be done to you, its got to be pharmaceutical or surgical, or it really doesn't work. Yet, all our neurobiology of this last decade is showing us that mind and body are inseparable. Mind affects body, body affects mind. Your visualizations are real. 

00:06:55
PATRICK RAFTER I've decided that I wanted to add the relaxation response to my daily routine because it makes me feel better, it makes me less nauseated, and it basically has improved my quality of life completely. 

00:07:05
HOWARD TORMAN The relaxation response is a relatively non-specific technique, meaning that when you practice it you get changes in a number of physiologic functions all at the same time. And you're not really too concerned what any one of them is doing. In biofeedback, however, you actually have a graphic display of different things that are going on in your body at the time. And you can use this information, the patient uses it to reinforce whether they're doing the procedure correctly or not, and to focus in on very specific aspects of body function. This can be a very powerful technique for helping some patients with problems like panic attacks, asthma, even helping people who have chronic pain. 

00:07:45
Robert Fried, Ph.D. Director of Biofeedback Albert Ellis Institute 

00:07:45
ROBERT FRIED I can target very specific muscle groups by identifying those in that particular patient which are more tense than others. Furthermore, I can get a relaxation response in five minutes, whereas without instrumentation it requires 20-40 minutes. 

00:08:00
HOWARD TORMAN Robert Fried, a leading researcher in biofeedback, is professor of biopsychology at Hunter College, and Director of the Biofeedback Clinic at the Albert Ellis Institute. 

00:08:10
ROBERT FRIED I have actually treated patients with a wide variety of medical problems. They usually refer to me by physicians and so I know that they're medically, uh, supervised. And I do not treat their medical problem. I treat things associated with the medical problem. I can take a patient with migraine, for instance, who's on a conventional medication regimen for migraine. And a physician will say, as they often do, "Is there something more that this person can do?" And then I would teach them biofeedback, and then perhaps they may be able to reduce their medication. 

00:08:45
HOWARD TORMAN I wanted to try biofeedback myself. 

00:08:45
ROBERT FRIED What I'm going to suggest that we do is that you learn a relaxation response, not the Benson type, which will center on muscle relaxation and breathing. Push your abdomen out slowly as you inhale. Pull your abdomen back as you exhale. Notice after the breathing exercise your oxygen saturation, your, the amount of oxygen that your blood is carrying has risen by over 2%. Notice, also, that your breathing is regular and slow. You have one, two, three, four breaths a minute, which is a very nice yogic breathing pattern. We now have a great deal of research, and that supports empirically what you can do with biofeedback in the treatment of a wide range of disorders. There is, uh, a great deal of variability, but I would like to point out to you that I always tell my patients about that variability. And I tell them, "Look, you know, you're going to learn to do something that may help you. It may not." 

00:09:40
Next: PEDIATRIC HYPNOSIS 

00:09:40
HOWARD TORMAN Next, a look at hypnosis. 

00:09:50
Howard Torman, M.D.Hypnosis is a related therapy that tends to be used for more specific problems than either the relaxation response or biofeedback. Once thought of as a party trick, hypnosis these days is taken much more seriously. In one remarkable study, when a group of people were injected in both arms with a substance that causes an allergic reaction, the reaction in one arm could be stopped just by the use of hypnotic command while the other arm remained red and swollen. In a more practical way, hypnosis is being used to treat a variety of problems from reducing the number and severity of asthma attacks to helping people live with chronic pain. Young Chris Devilla (ph) is one person who's learning to live with his pain. 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN Chris, you gotta hurry up and take your medicine. You got seven minutes. 

00:10:35
HOWARD TORMAN It's morning in the Guererra (ph) household and Julia, like most moms, goes through her daily routine of getting the kids fed and ready for school. But Julia's 8 year-old son, Chris, has a serious kidney problem and that complicates the routine. 

00:10:50
JULIA GUERERRA He's in chronic renal failure right now at this point. Yes, we catheterize at least three, four, five times a day, but he does it on his own. He takes seven different types of medication daily, but eventually he will need a transplant. 

00:11:05
HOWARD TORMAN Once a month, Julia and Chris make the journey from the Bronx to upper Manhattan to visit the medical team that's responsible for keeping Chris alive at Babies and Children's Hospital, part of the New York Presbyterian Medical Center. 

00:11:20
JULIA GUERERRA He's been going there basically all of his life, from the time that he was a year old. Seven years. 

00:11:25
HOWARD TORMAN But Chris' team has now been expanded to now include a hypnotherapist to help him cope with the pain. 

00:11:30
CANDACE ERICKSON Just get yourself comfortable in the chair, and I'm going to teach you something today about how to go into your imagination. Remember . . . 

00:11:40
HOWARD TORMAN The Director of Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics, Candace Erickson, is teaching kids like Chris hypnosis techniques that they can use themselves to help manage the pain of medical treatment. 

00:11:50
Candace J. Erickson, M.D. Dir. Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics, Babies & Children's Hospital 

00:11:50
CANDACE ERICKSON All right. Going into a trance state is really going into an altered state of consciousness, where you're very focused on a certain thought or idea and it usually involves relaxation. 

00:12:00
CANDACE ERICKSON . . . and we're going to go and find that control center in the brain. There are probably several dozens, if not more, different techniques one can use to control pain. There's a switch technique . . . 

00:12:10
HOWARD TORMAN This is Chris' second session with Dr. Erickson. She's teaching him to find an imaginary internal switch that can be used to control signals to his hand. 

00:12:20
CANDACE ERICKSON . . . and look around and find the switch that's for that hand, and let me know when you've found that too. 

00:12:25
HOWARD TORMAN Erickson then presses his hand and tells Chris to adjust the level of pressure he feels by using this imaginary switch. 

00:12:30
CANDACE ERICKSON Now can you turn it back down to normal please, and let me know when you've done that? 

00:12:40
HOWARD TORMAN The idea is to train Chris to use his mind to control signals to the brain, so that with practice he can control the level of pain he experiences. 

00:12:45
CANDACE ERICKSON You can use images around the anesthesia, clouds surrounding it. Imagining your pain getting smaller and smaller, sending it off someplace else. I mean, there are innumerable techniques one can use that can be effective. 

00:13:00
CANDACE ERICKSON . . . and I'd like you to look at the space right between your fingers . . . 

00:13:05
HOWARD TORMAN Hypnosis is not sleep, but rather a state of what's called Attentive Receptive Concentration. Now not everyone can be hypnotized though, and researchers are still at a loss to explain exactly how it works. 

00:13:15
HOWARD TORMAN You can alter someone's perception of pain. Make it so they're not feeling pain. Do we know how that actually is happening? I mean, what's the mechanism there? 

00:13:25
CANDACE ERICKSON I don't kn-, I don't think we know the mechanism. But I would postulate that, uh, we do know that pain is transmitted. That they're a nerve conduction coming from the periphery, that ent-, that comes into the spinal cord. 

00:13:35
HOWARD TORMAN The theory is that at certain intersections in the nervous system, pain signals can be overridden by other signals coming from the cortex of the brain. Simply put, the brain signals overwhelm the pain signals. If you wonder what a hypnotic trance feels like, just think of those times when you've been in your car driving someplace, and you get there and you can't remember how you did it. You have no recollection of turning, driving, or anything. That's what it's like to be under hypnosis. 

00:14:05
HOWARD TORMAN How much does it help? 

00:14:10
CHRIS DEVILLA A lot. 

00:14:10
HOWARD TORMAN A lot? Is it hard to learn those things? 

00:14:15
CHRIS DEVILLA No. 

00:14:15
HOWARD TORMAN No? Pretty easy? Do you think somebody like0] me could learn it? 

00:14:20
CANDACE ERICKSON I actually think it's a very powerful technique and I actually . . . one of the things I find most fascinating about it is I think it's one of our windows into how the mind and body are connected. 

00:14:30
HOWARD TORMAN What about thinking positive thoughts? Having positive images? Can that help relieve some of our ailments? Well, practitioners of guided imagery think that it can. Dr. Karen Koffler, who trained in Andrew Weil's program in integrative medicine, uses guided imagery along with more conventional medical treatments. 

00:14:45
Karen Koffler, M.D. Integrative Medicine Specialist 

00:14:50
KAREN KOFFLER Guided imagery is a powerful tool that we use in the clinic to help, uh, engage the mind and direct the body. 

00:14:55
HOWARD TORMAN While continuing chemotherapy, Deedre Hugo also tries guided imagery. She's coached by Dr. Koffler to visualize a serene tranquil setting. 

00:15:05
KAREN KOFFLER . . . a peaceful, tranquil place where you feel completely relaxed and calm. 

00:15:15
Deedre Hugo PatientFor me, it's usually the desert and I have the cactus there. There might be some natural animals, but it's very quiet and peaceful. Very relaxing. 

00:15:25
KAREN KOFFLER What are you experiencing? 

00:15:30
DEEDRE HUGO Under a tree. 

00:15:30
KAREN KOFFLER Mm-hmm. 

00:15:30
DEEDRE HUGO The sun's shining. 

00:15:35
KAREN KOFFLER Mm-hmm. 

00:15:35
HOWARD TORMAN Once relaxed, patients are often asked to picture their disease as the bad guys and their immune system as the good guys. 

00:15:40
DEEDRE HUGO My bad guy comes to surface and I can see him and we also bring in the immune system, my good guys. 

00:15:50
DEEDRE HUGO I wanna beat him. 

00:15:55
KAREN KOFFLER You do? 

00:15:55
DEEDRE HUGO Not physically, but win the battle. 

00:16:00
HOWARD TORMAN Guided imagery's fairly new to the practice of medicine, but competitive athletes have been using a similar technique for years as a way to improve performance. Olympic skiers, like gold medalist Picabo Street, are trained to stand at the top of the course and envision that perfect line down the mountain. Bobsledders also can be seen at the top of the run with their eyes closed, twisting their hands and bodies in kind of a surreal ballet. It's all a mental rehearsal of the perfect line the sled has to take down the run. And these athletes believe, and experience shows, that in the heat of competition the mind can precondition the body to almost react automatically. Although some characterized guided imagery is nothing more than wishful thinking, it is being used increasingly in some hospitals, primarily to offset the pain and side effects of cancer treatments. We're now joined by Dr. Kenneth Pelletier, a clinical psychologist, and an associate clinical professor of medicine here at Stanford. He's also the author of successful books: Sound Mind/Sound Body and The Best Alternative Medicine. 

00:17:05
HOWARD TORMAN Nice to have you. 

00:17:05
KENNETH PELLETIER Thank you. 

00:17:05
HOWARD TORMAN Curious. What do you make of this whole mind/ body medicine? 

00:17:10
Dr. Kenneth R. Pelletier Stanford University School of Medicine 

00:17:10
KENNETH PELLETIER Well when you look at the mind/body medicine area, it actually has some of the best research base, uh, for the largest number of patients for the largest number of conditions. So it's actually one of the areas of alternative medicine that probably has the soundest, uh, research basis. Right now probably of all the areas of, uh, alternative medicine. Uh, you see mind/body medicine most often represented in clinics, um, hospitals, here at the Stanford Complementary Medicine Clinic. Um, you find that those are interventions are being accepted partially because they're ind-, they're effective in and of themselves, but they're great adjuncts to other forms of treatment: postoperatively, or with cancer patients, heart patients. So both as a stand alone interventions, but as adjuncts. Then they become, uh, really an invaluable part of conventional care. 

00:18:00
HOWARD TORMAN What's the downside there, or is there a downside? 

00:18:05
KENNETH PELLETIER There actually, there are quite a few downsides. Certainly one is blaming the victim, that making a person feel badly because somehow they cannot, uh, achieve this mind/body, uh, regulation. Uh, also it can promise, in fact, too much for a person, or be seen as, um, um, offering perhaps more promise than it can, uh, deliver. 

00:18:25
HOWARD TORMAN How is a patient or the average person out there supposed to differentiate, or can they differentiate between somebody who really has a useful technique versus someone that's really out there in the fringe and perhaps not as reliable? 

00:18:40
KENNETH PELLETIER Well, that's an excellent question. Certainly the aphorism that if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is, is absolutely true not only in mind/body medicine, but in the whole domain of alternative medicine. So that's one. Uh, secondly, you can find these kinds of practices at, at Harvard, at, at Stanford, at very, very good schools and clinics and hospitals. So there's no need to go outside of the mainstream to find these kinds of, uh, services being offered, and, and that's really of great use to, to patients. 

00:19:10
HOWARD TORMAN What's the relationship of the placebo response to a lot of what we see going on in mind/body medicine? Maybe we should define it first so that . . . 

00:19:15
KENNETH PELLETIER Sure. 

00:19:15
HOWARD TORMAN . . . folks understand what we're talking about. 

00:19:15
KENNETH PELLETIER Um, placebo is latin for "I will please", and it's, refers generally to either an inner pill or a procedure that, in fact, is not effective. And it's used in, in research to compare, uh, is the intervention real versus a placebo, or supposedly imaginary effect. 

00:19:35
HOWARD TORMAN So you give em a, you give em a fake treatment basically, and some of the patients get better even on the fake treatment. 

00:19:40
KENNETH PELLETIER Correct. And that wh-, that observation is what is most important. If you look at virtually all the pharmaceutical studies, somewhere between 10 and as much as 30% of the response is attributed to placebo. Now, that's rather astounding. But if you take all of the pharmaceutical studies collectively and add up the various placebo responses, you find that placebo may be one of most e-, thera-, uh, most effective therapeutic interventions that we have. 

00:20:00
HOWARD TORMAN So what's its role in mind/body techniques? 

00:20:05
KENNETH PELLETIER There is undoubtedly an element of placebo response in all of the mind/body interventions. But some of the new research now is beginning to think about, rather than eliminating placebo response as a contamination, why don't we find ways to enhance it? How do you elicit a person's sense of hope, uh, a person's sense of active participation, cooperation, activity, empowerment. And that's really a new trend. How do we enhance, deliberately enhance the placebo response? 

00:20:30
HOWARD TORMAN You know, we've spent the longest time trying to eliminate the placebo response from things that we do in medicine. Why haven't we taken advantage of it before? 

00:20:35
KENNETH PELLETIER Um, I think placebo response was a negative before, because we're dealing with very specific diseases that could be treated with pharmaceuticals and surgery. But in chronic disease you're dealing with lifestyle changes and lifestyle changes require that the person be actively involved with you in the treatment and, therefore, the placebo response, or how do you more actively engage that person to help you get a positive outcome, has begun to be taken a lot more seriously. What we're doing in mind/body medicine is finding ways to maximize that: to use biofeedback instruments, to use training, to use lifestyle changes, to use hypnosis and autohypnosis. These various kinds of techniques, including meditation. So we take the baseline of placebo response, but really greatly enhance that, and deliberately enhance that with the active participation of the person. 

00:21:25
HOWARD TORMAN Do you worry at all about, kind of, the spectrum that we have in mind/body medicine. I mean, out of the one hand you have the Stanford's and Harvard's of the world doing this down and dirty lab research, trying to really pin it down. In the other hand, you've got some people that, you know, in Sedona or wherever, who are just, kind of, you know, playing the mystic role. Or are they really, or are they really part of the same spectrum, or are they in two different worlds? 

00:21:45
KENNETH PELLETIER To some degree they're in two different worlds. Uh, much of what we see now being taken seriously and studied wh-, was perhaps a fringe practice. Meditative practices or abilities to control autonomic functions, bleeding and, and pain, that were thought to be, uh, myths, and, in fact, are now demonstrated to be, to be accurate, to be true. I think one of the other phenomenon in terms of, uh, do the proselytizing end of the continuum speak with researchers. Unfortunately, not too often. Um, we found an interesting, uh, problem where people practicing alternative medicine or mind/body medicine are perhaps more threatened by the research than, than they should be. Um, if we really all see . . . 

00:22:25
HOWARD TORMAN You think they'd embrace it. They'd say, "Wow, this is great. Cool. See, you're proving what I believed all along." But that doesn't happen. 

00:22:30
KENNETH PELLETIER Well, you also risk that you may be proven wrong. Um, to me what's interesting is when a particular meditation technique or mind/body intervention is demonstrably effective, there's a ss-, smug ss-, smile and a nod like, "See, we told you." So, but in reality what they've forgotten is over the hundreds, if not thousands, of years of all the techniques that are proven not to work. And so we need to remember both, that there probably are techniques within this continuum, within this group of practices that do work. There are others which are gonna be proven to be false, and you need courage on both sides to enter into that domain. 

00:23:00
HOWARD TORMAN Thanks, Dr. Pelletier. 

00:23:05
HOWARD TORMAN Curing disease strictly by using mind/body techniques is probably an unrealistic goal. On the other hand, though, studying this area is giving us great insight into how the body works, and that's certainly a value. And there's already good evidence that some patients are using mind/body techniques to help them cope successfully with their medical problems and deal with more conventional therapies. That's not necessarily a bad thing.
