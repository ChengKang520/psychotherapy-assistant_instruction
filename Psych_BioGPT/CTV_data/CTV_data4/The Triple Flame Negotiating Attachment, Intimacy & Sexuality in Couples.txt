ESTHER PEREL Good morning, everyone. 

00:01:00
Esther Perel, MA, LMFT 

00:01:00
ESTHER PEREL  I told my Southern husband that, one day I would try to give a talk with a southern accent. 

00:01:15

00:01:20
ESTHER PEREL “Wild Things in Captivity. Wild things in captivity while they leap. And while they keep their own wild purity won’t breath, they mope, they die. All men are in captivity, active with captive activity, and the best won’t breed, though they don’t know why. The great cage of our domesticity kills sex in a man, the simplicity of desire is distorted and twisted awry. And so, with bitter perversity, gritting against the great adversity, they young ones copulate, hate it, and want to cry. Sex is a state of grace. In a cage, it can’t take place. Break the cage then, start in and try.” D.H. Lawrence. 

00:02:20

00:02:25
ESTHER PEREL And to introduce us to reconciling attachment security and erotic life, “the original primordial fire of eroticism is sexuality; it raises the red flame of eroticism, which in turn raises and feeds another flame, tremulous and blue. It is the flame of love and eroticism. The double flame of life.” Octavio Paz. So, I want to first thank you all for inviting me to talk with you this morning and to Jeff and to Allen and to meeting the wonderful faculty of the conference. And the story of sex in modern couples often tells of dwindling desire. And it includes a long list of sexual alibis that are claiming to explain the inescapable death of errors. People talk about being stressed, people talk about being tired, people talk about having bad relationships, being in conflict too much, we try to invoke a lot of reasons for why it is impossible for us to integrate passion, intimacy and commitment; the triple flame, all at once. In my practice, I see young, I see old, I see married, I see living together, I see gay, I see straight, and I see people who place themselves on a whole spectrum of sexual fluidity and they often come in with the same complaint, we love each other very much, we have no sex. So, I began to ask a number of questions, why those good sex so often fade in couples who continue to love each other as much as ever. It wouldn’t be interesting to think about people who constant each other and don’t want to touch each other, even though that’s not always the case. But people who come in saying, I love her very much, I don’t desire her; I know he loves me or she loves me dearly, it’s been years since I felt wanted; and they know the difference. So, I ask the second question, why is it that we have this notion that, you know, a relationship seemingly this is a kind of a stereotypic model start in a state of passion, start in a limerent phase and then passion has only one way to go and that’s always down. Maybe sometimes it actually grows, grows as people grow internally, grow with their own sexual self-awareness with their own maturity of connection rather than the story of decline continuously. Why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex? And then people would say, but maybe it’s not good intimacy but no, maybe something in the way that we love isn’t necessarily the same in the way that we desire. And then I ask myself why the sex make babies and babies spell erotic disaster in couples? It's kind of the fatal erotic blow, isn't it? Or why is the forbidden so erotic? Why is it that when people can actually do what they want, they don’t feel like doing it, because it becomes no longer linked to certain forces -- a certain force and a certain level of transgression that seems to be so connected to erotic life. When we love, how does it feel? And when we desire how is it different? So timing again, I hear people describe the paradoxical relationship between domesticity and sexual desire and sometimes relenting at the fact that, maybe it isn’t always the lack of closeness that stifles desire, but too much closeness. So, what kind of too much could there be? So, I’ve set out to probe the nature of -- oh this is a much better sound, how we’re going to do that, let’s see if I can, is that better? 

00:06:30
 Yes. 

00:06:30
ESTHER PEREL Okay, you know, what we’re going to do. And now? 

00:06:35
  Yes. 

00:06:40
ESTHER PEREL And now? 

00:06:40
 Yeah. 

00:06:40
ESTHER PEREL Basically it says, I’m forced to read, I’m going to do this like that. Alright so, I said out to probe the nature of erotic desire in long term relationships; To explore the cultural forces that shape domesticated sex; To take on this Gordian knot of sexuality and intimacy; And mostly to explore the obstacles and anxieties that arise when our pursuit of security and stability clashes with our quest for passion and adventure. Yes, I do speak nine languages, and so it is a part of me to think very much in multicultural ways and in terms of thinking in multicultural, always I think it also implies thinking historically a little bit, how is it that we take it for granted that we should be able to have one relationship in which we will feel secure, close, connected and turned on, all at once, with the same person and we live twice as long. So, that was not always a given. No, this isn’t going to work, because I do need to move. Alright, but a few things have happened to the institution of marriage that I just want to sketch so that we get a context for why we think the way we think, Couples Therapy takes place at a certain time in history and in certain geographies and the thoughts and the attitudes and the expectations are not always the same. So, this institution of marriage has undergone an extreme make over in the last century. You know, historically one would say that the passion of the marriage would have been an oxymoron, the contradiction in terms, matrimony was primarily of an economic institution for sustenance, for family life, for respectability, for succession, for companionship; and the family and the community offer the much needed sense of belonging and continuity. But then modernity assured in a marriage that is a romantic arrangement, that Harvell talked about yesterday as well, where commitments are build on love and where trust and affection have become the sustainable energy. Romance and passion are at the center of the marital plot. And then we have on the sexual front also a set of revolutions that take place. It was starting pretty much in the West in the 60s, you know, mostly -- the most important change in terms of sexuality and in terms of sexuality in long term relationships is the democratization of the contraception pill. And that liberated sex from its soul biological purpose and that liberated women from fear of pregnancy and mortality that was so often linked to sexuality. Feminism and gay pride that increasingly defined sexual expression as an inalienable right, in most places, sexuality is not yet a right for women, it is a duty, it is not about pleasure and it’s not about choice and it’s not an expression of who they are, and it certainly not an expression of what pleases them. Today, our sexuality in the West has become a matter of our identity, it’s a part of who we are, it’s a property of the self, something that we define that’s a project over our lifetime in which we come to see what -- who we are in there, what we like in there, what it means for us, it’s a phenomenology of sex, rather than it’s a condition of who we are and that’s something that we do. And so, I began to really shift my thinking, you know, sex is not the something you do, it’s a place you go and it’s a place that you go inside yourself and with another or others. But inside yourself what parts of you -- do you go to seek there, do you meet there, do you connect there. When you are on top of the mountain, what do it mean for you, where do you reach, you know, what parts of you do you reach there, when you are inside this deep ocean called your sexuality, what do you find there at the bottom, and that's a whole different question that most of us in history didn’t really get to ask and certainly not in such a democratized way. So, sex that becomes a central feature of intimate relationships and satisfaction, sexual satisfaction that becomes our do, you know, we first sexualize love -- we’ll first bring love to marriage, then we sexualize love, then we link for the first time ever, marital happiness with sexual satisfaction, unheard of. And then we did something that never had been done, which was we brought down happiness from the heaven, say, it used to be for the afterlife, then it became a man, you know, then we brought it down, then it became a possibility and now it’s a mandate. You know, never in history have people said that the first thing want for their children is to be happy. So, this concept of happiness is an enormous amount of expectations, never have people invested more in love and never have their split up more in the name of love. And those are the people that we see in our offices who want a better relationship. 

00:12:05
[sil.] 

00:12:10
ESTHER PEREL In fact, it would say that, you know, it’s this very investment in the -- for the men and women that I work with, where love and happiness and sexuality are so connected being secure in the same relationship as the one in which you can have the adventure. What starts to happen is this. We have tried to reconcile in one relationship, love and desire. The paradox of intimacy and sexuality which is really a paradox in which we are trying to reconcile, what Steve and Mitchell would call, two fundamental sets of human needs. On the one hand, our need for security, for stability, for predictability, for reliability, for dependability, for permanence, all these anchoring, grounding experiences of our life. But we also want with the same person, adventure, novelty, mystery, change, risk, unexpected, surprise, all in one. And we think it’s our do. Now these two sets of fundamental human needs, security and adventure, they sometimes bring from different forces and pull us in different directions, it is not so given that they actually always belong together, some people experience them more seamlessly intertwined and for some people they often are actually rather disconnected. So, how we integrated bond and freedom or autonomy and connection or dependency and agency or closeness and separateness or togetherness and sameness versus differentiation? To me, these all allude to the same duality, to the same tension, that we are trying to reconcile in modern love today. I’m giving you a series of names, because every theoretical framework has chosen its names to name sometimes the same two forces. Systemically when we used to be train, it was about change and homeostasis. But the main thing is this, everybody needs both. It’s not a privilege of man or of women to want one more or the other. We all need security and adventure but some of us come out of childhood with a greater need for security and some of us come out of our childhood with a greater need for space and freedom and adventure and we often seem to mate with the person for whom their proclivities are our vulnerabilities. They will teach us something. So, we seek to balance the separateness and this in connection or dis-bonding, dis-attachment and our ability to move away to be free pretty much from childhood. But I would say that in the tension between love and desire, you could look at it like that, if attachment is a precondition for independence, then separateness is a precondition for connection. What one works very hard to close, the other one will want to open up as a new space and then bring life into it and that’s what I want to develop with you. Now, I want to separate something, because I know that we could the attachment security and sexuality but in fact I would like to replace sexuality with eroticism because it will speak to us a lot more and we will understand what couples actually are longing for. Animals have sex. It is the pivot, it is biology, it is nature, it is the primordial, but we are the only ones that have an erotic life. We can make love to someone, have multiple orgasms, be in a complete state of exotic bliss and touch absolutely no one, just because we can imagine it. We are daunted with that thing called the central agent of the erotic, which is our imagination, our ability to anticipate, to foresee, to see ourselves in a situation to project ourselves. Eroticism is the metaphor of sexuality. It is sexuality that is socialized or that is socialized and metaphorized by the human imagination. And in that sense it is in-limited, it is infinite, it is bedded in ceremony and rituals, but even our most solitary pleasures are always plural. They are always connected to someone, they all -- even if it’s another someone that is another version of ourselves. In eroticism, pleasure is the end for itself, it its own goal, there is no procreation linked to eroticism. So, you don’t need the active sex in the erotic experience, even though it’s often hinted act, which is very important because then we get away from the whole notion of sex as performance and sex as frequency. We enter into something that is a much more radiant interlude, you don’t accomplish anything with eroticism, it’s mightily unproductive. But what it is, is a quality of aliveness, it’s the mystical sense of the word of vibrancy, of vitality and the way I began to think about why this was so important for me to make the distinction was this, my husband works in the -- directs the International Trauma Studies program. He works with torture victims, you know, victims of war. You know, we always say that I do pleasure and he does pain. But they meet and they meet in a very important place because then I ask him one day, how do you know when trauma leaves its place from just being death and the person goes back to life, how do you know when the person crosses that line again and starts to live again, to be alive again. And then we began to talk about what it means when you are able once again to play to experience pleasure to be curious, to be in a state of discovery of exploration. And then I made the connection to my own childhood, when I grew up in Antwerp in Belgium and -- 

00:18:45
[sil.] 

00:18:50
ESTHER PEREL There were -- I grew up in a community that was all holocaust survivors, so was my family. And in my community there were two groups of people, those who didn’t die and those who came back to life. You can apply this to trauma all the time; you can also apply this to couples. Those who didn’t die where people who lived rather treated to the ground, very afraid, no willingness towards leap out into the world anymore, because too fearful of the consequences and in a state of vigilance and neither could the experience pleasure nor their children. Because to experience pleasure you have to have a minimum of unselfconsciousness and care freeness, any vigilance, any fear, any anxiety precludes pleasure and that is a golden rule for sexuality. But the people who came back to life where the people who kind of had understood how to keep themselves a life, how to understand the erotic as a force to beat back deadness, which is what I think many couples come to us for. Many of them when they complain about the listlessness of their sex life, they don’t just want more sex, they want better sex, and the better that we are talking about is to reconnect with the quality of aliveness and vibrancy and renewal and playfulness that sex wants to afford them or that they think maybe one day they could find there. People come with a earning to feel alive, people will often act with exuberant defiance as in all the range of infidelities to beat back the deadness. And that’s where the connection and the erotic intimacy brings the space where this could all be experienced. Now, if you think about this idea of reconciling these two sets of needs, it may feel like, how does one do that, but then if you look at this early experience with attachment, there is a certain model that can be helpful in understanding why for some people this movement is easier than others. Imagine the little kid that sits on your lap. And if everything is fine, he is cozy and she is cozy and cuddled and, you know, well nested and well rested. And if all goes well in the history of human development, at some point that little child needs to leave the lap, jump off and go out into the world. See, my emphasis is going to be on the movement away, because I’m looking at desire and how it can then link itself with attachment, not the other way around. That little kid leaves and goes into the world to play, to be curious to be exploratory and I owed to hovel to now put the world curiosity back. I always say discovery and exploration with curiosity has it better. But then the little kid turns around and looks at the adult and if the adult here says, kiddo the world is a great place, have fun; there is so much to discover, I’m here anytime. What does the little child do? Turns away and goes further and experiences at the same time, security and adventure. A secure attachment and an ability to leave and a separateness and goes there until they have enough and when they are associated, they come back and they plug themselves again. In adult life, this is the dance of being able to make love to the person you love. But if the little kid turns around and there is an adult here, that says, I’m lonely, I’m anxious, I’m worried, my partner hasn’t paid any attention to me and god knows how long, I need you but never stated, you know, what’s so great out there don’t we have everything we need, just you and I baby. Then the kid has a few options. Option number one, which is an option we see a lot in our offices, is that, the kid comes right back and he or she will understand that in order not to lose you, I will lose a part of me. I will forgo my freedom to secure our connection. And those often will become the people for who making love to the person they love will become more and more difficult, reconciling sexuality and intimacy or love and desire will become more difficult. Will become more difficult because, the way they learn to love becomes such that it precludes the ability to leave to be playful curious exploratory I need to enter into themselves all the way being in the presence of another, which is what love making is often about. It’s this ability to be at the same time inside of me and what you are inside of you and with me. The second little kid will look over and the adult will say the same thing, but it’s a little child that is assessed and doesn’t want to immediately come back but lives the life like this, are you okay, you won’t be angry, you won’t collapse on, you won’t scold me when I come back, you won’t be depressed, and that is often a person who earlier on has an easier time reconciling love and security together with adventure and desire until the closeness starts to preclude it, why because they start to learn that love comes with this, all love has mutuality, reciprocity, a feeling of care and responsibility for the well-being of others, but some of us have learnt to live that with a little extra. A little excess responsibility, excess burden, excess worry for the well-being of the other, so much so that when I care and love you I can’t leave you to actually go inside myself for those who were in the workshop yesterday afternoon, the women that didn’t have an orgasm for 22 years, that’s an example. If you can’t at some point be safe enough to be just inside yourself you never come, physiologically impossible. The third child just doesn’t come back, because there is nothing to come back to, may have lustful lives and lot’s of passion but lot’s of instability. So, what you will keep in mind is this, tell me how you were loved, and I’ll tell you how you make love. It’s not just tell me how you were loved, and I’ll tell you how you love, that translation we all know. What we don’t yet know enough of is, how that storyline translates itself into the physicality of sex, how our body, we understand how the body maintains the story but we don’t know how that body then translate that story when it tries to be physical, sensual, sexual and first and foremost experience pleasure with someone. So, why does desire, why does passion so often fade was the first question, right? And then if you go back to that tension between love and desire, one way and, you know, the perverts have dealt with this for the time immemorial, there is absolutely no way that even though I always would stake like, it’s I -- I may sound very confident but I’m not sure of anything. You know, I’m filled with perversity that tries to deal with that same tension, but the few of them have alluded to something that’s very similar and I say the perverts because they have had more to say about love and sex than psychology, certainly than Couples Therapy. But if love is about having and love wants to contract the distance and to minimize the tension and to contain the unknown and we talk so often about being know, being seen, being penetrated by the other person who is deeply curious about who we are, if it wants to collapse the gap, if it seeks closeness and all of that knowing of the beloved desire takes place in a different space. It wants to go generally where it hasn’t yet gone. It doesn’t particularly respond well to the predictable, it likes the discovery, the surprise, it needs space to thrive. And when I say that it needs space to thrive, it needs otherness, it needs a bridge to cross with somebody to visit on the other side if you are already inside each other the whole day, you don’t really feel like going anymore further at night. You need a space in between to have an alarm. And then I’ve started to ask myself but how do I know that, because I ask a question that I have taken worldwide and the most interesting thing about it is totally not cross-cultural. I’m most drawn to my partner when? Not that most attracted sexually? I’m most drawn to my partner when? So, yell out a few people, let see what -- how you would. I’m most drawn to my partner when? 

00:28:15

ESTHER PEREL When he express it, okay listen people, listen to what I'm going to try to describe to you, when I was in Cuba recently, there was a few, it was about the hundred Cubans and a hundred Americans. And then one of the American women also talked about the dishes and the Cubans looked like that. That is actually a very, they are cultural things this one is one of them. But then one of the Cuban women says in her late sixties mind you, you know nothing and you know they have nothing and they still showed up their, I mean she says oh, I'm drawn to my partner when I think of another. And then another Cuban women says, oh, I'm drawn to my partner when I'm with another. And the rest of the room, ah. So there is only one here generally by the way that is gender specific. And you guys have didn't mentioned this, this one, but you know it, it’s when the women say when I see him playing with the kids. That is usually, it was said, it was said, okay it was said it has been correct, I stand corrected and that one is the only one that is gender specific actually, all the others, but listen to what the music says, okay. I'm drawn to my partner when he or she surprises me. When he takes charge, when I'm turned on, myself, when I'm in touch with my own erotic self. When he or she is vulnerable, its more often a she is saying when he is vulnerable, but in fact you can translate the vulnerability in that statement as because it is surprising and not the usual. It’s not just the quality, but the quality is beautiful because it takes you to a different place than the space that person inhabits generally. When he is loving. When he or she smiles is a big one, dancing is a big one, watching the other person play an instrument is a big one. Basically watching the other person pleasure themselves, but in the full sense of the word watching the other person do something that they are good at, I'd like to do are in their element and are passionate about. But look at my hand, in order to watch another one, by the way if you go like this you can't see another one. Your cross eye. And if they are too far away you can't see them anymore either. So you need them to be in a particular kind of distance that combines comfort secure attachment and enough space to be able to notice something that is different and that is new. In this space, between me and the other lies the erotic love. The couples who manage to modulate that space, who can play that accordion are often erotic couples and erotic couples means they have sex, but that doesn't mean they have a lauder frequent or long-lasting or acrobatic sex, it means they are alive and they're erotic sexually and as a couple. This person, that you see on stage or this person that is doing something of their own, or the person that is beautiful or that is coming out of the shower or that plays the violin or that sees things about me that are unique, that I'm not always noticed by others that pays attention that is focused that is present, this is never another single one of the description even when they are nice to your parents or bring the vitamins, or do nice things for you, this is not about a kind of emotional care taking that is burdened. Care taking is part of love. It isn’t really part of desire. Desire to take place needs to feel that the other person is sustaining themselves, there is no dependency in the script of desire. In the best sense that it exists in the experience of love, which is why the kid that comes back early on and learns to love in a certain way that comes with that excess burden and responsibility finds it hard to be able to live enough to enter themselves to be able to experience love and sex at the same time and to integrate it. There is nobody in any of your descriptions who need you to rescue them. Who need you to lift them, what is so beautiful when you watch them play the guitar is that they could, they are totally in a realm of their own. When they cultivate the flowers, when they work in the garden, when they dress up even if they do it for you and this and everything else that you describe has to with an element of surprise, with an element of benevolence, with an element of novelty, with an element of adventure, it’s not the usual. So we had some of you who would also talked about the way from the children and all of that. So that's when I say, that the desire needs space to thrive, it needs another bridge to cross and somebody to visit on the other side. In the Talmud there is a powerful sentence that talks about how all of life is a narrow bridge and the most important thing is not to be afraid to cross it. There is no safe sex. You always are vulnerable when you cross that bridge, but you find there riches and marvels that they're often unmet any other place. So why is it so difficult to understand that fire needs air to reconcile these forces because one of the things that I think has happened is that in this passage where we left the villages and we brought in the industrialization and romanticism and we started to have love relationships that are in the choosing you and you choose me and all of that, a few things happened. In the traditional system, which is a traditional system of many countries in the world, societies in the world still, where there is no really that concept of self, you belong to a group and your sense of identity, identification continuity and anchoring is given to you by that group, but when you leave that group and you enter the era or individualism, which is the one that we live in, basically you start to turn to one person to give you what once an entire village use to provide. We're not more insecure today, than we ever were before, but we're bringing all our security needs to one person. And that is compounding the expectations. When you bring all of your security needs to one person you often start to need them in a certain way that will preclude the erotic vitality and the elements that are necessary to maintain eroticism in the same relationship. And so that's one piece. If you bring all these insecurities to one person, you run the risk some times to sap the erotic vitality out of your relationship most couples that are erotic couples and it’s integrated with a deep sense of secure attachment are also people who you will notice are very connected with others, they have friends, they have family, and they have community. They are not isolated units. We sometimes will sacrifice passion for security. Now the interesting thing about that is, that we do believe that there is such a thing, there is a quest for it, there is an absolute need for it, but all of the eastern world understands that maybe what is predictable and is actually that everything is in flux. That permanence is at best an illusion. And so maybe we could say, you know we tent in our feel to kind of disparage passion a little bit, we think it’s for the immature and the same sense of the neurotics. And that you should grow up, when you grow up, you kind of, we move passion for something that is more tame, more long-lasting, more injuring because we don't anymore see passion as that sense of aliveness, we have kind of cheapened it a little bit, but then when you replace passion for security, might we not think that we're just replacing one fiction for another, because anyone who has ever loved knows that love comes with the fear of loss. Love is always in its essence vulnerable, everyone who has had a child knows that. You can do all kinds of things to try to bring in mechanisms to secure it, but in enough itself, the moment you attach, you live with the fear of the detach. That I know is not necessarily the popular view of the day in our field, where we really want to believe that we can create that kind of attachment, but it is interesting that it is the society where people are most isolated in the world where attachment theory has become so prolific. That doesn't mean that the need for secure attachment isn't wired layered, and but there is a context for that, it is a context for why there is at the same time such a high demand for sexuality in relationships and such a high collapse of sexuality in intimate relationships. There is no topic that gets more advice us to how to get the fire back, but the fire needs air, and before that you need a flame. So you need to work at getting the flame and then you need to create the air so that the flame can last. But what happens is that, people sometimes when confuse intimacy with merging, and we'll ask so much from one person to give me at the same time my belonging, my connection, my rootedness, my continuity, my predictability and my novelty comfort and edge at the same time, it’s kind of difficult to want at the same time to know that this is the position, you know I don't have a chair here, but this is comfort. It’s a sofa in which you sit that is so cozy, so known, so familiar, you don't have to prove anything here, you don't have to do anything here, you're so accepted, but this is the position of curiosity of the erotic. It’s a position that goes to look out, but here is the trick, desire is fueled by that unknown and by that mystery and by that novelty and surprise and all of the stuff you said. Some of us, seem to have a hard time tolerating that unknown in the midst of the place where we seek the secure attachment and the security. Its difficult for us, but we can experience it perfectly fine outside because for some of us, the unknown is really anxiety producing and so I would rather you become a known entity fixed that is reliable don't change on me, rather than to be open to the unknown of this other person that seriously people we never know the one who lives next to us till the day they die, and don't wait till they cheat to find that out, but it’s a beautiful thing that little edge, that little edge of a known is really where the erotic is large between fear and fascination. You know there is a sentence that Tony Robbins sometimes uses I'm going to bastardise his, but it says something to it, that says passion is commensurate with the amount of uncertainty we can tolerate. Now for some of us, we have enough trouble in our live that we don't want passion. We're very, very happy, having a secure relationship where I can rely on and be predictable with my partner, but if we want that other dimension it requires our ability to still leave and go into the world like the little child who goes to play and our ability to cherish when our partner does that too. And not to say again you have to go. You know what's so good out there? So, basically to sustain and elan vital, to sustain a vital they needs to be a synapse to cross. It’s all the time that movement. Am I doing. Oh, I'm good. Now, eroticism is the poetry of the body. The testimony of the senses, like a poem, it isn't linear, it may enters and twists back on itself. It shows us that we do not see with our eyes, but in the eyes of our spirit. Eroticism reveals us to another world inside the world. The senses becomes servants of the imagination and let us see the invisible and hear the inaudible. That work on sexuality in a relationship isn't evidence based. So what about, because it’s okay, you got it. So what about, tell me how you were loved and I'll tell you how you make love? What is it about the shaping of our erotic blueprints. With whom did you learn to love and how, where you protected by the people who I meant to protect you or did you have to flee for protection. Where you allowed to have needs, and where they noticed as in somebody knows you need your vitamins, as in somebody knows to bring you something that is important to you or where they denied. Where they invisible, or where they really acknowledged, but then you were told you don't need this, what do you need that for, you have enough, which was the message of the unorgasmic women yesterday on our tape. Where you allowed to thrive or where you constantly made to just stay compact, contract yourself, closing inside this body like that. Where you allowed to, where you given to or where you denied, did you receive, where you held, where you rocked, where you sued or where you violated, where you kicked, where you invaded, where you hurt, did you learn not to expect too much, was it okay to have pleasure, or what's pleasure in and itself not a value it was a denigrated commodity, did you learn to hide when you were upset, and to cry quietly you know it’s when people have learnt to shutdown and to cry quietly it’s like, they do like this, we think it’s very strange, right to last like that without the sound. But there are people who make love without the sound. That takes a whole programming system. I'm not talking about talking and making loud noises and just there is a way in which you don't even know that's something is happening to them. Its imperceptible, it’s like a baby that's born without screaming. So tell me how you were loved, says that the psychology of our desire is buried into details of our childhood, in our history of attachment and our attachment orientation later on and how it will translate itself into the physicality of sex, our emotional history is imprinted on our bodies, but not just the body in pain, but also the body that seeks bliss. And that is what, you know, our field has often talked about the body, but mostly the wounded body, it doesn't try to see what is that other body, the body that is connected and experiences pleasure and takes the body as a language for itself. And why this is important actually because you know we're supposedly the talking cure or even if we're the listening cure it’s still is focus on words. And we're a Christian society and therefore, we also have looked at the body a secondary, but we speak with our bodies for a year and half before we utter the first word. And it is our second language, if intimacy is going to become so paramount in modern love, we'd better be at least bilingual. And that means that we not think we need to first get close and we get close by talking to then be able to bring those bodies to be close for some of us the body is the venue to which we express the same kind of closeness than the other and let's not polarize in the couple that one person wants intimacy and the other person wants sex. Sex is intimacy and intimacy can be sexual. They are part of the same thing. They are expressed in a different language, so this body I'm studying it as to read the text, and the text of the attachment and how it is written on the body, how the body thrives to only have sex a way to become connected as a way to secure the presence of the other, but doesn't actually like sex. It doesn't really like the experience. It cooks because it knows it needs to prepare food, we were talking about the mother yesterday evening who every time that she cooked for her children was actually talking about how burden she was by having to be a mother. That's poisonous food, it's the same sexually. Many of our deepest fears and persistent longings emerge in intimate sex. The immensity of our neediness, the fear of dissertation, the terror of being engulfed, the earning of omnipotence. If you look at sexuality as that text, tell me how you're sexually and I'll will know a heck of a lot about you. Our sexual preferences arise from these very thrills and challenges and conflicts of our early life. Our erotic impulses however, our erotic mind have the unique capacity to transform to undo and to avenge those very same traumas and hurts and frustrations and challenges that we face growing up into sources of excitation and pleasure that is why the erotic mind and the erotic imagination as a transformation machine is so vital, so important for us, but the erotic landscape is a lot vaster and richer and more intricate than the physiology of sex or any repertoire of sexual techniques. It’s not so important to ask you couples do you have sex and how often. So you get a sense if it’s an important part of their life, people have had sex for centuries, women know it all too well and felt absolutely nothing. Doing it isn't the goal, but letting it become a space in which peoples most deepest wishes needs, earnings, longings can become expressed then it becomes an important expression of intimacy and erotic intimacy as an intimacy and aliveness combined. Erotic intimacy is about using sexuality to disclose those core aspects of ourselves. Our dependency, our neediness, our vulnerability, our aggression and all the kinds of sex are just there to give voice to these parts of us. From S&M to any to BDSM, to any fore-seduction, to any nature, to any outside, to any vital reason, to any just tender loving sex, to any spiritual bonding to any tantric practices, it's always will be an integration between the secure attachment and the sexuality when it becomes a space where we can express the core aspects of ourselves to another in full view. It’s the self confrontation and an expression of our eroticism to another person and most importantly it combines generosity and self-centeredness. It’s the double promise of mutuality and selfishness. You can't have good sex without that minimum moment of selfishness. So therefore you need to know that it is okay, to turn away from another to be intend entirely inside yourself and that dual stands between generous and self-centered is really key. In that space, we will connect with the terror of obliteration and the experience of separateness without the terror of abandonment because many times you know in relationships you have the person who is afraid to lose the other and the person who is afraid to lose themselves. The same thing happens in sex, but in that meeting, you finally can enter the other without being afraid that they will never come out and you can have the other one enter you without being afraid that you won't be there when they leave. And I'm not talking about orifices, I'm talking about entering the whole person. It’s this momentary oneness that comes from our ability to acknowledge the indissoluble separateness, it’s this both end, erotic intimacy is the space where we can transcend the civility of our emotional connection and unleash the unruly impulses and the primary appetites. And in the interest of time, I will conclude with this, describing her as alluring and with a strong personality he said, if you look deep into her eyes there is a certain vulnerability in any case I see it even if the most don't realize it. She goes through life tall, beautiful, confident, very able. There is a part of her, that is fragile, young, sometimes scared and I think these are contradictions that attracted me to her. And she makes me very happy. She is very familiar to me and so I can be myself around her. She knows me well. I completely trust her, but at the same time, in certain respects she remains a mystery to me. Sometimes, when we're lying together he says, I look at her and I feel dizzy with the realization that here is another distinct person from me, who has memories, origins, faults, feelings that are different from my own. That's tension between familiarity and mystery meshes something strong between us. Even if one builds a life together based on trust, attentiveness and mutual support. I think it’s important that the partner continues to surprise. And who is it? Obama. Thank you. Thank you.
