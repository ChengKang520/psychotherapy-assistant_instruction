STOP BULLYING WITH MIKE HALL 

00:00:20
MIKE All of us are a bully, sometimes to somebody. Some of us just do it a whole lot more than others. There are three main places that this bullying comes from. The first would be that we feel a lack of control, either at home or maybe even in the locker room. 

00:00:35
HELP 

00:00:40
UNKNOWN The person that's bullying them is like, there's like… they have their, their life is rough and they wanna like bully somebody, to make them feel good. 

00:00:45
UNKNOWN They feel more power over the other person when they're mean to them. 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN Because they have low uh… self-esteem. 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN Like they kind of want to get themselves almost up to a higher level 'cause they don't feel like they're at one. 

00:01:00
UNKNOWN Just to think they're cool or like to unhappiness at home, somebody passed away, they feel bad. And they just wanna get their anger out on somebody, instead, even though that person they didn't knew, not him. 

00:01:10
MIKE The other place it would come from is a feeling of superiority, like you're better than people around you. 

00:01:20
SUPERIORITY 

00:01:20
UNKNOWN The people who bully to let all aggression. 

00:01:20
UNKNOWN They want more confident in themselves. 

00:01:25
UNKNOWN I guess, she just wanted other people to feel some of the pain that she had. 

00:01:30
UNKNOWN But they who bully to like get attention, trying to be funny. 

00:01:30
UNKNOWN I would ask them why? Why they would bully something? Why do they do in the first place? Why they do for the crowd? I don't know, why they do it for people to get attention? I don't understand, why, just why? 

00:01:40
MIKE Underneath all of it, is our inability to walk in someone else's shoes. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN For those who you that bully, stop doing it 'cause a lot of people whose just get in hurt… already I lost one friend in the bullying. 

00:02:00
[music] 

00:02:05
UNKNOWN We got a new girl in our school. And umm… she was really nice, she fit in with us like perfectly. She started picking on one of umm… the girls in our like a little group. She was brutal. The first girl that she like targeted, she started like, like physically hurting her, making up things, just trying to get one of us at a time, out of the group. And we thought that she was gonna go for all three of us 'cause, she totally racked the first girl. 

00:02:40
MIKE When I was in 6th grade, I lived in Hawaii. My dad was in the Navy, so, we moved there for 2 years. And there was a kid that came up to me and asked me where my camera was. And every day he would call me a tourist and say "We don't want you here." It made me feel horrible and here I was in 6th grade trying to be a little tough guy and crying myself to sleep at night, because I didn't know how to respond it to him. 

00:03:05
UNKNOWN I've been bullied because of maybe because of my hair maybe, and sometimes, I've been bullied because of umm… like umm… my face because it has like things sometimes around it. And I'm bullied because the way I look, and because of like sometimes I wear like clothes like that was from like three weeks ago. 

00:03:35
YOU WOULD BE GONE AND I WOULD BE HAPPY. 

00:03:35
MIKE I got a message on Facebook the other day from a girl in Middle School. And she said, "Mike, yesterday after school a girl pushed me into the bus lane. This girl bullies me all the time." Now thankfully, there were no buses coming, but she said to me, "I wish there would have been a bus," because you would be gone and I would be happy. 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN Bullies expose people on the Facebook. When the victim goes on Facebook, they look at how many views they have. And they look at how many comments and the shares and the likes. They look at umm… the bully's page and they look at their statuses about, "Oh! This girl did this, this girl did that." 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN Like it falls on you 24/7. 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN An easier way to pick on the person. 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN Mainly just hypes everything up 'cause once you post in a social media then like, everybody can see, then everybody would know so. 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN You can use a different name to disguise yourself, so, you won't get in trouble for bullying them. 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN They get around so fast, so like people know fast lately, you get to expose people more, it makes it worse. 

00:04:35
[music] 

00:04:45
MIKE One thing you must realize that you are the target of bullying, is that it says so much more when they say these nasty things to you, it says so much more about, who they are rather than about who you are. 

00:05:00
HOW WE RESPOND 

00:05:00
SAD 

00:05:00
MIKE When we are the victims of bullying, there's two ways that we usually respond. The first way would be to retreat inside of ourselves, to go to a dark place, to get lonely, to get quiet, to keep it all that inside and say, "You know what, they're right, I am worthless, I am a loner, I am a loser, I don't have any friends, no one likes me." So you get sad. This could even lead to something very tragic which is called "Bullycide," where someone actually takes their own life because of this. This could just be text message after text message from a girl in your class that is just spitting venom at you. 

00:05:40
UNKNOWN You can feel sad because they can, they can make fun of you in a way, that you think you're normal. And then they'll make fun of you like saying "Oh! You're not normal" and they'll say a bunch of bad things about you that you think are good things about yourself. 

00:05:50
UNKNOWN You have a different pain every time it happens because when it happens at school or at your locker, it's… you feel some type of different way because one day you're feeling hurt, another you're feeling and then you… it adds on every single day. 

00:06:05
UNKNOWN You can be sad that the person is bullying you and that they'll make fun of you, or you'll be mad that they are doing it. 

00:06:10
VIOLENT 

00:06:10
ANGRY 

00:06:10
MIKE The second way would be to get violent, to get angry, to lash out, to make sure they get what's coming to them. We try to make them feel as horrible as they've made us feel. This could even lead to physical assault on the bully. 

00:06:30
UNKNOWN I started to be more like, like kind of rude. And, I had an attitude because, because the bullying changed me because I was getting bullied for the, the same things all over again and I would cry every time. But then that changed after 5th grade, the middle of the year, when I started to see when people were like getting attitude and giving me attitude and then they would, they were adding on from other people. 

00:06:50
UNKNOWN You can umm… get mad because you might wanna go after them and bully them. So, they can see how you feel when they were bullying you, but it's not the right thing to do. 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN When I was in 8th grade, I became a bully in one moment. I had been bullied so much in my life and I didn't know how to deal with it. And a kid during PE class grabs my shirt, while we were playing a game. I didn't like it. And I turned around and gave him the back side of my fist, and he hit the ground. I barely even knew this kid. He was looking at me, like I was a bully. I had become in that moment, what I hated. 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN Everyone needs attitude, everybody has attitude, but sometimes you need to see, you need to control it before it get… it gets too far, and then you're, you're in a situation where you're not supposed to be which is not necessary. 

00:07:45
UNKNOWN In my opinion, it's always better not really to get angry. Even if I go upset, it's a kind of just let it go down before you do something about it. Because, sometimes when you're upset like ou don't really do what you really would wanna do in the long run. 

00:08:05
MIKE There are four ways that you can actually act toward a bully that actually makes the bullying stop. I tried these and they worked for me when I was growing up, and I wanna share them with you. Now don't get me wrong, there are times when we need to go to a trusted adult or maybe an older friend, maybe an older sister, maybe an uncle, and say "This is what I'm going through." I need to talk to someone about this. Especially, when someone is threatening you with physical harm, you do not have to keep that in, or try to deal with it on your own. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN Tell you counsellor or parents. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN Tell the principals, the adults and teachers. 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN Knowing that somebody else, knows what's going on, so that way like it's also good to tell them when it starts. Because that way if it happens again, you can tell them without needing to explain what happened in the first place. 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN That person who keeps everything, your secrets between you and him or you and her. 

00:09:05
UNKNOWN They can help stop the bully. 

00:09:05
MIKE These four things will work for you. And I get message after message from students around the country that have tried this, and they go, "Mike, it works" and I go, "I know" 'cause it worked for me. 

00:09:20
4C'S PUT INTO PRACTICE 

00:09:20
"When people are rude and hurtful to me I stay confident and give them a compliment, which usually makes their jaw drop, while looking at them happily and give them a smile and walk away." 

00:09:30
"Driving in my car and a lady pulls up and starts cussing me out for cutting her off and I used the 4C's confidently, I gave her a compliment, while making eye contact, calmly telling her, 'I've got nothing but love for you baby!' Her window went up and she smiled and stopped being angry." 

00:09:45
"A friend of mine was getting bullied pretty bad on the school bus by a group of girls. After watching your 4C's video, we did what you said. It worked, Mike! The bullies haven't bothered us again!" 

00:09:55
"Your strategy gave me the courage to finally stand up to my bully." 

00:10:00
[music] 

00:10:05
4C'S 

00:10:05
REMAIN CALM 

00:10:10
MIKE The first C that you can use in responding to bullies, is to remain calm. Watch this, when someone comes at you, our tendency is to get crazy and get angry if they say, "Hey, loser, you're such a weirdo, no one likes you." And we go, "You know what, I'm gonna mess you up and we're gonna fight later and you…" And you know what, you end up getting in trouble and the teacher… gets you in trouble and you say "Well, they started it," and then you're sitting in the principal's office. 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN Every time you react, it's just giving them power, just to bully you. 

00:10:40
UNKNOWN If you would, were to react, they would get what they want, and they'd see you upset and that's the only reason why they do it. 

00:10:50
MIKE If you remain calm and they come at you and they say, "You punk, you weirdo, no one likes you." Or they say worse things than that which I know some of you hear worse things than that. And you respond in a way that's calm and you say, "You know, I don't really understand why you say these things to me, they don't make sense to me, I don't believe you, I know who I am and everyone else in my life says the opposite. They say, I'm a good guy, they say I'm a pretty cool girl. So, I'm just not going to listen to you anymore. Have a good day." 

00:11:30
UNKNOWN They want the person that they're bullying to respond, so they can get like momentum to keep bullying them. And like if the, if the person that has been bullied, is now seeing that the energy is going away, then the bully will be like… The bully would get tired of you, and then the bully would feel stupid. 

00:11:45
UNKNOWN It might be good for the person whose being bullied because they're not gonna uh… like slump to the bullies level. They just wanna be the good person and remain calm about it. 

00:11:55
UNKNOWN That'll make the bully feel umm… like he can't do nothing. 

00:12:00
UNKNOWN I think they would usually stop, 'cause they wouldn't be getting what they've want, what they want. 

00:12:05
UNKNOWN Just to walk away, 'cause doesn't have to do all violence in it, or anything. 

00:12:10
SAD 

00:12:10
MAD 

00:12:10
MIKE When you respond that way to a bully, they don't know how to process that, because they're so used to you getting sad or mad. And when you don't, and you respond and you're calm, the bullying will stop. I can almost guarantee it. 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN "Hey! The fat guy!" Like, "How are you today?" "Hmm… how are you today sir? Nice day, we're having uh?" The bully will probably just side them off. 

00:12:40
[music] 

00:12:50
GET CONNECTED 

00:12:50
MIKE The next C would be to get connected and stay connected to other people. You know what bullies look for, you know, what their target? Loners. People that are by themselves. 

00:13:00
UNKNOWN They might do that because they don't have any friends that can help them. 

00:13:05
UNKNOWN They don't have enough people to back them up. They don't have like, a lot of people who can do anything. So their chances of getting in trouble would be smaller. 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN Let's say that bully doesn't have that many friends, and they find somebody who's just like them. And they feel like, if they bully them, then they'll have more power and they seem better than that person. 

00:13:25
MIKE Find other people and connect yourself to them. I know it's hard. 

00:13:30
UNKNOWN Get up and talk to the people 'cause they think they're weird, in like tone, I'm not weird. I'm like, "You can't judge a book by its cover, unless, you get to know them. " 

00:13:40
UNKNOWN There was this one time, when people were bullying this kid in my school. I'm not gonna say, no names, but I stood upfront and then they stop bullying him for, for the rest of his, for the rest of their life and it felt good to me. 

00:14:00
UNKNOWN Uh… a friend stand up for another friend, it's like no friend left behind. 

00:14:10
MIKE Now, I get message after message on Facebook, email, wherever from students around the country they say, "Mike, I have a hard time making friends what can I do?" And here's my biggest most important piece of advice for you. If you want to be more connected, is make the first step. Most of us sit around waiting for the friends to come to us. "I'm never invited to the parties, I'm never invited to the beach, people don't wanna sit with me at lunch, I'm not asked to be in the group project, I'm not…" Listen, just stop and start being the connector. 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN They could try and do stuff like group activities, like after school sports and stuff, to get to know friends, or like find out something that you have in common with other kids. 

00:14:55
UNKNOWN You can join things, you can like to sports, you can go to your teacher and see if anybody they think will be close to what you are. 

00:15:05
UNKNOWN Sometimes you kind of try and find the people who are looking for friends too. 

00:15:10
MIKE Anyone you walk by, "Hey! What's up? Hey! What's up?" and then when you're sitting there waiting for the bus, don't put your headphones in, keep your headphones out or just keep one in and talk to the person next to you. "Hey! I noticed you're in my science class. Man, that class is hard right?" "Uh… no, I think it's pretty…" "You think it's easy? Maybe I should study with you, you probably really good at it." See you just made the first step and now you're connected to someone. And now you're sitting with someone on the bus instead of sitting by yourself and having the bullies throw things at you. 

00:15:40
UNKNOWN Try to find someone who's like you, there could be a bunch of other people who are just like you, who have trouble making friends. Look for them, those kind of people 'cause I remember, I got a really great friend by doing that. 

00:15:55
BE CONFIDENT 

00:15:55
MIKE Make the first step and stay connected. The third C, be confident. 

00:16:05
UNKNOWN When they go to school, the first thing that's on their minds is "What are they gonna do today? What are they gonna do to me? What's gonna happen today? Am I gonna run from school?" "Am I gonna go to the bathroom, and they're gonna bully me there…" or they're gonna put my name on the wall and say "You're stupid." Or you… are they gonna do even more, are they gonna do less? Is it ever gonna stop?" 

00:16:25
MIKE When I moved between 10th and 11th grade across America, I went from San Diego to Northern Virginia. I went from a very tiny school to a very huge school. And I went from getting bullied to not getting bullied so much anymore, by the time I was a junior. But here's what changed I said to myself, "I'm sick of it, I'm sick of people wiping their feet on me. I'm sick of being a doormat and I don't want this life anymore. I want a better life. I want the life I deserve." And I decided to be confident and I said, "I'm not gonna let it affect me anymore." And even if I have to pretend like it doesn't affect me and pretend like I'm confident. For a while, until I become confident, I've got to do something. And it worked. 

00:17:15
UNKNOWN At our school team, in girls group one of us was in the classroom, we had to look in the mirror for like a long time to see like you're nose and all that, because when you look in the mirror you have to see like, you have to look at yourself and then you go self-esteem. 

00:17:30
UNKNOWN You could think in good thoughts about yourself instead of thinking things like "Oh, I'm too short, I'm too tall." You could think good things about yourself like "I'm really good at that, I'm really at this, I'm really proud of myself," in that way. 

00:17:40
UNKNOWN You try to find people who kind of know who they are, and are confident within who they are and try to see what they do and try to be like them. 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN Because they end for themselves, would not like in the way that they're like, like egging it on, or like stand up for something like say, leave me alone or some like that. 

00:17:55
MIKE Now, when you act that way toward someone who's bullying you, just watch the bullying disappear, just watch it. It's not magic, it's not over night, but watch, it will affect them. Because you're saying to them "I am more confident than you. I'm staying calm, I'm connected and I'm confident." 

00:18:20
UNKNOWN You're just gotta stand up one day and you're gonna tell the truth. And you're not gonna front or anything, you're just gonna tell the truth. And then watch when they'll be quite. Then, watch when they'll be speechless then they, they won't, they won't do that again. 

00:18:35
COMPLIMENT THE BULLY 

00:18:35
MIKE The fourth and final C, complement the bully. This one might be the hardest one to do, because when someone is saying nasty things to you, when someone is treating you with disrespect. Ping them a compliment is almost impossible. But you would be amazed at how well it works to get the bully to stop. So for example, someone's saying "Oh! You're such a loser, you're such a weirdo, no one likes you, you're not coming to the party because you smell." And you go "Hey! I like that sweater buddy," and you walk away. 

00:19:10
UNKNOWN I think like if you give a bully a compliment in the middle of… he feels like, I don't want to say like roasting momo(ph), he'll be like, he'll be like a pause, like a surprise, a surprise of moment comes in like… 

00:19:25
UNKNOWN Maybe the bully would just leave you alone after that, because they know that they can't target you anymore 'cause you've overpowered them. 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN It would either confuse, it frustrate them 'cause you're giving them the opposite of what they want, kind of like, kind of like for a psychology. 

00:19:45
MIKE It's almost funny, how it diffuses the bully. They don't know what to do with it. 

00:19:50
[music] 

00:19:55
CLAM 

00:19:55
CONNECTED 

00:19:55
CONFIDENT 

00:19:55
COMPLIMENT 

00:19:55
MIKE So here's a quick recap of the 4C's that I shared with you. Stay calm, get connected, be confident and complement the bully. Bullying is never a good option. Remember, imagine what it's like to walk in their shoes. And if you're the victim of bullying, you are never deserving of that. Whether you're the bully or the bullied, you were a big deal. You matter, you have work, you have value, aside from the way you're treated, aside from what people say you are. 

00:20:35
UNKNOWN Don't be a bully, always help. 

00:20:35
UNKNOWN Just try to forget everything I said because most of it probably isn't even true. 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN I think you should get a lot of friends, so they could have you're back. 

00:20:45
UNKNOWN You need to have people that will like stand up for you. 

00:20:45
UNKNOWN Just because your life went bad, doesn't mean you should make other people's… 

00:20:50
UNKNOWN Do what you, now that you hope somebody would have done to you. 

00:20:50
MIKE You're worth it.
