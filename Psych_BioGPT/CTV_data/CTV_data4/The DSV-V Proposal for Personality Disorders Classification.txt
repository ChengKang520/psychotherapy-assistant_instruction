 Welcome. This is the point counterpoint with, ah, Otto Kernberg and David Barlow. Ah, Dr. Kernberg is gonna be speaking for an hour and, ah, Dr. Barlow then will have 15 minutes for counterpoint and then we'll have 15 minutes for, uhm, some questions, answers that you may have. Ah, I've been asked to be very brief in the introductions and that makes a lot of sense given that it takes me about an hour and a half to clear my throat. Anyway, ah, and with these two heavy hitters I could spend the entire day just listening, listing the contributions that they've given. Uhm, Dr. Kernberg, director of personality disorders, ah, institute, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, professor of psychiatry of Weill-- Medical College of Cornell University.

Latest book, The Inseparable Nature of Love and Aggression. A words less-- his integrating post-war ego psychology and his integrate of writing central to the development of modern optic relations. A theory of mind, the contributions this man has made to our field as reverberations through areas even beyond the psychoanalytic area. Dr. Barlow, professor of psychology, psychiatry founder and director of Emeritus the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders at Boston University.

DR. OTTO KERNBERG I think I can talk from here. I, I have difficulty seeing you because of the light but at least I think because of the light you must be seeing me. I'll actually, it, it minor correction I'm grateful for the introduction but I'll talk for half an hour not one hour and, ah, that should give more time for discussion and then usually interchange. And I will read, uhm, ah, pa-- paper that is an overall critique of the personality section of DSM-V. Overview and critic of the classification of personality disorders proposed by DSM-V. The committee developing the new classification of personality disorders for the forthcoming DSM-V started from several assumptions. First, that the DSM-IV classification had proved unsatisfactory because of the high co-morbidity found regarding the various personality disorders, and the fact that the most frequent diagnostic conclusion in clinical practice, was quote, "personality disorder NOS," that is, not otherw-- not othewise specified. Second, within the committee, their continued and old dynamic tension between empirical researchers, interested in developing classification systems for the personality characteristics and for the personality characteristics of normal populations, on the one hand, and clinicians who were concerned about developing a classification system that would do justice to the personality disorder constellations found in clinical settings. Numerous factor analysis studies of large samples had demonstrated the consistent findings of the five factor system in describing the major dimensions that determine the differential profile of personality structures within a normal population. These five dimensions were openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Clinical psychiatry and psychology, in contrast, have consistently found certain predominant constellations of pathological personality traits that translated into differential categories of personality disorders, while mixed features of several of them might combine in certain patients. These clinical categories, it has been found that differential prognostic and therapeutic implications. In short, competing dimensional and categorical systems of classification constituted a significant dynamic within the committee the, the, the committees involved in DSM-III, IV, and V. DSM-IV was a purely categorical system and the 10 categories of personality disorders it described, represented, well-differentiated entities, each of them characterized by a certain number of traits, which, in turn, signified that any particular diagnosis might be achieved by a particular combination of such respective traits. The underlying heterogeneity of the-- of at least some of these disorders was illustrated by the fact that different combinations of the traits representing one category could determine the same diagnostic conclusion about the presence. The personality disorders work group of DSM-V operated under strong instructions from the overall leadership of the DSM-V to shift from the categorical system of DSM-IV into a dimensional system. In addition to the dissatisfaction with the DSM-IV categorical classification system, other fundamental considerations also played a role here. First, the search for a new classification system should link concrete behavioral traits with assumed underlying neurobiological dispositions and functions, and with the possibility of developing neurobiological and genetic markers to determine the disposition to a specific personality disorder. In this regard, this effort corresponded to a major emphasis on translational research, relating psychopathology to neurobiological functioning and to pathology in the neurobiological realm. Second, less explicit, but as an underlying ideological influence, this orientation reflected a long ongoing struggle between neurobiological and psychodynamic disciplines, and the growing strength of neurobiological psychiatry in reducing the influence of clinical psychodynamic concepts and findings on the personality disorder classification system, bringing it into line with the dramatic growth and knowledge about the genetic and neurobiological basis of major domains of clinical psychiatry. A major compromised solution. The dynamic tension between the researchers interested in the empirical studies of normal populations, relating them to the predominant prototypes of personality disorders, and clinical psychiatrist trying to preserve what they saw as their confirmed experience of the validity of major categories described in DSM-IV evolved in the direction of a compromise, that included an important, major new development. Namely, the agreement on a common basic factor of all personality disorders, a factor that represented a major criterion for the assessment of the severity of any personality disorder. The integration or lack of integration of the self, that is, of normal identity, and the degree of normality or pathology in the relation of the individual with others. Here, what might be called the common sense observation that patients with personality disorders have difficulty in their comprehension and management of themselves and with their comprehension and management of the relationship with significant others was recognized, for the first time, as a basic characteristic of personality disorders. The fact that this dimension could be explis-- ex-- explicated, operationalised, and clinically evaluated in terms of the degree of its disturbance, satisfied both empirical dimensionalists, and particularly, psychodynamic psychotherapists, who, for over 30 years, have observed, described, and utilized this dimension in their assessment and therapeutic approaches to personality disordered patients. Regarding the differentiation of major personality prototypes, the struggle between the clinical experience of those interested in maintaining the categories of the DSM-IV system, and the researchers who wished to relate the five factor model to clinical prototypes of pathological personality structures led to a compromise. Of the 10 DSM-IV personality prototypes, those would be retained that could evince significant, empirical research carried out in recent years in support of their maintenance, and also were clinically important from the viewpoint of their frequency in clinical practice. 

00:11:45
DR. OTTO KERNBERG This led first to maintaining the schizotypal, antisocial, borderline, avoidant and obsessive-compulsive personality disorders five of the original 10 categories. This decision, which in itself, already involved significant tensions and disagreements within the committee, evolved a mi-- toward a minor temporal crisis of a sort, because of the proposed elimination of the narcissistic personality disorder, for which there is a abundant recent empirical studies and that is of high prevalence in clinical practice, and yet, was slated to be excluded. In all fairness, it may be said that this attempted exclusion manifested the anti-psychodynamic pious prevalent in the work group, because the clinical description, the study of the psychopathology, and empirical research on the features of this disorders that been carried out mostly by psycho-dynamically oriented researchers and clinicians. In fact, the narcissistic personality disorder was reinstated, and became a sixth category within the proposed DSM-V nomenclature. The excluded categories. The work group decided that the excluded DSM-IV personality disorders, the paranoid, schizoid, histrionic, and dependent personality disorders, and the personality disorders from the appendix of DSM-IV that is, the depressive and the negativistic personality disorder, as well as the category of personality disorder NOS, would now be subsumed under the diagnosis of a quote, "trait-specified personality disorder," close quote, in practice meaning that the clinician would have the option of diagnosing a personality disorder on the basis of the pathology of self and relationships with others, and tailoring the description of the personality disorder to fit the specific patient, by using the specific features included by the corresponding pathological traits. Needless to say, serious questions may be raised by the exclusion of personality disorders that have a long history of significant clinical observations and specific therapeutic interventions, such as, for example, the paranoid personality disorder and the histrionic personality disorder, the latter one corresponding to the broad spectrum of pathology described in psychodynamic literature, ranging from the hysterical to the histrionic or infantile personality disorders, and the depressive personality disorder, that has a prognostically favorable implication for psychodynamic psychotherapies. Also, the fact that no major research has been carried out, in recent years, regarding the paranoid personality disorder, seems a problematic reason for eliminating it. In any case, from the viewpoint of the psycho-dynamically oriented proponents of a categorical nomenclature, the reinstatement of the narcissistic personality disorder represented a significant positive development, corresponding to clinical reality. Clinicians may feel that the histrionic personality disorder may still be considered a less severe form of the borderline personality disorder, and the schizoid personality disorder unless severe form of the schizotypal one, and refer to them, in their practice, in that context. For the neurobiologically oriented, and dimensional trait system committed members of the work group, the influence of the five factor theory seems to be relatively assured by the relationship of the factors of conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism, respectively, to the obsessive-compulsive personality, the avoidant personality reflecting detachment, as the polar opposite of extraversion, the antisocial personality as an expression of antagonism, the polar opposite of agreeableness, and the borderline personality disorder as the expression of neuroticism, in the sense of negative affectivity, reflecting emotional dysregulation and lability. In so far, as conscientiousness is considered the polar opposite of dis-inhibition, reflected by impulsivity, it would indicate another relationship between personality disorders and the five-factor model. It needs to be pointed out that the factor of openness, reflecting, in fact, openness to unusual, idiosyncratic, bizarre ideas that would seem related to the schizotypal personality disorder, raise sufficient methodological and conceptual questions to be discarded. A new factor, "psychoticism" underquote, was considered as representing the factorial personality dimension reflected in the schizotypal personality disorders. In short, with the exception of the narcissistic personality disorder, either by their direct representation in the clinical picture or by means of their expression by their polar opposite, the five-factor model thus could be related to basic domains of personality underlying the personality disorders included in DSM-V. The overall proposed model. In summary, the proposed DSM-V personality disorder model includes two fundamental assessment. One, the general level of personality functioning scale, including the assessment of self and of interpersonal functioning, and two, the diagnostic criteria for the six selected specific categories of personality disorders. The assessment of the degrees of pathologies of the experience of self includes the following components. A, identity, the experience of oneself as unique, with clear boundaries between self and others, self-esteem and accuracy of self-appraisal, capacity for, and ability to regulate the range of emotional experience. B, self direction, the pursuit of coherent and meaningful short-term and long-term life goals, utilization of constructive and pro-social internal standards of behavior, ability to self-reflect productively. The assessment of interpersonal functioning included, a, empathy, comprehension and application of others experiences and motivations, tolerance of different perspectives, understanding of the effect of ones own behavior on others, and b, intimacy, depth and duration of positive connection with others, desire and capacity for closeness, mutuality of regard reflected in interpersonal behavior. In short, the components proposed to be central to a personality functioning con-- functioning continuum are identity, self-direction, empathy, and intimacy, and the corresponding scale differentiates five levels of impairment, going from non-impairment, healthy functioning, to extreme impairment. The diagnostic criteria for the six specific personality disorder types, antisocial, avoidance, borderline, narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, and schizotypal is defined by the level of personality functioning reflected by the self, the A criteria and by the corresponding specific pathological personality traits the B criteria. In addition, all discarded categories, those in the appendix of DSM-IV, and personality disorder NOS will now be classified as personality disorders with specific predominance of certain constellations of traits, and the personality disorder NOS, no longer will be required. In addition it was decided to eliminate the general, ah, damnation of, uhm, uhm, access to so that personality disorders will be treated like all other personality disorder. It's a minor and symbolic change. Some critical reflections. From the viewpoint of this commentary, the major innovative contribution and strength of the DSM-V proposal resides in the belated recognition of the essential nature of the experience of the self and of relationships with significant others in the assessment of normality or degree of pathology of the personality. The concept of an integrated self, in contrast to severe lack of integration that characterizes what, in psychoanalytic literature, Erik Erickson introduced many years back as the concept of identity diffusion, is the central issue in the evaluation of a personality disorder, a fundamental structure of the personality, the pathology of which defines, more than anything else, the nature and degree in severity of personality disorders. The criteria of identity and self-direction now proposed reflect that aspect of the self accurately. The relationship with others, as DSM-V has recognized, intimately relates to the degree of integration of the self, and reflects, I would add, the integration of the representation of significant others that are reflected in the actual capability of empathy and intimacy as now defined in the DSM-V model. It is remarkable that the essential characteristics of personality disorders are described in terms of predominantly subjective experiences, a very important aspect in the evaluation of the personality, which complements the analysis of the actual interpersonal and social functioning. The research on attachment has provided the objective evidence for the intimate connection between the earliest relation with significant others, the build-up of internal models of those relationships as reciprocal, dyadic constellations of self and object representations, and psychoanalytic theory has provided an explanatory theory of how these early intrapsychic structures become integrated, respectively, into an integrated concept of self and of significant others. The maintenance of the six major diagnostic categories of personality disorders, be it within an effort to link them to a predominantly trait-oriented psychology with the expectation of direct, linear relationships to neurobiological functioning and to underlying genetic predispositions, does, indeed, reflect clinically predominant categories of personality disorders, and, these categories are justified, it seems to this commentator, to have been retained. The elimination of the other four categories from DSM-IV however, raises questions. The fact that there has not been empirical research in recent years regarding these other personality types does not seem to be reason enough to eliminate them if they are clinically relevant, and, again, reconfirmed in clinical practice, and, therefore, important in the general differential diagnosis and therapeutic approach to personality disorders. The paranoid personality disorder, for example, would be easily recognized by most clinicians, and has been described in the psychiatric literature of many countries. But even if their agnostic utilization in clinical practice is less frequent than the personality disorders that have been retained, the wisdom of including only the most frequent conditions, while discarding less frequent yet clinically dis-- discriminant conditions is questionable. Would we exclude relatively rare types of illness in other medical fields just because of few cases where the diagnosis has been established? Another issue with regard to the excluded personality disorders is that some represent milder forms of underlying pathologies, the elimination of which does not quite do justice to the spectrum of certain related personality disorders. Thus, as mentioned before, the histrionic personality may represent a less severe form of the borderline personality disorder, but, by the same token, presents a different prognosis and indication for therapeutic management. The same may be stated regarding the schizoid personality disorder, reasonably considered a less severe form of the schizotypal personality disorder, with important implications regarding gene-- genetic predisposition to schizophrenia in the latter, but less likely saw in the former. Here, we touch upon an area not explored by the DSM-IV nor by the DSM-V committee, the dimensional aspect of relationships between groups of personality disorders, such as, the schizoid and schizotypal, the histrionic and borderline, and the unacknowledged relationship between the narcissistic personality disorder and the antisocial personality disorder, the latter and extremely severe form of pathological narcissism that presents the symptoms of a narcissistic personality as an important aspect of its features. What I am suggesting here is that there exists a dimensional aspect of relationships between various personality disorders that by itself, justifies, it seems to me, a classification of personality disorders that combines categorical and dimensional features. From this very general viewpoint, the adoption of DSM-V, of such a combined, quote, "hybrid," close quote model seems appropriate. The effort to link the five factor model as representative of descriptive studies of large normal populations with the prototypes of clinically observed personality disorders may be questioned from the standpoint of the particular structure of an individual personality disorder, regardless of their neurobiological or psychosocial dispositions, the nature of personality disorders may reflect an organization of constellations of personality traits that may not have-- that may not have any psycho-pathological relevance regarding the statistically predominant constellations of traits of normal populations the five factor system. The assumed relationship between the five factor system and the nature of the remain-- of the retained personality disorders seems rather forced, with the factor of openness not relevant at all, and the need to establish a new factor, psychoticism to find a possible connection with the schizotypal personality disorder seemingly well illustrating this point. The double layer of neurobiological and subjective, intrapsychic structures. The most important critique, in my view, of the conceptual underpinning of the proposed DSM-V personality disorders model relates to the underlying assumption that a trait psychology, in contrast to a categorical one, may permit a direct relationship between concrete personality traits and underlying neurobiological mechanism. There are, of course, underlying neurobiological mechanism related to all psychological functioning, subjectivity and intentionality, as we know by now, are clearly dependent on complex structural arrangement of the central nervous system, and there are concrete linkages between the functioning on different areas of the brain and subjective and behavioral aspects of human psychology. The function of neurotransmitters, such as oxytocin, in activating the attachment system and being influential in the passionate aspects of erotic life illustrates one such relationship, that the orientation of the self-regarding of the relationship of the relationship that the orientation of the self regarding its immediate psychological environment and its influent on affect control relate to function of the medial prefrontal cortex and the anterior part of the cingulum has been clearly established. In our own research on borderline personality disorder, we have found that the hyperactivity of the amygdala, combined with a primary inhibition of the prefrontal and pre-orbital cortex differentiates these patients from normal controls, and there's an abundant literature in this regard, that has confirmed these findings, in recent years. But we have also learned that the central nervous system operates not through the ital-- isolated activation of particular structures on neurotransmitters but, rather, through the integrated activation of multiple structures. For example, emotional dysregulation depends on a complex interaction between the activation of limbic areas, the hippocampus and amygdala, cortical areas, particularly the prefrontal and pre-orbital cortex and the anterior cingula region, and even broader areas including insular and aspects of the parietal, temporal and occipital cortices. By the same token, we also have evidence that certain key psychological functions, in turn, derive from the organization of underlying psychological structures, such as the very concept of the self, derived from the integration of centers of self-reflection that provide information about the location of the body in space and time, the information from the linguistic self, the status of the historical self, the assessment of the perception of self by others. In other words, while all these psychological functions derive from a neurobiological basis, they, in turn, become organized at a psychological level. The study of subjective intentionality of behavior, I believe, has to consider two levels of organismic organization, a basic neurobiological one, and a derived, secondary, symbolic or psychological one that, as recent research also has shown, in turn may influence the functioning of the underlying neurobiological structures. This conceptualization of the double layer of neuropsychological organization raises serious questions about the organization of our nomenclature of personality disorders in terms of the linear concept of interaction between isolated multiple traits, practically considered as almost equivalent in the individuality. This problem, it seems to me, is clearly reflected in the context with in, in the context in with-- in which the main dimension rightly proposed for personality disorders, namely the integration of the self, reflected by identity and self-direction on the one hand, and the capacity and intimacy on the other. In conclusion, my view is that the proposed DSM-V model for classification of personality disorders represents a significant improvement over DSM-IV, by adding, as central criteria, the severity of pathology of the self and of relations with others, incorporating, in this regard, the findings and clinical contributions from psychoanalytic object relations theory. The decision to maintain six of the 10 categories of DSM-IV is wise, and will permit continuity in the research regarding those respective areas. There e-- the elimination of the four categories that have been excluded seems to me questionable, but perhaps may be compensated in practice by signaling the constellation of the corresponding, predominant traits in those personality disorders that also fulfill criterion A, that is regarding identity, but cannot be classified within the six categories that remain. The main problem with the new classification lies not, it seems to me, in the decisions regarding its shape, to the point at which is-- it has been agreed upon until now, but in the untouched conceptual and methodological problem of dealing with the disposition to personality disorders stemming from two interrelated levels of organization of the mind, a basic neurobiological one, and the symbolic or psychological level. The achievement of such an integration implies tasks for future research. Thank you for your attention.

DR. DAVID BARLOW Thank you very much, Dr. Kernberg for those, ah, what I find very interesting remarks. First I'd like to say that, ah, I first met, ah, had the pleasure meeting Dr. Kernberg almost 40 years ago, I think now. Uhm, and, uhm, he has been over the decades, you know, a continued intellectual force in the, ah, conceptualizing the, uhm, the personality disorders, how we approach them, how, ah, treat them and has remained active all these decades and been very productive and contributory. And I can say personally has been a gentlemen all the way. So, uhm, it's really, ah, an honor and a, and a privilege to be able to, ah, discuss some of, ah, his work even if he may not be totally thrilled with everything I have to say. Ah, but that's the point of this account, ah, point counterpoint of kind of, ah, issues. And I'm not sure we differ all that much. But just by a way of a background all of you are here I'm sure because you have, ah, an interest in, in personality disorders perhaps psychodynamic formulations of the same. Uhm, you wouldn't think, I mean you just step back and reflect on it. Personality disorder is not the area that I've spent most of my, ah, career studying but obviously, uhm, I've had very much been in, interested in, in the progress. But why? When you look at how we conceptualized these issues over the years. You think will be a little further along? No, it just seems to me than we are. You think will be-- let's say much closer to a consensus on how personality is organized and where it can go wrong and, and how it can be classifies. I mean, if you go back to just the, uhm, you know, cen-- ah, almost a century ago to some of the Jungian. Ah, basic concepts of introversion and extraversion, you know, which we can all still relate to in some degree. You think over the decades you know, we would have been able to articulate these concepts, these constructs along with the related kind of what we can-- what we think to be, ah, relatively stable and enduring facets of a, ah, functioning as a, as a we consider personality disorders to be. Ah, you know, and, and again a more a coherent way. And yet, we obviously have it as a, as evident from, ah, Dr. Kernberg comments today. I had the interesting, ah, experience of sitting on a DSM-IV task force which finished his work almost 20 years ago. Ah, in the early '90s. And, at that time. You know, Dr. Kernberg has, ah, spoken about the mandate from DSM-V task force to come up with a more dimensional approach. Well, the same thing happen in DSM-IV. I mean at the level of the task force everybody was pointing to, ah, more dimensional approach. Ah, recognizing that it would be difficult across the what-- within call the access one disorders. But that certainly it would be-- it should be possible in the-- what we call any access to disorders. Uhm, and we were truly surprised, we were urging on personal-- personality disorder work group. And we were truly surprised when the major proponents working together in this group simply could not agree on what the dimensions would be. Ah, even though most of them would agree that it would be desirable to have dimensions. I couldn't agree in what they could be. And here we are 20 years later, with, uhm, and again my, my colleagues in this area would, would, ah, we could debate this. But the basic factors, we still can agree on what the, ah, principled dimensions would be if we were to move to a more dimensional of framework to consider personality. So the fall back position, uhm, some would say there far-- what we heard today was the perhaps the, uhm, correct position but others would call it the fall back position is to, ah, continue on with our categorical, ah, ah, kinds of a conceptions of personality disorders. Despite the very difficult issues with reliability in many of the areas not, not all such as any social. But, ah, many of the areas and the other, uhm, you know, very widely recognized, ah, you know, difficulties that are presented by the, ah, that, that the current categorical although the, the existing, ah, categorical mechanisms. Ah, Dr. Kernberg mentioned some interesting possibilities that have been around for awhile for clustering the disorders along, ah, dimensions. Ah, when I studied personality disorders, you know, we, we, we all had kind of the A, B and C clusters that was I think, ah, pretty much what was, ah, being referred to, other names with them. Ah, but, uhm, and this seem to reflect the certain relationship and you know, perhaps some progress could have been made there. But it doesn't seem to have gone any where in, in DSM-V I don't even see it, ah, really, ah, ah, given highlighted through any great degree. So, we always have had this, ah, tension and not just in personality disorders but throughout the classification does the, the whole science have classifying a psychopathology and human behavior generally. We've had this, uhm, tension as I was alluding to yesterday briefly between what's called the splitters on the one hand and the lumpers on the other. And that categorizes the, the whole of, you know, the study of psychopathology. And the splitters as you know, are the people looking forevermore, ah, well-defined but thinly sliced, ah, aspects of psychopathology that can be studied very effectively, uhm, but only represent you know, saying of one hand, hand on your proverbial elephant. And the lumpers on the other hand say, "Why can't we look at what all this disorders have in common?" You know, and, and the, ah, maybe array them along some kinds of dimensions. Well, we all thought that the, uhm, the lumpers those favor in dimensions would clearly when the day with DSM-V but obviously as you know that has simply not been the case. Ah, some people have pointed out is that we, we have, ah, ah, among some categories of disorders such as anxiety disorders that I study. We have more disorders than ever. Ah, we have 10 new disorders in what were the DSM-IV anxiety disorders has been 10 disorders added to it. Now, some of them created a novel, some of them transferred in from other areas, ah, the anxiety-- disorders themselves had been split into three major categories now. You know, obsessive-compulsive, trauma and stress or disorders and the, the classical anxiety disorders. So, there's not much to, ah, cheer up the lumpers among any of you or among, ah, any of them, ah, ah, who are studying these-- ah, this a phenomenon. But on the other hand there are some interesting, ah, developments. Dr. Kernberg mention that access two has been dropped. And he referred to it as a minor cosmetic, ah, I believe in if your words a minor cosmetic, ah, kind of change just so the anxie-- the personality disorders would be then considered in the same kind of ways other disorders. Uhm, I would beg the differ a bit on that one. I don't think it's a minor, ah, cosmetic change. If in fact, ah, personality disorders no longer meet an over action criteria of, ah, but differentiates them from what we use to call the rest of access one disorders. Then how do they differ? I mean what are their characteristics? Uhm, to return to anxiety disorders for example. Uhm, personality disorders we've all learned relatively enduring, stable, ah, ah, ways characterizing, ah, organization of personality and particularly your interaction wi-- interaction with the others. And how you, ah, interact. But look at anxiety disorders now. Uhm, now we have, ah, a clear kind of focus of, ah, transition in considering the anxiety disorders. Looking at what is common among them. And what are we looking at? Of course we're looking at a temperament of personality trait which is one of the major, ah, traits characterizing any, ah, conception of personality whether it's a big three, the big five to what whatever that is neuroticism. Ah, Dr. Kernberg maybe surprised to hear me become and very interested in neuroticism but in fact, uhm, the evidence seems very fairly clear to a number of us based on, ah, empirical, you know factor analytic, ah, structural equation, modeling work that this trait accounts for much of the covariance among all of the existing anxiety and mood disorders. Ah, you know, bipolar mood disorders and extends out to the what we call the old neurotic spectrum and, ah, what we now call somatic symptom disorders, associative disorders, ah, ah, and the like. And they all do seem to share a comment, ah, uhm, underlying dimension or higher-order dimension if you like of neuroticism and rather than considering you know, splitting all the disorders into smaller and smaller, ah, ah, entities. The in, the, ah, sort of a trend now is to look at what is common among all of these disorders and begin to direct our treatments more specifically to the temperament of neuroticism which we are finding by the way is much more malleable than we had imagined in the past. Well, and one of the other personality disorders by the way that would fit very neatly, ah, into this grouping as actually was indicated in Dr. Kernberg's paper would be borderline personality disorder with some people think of it as the queen of emotional disorders. And indeed it's, ah, has all the characteristics of other emotional disorders in terms of intense frequent negative effect, ah, difficulty regulating that affectedly into kind of maladaptive strategy, to do so, ah, etcetera. But in the extreme to the 10th degree. Uhm, it's noted that, ah, by our leading behavior geneticist that, uhm, in, in terms of, ah, you know, looking at, at some of the potential, ah, let me-- let me say back-- a couple of minute and say that, you know, there, there are several groups that are-- that are interested in more categorical kinds of approaches in maintaining or even increasing them. And one of them, ah, interestingly enough are some of the, ah, ah, neuroscientist who in some cases split among themselves on this. So, there are some neuroscientist who say all of this-- so it-- you can't possibly consider, uhm, what's common about OCD in depression and panic disorder because of such different brain functions, ah, you know, when you do the imaging you get a little-- you get a little bit, ah, kind of a different brain function. Others on the other hand point out as was pointed out than the paper you heard this morning that all of these disorders share overarching common, ah, kind of a brain function activity and that is you know, hyperactivity in the amygdala and there are reduced or inhibited kind of cortical control over, ah, what we call colloquially the emotional brain. Ah, all of disorders have that. Furthermore from a, a genetic point of view, uhm, you know, every week in the papers I mentioned yesterday. You hear, ah, you know, we've discovered the gene, the pathological gene for this disorder or that disorder. Only to find it's never, you know, replicated and, ah, and our leading behavioral geneticist, people who study this, ah, for a li-- a living like then, you know, Ken Kendler and others say that, thi-- this will never happen, will never be able to cut nature at the joints which is what the classification of people like to say. Ah, by, ah, studying genetics and that in fact the genetic basis and contribution to anxiety in related disorders is really just rescinds normal kind of a related variations in the existing, ah, patterns of, of a genes and that's pretty much as far as will get. And furthermore, considering the kind of a dynamic, ah, gene environment interactions and the environment obviously plays a major role in turning on these genes that may-- you may go through life being a closet neurotic and never really know it because it didn't have the kind of environmental circumstances that stress you to the extent that some of these traits will come out. So you know, how is that, ah, classify? Uhm, so-- and if we really began considering anxiety disorders in this way. If we really begin considering anxiety disorders as a major temperament with some contributions also from say low positive affect which contributes to many the anxiety and mood disorders. But if we look at the temperamental structure of these emotional disorders and we consider them as we know these disorder are is relatively enduring, ah, kinds of conditions that do wax wane over time but, uhm, and are amenable to treatment but often you know, even in our most successful cases, you know, the, the remnants of this, this kind of a, you know, emotional hyperactivity, neurotic traits if you like are still there. Then is that a personality disorder? And how should we conceptualized vis-à-vis the traditionally, ah, ah, defined personality disorders. Are-- is the whole, ah, realm of psychopathology basically personality disorders and that they are made up of traits that, ah, express themselves in various, ah, idiosyncratic way among individuals and we've been focusing on that. Let me ha-- its actually, you know, something to consider. When you look at your traditional personality disorders you look at avoidant, you look at obsessive-compulsive, uhm, again as I already mentioned you look at borderline, ah, many people have been saying for years that those are really on a continuum with the existing anxiety disorders. You know, the anxiety disorders start young, ah, you know, it's probably reflecting the neurotic temperament and then flower out into various things depend on some in idiosyncratic learning. So, you know, how are we to best conceptualized these things going forward? Now we have another 20 years and I presumed I'm not sure either one of us will be around, ah, for DSM-VI. But, ah, you know, how is this going to go forward? What's going to be the real progress? Can we stand back and re-conceptualized all of psychopathology to look at the temperaments and traits that, ah, that are run, run through it? Uhm, are they truly on dimensions as our long suffering, ah, colleagues who study this personality temperaments but can seem to come to an agreement on them? You know, are they truly all just on, on dimensions where it's very difficult to make a cut point or others some qualitative difference either, ah, ah, neurobiologically or psycho-pathologically, you know, that will allow us other than temperament obviously that's the one we use now in DSM just temperament. You know, how impaired are you? Uhm, so, ah, so these are all questions that, uhm, I think are fascinating but, ah, kind of confounding at the same time. But it seems to me maybe as time to step back and take a broader look at psychopathology. At the end it play in contribution about biological, psychological environmental factors. And maybe look to see if we can't come up with a more comprehensive overall assessment it might yield more consensus. So, those are just my thoughts on, on this, ah, ah, morning and I think we have plenty of time to get all of your thoughts.

00:54:45
 If you have any questions please come up to the microphones, ah, rather than yelling them out, ah, in that way we can have them recorded also. So if there any questions, comments. Yes, sir. 

00:55:00
 My clinical experience with individuals that present with, ah, anxious features. I've noted that there is a subset of those that have, ah, long standing, ah, the symptoms without resolution despite medication and, ah, psychotherapy including, ah, uhm, you know, some of the, ah, empirically supported a behavioral a-- at interventions. The psychodynamic, ah, diagnostic manual list an anxious personality disorder that seems to characterize this subset and as Dr. Barlow was, ah, suggesting they're maybe continuum between the anxiety disorders and the personality disorders. I wonder if you could either of you could address the, ah, anxie-- the anxious of personality disorder. And what the implications are for treatment? Obviously, it's not gonna be just, ah, effort as I another, uhm, a clinicians have found to reduce symptoms. There's an underlying of disposition that somehow needs, ah, it needs to be treated and I'm not sure that our existing a dynamic therapies, ah, have really are all that effective at least the one's I've used with that, ah, with that constellation call the anxious personality. 

00:56:50
[sil.] 

00:56:55
DR. OTTO KERNBERG Do you-- do you prefer to take what comments before I... 

00:56:55
 No, please answer the question as they go alright. 

00:57:00
DR. OTTO KERNBERG Well, in I, I don't think have a direct answer to the question but a more general comments about what I think is going in the field. First of all I want you to thank, ah, Dr. Barlow for his very good interesting thought provoking discussion. And, uhm, he describes the scene exactly as it was it is and that's our major problem. I, I think what's happening with, uhm, ah, the field of personality disorders is that it's the area of psychiatry and clinical psychology that touches most directly day to day functioning of everybody. So it has, ah, psychosocial dimension that immediately gives an, an ideological dimension of political dimension in, uhm, and so the science gets complicated with politics that has happened-- that the committee structure that happens, uhm, whenever personality and personality disorders are, are discussed one problem. Second, reha-- there has been tremendous advance of research, a long numerous lines. In-- first personality is concerned em-- temperamental dispositions in terms of the study of general reactivity of the organism in terms affect, cognition behavior that's genetically determined present from birth on and we know more now about the, ah, neurotransmitters that are linked to different temperamental dispositions and that undoubtedly influence the way people can be classified introversion and extraversion as that, ah, follow indicated other big-- ah, a big illustrations of that. And, uhm, there have been classification of personality disorder but cloning just for example based on this contribution. On the other hand, from the, the view point of experimental psychology, other roads have been explode in recent years such as in rejection sensitivity and, uhm, ah, important determinants of rejection sensitivity and the crucial influence on that on behavior as brought entire set of new contribution to looking to personality. Then we have the research on attachment and the enormous important of insecure attachment in determining relationships from an-- infantile attachment up to the relationship between couples is aspect of personality. In for my psychoanalytic viewpoint there has been the studies by psychoanalytic procedures of hysterical personality which by the way was eliminated from, from DSM-III, IV from DSM-IV for mostly political reason called histrionic condensing the most severe form with the milder one. In, in-- the study of, uhm, sexual difficulty as a main model of those disorders, the narcissistic personality and the study of the model of a pathologic concept of internal grandiosity organizing the life of those patients. And from, uhm, this a view point of neurobiological functioning the relationship between limbic system and, uhm, uhm, and cortical structures my own work in that regard of that my institute has been concentrated in relation between amygdala, ah, free from narcotics and drugs still exploring that-- expanding it into the relationship between central aspects of the prefrontal cortex and the dorsolateral which is this have to deal more with the, uhm, conceptualization of experience of others. So, in entire new area has developing all of this but what has happened is that they have been operating separately and really have not been integrated. And, uhm, that's understandable because each set of scientist works within their own, uhm, parameters. But at the same time that has been a major weakness of the fields that work along the neurobiological dimension, the psychodynamic dimension, the psychosocial dimension has really not have been integrated and I think there is a conceptual problem that we have. I think the same is true when it Dr. Barlow mentions anxiety disorder that is, ah, very important approach, uhm, there is, ah, predisposition to, uhm, hyperactivity of, uhm, of, uhm, and negative affect systems, uhm, the HBA access or as a acute, uhm, manifestation of, ah, alertness and a more complex the, the in relationship between in accomplished deactivation of general anxiety the function, ah, of the amygdala on the one hand then, ah, they assumed thing effects of the serotonin system and, uhm, and, uhm, relationship between the, uhm, the positive, uhm, uhm, affiliating system of exotos-- of oxytocin is opposed of-- through activation of the general in anxiety reaction. For example, that is-- relates to a separation panic. So in my, my, my point is that it's, it's reasonable that each expert kinda knows the fields and when the experts get all together they are-- there are, uhm, massive questions will how do we put it all together. In here, I think as I mentioned before in there has been a neglect of a basic issue that the neurobiological system function not as isolated a neurotransmitters or neurocentral but, uhm, is in modules of combined intervention of the areas neurobiological systems. And that the psychological consequences of neurobiology becomes organized and organizing response in turn. What is the clinically the general agreement that the self is a central structure that, uhm, determines normality of, of pathology of personality. I think it is important an, an, important development but what is the self from a neurobiological standpoint when we think of our self, when we consider it, instead of being concentrated on external task. There's an activation of at least eight zones in the brain and we really don't know how the devil do they get activated simultaneously there are only theories about this. There is, uhm, the activation of the center that determines our position in, in, in space, uhm, in, ah, the auto-- biographical memory in them, uhm, the activation of our memory of significant relations with others, uhm, in them semantic, ah, uhm, memory of, uhm, the kind of complete task that we want to carry out. Different in, in the assessment, uhm, of our situation in the psychosocial environment, the assessment of the personality of the people who surround us in-- so the self is a flickering momentum-- momentary expression of neurobiology but in turn then determines of our behavior and the we have empirical evidence that we severe, uhm, fragmentation to self, lack of integration and severe psychopathology with certain types of treatment, ah, that we have demonstrated it transfer and focus psychotherapy is a treatment that, ah, produces it that self can be integrated and that integration has an influence in reducing the hyperactivity of the amygdala increasing the, the prefron-- the, the prefontal cortex reaction to negative situations. So, psychic structure in turn influences neurobiological one. So, it seems to me that we have to study neurobiological features, how they develop into a psychic system? How the psychic system in turn is expressed in various behaviors and the final manifest behavior therefore is the consequence of the interaction of these system and the, and the traits that we observe reflect the integrative function of what is determined by temperament in constitution by them learned organization of the central nervous system by the psychological integration of experience of self and others. And of course environmental feedback that's this build into this-- when we get to relate this with the system's theory approach will be able to then see what kind of classification can we carry out from a dimensional viewpoint both in terms of severity as a major dimension into the dominance for example of, ah, temperamental issues of early developmental issues of a, a cognitive influence and to what extent there are major dimension that cut across all this symptom, ah, all the systems and, and permit to classified personality. So, that is a task ahead of us in-- unfortunate in practice there is so much neutral bias between psycho-dynamicist and, ah, and, uhm, a neurobiologist and, ah, between neurobiologist and experimental psychologist that we have not reach that yet that stage of, of watching together. We-- its essential that we have into disciplinary studies and then I, I trust that this-- there will be gradual such encounter within neurobiology there are some leading international neurobiologist who have recognized that and are trying to work on this and talking about bank set in the United States about how to route in Germany who are working on this boundary between neurobiological and psychological study. And within psychoanalysis there are some people against the rigid self restrictive attitude of psychologic theoreticians who ignore completely neurobiology and, and they try to classify personality in terms of predominant psychological conflicts and again that's a rigidity on that side which cannot be, be accepted it seems to me but in the light of what we know. So, I'm, I'm, I'm talking in that regard for a, a combination of splitters and lumpers are very much agree with that. If it's general they have in, in the light of bringing about a better understanding in-- of them the way in which the human person and functions it's, it's very, very complex and I don't think that our looking at it from the specific viewpoints that don't take each other into consideration we are going to get very further will have a repeat of this DSMs until we, we reach such an integrated result. Unfortunately, the authorities that, that are in-charge of the DSM system they have their own theory and it's a kind of a linear theory we want to study the genetic disposition to neuropathology that determines pathological traits once we know all of these we'll know the right kind of medication and will cure everything we, we are suffering from and ideological motivated, rigidity in the system that needs to be overcome.

DR. DAVID BARLOW Others had a couple of a comments to, to, ah, spe-- specifically the, the question about the anxious personality. Uhm, I, I think, uhm, you know, that's an absolutely astute observation. And in our view in our current view, you know, what you're picking is simply than neurotic temperament that may not have, ah, let say been triggered into crossing the threshold of one disorder or another which seems in our view to depend on kinds of some, ah, specific, ah, early learned experiences, in terms of experiences with the, the panic or a, a types of intrusive thoughts one's have as well as a stressful, ah, you know, some kind of a stressful trigger. But preceding that and of out which all of this disseminates, you know, is a, ah, temperament and we think that temperament is neuroticism and has both, ah, ah, genetic and, ah, environmental inputs and currently, uhm, is a was going over yesterday. Uhm, what we've been spending the last several years on is designing a treatment that targets neuroticism directly. Ah, and we call it the, ah, unified transdiagnostic protocol for emotional disorders. And it's not just the anxiety disorders but across the, ah, mood disorders and again as I indicated the, ah, neurotic spectrum. So, any disorder characterized by a frequent intense negative affect that is, ah, inappropriately regulated. Uhm, in, in down place the specific, uhm, kind of a DSM, ah, symptom criteria. So, we're current testing that when, ah, this is large and I-- and I-- IMH, ah, clinical trial where we looking at end of-- the individual evidence-based protocols you were referring to, ah, psychological treatments for the disorders. Compared to this, ah, unified protocol which simply has five core, ah, change modules that can be, ah, applied depending on the, ah, needs of the patient. 

01:13:30
DR. DAVID BARLOW So, will have the results, ah, you know, the couple of years obviously but, ah, uhm, so that's some-- one direction we're taking toward looking at this. Not only anxious personality but depressive personality. The precursors to, ah, the development of disorders which we think represent, ah, kind of, of neurotic temperament and other temperamental characteristics. 

01:14:00
 We have time for one more short question. Yes. 

01:14:00
 Thanks. Speed round, ah, actually I have two short question. 

01:14:05
 Ah, okay. 

01:14:05
 Ah, one favor is Dr. Barlow, ah, they seeing potential for-- it's a common culture reference and addictive personality. Do you think we we'll see in DSM 5.1, ah, an addictive personality disorder, ah, along the same reasoning of maybe anxiety i-- it's personality based. And the second one is from my masters class, ah, for Dr. Kernberg, the personality is a, ah, pervasive system of experiencing in relating to the world. Can an individual have two co-existing personality disorders? 

01:14:45
[sil.] 

01:14:45
DR. OTTO KERNBERG You first. 

01:14:50
DR. DAVID BARLOW Okay, yeah. Uhm, well, those are-- those are both a very good questions, ah, the, uhm, in terms of the addictive personality, I mean my colleagues certainly working in the addictions talk about people who are particularly susceptible to, ah, uhm, addictions of various kinds they seem to be you know, ah, susceptible across the broad range and potentially addicting behaviors that's a actually good question why that neuro, ah, sort of kind of get on the, ah, nomenclature do you think that would be an important thing to recognized, ah, ah, assess, measure, develop some, ah, uhm, good indications of and, and, uhm, it should be in the nomenclature like honestly I can't tell you why it isn't. Although maybe my colleagues in the addictions have better, have better insight into that so it seems like a very reasonable thing. Ah, for the second part, ah, Dr. Kernberg. 

01:15:45
DR. OTTO KERNBERG Uhm, can two personality disorders exist, ah, co-- co-exist in it is, ah, a question justified by the confusion in the field. And I would, uhm, I would say that first of all in, in my view one has to decide on the degree of severity of the personality disorder and all personality disorders can be classified into those certain neurotic level, neurotic personality organization and at the borderline level, borderline personality organization that in turn can be subdivided into, ah, milder or less severe and more severe one. And that each patient can be classified along that continuum according to the criterion of whether there is an integrated concept of self and integrated concept of significant others that marks neurotic personality disorders that are characterizes by restrictive aspects of habitual behavior patents, rigidities, either of an inhibitory, or an exaggerated reactive type so that they have rigid pathological ways of usual behavior but in the context of an integrated sense of self and significant others, neurotic personality organization and they are different types of personality disorders within that level that may be mixed within that level. Borderline personality organization is characterized by lack of integration of the concept, lack of integration of the concept of significant others. In correspondent set of primitive defensive operations that show in behavior parts that can be diagnosed and, uhm, and, ah, contributes to the diagnosis together with the diagnosis of lack of integration of self and concept of significant others. And within that general constellation there are also different personality disorder that can be ranged from an introvert to that to an extroverted of type and then maybe mixed. And a sub-group of these disorders is of such severity that there is a breakdown in the three major life areas of working profession, love and sex. Social life and creativity. So, we study in addition to rigid character traits and or kind of secondary symptoms that stem to which these three areas are affected or the patients is still able to function and vent. Ah, finally the most severe cases have to be differentiated from a typical psy-- psychosis and all of this can be carry out in diagnostic interviews we have developed in particular interview that permits to do that, that can be learn so that the classification of severity in which type within each level, uhm, it can be assessed relatively easily. So, in short in response to your question, yes, somebody have mixed of various personality types within the same level of severity and from the view of treatment-- from the viewpoint of treatment it is the level of severity that's crucial. Although different constellations may require different approaches. So this I think is the great step forward, ah, of DSM-V, one could criticize the committee and all the previous committee that it took them 30 years to reach something that really 30 years was available well documented but ignored because all the political rigamaroles that, ah, that influenced, ah, those committees and, and, uhm, you cannot imagine how much frustration, anger and resentment developed in the cause of those committees and their work which indicates the, that non-scientific issues are an important aspect of what's going on in reason for our difficulty of putting our heads together. 

01:20:35
 Dr. Barlow, Dr. Kernberg I wanna thank you very much for your words today, your contributions that have been just amazing over the, the decades here. And I'd like to thank all of you for joining us with us.
