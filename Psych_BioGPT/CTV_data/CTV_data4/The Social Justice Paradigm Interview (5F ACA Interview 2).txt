5th Force: The Social Justice Paradigm Interview Judith A. Lewis, PhD., Professor, Governors State University Rebecca Toporek, PhD., Associate Professor, San Francisco State University Hugh Crethar, PhD., Associate Professor, Oklahoma State University 

00:00:30
UNKNOWN I'd like to begin by first thanking, uh, Dr. Judy Lewis, Dr. Rebecca Toporek, and Dr. Hugh Crethar for coming here today to talk about social justice counseling as really the fifth force in the counseling field. Uh, I kind of view social justice as the new and, and emerging paradigm that's really having a significant influence in terms of how we can practice a therapeutic run with clients. Um, I want to begin by just asking each of you sort of what got you into the social justice movement in counseling and sort of, um, uh, how did you get involved in this movement? And what about social justice resonates with each of you? 

00:01:10
REBECCA TOPOREK Well, I can start. Professionally I got involved in multicultural counseling first. Um, and in the process of understanding the whole process of multicultural counseling and my place in it as a person with numerous societal privileges. I started to recognize that the overlay that social justice had and for me as a, a white person particularly, um, social justice was a necessary part of becoming multiculturally competent. Um, so it sort of started that way. And also just practice experiences that I had where I started to really see clear injustice that the interpsychic approach to counseling wasn't adequate for a lot of the clients that I was working with and so advocacy and social justice was really helpful in looking at how to shape the work that I can do more effectively. 

00:02:00
UNKNOWN So it's really your sense of social justice and what got you involved was really sort of evolved from your own experience in terms of with multiculturalism and, and, and, clinical practice in a sense. In terms of the limitations of it, it sounds like. OK. 

00:02:15
JUDITH LEWIS I think what Rebecca was saying was really interesting, and I, I had a little bit different background, in terms of this question. For me, I was a social justice advocate first. And to me the counseling profession is an excellent way to make this a more just world. One of my, um, earlier professional experiences was, um, working in a school system in their first year of court-ordered desegregation. And that was a big eye-opener for me, because they brought us in as school community relations consultants and they idea was that we would help the kids learn to get along better. But what I found was that working with the kids was so easy. They wanted to know each other so much, and everything that the adults did proved that they didn't want it to work. The parents, the administrators, the teachers, everything in the environment worked against having these kids get along. A good learning experience for me. 

00:03:35
HUGH CRETHAR And Judy what you're saying I guess ties into the part of it that really drew me to look at counseling from a social justice perspective, um, it's um, I found on that most of the theories weren't really focusing as well on context as they needed to and- or at all in many cases. Um, and um, making assumptions that all problems are driven from individual choices and, and, and individual behavior, um, that- It happened, devoid of what was going on in society and what was in their environments and what was going on historically. All of those things weren't really factors. And, it just didn't make sense to me. Um, it didn't, it didn't fit into my, my lived experience and and to the experience of the people that I, that I served. And so, I kind of came through the route you were talking about, through multiculturalism, and, and what kind of kept me moving forward was part of the OK, so given that, what's- How does, how does it all apply actually with people making a difference in their lives. And, and that's where, where the social justice part started to come to life for me. 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN So it sounds like for all of you it's really been the limitations with, with all of these different theories and psychology and counseling that have the limitations you saw in each of those theories that have really, uh, the, forced you to look at, uh, uh, uh, different ways to operate and practice and really look at things from more of a contextual perspective, which I think multiculturalism allowed us to do, but what you're saying is, is the field of psychology and counseling really hasn't been, uh, uh, adequate enough in terms of being able to alter systems and that's really what social justice is, is, is about and what has caused you to sort of, uh, uh, uh, put so much of your energies, if you will, within this particular movement, so. 

00:05:40
REBECCA TOPOREK I think social justice counseling, the social justice paradigm has a lot in common with a humanistic approach in that both are, um, positive and look at human development as something that you want people to be able to control in their own lives. But I think that the big difference between them, what makes a social justice counselor different is that focus on the larger world, which means that you're helping your clients look at that larger world, you're helping your clients understand the impact of the environment on themselves. But also you're looking at your own work as going beyond that office and talking with a client to, uh, a larger effort at advocacy. So that it's all part of the same thing. Talking with a client, talking with a group of clients, talking with a legislature, talking with a parent, talking with the mayor- they're all part of the same effort. 

00:06:55
UNKNOWN That's interesting because it sounds like what you're saying is social justice counseling is really about helping clients understand their situation in context, helping them gain insight into their world from a larger perspective. Um, and, and using advocacy as a means to help alter some of the environmental barriers that can be impacting and impeding their development. 

00:07:20
HUGH CRETHAR And I think that really speaks to something that's really different, um, about what, what someone who works in this paradigm has to do. To do what you just described you have to have an awareness of the con- the multiple contexts of many peoples, and how those, how, how the different, how they affect each other. Um, so you, you can't help someone become aware of the political and social pressures and so forth in their lives if you're not aware of them yourself. You have to actually put in the work to understand other people's lives, and I think multiculturalism is what got me moving in that direction, but I don't see it as like the context, because there are a lot of- there's more to context than just culture. 

00:08:10
REBECCA TOPOREK I think one of the things, in terms of, uh, you know, my progression as I'm listening to both of you talk about advocacy and, um, and social justice and so multiculturalism is kind of where I started and looking at communities and trying to understand communities as a way of becoming more multiculturally competent and then recognizing the ecological aspects and so using an ecological system or theory to really understand the multiple levels that might be going on. Um, but then also looking at, uh, what could I actually do, you know, about all of this and, and trying to, um, have some idea of myself and how, how do I address some of these, so I started doing what I now call seat of my pants advocacy. Which is I wasn't ever really trained. It wasn't until I was a counselor that I started to become an advocate and activist and so I did what I thought needed to be done, and in reflection realized that I'm not sure I did it the best way possible, and that I feel like, um, there- It would be helpful to have more written, more guidelines, so that, so that the me who started when I was 22 as a counselor would have had a little bit more guidance about doing advocacy appropriately. Doing social justice appropriately specifically because I have so many aspects of privilege in my own background. So I think what you're saying, Hugh, in terms of understanding all of these different contexts, I also think understanding where do I fit in into that context in terms of my privilege, my understanding, my world view, all of those things and how I act, um, is influenced by those things, and I can use that in a positive way for the client and for addressing system- systemic change, um, or I could perpetuate oppression and the status quo, which is not in favor of the clients or the communities. So there's that balance, I think, of who I am and how I'm positioned, as well as where the clients are, as well as all those layers. 

00:10:20
UNKNOWN Layers, which, which for me when you talk about that, it's, it's complex. But it sounds like what you're both saying is that it really needs to start with the counselor, the therapist in terms of not only understanding themselves, in terms of who they are, and, and how does privilege play a part in their life and issues of power, but also, um how to conceptual fact- conceptual factors influence what's going on in the therapeutic realm. Something that you mentioned, Rebecca, that really resonates with me is, is we talk a lot about social justice in the field, but there's not really a guideline or framework or, out there in counseling and psychology, uh, that, that allows people to sort of have a framework to sort of, uh, uh, implement social justice initiatives and agendas and, and perspectives, if you will. Um, it seems like there's a lot written about what is social justice and how do you define it, uh, in less of a concrete sort of framework. It seems sort of like that's where we need to head in terms of in the field of counseling and psychology. 

00:11:25
JUDITH LEWIS I think social justice counseling is radically different from everything that we normally think of as counseling. That's why I think it's worthy of being called a fifth force, it really is different, because in some ways we're working with clients in a way that's the opposite of what the conventional wisdom says you're supposed to do. The conventional wisdom says you really have to have the client focus on what that client has control over, rather than having the client feel helpless because he or she sees so much going on outside of himself that affects. And what we're saying is that it's important for the client to look outside of himself or herself, and in a way it really is the opposite of what many of us were taught when we first got into the field. 

00:12:25
HUGH CRETHAR And adding to that, even if, even when we have our- and other, other therapies will do this, where they'll have people go and do something in regards to their environment, we also argue that it's our job to actually get actively involved in, in that change too, instead of just- You know, we have our 50 minute session or whatever and then tell them, OK now go do stu- go do the stuff we talked about. We also believe that we need to get involved in, in, in the disequities in the world and, and, and not just kind of be the cheerleader once a week for a certain period of time. 

00:13:00
UNKNOWN I think that's what I was getting at with what you were talking about was, was that for requiring or encouraging therapists and counselors and psychologists to do that, we need to be able to provide them with a framework in terms of how to be able to do that, um, uh. It seems like psychology's, we're very good with helping people work with clients on an indi- an individual level but not necessarily on a systemic level. I want to go back a little bit, and, and, and sort of ask you all, sort of how did this movement come, come to fruition. The social justice movement. How did it evolve? From your perspectives. 

00:13:40
JUDITH LEWIS You know, one thing that I think that we should be aware of is that even if there wasn't a framework, even if there wasn't um, a science. Even if there wasn't a literature, that for all the years that there have been counselors, there have been counselors who have been doing social justice work. School counselors who see the impact of, um, bad curriculum, uh, and bad disciplinary procedures on kids and try to protect them the best they can. Um, employment counselors and career counselors who see inequity and unfairness in hiring practices. They're have always been counselors who have done this work but it has been without their having been taught how to do this work when they were students. It's like well, one thing that we had talked about before is that it's like, you know, the difference between a people's history versus the written history of a people. There's the people's history of counseling and the counseling profession. There's a, there's a people's history of counselors as advocates and social justice workers, that's different from the more formal history that you see in the books. 

00:15:05
HUGH CRETHAR It is, it's even how we look at the formal history. I mean, we look at people like Gilbert Rannin and so forth. We can see that history playing out. It may- it's just how people choose to read the history I guess, um, because to me it, it feels like when I look back at the history of counseling as a field, way back in the beginning of time, um, we were advocates for change, at least in the career area, um for sure, and I think that perhaps as the field develops, some, some of us lost our way and lost some of that. And I think it's more being revived, and, and now honed better. 

00:15:40
UNKNOWN So it's not really a new theory or, or emerging force, it's, it's, it's something that's always- It sounds like what you both are saying it's been a part of our history from the very beginning. 

00:15:55
HUGH CRETHAR Yeah but it's become more formalized. I think we're getting a lot more, you know, there's been a lot more done about it now. People did it, but I think it's becoming a lot more a movement now. 

00:16:05
JUDITH LEWIS Well I think that's why we got involved in creating the advocacy competencies. Because we knew from a lot of people's experiences that there are ways to connect your counseling work and your advocacy work. And, um, and I think Rebecca speaks to that really well. She's always been involved in doing research on advocacy since, since the beginning. 

00:16:35
REBECCA TOPOREK Well I was just thinking with your question about how did it evolve? I have this image of different sort of roots coming together, because with it, whether it's in school counseling or career and employment counseling or in family therapy and um, in a lot of different places, uh, social justice like Judy was saying really was, was acted out, but I don't think it was, um, formalized. As Hugh said. You know, it wasn't written down in a way, training programs didn't talk about it. And so, um, I think one of the things that was really nice, and I don't know if this is an appropriate time to talk about the advocacy competencies but, but I think it did, um, sort of help to formalize and bring together some ideas about the, how do you work at an individual level? What does that look like? How do you work at a community level and what does that look like? And then how do you work at a, a larger scale, whether it's societal or at a policy level. Um, to, to do something that is counseling, um, and to use the skills and the talents and the training and the scope of what counselors do, um, but to address some of those larger, um, external issues that are really part of the problem, you know. Part of the problem as opposed to addressing the individual as the problem, um, and, uh, and so I think the advocacy competencies is kind of a way, drawing on all of those evolutionary forces and kind of bringing them together. So I think when you look at those competencies, they're informed by a lot of different, um, historical influences within the profession. But also I think that recognizing the contributions of other disciplines is important too. 

00:18:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, it certainly has. The competencies have certainly provided a framework to sort of, uh, implement social justice initiatives, I, I agree. Uh, and it seems like people- We have a language to call, uh, to use to call what we do now, whereas before people were- Sounds like what you are all saying is, have always been doing social justice work in the field but just didn't have language around that to describe that. Um, just real quickly, because I do want to talk more about the advocacy competencies. Um, just from, from you, if you can just sort of share a little about who you feel have been the major figures in sort of the evolution of the social justice movement, and or major events that have taken shape that have, uh, whether in counseloring or in society in general that have, uh, uh, uh, had a major impact in terms of the evolution of this particular paradigm in counseling and psychology? 

00:19:15
JUDITH LEWIS I think the feminist movement was very important. It was important to me. I was, I was in one of those confidence-raising groups where we talked about the personal as political and that was very meaningful to me, but it's not anything that anybody was talking about in terms of counseling at that time. 

00:19:35
HUGH CRETHAR And I think one of the better young theories, um, newer theories that we have has come out of that movement in a relational cultural therapy is I think, um, really been one of the, one of the strong theories that represent some of the, some of the principles in social justice movement. I'll give one example, just um, the difference in defining, um, what mental wellness is, um, they wouldn't really use that language. But instead of it being a self-esteem, it will be self in relation. So it's more about the relationships you have and the health of those, and how you define yourself through your relationships instead of just how you feel about yourself despite everyone else. Um, and that's just a really different way of thinking, um, and I'm not saying that theory is responsible for that so much as that's one of the key- one of a, one of a key variables. 

00:20:35
REBECCA TOPOREK Well I think that looking historically, there are a lot of figures in history that, that get identified as part of the history of counseling, like um, Frank Parsons obviously and in career counseling and employment counseling, uh, but a number of other people. I know for myself one of the things that I re- I clearly remember this, reading an article by Isaac Prilleltensky and saying, Oh my gosh, this is exactly what I've been thinking! Um, and so I just remember the joy of like finding people who were writing things, um, the community counseling book, um, Ellen McWhorter's work on empowerment, um, was really exciting because it was, uh, proof that there were people there that were thinking and doing this and, and talking about it academically but also talking about what does that look like as a framework, as opposed to just trying to address problems as I see them, but, but actually having a way of seeing things, um, that could be really useful. And that it was valid. I mean, that was the hardest thing for me was feeling like this wasn't validated through some of my training. Um, and so finding sort of whether they were, um, people who were historically involved in doing this work or people who were contemporary and doing this work that- That I think is really meaningful. 

00:21:55
UNKNOWN And it sounds like you're also saying I don't feel alone in this, there's other people that are like me, that think like me, so I don't feel like I'm alone and, and maybe I'm not going crazy. 

00:22:10
REBECCA TOPOREK Which is such a great parallel to social justice counseling because I think that's part of what we do is we, we work with clients to say yeah, no you're not crazy. This is actually not fair. Like let's take a look at who else is doing work to make this more fair. 

00:22:20
UNKNOWN And perhaps your reaction is actually normal. It's the environment that's sort of crazy and you're responding in a healthy way. Yeah. In terms of key concepts and, and theories and constructs in the field, um, what would you say those are, as it relates to social justice counseling as the fifth force? Talked about the advocacy competencies. 

00:22:50
HUGH CRETHAR I think that the issues that come out of that is certainly one of the, one of the key con- constructs that everyone refers to, when referring to social justice. Um, I think also, um, part of it is, um, looking at what you're, you're going to do advocacy work looking at what you're doing advocacy work about and why and I think that goes down to other issues of, of understanding the difference between equity and, and equality and understanding that, that, um, equitable, equitable access and, and, um, eq- equitable participation are important variables in the context that a person experiences and, um, along with that, within, you mentioned, um, Ellen's work on, on empowerment and I think, um, some, some of the constructs within that, within her definition in that work were really important to, to talk about the importance of, um, if a c- if a client is to become empowered, if a person is to become empowered that they need to realize that they need to find people to lock arms with, like we were talking about. People to have as allies. And, um, perhaps even to see that some people that you might be competing for what little piece of the pie society is allowing you are actually the people that you should be allying with against those who are limiting your access. 

00:24:15
JUDITH LEWIS I think the key concept is that people develop within environments and the environments can be very nurturing and the environments can put up barriers and our job in working with the clients is to try to find a way to find nurturing environments, taken environments that are around them and make them more nurturing and find ways around or over or under or somehow to get past those barriers. So at the same time that we're helping clients and students understand that, we're also recognizing that sometimes the student or the client is going to need us to help because in some situations we may have more power. 

00:25:00
REBECCA TOPOREK I think in terms of key concepts, um, the advocacy competency model has some of them embedded in it and so I just wanted to highlight that and I think one of the things that you were talking about, Judy, that's just an important part of that model is the advocacy with the client, um, in collaboration or partnership with the client, um, but then also advocacy on behalf of the client and so in the situations where, um, we may have a certain position or access in a way that the client is not able to have access just by virtue of our position in an organization, um, or whatever. Uh, that, that those are two distinctions, I guess, um, but then also, uh, empowerment as you mentioned, Hugh, and advocacy at the individual level. Community collaboration I think is a really key construct that, when it's described from a position of social justice and advocacy is different than when you talk about community collaboration in other contexts, um, so at, at the group or community level, the school level, um, you have community collaboration when you're talking about advocacy with a client group. Um, if you're talking about group advocacy on behalf of a group, then that would be, um, systems advocacy, uh, and then at a much larger level you have the construct of, um, in the model it's called public information. It's basically working on a large scale with client communities around an issue to educate the public but also work together about what, what is the strategy that we can use to address this issue that's affecting a lot of people? Um, and then on behalf of, uh, but may also include clients, would be social and political, um, advocacy, in terms of legislation or policy, um. And so those constructs I think are important to highlight because that is unique, I think, to other, um, forces. The other, the other forces may not include kind of that broad, um- You know, we talked about ecological levels, but this really kind of nails down some key constructs within each of those levels and what would that look like, um to actually do that with clients, um, in concert with clients or on behalf of clients, still being directed by clients but, um, but in- Functioning in a slightly different way. 

00:27:30
JUDITH LEWIS And hearing Rebecca talking about the advocacy competencies, one of the things I'm remembering is how surprised a lot of people were that when we designed the advocacy competencies, we had, uh, an important piece of it that was about how we worked directly with clients. That the way an advocacy-oriented counselor works with a client is different from the way other people work with clients. Maybe we were surprised ourselves when we hit that piece of it. And I think the reason people were surprised is that they think of counseling and advocacy as separate. 

00:28:15
UNKNOWN Separate. 

00:28:15
JUDITH LEWIS And we've always thought from the beginning as part of a social justice paradigm the idea is that it all starts with the client. That's why counselors are so good at social justice advocacy. Because we are among the first to see problems that are affecting so many people, because we learn from our clients and then we start to look outward and here's a client who's had a particular kind of problem and we can see it came from the environment, and then we look and find that that same problem at that school or that, or that community has been affecting lots of other people as well. And then you're on your way. 

00:29:00
HUGH CRETHAR I think going into another, I think a really big difference is, um, having less of a remediation perspective and more of a prevention perspective in, in our work in, in that, um, instead of just fixing those problems, just like you just described, we're also looking at how can we perhaps work on, work on the system and on the structure so that the problems aren't this, won't be the same for the next person that comes along and so forth. And that prevention mindset is built into our individual work, that's how the whole empowerment piece works. Is, you know, if, if they get to the point where they become more empowered they're, they're less likely to have those problems repeat or have something else crop up. And I think it's just an entire mindset away from just fixing that which is broken that- Or that which is bad or whatever, but also making it so that something else might not happen again. 

00:29:55
JUDITH LEWIS I just wanted to say that we really do not see the problem as within the client. And that's a key concept too. 

00:30:05
UNKNOWN Mmhm. So it sounds like some of the things you're talking about is empowerment, equity, um, um, um, looking at things more systemically, uh, intervening in the system as well as individually. Looking at things from a micro and macro-level, uh, perspective, um. How is it different, social justice counseling, as a paradigm, how is it different than social work? 

00:30:35
REBECCA TOPOREK That's a great, great question. 

00:30:40
UNKNOWN Because, because it sounds like what you're saying is, is counselors need to expand their understanding of, of clients' development and some of the barriers impeding their developments, uh, and if it's the system then counselors should and psychologists should intervene in the system. Isn't that like social work? 

00:30:55
REBECCA TOPOREK That's exactly what one of my professors said to me. In my doctoral program. Which, which energized me to actually talk about how it's relevant in counseling. Um, and so just briefly I'll say what I said at that point, which is the clients that I have don't have a whole staff of mental health professionals to turn to. They have me. And so, um, I can refer them elsewhere but that's doing a disservice. That's actually an ethical issue in my mind, that I have this person that I'm working with, and so, and they're facing these other needs, um, so I think that's really interesting because that's a criticism that comes up often and there are so many places where I think social workers get excellent training in terms of looking at systems, in terms of intervening in systems. Um, but I, I don't know that, um- There is a unique history that counseling has in terms of a focus on development, a focus on strength-based, a number of things, the vocational aspect, um, which is really strong within counseling and not so much in, in their trainings in social work. Um, but I think it is a valid and important place for advocacy to be, um, given what counseling is as a profession. 

00:32:20
JUDITH LEWIS I shrugged when you first asked that, about isn't that social work? But then it made me really think. I hadn't really thought through this, so this is a great learning experience for me. OK, here's what I'm thinking. Those forces are more important than the particular professional identity that, um, differentiates among the, that, um, that different job titles. I think that there are within the helping professions, a number of people who are social justice advocates. I mean, if anything, we're very close to community psychologists. So there are people who are social justice advocates and people who, um, adhere to different models. But I think they tend to cut across the, um, I think they tend to cut across the professions and to be more important than, than the professional titles. 

00:33:20
HUGH CRETHAR I think you're hitting on another key factor. When I, when I think about people, those, those in our circles that, that focus on this, we tend to value interdisciplinary work and to value multiple perspectives, instead of looking at, looking at things more as a turf. And it seems to be a pretty consistent construct across a lot of people I work with at least that come from this space. 

00:33:45
REBECCA TOPOREK And I think the other, the other response that I have a lot of times is, these problems are really huge. Like, to expect that one professional's going to be able to address all the inequities in society is, is very unrealistic. And I think is self-serving to some extent. Um, and so I think that the emphasis on collaboration that comes up in terms of social justice and advocacy like you were saying, going across disciplines, having people contribute what they know, their training from their particular view, their own profession's world view, and being able to look at problems from a variety of ways and bringing our strengths together, um, with clients, client groups, is I think really useful. So the work that's been done in prevention adds a lot to, um, the work that we do. Public health adds a lot to it. Social work does a lot. Law and there are so many professions as you said, Judy, where there are social justice advocates. And, um, I've learned a lot from especially students who come from other fields and come into counseling and um, community organizing. I love getting students from community organizing. And sometimes what they say is, we've been able to really do a lot at the community level but I feel like there's some- Like we're not attending to what's going on with individuals. What I want to get the counseling training so I can bring those two things together. Um, so I think, I think kind of the patterns that we see, like you were saying, Judy, is really useful and our ability to reach out to other disciplines or to accept them when they're reaching out to us is important in this, those definitions of who does what and who's allowed to do what, I think, is, is, if I were suspicious would say that would be a way of not actually addressing the big problems. 

00:35:35
UNKNOWN Well it sounds like a lot of what you're all saying is, is we need to move away from turf wars, um, and, and that's when clients come in, they're not really wanting to know, what is our title, but more so are concerned about, can you help me get to the root of my problem? Can you help me alleviate some of these issues that I'm dealing with on an every day basis? And, and what you're also saying is, how do we draw the best from different fields, uh, uh, and collaborate with each other to be able to help clients get the services that they may need. Which is a lot different than, um, the other counseling forces in the field. I'm wondering, what do you see as the role of the counselor who operates from a social justice framework? 

00:36:30
REBECCA TOPOREK One role is collaborator, uh, because I think one of the things that's, um, important in doing social justice counseling is being really cognizant of our role. Um, and so if we work a little bit as collaborators with the client and I think there's more of a chance that the direction that it goes in can be directed really by the client. Keeping in mind the cultural issues around whether expected roles are help-givers and being respectful and understanding that. 

00:37:10
HUGH CRETHAR So if I piece together what you just said in my mind I was trying to think of an answer, it'd be like a culturally intentional collaborative change agent. 

00:37:15
REBECCA TOPOREK That sounds good. 

00:37:15
HUGH CRETHAR That's kind of like if I pieced it together, that's kind of it. Because you're working at the individual and broader levels doing that. 

00:37:25
UNKNOWN What techniques are there, in this particular paradigm field? You talked about the advocacy competencies for example as a framework to implement social justice initiatives or perspectives, uh, and to address issues of equity that may be impeding on clients' development, but what would you say are techniques in order to uh, operate from this framework? Does that make sense? 

00:37:55
JUDITH LEWIS I'm trying to think of- I don't think I usually think of it so much as techniques as I think of it as kind of a framework for, a framework for helping the clients or students that I am there to help. And I've found that in, um, one of the things that I've worked on over the years is the community counseling model. And that to me is important because it, um, it sort of operationalizes in the same way that the advocacy competencies do. Because what I'm looking at is how you work directly with the clients and with the community and with the larger, um, systems and how you work on behalf of the individuals, the community and the larger systems. And I think originally, it was set up kind of as an administrative, um, as and administrative apparatus. So that, say if you had an agency, you would have all those pieces as part of it. But I think of it more now as a counselor's role, and that counselors have to do, um, a lot of these pieces that other counselors can get away with not doing. I mean, the reality is that as a social justice counselor a lot of the stuff that you do, you don't get paid for. It's like it's what happens on the weekends and you know, if you're a therapist in private practice, as a social justice counselor, and I know like one or two, and so what happens is that, yes, they um, make their living on the part of what they're doing which is working directly with the, with the client by the hour. But look at all the other things that they do on behalf of that client that's just part of what they do so they can do a better job. But they can't bill the insurance company for it. 

00:40:15
HUGH CRETHAR I've found in the last few years in my work and the feedback I get from students when I teach this, this and what they do in practice, that something that's kind of become kind of a technique but I never really called it that, but actually they call it back to me. They go, oh I used that, they call it the empowerment technique and I never called it that. But basically there are kind of like five basic steps that come out of Ellen McWhorter's work, uh, that kind of take you through a process of enabling a person to become more empowered. I, we don't really give people empowerment so much, but helping them to work through that process and you know, it's kind of, we talked about the first step already. You know, that, you know, that, having the awareness of the forces around you that affect you. Then, then going into, um, being able to take some control over, um, portion of that within, within your context. And then looking to ally with other people that have similar struggles or comparable struggles and lock arms. To, um, the next step is, um, doing, doing that without stepping on someone else or pushing someone else down. And the final step of that is, you know, you're not always, say, you're not truly empowered if you're, you forget where you came from. And so that last part is what are you doing to help others along, now that you're in, you're in a better space. And that kind of five step thing, um, kind of serves as a template, like you were saying, but when working directly with someone in session, even. Um, and to me it serves as I guess a technique in a way. I just, I never really called it that, my students started calling it. They'd say, well I was using your empowerment technique, and I said, well A. it's not mine, and B. I'm not sure it's a technique, but I can see where you're coming from. 

00:42:10
REBECCA TOPOREK I think the nice thing is that there are a variety of techniques or a variety of approaches. Um, so, so this is one and then, um, a colleague and I, Bob Chope, have a chapter on career counseling from a social justice perspective. And we have five or six, I think six steps in that and, um, and, I think there are a lot of different contributions to doing this advocacy competencies has some very specific strategies in there. Um, if I were to try to distill down what the components would be in practice, I think one of them is having a clear assessment with the client about what they identify as being the issues that they're facing, both internally and externally and in relation and all of that so really having an idea about it and then having some ideas of, um, what the goals might be then. At that point, I think in some cases there is a- some very specific issues coming up like, let's say a harassment in the school. Well if that's the issue that's coming up then that might entail a different approach than sort of daily microgressions that happened that someone is really trying to deal with and, and so that might be slightly different in terms of how it is. I think the other aspect that's important is agency, um, and working with the client to, uh, define ways of having more agency, having a sense of agency. There's a great chapter in, uh, Ethione Alderondo's edited book, uh, the chapter is by Lewis, different Lewis, um, but it talks about, uh, it's a reflection on one of his clients taking action, sort of, but seemingly is unrelated to the issue that she brings into counseling but it's, it's a means of this client really coming to appreciate and help and feel some empowerment around helping homeless people which actually tied in with what her clinical issue was, which was abandonment but not homelessness. And so there, there are these parallels, so I think, I think there are techniques but I think there are some principles that kind of, um, run across a lot of different techniques. And some of that is the collaboration with the client, like I said. Agency and finding ways of addressing external barriers, really evaluating those external barriers, I mean validating the existence of them and then looking at ways of actually addressing them. Whether it's the counselor themselves in concert with a client or, um, or the client themselves. 

00:44:50
JUDITH LEWIS I think that we have a technique that's our own as social justice counselors and that is that when we're working with a client we need to draw from that client ideas about what the client sees as having an impact on him or her from the environment. And that's something that even should be part of the assessment, the way we conceptualize, I don't want to say a case, because when they say case conceptualization, I, I don't like to call people cases. But conceptualization of, uh, what the issues are that are affecting this client is very different, if you're looking at it from that broad perspective. You know, if you're looking from the wide-angle lens instead of the microscope. 

00:45:45
HUGH CRETHAR What you're describing to me is, talks about how our, our, our clientele are experts on their own lives and experiences, and how it's not our job to take a top-down stance and construction of goals that we do that as- And I know others talk about this but I really think this is something I stand strongly on. We co-construct our goals. We don't do goals for ever. 

00:46:05
JUDITH LEWIS But we do have to help the client draw this out because people aren't accustomed to being allowed to talk about that. 

00:46:15
HUGH CRETHAR And that's what- When I hear the word co in the there, that's where it's not- You just, you- I have heard some students say, Well I just take the goals from whatever the client says she or he wants to do and I... 

00:46:25
JUDITH LEWIS And then I write them. 

00:46:25
HUGH CRETHAR Yeah and they just write down what they said. Well that's not quite it, because you have to do what you just described. You have to actually pull them to a space where they really think about it at a deeper level, and, and come up with a real goal that they want to work on. And then come up with some way to actually measure that there's changes happening. 

00:46:45
JUDITH LEWIS And it's not just goals. I mean some clients you have to work really hard to get them to find something good and positive about themselves that makes their life worth saving. 

00:46:55
HUGH CRETHAR Yeah. 

00:46:55
UNKNOWN So it sounds like you're saying it's really strength-based and the therapeutic relationship is one that is collaborative and, and egalitarian. The therapist or psychologist or counselor isn't necessarily one who is the expert, necessarily in the client's life. Uh, but the client is and the therapist is really facilitator in the process of helping them understand their situation. 

00:47:20
HUGH CRETHAR That goes back to the language that Rebecca was using, in the collaborative. It's a very collaborative relationship. 

00:47:25
REBECCA TOPOREK You know, this- I'm reminded right now of a conversation I had, uh, last August when I was going, starting back to classes and feeling like, Ugh, I'm teaching all these counseling classes again and I've been doing all this advocacy talking and social justice talking and I was having a hard time reconciling how I had all of these students who were entering because they liked the individual relationships and I was going to be telling them that actually it needs to be broader and so I was talking with my co-editor of the Journal for Social Action, um, in Counseling and Psychology, Todd Sloane, and I was asking him how, how does he view the process of counseling. Whether it's traditional, or the other forces, um, or social justice counseling. How does he view that in terms of social justice and he said something that was really profound to me, it was really helpful, actually, for me, was he said, sometimes I think that what we're doing is working with somebody who's gone through so much that they're not able to actively participate in change, in social change in their life or in the larger democracy, quote unquote. Um, and so sometimes we're working with somebody to help them gather the strength back up, um, to maybe whether it's to find their assets, find their strengths. But also heal enough so that they can be really active participants, um, in a way that they may not be able to when they first come in. Um, and that was really helpful for me because it helped me. I've been sort of really working at- there's the external and the internal, and, and there are issues at both levels, you know, it's not to say that every individual, you know, ought to blame their environment for everything. You know, there's some way in that assessment process, that co-, um, construction process of looking at, OK what parts of it are things that, um- We're looking at the outside, what parts of it might shift the way that I'm interacting with my family, with my community, whatever. That, that there's like a dance almost, um, a collaborative dance, uh, that they may do to figure out how all these pieces are fitting together, um, and how can, how can they have the strength to take agency in, in the ways that are meaningful and important to them. But also the larger community. 

00:49:50
UNKNOWN And it sounds like what you're describing is, is a very value-laden process, which is counter to how counselors are traditionally trained in terms of needing to be neutral, and, and what you're saying is, is, is maybe that's not the effective, most effective way to work with clients. 

00:50:05
REBECCA TOPOREK I, I honestly have to jump there because I think that counseling is not value-neutral. I don't think it ever has been. I think what, um, what some different approaches, qualitative research is a great example I think. It's bringing the value to the surface and saying, OK we acknowledge that there, there all value systems in place. So if I were to say the value system in social justice counseling, it's equity. It's, um, that people should have access to, uh, basic rights, basic survival, basic participation, um, and there are ways in which my values- It's a value for wellness, really individual community family wellness, um, and it's how I see that as being, um, the way to get there may be slightly different than a, a different force. But I think every force has its set of values and assumptions and expectations. 

00:51:05
JUDITH LEWIS And having these, having these opportunities for helping development available- doesn't that seem like a human right? That no one should miss. 

00:51:20
HUGH CRETHAR I think that brings us in a way to- That the ethical undertones of this whole thing, that ultimately I think we all share a view that it's an ethical imperative to work from this model or something akin to it. Um, because ultimately, if, if you're not then you're basically placing all, all the blame for all, everything on, on the individual, when it's not actually realistic. 

00:51:55
REBECCA TOPOREK That's actually how, when I talked about early in my career really finding social justice and advocacy as an approach, it was in part out of feeling like I was not practicing ethically by only addressing these individual problems within the individual that I was actually potentially doing harm. Because there were all these other factors that I was not able to take into account adequately, and I don't feel like, I, I didn't feel like I had the skills really to do that, and so I was limited in terms of, um, how I could really work with clients and in that limitation I think, um, there's danger of the- not practicing those basic ethical principles, you know. Um, beneficence, and the non-maleficence. Especially those, um, even veracity and fidelity and um, looking at autonomy is one thing that I think is where social justice has been criticized but I actually think it's a really important principle within social justice counseling in terms of what we've been talking about a lot in terms of collaboration with the client, what the client's autonomy, um, is their decisions. I think that also brings up challenges sometimes when we might feel like something systemic needs to be addressed and the client feels really strongly that that's not someplace they want to go right now, um, for feel of repercussion, or, or any of those things. And I think one of those things that we need to do as a field is to, to really grapple with some of these challenges of, you know, how do we, um, pursue, uh, a path with the client in a way that's going to be, um, in the best interest of the client, given all of these really tricky parameters that are out there. Even things like working at the community level, what is informed consent look like when it's not just an individual. Fortunately in community counseling and in prevention, there has been some written in that, but, but it is a different way of framing those kinds of ethical questions, um, that I think would really be valuable to, to develop more. 

00:54:15
UNKNOWN You talked a lot about benefits, uh, for clients in terms of operating from a social justice paradigm, what are the benefits for counselors, therapists and psychologists from this particular model or framework, if you will. 

00:54:30
[sil.] 

00:54:35
JUDITH LEWIS I think you learn about the world, and I think you gain courage. You know I, I think that we have to be careful that we don't get just so into this is our theory that we use with other people that to be effective social justice counselors I think we have to have social justice work in our own personal lives as well. That we have to find the courage, and it does take courage. We have to find the courage or how are our clients going to? 

00:55:10
HUGH CRETHAR I have to agree with that. I, I, in the past few years I've come to, um, actively seek experiences of cognitive dissonance where, in other words what I'm saying is I, I, I- Instead of running away from those uncomfortable times when I'm wrong, I kind of embrace it. It's like it, that, it's- That scariness of being wrong all this time about something is, is that on the other side of that, that is the rush of actually being much more right than you were before, and so I'll actually seek out information from multiple sources and from people who I think I might not agree with and, whatever. Because I want to go through that discomfort. I, I want to- My best friends are my friends who call me out on accidental errors in, in language use for instance. And I, I appreciate that. I, I'd rather grow, and I think that's, that's what I'm getting from what you're saying is. I think it's kind of exciting because you're always learning and growing. 

00:56:20
REBECCA TOPOREK I would say that's what the benefit that I personally have gotten is that it feels like I've grown. In terms of personal insight and relationships but also in terms of skills, um, because there's a wide range of skills and, and when, um, when I look at the building blocks that we have within counseling training, of group dynamics, of, um, looking at, really listening and understanding and, and being able to hold disparate concepts at the same time, um, and then expand that to some of the other skills that are needed at the different levels, um. That's been really exciting and useful for me. And at the same time I always need to question what's my motivation for being involved in advocacy and social justice with every client, just as with any other theory, whether we call it counter-transference or any other theory really needs to look at that aspect and I think it's the same, um, within social justice counseling. The other aspect, um, that does come up, I think is important to talk about is the pragmatics of this practice. Um, Janet Helms had a great article in 2003 about the pragmatics of social justice counseling and some of the things she talked about were the, you know, managed care and medicalized system and you know, what gets reimbursed and while- You know, one of the struggles for me was the idea of service. The way that I was brought up was that this is a service but I have to acknowledge that's actually- I can't function very long that way, um, that somehow the system has to be changed in such a way that actually the wholeness of health is included, um, and that the job of counselors, the job of health professionals in general looks at that whole, that wholeness. Because I think that's where students and practitioners have difficulty maybe very committed, but in terms of paying the rent, um, it's, it's difficult to figure out how to make that happen. 

00:58:25
UNKNOWN And it sounds like you're talking about, this is one of the limitations of the social justice counseling perspective. 

00:58:30
REBECCA TOPOREK No, I would say challenge. I wouldn't say limitation. 

00:58:30
UNKNOWN Or challenge. OK, OK. What, what would other challenges be then in terms of, for counselors who want to operate from this paradigm, beyond what you just discussed? 

00:58:40
HUGH CRETHAR I would build off that a little but I think we really need to look at how, how much we have moved to embrace the medical model and, and as a field and how we really need to reevaluate that and, and, and look more from a wellness model and look more at prevention. And, um, maybe find ways to redefine how we make a living doing what we do. Maybe that's the same thing you were saying but I think it's a key variable. 

00:59:15
JUDITH LEWIS I think we're coming into a good time, though. I mean, there was a time, maybe it was about 10 years ago, it seemed like I was fearing for the helping professions. Because I would see so many students who thought that nothing was as important as knowing the DSM, I guess it was the three R at the time or four. It was nothing- Nothing seemed as important as being able to identify what the category was for that particular person. And there was a lot of pride in, um, diagnosis as the center of your being. And I think that we've gotten, uh, I think we've gotten quite a ways past that. 

01:00:00
HUGH CRETHAR We still have to fight against movements to have one prescribed response to a given diagnosis, which is a movement that seems to be happening in parts of our field. And, I, I, I think that's going to be an ongoing challenge and I think it's being pushed by payors. And I think that ultimately HMO, HMO, PPO world and all that has been pushing that to a certain degree. We're also, many of us, embracing that without really even discussing it. I think that's a, that's a challenge that we really need to work on. 

01:00:30
JUDITH LEWIS So what we're talking about is the extreme challenges of being not social justice counselors. Look how much trouble you get into. 

01:00:40
UNKNOWN What do you see as the future of the social justice counseling perspective? Where do you see it going in the future? 

01:00:50
REBECCA TOPOREK Well I'll say one of the things that I think for future is related to challenges, um, like other fields, other perspectives, other, um, ways, uh, the ethical issues I think we have to get much more complex in terms of our thinking about ethics, um, in relation to social justice counseling as well as any other type of counseling, um. But I think that social justice counseling actually has some really good thinking to add that, that not only would influence what we call social justice counseling but also other counseling. I'm not sure how, how it could persist as being good counseling without being social justice counseling, but that's a different issue. But I think some of it is also really looking at some of the ways that, like for example participatory action research and other types of research strategies that can be really useful for counseling in terms of thinking about how to really work collaboratively with communities and with clients to, to advance the way that we understand issues and problems to even advance the way we understand how to act, how to be, how to be counselors and advocates and activists, um. so I think those are some of the things for the future. I think there's so much more that could be written. There's a lot of great stuff that has been written historically but also especially I think in the last ten years there's been more that's labeled itself social justice anyway. 

01:02:15
JUDITH LEWIS And I think we're going through a, we're going through a process that's kind of like what we went through with, um, say the multicultural competencies. And that is that the realization that multicultural competencies were important. At the same time that you had to notice that the people who were teaching and supervising counselors were people who never had been taught those competencies themselves. So we had to, you know, get through some sort of mini generations in order to get to a place where there was, there was a decent number of people who were really building their professional work around those competencies. And I think that we're moving in that direction. I, I think we've, I, I think we've had a lot of movement. 

01:03:10
HUGH CRETHAR I think it reflects back to even the ways that the multicultural movements, um, have been changing too and developing. I think that the social justice movement has actually impacted it. I mean, you look at all of the work that's being done in microgressions, for example, and, and, and how we don't just talk about them and have an awareness of them but actually are moving towards bringing, um, work on experiencing microgression into our therapeutic work. And I, I think that that's just an example of kind of how things are- It's, it's integrating. It's, it's, I think, um, if we do what we should do, it should just become the norm in all counseling. If they're not going to be social justice counseling, it's just counseling that has this bend, this wave has rolled over it and changed it. 

01:04:00
UNKNOWN Last question. What is the recommendation that you would give for an emerging counselor, a graduate student who's interested in operating from this paradigm, what's something you would recommend for them that could help them emerge into a social justice, uh, advocate, if you will? 

01:04:20
JUDITH LEWIS I think they should find some people in their own communities to work with as people and to find some opportunities for advocacy work in their own lives, so they have a better sense of it before they're trying to teach it or, or collaborate about it with their clients. 

01:04:40
HUGH CRETHAR I couldn't agree more. I think that service learning approach to social justice is probably the most powerful. Um, we as educators should try to embed it in our classes, where people have those experiences. It didn't help them, help them have them themselves but in- also they should go out and seek them, but, you know, maybe as groups or alone or however but go do it. Once, once you get out there, you're changed. 

01:05:10
REBECCA TOPOREK And I think also finding mentors in the community, whether they're, um, other counselors or people in other disciplines to learn from each other. Um, and also I really appreciated what you said, Hugh, about, um, having people around you who will make you aware of things that you may be haven't been expanded to. Um, which is also- I really resonate with that because that was really really important in developing myself as an activist in terms of having people around who could say, you know, I wonder about the way you just said that and how that might come across to somebody else, or watching people who actually take risks and are activists and, and really addressing whatever fears that I might have about standing out, or, um, you know, dealing with my own socialization, as a woman, but also just within my family about speaking out and being assertive- not just assertive but actually standing up against something that could be, could have negative consequences and finding people and watching how they do that and also really learning from them. I think this is important that fortunately there are some really good things written as well. We had in the Journal for Social Action, uh, several issues ago had a series of narratives from counselor and psychologist activists talking about how did they develop as activists. And I think that was, that's really nice, um, for me to read, because it helps me get an idea, number one that not everybody develops in the same way. I mean I like the way our conversation opened up because it really speaks to how people come to this work differently, um, and the different things that impact them so I think reading about it but also developing those relationships, um, of people that you can trust and watch and learn from, uh, as well as be allies with is really important. A couple of other resources, we talked about people as resources but also in terms of some of the other things that have been written that I would really recommend is, um, there was a special issue in the Journal of Counseling and Development, a special section, uh, of five articles. One that's an overview of the advocacy competencies model and that's the most comprehensive discussion I think of the model right there. Um, and then that's followed by four other articles looking at the individual level, and the community level and societal level and then a couple of kind of wrap up articles, um, so that I really recommend. There's also the edited volume of, um, advocacy competencies, which you were the lead editor on, which was also really, I think, valuable and important and looks at different settings, different populations, and how different people apply advocacy competencies to different types of counseling situations, um, counseling people. There are also a number of handbooks, a handbook for social justice that I had the pleasure of editing, has some good things. I mentioned one, um, edited by Etione Alderondo, which I think is really useful. Cortland Lee also has an edited one, um, that I think is very useful. Those are just some of the- It's exciting because there's more. The community counseling book, um, Judy that you worked on is really really important for people to also look at because it, it gives a framework that's, I think, really critical and integrated into social justice. 

01:08:30
UNKNOWN And it sounds like what you're saying is there's a lot of literature out there that hasn't existed in the past that can really help inform students so that way or even for emerging counselors so that when they get out in the field they'll have a solid theoretical foundation of, of what it looks like and how to sort of operate from this paradigm. Well I just want to thank each of you for taking the time out of your day to talk about really your passion in how you live out social justice, uh, everyday and then to really help us gain a better understanding of social justice counseling as the fifth force in the field.
