SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Welcome to Therapy Talks, powerful ideas for modern practitioners. I'm Dr. Shannon Dermer from Governor State University. And I am hosting this series of innovative talks presented by Alexander Street Press. We will focus on important topics in counseling for the trainee, professional and educator. Experts in the field of counseling will offer solutions to some of the most challenging issues modern practitioners face. Today we have the honor of Dr. Katherine Helm joining us. Dr. Helm is a licensed psychologist, and a professor and graduate program director at Luis University. She specializes in couples counseling, sexuality issues, training and supervision, treatment of trauma and multiculturalism. She has published on racial identity, infidelity, and is co-editor of the new book, Love, Intimacy, and the African American Couple. She will be speaking to you on the topic of culturally sensitive counseling in her therapy talk, culturally sensitive guidelines for nonblack therapists, working with African American couples. Please welcome Dr. Helm.

DR. HELM So, about five years ago, I got a phone call from a woman requesting couples counseling for she and her husband. At the agreed upon time and day, I go out to the waiting room, to greet the couple. Here's what I see, the couple appears to be in their early to mid 40s. They are covered in tattoos, on each arm and multiple piercings, and I thought, well this is going to be interesting. So I bring them back to my office, and I begin my initial assessment. They begin telling me how they met, what the problems were, I found out they had a mutual history of substance abuse, although they had been clean and sober for quite a while. They met in a 12 step program, and then they told me they were from an area of the city, which I know as pretty typically, very hostile to African Americans. Well I will admit to you I checked out, I thought to myself, oh, this is never going to work. They are never going to listen we are not going to form a relationship, this is not going to happen. And so, I probably then just missed other things that they were saying. So, the assessment went on, and I went on asking routine questions, and then I mentally shook myself. I mean what was I doing? I wasn't connecting with the couple at all, I heard they were from an area of the city, that was hostile towards African American and I ceased to do my job. And that is not okay. And it is especially not okay when I tell you that I am a student of multicultural issues. I teach classes to do with multicultural counseling, publish in the area of multicultural issues, and here I was judging this couple. I judged them so significantly, that it effected my ability to join with them. So today I am going to talk to about culturally sensitive guidelines for nonblack therapists, non-black uh, counselors working with African American couples. But I want you to remember, that I too despite my knowledge base, am significantly guilty of using my assumptions in therapy with clients. I think that part of being culturally sensitive has to do with being aware of what your doing and how your own biases are effecting the process. So, we look at important beginnings, how should you begin to connect with your African American couples? The first begins with understanding and acknowledging particular contextual factors. For example, the legacy of slavery, which are like toxic fumes that we all breathe in that impact our understanding and knowledge of race relations in the United States, and we are completely unaware. I think that from the legacy of slavery comes a few things, systemic racism, institutionalized racism, as well as internalized racism, that the couples themselves may have internalized some of the very negative stereotypes about African Americans. And then, they may treat each other based on those negative stereotypes without even being aware of it as you can see from the very first example I gave you, we are all sometimes guilty of doing this. Derryl Wing Sou talks about micro-aggressions, which are daily slights or insults, sometimes consciously or unconsciously perpetuated, that a person of color, gay or lesbian individual, and sometimes even based on gender, for example being a women or perpetuated against a person of color. One of the things that happens is, the person then feels hurt or angry and may not know how to react to it. what I find with African American couples, is that they frequently then take these out on one another. Their frustrations for having experienced a racist act or a micro-aggressions. Now, the American Psychological Association says that cultural competence is based on knowledge, skills, and awareness. I think that awareness is the key to these things. One of the things that non-black counselors working with African American couples should keep in mind is recognizing the diversity of African American families. For example, African American children can be raised by grandparents, aunts, uncles people not related to them, and have significant relationships with even the play uncle, or play aunt down the street. So, recognizing that you should not compare African American families, through a Eurocentric model of a nuclear family, of mom, dad, and kids. I also think that non-black counselors need to recognize their own sense of privilege. Now, privilege is defined as something that may systematically advantage one population while at the same time systematically disadvantaging another. For example, I have educational privilege, sometimes people assume I am smart, whether or not that is the case I'll let you figure that out. Um, because I have Doctor in front of my name as a professional title. I also have light skin privilege. Even though I am African American I may get better treatment in society based in my lighter skin tone, that I may not have earned. Non-black counselors who are white may have white skin privilege, and African American couples are aware of this. They are aware that privilege exists. So, I think one of the things that a culturally sensitive non-black counselor working with African American clients needs to do, is acknowledge their own sense of privilege. Maybe not to the client, but one can do this by being aware of their own privilege and the fact that that impacts the counseling sessions with the clients. Lots of different types of African American couples present for therapy. Married couples, never married couples, never going to get married couples, gay couples, co-habitating couples, and maybe even a couple that’s not romantically linked, yet has a child together, and that they are raising separately. So, again, African American couples may be very sensitive to the fact that they may be being judged against the standard that is not their own. I believe it is especially important for non-black clinicians, working with African American couples, to build and maintain the relationship. And I believe this is done by honesty and genuineness. Being who you are builds the relationship. Not being who you are in some ways, is dishonest, and clients can see through that. Some African American couples working with non-black therapists, may immediately appear to be resistant, or may have what's known as cultural mistrust. This may be because they are afraid that the clinician may be pathologizing them. Society tends to depict a very negative view of African American relationships, and they may be sort of on guard in therapy. Additionally, going to counseling or therapy may not be something that is culturally appropriate for many African American couples. They may prefer to see their pastor, if they are religious, or not to go to couples counseling at all, because they were raised with the notion that you should not put your business in the street. Nancy Boyde Frankline especially talked about the importance of joining with the couple, especially non-black counselors working with African American couples. Joining is an act of becoming a part of the couple's dynamic, and this builds credibility. I think that credibility is built through not only honesty, genuine-ness, and empathy, but also through self-disclosure. With the couples that I work with, I frequently self-disclose, appropriately, relationship issues that I have had, past or present so they could see I too am a work in progress. We are all works in progress when it comes to connecting with our romantic partners. African American couples typically like it when counselors self-disclose things appropriately about themselves, that’s relevant to the issues that they have come in with. I think that having a sense of cultural awareness, your own sense of awareness about a cultural being, as well as your own particular knowledge about the realities of life for being black in the united states is important, it’s also important that you are able to modify treatment approaches. And this is done by understanding particular contextual factors. For example, understanding the legacy of slavery, the possibility that internalized racism is at work. Negative internalized gender stereotypes, for example, uh, society frequently depicts African American men as being threatening, criminals, unmotivated, and unable or unwilling to have long term romantic partnerships, as well as being hyper sexual. Society might also depict being African American as being domineering, overbearing, emasculating, and unfeminine. And these stereotypes may sometimes be passed down in African American families, as well as perpetuated within the couple's relationship, unknown to them. So, non-black counselors working with African American clients, need to be extremely aware of these contextual factors. And not only be aware of them, but openly acknowledge them and assess how they are operating in the relationship. So, specifically, I think there is some specific considerations non-black counselors need to keep in mind. One is being open and honest. Two, is definitely being aware of and acknowledging your own sense of privilege and not being afraid to communicate this to the client. Third, not over, not misinterpreting cultural mistrust. It doesn’t tend to be personal, but born in a cultural reality for being African American in the United States. Be aware that most African Americans going to counseling know that they are pathologized in society, and there is a long history of that, that does not get erased immediately. And yet, your job is to join with the couple, in spite of that. It can be easily done. Let's go back to my earlier example, my huge mess up with this couple. So, there are many mistakes that I made, operating on my own assumptions, just visually even, and then, continuing these assumptions as I'm working with the couple. But there is one thing that I did right. One thing that I was correct about. I was aware enough of my own biases and judgement that I was able to correct myself in the process, and join the couple by the end of the first session. I actually continued to see them, on and off, for about two and a half years and had a very good relationship with them. I was wrong about all of my judgments, they were very smart, motivated, therapy savvy, and taught me a lot. And I think the same is true with all couples that you see. They will teach you something. So, I think that the key, in closing, to being a culturally sensitive counselor, a non-black counselor working with black couples, has to do with your own sense of awareness. And when you find these biases operating within you, acknowledging them and then being able to correct yourself in the moment, before you are, before it interrupts with your ability to join with the couple, or it negatively impacts the process. I likened racism and the legacy of slavery to fumes, toxic fumes we all breathe in, we are frequently unaware of those fumes. It is our responsibility to become aware of the fumes and how they impact us as an individual, and impact our work as clinicians. Thank you.

THERAPY Talks

[music] 

00:13:30
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Dr. Helm, excuse me, thank you so much for that conversation, I think this is an important therapy talk to have, um, for clinicians and for educators and for those in training. And one that is not very comfortable sometimes. 

00:13:45
DR. HELM I agree. 

00:13:45
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Uh, if you don’t mind I want to start off with a little story of my ah, hah moment. 

00:13:50
DR. HELM Sure. 

00:13:50
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D When I figured out some of this stuff as a doctoral student. 

00:13:50
DR. HELM Sure, we've all had em. 

00:13:55
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D I've had plenty of those. 

00:13:55
DR. HELM Still do, okay. 

00:13:55
Shannon Dermer Ph.D. 

00:13:55
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Uh, I was working um, on a military base, doing some in home family therapy. And I had a co-counselor, she was African American, a little bit older than I was, uh, I am if you hadn't noticed, uh, not black, so I was the non-black. 

00:14:15
DR. HELM I didn’t notice. 

00:14:15
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Well, you know, I was the non-black, uh, counselor, or therapist. And um, we were working with an African American family who lived on a military base, whose roots were kind of, from the south, and so there were a lot of, there were some commonalities, and a lot of differences, the southern background, um, the fact that they were African American, the fact that they were in a military culture, which was very foreign to me. Um, and uh, we were doing family preservation, which was meant that we were there to keep a child from being removed from the home. There was an adolescent that was acting out a lot. And so it was to keep her in the home, not to go to, what are those, at that time I think they were called detention centers, now I think they are called attention centers. 

00:15:00
DR. HELM Okay. 

00:15:00
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D But, um, not to get in too much trouble so that she would be removed from the home. And, one of the things that I noticed was with my uh, my co-therapist, who was African American, is that the family would be talking about something, and I would have no idea what they were talking about. But, she'd sit next to me and go mm hmm, mm hmm, and um, the family would be like, that's right, you know what we are talking about. And she had this incredible joining with them, and afterwards we'd drive back to the university, and I'd be like, I was completely lost. I have no idea what they were talking about, what were they talking about. And she's like, I don’t know. And I was like, but you kept going mm hm, and she's like sometimes it's just about making them feel comfortable. You know. Good job. And um, and she had this credibility with them because she was African American. And the following time that we went in the grandmother was visiting and they warned, they warned me before grandma walked through, they were like, if grandma isn’t nice to you, don’t worry about it, um, she doesn’t like white people. So don’t take it personally. And I thought, and this was one of the things that um, my co-therapist and I had a conversation on the way back was her automatic credibility, that she had with them, and also I was offended that, I'm like grandma doesn’t know me, why would she uh, automatically not like me, just cuz I am white. And as soon as the words came out of my mouth, that was my ah hah moment. I'm like, this is what African Americans have to deal with every moment, of every day. It's wondering if they are going to be getting treated differently uh, because of their race. Because of what people perceive, because of the color of their skin, and I felt like an idiot after I said it, because it relates to privilege. Like I never had to think about it before that moment. 

00:16:45
Katherine M. Helm Ph.D. 

00:16:45
DR. HELM Sure, sure, and it's really uncomfortable to think about it, you know. And frequently, when I teach about privilege, I have to acknowledge my own. Which is also very uncomfortable, but also very honest. And I think that your ah, hah moment, my ability to sort of acknowledge my own privileges as well, and people who are members of an oppressed group, we especially don’t like to acknowledge our privilege. Um, you know, but, Dr. Mary Arnold, who used to be here at Governor State you know, said that we all walk in the shoes of the oppressor in the oppressed. You know, and she, that was very accurate. And I think that acknowledging your own privilege allows you to build a genuine connection with the client, and then not be offended because grandma doesn’t like white people. You know, instead you realize that grandma doesn’t like white-ness. She doesn’t know all white people. She doesn’t like white-ness or the sense of privilege that she has been systematically disadvantaged by. And that individuals who have white skin privilege have been advantaged by, you know. 

00:17:40
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D That was a beautiful, wait I want you to pause for a second. That was a beautiful way to say that. It was about white-ness. She didn’t know Shannon Dermer, she knew the white-ness. 

00:17:45
DR. HELM Exactly. 

00:17:45
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D And all the things that went along with that. 

00:17:50
DR. HELM Yes, and some of the automatic privileges of that. Um, and so, I think that, you know, one of the things that I learned, I too, had a past working on an adolescent inpatient unit in a psychiatric hospital, and you know, some of them would be very angry at me. And I used to have to think to myself, you know, I would say to them, you're not angry at me because I just met you, you know, and so, your angry because you are here, or you are angry at the circumstance, and in some ways bonding with them meant, their anger was justified. My acknowledging that your anger is justified. Um, because you are in this inpatient unit you don’t want to be in. Sometimes, I think that non-black clinicians you know, in their bonding with counselors, instead of apologizing for who you are, or kind of being sort of guilty or shameful, you know, it’s just a fact, your white, I'm African American, these things aren’t going to change. But there still can be a genuine connection built when we acknowledge how privilege and racism operates and how it can impact the therapeutic encounter, it's just honest. 

00:18:45
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D I have to say though that of all the things with multiculturalism, I find um, teaching about privilege to be one of the most difficult. And I think, who is it, I think Peggy Macintosh, she talked about unpacking the knapsack, and white privilege, and um it was related to something that you said, people do take it personally, oh, it's like, I did this, instead of, this is related to, um, whatever it is. You know, not being black, or having money or um, being male, or being Christian in the United States, since it’s the majority. That whatever your privilege is, it’s not that you earned it. 

00:19:20
DR. HELM Exactly, it just means you get better treatments. 

00:19:25
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D But students struggle, and clinicians I think struggle with that, cuz of that guilt or feeling like, well I didn’t do that, or I didn’t ask for that privilege, so why do I have to pay for it? 

00:19:35
DR. HELM And I think you know, as a teacher, you know, as you teach, you supervise, I do as well, I usually start with me. And I acknowledge my own privilege, my educational privileges, uh, my standard English privilege, you know people assume I am intelligent, whether or not I am, they just automatically assume- 

00:19:55
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D You are. 

00:19:55
Katherine M. Helm Ph.D. 

00:19:55
DR. HELM It, thanks, but you know people automatically assume it, and I get better treatment if I call up and say I am doctor, which, I don’t, but could. Um, and you know, having unaccented English, now there are certain types of privileges that are more powerful in society than others. Male privilege, etcetera, umm but, you know, when you acknowledge your own privilege, and its deeply uncomfortable to do, um, you know, I think it's easier for students and for counselors in training, you know and the reason why it's important to do this is because, your uh, couple of color that comes in knows it, they look at you, you know, the counselor who is culturally different than them, and know there is a privilege difference there. You know, and in some ways are you know, maybe kind of guarded in saying how can you really understand me? And if you don’t acknowledge that in some ways, you know, it can really damage the connection. I don’t think you have to sort of tell the client, look I know I have all this privilege, that is more about the clinician than the client, but if you don’t do that internal work, it definitely shows up in your clinical work with your clients. 

00:20:55
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Right, which, gets in the way of one of the most important things, which is the relationship. 

00:21:00
DR. HELM Exactly. 

00:21:00
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D And, and it doesn’t feel authentic, it's that you know, we talk about the pink elephant in the room, I know it, you know it, but none of us are talking about it. and that should be the responsibility of the clinician not the client- 

00:21:15
DR. HELM Exactly. 

00:21:15
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D To bring some of that up. 

00:21:15
DR. HELM Exactly. 

00:21:15
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Yeah. And also sometimes not to make it more than it is also. 

00:21:20
DR. HELM Exactly right, because some clients you know, will say, okay, right but I don’t really care cuz I am here, cuz I am hurting, or I'm angry at my spouse, you know and so, I think that just a quick acknowledgment of the differences, may be all that's needed cuz that lays the important groundwork if the client does want to bring it up, it provides a basis for the dialogue to happen. We usually find the clients will not bring it up, unless the clinician does. But to spend too much time on it, you know, again becomes a lecture, um, it's sort of about I'm really here because I'm in pain. 

00:21:55
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Right. Right. So acknowledge it but also don’t emphasize it more than it needs to be. And that's where our assessment skills come in. it’s going to have more of a place in some sessions, and almost no place in others. 

00:22:05
DR. HELM Exactly. 

00:22:05
Shannon Dermer Ph.D. 

00:22:05
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Okay. I, I remember um, a case one time where, and it really does come down to, I think you talked about I say honesty, and genuine-ness. I think you talked about being honest and authentic. Um, that I was working with an African American mother one time, who's some had um, done something, I think he had been speeding, or something and was pulled over by the police. And she was just talking about being really angry at him. But it was like a big reaction. 

00:22:35
DR. HELM Sure. 

00:22:35
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D being angry at him, it seemed more than what was warranted in that situation. And I said, uh, what's that like to be um, the mother of an African American male teenager. And she looked at me and said what are talking about? It's like being the mother of any other teenager. And I said, really? I would think it would be more scary, but you know. And then she paused and she looked at me and she's like, you know what, your right. She's like, I tell my son, you don’t have the privilege of other teenagers. 

00:23:05
DR. HELM Sure. 

00:23:05
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D When you go out there and the police pull you over, your being pulled over at two strikes against you already. Your being African American and being for an African American male. And she was like so I was angry at him. That situation could have escalated way beyond what would, what's called for, for someone speeding. 

00:23:20
DR. HELM Sure. 

00:23:20
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Because he is an African American you know, adolescent man. 

00:23:25
DR. HELM Exactly, and you know and we can look to sort of every day examples of gun violence against unarmed black men today. And so, your ability to recognize that I would sort of label as a very culturally sensitive approach. Whether or not she wanted to talk about it, is something different all together. 

00:23:40
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D But, she knew that she could, at least that’s what I hope, that she could. 

00:23:45
DR. HELM Sure, exactly. 

00:23:45
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D And I know, before we get too much further, I want to bring this up, because I don’t want to forget, that you have a book called, Love, Intimacy and the African American Couple. And I believe in here you discuss about non-black clinicians working with African American couples. Correct? 

00:24:00
DR. HELM Yes. it’s a book chapter uh, by Dr. Kyana Pumphrey and she looks at some practical solutions, strategies, and levels of awareness. 

00:24:10
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Good. Okay. So I mentioned privilege, that I think that’s one of the most difficult things to talk to clinicians and trainees about. What do you see people, non-black um clinicians who are working with African American couples. What do you think they struggle the most with? 

00:24:25
Katherine M. Helm Ph.D. 

00:24:25
DR. HELM I think in general, and I will look to my students, um, so, you know, on the first night or maybe the second night of my multicultural issues in counseling class, I do a role play, and see if, and I play an African American culturally different client, and I have a student who is culturally different than me sit across from me and see how they bring up race. And they all struggle with it, and I let this go on for probably 25 minutes. You know, and they bring up everything else, but race. And so I think that because we are taught to have a color blind approach, which I actually think is disrespectful, because we do see color, like we see gender and height and weight and things like that. Um, I think that in some ways, you know, those of us who trained clinicians have to work against the color blind approach. And so I think that student and clinicians alike, really feel awkward or that its disrespectful to bring up race, and I actually think it’s the opposite of that, I think a very respectful thing to do. And the more you do it the more comfortable you get. And so typically, I will frame, how do you bring this up with your client? Because you want to frame anything that could be a barrier to forming a good relationship with the client. And sometimes, we typically build relationships based on similarity not differences, you know, and sort of, kind of shining a light on some of those differences, in some ways builds credibility for the non-black counselor working with black clinicians. So, learning how to bring up race, but keep it short, right, just so that the client knows you are aware of these differences. 

00:25:50
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:25:50
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Okay, very good. And I find that um, first of all I like that idea of doing a role play, and uh, to help people that will talk around it. and it is a very serious subject, but I also find that sometimes it’s helpful to use a bit of humor. 

00:26:05
DR. HELM Sure. 

00:26:10
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Uh, to help people feel comfortable. And there is actually, a bit by Wanda Sykes, who is, you know, a famous comedian, where she talks about people being color blind, and about the privilege that her white friend has when they are in a grocery store and she takes a bottle of soda or pop, depending on where in the country you are from. And she opens it up and starts drinking it before she gets to the cash register, and talks about that’s part of white privilege, that you can get away with that, where for her she would have immediately felt she would have been arrested, and you know, thrown into jail for doing something like that. But I find that um, humor can be helpful too, do you think that that's okay, or do you think- 

00:26:45
DR. HELM Absolutely, I think that humor, I don’t know if you've noticed, but, you know, um, I'm African American, I think, I think you know, humor is appropriate. You just have to be careful because not everybody shares your sense of humor. 

00:26:55
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D That is very culturally bound. 

00:27:00
DR. HELM Yes. 

00:27:00
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D That’s a good, good point. 

00:27:00
Katherine M. Helm Ph.D. 

00:27:00
DR. HELM So, you know, I think you know, you have to be very careful in doing it, and I also think that you know, race is not a humorous issue. There is a lot of pain behind issues of race. And so, I don’t think we should make it a humorous issue, but I think you can bring it up in a humorous way. But you just have to be very careful about making sure that you know, you do it in a way that you share the clients sense of humor, and you know, I think you can bring it up initially, kind of in the first session, briefly, um, and then later as it comes up, and you get to know the client better, humor might be more appropriate. 

00:27:35
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Good. So, that’s an excellent point. So the more sensitive and probably the more painful a topic is, uh, really the more careful you have to be with humor. And humor is very culturally bound. 

00:27:45
DR. HELM It is. 

00:27:45
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D What some people find funny, other people find incredible offensive. 

00:27:45
DR. HELM Exactly. 

00:27:50
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D So, good, so it's not a funny subject, but sometimes we can approach it with some humor, or be open to other people talking about it with humor. 

00:27:55
DR. HELM Sure. Sure and you know I mean, to that point, I think that every time I talk about in my class, the legacy of slavery, the legacy of slavery, people are like why are we still talking about this! Um, you know, because there is still so much pain behind it. And I think that if you are a non-black clinician you know, it’s easier for you to not be in touch with the pain that’s behind race and to disconnect from that. Um, but I think that, you know, if you are aware of your own privilege, then you are aware of how painful things might be for other people. And so, I really do think that being in touch with that you know, I liken it to this, you know, if you are watching TV and there is some stories that you know, come up on the homeless, or on children who are starving, the first thing we all do is change the channel. Or we justify why we don’t want to give money you know, for the homeless. We have homeless right here in the United States why do we have to support it. But, I do think it's all of our responsibility to take care of one another, and to be culturally aware um, in sort of how we work with our clients.
