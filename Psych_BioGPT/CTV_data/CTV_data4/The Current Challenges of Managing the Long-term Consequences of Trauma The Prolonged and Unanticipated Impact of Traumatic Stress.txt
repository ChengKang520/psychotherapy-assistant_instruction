DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE LIVE: BOSTON SEAPORT WORLD TRADE CENTER 

00:00:00
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Ah, hush has descended over the audience, uhm, for good reason because our next presenter is hush-worthy. Uhm, so I'm glad you-- I'm glad that-- to introduce you. So, ah, Alexander McFarlane is, uhm, a frequent presenter at this conference, even though he lives in Adelaide, Australia. Ah, and the reason that he presents here so frequently he e-- that he's undoubtedly the most brilliant person in the field. Ah, so I hope none of you feels offended by that. I think, ah, as I should mention, used it, such. Ah, he is done-- he, he started his work in the Australian Bushfires, ah, when he was still a very young, barely out of medical school person and what to my mind is the most outstanding issue about Sandy is done unlike really most people in this field they know of. He is a true scientist and that means has he explores what we don't know. Ah, there's a tendency in this field to say, I have found an answer or you should do it this way or this type of treatment is really(ph) something. Sandy is always looking at what are we missing, what do we know but the date really show and by always being curious about the unknown keeps discovering new issues that the rest of us have passed by. And someone that came up when, ah, Australian Government gave him in some complicated way, ah, a contract of study, ah, Australian serviceman who, uhm, ah, joined to the American Armed Forces to invade Iraq and Afgha-- Afghanistan. And studied it before they went to war and after war and go to have a very sorrow look at what more does demand. So there's bond I think he shall be discussing here today among the other things.

Alexander McFarlane, MBBS (Hons), M.D. 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:02:15
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE Look, ah, I can only disappoint you after that introduction so I probably should go home now. Uhm, look I would like to just, ah, begin by actually thanking, ah, Bessel and the (inaudible )for constantly maintaining the standard of this meeting apart from my presentation of course, uhm, ah, because, uhm, I think it's very important for us to think about where this field is now. I think particularly this DSM-V has just comes out. Uhm, and I think, ah, the spirit of inquiry an interest and eagerness to learn is something that is perhaps been lost a little, uhm, in, ah, the progress of time. I mean, dogma starts to intrude. Now, I'll reflect a little bit of this morning. But I would particularly, uhm, like to acknowledge Bessel, uhm, and I think he is a unique person, ah, in this field because of his constant, uhm, eagerness to, uhm, look beyond, ah, what we currently, ah, accept. And it's-- hasn't been an easy ride for him in many ways, uhm, and, ah, I, I think it's wonderful that, uhm, you know, there-- he, he has maintained this meeting and that-- in some ways this meeting is what the (inaudible ) should be, uhm, and it's because, ah, of Bessel's constant willingness to, ah, grow and to question. But that isn't an easy thing to do. Now, Bessel mentioned, ah, and the title would suggest that I was gonna talk more about our studies at the military. Unfortunately, I can't say as much so I would like to because in what I understand that doing studies with the military doesn't sometimes that you say what you know. So, uhm, what I'm gonna be doing is telling you a story and behind my story is a great deal more data. Uhm, ah, and I can't really tell you some of it yet but it will, uhm, come out in, in the passage of time. Uhm, so what I'm gonna re-talk about is this whole issue about managing the long-term consequences of stress. And, uhm, it's not just about my studies in the military that would like to talk about because we've now, uhm, followed up to study, ah, cohorts from childhood with their multiple data points in childhood and look at the trauma histories and the wide influences their adult outcomes, as well as doing longitudinal studies of accident victims. But you know the great privilege for me, uhm, is to done this in a context of the clinical practice because, you know, the thing that the patients always tell me and teach me is really what is the meaning and the significance of the title we're looking at and I think you-- if you're going to be assigned as the young people here, uhm, ah, really should maintain their clinical and research career simultaneously if it's possible, because they constantly feed each other and I think the way that I've survived to the condition, uhm, is because the research gives me a chance to think about what I do, and this is to smartly distance myself from it. Now, I'd like to begin, ah, by talking about the issue of amputation without anesthesia. I mean, you might think this is an unusual place to start, but, you know, one of the great breakthroughs in medicine was the introduction of anesthesia. Now, you know, I mean, how many of you would like to have an operation without an anesthetic? 

00:05:25
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE The denial of trauma by medical professionals "I have read recently with mingled sadness and surprise. The declarations of some surgeons that anesthetics are needless luxuries, and that unendurable agony is the best of tonics. Those surgeons, I think, can scarcely have been patients of their brother surgeons, and jest at scars only because they never felt a wound, but if they remain enemies of anesthetics after what you have written, I despair of convincing them of their utility" 

00:05:30
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE Or would, uhm, like to be a doctor doing any amputation without anesthetic? Because, uhm, this is what used to happen and I'd like to read just briefly from, ah, letter by Doctor George Wilson(ph), who'd had his arm amputated. Uhm, ah, and he wrote a letter in the 1850s to Doctor Simpson(ph) who was the HIMSS(ph) advocate, most of you went to medical school and you would remember Simpson's forceps well, that's name after good Doc. Simpson. But one of his, you know, other great challenges was getting anesthesia and you think that would be pretty straightforward if you invented anesthesia everybody had want it. But if you read the first paragraph of his letter, he, he re-- he write. I have recently read, with mingled sadness and surprise, the declarations of some surgeons that anesthetics are needless luxuries, and that unendurable agony is the best of tonics. Those surgeons, I think, can scarcely have been patients of their brother surgeons, and jest at scars only because they never felt a wound, but if they remain enemies of anesthetics after what you have written, I despair of convincing them of their utility. Now why I do I, why do I start with that? Because, you know, you'd think that when new treatments come into being that clinicians would readily adopt them. You know, I think one of the things we need to ask is, you know-- it's very easy. This looks quite, how many-- could anybody say this-- well, you know, we need to think about whether psychiatry and psychology done the same things and would we might be doing the same things now. Whether we've taken doctrinal(ph) positions, that's more to do with our professional confidence because surgeons thought their expertise are doing quick operations was going to be eroded because they could feel it around in the wound for more than 5 seconds. Uhm, and so they, they really saw it as being a threat to their professionalism. So just to really put the argument as to why we do get things wrong, but equally in a lot of having got things right. I'd like to just talk a little about Freud for a minute. Now, I would thoroughly recommend it and, you know, it's one of those things you much you've lectured about that's you think-- I'm not say it again but, you know, there's always a new generation of people coming forward. Cuz his first lecture that, that he wrote with Breuer(ph) is a wonderful piece of writing. Uhm, and there's a sentence or paragraph in there where he talks about the critical role of trauma and particularly to quite his words more precisely the memory of the trauma acts like a foreign body which long after entry must be continued to be regarded as an agent that is still at work. Now e-- I'm gonna talk a lot about, uhm, the meaning of that of phrase today, but it's fascinating how despite him having said this, how his work lead into-- I guess ver-- a much more, uhm, (inaudible ) theory, ah, about the importance of the first 5 years of life and there's a medical student in the nearly, ah, and then in my psychiatric residency, there was really very little theoretical understanding of how adult stress had such a profound effect on psychopathology the front-- despite for it having written that because of the subsequent dominance to these ideas. And just to reflect on the dominance of their ideas and cause of those ideas, uhm, there's a wonderful chapter in the 1974 textbook by Albert Glass, who wrote the main report in the American Armed Services after the Second World War, where he, he reflect some of the way that knowledge has been used and he talks about and in the period after the First World War, uhm, how really the consequences, uhm, and the morbidity observed was seen to be as a consequence of faulty, faulty personality, then you can see what that does. It absolves people from their responsibility to exposing people to stress, it's not a leadership issue and essentially you bind the individual, yet, of strengths the responsibility. But-- and this is what clinicians accepted that's they adapted that position so how-- and if they could listen to their patients. They weren't listening to where they'd been. Now, the Second World War came along and what happen is that it took a first year, remember all the lessons from, from the First World War but then Gla-- as Glass goes on he says, "Military psychiatry, like civil psychiatry, ignored the lessons of wartime experience. Instead attention was focused in the then prevalent psychoanalytic concepts and practice." So everybody reverted back to the idea that these were people who'd become unwell because of the-- develop-- early developmental experience and faulty personalities. Now, so this just shows how despite knowledge people forget things. And I think we're in danger potentially of doing, ah, the same thing now because those of you who went practicing in 1990, 1990 when DSM-III was released was a very interesting period of time because the word neurosis was removed from the depressive and anxiety disorder and the reason was because essentially, it was atheoretical and it was presume that you cannot any longer use psychoanalytic constructs to label diagnoses. And the reason why they were in there was because the dominance of psychoanalysis as a way, uhm, of thinking now. I think what's happened to DSM-V is that the cognitive behavioral score has come to begin to exert the same dogmatism and limited prism and the criteria in DSM-V in some ways reflect that prism. So it's no longer atheoretical. And I think we need to be careful that we don't go back and start making the stay-- same mistakes again. Now, one of the other things that I've really enjoyed about this conference is the focus on early development attachment. Now, nobody would for one minute-- and, you know, I must say that having declared that I've studied this in, in these, uhm, longitudinal programs we've been looking at. But see, one of the difficulties on focusing dev-- on developmental trauma is that you begin to minimize the impact of adult trauma. And it's very easy to look at all the vulnerability, ali-- arising out of early development. So we gotta be very careful that we don't find simplistic solutions. 

00:11:20
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:11:20
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE We need to take a very broad perspective and that's the part of the story that I really like to focus on today because that is what you actually have to talk to your patients about and you need to take a proper history of. And just to also just to, ah, make a comment about treatment, one of the difficulties about common behavior therapy and EMDR is that any school of therapy is advertised and advocated for by people who essentially have got in them extraordinary conflict of interest and I think it's one of the issues that we don't deal with adequately. We, we talk about the companies having conflict of interest all the time but I think psychotherapist equally have conflicts of interest. And there's been some very interesting meta-analysis done of the treatment and this-- I recommend that you read this one which was published in 2008 because essentially what it did was to be quite selective, ah, about the studies that it looked at in the sense that it any looked at studies where there was an active comparison. And what it really showed was that the, the effect sizes for psychotherapies around active interventions was zero. Okay, now that's not to say that therapies don't work. The issue is the dominance of one therapy over another actually isn't as apparent and we've just revised the Australian guidelines for PTSD and there's prog-- pa-- progressive retreat to the mean, uhm, of, ah, the effect sizes in cognitive behavior therapy. So the early traits(ph) studies which were done by the advocates of the treatment, those effect sizes are no longer being made in time. You know, there are studies now that show that evident(ph) standard treatment, you know, everyday clinical treatment CBT does not give you a better outcome. So we just need to be very careful about not letting dogma really disguise the reality that we need to do a lot more to advance treatment. So I think that's one of the great things about this conference. We've heard about a variety of different pr-- approaches. The problem is there's no one approach that's gonna work. So let's get back to our dear Doctor Wilson(ph). So what was he telling Doctor Simpson(ph) about? 

00:13:20
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:13:20
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE Because, you know, you don't need to be a psychiatrist. This man could tell us the story in his own words. What he talked about here was, uhm, the experience of this, uhm, amputation and he, he says I-- what he underwent I cannot express in words. He understood the disruption of language and the disruption of expression that occurs with his experiences. And then he says the pains are now forgotten but in a sense they weren't because the, the risk that's in-- he talks about the black whirlwind of emotion, the horror of great darkness, the sense of desertion by god and men bordering close upon the spear which swept through my mind and overwhelmed my heart. I can never forget however gladly I would do so. Now, you know, that you don't need to work diagnostic criteria. That tells you the story, that tells you what it is and it tells you about the quality of traumatic memory and that's what we have to hear in our patients. Now you can understand why you don't want to listen, ah, and you can also understand why the surgeons didn't want to listen. Because if you do-- were doing that to people, you must have had some psychological defense against it. And he then goes on and reflects about how that traumatic memory causes illness. He talks about how these memories haunted him and how they resuscitated and that's the whole issue. Traumatic memories, constantly become alive. And then he talked about how he thought-- sort of thought he had forgotten it but very clear we, we can see he hasn't. You know, that this is going in and out of his awareness and he talks about-- like an occasion of suffering of their own and be the cause of a great disquiet which favors neither mental or bodily health. And the thing that-- one of his reminiscence is-- was the constant recurrence of the pain that he experience during the amputation. So it is the sensory experience that captured his mind. So it's really against that background that I'd like to address a series of questions today. Uhm, the first thing is that individuals who cope at the time of stress exposure become unwell many years later. Now that's one of the reasons why people found it so difficult to really understand how soldiers can go to war, fight effectively and then 20 years later become unwell. And how do you explain in fact that was their wartime experience that caused the illness and you can see everywhere(ph) is suggestibility compensation, disability seeking but, uhm, one of the great problems is there hasn't been a moment of psychopathology that I think really explains how acute stress leads to very long term risks of becoming unwell. And I think that's what our field hasn't answered, uhm, and you can see we, we in fact need to focus not only on the vulnerability factors, we need to also focus on the trauma. Now just to get back to this issue in answering that question, how much progress have we made since 1980 when PTSD, you know, really got its legs, uhm, and are we making progress? Now I'm, I'm, I'm just showing you this data just to demonstrate that we're not making progress and we're forgetting, we're constantly forgetting what's come before. 

00:16:20
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:16:20
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE Frank Norris, uhm, in the journal, Traumatic Stress, ah, in 2006 published a study which he reviewed 225 disaster studies and the longer times passed there have been fewer longitudinal studies of representative samples. Early assessment has become increasing so people just look at people for a very short period of time and then to pretend they know about what the long-term consequences are and equally often do this in the absence of knowledge about epidemiology. And just to respe-- reflect that graphically, you can see the blue is cross sectional studies and you can see she's broken it up into time periods and the re-- red is longitudinal studies and you can see the number of cross sectional studies are going up and the longitudinal studies are going down and the quality of the research is decreasing and the numbers, the numbers in the cohorts are going down. And, you know, the trouble is when you go to PubMed, what you do is you get the papers that are being published in the first 3 years. People forget about these previous studies so we have to be very careful you see. Don't just read what's been published in the last couple of years because you might actually be reading essentially degraded knowledge. Uhm, and I think really that, I think highlights how the long term course actually isn't adequately considered and it's much harder to follow people for a long time and, and this whole question about what can face, uhm, the long-term risk. So the theme of my talk and really is, is about the importance of the longitudinal course and about the changes in reactivity that people have over their lifespan as a consequence of trauma risk exposure. And what I'm gonna be talking about is both the evidence for that and also the neurobiological mechanisms and why this is a critical issue to address in treatment. Now with my collaborators that are listed in the bottom in a, uhm, ah, study that we've been doing now for with-- that's 8 years down a track of this cohort. We've interview these people the first week after accidents, 3 weeks, ah, ah, sorry, 3 months, 12 months, 24 months and 16 months. Uhm, and, ah, I'm gonna repeatedly be coming back to this cohort because we've managed to keep, ah, in contact with the significant percentage of them. And what I'm first of all gonna emphasize is the way the if you take an acute look at people you get the wrong picture. Because one of the things that we know is that people who are acutely symptomatic, in other words, they've gotten acute stress disorder, if you look at them 12 months later, they've got a 45% chance of having PTSD whereas if you haven't got an acute stress disorder, you've only got about a 6% chance of having PTSD. Now that would make you think, well, acute stress disorder is really the big risk factor for PTSD. People's acute symptoms is really a thing that tells you about risk but the fascinating thing is if you in fact look at 12 months, how many people have got post-traumatic stress disorder, 70% of them in fact were the people who didn't have an acute stress disorder. And now you can see in the military what people always see is the people get-- who get any acute stress disorders and I think that's what leads to post traumatic stress disorder. But you can see you're actually missing the vast majority of people and you can see that research that looks on the acute effects and has theories around the acute effects is actually is really missing the argument and the reasons why the long term effects of stress in the absence of acute symptoms or the relative absence of acute symptoms is really we need-- really we need to be looking. So just to summarize that, individuals who develop acute stress disorder ha-- have a greater risk of chronic PTSD but in fact IST(ph) is not a necessary (inaudible ) for PTSD and the majority of individuals with PTSD did not have an acute stress disorder. Now the other important issue that an acute stress disorder as a risk factor for other disorders other than PTSD. So people who have come on well acutely, we need to worry about 'em but again you can see why any acute intervention like the whole debriefing movement or, you know, these community programs that are put in place after something like the Boston marathon. Well, it looked like it might be a good idea but in fact most of the people had become unwell. Actually, you're gonna look pretty, ah, asymptomatic and this really gets to the whole issue of delayed onset PTSD. Now people used to say this didn't exist because they weren't longitudinal studies. They said it was people just forgetting that they've been unwell early in th-- in the phase. Ah, and the other problem is that clinicians are used to seeing people who are-- well, if you're working in oncology ward, you think that people with cancer have a terrible prognosis whereas in fact if you look at epidemiological samples, you find a different story. So we as clinicians need to be very careful about what we extract, so when we got to 24 months of this cohort(ph) 96 of them had PTSD. So we're actually then go-- I would go back and look at what then look like it's 3 months and what then look like a year. And the fascinating thing was that in 3 months, only a third of them roughly had a full diagnosis of anything and 44% of them had minimal symptoms even 3 months after the accident. By the time you get to 24 months only 50% of them, only half of them had a full diagnosis and still, you know, around the quarter of them had minimal symptoms. Now, how-- you see the real challenge is how do you explain this? What is your, what is your, you know-- I, I-- if I ask you to write down at this moment in my talk how do you explain that? What's your theory of psychopathology that explains it? What are you gonna do? What are you gonna say to me? You need to ask yourself that question. You see it's a, it's a difficult problem, so don't run away from it. Uhm, and, and the whole issue you see, focusing on acute coping with trauma doesn't actually tell you the answer because majority of this people are coping, they're doing fine acutely. So focusing on the immediate effects and, you know, much of our recent (inaudible ) theory has come from looking at acute responses to trauma. The important thing is that the majority people that come unwell do fine. So don't just have a model that looks at that. Now we've followed these people, ah, as I said 60 months down the trail. On the left hand side you've got an, an-- I'm pointing for couple of friends who are-- spoke that there no, ah, I was telling my jokes, ah, the, the-- that's why they're laughing. Uhm, and time is along the bottom and you can see that you, you-- and one of the beautiful things about, ah, latent growth modeling is you actually separate. If you look at the, the, you know-- if you just look to the symptoms across the population they don't go, they don't go anyway. So the really interesting thing is to look at to some groups. Now the most common pattern is the delayed onset which is the green line which is progressively going up. Uhm, and then the, ah, the-- and if you add that together with the, the group who become increasingly unwell in the first 2 years and then a bit better, uhm, ah, ah, down the track, uhm, you can see that's, uhm, in fact the delayed onset pattern is the most common pattern. it's not the people acutely unwell. The delayed onset pattern is the most common pattern, so that's why we have to address this in a model of psychopathology and you can th-- the other thing you can see is that 72% of these population never had any symptoms. And interestingly, they weren't list of really injured. So the severity of the trauma isn't what differentiates people. So when people say, being distressed acutely is normal, that is not true, okay? And we as psychologist and psychiatrist think that it's true-- it's not true. The majority of people can-- have somebody cured in the seat in the car next to them and a week later they haven't got any symptoms, they're sleeping okay and they get along fine. You know, we might think we'll get another job but that's not sort of a, uhm, ah, you know, discourage adaptation. The other interesting thing is if you look at people who are unwell at 12 months and look at their symptoms severity and this is a study by (inaudible ) studied the one we've been doing. You can actually see that even the people who are unwell acutely, ah, ah, over the 12 months, their symptom severity increases, so even in the group who are unwell their symptoms are getting worst with time. Okay. (inaudible ), how do you explain that? What's going on? You know, and the gro-- and, again, same, same observation, you got this group of people who had got nothing wrong with and that's the majority of people, no symptoms, zero, doing fine. What about military samples? Well, there's a fantastic study in the America called the Millennium Cohort Study, did people know about the Millennium Cohort Study? This is involved recruiting a hundred thousand members of the U.S. Forces to that planning for over at least 2 decades, and they click and died on every 3 years. Now, I would to extract out of that study a group who that click-- that died on prior deployment and two points after the appointment. And what essentially they were able to say-- show is, in fact the most common pattern of symptomatic distress is this group of people who, uhm, have some symptoms following their deployment but they get worse with time. Okay, so that is the most common pattern that's 6.7% as against to 2% of people who've got acute symptoms when they get back but the interesting thing is that the people who, who run well before they went, you say. So the people get acute stress disorders, might be the people who were unwell on the day that the accident happened. 

00:25:10
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE Millennium Cohort Study Pre/Post Deployment Samples • 3393 with single deployment • 4392 with multiple deployment • Predeployment and 3 year follow up • Latent growth mixture modeling 

00:25:10
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE And there are other things you could see-- other 3% of these soldiers are doing fine, nothing wrong with them. And again we must address wh-- what differentiates them. Some people get better on deployment. It's interesting, isn't it? You know, but how do you explain that? You know, it might be they're getting away from their families, you know, done it like the wife(ph), you know, done to deal with the screaming kids, you know being shut at is much easy than dealing with those day to day, those day to day issues. So, you know, let's, let's, uhm,-- and there was, a, a, a very interesting meta-analysis done in 2009. We're looking at this whole issue of delayed-onset post-traumatic stress disorder and the fascinating thing is when I looked at the issue of the studies, the main duration of follow up was 12 months, so you got to remember we follow this population throughout years now. So you can see how you're gonna miss the evidence if you just look at people for 12 months. Even when you look at 12 months, a quarter people got delayed-onset PTSD. So the longer you go out, the more people are going to fall at that bracket. And it's particularly common amongst those who've had combat exposure and some (inaudible ), ah, PTSD is risk factors. So I look, you know, that, that, that charge you how in one sense, the database from which were working is still very limited. So once we're getting these longitudinal databases, we need to concentrate on them because the guidance clinicians you see, I think the great opportunity is to identify these low grade symptoms and intervene, this is before the growth stage regulations have happened. And how w-- how might we do that? So just to come back, you can see, hopefully I've now presented a little evidence to support the first point that I'm making that individuals who've coped at that time a stress exposure may become unwell many years later. Okay. So we need to now addressed this issue about or how do you explain it. Now the interesting thing is you don't need to be scientist sometimes to explain things. This is a man who, uhm, he's, he's gotta, ah, an award which is the equivalent of the knighthood in Australia. He was the general who led one of our task forces to Afghanistan, uhm, and since leaving the military, he's written a book and, and being of strong advocate for the dealing with the serviceman. Cuz he himself has got post-traumatic stress disorder. Then he did a television interview whilst in Afghanistan in 2010 before he declared what was wrong with him. And he's a very articulate man and this is a direct quote, this is how he was able to speak to a television camera. He said, we cannot underestimate the damage we might be doing to our people through constant stress. We must do everything we can to help them out psychologically, with medical care, with everything. These people are putting their lives on the line, they do this without question. They don't flinch and when they're hurt, when they're hurting as they will down the years, we've got to keep stepping up as a society and look after them. So, you know, I think we, we have this obligation you see, not to just think when they come back that they are looking at okay, that we don't worry about them. And this is not just about what we're doing in the consulting room, it's about the systems of care and it's also about how we follow these people and that's why research is so important, you see-- because it's part of this advocacy. But, you know, the great thing is we have people like these men who was willing to really point out the, uhm, ah, at some personal cost, he's on suffering, but he has also have been able to do before then. You know, the important thing you see about these soldiers when they come back is traumatic memories and what I wanna talk about is the importance of traumatic memories not just the PTSD but to all psychopathology. And in one sense that's one of the great—Freud didn't just talk about traumatic neurosis, he said that this theory was relevant to everything. Now DSM-V has made a mistake of putting PTSD into a stress related disorder category but not depression, not generalized things other disorder and I think that's fundamentally not consistent with the evidence, you know. You see, this is what we are beginning not to get it right with DSM-V. So just to talk a little around the study we are followed up this cohort of 1500 kids, half of them controls and we've now followed them up twice in adulthood 21 years after the fire and 21 years-- ah, 28 years later. Now the first thing that's been very interesting comparing the control upon the a bush fire(ph) population is just the prevalence of trauma. Now Australia is, ah, I think a pretty nice place but it's-- if we don't ask people about the bad things that happen to them, you don't see it and that's one of the great lessons that epidemiologists taught us, that in fact most clinicians do not ask proper trauma histories. And one of the reasons PTSD is now the most common condition in the Australian communities not because it becomes more prevalent. It's because people now ask people very specifically, what are the traumatic exposures you've had and then ask specifically about whether if you've had symptoms after them. And, you know, the rights of PTSD from the first epidemiological study in 1990 until now have gone up nine fold. It's not that PTSD is more common, it's because people don't know how to ask the questions. And that's one of the things clinically that you must always do, don't just say have you had any traumatic experiences cuz people don't tell it. You've actually got to go through a whole list. And the average number of, uhm, traumas that satisfy the (inaudible ) here in, in our population at the age roughly around 25 to 35 was full. Okay. So there's not experiences outside the range of normal human experience as with (inaudible ) DSM-III-R. So what I really wanna do is to look at this question about, what is the relationship between traumatic, uhm, memory in adult disorder? Well, the thing that absolutely astounded me was that when we look to the population we interviewed using the co-- CIDI, was in fact 63% of them meet the B-criteria for PTSD. Where only 12% of them had (inaudible ) history of PTSD, it's amazing. So, you know, and, and look at you, you represented the general population. Probably about two-thirds of you have actually got a traumatic memory that satisfies the B-criteria which is extraordinary when you think about it, isn't it? Now, what are the risk that suits with that? Because it's not just-- see, one of problems as we saw off and ask about trauma exposure and miss what Freud's said was the critical intervening link and that's why don't ask people their trauma history line, ask them about whether they have memories from it. Because here, what we were able to do was to remove all the people with disorder prior to their trauma exposure. And then looked at the risk of developing depression if you meet the B-criteria. And you can see the odds ratio is, you know, you've got roughly 479% greater chance of having depression of you've got traumatic memories. And if you look at the numbers, you can see how few of the people who didn't meet the criteria of people were-- the, the, the, B-criteria were depressed. I mean the people who've got the intrusions are the ones who get depressed, you know. Doesn't this mean this is a post-traumatic disorder, you know. We then follow these people again as I said up 8 years later, and we account-- we removed all the people who were depressed in that analysis and still the continued presence of traumatic memories conveys a significant risk of on-going depression, ah, new onset depression. Now with anxiety disorders, the effect is slightly less but again you can see how 52 of those with an anxiety disorder had met the B criteria as against 10 who didn't meet the B-criteria. The interesting issue is that when we follow them up, uhm, 8 years later that effect had washed-out so in fact the effects of anxiety where the carrier-- anxiety disorder was the carrier. The traumatic memory is still there but they weren't accounted for new-- onset of new disorder, so it's depression that particularly appears to be a post-traumatic condition-- depression, not PTSD. Depression. Oh, I'll said it again, depression, you know. You know, if I said that in a, in a, in a affective disorder conference is that I'll get lynched in the corridor, they'll say stop trying to take over our field, you know, we've kept you in the stress disorder category, you know. Why don't we treat people who've got depression about the traumatic memory strategies? So, you know, I hope I've put the argument to you about how traumatic memory conveys this risk. 

00:33:10
Presence of ANY Intrusive Symptoms (B criteria) DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:33:10
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE And, uhm, if we look at the-- getting back to that accent's population would have been the following for, for, for 7 years. How many of the people with the different diagnosis satisfy the B criteria? And you can see generally oddly it's around 40% of them, satisfy the B criteria. Now that never gets addressed in standard treatment, never and it should because we know from our field how important those traumatic memories are, driving that psychopathology. So, you know, if you have somebody who hasn't got PTSD don't think they shouldn't be seeing you if you're a PTSD expert because, uhm, we can see the, the importance of this memory. So to summarize the prevalence of traumatic exposure is underestimated, traumatic memories are found more prevalent than PTSD, traumatic preoccupation and orientation remains but this link is not recognized by this clinicians. And there's the constant risk of further reactivation, you see. And that's what I'm gonna be talking a little more about as a mark of general risk for psychopathology. And if you have a clinical problems it's just not there. I mean, that's been done in the of number studies. I mean, the-- these histories are just not there so the point is that people died here, they don't hear what patients are telling them. You know, we keep thinking it's amazing, kept (inaudible ) 1975 so the prevalence of incest was one in a million whilst at the registrar I had seen about 20 people that had been a victim of incest. What, what were the clinicians doing? How did the editors let that be written down? Now the point is we still won't be making that sort of mistakes today. So don't just think, you know, but these really are old fools like me, you know, that they-- we know now. Well, yeah, maybe we don't. 

00:34:45
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:34:50
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE So F-- Freud, you see he really did get it but he then made the mistake, he got it wrong. He didn't believe that this really could have been sexual abuse. So one of the difficulties about our field is really acknowledging the reality of human experience. As T.S. Elliot said, "Human ki-- kind cannot tolerate too much reality." And that's one of the difficulties about working this field. Clinicians find all sorts of ways of not listening as do those surgeons whenever doing the amputations without anesthetic. So we, we, we can get caught up in this world. Now, it comes back to this whole question, you see about, well, you know, we think PTSD's history. What is the most common post-traumatic dis--, ah, ah, disorder? Now I've looked at these in a number of populations but I'll just refer to you again, ah, to the, the injury vulnerability sample because if we look at 12 months, you can see 31% of the population had a disorder, 22% had a new disorder. You've got to remember that when people have bad things happened and often, you know, (inaudible ) so we've always gotta take the amount of the sample when we try to work out what causes PTSD. Sixty-nine percent of those who de-- had the disorder didn't have PTSD by the people who developed disorder after the accident. So in fact, you can see PTSD actually only accounts for about 30% of post-traumatic pathology. And what's the most common disorder? No, it's not PTSD. 

00:36:05
UNKNOWN Depression. 

00:36:05
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE It's depression. It's depression. Okay. Now you look OCD in here as well, (inaudible ) social phobia, okay. So you can see-- I just wanna take-- I mean, I was gonna say we gonna-- we wanna takeover the world but, but, you know, the-- but the problem is this is really important and people just don't use the evidence. So I mean, if you're gonna have a theory of schizophrenia, you need to take this into account, because you can see one of the other things as many of these people got multiple disorders and one of things we have a theory about what's the cause of PTSD, what's the theory about the cause of depression, what's the theo-- te, ah, you know, the theory about the cause of the etiology of special-- social of 5-year. But the real issue is that in fact most disorders have shared mechanisms of disorder. So the really interesting question you say, is what differentiates somebody? Why does someone-- person go down the path of depression as against PTSD? Well, now we've all got traumatic memories, you see-- wha-- wha-- what is it? So I think one of the really important question is to try and look at this issue about what is the shared core of pathology. And there's a great, ah, meta-analysis that was published in American Journal of Psychiatry in 2007 that brought together the fear paradigm in your imaging studies and it compared PTSD, social phobia, simple phobia and f-- and, and, and just basic fear in normal individuals. 

00:37:25
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE Anatomical Areas Involved in Fear Insular Cingulate cortex Ventromedial prefrontal cortex Sensory thalamus AMYGDALA FEAR RESPONSE 

00:37:30
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE Now what I'd like you to do is to think about, what do you think are the areas of activation in the brain that are gonna be different in those different disorders and what's gonna be common? Okay, because, you know, what-­- how is PTSD different from these early disorders? And if you got to treat people you see, you need to think about the difference. Now, the areas that came up as being of relevance with the sensory thalamus, the insular, cingulate cortex, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala. You've got to remember this is only one paradigm, this is, this is only way of looking at the brain. It's for provoking fear in people. And essentially that's a, a diagram that schematically looks at the interconnections between, uhm, the, the different regions, you know, we got the amygdala and insular and thalamus and the regions in the prefrontal cortex. And the next slide in a sense demonstrates all the regions with-- if all these groups were different from the controlled population. But the fascinating thing is the green which is specific phobia and social phobia is the blue and PTSD is the, the reddy color. I'm colorblind so I don't if I, I put colors wrong. But the fascinating thing here as you can think-- see that the, uhm, the amygdala and the insular are more active. 

00:38:45
Comparison of Regions Medial prefrontal cortex DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:38:45
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE Now the PTSD, people still of-- ha-- have got excessive activation of those regions but no to the same degree as occurred in these other two phobic conditions, so don't think that PTSD is just about the insular of the amygdala, you see. The really important issue is that all the red bars across the front, around the thalamus. Now when do we talk about the thalamus with PTSD treatments? I mean it's very important if we think about neurofeedback as a treatment, uhm, but you can see it's really this frontal regions that are disrupted in PTSD. Now you see, that's important. Now that's actually probably something that she is with depression, you see. This disruption, those prefrontal circuitry and if you look at this side, here you can see PTSD is on the left, fear is on the right, social phobia speci-- ah, uhm, ah and social anxiety and specific phobia. We can see the blue areas, ah, all in--which are the ones who have hyperactivation in the PTSD sample are always regions. So we've got to think about the frontal cortex and what that contributes to psychopathology if we're gonna see what is different about PTSD, possibly from other anxiety disorder. So we can equally argue that the amygdala was a critical thing for PTSD cuz it's, you know, look at-- you can't get through the life without the amygdala. I mean, you can't be unwell if you have-- got a problem with the amygdala. So the critical issue here is fear avoidance of trigger career(ph) is a common feature of these disorders but it's the increased activation in the amygdala and insula is greater in non-PTSD disorders. And in fact the interesting thing is that is the same pattern that is get ac-- activation that you see in healthy subjects who are getting anticipatory an-- anxiety during fear conditioning, you know. What's different about PTSD? It's disruption of its frontal networks. 

00:40:25
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:40:25
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE Disruption of the frontal networks, that is what you need to think about. So I-- I'm just schematically trying to highlight, you know, it, it lies, uhm, in five areas. These are the ones that really tell us what's different as against similar. So PTSD then, just to summarize this, is a more complex disorder, uhm, when three-- ah, when reactivity threat paradigm as mission. It's more attributed to dysfunction of the reflexive, emotional regulatory systems. And so really it's a deficit of reflective-- ah, re-- reflexive emotional regulation. You can see that's different from being a disorder or arousal, it's not just arousal, it's actually about the way you manage and modulate arousal. Now, where does this come from? And that's what I like to get on to now. But just to su-- summarize that point, you can see that when we come up with theories of psychopathology we, we me-- we're looking at PTSD, don't presume that this is a specific effect of PTSD. It might share a lot of what we are looking at with other conditions. So just to continue down this pathway about trying to understand how this might come about, just a matter of number, ah, the, the, the number of prior traumatic exposures matter. Now the really important issue that-- with this one word I'd like you to take away from this talk it's sensitization, sensitization and-- cuz I think this is the core underpinning of the psychopathology of PTSD and the point is this, something we need to think about how we might better managing treatment, now I think we've had some great talks about mindfulness which I think is one way of modulating people's reactivity. But it's only one part of the story, you know. I think, uhm, ah, neurofeedback is another great way of motor-- modifying (inaudible ) circuitry, but again it's only one part of the story. But let's, let's go through the evidence. 

00:42:15
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:42:15
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE So the really interesting question here as you see, do we become hardened and resilient? Or does the risk increase of disorder with increasing and repeated trauma exposure? Now, you know, look, to be honest, resilience be fantastic if it existed but I think it's just, it's just a way of blaming individuals if they become unwell, you know. I think we've got to be extreme and it's a cult, you know, and the idea that we can really do something is, you know, that a lot of people make lots of money out of it, uhm, and advo-- advocating for it. But look, you know, the evidence is still extremely thin. Uhm-- you know, in a fa-- bushfire sample this-- the, the colors reflect the bushfire group, the control group and the total sample and you can see the probability getting PTSD goes up every time you have another trauma. So if you had already one trauma, you've may go to a, a 6% chance getting PTSD, if you've previously had four or more, you've got a 15% chance of getting PTSD. Okay, so again you see the single instant model doesn't work. The people who get unwell after first trauma exposure probably a little bit different from the ones who've had multiple trauma exposures. 

00:43:20
PTSD and multiple trauma exposure 

00:43:25
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE And the study we did of the entire Australian military, I mean, we, we, we, we had, uhm, died on about 30,000 people which we undergo about 50% response right. But the really important thing here is, we have enough numbers to begin to look at one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 or more trauma experiences. And what you can see here, this is using the part of the PCL and we're looking at low, moderate, high and very high (inaudible ). And what you can see is the more times you get traumatize, you moved from low to moderate to high to very high. Now, this I think is one of the good things about DSM-V, it's talking about a dimensional approach. And you can see this absolutely argues for why the dimensional approach is important because you can see it's-- if you could get people when they were in the green band rather than in the red band, you probably gonna be much-- they're gonna be much easier to treat and that's what we need to be thinking about treatment developments. Uhm, and I think we've been too caught up about whether somebody does or doesn't have a PTSD because it-- it's not as simple as that. You know, these are the people who are in 20 years time that might become unwell. So the evidences is that the ability to process traumatic experience decreases with repeated exposure and the in-- with that impact of different traumatic events is not independent from each other. And there's a need to consider the impact of multiple trauma exposures and therapy. Now again, what, what treatment for it does done properly? You know, CBT does not work nearly as well, in multiple traumatized people and it's not surprising. And again, you know, this is where we, we needed to be sort of thinking with future developments, uhm. Now, my view is that we should be calling this post-traumatic sensitization disorder because it's not that people become acutely unwell after being post-traumatic stress disorder. It's, it's about how the reactivity of the environment changes and it's modified with time. Uhm, so-- and that's not-- I'm not the first person who have suggested that, I mean, I think Louie Crook(ph), uhm, a, a French psychiatrist, who was an ordinary psychiatrist advocated for those ideas. So just to get back to the organizing principle behind this as just the importance of traumatic memories and why you need to be thinking about it constantly with your patients. It's because traumatic memories indicate an information at work which dominants reactivity to environment. Just think about Doctor Wilson(ph) and how it's-- that, that's thoughts were so often resuscitated. Freud's(ph) spoke of patients suffering from reminiscences. So as reminiscences, you know, look at 66% of our population after bush fires have these reminiscences and this is a marker for risk of general disruption for arousal and affect sist-- and regulation. Okay, so let's talk about the process of sensitization. Uhm, and the importance here is that, you know, we've talked a lot of-- at this conference around childhood trauma. Now, don't think that if you get through childhood, you're safe. And one of the things that we have done in these samples is to actually look at people who have lots of childhood trauma as against, little childhood trauma, adult trauma. And I thought there will be a lot of difference in things like dissociation, etcetera. No. 

00:46:40
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:46:40
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE The evidence doesn't show them. So bad things in adulthood are just as bad for you as bad things in childhood. They have different developmental and personality consequences, but, you know, you don't get used to it. So one of the critical things to think about here is that the adaptive response of distress. You know, it's normal for activation of biological systems but they return it in baseline if you, if you're reacting appropriately. We need our stress systems, it's this recru-- ah, recrudescence and establishment of homeostasis. So what is sensitization? Sensitization is where this increasing generalization of reactivity to triggers, so it's not just the intersection that where you had the car accident, it's when you see the color red because that was the killer-- color of the car that hit you. It's the increasing amplitude of the reaction of the arousal cascade. So an advocate, one Vietnam veteran who I sent for MRI-- now, ha-- how many of you had an MRI? Okay. What would that remark-- how would you associate that with combat? Well, in fact it was the sound of rotation reminding you'd been evacuated in the helicopter. Now his pulse stayed up for hundre-- you know, at 120 for 2 days after an MRI. Uhm, so you can see that, you know-- what you can see is that the amplitude of his reactivity and the forth point there is the prolonged maintenance of that arousal. So that's what goes wrong with sensitization and that's what we need to be asking in tracking in our patients and that's what we need to be thinking about how we consider with treatments. And you can see the threshold for activation goes down and so if we're thinking about a sensitized response to stress or the amplitude of that reaction is greater and then it doesn't sound(ph), so we can re--, you know, re-- we can measure this, we can reflect it schematically. And the other thing is that when you have repeated, uhm, exposures that in fact the systems-- your, your systems don't become used to it, if anything the amplitudes or reaction go up and you, you return even less to the original baseline than you did before. Now, you know, the point of which this becomes an illness is an issue which courts were always ask you and, uhm, your health insurance will ask you but you can see a scientist that distracts us and us clinicians about prevention, you know. We need to be looking at people before they really formed to these neat little boxes that we think at the (inaudible ). Now there's an immense scientific literature around sensitization in animal model with multiple systems. 

00:49:05
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:49:05
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE Now we've looked at a number these systems, you know, troops and again I wish I could tell you more information about it but I would risk all sorts of things if I told you. But I will tell you a little bit of the dialogue. So just read between the lines. Uhm, you know, we measured, ah, a series of ERP paradigms, ah, QEG, sterile response inflammatory side, you know, psychiatric disorders influ-- disorders of information. These disorders of information as evidence if you get people non-steriodal and inflammatory agents, if you got schizophrenia, it improves their treatment outcomes. You know, we've found that if you've got herpes viruses, we-- many of us got herpes viruses, you know, cuz we've had, uhm, ah, cold sores or, uhm, chicken pox, you're more likely to get PTSD. Okay. And that's because they've maintain low grade information in your brain. Okay, so what's the I'd-- li-- I'd like to focus on one system and that's the system of sensitization in working memory networks because, you know, as I show-- these frontal networks before are so important in PTSD. So let's just focus on that from a neuroimaging perspective. 

00:50:10
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE Break down in cortical timing in PTSD 

00:50:10
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE You know, this is a start of frequently years in studies, it's, uhm, a paper where we looked at the, uhm, regions that are involved in a working memory task and it was basically the dorsal, lateral prefrontal cortex and the left and right, this language(ph) base task, uhm, and the left and right, uhm, hemisphere and, and the, uhm, parietal regions. And then what we did was to look at the, uhm-- on the left-hand side you can see the, ah, ERP patterns which were essentially looking at the time phase of processing. Now the important thing is to focus down here because the first thing as you noticed, you've got the loss of these nice peaks, so the efficiency of processing is being disrupted in PTSD. Uhm, but equally you've got this desynchronization of those brain regions. Now, so this is really something I've been studying since, uhm, my first paper was published in 1990. Uhm, so what is working memory? And, you know, we, we, we often sort of get just stuck on concept on short-term and long-term memory but really working memory, uhm, is about the way you hold an epoch of about 8 seconds, you know, in your wind(ph). So, I mean, if I'm gonna walk down those stairs, you know, there's actually a delay in my awareness of where I'm going. It takes about 300 milliseconds to be aware of where you are. I'm actually aware of what happened 300 milliseconds ago, as I'm speaking, so you can see, I've got to constantly leap frog myself so actually living-- I'm living in a sausage in time, I'm not looking at a slide, you know. And so this is what we're measuring, the ability to hold, integrate and manipulate representations, uhm, and this is what goes wrong in PTSD. Now in these trips that we've, we've studied these are guys who obviously are healthy because they've been deployed and we've taken symptomatic measures. They don't report symptoms generally or some symptoms but kind of low levels. Uhm, and what we have been very interested is the QEGs and I present the data of that and I'll just reflect on that, ah, at the IST assess-- got me in all sorts of trouble. Uhm, and we're looking for the evidence of sensitization. Now, so this is of schematic diagram which demonstrates the frontal networks you can see the representation of the head, you can see the nose at the front, uhm, and, ah, and the fascinating thing is you get down regulation of the frontal networks with combat exposures. This, ah-- and what you get is up regulation of the sensory and parietal regions. So this is not with people with PTSD, we're not talking what goes wrong in PTSD and you can see the wonderful opportunity we have here. These are people we know from studies that have been done with U.S. Marines. The people's working memory capacity goes down with deployment in the absence of PTSD, in the absence of head injury. And what we are looking at now is the underlying neural mechanisms is because these frontal networks which I've shown are so important in hardly trained combat individuals are being degraded, simply by stress exposure. And what they are then doing is living much more in a-- in an environment of central(ph) activation. Now, that's sounds like sensi-- sensitization to me. So, uhm, essentially we've got down regulation of these frontal networks, we've got loss of sensory (inaudible ) in, in the sensory cortex and we've got these posterior networks, uhm, which was associated with symptom development. And this is the platform in which sensitization occurs. These are guys who are going back again and again and again, ah, and we can show the more times you go, the worse these problems are. So what is the evidence for sensitization fear circuitry cuz you gotta remember I'm-- they're talking about working me-- memory networks. We also saw that these fear networks from that previous meta-analysis are equally important, so let's have a look. The Dutch have done some fantastic studies, Erik Flemington(ph) and his team have done some fantastic studies in this domain and essentially what they adopted is soldiers' preface without PTSD. And what they found is that first combat there's a group of people who have significantly increased reactivity of the amygdala and the insula to fearful faces, that paradigm is showing people fearful faces and looking at what degree of activation happens. And what's happening is in these people, these fear networks of the insula of change does a consequences of deployment are getting greater activations. The interesting thing is that actually goes away with time. So if I don't get redeployed and then I don't get re-traumatized, it will reset itself. And this is essentially just showing, uhm, those, those regions, uhm, of the amygdala and ins-- insula and you can see down here in the row, so here we've got the amygdala here. Okay. So, you know, what we've got here, is we've got evidence of this graph, you see that we've got greater amplitude or reactivity but we can actually show that as you follow them with time that settles. 

00:54:50
Sensitized response to stressor DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:54:50
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE But again you can see, what an opportunity. If we could get that settled more quickly, that ha-- would have a particular effect. And I've been trying to look at this with neurofeedback, uhm, and whether it's working or not is slightly unclear. Phillips(ph) have actually developed a headphone set where they can do your fee-- feedback, uhm, uhm, through this, ah, technology. Now the one thing in the same cohort they found however, was when they followed them up longer, ah, and, uhm, that these areas in amygdala and the insula settled down it's a pattern of abnormal activation of the brain sem-- settled down. But what didn't settled down was decreased natural prefrontal activation. And that remained one-- 1 and a half years later. And you can see that-- that's this green area here, particularly the left dorsal, right prefro-- prefrontal cortex, that is the area that we've found has a problem in PTSD. So you can see some things get better with time, but some things don't get better with time. 

00:55:45
Area of decreased lateral prefrontal activization remain 1.5 years after combat DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:55:45
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE And one of the things we really need to be worrying about is this frontal networks and how we might address that in treatment. So you can see there's very good evidence that what we're getting is this change reactivity, this inability of some systems to return to their baseline and being more sensitive to reactivity with time. So there is evidence of long-term disruption of the lateral prefrontal cortical activation is relevant to working memory, and short-term evidence of sensitization of the amygdala and ins-- insula circuitry that is shared with anxiety disorders. Okay. 

00:56:20
UNKNOWN What does it mean clinically? 

00:56:20
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE What that means clinically is these people lose the ability to monitor and regulate and to hold composite-- complex pictures of the environment, uhm, in their mind and you can imagine how important that is to the negotiation of relationships, to managing affect, to thinking problem solving and people often are very unaware of it, what they might complain over some difficulties with concentration, but if the very symptom-- the very system that you require to monitor yourself is being disrupted. So it's how to des-- explain what's going on, you know, we can't speak of what we don't know. And the-- those very systems are what are being disrupted and you can see if you're gonna engage in psychotherapies, that's the very system we require and that's why you have to address this, if you're gonna manage treatment. It's not simple enough just to talk the people and dealing with the model that essentially focus-- focuses on those fear systems cuz you can see those fear systems were relevant but they're by no means the whole story. 

00:57:20
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

00:57:25
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE So you can see the real issue here is about domino effect on interconnected biological systems where essentially they start to over compensate initially where this, you know, the breaks get put on but then it comes to a point where this adaption collapses and that's when you become unwell. And this, this-- there's very good research around here, this has to do with the dendritic remodeling suppression and neurogenesis structural hypertrophy and atrophy. You know, in people with PTSD have decreased frame brain vo-- internal brain volume, you know, it-- it's a bit lack-- and you-- you're more likely to get dimension if you get PTSD, mo-- more likely to get dimension and it's to do with the information amongst other things. And just to go back to the point you see, I've given you one example about the sensitization of working memory. Now you can see that behind that lies multiple other systems where the evidence points to exactly the same sort of shifts, you know, one of the other things we've heard about, uhm, ah, is parasympathetic system when it was talking about an-- the he, he-- her presentation. And why that might be so important? Because that loss of regulation have very basic capacity to settle and to withdraw is being disrupted. So what are the predictors of PTSD? It's the increased sensitization due to prior trauma exposure, it's the increasing physiological load because you can imagine once you start to become sensitized, you know, we have this adaptation system so the brakes go on, it's like driving a car. You can drive a car with your foot on, ah, on the accelerator but you can equally got 60 kilometers an hour with one foot on the brake and one foot on the accelerator, but the whole thing wears out quicker and that's the model I used with patients. I say to them, look, you know, you're like somebody who's driving along with a car, ah, with a foot on the brake and a foot on the accelerator. When you come to a hill, you can't get up there as quickly. So it's-- in the demand environments that these people become, uhm, challenged. So you can also see that, you know, there's this issue about multiple, uhm, the effects of traumatic memories and multiple trauma exposures by this prefrontal, uhm, and amygdala of circuits and it, it gets back to this idea about post-traumatic sensitization source. So again, in treatment you see, it's not enough just to deal with the memory, you know, there's a whole graph of biological changes, uhm, that we need to be thinking about and re-regulating and, and, you know, we need to be advancing research into treatments like, ah, neurofeedback and it's amazing how, you know, like funding networks become dominated by particular schools of therapy, then rile against people who wanna try new things which is just way of such should not be, you know, in this way this field is beginning to derive itself because there are the schools of therapists who become very protective of the territory and we saw what they did in psychoanalysis? You know, psychoanalysis have great deal to offer but it doesn't explain everything. So what are the implications of this for prevention and treatment? You can see, nonspecific methods of decreasing stress reactivity is critical. And you see, that might be, that might be mindfulness meditation up in your feedback, it might be yoga, but it doesn't do everything. Uhm, what we need to be doing now, you see is understanding the scientific measurement and measuring that in patients to demonstrate this-- these regulations. Uhm, now we need to try new treatments but-- and look I'm not saying throw the, you know, evidence base-- uhm, therapies completely out the window because I don't think we can just, you know, ah, hold crystals over our patients and, and sort of have, have good thoughts, uhm, because, ah, you know, I think that can be very damaging because people think they might be getting real treatment. We know that there are treatments that work. So, you know, I'm not saying we should have a free for all, but, you know, I think one of the great things about this conference is we've seen many clinicians as one don't need to really talk much about treatment. Now, demonstrating what the-- they have shown, you know, with-- should-- what she actually did with the patient, you know, people claimed that they do CBT but God knows whether they do it. And I think actually looking at real patient examples and real patient material is just absolutely critical if we're really gonna be honest about how we treat people.

DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

01:01:40
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE And we need to share, uhm, improving executive function network, improving these mech-- these mechanisms of self-monitoring, self-regulation, I think it's the fundamental area where we have to do so, so much more work. And, you know, I think neurofeedback is one mechanism which I think might be really important because what that might do is to modulate this corti-- corticothalamic synchronization issues. You, you remember that meta-analysis of the thalamus was also found in PTSD. And that's-- in fact the EEG comes from, we have these loops that go backwards and forth between the cortex and thalamus, you know, you were digi-- ah, digital processor, you know. We've got to have treatments that address that sort of disruption. So just to conclude, you know, this is a disorder which is not just about bad thoughts, it's about the way the brain ceases to monitor, modulate, organize, focus, deal with the environment in-- and that affects multiple biological systems including inflammatory(ph) systems. So to summarize, the impact of multiple trauma exposure, so clinicians constantly ask your patients because, you know, I think there's been a distortion of the literature by focusing single incident trauma with short-term follow ups . You can see, you just don't get the story. And we-- we've got developed models of psychopathology that are based on a very minimal, uhm, literature of the real consequences and multiple traumatization is the rule not the exemption. See, that's why the whole issue of complex PTSD I think is probably relevant far beyond childhood trauma, you know, adult trauma-- traumatized people develop the same picture. Uhm, and this other issue about the probable disorder increasing with time due to progressive sensitization which is both because of the internal preoccupation of your traumatic memories. But it's because there's so many things in your external environment you, you modulate this effectively. So it's both you something you have to deal with internally but equally focused on why the person manages their external environment. So the problem with the field is the long-term co-- course is not adequately considered. We need to better demonstrate what conveys this long-term risk and that's what we're doing in-- we're gonna following this military populations. Is the issue of trauma and other disorders as well. You know, this is not a specific risk I think to PTSD, we need, you know, the, the trauma-related disorders shouldn't just be acute stress disorder, PTSD, it should be depression in a significant percentage of people. If you haven't got a highlighting for the, you know, bipolar or depressive genes, uhm, ah, ah, you know, this, ah, trauma tells us a great deal. And what we've got to constantly be aware of is missing the lessons of past or the past and reinventing, ah, you know, what we know. So to answer the questions I said to you at the beginning, individuals have coped become unwell and delayed onset is very common and, and is underestimated. Model psychopathology, sensitization and increasing physiological load is the critical issue. And I think the critical issue is about using neuroscience to inform clinical practice and that's really about understanding the relative neuro-- ah, neural circuits and the neural mechanisms. And we need theo-- theories of psychopathology that it-- informed by research non-dominant forms of psychotherapy. It's happened with psychoanalysis and I think now it be happening with cognitive and fear models. You know, don't just think that's, you know, just cuz you gone to psychology school and that's what you got taught. Don't think that's what the only thing that's important, you need to think about the brain too. And just to finish these are your treatment. See, the trouble is Freud(ph) actually re-discovered cognitive behavior therapy, it's just the people put different names on it and claimed it as a new form of treatments. 

01:05:30
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

01:05:30
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE All about sort of schools, religions, uhm, advocates, leaders, cults, you know, what we actually really need to get down to is I think addressing these issues of sensitization and (inaudible ). Thank you. 

01:05:50
[sil.] 

01:06:00
UNKNOWN I think it's too big a gap for go upon this presentation next without some intervening questions. So let's have two questions. 

01:06:10
[sil.] 

01:06:20
UNKNOWN Ah, my question is about loss, (inaudible ) loss. So I was wondering if you segue that into just sort of natural lot losing someone to depth etcetera, etcetera, you know, how's-- put a how's that a trauma segued onto PTSD ca-- car accidents, war and so on. Ah, and, ah, ah, that, that men who is describing his, ah, amputation talked about the sense of, ah, lost of some sense of God, etcetera, etcetera. So I wonder the sense of, the sense of loss of protective good, you know, that we, we think of as depression, we don't have the sense of something that's good around us and so on. How, how does that-- how do you see that working into PTSD, ah, and as the, you know, under de-- depression, unde-- under depression aspect of it? And then also just that this integrating thing aba-- about trauma its... 

01:07:30
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Well, I, I, I just wanna a very brief questions to, to makes the... 

01:07:35
ALEXANDER MCFARLANE Well, le-- le--- let me give, I mean, in fact the question you've ask really requires another lecture but I have only-- that's it. And I said that one second is, is tough. But look, I think the first thing to say is this, uhm, I think the issue of loss and, and the, and the nature of traumatic memories, ah, and, and memories of grief are actually quite different. I mean, there's a real longing with loss and now, this-- it's, it's the pleasant memories of the person whereas the difference between the person who seen their wife being killed in the car accident is they could captured by that moment of horror. So that-- I think that, that, they, they're both very important issues but they, they-- I think they actually con-- conflict with each other, uhm, so that, you know, is not something to be ignored by any means but it, it-- it's-- it, it, it creates different sort of pain, ah, I think than, uhm, and then you should about-- nobody that you, you, you-- but look I-- we can, you know, we could talk about for long a time but I think there's a simple answer. That's the way that I would address the point you raised. 

01:08:30
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Great, thank you. I think we'll go, go on. Uhm. The next presentation I think-- I know I haven't seen before you, ah, I think it could be very different. Uhm, next presentation-- Sandy(ph) talks about, uhm, the issue of the input of traumatic memories and many of the 60 days has talked about, I really to focus of our attention like in our work in a trauma setting namely to stabilize, desensitize to quiet people down, ah, but the issue of haunting traumatic memories as driving a lot and going psychopathology is critical. In our field we sometimes particularly working with kids lose sight at the memories need to be process. And to my mind still the most hazardly(ph) from research base, ah, ah, the best research for effective processing of traumatic memories is EMDR, ah, if anybody can do better than that I'd loved to see the work to prove that, but something else can do it but at, at this point EMDR is the standard treatment of specific traumatic memories. And because we have spent so much time on ethic regulation, desensitization, quieting oneself down, yoga, etcetera, etcetera, all very important things. I thought it is important to have a presentation on the processing of traumatic memories here. And so last year before I was in UCLA and I heard Debra Wesselmann, ah, give a beautiful presentation about working with kids, ah, with EMDR and I thought that's what we need to hear. And so Debra is from a, ah, is a social worker from Nebraska, ah, you don't get to meet people from Nebraska very often we, we-- people from Germany and, and England and Australia, India but Nebraska no, and that is great. Uhm, very exotic and, and then so Debra is a-- is an EDMR specialist and treat kids, ah, she has written a book called the Whole Parent, How to Become a Terrific Parent Even You Didn't-- Even If You Didn't Have One. I wish I'd-- you'd written that book now I have kids, ah, ah, ah, but my kids now can read it. Uhm, and the other one is integrating trauma in children family therapy at EDMR so great. 

01:11:00
DEBRA WESSELMANN Thank you. You get me hooked up. 

01:11:05
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

01:11:05
Debra Wesselmann, MS, LIMHP 

01:11:10
DEBRA WESSELMANN And while there, putting up my PowerPoint, uhm, talks just a bit more about myself. I got into the, the field of attachment really for personal reasons or that's what interested me in the beginning. Uhm, I have three children, two step children now, three grandchildren but, ah, my middle child came to us through adoption, uhm, and she came to us from Korea. This was back in 1982, she was almost 3 years old and, uhm, it was 10 years later when I was at a conference, I ran into her caseworker when I found out her trauma history. So it was, it was quite devastating to me to, uhm, to learn that there was a history that I didn't know that could have really helped to me. Uhm, but it was, it was because of her coming home to us that really led me into the field and getting interested in the field. And it's been, uhm, a very, very rewarding field. Uhm, this book-- don't look for it until September, it's, it's on the shelves on September but it's not there yet so-- and there is a-- an accompanying parent manual. The parent piece is very, very important-- I'll, I'll get into that later. Uhm, yes, over the past 15 years, three-quarter of a million children have been adopted from the U.S. Foster System. One-quarter of a million have been adopted from institutions overseas. Adoptive families utilize clinical services at two to five times the rate of biological families. Parents are four to seven times more likely to see residential care for adopted children. So the numbers are really astounding. Ah, in one study 259 families adopting from foster care, 58% reported giving insufficient information, I would be one of them and 37% reported that the child's behaviors were more serious than initially described. So families are really not prepared. Attachment trauma. This is what-- how, how I see it. Uhm, attachment trauma includes caregiver abuse or neglect, loss, separation from caregivers-- many of our children have had-- the children that we see have had even up to 30 different foster homes, 35 different foster homes so they have had caregiver loss, loss, loss, loss. Failure to protect by caregivers. Sometimes failure to protect by sexual abuse or there-- abuse from the other parent. Medical trauma, which causes a perception of failure to protect and people don't think about this but all of the children that go through surgeries, painful medical interventions in the first two, three, 4 years of life, they don't understand the pain, why is my pain not being relieved and this can actually, uhm, be very traumatic and actually be a relational trauma. So how does this look? Well, the behaviors are very scary, they are very scary to parents, they can be very scary to professionals, the behaviors can be very scary to teachers, principals and daycare providers. A lot of our kids being kicked out of daycare in numerous times, uhm, ah, suspended from school in kindergarten and first grade. So they have aggression sometimes toward caregivers, toward teachers, melt downs that can be very scary that include biting and kicking and throwing things, destroying property. They've lack of trust. They have a high need to be in control of their environment. 

01:15:25
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

01:15:25
DEBRA WESSELMANN Defiance, lying, stealing, sexualized behavior, lots of food and bathroom issues. We took about in our center, we talk a lot about poop and pee, you know, it's just a really common topic. You get really desensitized to it. So, uhm, ah, through the '90s even up, up until about 10 years ago, even less I guess, a predominant way of viewing this was to see these children as driven by rage and in need to be in control and it kind of stop there. And, and parents who, who learn this information, there's a lot of information on the internet that parents run into that, is really not helpful for them. Uhm, parents who learned that much became very frightened of their children, uhm, and the parenting strategies were very driven by fear so a lot of parents were even encouraged and used, uhm, parenting methods that I called the gotcha method of parenting. So it's kind of like, okay my kid he has a need to be in control and so I need to, to stay on top of him. And I need to, you know, outwit him, outsmart him, this kind of a gotcha, I got him, And then it, you know, use of consequences and kind of a, ah, sarcastic way, and in this method of parenting of course, uhm, increases the child's sense of mistrust and the sense of, "I'm bad" and, and your mean an-- I can't trust you. This is the way that we view the kids that come to our center. Naturally, we have to give them diagnosis, uhm, and the diagnosis that they come in with are usually multiple diagnosis of, uhm, reactive attachment disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, disruptive behavior disorder, ADD, you name it. Uhm, I think that this diagnosis would eliminate a lot of diagnosis and, and really would encompass and really tells us the etiology and helps to drive the treatment, uhm, and so I think we all know this, ah, this diagnosis, this proposed diagnosis and it, it-- it's so true, it's what we see for that early relational trauma impacts the children and, and their developmental trajectories socially, emotionally, cognitively and and affects their sense of self, their awareness of themselves, their ability to trust, their ability to regulate themselves, to manage their impulses and to process information. And once their ability to process has been impaired, as, as we know from the previous presentation and other presentations the last 3 days then it becomes even more difficult as new difficult experiences arise for the children to process those inf-- those pieces of information and those, ah, events. So I would like to talk a little bit about just how, uhm, attachment theory and Bowlby's theory of the internal working model fits kind of so well with, uhm, Shapi-- Francine Shapiro's adaptive information processing model. So Bowlby talks about how the earliest experiences and he was so brilliant, you know, back in the '40s and the '50s. He said that those earliest experiences with caregivers impact our beliefs about ourselves, others and our world. 

01:19:25
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

01:19:25
DEBRA WESSELMANN So Francine Shapiro who originated EMDR went on to say that the-- both a little T so the small T events and the big T events, the really distressing events in our lives are stored differently in the brain than other events. And that they are stored encapsulated in neural networks along with the associated negative beliefs, the affect, emotions, images, and later reminders of the events trigger that stored maladaptive material consciously or unconsciously. And so when we think about the child with a disorganized attachment, disorganized in relationship to unresolved, uhm, trauma or the experience of being with a caregiver who is frightening to them in some way. The little T and the big T trauma results in stored beliefs, let's say, I want to run to my parent but my parent is a source of danger. So there's that dilemma. Moms and dads are not safe, my world is not safe. I am bad and here's a big one, it's not safe to be vulnerable. This will come up later as we talk. The child who's experience caregiver loss which, you know, in, in our society when we find out the children have been abused, we remove them from their parents, giving the parents some time to see if they can rehabilitate, often they cannot and they are removed and put in into the foster system. I don't know about your states but the state of Nebraska is not a very good mommy, it does not make a good mom. Uhm, and so there are negative beliefs resulting from these losses people die or leave. It's not safe to get close to people, it's not safe to love. It results in hurt and pain. And it's up to me to take care of giving my own needs met. And once in needs, they get all mixed up. So then they have this what we call the survival brain. I have to be in charge of getting my needs met. Okay, so let's think about the EMDR for a minute. 

01:21:55
EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing) Involves 8 Scientific Steps 1. history-taking 2. preparation 3. assessment 4. desensitization 5. reprocessing 6. installation of the positive cognition 7. closure 8. follow-up evaluation EMDR Includes Implementation of Bilateral Stimulation... • may involve eye movements, tactile, or audio stimulation 

01:22:00
DEBRA WESSELMANN It involves eight steps, specific steps, which I won't go into but here they are and incorporated within those steps are, uhm-- is in bilateral stimulation which may involved eye movements. Most people are familiar with, you know, just the moving the eyes by watching the fingers. Uhm, It can involve, ah, tactile bilateral stimulation which might involved just tapping on the client's knees or hand or the child's feet. Uhm, sometimes we do the sort of elaborate, ah, where-- it's not elaborate. With-- We have this technological gadgets that helped us out. We have these machines, they have lights across the light bar and they can watch the lights with their eyes. The kids really love the gadgets. They have this, uhm, little pulsars that they hold. We called them buzzers or tappers and they t--, ah, buzz bilaterally back and forth. They also-- we also have some headphones that they can wear and they hear the tones bilaterally and it's a three-pronged approach. So, uhm, we treat the past memories, working through those past memories, kinda reaching into the emotions and the affect associated with those memories and desensitizing them and, and then reprocessing to form new beliefs related to those early memories. We ha-- we work with the present triggers and the recent triggers to the memories. And then we, we use the bilateral stimulation also to reinforce, uhm, future templates or positive skills and seeing themselves using positive skills in the future. Now with this complex trauma kiddos and adults, we often use a reverse protocol where we start with working on the future and really shore up their skills and their ability to regulate and, ah, cope in new ways and then we start working on current triggers and managing those triggers and then when, when they ha-- we have that rapport and we have them kind of shored up then we go back and start working on memories. So just in a real general way, I think that the real key to understanding these children's behaviors is to understand that the aggression, the anger and many of the other challenging behaviors are really there to help the child, to help the child avoid the underlying vulnerable feelings, the loss, the hurt, the sadness, the fear, the grief, the vulnerable feelings are too hard, and so there's a good reason for the big behaviors that it's there to, to save that child. So the EMDR is kind of, you know, has a blessing and a curse factor to it and that is that it accesses that right brain. It really does tap in to the emotion and we talk about the desensitization effect and that's, you know, overall what we're, what we're trying to do, but it actually first taps into the emotion that reaches into that right brain, reaches through the defenses. And so that's where we have to be very careful and it's very tricky. Because this is the power of the EMDR but, you know, but also it must be utilized very, very carefully. So one of the things that, that we do is we utilize the presence of caregivers. So the caregivers provide-- help to provide a secure holding environment when it got term to help increase regulation in the child and of course the therapeutic relationship is also important to that. Uhm, but we're also working on attachment trauma, so in my mind the child is not the only quaint, the relationship, the, the attachment relationship is the client too. And we wanna provide a window of opportunity for the parents to give comfort to the child during their processing and these increases the child's trust in that parent. If the parent is out of the room and the child is having some big emotion, and I'm providing the comfort in someway then, then I'm taking away the opportunity from that parent to formulate that relationship, to strengthen that relationship. And the other piece about having the parents in the room is, it gives them insight and understanding regarding the child's traumatic past. I, I think about sometimes I'll have a very emotional session with the, with the child and the parent in the room and I imagine to myself what would it be like if the parent was not witness to this, and the parent was out in the waiting room. And I finished up the session with, with some, you know, big feelings going on and kind of comforted that child, or regulated that child and then we found a good ending and then I send the child out of the waiting room. And one of the parent then said, "Oh, hi, come in let's go home, you've chores to do." You know, what would that be like? So we want to increase the parent's attunement. So we have an integrative model. One of the great things about EMDR is it's easy to integrate EMDR with whatever your model, wha-- whatever modalities you're comfortable with. So, uhm, nobody has to give up their modalities and everybody has, you know, areas where they feel comfortable working, uhm, whether it's, ah, the CBT or sensory motor, whatever area you work with, you can, you can integrate the EMDR really rather easily. We have a team approach, we have a, a family therapist and EMDR therapist team and often times we bring in an individual therapist, EMDR therapist for the parent or parents as well, and sometimes a couple's therapist cuz there are often marital issues going on. So we have a whole sort of team and meet weekly and we brainstorm, uhm, and it, it keeps our morale up. I always say when you worked with these kids to really have to be kind of unflappable and, uhm, and have this, uhm-- probably a pathological level of optimism. 

01:29:15
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

01:29:15
DEBRA WESSELMANN So, so I don't what that means exactly about us but, uhm, probably not good. Uhm, so, so we want-- the family therapist's role is to increase the parent's attunement to the child to, to help in building skills for self-regulation, to help with some new behavioral skills, to develop insight and understanding into the child's negative beliefs and their associated traumas for the parent and the child we-- they helped them start developing this insight and awareness. And then at the same time the EMDR therapist is beginning what we called the attachment resource development. So EMDR, the bilateral stimulation can also be used to strengthen or reinforced positive affect and what we're really doing here is we're creating I, I think-- well, Francine says, that what we're doing is, we're creating some new positive memory networks. I think that's probably correct. And what we try to do with this is create experiences of closeness in the session and then reinforced those experiences closeness with the bilateral stimulation. So, so prior to the trauma work, we used the EMDR in this way and, and what we wanna do is, is actually use a slower bilateral stimulation to, to increase more of the calmness and we wanna slow down and the, the bilateral stimulation tends to-- it opens up and increases the natural flow of associations. I think we're stimulating the prefrontal brain, we don't really know exactly why or how it works, uhm, but it's found that the eye movements tend to cause faster associations and we're, we're getting tapping into feelings and other, you know, various parts of the brain more quickly, whereas the, the tactile stimulation seems to slow things down and have more of a relaxation effects. So this is what we use when-- yes? 

01:31:35
UNKNOWN Can you show sample tapes? 

01:31:35
DEBRA WESSELMANN I'm going to the tapes next. Yes. So Ceid(ph) is about-- I think he's about four years old, four or 5 years old. He was, uhm, adopted or he's just in the process of getting adopted at the time of this video, he was removed from his home for abuse and neglect. There was no chance of going back into his home. He was actually use as a human shield during, uhm, a standoff with the police. So, uhm, one of the complaints that his adoptive mother had-- I'm gonna moved it to kind of the middle showing a snippet of several videos but one of the complaints that she had was that he was very stiff, and it was very difficult for her to, to hug him, he-- he wouldn't cuddle and one of the things we do in our resource development is we ask kids often times to draw a picture of a safe place for the littler kid that listen inside their hearts. Now, we work with children with the inner child all the time and a lot of people don't think of working with an inner child with a child but we do this all the time, we work with the littler child inside or the baby self inside and, and kids get it right away. They have absolutely no difficulty understanding this. So, uhm, he's drawing a safe place for baby Cied(ph). And then what we do is we put the new parent in the safe place and then we give the opportunity for the new parent to talk about how they are comforting and caring for the little baby self in the safe place inside the child's heart today. Now we make sure that the child understands we're not going back in time right now. 

01:33:35
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

01:33:40
DEBRA WESSELMANN We-- We're not going back to the trauma. We are working with the little-- littler baby child self that lives in the heart today. And, and this gives us all kinds of opportunity in a sense for that parent to go back in time and meet some unmet needs of the child. 

01:34:05
UNKNOWN It's inside our hearts and Ceid(ph) even you'd have little baby sit inside your heart. Even mommy has a, a baby in her heart. Yeah. I have a baby in my heart. Baby (inaudible ) in my heart. And so we wanna draw, a drawing that there will be a nice and safe for the little baby Ceid(ph) that lives inside your heart. Oh, what you're drawing there? 

01:34:30
CEID A crib. 

01:34:30
UNKNOWN A crib, of course. Excellent. 

01:34:35
CEID Every baby needs a... 

01:34:35
DEBRA WESSELMANN Every baby needs a crib he says. So we're gonna move, move on a little bit. Now she's-- now you're not going to hear much of this, so I'm just gonna show a snippet here, for to hear. 

01:34:50
UNKNOWN Stay close to her so you've got safe. 

01:34:55
[sil.] 

01:35:00
DEBRA WESSELMANN Now he's holding the tappers which you can't really see but they're buzzing bilaterally and she's talking about what she is doing for the little baby Ceid(ph) inside his heart. 

01:35:10
UNKNOWN Just enough. So you'll be safe and warm and not scared. 

01:35:15
CEID He's scared? 

01:35:20
UNKNOWN It's like you're doing really good with learning this relaxation. Your arms are all relaxed. Your hands are all relaxed. 

01:35:30
[sil.] 

01:35:35
DEBRA WESSELMANN I'm calling his attention now - 

01:35:35
UNKNOWN Open your ears. 

01:35:40
DEBRA WESSELMANN - to the feelings the sensations in his own body. 

01:35:45
[sil.] 

01:35:50
DEBRA WESSELMANN Mom said later this was the first time she have that... 

01:35:50
UNKNOWN How is that feel to you my baby? 

01:36:00
UNKNOWN It's very nice. 

01:36:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:36:00
UNKNOWN It's nice cuddling him more. He's all relaxed you can (inaudible ). 

01:36:03
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:36:05
UNKNOWN I like that. 

01:36:10
[sil.] 

01:36:15
UNKNOWN And now for a little bit more. (inaudible ). 

01:36:25
DEBRA WESSELMANN Oh, I love his face. I loves it, look it beyond. 

01:36:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, that's good. 

01:36:40
DEBRA WESSELMANN And so, and so what you're doing is calling attention as you're, as you're adding the bilateral stimulation with the, the tappers or the buzzers. Uhm, you're calling attention to the child, to the feelings in the body that they've maybe never felt before. And, and I'm also reinforcing, uhm, phrases like-- I'm using phrases like, notice how safe it is to be in your mom's arms, notice how safe it is to allow your mom to care for you and to be in charge of you because these are the shifts that we want the child to begin making.

DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

01:37:25
DEBRA WESSELMANN Here's an old... 

01:37:25
UNKNOWN So, uhm, would you let mommy in charge of this? 

01:37:30
DEBRA WESSELMANN This is, ah, my colleague, Stephanie(ph), and this is a, a child who's-- I think she is about 10 in this video. She was adopted from Guatemala when she was 3, and like a lot of the kids, uhm, who come into foster care or adoptive care, the mom said, we thought she was fine because she just always had a kind of a smile plastered on her face, uhm, she never cried, she never asked for anything. And a lot of times adoptive parents think, "Wow, what a well-adjusted child." And, and of course they don't realized that the child has learned that having needs and feelings is useless and maybe even dangerous and so they have shut down those, those feelings and needs. And they don't know how to turn to a caregiver for help or comfort, uhm, and it doesn't even occurred to them and so of course they have to develop all kinds of defenses and behaviors to hide and, and repress all of their, their more vulnerable emotions. And, uhm, and Maria's(ph)-- of course the, the more vulnerable emotions then come out through these big behaviors and the complaints were theme meltdowns and stealing and lying and there was no trust with her parents. Uhm, she wa-- and she would shut down-- she was a child who often just shut down. And she is the middle of 13 children in this family, uhm, and all the other children are biological children. And so, you know, she feels a sense of, "I, I don't belong." So this is a, a little game we play and you, you can see, ah, Stephanie(ph) is holding the remote for these little buzzers that we use and this is the lollipop game and I used-- I made used the lollipop for years before, you know, I did some presentations with Joan Lovett, if you're familiar with her work, uhm, and her narrative methods but she came up then with a lollipop game which I like, which is you, you ask the, uhm, the-- you tell the child, "This is a game", and, uhm, the parent holds the lollipop and the child's role is to signal the parent with their eyes or their mouth when they want the lollipop in. And when they want it out and then the, the mom's role or the pa-- dad's role is to watch the child's cues and so it's a little bit of a game and, and then the, ah, therapist is utilizing the bilateral stimulation kinda-- kind of slow which the children find very relaxing and some of the parents will say, "Can we take this home?" But, but no, we don't let them use in the home, but, uhm, ah, the, ah, the therapist will use-- again use the tappers as they called the child's attention to things like notice how calm and relax-- do you feel-- notice how safe it is to let mom be in charge to that lollipop? Notice how fun it is to let mom take care of you. Okay. So we'll just see again a little bit of this one. 

01:41:00
UNKNOWN Sucker, okay, but there's a couple of things, you know, most people when they put a sucker in their mouth, right, how long do they keep in their mouth? Do you think a really, really long time or sometimes they have to take it out? Yup, Uh-hmm. Uhm, so it'll be your job to give your mom a signal to let her know that's you want things. 

01:41:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:41:23
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. Well, you-- if you wanted to think about that little Maria(ph), I think inside-- I think that she will like this. Uh-hmm. Because it's not like a bottle, isn't it? Uh-hmm. And little Maria(ph) inside in her safe place is really gonna enjoy and yet, how does this feels, I really think she will and big Maria(ph) might, too, right. Yeah, okay. All right. So let's just get started so give mom a some of sign that you like to have the, the sucker. 

01:41:55
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

01:41:55
DEBRA WESSELMANN It really awkward at first and we'll kind of move along into the session. 

01:42:00
UNKNOWN Just give your mom a signal. 

01:42:10
DEBRA WESSELMANN When she came back the next week, they did this again and, and she said, when I laughed last week I was scared, I would never get to do this again. So, so just to show you. It's awkward at first but it continues. Okay. So now, uhm, I'm gonna show you a little bit more with, with, processing. Uhm, I'm gonna start with a little bit-- with a little boy. I'm gonna show you what we might do-- what we do some with the little, little ones. 

01:42:55
UNKNOWN I have a story about this little baby. 

01:43:00
DEBRA WESSELMANN Okay, Scott(ph) was adoptive from Guatemala too. And his parents said-- his adoptive parents, ah, went to get him when he was a year and half. He'd been with a foster family for most of his little life and he probably assumed that his foster mother was his mother and his foster-- his adoptive parents said, it was like a kidnapping. They felt like kidnappers. He was devastated and, uhm, he had a lot of aggression toward his adoptive mom. He-- this little cute little guy in the, in the wa-- in the mall, uhm, Westroads Mall, ah, security was called to, to carry this child out of the mall because he was having such a huge meltdown in the middle of the mall. And, and he-- and his mother was just helpless to do anything. So, I'm actually telling his trauma story with bears and, uhm, and I don't have a tappers in him yet at the end of a story. We add-- we-- ah, the bilateral stimulation. So I'm kind of tapping into his trauma with the story and you will see he is, he is completely - 

01:44:20
UNKNOWN Like this little baby bear was just little... 

01:44:25
DEBRA WESSELMANN focused. She was taking care of by this tiger Neddie(ph). Neddie(ph) was such a good caregiver. Neddie(ph) rocked the little bear and Neddie(ph) set a bottle to the little bear and Neddie(ph) would say, everything's okay. You're such a good little baby. And Neddie(ph) said to the little bear, I'm taking care of you until your forever mommy and your forever daddy can get here and then they'll be able to take care of you forever and ever. But forever mommy and the forever dad. Oh, they were so happy. They were so happy to finally get to hold their little boy-- be-- bear. All the mama bear, just loved her little boy-- bear so much. She said I'll never let you go. I will take care of you forever and forever and forever. I will feed you everyday. I will hug you everyday. 

01:45:50
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

01:45:55
DEBRA WESSELMANN Now we'll move on to the-- toward the end whatever came with the-- let's see. I can grab this. Now we're adding the bilateral stimulation. 

01:46:05
UNKNOWN Is he have... 

01:46:05
DEBRA WESSELMANN Sorry about the camera work. 

01:46:10
UNKNOWN Mom and dad. You have a little boy bear that's happy forever with his new mom and new dad. Forever mommy loved him everyday, fed him and clothe him and kept him safe, give him kisses and hugs. And forever daddy loved his little boy everyday, talk to him at night, walk them up in the morning, give him kisses and hugs, fed him and loved him and kept him safe. And they were forever family everyday and everyday, always safe and always loved... 

01:47:00
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

01:47:00
DEBRA WESSELMANN So that's a little bit of the work with Scott(ph). We also did-- we did a lot of, uhm, bilateral stimulation with songs and we make up a lot of songs like two toon of the Wheels on the Bus. Uhm, uhm, mommy and daddy, you know, love their little boy and, ah, sing with the-- and patty caking. Uhm, so you can get that, you can be really creative with getting that bilateral stimulation in there sometimes and basically we're, we're really working with those, those negative beliefs at this child carries, ah, I'm not safe and I'm not loved. I wanna move on now to a little bit of work with Anna(ph). 

01:47:45
UNKNOWN What does he think? Helped by the foster parent? 

01:47:50
DEBRA WESSELMANN He-- no, no this-- that was his adoptive mom. The foster parent is back in Guatemala. Yeah, yeah. That's not the one that I wanna show. So, uhm... 

01:48:05
UNKNOWN Learns a lot while he watches. 

01:48:10
DEBRA WESSELMANN So Anna(ph) or Diana(ph), ah, I'm the family therapist with Anna(ph) and my colleague Stephanie(ph) is the EMDR therapist. So you'll see a little of mine and then a little of hers. Anna(ph) is-- was adopted at 7 months from a Chinese orphanage. She claims that she can remember being in the orphanage, who knows? She, she described the cribs and her mom said, "Oh my gosh," that's, that's what they looked like. Uhm, she-- when she came in, one of the most anxious kids I've ever worked with, she was-- she, she was too scared to ever been in the waiting room, uhm, she was scared of kids, scared of-- scared to death of babies especially crying babies and she said those crying babies are crying at me just like the babies in the orphanage. They were always crying at me. And the mom said that when she picked drop of course no crying. She did not cry. Brought to home, no crying, never cried. Uhm, she had never cried until we started our, our work with her, lots of behaviors, meltdowns, picking until she bleed. Uhm, and now is-- and now what happens is a so-- if she comes in sometimes she'll come in, she'll sit down, she'll pick and she'll say I've got a, I've got a feeling going on, I've got a feeling going on. We'll get it the feeling and we'll work with it and, and the picking is gone. Uhm, but here's in a little bit in the beginning of the therapy with, with Anna(ph). 

01:49:45
UNKNOWN So breathe with your belly nice and big indeed. At over here look at me (crosstalk). Nice and big right, you know. 

01:49:55
UNKNOWN See if you can relax. Your-- your body with your big belly breath. There you go. See if you can get your whole body to relax with belly breaths. That's it, keep trying. Good. Keep trying. 

01:50:20
UNKNOWN Stretch it. 

01:50:20
UNKNOWN There you are. 

01:50:20
UNKNOWN Oh no (inaudible ) hurt someone. 

01:50:22
DEBRA WESSELMANN She's a lot of autistic features as do a lot of the kids out in the orphanages. 

01:50:25
UNKNOWN This would be... 

01:50:30
UNKNOWN Okay, okay, which your brain in charge of your... 

01:50:30
DEBRA WESSELMANN And she's developmentally delayed. 

01:50:30
UNKNOWN So good if you could learn to do this, Anna(ph), you could use it so many places, even at school. 

01:50:40
ANNA It's so hard to do. 

01:50:40
UNKNOWN But you have to practice like anything that gets easier. 

01:50:45
ANNA I keep-- but I'm, ah, doing it in here better. 

01:50:50
UNKNOWN Well, to start in here. Start with it in here. So breath, keep cool. Let's all do it together. Oh yeah, all that feels nice and relaxing. 

01:51:05
DEBRA WESSELMANN Everybody is doing it but Anna(ph). 

01:51:05
UNKNOWN My arms and legs can't get to be... 

01:51:10
DEBRA WESSELMANN So let's go. We'll go a little bit more toward then to the end of the session. 

01:51:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) trust me, very well. Yeah. Anna(ph) maybe you could teach Lenny(ph) that I'm okay and I can be trusted. 

01:51:25
ANNA She doesn't like to be touch a lot. 

01:51:25
DEBRA WESSELMANN Lenny(ph) is a little plastic guinea pig and, and Lenny(ph) came with her this session. Lenny(ph) was definitely a little child part. Uhm, we-- and, and-- so, so my colleague-- you won't see this cuz we didn't tape it unfortunately, but when she was doing EMDR with Anna(ph) at one point she had Anna(ph) holding the tappers on Lenny(ph), the little plastic guinea pig, working with Lenny's(ph) feelings. 

01:51:55
ANNA Drinking more a (inaudible ). 

01:51:56
UNKNOWN To be touched? 

01:51:56
ANNA Yes. I've been taking (inaudible ). 

01:52:00
UNKNOWN Do you like to be touched? 

01:52:00
ANNA Not all and even (inaudible ) . 

01:52:05
UNKNOWN Yes, I'm gonna to scratch you. 

01:52:05
ANNA Well, I like to that feeling... 

01:52:05
UNKNOWN Do you let me hold you at home sometimes? 

01:52:10
UNKNOWN Come and sit in my chair. 

01:52:10
ANNA You, you make me feel left out. 

01:52:15
UNKNOWN Oh, thank you for telling me that. Well, that's good to tell mom. 

01:52:20
DEBRA WESSELMANN She was staying with mom. 

01:52:20
UNKNOWN Leave you out, I'm just (crosstalk). 

01:52:25
UNKNOWN I'm not trying to leave you out. 'm just trying to re-- read the paper. I'm not gonna leave you out. All people in the whole world, you're the last person I want to be left. I was... 

01:52:45
UNKNOWN Can you hear your mom? 

01:52:45
UNKNOWN I always include you first. 

01:52:50
UNKNOWN What if you could look at mom while she says that this time? See if you can look at mom. 

01:52:55
UNKNOWN Do you look at my eyes, can you look in mom's yes? Can you look in them? 

01:53:00
ANNA When this therapy is over. 

01:53:00
DEBRA WESSELMANN When this therapy is over. 

01:53:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, we're almost ready for Stephanie's(ph)... 

01:53:05
ANNA I'll be over-- I worry (inaudible )... 

01:53:08
UNKNOWN Ah, pretty close. Can you not avoid my hands? Can you look at my eyes? 

01:53:10
UNKNOWN Inquisitive cuz this is so important. It's really important. 

01:53:15
ANNA I love you. 

01:53:15
UNKNOWN I know, never-- look at my eyes. Look at my eyes. I will never want to leave you out. I always want you to be part of things. Look at my eyes. And I'm just reading the paper, I'm just reading the paper. It does-- I don't read the paper to leave you out. I just read the paper to check the weather and get the news. You-- you're much more important to me than a newspaper it. 

01:53:40
ANNA Uh-hmm. 

01:53:40
UNKNOWN Always, okay? 

01:53:45
ANNA Uh-hmm. 

01:53:45
UNKNOWN Are you sure? 

01:53:50
UNKNOWN You... 

01:53:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:54:00
DEBRA WESSELMANN Oh, could you say that louder, I'm sorry. Can you? 

01:54:00
UNKNOWN This isn't about do it a parent boundary violation? 

01:54:05
DEBRA WESSELMANN Between the mom and the girl? 

01:54:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:54:10
DEBRA WESSELMANN With, you know, when we're doing, when we're doing attachment work, there's lots of, of, uhm, of touch and it doesn't feel like a boundary violation at all in the session. Uhm, because we're really working with a younger developmental age she's-- yeah, developmentally, she's about six and, ah, maybe seven and it-- but even younger than that emotionally, socially, uhm, so believe it or not, it's just that it's not-- it doesn't feel the-- a bit like a boundary vio--violation. It's kind of funny because when you ask that, it's like, "Oh, I supposed it does look like that." But to me, it doesn't because it's a part of this-- it becomes a part of this session, it's a part of the work that we do with the closeness and the touch. Uh-hmm. 

01:54:55
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

01:55:00
DEBRA WESSELMANN And there's no, ah, there's no sexual feeling to it at all or, ah, sexual, uhm, issue here between the mom and the daughter so - 

01:55:10
ANNA In the picture of the immaculate? 

01:55:10
UNKNOWN On the picture of immaculate? 

01:55:10
ANNA Uh-uhm. 

01:55:15
DEBRA WESSELMANN This is a... 

01:55:15
UNKNOWN Anymore important from that? 

01:55:15
ANNA Uh-uhm. 

01:55:15
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. Did you know that there's over a billion people in China alone. They sent the best home with you. How about you? There's billions of people in the world and if I had to pick time to spend with one-- do you know who that I've to pick and for whole wide world? 

01:55:40
ANNA No. You really want to pick one? I don't no... 

01:55:45
UNKNOWN I really want. I really... 

01:55:50
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

01:55:50
DEBRA WESSELMANN So that's it. It is a very touching moment and, and by, by getting her regulated and by, by through the touch and the connection and what she had said earlier with her mom and she liked to be scratched that's how she like to be touched. We, we are able to make that, that very important connection right there. And then the, the family therapy piece, regulating the child, calming the child, and making those, those connections between parent and child then allows the EMDR therapist to move in and do, do the EMDR. I'm gonna-- I'll show just a little bit of this one. This is, ah, Stephanie(ph) working with Anna on a current trigger with boys at school. She gets ve-- she is rich, pre-puberty. So yeah, you have this mixed of developmental delays, emotional, social delays and yet hitting puberty and she has these reactions to boys where she gets, uhm, kind of manicky at school and so, uhm, Stephanie is using the thera-tappers and having Anna(ph) bring up the, ah, picture of, of situations in school where she gets very manicky and having her practice as a future template, uhm, managing these, these situations. 

01:57:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. Better. 

01:57:30
DEBRA WESSELMANN So she's holding the tappers and picturing. 

01:57:35
[sil.] 

01:57:45
DEBRA WESSELMANN Now it's getting hard. She's getting a little-- little many either. 

01:57:50
[sil.] 

01:57:50
ANNA (inaudible ) and the booking. 

01:58:05
UNKNOWN That's okay. You're not a chubby, you know. 

01:58:05
UNKNOWN You mean, you replaced the nervous feeling with the low alert behavior? 

01:58:10
ANNA Uh-huh. 

01:58:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, she did, you know they thought about the bon fire. 

01:58:15
UNKNOWN When she was on low alert, nice. I will give you a standing O. Standing O, Wooh! 

01:58:20
DR. BESSEL VAN DER KOLK'S 24TH ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL TRAUMA CONFERENCE 

01:58:25
DEBRA WESSELMANN So this is the way we can incorporate, you know, the skills we're reinforcing it with the bilateral stimulation, uhm, which really internalizes it for the kids. I wanna show this to show the importance of-- or how, how beautiful it can be to have a parent in the room, while you're doing trauma work and Danny(ph) was adopted at two and half or at three up until two and a half, he had court-ordered visits to his biological father. And nobody knew until, you know, that's-- the session the week before this that he remembered being dropped off and that this was a trauma for him and he believed it felt and he's got like he's adoptive parents didn't want him and that they were abandoning him every time they dropped him off. And we're processing that memory and his dad is there with us. 

01:59:25
UNKNOWN When we have a discussion they always seem to come back to her mother. 

01:59:35
[sil.] 

01:59:50
UNKNOWN Okay, take a breath. 

01:59:55
[sil.] 

02:00:00
UNKNOWN It's better. 

02:00:05
[sil.] 

02:00:15
DEBRA WESSELMANN His processing is very slow. 

02:00:20
UNKNOWN That's him, uhm, pictures? 

02:00:30
[sil.] 

02:00:35
DEBRA WESSELMANN And maybe because the haft(ph). And he's trying hard not to cry. 

02:00:45
[sil.] 

02:01:00
UNKNOWN It's okay, it's okay if you're still feeling sad. You are still feeling sad? Dan(ph), are you feeling sad? 

02:01:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

02:01:10
UNKNOWN And I'm feeling sad. Yeah. It's-- it, it is sad Danny(ph), it's sad for that little boy. It's sad for that little boy. It's sad for that little boy but you had to go through that. It's so sad. 

02:01:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's hard knowing that you had so much stuff to go through and we couldn't touch you. 

02:01:30
UNKNOWN It's okay. It's okay. Just let yourself grief for that little boy. We have to go through that, Danny(ph). It was so hard. I'm scared. It's so hard. I'm so sorry you've had to go through that. We're always sorry you have to go through that. 

02:02:00
[sil.] 

02:02:05
UNKNOWN Where do you feel it? 

02:02:05
DANNY On the park. 

02:02:10
UNKNOWN Okay. You said yourself. Any word would you say to that little boy, that little Danny(ph)? What would you wanna say? 

02:02:25
DANNY Sorry. 

02:02:25
UNKNOWN Dad, what would you say? What would it be? 

02:02:30
UNKNOWN It wasn't fair with you. I'm sorry (inaudible ). 

02:02:40
DEBRA WESSELMANN Uhm, later on. 

02:02:40
UNKNOWN Take a breath. 

02:02:45
[sil.] 

02:02:50
DEBRA WESSELMANN That's very important to have the dad with him and regulating the... 

02:03:00
UNKNOWN Oh, good. Just notice that relieve feeling, the relax feeling. 

02:03:10
DEBRA WESSELMANN This was a boy when they brought him in, they were in the process of filling out papers for Boys Town, which is a long-term program where he would have gone for one to 3 years. And, uhm, and yet his trauma turned out his biggest trauma was, ah, related to feeling abandoned and unwanted. So his behaviors were aggression meltdown, tossing the wall, pushing mom and dad, all covering up these deeper more vulnerable feelings. So I think this is, uhm, this is the conclusion and I, I sh-- should I take a question or do we have time, or no? I think it's okay. 

02:03:55
UNKNOWN I think there's no question... 

02:03:55
DEBRA WESSELMANN That's good, okay. So I will conclude now. Thank you very much. 

02:04:00
