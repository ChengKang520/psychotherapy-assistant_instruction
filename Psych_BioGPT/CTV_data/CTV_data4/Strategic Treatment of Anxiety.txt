REID WILSON, PhD 

00:00:40
UNKNOWN Well Adam, thank you for coming up here. Umm… Since you're new to the… this field Adam has come in from a local area to do this work with me. Uh… Maybe you just wave to them so we see what you get back if you wave to them. 

00:01:00
ADAM Good afternoon. 

00:01:00
UNKNOWN Okay. So we're gonna pull… the shade down, right so they're not here, you're not gonna hear from them again until I say goofy things and then they will laugh out loud but just ignore them, so. 

00:01:15
ADAM Got it. 

00:01:15
UNKNOWN Okay with you? 

00:01:15
ADAM Yes. 

00:01:20
UNKNOWN So… so we have a little less than an hour so we're gonna go fast which I think you're gonna want me to go fast because we'll get more done that way, you know. so I may have to cut corners on some things. I am gonna interrupt you and that's only to like if I get enough information I'm gonna move on to the whatever I need next. 

00:01:35
ADAM Okay. 

00:01:40
UNKNOWN Seems okay to you? 

00:01:40
ADAM Yeah. 

00:01:40
UNKNOWN Okay, so let's just start present-tense. What's going on these last few weeks, what are you trying to… what are you trying to fix? 

00:01:50
ADAM Umm… about probably six months ago uh… maybe a little bit longer I was up in front of so my job is I'm a director of sales. Generally I'm in front of people all the time doing presentations. Not to this scale but umm… generally groups of 20-30 people so I was up on doing a quarterly business review with my… my employees and some additional folks who support us and I started in on my… my presentation, I welcomed everyone, everyone… everything started going well. 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN Uh-Oh… 

00:02:35
ADAM Yeah, I got into my slide deck uh… which was really only a couple… couple of slides and it was really a… a layup. The QBR was not about me the QBR was about my team and all I had to do is just get through these you know, five minutes which was easy, used to be easy uh… and all of a sudden I'm starting to go and then I'm looking I… I throw a joke out there that goes flat and… 

00:03:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible) done that. 

00:03:10
ADAM So I start to look… I started looking at the audience and I'm like holy crap uh… what am I doing up here and then also I'm thinking my material that I present… about to present is way off base, isn't on point, my boss's boss is there uh… and us get absolutely flooded. My heart rate is out of my you know, about to bounce out of me, shortness of breath uh… loss of you know, feeling everywhere and uh… I'm like holy crap, I got to get out of here. I'm… I'm going to get out of here. There's nothing I can do and meanwhile I'm talking or trying to and inside my head there is like 5,000 voices and scenarios and options and… and options of options and, you know, effects of what's gonna happen if I do this in within like, a second and… 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN So let me just say that's impressive, isn't it? 

00:04:20
ADAM Oh, yeah. 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN I mean, when you're in that. 

00:04:20
ADAM Yeah, yeah absolutely. 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN How rapidly… 

00:04:25
ADAM Well, how rapidly and how… 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN so many options come together and… 

00:04:25
ADAM (inaudible). 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN Well… well, I'm… I'm kind of acknowledging how quickly the mind puts all those out in there to make choices about what, you may have run at that point but I'm just saying if you had that where with all of… 

00:04:45
ADAM Yeah 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN …all those things unconscious. 

00:04:45
ADAM Right. 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN That wasn't you consciously but that was… it was working for your betterment because it got a signal something's going south. 

00:04:55
ADAM Right, right. 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN Oh, I was interrupting, yeah so… 

00:04:55
ADAM so I… I made the decision at that moment I'm out… I'm (inaudible) out, I'm just gonna deal with it, you know, I had no plan, I handed the… controller clicker to uh… a person and I said, "I think I'm gonna be sick" and out. And then I barricaded myself in the bathroom sending texts to my ex-wife, to my girlfriend saying it's over. I've just ended my career I didn't know what to do. They were responding back, "Oh it's not that bad, just get back out there and go, you know, walk in there." Not a chance. So after sitting in there for almost an hour now I'm… I've… I've come up with this plan to fake food poisoning and just get out, just leave the… the building. We're at our uh… corporate headquarters and so uh… so… so I did I faked uh… I've made it seem like I had food poisoning uh… everyone still thinks I had food poisoning and I got out of that place and back into my hotel room filled with shame, uh… embarrassment, fear that this is gonna happen again like this is my… this is what I do, I've never had this issue in my life and but this is what I do and in fact I do it, you know, at least once every quarter for these quarterly business reviews. So flash forward moving… moving past that I'm like okay well, maybe I wasn't prepared enough, you know, maybe I just got a little overwhelmed as a fluke. The next QBR happens and much smaller group, I feel much more comfortable with the… the audience I mean, it's still my team uh… my boss is there but we have a great relationship uh… and I'm about to go… ten minutes before I was in the… in my car doing some mindful meditation and like okay just, you know, keep it together. They'll laugh at you, just kick it off and I… I studied, I practiced my stuff. This, I was… I was now prepared, the last one I wrote off as I wasn't prepared. So I get up there and I'm about to go and holy crap out of nowhere the same exact feelings same… and now my mind is like, "Oh my god, I can't, I've already burned the match. I can't say I'm sick again. It's not gonna happen and I'm… I'm literally like pacing (inaudible) from about to kick it off and I talked to my boss and say, "Hey, do you wanna go first? Just… you, you know, you wanna go?" And like," No, no, no you got it." I'm all like, "You have no idea how little I got it right now, right? And uh… and I just and… and then right before I kick it off some yahoo for my teams like, "Hey Adam, you never told us what happened last time." You know, or… cause he wasn't there. He's like, "Well, what happen?" You know and I'm like, "Holy crap" I just, you know, be quiet and somehow uh… I must should do it. I mean I was feeling it, I had… but I had nowhere to run that time. 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN So take a stepping stone from there to now. 

00:08:25
ADAM So… so three more incidents, same exact reaction. One was in the interview, one-on-one like this and I started melting down. That guy across the table must thought I was just crazy umm… but I was able to get through it but it was very awkward and then what led me to reaching out to get some specific therapy on this was two meetings back-to-back Tuesday Wednesday two weeks ago. All I had to do is introduce myself. Right here was my boss two of my colleagues and me. "Hi, Adam Toll, I am you know, director of sales, I run Southern California." That's it and I could barely even say that. 

00:09:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:09:10
ADAM I mean it came out I swear the first one was "Adam Toll enterprise" I mean that… close. Close but the thing is no one knows, right? But… but for me to get that out was like… it just it was paralyzing. And then sitting there for the rest meeting I'm like man I have something I can offer here. I have something I want to say. But I'm doing the math like man that's too long. That's too… my… my point is too long I'm not gonna survive. If there was just a quick hit or uh… you know, add on piggyback off a sentence I would be fine but this was my thought this was a… and uh… and I… I was upset that I couldn't add what I thought value. 

00:10:00
UNKNOWN This is the second event? 

00:10:00
ADAM This was the first so and then the… the next… the next meeting uh… I did better but the reason why did better was… I was like, "Okay I got to get these stupid introductions done with." And so when we first met the… the day before we did the, "Hi, I'm Adam nice to meet you." Day two I was like, "hey I'm Adam toll run Southern California enterprise sales." Hoping that everyone else would fall in line and… and we wouldn't have to do the down the line kind of thing and uh… sure enough we ended up having do the down the line thing but I had developed a little bit more poor with the person we were meeting with and it was just one person and I felt a little bit more comfortable uh… but I still… I still struggled at that point. Later in the meeting I was able to interject quite a bit more than, than the day before but umm… 

00:10:55
UNKNOWN Let's go the third. 

00:10:55
ADAM Yeah and so that was it. So are the interview and then the two back-to-back meetings and now I'm here in the parking lot of the end of the second meeting umm… I got… I literally called a local therapist who I'd worked with in the past asked for reference and he called me while I was in the parking lot and then I've met with that person two times in the last… 

00:11:20
UNKNOWN She's here. 

00:11:20
ADAM Yes. 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN Okay so, what's going on? 

00:11:25
ADAM Umm… 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN What do you… what's your sense? 

00:11:30
ADAM Well, there's… there's a lot of sense there's a lot of ton of stress in uh… life. Work related specifically uh… this is the first full year of divorce. Even though I had been… we had really been separated for last four years uh… but this was the first you know, full year of actually being divorced. Uh… so with that there's been a lot of, you know, uh… change in my living… 

00:11:55
UNKNOWN But was there something about… that absolute divorce moment? That was different than being separated but did it feel like… 

00:12:05
ADAM Uh… It felt… it felt more definitive. Uh… 

00:12:10
UNKNOWN Ending more… crystally on ending more or… 

00:12:15
ADAM Yeah it was just more (inaudible) more real. 

00:12:15
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:12:15
ADAM Cause we had sort of been uh… not really addressing the separation I mean we should have… we should have divorced four years ago but we were in this weird place for three years where we didn't really you know, address it. We were sort of were inefficiently being co-parents and living separately. 

00:12:40
UNKNOWN Do you see a connection between that divorce and what…? 

00:12:45
ADAM No, I see the… the biggest well, what I see is underlined stress that that is created uh… now specific to work uh… they moved me into a position. It's been a really rough year work wise. Mind you I am in no jeopardy of losing my job. None I mean I've great relationship with my… my boss. Zero umm… but the place where they put me is just this… this place of powerlessness. Uh… the quotas that they handed out knowingly are… are far too aggressive for my team… 

00:13:20
UNKNOWN This happened… 

00:13:20
ADAM This happened January. 

00:13:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:13:25
ADAM January fourth was my… 

00:13:25
UNKNOWN When was the divorce? 

00:13:25
ADAM January fourth was the divorce date. Uh… and then they moved me into this new role uh… with this boss who I'd worked with in the past. Three weeks into it that guy left. He just… he was on a sort of a demoting decline and so he bailed. So now I was reporting to his boss uh… and his… 

00:13:50
UNKNOWN That's January. All that's January, right? 

00:13:50
ADAM All that's January- February. 

00:13:50
UNKNOWN And the pan… first little panic… 

00:13:55
ADAM Panic attack would've been… March… April. April-May just don't know when. 

00:14:00
UNKNOWN So let me give you some… a piece of information. 

00:14:00
ADAM Yes. 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN Panic disorder for a lot of people the first panic attack comes after six to eight months of stress. The theme of the stress is often loss. Seemed to fit? 

00:14:20
ADAM Yeah (inaudible). 

00:14:25
UNKNOWN So here's… here's the problem with that is when people come in like you they don't make that connection temporarily because, you know, four months later you have this experience and so you don't go, "Oh, it's this and then that has happened and they're connected." Can you imagine they're connected? 

00:14:45
ADAM Yeah. 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN Why would they be connected? 

00:14:50
ADAM Why would… why would… 

00:14:50
UNKNOWN Why would this stuff be connected to the… this freak out? That's a clinical term you're familiar with that? 

00:14:55
ADAM Yeah, freak out. Uh… so ph, you know. uh… so well, I'll tell you I get up there and I'm presenting in front of a… a group of people who see me as having zero power because they've been stuck with quotas all year uh… that they can't uh… meet. My company has done a horrible job of supporting us in this new role in fact come, you know, in a few weeks we were going back to the old way, you know, and the Adam is always a good cit… corporate citizen and he are… a… you know, a crap sandwich all year for us. Real I mean so my… my first uh… my second quarter we missed our number by three million. Third quarter we missed our number by four million. All the while everyone's like, "Hey, keep going you're gonna be all right." No… no job loss concern but for me I feel like I'm not being effective. I feel like my team… I… I'm not a big fan of confrontation at all, run from it. I've got three individuals who are very confrontational. 

00:16:05
UNKNOWN I wanna let you know while you're talking I'm building a strategy for you just so I wanna let you know I'm… I'm working for you while you're talking so go ahead awesome. 

00:16:15
ADAM uh… so… I've got these… these three people who are confrontationalists pain in my butt. Uh… Not… not team players. All right, don't see very self-centered uh… in… in their view of the world and not looking at the broader picture which I can understand but… 

00:16:40
UNKNOWN I'm gonna interrupt you now. 

00:16:40
ADAM Yes. 

00:16:40
UNKNOWN Umm… Not because anything you're saying… 

00:16:40
ADAM Yeah. 

00:16:40
UNKNOWN That I wanna… we're gonna… so… What is it that you haven't done around these two first things which is the divorce and or this shift in responsibilities and so forth and being dumped on like that? What… what is it about those that you have not addressed do you think? 

00:17:10
ADAM How do… 

00:17:10
UNKNOWN If anything. 

00:17:10
ADAM How do you mean? 

00:17:15
UNKNOWN Was… are you clear? How are you doing around those two things? You're okay around the how the divorce went down all that kind of stuff and there's that or You how are you doing around this switch? Why didn't… 

00:17:25
ADAM I think I'm better with… 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN In January. 

00:17:30
ADAM Well, I think with the divorce what I'm not okay with is this feeling of uh… "This is not what I wanted my life to be." I didn't want to be a single guy living in a, you know, two-bedroom apartment. Uh… you know, having my kids pulled from place to place uh… that weighs on me considerably. I don't… 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN You know what the motions are that are connected with that? 

00:17:55
ADAM Well there's fear. Umm… 

00:17:55
UNKNOWN Fear of? 

00:18:00
ADAM Fear of uh… creating and you know, children who ultimately are missing out on things that are in my head that… that a normal family should have. 

00:18:10
UNKNOWN So you're afraid (inaudible) some very… 

00:18:10
ADAM Very fearful. Umm… there is fear too umm… a high preponderance of fear associated with my ability to make an income to support my ex-wife who isn't living in a house and has always lived in a house while I have lived in an apartment umm… but I'm so compelled to keep her and the children umm… in some sense of normalcy. Uh… but at the same time I… am uh… I resent the… the position she's put me into because she moved into this house and it basically is my check that I write to her every month and so now I have associated the check with if I don't make that check then… then they're out and if I can't make that check how am I gonna afford my little two-bedroom apartment and so… 

00:19:10
UNKNOWN So what do you think you need to be doing with all that that you're not doing? If anything? 

00:19:15
ADAM Uh… Well… I don't… I don't know but I need to get better at… 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible) you know, actions. 

00:19:25
ADAM I need to get better at cascading from uh… my job to I maybe poor. You know, lose my job and I'm gonna be in the streets. Uh… I know it would never be like that but in my head that's what it'd be like. 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN Oh yeah, in the panic attack that that's what came up, you know, what right. Umm… you were in the bathroom locked in there like, "It's over." 

00:19:45
ADAM yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. 

00:19:45
UNKNOWN So I want (inaudible)… some connection between this and this because I'm gonna say this… set this up and that there's something that is unfinished about this that's gonna help this and here's the other thing I know. I'm old I don't know if you've noticed. I've been… this isn't my first rodeo. What I know about this you know, in time out here back in January. 

00:20:15
ADAMS Right. 

00:20:15
UNKNOWN It represents is you don't have to fix that to take care of what you and I are sitting up here for. You have to see it. 

00:20:25
ADAMS All right. 

00:20:25
UNKNOWN Basically you want to go, "Hey, look unconscious I… I get it." Because …we just have to frame this up consciously where you know, I don't know shit I don't know I mean really what's going on necessarily but we've got to frame it up like my unconscious has signaled to me that something's not right that I was not paying attention to. And here the message we want to give the unconscious who that's working for your betterment. It's working for you in a way that it didn't think you were working. It is going, "Hey Adam, wake up." Right? It's a messenger but the messenger is so ugly you pay attention to the messenger instead of the message. Okay, number one we don't see that that's because it's clumsy at what it does. It can't do this but the other major point I want to say that this is that you don't have to know how to fix this. You have to be able to say, "Thank you, unconscious. I was kind of like clueless about this. I'm awake now…" 

00:21:40
ADAMS Yeah 

00:21:40
UNKNOWN "…and if you wouldn't mind maybe turning down the intensity and the volume I would appreciate that." Right? 

00:21:45
ADAMS Yes. 

00:21:50
UNKNOWN The unconscious needs to know that you're on it. The response you're having now is so primitive. It's not about you it's just the panic stuff is so primitive of an expression you don't have to have that expression in order to address this stuff. So that's the first really big thing that you and I want to get clear. We're gonna do the other stuff but this… this is important for you to go okay the stuff around you know we just went you just told me stuff that needs to get settled here. I… I'm not the one thing you said cascades over and then but I thought there were something like milk toast or something in there that you are also implying about the checks going out and her in the house and you here. Is there something else about that that you're not… 

00:22:45
ADAMS Well, I… 

00:22:45
UNKNOWN …addressing? 

00:22:45
ADAMS …I there is… there is resentment. Uh… But I also have a lot of guilt, you know, for the… the destruction of the marriage. Umm… So I… I in the one sense I feel like it's my bad. I just need to be a big boy and then deal with it… 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN Okay well, maybe well, I get I hear what you're saying but I think you wanna consider that there's a more nuanced set of things to do underneath that and… and not a kind of attitude like well, you know, get over it. It's… it's not… not that, you know what I mean, it's not it's like wait a minute I got to be a big boy about it but which includes I could be responsible that uh… its stuff is coming up inside me and I'm… I'm not listening to it and responding to it, I'm not respecting it. 

00:23:40
ADAMS All right. 

00:23:40
UNKNOWN You know I think you need to respect the resentment and the whatever other feelings that we… you and I may never uncover respect them like some part of me is having those reactions so let me give it some positive space and then figure out as you would say as a big boy. Well, now how do I take care of all of that because you've been injured, right? 

00:24:05
ADAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN I mean you're injured about all that's happened in the divorce. You are injured in a way you know, injured. 

00:24:10
ADAMS Yeah. 

00:24:10
UNKNOWN …Around the switch you're working so forth and so you gonna pay attention to that. So the thing around work so we'll leave the divorce stuff. 

00:24:15
ADAMS Yeah. 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN That was I think enough for me to understand it. Well, what about the work stuff that… that you might have missed if anything? You're not paying attention to in terms of the… I almost called a bait and switch and I don't think that I don't know if that's accurate or not but. 

00:24:35
ADAMS Umm… I don't know I mean I'm… I'm certainly very critical of uh… of myself which never helps uh… in these situations uh… but I also have a uh… feeling of you know if uh… if only they knew, you know, if only they knew the real Adam they'll be like, "Why is this guy (inaudible)? Why is he our director umm… 

00:25:00
UNKNOWN The imposture kind of thing? 

00:25:00
ADAMS Yeah, definitely… definitely uh… and yeah and so what I've always had is great ability to present and to make up for any perceived shortcomings in other areas Adam was guy who'd get up and present and feel confident that he's got his shit together. 

00:25:25
UNKNOWN So what… what you've leaned on is… is I know how to look good. 

00:25:30
ADAMS Right. 

00:25:30
UNKNOWN Is that? 

00:25:30
ADAMS Yeah, yeah. 

00:25:30
UNKNOWN Is that what you're saying? 

00:25:30
ADAMS Yeah. 

00:25:35
UNKNOWN And now all of a sudden you're not looking good. 

00:25:35
ADAMS Right. 

00:25:35
UNKNOWN And you got to look good. 

00:25:40
ADAMS Right. And if I don't have that then whatever I got? 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN Right. So but I want to say to you that this position that you're… like what you're talking about right now when you have this kind of social anxiety you… what happens is the person needs to perform and simultaneously look good, right? 

00:26:05
ADAMS Right. 

00:26:05
UNKNOWN And so that has to change. Sorry. 

00:26:10
ADAMS All right. 

00:26:10
UNKNOWN Do you know what I mean when I say that it has to change? 

00:26:10
ADAMS I'm not sure. 

00:26:15
UNKNOWN You have to give up… 

00:26:15
ADAMS Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:26:15
UNKNOWN …being committed to looking good when you present and that's it all… (inaudible). 

00:26:20
ADAMS Yeah. 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN We'll get into the details of that but I'm just telling you that one of the corner sounds around social anxiety. It's like well I can introduce myself to anybody and as long as I don't have to remember their name and, you know, maybe get a little goofy or make a mistake I can do it you know if I'm being paid at a party to be the class clown or something I can pull that off but if my stance is I got to look good, now I'm gonna interact. I don't want to go. All right? So you're retreating to… you're wanting to retreat… 

00:26:55
ADAMS Right. 

00:27:00
UNKNOWN …Because of this piece around looking good. So we got to talk about that a little bit so I wanna go one more thing around the… the job maybe I'm not understand the job's change so much but I thought there was a like you didn't have a say so. 

00:27:15
ADAMS No. 

00:27:15
UNKNOWN And that kind of changes… 

00:27:15
ADAMS Yeah. 

00:27:15
UNKNOWN …And then it's, you know, it's a burden that on top you now that seems unfair to you. 

00:27:20
ADAMS Well, it's umm… yeah so I didn't have a change so I'm soon in Cancun at our annual events sales event kickoff kind of thing. We're just a (inaudible) and thrown up the slides and uh… the place where I used to be on the little deck uh… my name wasn't there. And I'm like, "Okay, I know I'm not fired but so what does that mean?" 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN Keep coming back to that I wasn't fired, I'm not gonna be fired… 

00:27:50
ADAMS Yeah, yeah. 

00:27:50
UNKNOWN And that you may have to (inaudible) on that one too. 

00:27:50
ADAMS So I, you know, all of a sudden umm… you know, they just threw me over to this guy and you know, it's… it's a weird position because on the surface it looks like promotion uh… because what we did is we carved out the top customers and gave them to me and a counterpart on the East Coast. Top customer big guys spending millions with us. And my team now went from having, you know, like 50 accounts to 5 and… and have created a bunch of problems. So this was… it just felt like the whole thing was written on the back of a cocktail napkin and that Adam will go here. He'll like it and… and they pair me up with his guy. 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN Adams easy. He'll roll with it. 

00:28:45
ADAMS I will. 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:28:45
ADAMS Yeah and… 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN When you say I will you mean that? 

00:28:50
ADAMS I do, I do… 

00:28:50
UNKNOWN How's that working for you? 

00:28:55
ADAMS Uh… Up until… up until. 

00:28:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible) there I am. 

00:28:55
ADAMS Yeah, yeah. 

00:28:55
UNKNOWN That's the last piece that I don't wanna say about that. It's that I think it's not just, you know, there… these things but there's something else. 

00:29:00
ADAMS Right. 

00:29:05
UNKNOWN There is another reaction inside you besides… 

00:29:05
ADAMS Right. 

00:29:10
UNKNOWN And… what is the other, what other emotional reactions you have about it all? You were afraid? 

00:29:15
ADAMS Oh, yeah. I was afraid. 

00:29:15
UNKNOWN Push the fear away and… and what are you left with in terms of your response to what changed. 

00:29:20
ADAMS Uh… Mad. 

00:29:25
UNKNOWN Mad really? 

00:29:25
ADAMS Not… 

00:29:25
UNKNOWN Tell me what do you mean… 

00:29:25
ADAMS Not included in the process. 

00:29:30
UNKNOWN But tell me about being… what do you mean mad? I mean… 

00:29:30
ADAMS Overlooked. 

00:29:35
UNKNOWN But how do you know you're mad? 

00:29:35
ADAMS Umm… I don't know. 

00:29:35
UNKNOWN I mean is that all fury for you or do you… 

00:29:40
ADAMS Yeah, I mean I don't know if I was pissed off I will… well I felt vulnerable which I… 

00:29:45
UNKNOWN Invulnerable. 

00:29:45
ADAMS I guess that's… that it wouldn't be anger as much as fear. 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN So if we push that away what's left? What would you say theoretically so what do you think about being mad? Or you… or you tune didn't so speak to that feeling? Or is it just a logical feeling you have? 

00:30:10
ADAMS (inaudible). 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible) like storm away? 

00:30:15
ADAMS No, not at all because that's not what I do. I roll with it. I figure they will… uh… they will take care of me. 

00:30:25
UNKNOWN So unconscious in there going, "Adam you missing, you missing something." All right? 

00:30:35
ADAMS Yeah. 

00:30:35
UNKNOWN And then the buzzes throws you into a panic. So my job right now is to be… put voice on the unconscious that is clumsy we're trying to translate it into something… 

00:30:45
ADAMS Right. 

00:30:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible) get. And so I'm saying gently wake up about umm… that you have a more complex set of feelings and you can't really rest on the laurels of Adam rolls with it and I… I think that… I'm laying out just a piece of work now there is a piece of work to be done around that again over time and it doesn't have to be fixed before we get all this kind of stuff. It just you need to address that. Will that be ok with you? 

00:31:15
ADAMS Oh, okay. 

00:31:20
UNKNOWN Were you concerned about having that part of you available to the world? You… 

00:31:25
ADAMS No, I mean so the… the therapist I was working with now uh… there's a… there's a big thing my… so my boss who I now needed to report to who's my boss's boss was in uh… the UK and my boss had a standing call with him at 7:30 in the morning on Mondays. I'm like, "Thank you for that freaking call because I've got kids, my kids." You know, I have Monday Tuesday and every other weekend and so now I… I've got to deal with my kids and God forbid I asked this guy to move the call so I didn't. I was, you know, I was sitting there in my… in my bedroom kids are watching TV and I'm stressing out over this freaking call but uh… therapist was like, "Why didn't you ask for a new time?" Like I don't know. I wouldn't… I wouldn't dare do that. That's crazy. 

00:32:15
UNKNOWN Okay, okay. So… so she's on… she's on the right (inaudible). 

00:32:20
ADAMS Right, right. So I am open to that. 

00:32:20
UNKNOWN Okay and so that's… so we got that. 

00:32:20
ADAMS Right. 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN I'm gonna go and we're gonna leave that behind now let's just talk about what's now the current all of physical sensations and all that kind of stuff. 

00:32:30
ADAMS Right. 

00:32:30
UNKNOWN Umm… To what degree are you (inaudible) anything now? And also second question is there anything else you're avoiding besides if you're avoiding anything? Is there anything else that you're concerned about besides just giving a presentation? 

00:32:45
ADAMS No, I mean that's where the most acute, umm… you know, issue. 

00:32:50
UNKNOWN Is it showing up anywhere else even if it's an acute? (inaudible) fear I'm gonna loose (inaudible). 

00:32:55
ADAMS Only a… so it's never anything outside of conversation so whether it's conversation, interview, I mean I could feel whenever umm… if I'm getting into maybe an emotional discussion with a friend. I'll feel this is similar you know, similar feelings inside. 

00:33:15
UNKNOWN Let's describe. Describe those. 

00:33:15
ADAMS The tightness, the butterflies, the (inaudible), the little bit of shortness of breath… 

00:33:20
UNKNOWN And then what happens up here when you start noticing those? 

00:33:25
ADAMS Well (inaudible) now I'm like, "Dude, you're talking to your friend." 

00:33:30
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:33:30
ADAMS "Calm down." 

00:33:30
UNKNOWN What the hell is wrong with you? (inaudible) get real. That's got nothing to worry about. 

00:33:35
ADAMS But I go through the same like, "Oh my God, is this happening? Right now, really? With it, you know, with this person? What?" I mean it's… 

00:33:45
UNKNOWN Okay, timeout. Let me just make sure I heard what you said so I got the part (inaudible) goes, "Uh oh, is this really gonna happen right now?" And then I got another voice that goes, "Dude, what the hell is wrong with you?" 

00:33:55
ADAMS Right. 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN "…this is nothing," right? Are those two voices you hear kind of? 

00:34:00
ADAMS Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:34:00
UNKNOWN You've got any other ones at that moment? 

00:34:05
ADAMS Umm… 

00:34:05
UNKNOWN Is there… 

00:34:05
ADAMS No, I mean there's… 

00:34:05
UNKNOWN Can we add one? 

00:34:05
UNKNOWN …there's uh… well, I don't know how many people were talking in their (inaudible) seems like there's a lot against me but… but, you know, a couple of them… 

00:34:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible) that comment is on the right track. 

00:34:15
ADAMS Couple of (inaudible) just take a deep breath (inaudible) keep this in perspective. This is not gonna kill you. This is not brain surgery. This is your name. You know, let's just does deal with that. I then pulled my uh… 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN Okay, so let me just say that so that side of you that's coming up with saying that is you have the right… idea but it's probab… I'm gonna get saying the wrong things to you but we'll come back to that… 

00:34:45
ADAMS Oh, but I do have, you know, the voices that are saying all the wrong things to me that… 

00:34:50
UNKNOWN But you got any right things? 

00:34:55
ADAMS (inaudible) Well yeah, I mean umm… going into the last one uh… like people like me right, I mean people generally like me and… and I've never… I'm not confrontational so I'm never pissing anyone off usually. Uh… And so all of my experiences have never been negative, right? And regardless of so this one shouldn't be. 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:35:20
ADAMS I've never had a bad presentation… 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN Okay, here's the mistake you're making. 

00:35:25
ADAMS Yep. 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN What do I know you? 

00:35:30
ADAMS You're the expert. 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN Umm… You're saying do you have no reason to be scared and that's not the right thing to say. The thing to say is this makes totally good sense that you're feeling this way right now that you start there is don't discount how scared you suddenly finding yourself to the right that's kind of an observer comment. You've got to, you know, you're finding yourself being suddenly scared and it makes sense. 

00:36:05
ADAMS Yeah. 

00:36:05
UNKNOWN That's happened. 

00:36:05
ADAMS First… 

00:36:05
UNKNOWN Go ahead. 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN I think I've had some of those comments in… in my head right uh… it's okay to be nervous. Nervous makes you perform better. 

00:36:15
UNKNOWN This is more than (inaudible). 

00:36:15
ADAMS But I wasn't committed, I wasn't committed. 

00:36:20
UNKNOWN But this is also more than nervous because you're not sure if you're gonna fall off the cliff. 

00:36:25
ADAMS Right. 

00:36:25
UNKNOWN You don't know how dramatic it's about to get so… so you wanna lock down the part that's you know I'm adding some things around what happened, you know, four months before the first one and then now we've got, you know, the other way that the amygdale, the mind is gonna work is gonna be any reasonable facsimile of those events that have already been terrible for you. It's going to go into gear up for you. It… it gives you false positives and the reason that gives you false positives like, you know, something's bad at right now is because it thinks that it dropped the ball You're up giving the presentation, it's giving you what it thinks is in hindsight false negatives. It saying, "Everything's fine boss nothing to be worried about." And then boom you had trouble. So it flips over and goes, "I'm sorry. I let you down and apologize and but I'm on it now I'm not gonna let you miss anything like that again. I'm gonna… but you're gonna have a number of false-positives because I'm on guard for you. I'm gonna make up." So we wanna think about a little bit that's what your brain is doing. It made a mistake by not knowing that there was something that was gonna happen. Something happen and now any reasonable facsimile is gonna give potentially give you a little rise and you wanna go, "Okay, yeah all right." 

00:38:10
ADAMS Yeah. 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN So and then there's so we're… we're good with that idea? 

00:38:10
ADAMS Yeah. 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN Okay. And then there's transparency, then there's vulnerability and here's the other thing that happens that gives people trouble, "I can't let people know". All right? 

00:38:25
ADAMS Yeah. 

00:38:25
UNKNOWN So as soon as I go into that stance then I've added a second problem. 

00:38:30
ADAMS All right. 

00:38:30
UNKNOWN I'm not feeling good or unaware know where this is going, I got to keep it hidden from the people around me. And then you double down with another big juice of adrenaline and now you're feeling even worse. So of course that work when you given up I mean you did great. Just saying, you know, I've got food poisoning got to go but then you know you burn whatever your expression was "burned that match already" 

00:39:00
ADAMS Yeah. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN I like that. That was good. you know, let me (inaudible). Does your boss who's close to you know what's going on? 

00:39:05
ADAMS I had a conversation with him last week and I shared with him what I was going through. 

00:39:10
UNKNOWN So that's a good thing. I mean… 

00:39:10
ADAMS Oh, yeah. 

00:39:10
UNKNOWN …If he's a safe enough person that… 

00:39:15
ADAMS Oh, he is safe. But I feel… I feel like you didn't get it. He didn't understand. 

00:39:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's a problem too. 

00:39:20
ADAMS yeah like I… I… I shared I… I… I …told him, he's like… 

00:39:25
UNKNOWN He knows now. 

00:39:25
ADAMS He knows now. 

00:39:25
UNKNOWN He gets it or not you broke through that fourth wall so to speak and he knows. Did that do any, so you got a little like, "I don't know if he got it." But it is… but you not even know whether it helps for them saying, I think that that helps. 

00:39:40
ADAMS Oh, definitely if it's safer. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible) your friend (inaudible) going if depending on your, you know, concentric circles of intimacy to the degree there in here I'm gonna suggest that you break it at that point to you go "Man I…", you know, if you can tell the story you know, to the people it's panic attacks. You know it's not that, you know, it's like being… fear speaking is the number one fear in the world. So they'll understand it. You had this weird feeling is it's kind of going on right now it's really weird I (inaudible) reasonable facsimile incomes. Quote me any reasonable facsimile of that event and it start happens happening right now. And you watch what happens to you when you start doing that. That's gonna… I'm gonna predict that's gonna make a difference to you in those kinds of circumstances. Okay? Now let's go to these places where it's more formal so are you back and out of anything? 

00:40:40
ADAMS Well, I'll tell you it is a real… a real story. There's a meeting next Tuesday. My rep called me emailed me and said, Adam I need you to cover. I was like, "holy shit." 

00:40:50
UNKNOWN Wait a minute… 

00:40:50
ADAMS I'm not ready yet, I'm… I just started my work I'll be ready in a month. I mean Dr. Wilson umm… you know, I got my I'm getting too old… 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN He didn't say that. 

00:41:00
ADAMS No, but I'm like in my head I'm like, "No way, I'll be good in like six weeks but I can't do it Tuesday." So I like absolutely create… created a trip. I can't be there. I'll get someone to backfill. I can't be there. So I have thought about it and umm… I am going to confront it but with some support. Umm… I've sort of taken off the pressure of the presentation but I still very much need to be in the room which I feel as a positive move forward. So I am gonna be in…in the… 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN So can you handle being in the room? That means… 

00:41:45
ADAMS I'm gonna have to. 

00:41:45
UNKNOWN Well now, what am I asking you? 

00:41:50
ADAMS No, right now, now I don't want to be in the room. I wanna be on a plane going to San Jose. 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN But no I mean but let's go back in real, you know, and what are your concerns that might legitimately what do you concern about in that meeting? In room how do you feel like you might be vulnerable just doing that? 

00:42:10
ADAMS Well, I mean my last uh… so attack or I mean in my… the attack occurred, you know, the attack or the uncomfortable you know, session or of time uh… was probably an hour. Really intense for 20 minutes but four hours before that I'm waking up at Four with that on my head. Right so… so there's all of that and this was two weeks ago week and half ago. And so all of that is super fresh and uh… so what I'm afraid of is embarrassment. 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN By having what occur? 

00:42:50
ADAMS By having a repeat performances staggering through, I mean, I never in wildest imagination thought I would have a tough time saying my name and my role. That demon like registered. 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN Okay so timeout. So first off whatever's gonna happen on Tuesday you have to be… have to sorry to say it that way but anyway you have to have a contingency for every bad thing you imagine is going to happen. You need to have a plan about how you're going to respond to that. You're not gonna grit your teeth, you know, buckled down and… and push through it as the answer "I don't think." So even though you and I may not work on that all of those right now you have to do that, "Oh, how am I gonna what happens if I really get these symptoms and I got to get up and leave. How… how do I handle that? Is there anything I need to say (inaudible) to bail out." All of that stuff you should problem-solve because it's not going to work in my opinion what do I know it by going well you know if I get a number six, you know, level of panic I… I've got it. Hope to God I don't get an eight because I'll you know, eight would be awful. It doesn't work that way if you think I can handle a number six, you know, scale to ten or something but I can't handle number eight because you have this intolerance of uncertainty about this circumstance you can't say I'm not having a number eight and so your unconscious is going to work for your betterment by going, "better be careful number eight could be coming." And then there it is. You got to have in your back pocket what you'll do in that moment if you need it that will give you some relief. You won't like that, you have to you don't want to do those things but you have to know what you would do. Is that different than how you're thinking about it? 

00:45:00
ADAMS No, I… I… I agree uh… but when I get in… in… in that and I was thinking when I get in there I have no control. I feel like I have to control. 

00:45:10
UNKNOWN You mean when things start coming. 

00:45:10
ADAMS Yeah, it's like is someone's hijacks every nerve in my body and it's on Red Bull and it's you know heart is just like… like I can hear it. 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN And then what are you going to do if that happens on Tuesday? 

00:45:30
ADAMS Right… right now, I just suffered through it. I mean that's… that is my, you know, I don't have… well I've got this rubber band now that I can… I'll be clicking, you know and taking deep breath. 

00:45:45
UNKNOWN Okay, so you need some work about that. (inaudible) that's it's insufficient to give you the ego strength to go through it. You got to be able to tolerate looking bad there we go, right? Like you're gonna tough… tough through it I don't… I mean you may very well do that. That's great I mean if you jump through that it's great but ahead of time you got to get if you know, if the worst case scenario happens this is what I'm gonna do. 

00:46:15
ADAMS Right, and I just don't have an understanding of uh… you know in my world it's either you're on or you're off and I don't know what it looks like in between those two places. 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN Okay but that's your work and do you really have to go on Tuesday? You really have to do it? 

00:46:35
ADAMS I do because I wanna get over this. 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN Well, yeah but you're not… 

00:46:35
ADAMS I don't have to go, no. 

00:46:40
UNKNOWN You don't have to be the therapist here. You're… you're trying to tell yourself what the treatment is. And so the treatment I'm gonna use is I'm gonna tough through it and I… I don't know that that's the right answer. 

00:46:50
ADAMS I think I would phrase it more as I'm trying to confront it as opposed to muscling through it but what I feel like is gonna happen is I'm gonna end up muscling through it. 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN Okay, and again I'm not going to be arguing with you at this which is I hear you and you also say, "I don't know how the heck I'm going to do that." And so because you don't know how the heck you're going to do that the… the attitude of I'm going is doesn't have a lot of weight to it. So it is say that to you, right? You… so the next thing I think we ought to be thinking about is where is your anger? Can you get a hold of it? Is there a way to be more aggressive in… in your sense of self because I would take, you know, there's two ways you can take on both of these things we'll just call this panic. That we're going to use both these things. I got to take care of myself when this is happening and I don't wanna start to begin to have an attitude of "Is that the best you got?" to it, right? I can handle this so you've got to have a statement of, "I can handle this." You need to really have that, "I can handle this." You can't mal those words and so to the degree you can, you know, wrap your mind around "Whatever happens I'm gonna handle it." That's a very important message that you're not ready to say yet. Is that fair to say? 

00:48:30
ADAMS It is fair. 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN So that's… that's part of your work which is to get to a place where you can stand behind the message, "whatever happens I can handle it," all right? So once you got that then you're gonna have a little better job about going, "Come out, really? only got what 90 beats per minute, is that all you got? Can you… you know, can you… can me get me up to 120 beats a minute before I start talking man? Read's gonna put a gold coin in the my safe deposit box. He promised Come on," all right? So I know that sounds insane but I literally work with people doing that kind of thing you… you know, "Whatever you give me I'm gonna handle and come on." So no matter how bad you're feeling it's not bad enough, all right? So… umm… so what do you think about this whole attitude disposition about talking about talking to panic. Backfill that if you want but what's reaction when you hear it? 

00:49:45
ADAMS No, I… yeah I would say I don't have a strength in that but I think I mean I agree that that's that seems like a direction that I need to embrace. 

00:49:55
UNKNOWN Because your automatic response is gonna be "Uh oh." My automatic response would be, "uh oh," all right so we're not we're not in control of that immediate response just like you're not in control of this starting to come when you're just talking to your friend but you got to you know up… up front you may have some things you want to say and then when it starts showing up you want to be able to take care yourself in some ways like I can… I'll get through this and do I need to say anything to them right now? You can… you got to kind of have to not have the panic be the voice that you hear but one that's just behind it to go, "Okay, uh oh, okay well this is…" you're not gonna get rid of "uh oh" everybody reacts "uh oh" and then you try to get a grip on things. So you want to be able to take care yourself if you're able to get this attitude around, "Okay, I'm tired of being intimidated by these symptoms" and you begin to have an attitude of, "give me more please" umm… right that is a voice that is opposite of what sustains the panic because panic gives you symptoms and then needs you to resist them and that's what everybody does and that's how they get stuck. So when you can… realize I'm not in control the symptoms popping up but I am in control of how I respond to them when they go and I got to have a kind of permissive response to it I may not look good now. So you have to risk this or the other thing, right? You've to risk not looking that good. I'm talking and there's you know I can feel the blood draining out of my face uh… heck but I'll do it anyway. Now you know, physiologically if you are having what we would call them (inaudible) response that means what that is, is your heart rate shoots up and then it drops immediately and then people tend to get close to what we would call a syncopy episode where they black out not that it ever happened to you of course but you know that experience so if you start feeling, you know, some of the stuff that you are describing you can just start (inaudible) things up. Just take just squeeze your fists and maybe tighten your muscles if you can in your legs and your arms and what that is about is that you're increasing your blood pressure. Blood pressure has to drop for you to like, you know, go out like that so you may feel terrible but you know at least you don't have to start going, "What if I blacked out." Because if you're like this yeah and that's not gonna happen. So I'm gonna stop and have you asked me questions about the specifics of how you gonna do what you're gonna do and all that kind of stuff. So I don't just keep talking at you. What do you got so far? What would you be… cause you and I are gonna have two more contacts, Skype or FaceTime or phone or something whenever you want to schedule them with me other than before Tuesday. You're on your own (inaudible) What do you got so far… 

00:53:20
ADAMS So what kind of things can I be doing prior to sitting in the chair being in the room? To… you know, to bolster my… my confidence and… 

00:53:30
UNKNOWN What do you want to be confident in? 

00:53:35
ADAMS Well, I mean, I guess I need to be confident myself that would be the uh… 

00:53:40
UNKNOWN Well go back what you want to be confident in is, "Whatever happens I'll handle it." But if you're asking me right now it should be a totally understandable question that I can be more confident that this won't happen again you don't get that. That's off the table. Sorry I suck at what I do. That's… it's… that's bad form. We don't want to go on tour (inaudible) again. I totally get why you're asking that. I'd asked the same thing too but I think you need to take that off the table because to the degree you start going now I need confidence that that's not gonna happen again that what… what you're saying to your amygdala is, "Danger please juice me up." Right? That's all it hears and so you got to adopt an attitude that doesn't say to your amygdale, "Danger juice me up." So when you use the word confidence that's not really what's going on you're going, "I want more certainty. I'm not gonna suffer again." All right? I'll just say one more time the amygdala doesn't hear any message other than "Danger please protect me." So to the degree you can go, "I got this, if I have trouble I won't like that but I got that too." That you want to do work, that's where you go nail. Not, "How do I get rid of this?" but what's… what's my orientation to get me strong again and so I'm giving you the taste around got to build up a little bit about my, you know, the best defense is a good offence or is that the right expression? Or say you want an off, you wanna bring the game to the disorder. Not be responding constantly the… you know, backing up and to say, "I need confidence" is feeding right into it. It loves hearing that. It's like, "Yes!" right? Does this make any sense what I'm saying. And I sorry I mean I'm sorry that you have, you know, the risk that you'd be embarrassed and all that stuff but go ahead.

ADAMS Well, it's just uh… I mean this isn't anything new. It's just frustrating that uh… it is still me. 

00:56:15
UNKNOWN Tell me what… tell me what. 

00:56:15
ADAMS Well, that I am uh… on one side I'm… I'm working hard to respond to issues and doubts and fears that has been generated by the other side of me and that is the frustrating umm… part where I just feel like I'm failing myself. 

00:56:35
UNKNOWN I think you're that you're not being afraid of yourself when you say that because you've got circumstances that have occurred and… and they're special, you know, you've had a tremendous loss around your relationship with your children's I mean I… I remember when I was leaving one of these conferences sitting in the airport at in Phoenix. Coming to the realization that either I'm going to stay in an empty marriage or I was going to lose my kids have time and I was wailing, wailing. I'm sure people thought I was on the way to the funeral. You've been so you know I've been where you are now and have been and something has happened to you so I don't want you to you should not perceive yourself like that, right? You don't have the skills yet to manage something this dramatic but you will. You are gonna be in good hands and then you and I gonna do some follow-up. We're gonna stop in a minute umm… and think because of time but so I want to just invite you see if there's another anything else you want to ask or… 

00:57:55
ADAMS No, no. 

00:57:55
UNKNOWN Sorry I'm not giving you what you imagined you were gonna get. But I think this is the right advice to you.
