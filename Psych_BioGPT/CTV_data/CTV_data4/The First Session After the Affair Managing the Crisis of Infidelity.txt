Arielle & Dominic 

00:00:20
ELLYN BADER Hello and thank you for joining us. I'm Ellyn Bader and this is my husband Dr. Peter Pearson. Today, you're going to see, the first session of a couple who came in the aftermath of infidelity. The couple was referred to us by one of our associates at the Couple's Institute. All we knew when we sat down with them, was that they had lived together and worked together, and been a committed couple for four years. As therapist, when you work with complex relationship problems, what you first see is not what you get, as you come to know the couple and explore the issues. So now, you know, what we knew of Arielle and Dominic. 

00:01:05
PETER PEARSON What would make our meeting today worthwhile for each of you, individually? Yet, that could have happened. What would make each of you say, "whoa, we were there, today?" 

00:01:15
DOMINIC I don't know, obviously we're here for a reason. We definitely going through a rough patch. Umm… there's definitely a lot of underlying issues, I've had a few indiscretions or infidelities, umm… and cheated on her a few times and I'm going to therapy, you hear the other person's feelings, you hear what they're saying, but it's completely different to remind yourself of those every day. 

00:01:45
ELLYN BADER Would you like to be when able to? 

00:01:45
DOMINIC Yeah, but it's just always so difficult to uh… to sort of apply that. 

00:01:50
PETER PEARSON Today, we will find a way to help you address that, challenge that, Prices you're talking about, I think we can address that with more clarity? And help you get more in alignment with how you inspire to be if you come from higher yourself? I think we can do that today. Will be useful for you, Arielle. 

00:02:15
ARIELLE I think that I would like to walk away with maybe an understanding of why he cheats? Is it because umm… he's not in love with me? Is it because, yup, or is it… not supposed to be together or I mean, I'm just kind of like and un… unsure umm… of the why? And I know don't really think it will stop until, I knew that, like I don't think like he can't say to me, I'll never cheat on you again, I'll never been faithful to you again, 'cause he doesn't even know why he does it, right? Or understand it, I guess? The previous two times I was very willing to umm… kind of let my guard down again. Umm… and like more open and I think, my first reaction is anger, it's always been like if I'm really, really hurt. I just get angry 'cause it's kind of like, I'm not gonna allow to hurt me like this, I'm not gonna show you that I'm hurt. I'm not gonna show you that vulnerable and I'm sad. So I'm just gonna be really angry. And umm… I think that, this time I've like kind of, umm… just… and like my walls are so up that I just don't even like I don't even understand 'cause I don't understand why, so I don't under… like how could I, how could I move path that's and try to move forward if I don't even know that why, why you did what you did, and I'm just going to like allow you to hurt me again in that way, like I just I'm so barded right now. 

00:03:55
ELLYN BADER So you know you're really protecting yourself? 

00:04:00
ARIELLE Yeah, I mean, yeah. 

00:04:00
PETER PEARSON So you have a real incurred to struggle, within yourself? 

00:04:05
ARIELLE Yeah, I mean part of me like umm… like loves him, wanna marry him and have kids with him so I'm away from them, so. There's a part of me it's like I'm the surface, why abuse myself? I don't make fool out myself. 

00:04:25
PETER PEARSON Yeah. Yeah. You're… 

00:04:25
ARIELLE Continually. Continuously. 

00:04:30
PETER PEARSON Yeah. Yeah, that being torn between those two opposing energies and emotions, I want and I'm afraid of. 

00:04:40
ELLYN BADER Yeah. They have been equaled. 

00:04:45
PETER PEARSON Please don't cry. What are the emotions as you talk this? 

00:04:45
ARIELLE I mean, I'm sad obviously like I've just felt like is it ending. I don't know what, to like I don't want this. I feel like kind of numb, but kind of like… I don't know. I didn't see this happening, I felt like in a minute, like just everything switched. 

00:05:05
ELLYN BADER So you were kind of, you were moving forward making plans to get married, hoping to be married? 

00:05:10
ARIELLE Yeah. And we, we uh… we said we'd be engaged before our anniversy. Uh… it's not and then said we'd be engaged by then so. It's little painful. I don't want him to live with like what are you doing? Who are you with? You know, I don't wanna be a warden I don't wanna live like that. Umm… And I can't understand the why or why he does what he does 'cause he doesn't know what he does, so I don't know how like to past it and I think that he won't continue it. I don't wanna be in an open relationship so, I mean. 

00:05:45
Arielle's Problem 

00:05:50
ARIELLE I have been very committed my whole life, it's been almost too much subject around, our relationship. It's every decision I made, everything I did was for us and for our future, and for our relationship. Our friends are so unmatched. Our families are so unmatched, We're doing business together. We, umm… we live together, you know, and homed together, like we… 

00:06:10
ELLYN BADER So everything was joint, everything was so… 

00:06:10
ARIELLE Pretty into, yeah, it's very, very joint us, you know, that's almost like I mean, there four plus years, I mean, it feels like, you know, it's unmarriaged but feels very sad. 

00:06:25
PETER PEARSON Uh-huh… Then downside of too much togetherness is what? We're too much in joint, what's the downside of organizing too much of your life, around the couple, etcetera, etcetera what's the downside of that? 

00:06:35
ARIELLE I was placing my self-worth on what he taught me. It's not feeling sexy, it's not feeling, I just wonder if I wasn't enough like, you know, which is all the time. So, I think that's on me, right, I think. 

00:06:55
ELLYN BADER Kind of like you've let yourself be robbed? 

00:07:00
ARIELLE Yeah. I mean, I was a very confident person, I was today feel umm… I don't know, just was confident. When, some, when you're so enough for someone I need, are unfaithful to you, is like rock side confidence. 

00:07:15
ELLYN BADER How did you find out about the infidelity? 

00:07:15
ARIELLE After he cheats, he gets meaning. So like I can always tell like he'll cheat on me, and then he'll get very, very angry. 'cause he's trying to look, create something that doesn't exist and I'm like whoa! 

00:07:30
DOMINIC No. I don't think I'm trying to create something that doesn't exist. I think I realize, you know, and what I've done, you know, reflective anger I think, umm… is weird as this sounds I think it's difficult to the cheater. Uh… you know, you wear it, you have to look in the mirror and you have to just… 

00:07:55
ELLYN BADER So is it, fair say you're mad at yourself? And you've felt a lot of shame too? 

00:08:05
ARIELLE He felt so much shame and so much guilt that it over shadows in my opinion. And I just feel bad for him. I'm feeling bad for you, can you just like put once just like… 

00:08:20
ELLYN BADER Create some space to feel that from you… 

00:08:20
ARIELLE Feel for me, yeah. Like. 

00:08:25
DOMINIC Yeah. It's tough. 

00:08:30
ELLYN BADER So you're both in a lot of pain, in different way, each of you. It's hard to make space when create space. To figure out how to deal with it each of your pain separately? 

00:08:40
ARIELLE But I'm moving on, yeah. 

00:08:45
DOMINIC Obviously, I've had a lot of time to think about this, but it's just like the shockwaves just keep coming. Everyday I kind of realize something new that I've done to negatively impact her. So it's just, uh… hard to deal with. 

00:09:05
Dominic's History 

00:09:10
DOMINIC Obviously, a lot of my, umm… indiscretions and, you know, selfishness and things of that nature. Stem from by background a little bit umm… 

00:09:25
[sil.] 

00:09:30
ARIELLE His dad committed suicide… uh… in front of a train. And I think like, I can't imagine what's that like uh… and I think a lot of like, me forgiving him, 'cause I feel bad for him, you know, like… 

00:10:00
ELLYN BADER You care, you care a lot of him… you really care. 

00:10:05
ARIELLE And, I feel perfect for him, you know, I just… I wish he didn't do that to him. 

00:10:15
PETER PEARSON He could just walk in front of a train? 

00:10:15
DOMINIC Yeah. 

00:10:15
PETER PEARSON How old are you when that happened? 

00:10:20
DOMINIC Uh… 20. Almost. 

00:10:20
ELLYN BADER And how old are you now? 

00:10:20
DOMINIC 29. 

00:10:25
ELLYN BADER Whoa! It's that's not long ago. 

00:10:30
DOMINIC Yeah. I hadn't talk to him for like three years before he did that. 

00:10:35
ELLYN BADER Had you cut him off? 

00:10:35
DOMINIC Yeah, I think my last words were eat shit or fuck you or something like that. 

00:10:45
PETER PEARSON What a pain behind that expression now? 

00:10:45
ELLYN BADER You were mad at him. You know, what? 

00:10:45
DOMINIC Yeah. 

00:10:50
PETER PEARSON Yeah. A lot of pain behind that one. 

00:10:55
DOMINIC Yeah. My dad had an affair on my mom, uh… and uh… married the woman that he had the affair with. In my whole life grown up, she hated me. Uh… she uh… 

00:11:10
ELLYN BADER She's your step mother, step mom? 

00:11:15
DOMINIC Yeah. So finally when I got old enough, I kind of understood what was going, when I was about 15 or 16. Uh… like I had uh… you know, I could see what was going on uh… so I told to him kind of fuck you for pretty much, when this happened. Uh… and then uh… 

00:11:40
ELLYN BADER Was the fuck you, fuck you for? 

00:11:45
DOMINIC Kind of taking her side uh… and then I got into a lot of trouble in High School and went to jail for a year and uh… he, I didn't to talk him for a year and then he just showed up at my sentencing and umm… and then when they gave me the uh… you know, then half or many months or whatever that year, they were just like bail have take us about and then he's just like walked then on. And then I got out of jail and went to college completely fucked my life around. Uh… was doing really good in school and then uh… my mom just called me, on like on Friday. She was like hey! Uh… I'm here, where are you and I was like why the fuck did you drive over, over here? Uh… then umm… yeah, she just came and told me what happened. But, it's like I didn't, it's just doesn't seem fair to her, all right for, you know, this kind of shit too. I mean, it's no excuse for taking her feeling, little emotions, trampling him. 

00:13:20
ELLYN BADER Think, can't believe what you said in the beginning, there's a party that wants to understand yourself better. Doesn't like being in the kind of pain you're in, kind of force in, kind of pain that she's in? 

00:13:30
DOMINIC Specially, if like all this shit with my dad and, you know, all that stuff it's like. It's hard enough for me and then just the fact that like I let it spill over into her life, kind of. 

00:13:45
ELLYN BADER You know, you said a few minutes ago, that you're afraid of commitment and I wonder if it's a few things, I mean, I wonder if it's is, is a that there's a problem that wants to commit and another part it's absolutely terrified of the repercussions if you do? 

00:14:05
DOMINIC Yeah. Yeah. 

00:14:05
ELLYN BADER And you're aware of those two part. And aware of them pushing and pulling on you? 

00:14:10
DOMINIC Really. 

00:14:15
ELLYN BADER Are you okay for couple of minutes to do a bit of dialogue between those two part of yourself? 

00:14:20
DOMINIC Hope so. Like stepping outside of myself. 

00:14:25
PETER PEARSON We all have competing alter egos. There's one part of me that wants to get into good shape, you know, for a lot of good reasons that is another part of me that wants to indulge. Yeah, I know that I'll figure that in Jerry's. There is one part of me that wants to stay for the future and another part of me wants to spend right now, so we all have these different alter egos that compete different a set of interests uh… etcetera. So having a dialogue sometimes can make this clear. So the alter ego that says I'm interested in making a greater commitment. Why would that part of you be interested in making a greater commitment? 

00:15:05
DOMINIC To you know, uh… fully indulge in all the, uh… positive aspects of life like, you know, having this all marriage, having, having kids, having, you know, all those good things. 

00:15:20
ELLYN BADER So you have an image of good things, run aside of you that wants to commit? 

00:15:25
DOMINIC Yeah. 

00:15:25
PETER PEARSON And creating things that you missed out on growing up, it would be nice to pass that on? Okay. And the other reason for making a commitment? 

00:15:35
DOMINIC Being in love. 

00:15:40
PETER PEARSON Uh… I didn't prompt that okay? Just F. Y. I, Arielle, that was just spontaneous uh… expression. Why else, Dominic, why else would the commitment be good? 

00:15:55
DOMINIC For the sake of committing of something.. 

00:15:55
PETER PEARSON For the sake committing to something? That means this party longs to feel this kind of … commitment to really throw yourself into something? And the advantage of that would be what? 

00:16:15
DOMINIC I think it builds character. 

00:16:15
PETER PEARSON It does enhance one of the character for that part of yourself. 

00:16:20
DOMINIC Yeah. 

00:16:20
ELLYN BADER In this case, it's committing to a person. It's committing to a future. It's… 

00:16:30
DOMINIC Showing like, they hate that showing uh… shows a lot of, you know, all those things your parents tell you about. 

00:16:40
ELLYN BADER And when you think about a lot of those things they, you just said like, being able to have that kind of commitment. What do you imagine feeling about yourself? 

00:16:50
DOMINIC I would feel accomplished. 

00:16:55
ELLYN BADER You would feel accomplished? 

00:16:55
DOMINIC Yeah. I'd feel like I would set up my lineage, you know, my kids, set them on right track.. 

00:17:05
ELLYN BADER So it's a solid, good… 

00:17:05
DOMININC Yeah. 

00:17:05
PETER PEARSON Something… 

00:17:05
ELLYN BADER centered kind of feeling. 

00:17:10
DOMINIC Yeah, I used to see my friends, family and some stuff like that. When I was a little kid. It is much different. 

00:17:20
ELLYN BADER And did you kind of envy that one? 

00:17:20
DOMINIC Yeah. 

00:17:25
ELLYN BADER Yeah. So when you were little like that was their part of you that even wished that some day you could grow up and create that? 

00:17:30
DOMINIC Yeah. 

00:17:35
ELLYN BADER So you watched and you looked and you notice too? 

00:17:35
DOMINIC But, then like growing up and doing it, it's a different story. 

00:17:40
ELLYN BADER Oh, it's a lot harder. When you sit there, and you remember what you wanted as a child and you think about that feeling, of feeling accomplished in that sense of, yeah, I'm setting up my lineage. What do you feel when you think about all the things are on that side? 

00:18:05
DOMINIC Proud… of just the idea. I mean, I don't know, it's like puffing out your chest. 

00:18:10
PETER PEARSON Now. Come over here, sit in this chair. I wanna talk to your… you're other alter ego. Come over here and sit in this chair. So. The alter ego over there was talking about here all the advantages of, of making a commitment being in a committed relationship and over there there's a sense of pride and integrity that alter ego of Dominic says, "Here are the advantages of commitment." Over here is this is why I shy away from commitment. What would this guy say over here? Commitment sounds good, but… 

00:18:45
DOMINIC It's just fucked up. Umm… I don't know what it would say, but it just reverts back to selfishness, I think. 

00:18:50
ELLYN BADER Did you watch your father being selfish and doing what he wanted? 

00:18:55
DOMINIC No. I don't. He had a lot of that, but when I was old enough my mom let me know that, you know, this is probably the right time to tell you, but uh… I kind of asked though. I kind of asked, about my step mom and she was like yeah, he had an affair with her. And then I thought whoa! Was he unhappy with my mom, and then uh… I saw him really unhappy in his current relationship and I don't know, I think that all just kind of fucked my… 

00:19:25
ELLYN BADER The part of you that makes it okay to be with another girl or woman at some times, the three times or whatever, the part of you that sometimes feel like a commitment is squelching you in some way? Can you… let yourself give voice to that side? See, might be hard to do it, might be especially hard to do in front of Arielle, but a lot of times when we don't give voice to that side. It's sneaks around behind the scenes and makes mischief. And I wonder if you could let yourself give a voice to, you know, I don't know if it says I don't want to be tied down yet or I don't know if it says, I'm scared of the commitment or I don't know what your words are but see if you can let yourself? 

00:20:20
DOMINIC I don't know. I think it's a huge combination of this side, umm… 

00:20:25
ARIELLE Just be honest. 

00:20:30
DOMINIC Yeah. I, I think it's a fear commitment. I think it's a fear of being tied down. I think it's a fear of ending up unhappy. I think it's a fear of, in other way, it could be any of these things, have been hinted at by Ari or anything. I just feel like there's so many like negative possibilities maybe, uh… 

00:20:50
ELLYN BADER Like imagining into the future? 

00:20:50
DOMINIC Yeah. 

00:20:50
PETER PEARSON Yeah, things that it will cost you what you would lose? 

00:20:55
DOMINIC Yeah. 

00:20:55
PETER PEARSON Like for example? 

00:21:00
DOMINIC Uh… I don't know. I saw. I saw my dad give up a huge piece of who he is. He ended up just living for her and just like tiptoeing around to make her happy. 

00:21:15
PETER PEARSON Wow! 

00:21:20
ELLYN BADER Your step mom? 

00:21:20
DOMINIC Yeah. He'd work all day, come home, do everything he could, uh… make her happy, I don't know. and it was just never enough. 

00:21:30
ELLYN BADER Or he gave up? You, your mom, he left a lot behind and then what he got with this shit, basically? 

00:21:40
ARIELLE The grass is always greener. 

00:21:40
ELLYN BADER What? 

00:21:40
ARIELLE The grass is always greener. 

00:21:45
ELLYN BADER Where'd you just go? 

00:21:50
[sil.] 

00:22:00
ELLYN BADER It's okay. Take your time. 

00:22:05
DOMINIC I hate talking about this shit. 

00:22:05
PETER PEARSON I heard it, man. Yeah. 

00:22:10
[sil.] 

00:22:15
ELLYN BADER Expect not talking about it has dominated a lot anyway? 

00:22:20
DOMINIC Makes me feel weak. 

00:22:25
ELLYN BADER Makes you feel weak? 

00:22:25
DOMINIC Yeah. 

00:22:30
ELLYN BADER To be… 

00:22:30
DOMINIC It's like everyone has their own issues, you know, it's just like I don't know why this shit just strikes accord with me. 

00:22:35
ELLYN BADER Well, what? He walked away from you. Do you really think, it's weak to care about that? To care about losing him? 

00:22:50
DOMINIC Yeah. Because, he wasn't there for a large part of me, becoming a man, so it's like why should I give a fuck now. 

00:23:00
ELLYN BADER But you know, why you give a fuck? 'Cause you wanna be, you wanna be a man. 

00:23:10
PETER PEARSON In a different way. 

00:23:10
ELLYN BADER You wanna be a real man. Not a weak man, you wanna be a real man. 

00:23:15
DOMINIC And I should need him too uh… grow into that. Should be able to find it on my own. 

00:23:25
ELLYN BADER You are growing into it. It's just. That you wanted him to be there. You wanted him to be able to leave you. You wanted him to be able to be that model. 

00:23:40
DOMINIC I cheated on her. I put her in this situation. Every reasons were here, it's 'cause of me. Put it all fucking come to that cause. Because, she just be able to shut the door on that and just not let it further affect me. I don't know now. Maybe I uh… I, and I just like that ready to impact someone else's, life. 

00:24:05
ARIELLE When we would talk about marriage, he would get angry. He would be like, "I know, we're gonna get married…" that we're… we're gonna", it would be like, we talk about buying house, we talk about kids. We talk about what we are gonna name our kids and it was beautiful and it was never anger or pressure or any of it, it was like, oh, we just love talking about our lives together, building our lives together, then we traveled, and we went Europe and we, see couples that'd be like in their 80s kissing, holding hands and we'd say it's gonna be us sitting that, you know, you're like, that was fine, but when it actually came down to it like the act of, we're actually gonna do this and we're gonna commit our life together, he would just get angry. 

00:24:50
PETER PEARSON Now, I got. I have to comments. I'm gonna make a speculation about you over here and speculation about this guy over there. The guy over there would be willing to talk about your future. The guy over there would get excited about it, and you would get excited talking to him about it. And you would start to feel oh, my god, I've… I've hit bull's eye, you know, I got the jackpot. He wants to, you both excited about it. Now, ironically this guy over here shows up, when he starts caring so much. This guy over here shows up because now, I'm screwed. From over here. Because, this guy over here thinks commitment means I got to give myself up, because I saw that played out. I saw get played out. Ironically, the closer he gets toward you the scarier it is for you over here. Would that be fair? 

00:25:55
DOMINIC Yeah. 

00:25:55
ARIELLE It's fine that you say that too, because, every time, he's cheated on me. It's when we're most intimate and happy. 

00:26:00
PETER PEARSON That's exactly! 

00:26:05
ELLYN BADER Right. Right. 

00:26:05
PETER PEARSON This guy, lets the walls down. He gets excited about connecting with you, he loves that connection with you and then here comes Mr. Hyde out of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, if you're familiar with that story. Here comes, scares the hell out of me. What hell I'm I getting into since something like that from over here would that be fair? What the hell am I getting into and then you start acting out. You start going instead of and this is great. This great, when I, when that earlier you said this is so hard to talk about and I think you're spot on. That guy gets excited about being with the Arielle. It's so hard for this guy to say, "guess what? If I sit over here in this chair, it scares the hell out of me, it scares the hell out of me." To have that connection with you, ironically it's because I care, that it scares me so much from over here would that be fair? 

00:27:10
DOMINIC Yeah. 

00:27:10
PETER PEARSON It scares the hell out of me. 

00:27:15
DOMINIC It's just so deep that, you know, she has enough time for this shit. 

00:27:20
ARIELLE Well, four years of my life… 

00:27:25
PETER PEARSON She maybe used to be in shit, you know… 

00:27:30
ARIELLE Like, what? It's just scares me because, I know that what's like he's monuments, like intimate those moments of my life that I'd save like being pregnant or having kids or getting married. Like, my mind is gonna go to we're most intimate now, so as he gonna go and be unfaithful. 

00:27:55
PETER PEARSON That's a legitimate concern. This guy over here gets really scared when he allows himself to feel that connection with you. 

00:28:05
ARIELLE Right. Yeah. 

00:28:05
PETER PEARSON Which is about your boundaries then, you know, instead of hoping, praying somehow, he will find a resolution between these alter egos, so that you can feel consistent and it's like, part of your task which is now at ease, you would just, where are you boundaries? 

00:28:20
ARIELLE It's up to him, now. I can't like, I can't, I can't became choose this person. Make him… I can't make him choose this side. 

00:28:30
PETER PEARSON That is correct. You can't make him choose from over here, to start off with certain supporting him. What would Dominic sitting over here a minute ago was accurately, said it's deep. 

00:28:45
ELLYN BADER It's deep and it's not deep. And I want to talk about the not deep side for a minute and then go back to the deep side. The not deep side is that many, many, many, many males who are your age or in their late 20s and early 30s have the conflict. The conflict that you have of wanting to commit and not wanting to commit, and having to sort that conflict out that's a normal conflict for men, umm… to have and when you talk about dragging Arielle through it. Yeah, part of what he's dragging you through is also having to face that issue of, am I going to learn not to give myself up to a man? Am I going to learn how to be a self, and how to be a person? And, how to have my own wishes, and thoughts, and desires and really keep that self-esteem in the phase of a relationship, and that's, that's normal growth. That's, that's what every young woman your age should be facing, is how am I going to be able to love somebody and still be a person at the same time? And so your stuff is bringing her into a conflict that's part of her own growth, whether she's with you or not with you. 

00:30:20
PETER PEARSON Pause. Do you believe what Ellen is saying? 

00:30:25
ARIELLE Yeah. 

00:30:25
PETER PEARSON Okay. Do you feel anything as you listen to what Ellen is saying? 

00:30:30
ARIELLE Yeah. I think it makes sense. I mean, I think logically I know that. 

00:30:35
PETER PEARSON And emotionally? 

00:30:40
ARIELLE Emotionally it's hard. You know, it's, literally logically, I know. I look in the mirror, and go, I'm, I'm great, but I can't hope that when we walk into a place and there's other beautiful girl that my… immediate like moment, you know, it is insecurity like I cannot… 

00:31:00
ELLYN BADER You think that his struggles are about you. 

00:31:05
ARIELLE I know they're not like, logically I know that, I know that (inaudible ), but I think that's (inaudible ) I state right, 'cause I know. But, he's a good person, I know that. 

00:31:20
PETER PEARSON He's a good person with a lot of fears for him over here. 

00:31:20
ARIELLE This person is person that I wanna spend my rest of life with, so logically I, I know all that, I just think that it's hard to think if you loved me so much, he is capable. 

00:31:40
ELLYN BADER It's hard to catch up emotionally late with what you know logically and to know that he's wrestling with his own conflicts that he would be having no matter who he was with. 

00:31:55
ARIELLE I know, I know that. I know it's not. 

00:31:55
ELLYN BADER But, you know, what in your head? 

00:31:55
ARIELLE I know. I had to just, don't wanna be enough, you know, like I wanna be enough for him to want, to like block that through this, but I can't. 

00:32:10
ELLYN BADER But, can I say I say it to you in different way? See, if he blocked it out, if he block this conflict out if in your fantasy and he loves you enough to do that, it would come back to bite you later. Because, nobody can block out this kind of a conflict, they might be able to block it out for a little while, but it's the resolution of it that makes a difference not to blocking it out. And it's so easy to be in your chair and feel like if only he loved me enough. 

00:32:45
ARIELLE Yeah. 

00:32:50
ELLYN BADER It's the little girl belief. 

00:32:50
ARIELLE You know, maybe, I'm in love with him that he's my person, but I'm just not that girlfriend if I don't know. 

00:32:55
ELLYN BADER It's the fairy tale fantasy that every girl grows up with. It's that belief that if we are enough, if we're pretty enough, or for smart enough, or for funny enough then that's going to be enough. That our partners aren't going to have their own conflicts. Do you know that every guy has conflicts? 

00:33:15
ARIELLE Hard for me, 'cause I see girlfriends of mine, you know, they been through guys half a long or you know, their engaged, their getting married or whatever and it's just sick, you know, that I can' t help with it. Be hurt by and him, because they've just, why don't I have that, you know, like why? 

00:33:40
ELLYN BADER No, you want it. You want it really badly. 

00:33:40
ARIELLE But, I want it with him. It's not like I want it. 

00:33:45
[sil.] 

00:33:50
ELLYN BADER You wanna be able to love him and have him love you and have it all go easy and smoothly. 

00:33:55
ARIELLE It's has not been easy or smooth. 

00:34:00
[sil.] 

00:34:05
ELLYN BADER Is there any part of you that knows that the more you can get to that strong sense of yourself, the better you're gonna be in the long run? 

00:34:15
ARIELLE I'll do that. We're gonna try, we're gonna let, I'm trying. 

00:34:20
ELLYN BADER It takes time. 

00:34:25
ARIELLE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:34:30
ELLYN BADER When I say people have conflicts, everybody has their own whatever they are and part of growing up, part of making a commitment, part of the establishing a relationship, if it's all about resolving those conflicts and pushing growth in each other and being willing to sign up for the, the journey. Umm… and when you are so, so hard on yourself, you're not accepting the part of yourself that's in a journey, that anybody who's alive and awake and willing to go on a journey is gonna be having and so. Yeah, there's a part of the deep stuff that you're working on that's important and then you don't want to drag her through. 

00:35:20
DOMINIC Yeah. 

00:35:25
ELLYN BADER But, there's also a part that in the journey and in the conflict that you have is dragging her to the kind of growth that's important for her to. 

00:35:35
[sil.] 

00:35:40
DOMINIC It's hard to buy into that concept. 

00:35:45
PETER PEARSON Well, think about it. Consider it. Well, see, here is a reality any time, we commit to something over here we have to say no to something over there so, that part of this guy over here is it's accurate. When we commit to X, we also have to say no to something else that's, you know, that goes with any commitment we make. 

00:36:05
DOMINIC Yeah. 

00:36:05
PETER PEARSON If you're going to be an N.B.A. basketball player, you make that commitment. You gotta say no to other things in your life to have that kind of dedication over here that's, that's just a reality. If you get this settled, do you think all the fights between you and Arielle will be over with after that? 

00:36:20
ELLYN BADER For the rest of your life? 

00:36:20
PETER PEARSON For the rest of your life? Do you think other shit will show up to you? 

00:36:25
DOMINIC Yeah. 

00:36:25
PETER PEARSON Good news, son. It'll happen. It's life. But then… 

00:36:30
DOMINIC Yeah. 

00:36:35
PETER PEARSON No, matter who you're with. 

00:36:40
ARIELLE I always ask him, I was saying like, you're like that, that looks appealing you that, that does like, you don't tell me, you, you, wouldn't ever think. 

00:36:50
PETER PEARSON You would rather know the truth. 

00:36:55
ARIELLE I would rather, I'm on that way. 

00:36:55
PETER PEARSON You can handle the truth when you get it. It's when things get underground and, you know, sneaky that's what drives you totally crazy. 

00:37:05
DOMINIC I know if she would rather just know, but there's just such a conflict. There's so much inner turmoil on my side that it's hard to even like, give her conclusion or I'll give her a definitive answer. 

00:37:25
ELLYN BADER You don't have a definite answer right now. 

00:37:25
PETER PEARSON It's impossible. 

00:37:30
ELLYN BADER Do you? 

00:37:35
ARIELLE I just don't. I mean, and that's okay. I just … I fell in this person for this a long time, you know, and I think that I know what I want and that's okay that he doesn't. But, I, I don't, I don't wanna be strung anymore. 

00:37:50
ELLYN BADER You what? 

00:37:50
ARIELLE I don't wanna be strung along anymore. I don't wanna be, yeah, I've been very committed to this man for a long time and, umm… it hopes that, that conflict would resolve. Uh… It hasn't obviously and that's okay, but… 

00:38:15
DOMINIC That's what I'm saying she doesn't have time for this, you know. 

00:38:15
PETER PEARSON Doesn't have what? 

00:38:20
DOMINIC She doesn't have time like, I mean, you're, you know, what you want, you know are pretty sure of what's going on and where you come from and what you need and what you want and I… now, where the fuck I come from? 

00:38:40
ARIELLE I'm also very sure that I felt like, a lot of why I'm here it's 'cause I wanted you to know like I wasn't gonna leave him, you know, I don't like what I did, like she'd hit fan and things got rough and things got hard and those people would have walk away. I didn't leave. And I wanted some part of me wanted to like who fucked him because, I did know what he's been through. And I thought that would make him respect me more, I don't think it has. 

00:39:20
ELLYN BADER Can I ask you something now, has this last time brought all of this more to the surface than it's ever been? 

00:39:25
ARIELLE I don't know, I don't know, the answer to that question I mean, what the time it happened, two years ago. I mean, I thought that we would be, we went to therapy. We, a lot of conversations about it and, you know, I thought that we, I thought that we'd, he'd changed. There's a lot of like, he represses a lot, the things like his feelings or his like immediate reaction and how he really feels 'cause, he doesn't want to hurt me or he doesn't upset me. Very obvious to me so, I ask those questions and he's doesn't ever felt comfortable being honest about them with me, and I just stand at the point right, it's like, you know, like I said I, I've showed him, I've, it didn't leave, you know, and I don't want, I don't want this want, I didn't want this, but I've don't. I don't know how much longer I can pull myself into this. 

00:40:35
PETER PEARSON It's a legitimate question, you know, that you're asking of yourself. It's totally legitimate. 

00:40:40
[sil.] 

00:40:45
ELLYN BADER How quickly would you each like to see a decision being made? 

00:40:50
[sil.] 

00:40:55
DOMINIC I'm so up side down right now. I don't even. 

00:40:55
ARIELLE He goes from here to here. Here to here, and here to here. 

00:41:00
DOMINIC It is like wake up and just look for reason to be happy for that day, I don't know. 

00:41:05
ARIELLE Some days he doesn't want to be with me at all. Says, we're both miserable, both unhappy. Let's not be together. 

00:41:15
PETER PEARSON And then other days this guy shows up. Over there? 

00:41:15
ARIELLE Right. 

00:41:15
PETER PEARSON And he shows up and you start to hope or think possibilities? 

00:41:20
ARIELLE Very well, I just can't like, like I can't take it anymore. Like, my… my boundaries these are that like, I physically, emotionally, cannot take any more. Like you don't want me, you don't want this, you can't commit to me, then let me go. 

00:41:45
PETER PEARSON And then this guy shows up? 

00:41:50
ARIELLE I can't take anymore. 

00:41:55
PETER PEARSON Uh-huh… And I think both of these sides are beginning to realize that you cannot and will not take anymore. I guess maybe there's a difference between I won't take anymore and I can't take anymore. Do you think there's a difference? 

00:42:10
ARIELLE I feel like if I say I won't. I might regret it. 

00:42:15
PETER PEARSON Okay. 

00:42:15
ARIELLE I'd say yeah, couple of months down the line I'd might think myself like, God if I just try a little harder or for a little longer, figured it out, and we could've been, what we wanted and I just, you know… 

00:42:40
ELLYN BADER So then you don't. I mean, then you stay right where you are. 

00:42:45
[sil.] 

00:42:50
ARIELLE Yeah, I mean, I'm in love with him, you know, it's never wavered. Until that, you know, so. 

00:43:00
ELLYN BADER Let's switch back seats. 

00:43:05
PETER PEARSON Is there anything from over here from the guy that who would like to make a commitment? So anything that this alter ego would say to this guy over here, who's afraid of it. Is there anything that you would say to him from the chair that you're in? 

00:43:20
DOMINIC Leave me the fuck all, I don't know. Oh, god damn schizophrenia, I'm fucking lunatic. Umm… like I know, it's healthy and I know it's good for more, I know, it's… what the possibilities are. I'd just… I don't know he just shows up. Like, you said. 

00:43:50
ELLYN BADER But, there, there is a voice over there that says leave me alone. Yeah, and I know what's healthy and good. 

00:43:55
PETER PEARSON This guy's had years of conditioning over here. Years of self protective walls built up, years of independence, years of fear of losing too much with a commitment. So, he's just. He rattles the cage a lot. 

00:44:20
DOMINIC Yeah. Damn man! 

00:44:25
[sil.] 

00:44:30
Ellyn & Pete check-in with each other before wrapping up the session. Arielle and Dominic remained in the room for this discussion. 

00:44:30
ELLYN BADER I feel the urgency for some decisions to get made that they're each expressing in different ways. Umm… I also wonder what it would be like to take the pressure off of that decision for some defined period of time because the conflict is so much on the surface now in terms of the part of him that wants to be a different kind of a man than his father. And the kind that's entrapped by all that, that he saw and that is scared of what commitment will make him end up, living like his dad? 

00:45:10
[sil.] 

00:45:15
ELLYN BADER And it seems like that's so much on the surface now that if he were to stick with that and really wrestle with through, getting through it, they would both be able to make a better decision. 

00:45:30
[sil.] 

00:45:35
PETER PEARSON Your question earlier when you asked, how soon would you like to make a decision, I mean, the easy answer is right away so I can stop the pain. 

00:45:40
ELLYN BADER Yeah, exactly. 

00:45:40
PETER PEARSON So, I want to make it as soon as possible just to stop the pain, but you're not gonna make an intelligent decision. Uh… at this point there are too many conflicts and uh… I'm thinking about the part of Dominic that saw the price that his dad paid for being committed and how that commitment ended, you know, to a lot of depression and finally to end the pain, he walks in front of a train. As a way of escaping that pain and not finding a way through it differently a hard process of being able to make the emotional risk of saying this is what's going on within me, this is what I'm struggling with. And to have somebody married to somebody who can say tell me more about your desire? And how you're compromised yourself and how you're slowly sucking the oxygen out of your system and now you wanna die, tell me about that? Those are conversations that not too many couples can have. The couples that can have those kinds of conversations are rare and they often find something extremely valuable going through that. Uh… it's kind of like diamonds. Basically, the only difference between diamonds and pencil lead is heat, pressure and time. because they're both made out of carbon. Now I think the world is good for having pencils, I like pencils and I think the world is also good for having diamonds, but we get, we, we as humans get to choose. If you want to create a diamond kind of relationship it would take heat, pressure and time. Uh… we don't get there just because we wanted it. The challenge is without knowing what the outcome is going to be, if we know the outcome of it's gonna turn out all right then, we, we'll sign up for the challenges, but when we don't know that's what makes it so darn hard and I think that's what we're faced with, but so I like the idea of can you take the pressure off of having to make a decision. Although in the back of your mind it's like yeah, as ain't gonna be forever, I'm not going to stay like this forever. So is the balance between trying to take pressure off and creating a larger space. 

00:48:10
ELLYN BADER Well, creating space to work on the… that cracks up where they're really stuck right now, each of them as individuals, but it's played out. But, I was thinking is that I have enormous respect for both of you. There are very few people as young as you were that are willing to face this kind of stuff, you know, I've been working with couples now for 30 years. There's not much I haven't seen and I've seen those people who are really willing to dig into the hard stuff and grow from it and those who run away from it. Every couple has something that's tough at the core. Everyone that I've ever seen has something tough at the core. I would love to see, you find a way if it works for you to take the pressure off the decision a little longer, but also know that you're going to work really hard over the next couple of months to find the answer that's the right answer that you both know it's the right answer, one way or the other, but not to make it quick to avoid the pain that you're in right this minute. And I don't know how that sounds, if that sounds worse or better? 

00:49:30
DOMINIC It makes sense to me, I just I know what you're looking for, you know… 

00:49:40
ARIELLE It doesn't help you when your say things like we're both miserable and unhappy. 

00:49:45
DOMINIC She's like sometimes… 

00:49:50
ELLYN BADER Somebody changed that. Can I make suggestion at least for the next little while, that instead of saying we're both miserable and unhappy, to say we're both going through some mighty fucking growing pain, it's right now. 

00:50:00
DOMINIC Yeah. 

00:50:00
ELLYN BADER This is I mean, this is like growth and development is and it stinks sometimes. 

00:50:10
DOMINIC It's difficult 'cause we live together too, so it's like we've lived in it everyday. And, and will have like glimmers of like being carefree and, you know, being really like nice to each other things like and that like flip of the switch like all that can like comforting and then we just be like cruel to each other, rude. 

00:50:35
ELLYN BADER Yeah, 'cause, you're scared of what's coming. Arielle is clear. She loves you, she would like to be with you. And you're scared to open up again that makes sense, but I do think it would be really helpful to take the pressure off her a little while and just say we're not taking the pressure off of dealing with the conflicts, and the conflict for you is how am I myself? How my back to my self-confidence? How my back to my self-esteem, in the face of going through all of this? How do I touch back to the real me? And yours that really is much more of how do I deal with the kind of man I wanna be? How do I really resolve that internal conflict around what type of man do I want to be? And that you're doing that side by side right now, together. And it's not right now the decision of whether you wanna be together and not be together, it's how do we resolve these two issues and then make a better decision. 

00:51:35
PETER PEARSON So we had potentially for you guys come back again, you guys wanna come back again? And the reason you would say, yes, it's what, so you get another helping a reality here that doesn't sound very good. 

00:51:50
ARIELLE No. It's pretty. And this is the most, uh… the influential therapy session that we've ever had together, I would say. The most… real. 

00:52:05
PETER PEARSON Real, real in the sense of what, Arielle? 

00:52:10
ARIELLE Umm… Being like in touch of what's going on inside I think, in like feeling, uh… for him and I know, but just understanding I guess. 

00:52:25
PETER PEARSON So Dominic you're willing to come back because… 

00:52:30
DOMINIC I like to caught on camera. 

00:52:30
PETER PEARSON Just watch she thinks, I'm ready to toss him out of the window. This is what he comes back with! Jeez! This thing, you wanna smack him with something? 

00:52:40
ARIELLE He's funny. 

00:52:40
PETER PEARSON God damn! Uh… sure. Make all this harder for it. Sure come here becoming Dearing and charming. Is that right? Jesus Christ! Umm… Uh… let's not have more compassion for you, Arielle. 

00:53:00
ARIELLE Thank you. That's it. I said, will do. 

00:53:00
PETER PEARSON Thank you. We'll see you in couple of weeks 

00:53:05
Arielle & Dominic 

00:53:05
Session + Commentary 

00:53:10
ELLYN BADER Hello. And thank you for joining us. I'm Ellen Bader and this is my husband Dr. Peter Pearson. Today, you're going to see us comment on the first session of a couple who came in, in the aftermath of infidelity. If you haven't already watched the session all the way through, we recommend that first in order to get the emotional impact you actually watch the entire session and then come back and join us here while we teach and do commentary as we stop the session and talk about why we intervened at particular places. The couple was referred to us by one of our associates at the Couple's Institute. All we knew when we sat down with them was that they had lived together, and worked together, and been a committed couple for four years. As therapist, when you work with complex relationship problems what you first see is not what you get, as you come to know the couple and explore the issues. Now, you know what we knew so let's get started with this second opportunity to watch the session of Arielle and Dominic. 

00:54:20
PETER PEARSON What would make our meeting today worthwhile? What would make each of you say, whoa, I am glad, we've been here today? 

00:54:30
DOMINIC I don't know obviously we're here for a reason. We definitely going through a rough patch, uh… there's definitely a lot of underlying issues, I guess would be appropriate to just jump right into it, but you know, I've had a few indiscretions or infidelities and cheated on her a few times. 

00:54:50
PETER PEARSON It's really interesting how people will describe and define the problem when they first come in. As Dominic did, he said… 

00:55:00
DOMINIC Definitely going through a rough patch. 

00:55:00
PETER PEARSON So there is a part of him that isn't minimizing the problem it's just a rough patch. And for the part of the brain that defines the problem in such a minimizing way, it has the implication that maybe we can just skip through this whole process of therapy and get to a resolution and move on, so we find it very interesting how people actually define the problem when they begin. 

00:55:25
ELLYN BADER And in fact, he just said just a few infidelities. 

00:55:30
PETER PEARSON And indiscretions. 

00:55:35
DOMINIC Going to therapy, you hear the other person's feelings, you hear what they're saying, but it's completely different to remind yourself of those every day. 

00:55:45
ELLYN BADER Would you like to be when able to? 

00:55:45
DOMINIC Yeah, but it's just always so difficult to uh… to sort of apply that. 

00:55:50
ELLYN BADER What he's talking about here is how what a hard time he has remembering the fact that his infidelities actually have an impact on her. And this is a good example of a partner with a low level of other differentiation. It's hard to remember that it bothers this woman, who is his fiancé. Umm… And this problem like Pete was talking about where they might have wanted to kind of skim over it, but it's a problem that can't be fixed quickly or fixed with communication skills. It's clearly showing up now that there is a developmental issue that we will be needing to address. 

00:56:30
DOMINIC Yeah, but it's just always so difficult to uh… to sort of apply that. 

00:56:35
PETER PEARSON Today, we will find a way to help you address that, challenge that prices you're talking about I think we can address that with more clarity. And help you get more in alignment with how you aspire to be if you come from higher yourself? I think we can do that today. Will it be useful for you, Arielle? 

00:56:55
ARIELLE I think that I would like to walk away with maybe an understanding of why he cheats? Is it because umm… he's not in love with me? It is because, yup, or doesn't, not supposed to be together or I mean, I'm just kind of like and un, unsure umm… of the why? And I know don't really think it will stop until, I knew that, like I don't think like he can't say to me, I'll never cheat on you again, I'll never been faithful to you again, 'cause he doesn't even know why he does it, right? Or understand it I guess. The previous two times I was very willing to umm… kind of let my guard down again. Umm… and like more open and I think, my first reaction is anger, it's always been like if I'm really, really hurt. I just get angry 'cause it's kind of like I'm not gonna allow to hurt like this, I'm not gonna show you that I'm hurt, I'm not gonna show you that vulnerable and that I'm sad. So I'm just gonna be really angry. And umm… I think that this time I've like kind of, umm… just like my walls are so up that I just don't even like I don't even understand 'cause I don't understand the why, so I don't under… like how could I, how could I move path, doesn't try to move forward if I don't even know that why, why you did what you did, and I'm just going to like allow you to hurt me again in that way, like I just I'm so barred right now. 

00:58:40
ELLYN BADER So you know you're really protecting yourself? 

00:58:40
ARIELLE Yeah, I mean, yeah. 

00:58:45
PETER PEARSON So you have a real incurred struggle within yourself? 

00:58:50
ARIELLE Yeah, I'm part of me like umm… like loves him and wanna marry him and have kids with him and so I'm away from them, so. Yeah, part of me it's like I'm to surface, why abuse myself, I don't make fool out myself. 

00:59:10
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah. You're… 

00:59:10
ARIELLE Continually, Continuously. 

00:59:10
PETER PEARSON Yeah, yeah, it being torn between those two opposing energies and emotions. I want and I'm afraid of. 

00:59:20
ELLYN BADER Yeah. There has been evil. 

00:59:25
PETER PEARSON Please don't cry. What are the emotions as you talk this? 

00:59:30
ARIELLE I mean, I'm sad obviously like I've just felt like is it ending. I don't know what to do, like I don't want this. I feel like kind of numb, but kind of like I don't know. I didn't see this happening, I felt like in a minute, like just everything switched. 

00:59:45
ELLYN BADER So you were kind of, you were moving forward making plans to get married, hoping to be married? 

00:59:50
ARIELLE Yeah. And we, we uh… we said we'd be engaged before our anniversary. Uh… If not and we said we'd be engaged by then so. It's little painful. I don't want him to live with like what are you doing? Who are you with? You know, I want to be a warden, I don't wanna live like that. Umm… and I can't understand why or why he does what he does that he doesn't know what he does, so I don't know how like to past it and I think that he won't continue it. I don't I wanna be an open relationship so, I mean. 

01:00:30
Arielle's Problem 

01:00:35
ARIELLE I have been very committed my whole life it's been almost too much subject around our relationship. Is every decision I made, everything I did was for us and for our future, for our relationship. Our friends are so unmatched. Our families are so unmatched, we now business together. We, umm… we live together, you know, like homed together, like we… 

01:00:55
ELLYN BADER So everything was joint. Everything was so… 

01:00:55
ARIELLE Pretty into, yeah, it's very, very joyous, but you know, that's almost like I mean, they're four plus years, I mean, feels like and it was unmatched, but feels very sad. 

01:01:10
PETER PEARSON The downside of too much togetherness is what? We're too much in joint, what's the downside of organizing too much of your life around the couple, etcetera, etcetera, what's the downside of that? 

01:01:20
ARIELLE I was placing my self-worth on what he taught me. It's not feeling sexy, it's not feeling, I just wonder if I wasn't enough like, you know, which is all the time. So, I think that's on me right, I think? 

01:01:40
ELLYN BADER Kind of like you've let yourself be robbed? 

01:01:45
PETER PEARSON Actually Ellyn is doing a really nice job right there, confirming and reaffirming what Arielle just described which is I lost myself in this relationship. And it's a problem of low self differentiation, the price that Arielle paid for being so enmeshed, so dependent and giving herself up in this relationship and when Ellen underlines that, it sets the stage for our Arielle's work, down the road. 

01:02:10
ELLYN BADER My intervention was a very low level confrontation of her process, but what was great with how Pete set it up with his question to her earlier which was… 

01:02:25
PETER PEARSON The downside of too much togetherness is what? 

01:02:30
ELLYN BADER And it was actually that question that helped to surface her developmental issue. 

01:02:35
ELLYN BADER You let yourself be robbed? 

01:02:40
ARIELLE I mean, I was a very confident person. Like, I was, today I feel umm… I don't know just was confident. When, some, when you're so enough for someone I need are unfaithful to you, it's like rock side confidence. 

01:02:55
ELLYN BADER How did you find out about me infidelity? 

01:02:55
ARIELLE I can always tell like he'll cheat on me and then he'll get very, very angry. The next day is, he's trying to let, create something that doesn't exist and I'm like whoa! 

01:03:05
DOMINIC No. I don't think I'm trying to create something that doesn't exist. I think I realize, you know, and what've done, you know, reflective anger, I think. Umm… Is weird as this sounds I think it's difficult to the cheater. Uh… you know, you wear it, you have to look in the mirror and you have to just… 

01:03:30
ELLYN BADER So is it fair to say, you're mad at yourself? And you've feeling a lot of shame too? 

01:03:40
ARIELLE He felt so much shame and so much guilt that it over shadows in my opinion. 

01:03:45
PETER PEARSON There's a lot going on here, in just that very simple series of transactions. Dominic is beginning to talk about his guilt and his shame. And Arielle jumps in basically to relieve Dominic of the stress of talking about his guilt and shame. 

01:04:05
ARIELLE He feels so much shame and so much guilt that it over shadows in my opinion. 

01:04:10
PETER PEARSON So two things. You get really uh… low level introduction to how Arielle protects Dominic from facing from what he's really talking about. The other thing is, when Dominic talks about his guilt and shame, there is a temptation I think for a lot of therapist to try to do something to help Dominic relieved… be relieved of the guilt and shame that he feels. However, his guilt and shame is really a good sign, it's a sign of other differentiation. So that when he really begins to recognize and accept that Arielle is a separate person, who is dealing with the repercussions of what he has done, that kind of guilt and shame actually is a catalyst for a on, for a continued differentiation on Dominic's part to be aware of the impact of what he's doing and having on Arielle. 

01:05:10
ELLYN BADER To underline something Pete said, you definitely at this point don't wanna take away his donning awareness and his feelings of guilt and shame, as he recognizes that he is indeed having an impact on her. 

01:05:25
ARIELLE And I just feel bad for him. I'm feeling bad for you, can you just like for once just like… 

01:05:35
ELLYN BADER Create some space to feel that… 

01:05:35
ARIELLE Feel for me, yeah. Like. 

01:05:40
DOMINIC Yeah. It's tough. 

01:05:45
ELLYN BADER So you're both been in a lot of pain in different way, each of you. It's hard to make space when create space. To figure out how to deal with it each of your pain separately? 

01:05:55
ARIELLE Without moving on, yeah. 

01:06:00
DOMINIC Obviously, I've had a lot of time to think about this, but it's just like the shockwaves, just keep coming. Everyday I kind of realize something new that I've done too negatively impact her. So it's just, uh… hard to deal with. 

01:06:20
Dominic's History 

01:06:25
DOMINIC Obviously, a lot of my, umm… indiscretions and, you know, selfishness and things of that nature. Stem from my by background a little bit umm… 

01:06:40
[sil.] 

01:06:45
ARIELLE His dad committed suicide… uh… in front of a train. And I think like, I can't imagine what's that like uh… and I think a lot of like me forgiving him, because I feel bad for him, you know, like. 

01:07:15
ELLYN BADER You care, you care a lot… you really care. 

01:07:20
ARIELLE I feel perfect for him, you know, I just… I wish he didn't do that to him. 

01:07:30
PETER PEARSON He can just walk in front of a train? 

01:07:30
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:07:30
PETER PEARSON How old are you when that happened? 

01:07:35
DOMINIC Uh… 20. Almost. 

01:07:35
ELLYN BADER And how old are you now? 

01:07:40
DOMINIC 29. 

01:07:40
ELLYN BADER Whoa! It's not that long ago. 

01:07:45
DOMINIC Yeah. I hadn't talk to him for like three years before he did that. 

01:07:50
ELLYN BADER Had you cut him off?. 

01:07:50
DOMINIC Yeah, I think my last words were eat shit or fuck you or something that. 

01:08:00
PETER PEARSON What a pain behind that expression now? 

01:08:00
ELLYN BADER You were mad at him. You know, what? 

01:08:00
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:08:05
PETER PEARSON Yeah. A lot of pain behind that one. 

01:08:10
DOMINIC Yeah. My dad had an affair on my mom, uh… and uh… married the woman and, he had an affair with. And my whole life grown up, she hated me. Uh… she uh… 

01:08:25
ELLYN BADER She's your step mother, step mom? 

01:08:30
DOMINIC Yeah. So finally when I got old enough, I kind of understood what was going, when I was 15 or 16. Uh… like I had uh… you know, I could see what was going on uh… so I told to him kind of fuck you for pretty much, when this happened. And then uh… 

01:08:55
ELLYN BADER Was the fuck you, fuck you for? 

01:09:00
DOMINIC Kind of taking her side uh… and then I got into a lot of trouble in High School and went to jail for a year and uh… he, I didn't to talk him for a year and then he just showed up at my sentencing and umm… and then when they gave me of uh… you know, then half or many months or whatever the year, they were just like bail have take his about and then he just side walked then on. And then I got out of jail and went to college completely fucked my life around. Uh… was doing really good in school and then uh… my mom just called me, on like on Friday. She was like hey! Uh… I'm here, where are you? And I was like why the fuck did you drive over, over here? Uh… then umm… yeah, she just came and told me what happened. But, it's like I didn't, it's just doesn't seem fair to her, all right for, you know, this kind of shit too. I mean, it's no excuse for taking her feeling and the emotions, trampling them. 

01:10:35
ELLYN BADER Think, I'm getting what you said, beginning there's a part of you that wants to understand yourself better. Doesn't like being in the kind of pain you're in, kind of forcing kind of pain that she's in? 

01:10:45
DOMINIC Specially, if like all this shit with my dad and, you know, all that stuff it's like. It's hard enough for me and then just the fact that like I let it spill over into her life kind of. 

01:11:00
ELLYN BADER You know, you said a few minutes ago like you're afraid of commitment and I wonder if it's a few things, I mean, I wonder if it's is, is a that there's a problem that wants to commit and another part it's absolutely terrified of the repercussions if you do? 

01:11:20
DOMINIC Yeah. Yeah. 

01:11:20
ELLYN BADER And you're aware of those two part. And aware of them pushing and pulling on you? 

01:11:25
DOMINIC Really. 

01:11:25
ELLYN BADER Are you okay for couple of minutes to do a bit of dialogue between those two part of yourself? 

01:11:30
DOMINIC Hope so. Like stepping outside of myself. 

01:11:35
PETER PEARSON We all have competing alter egos. There's one part of me that wants to get into good shape, you know, for a lot of good reasons that is another part of me that wants to indulge. Yeah, I know that I'll figure Ben and Jerry's. There is one part of me that wants to savor for the future and another part of me that wants to spend right now, so we all have these different alter egos that compete different a set of interests uh… etcetera. So having a dialogue sometimes can make this clear. So the alter ego that says I'm interested in making a greater commitment. Why would that part of you be interested in making a greater commitment? 

01:12:15
DOMINIC To you know, uh… fully indulge in all the, uh… positive aspects of life like, you know, having this all marriage, having, having kids, having, you know, all those good things. 

01:12:30
ELLYN BADER So you have an image of good things, run aside of you that wants to commit? 

01:12:30
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:12:35
PETER PEARSON And creating things that you missed out on growing up. It would be nice to pass that on? Okay. And the other reason for making a commitment? 

01:12:45
DOMINIC Being in love. 

01:12:50
PETER PEARSON Uh… I didn't prompt that okay? Just F.Y.I, Arielle . that was just spontaneous uh… expression. Why else, Dominic, Why else would the commitment be good? 

01:13:05
DOMINIC For the sake of committing of something.. 

01:13:10
PETER PEARSON For the sake committing to something? That means this part longs to feel this kind of commitment to really throw yourself into something? And the advantage of that would be what? 

01:13:25
DOMINIC I think it builds character. 

01:13:25
PETER PEARSON It does enhance one of the character for that part of yourself. 

01:13:30
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:13:35
ELLYN BADER As Pete and I are preceding here, we're doing our best to see if Dominic can really describe the things that are true for him on the side of him that wants to commit. And, it's interesting that he's talking about his view of commitment is that it would build internal character or it would build a sense of strength in him and that's another way of talking about actually of self differentiation that he is able to accomplish the things in his life that he desires, that he wants, that he wishes for and that he seeks. And he can imagine that actually giving him a stronger sense of self. 

01:14:10
PETER PEARSON It's kind of interesting, any time you work with a couple, you, there's generally a split. This is what I want to do or how I aspire to be to create a better relationship, and a more connected relationship and almost always then there will be a resistance from another part of that person, so the easiest way that we have found or the simplest way often, is to have a person describe the advantages of making that commitment, of making that effort to create a better relationship and then to be able to hear what does the alter ego say that is in, in essentially an opposition to creating a better relationship and we have found that having them literally move from the aspirational chair to the chair over here and talk about the opposition to the evolution, it's the simplest way to clarify those two places it's much easier to do it in two different chairs than, it is to just have one person sitting there and try to explore both sides. So we're getting ready to set up to have Dominic come over and sit in the other chair and say, let's hear from the loyal opposition. The way that I often set it up is I will tell the couple or the individual that it's, you're not schizophrenic by having two competing voices uh… which is why I say there's a part of me that wants to exercise and there's a part of me that wants to indulge, it normalizes what they will experience when they go from one chair to the other. 

01:15:50
ELLYN BADER In this case, it's committing to a person. It's committing to a future. It's… 

01:16:00
DOMINIC Showing like they hate that showing uh… shows a lot, you know, all those things your parents tell you about. 

01:16:10
ELLYN BADER And when you think about a lot of those things they, you just said like, being able to have that kind of commitment. What do you imagine feeling about yourself? 

01:16:20
DOMINIC I don't feel accomplished. 

01:16:25
ELLYN BADER You don't feel accomplished? 

01:16:25
DOMINIC Yeah. I feel like I would set up my lineage, you know, my kids, set them on the right track. 

01:16:35
ELLYN BADER So it's a solid, good. 

01:16:35
DOMINIC Something… 

01:16:35
ELLYN BADER Centered kind of feeling. 

01:16:35
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:16:40
DOMINIC I used to see my friends, family and some stuff like that. When I was a little kid. It is much different. 

01:16:50
ELLYN BADER And did you kind of envy that one? 

01:16:50
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:16:55
ELLYN BADER Yeah. So when you were little like that, was their part of you that even wished that someday you could grow up and create that? 

01:17:00
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:17:00
ELLYN BADER So you watched and you looked and you notice too? 

01:17:05
DOMINIC But, then like growing up and doing it, it's a different story. 

01:17:10
ELLYN BADER Oh, it's a lot harder. 

01:17:10
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:17:15
PETER PEARSON Now, here's what's interesting in setting up the dialogue between the two alter egos. I think, and we both think that how important it is for the therapist to help amplify the benefits of making the change that they would aspire to make. So, we will add things, will amplify things, we will plant some seeds about what are the benefits for making this change. So that that part of Dominic, can begin to see, feel, and experience with those benefits of change will make for his arduous journey about grow… basically growing up to become a better partner, so amplifying the benefits of the change are really crucial. 

01:17:55
[sil.] 

01:18:00
ELLYN BADER When you sit there, and you remember what you wanted as a child and you think about that feeling, of feeling accomplished in that sense of, yeah, I'm setting up my lineage. What do you feel when you think about all the things are on that side? 

01:18:20
DOMINIC Proud of just the idea. I mean, I don't take, it's like puffing out your chest. 

01:18:25
PETER PEARSON Now. Come over here. Sit in this chair. Unlike after your, of you're there alter ego. Come over here and sit in this chair. As a therapist, when you feel like you have pretty much completed the first pass and all the benefits for change at that point having come over and sit in the other chair and then let the alter ego of Dominic challenge himself, so that, you the therapist, don't have to challenge him or try to get the yes, but, reasons why it's hard for him to change. If he can identify those things himself then you, the therapist, can even amplify support and be on the side of him that is opposed to change. So that both sides of the client can feel like they are being understood and or accepted and or supported by you, the therapist. 

01:19:20
ELLYN BADER Another good thing about this particular reason for changing at this moment was, when he said I would feel proud sitting in the room, it was very palpable. What do you feel when you think about all the things are on that side? 

01:19:35
DOMINIC Proud of just the idea. 

01:19:40
ELLYN BADER You could really feel his sense of pride. And that he was getting that momentary experience of it. So that was a good time to make the shift, now in a couple minutes, you're gonna see something we did that's a mistake, and we did it because of, really because of the filming, but I actually went over and sat in the other chair, and when you're doing this in your own office, you don't want to be sitting in the chair that the person is speaking to, ‘cause you want that blank space where they can see the other part of them that was previously expressed sitting in that chair. 

01:20:15
[sil.] 

01:20:20
PETER PEARSON So… the alter ego over there was talking about here all the advantages of, of making a commitment being in a committed relationship and over there there's a sense of pride and integrity that alter ego Dominic says. Here are the advantages of commitment. Over here is this is why I shy away from commitment. What would this guy say over here? Commitment sounds good, but… 

01:20:45
DOMINIC This is fucked up. Umm… I don't know what it would say, but it just reverts back to selfishness, I think. 

01:20:50
ELLYN BADER Did you watch your father being selfish and doing what he wanted? 

01:20:55
DOMINIC No. I don't. He had a lot of that, but when I was old enough my mom let me know that, you know, this is probably the right time to tell you, but uh… I kinda ask though, I kinda asked about my step-mom and she was like yeah, yeah, be fair with her. And then I thought whoa! Was he unhappy with my mom and then uh… saw him really unhappy in his current relationship and I don't know I think that all just kinda fucked my… 

01:21:25
ELLYN BADER The part of you that makes it okay to be with another girl or woman at, at some times, the three times or whatever. The part of you that sometimes feel like a commitment is squelching you in some way. Can you let yourself give voice to that side? See might be hard to do it, might be especially hard to do in front of Arielle, but a lot of times when we don't give voice to that side. It's sneaks around behind the scenes and makes mischief. 

01:21:55
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:22:00
ELLYN BADER And I wonder if you could let yourself give a voice to, you know, I don't know if it says I don't want to be tied down yet or I don't know if it says, I'm scared of the commitment, or I don't know what your words are… Through this section of the session, I'm trying here to make it really possible for him to express the side of him that wants to cheat, that wants to be unfaithful, that wants to have other sexual partners. And that's a very hard thing for him to do in front of Arielle. And so, I'm trying to normalize it, I'm trying to say that yeah, in fact, it is okay to express some of this in front of her. Umm… And just before this it was very poignant to hear him talking about his own father and the role model that his father provided, which was a model of self-sacrifice, it was a model of niggling under and it was not a role model that Dominic could aspire to himself. But, see if you can let yourself? 

01:23:10
DOMINIC I don't know. I think it's a huge combination of this side, umm… 

01:23:15
ARIELLE Just be honest. 

01:23:15
DOMINIC Yeah. I, I think it's a fear commitment. I think it's a fear of being tied down. I think it's a fear of ending up unhappy. I think it's a fear of, up though it can be any of these things have been hinted at by Arie or anything. I just feel like there's so many like negative possibilities maybe, uh… 

01:23:40
ELLYN BADER Like imagining into the future? 

01:23:40
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:23:40
PETER PEARSON Yeah, things that it will cost you what you would lose? 

01:23:45
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:23:45
PETER PEARSON Like for example…? 

01:23:50
DOMINIC Uh… I don't know. I saw. I saw my dad give up a huge piece of who he is. He ended up just living for her and just like tiptoeing around and make her happy. 

01:24:05
PETER PEARSON Wow! 

01:24:05
ELLYN BADER Your step-mom? 

01:24:10
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:24:10
ELLYN BADER So here again, Dominic, confirms that his view of a committed relationship is that it is not possible to be fulfilled as an individual to have a high level of self differentiation and be in a committed partnership. 

01:24:30
DOMINIC You can work all day, come home, do everything you could, uh… make her happy, I don't know. It was just never enough. 

01:24:40
ELLYN BADER Or he gave up? You, your mom, he left a lot behind and then what he got was shit, basically? 

01:24:50
ARIELLE The grass is always greener. 

01:24:50
ELLYN BADER What? 

01:24:50
ARIELLE The grass is always greener. 

01:24:55
ELLYN BADER Mm-huh. Where'd you just go? 

01:25:00
[sil.] 

01:25:10
ELLYN BADER It's okay. Take your time. 

01:25:15
DOMINIC I hate talking about this shit. 

01:25:15
PETER PEARSON I heard it man. Yeah. 

01:25:20
ELLYN BADER Expect not talking about and has dominated a lot anyway? 

01:25:25
[sil.] 

01:25:30
DOMINIC Makes me feel weak. 

01:25:35
ELLYN BADER It makes you feel weak? 

01:25:35
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:25:35
ELLYN BADER To be… 

01:25:40
DOMINIC It's like everyone has their own issues, you know, it's just like I don't know why this shit just strikes a chord with me. 

01:25:45
ELLYN BADER Well, He walked away from you. Do you really think it's weak to care about that? To care about losing him? 

01:26:00
DOMINIC Yeah. Because… he wasn't there for a large part of me, becoming a man, so it's like why should I give a fuck now. 

01:26:10
ELLYN BADER But you know, why you give a fuck? 'Cause you wanna be, you wanna be a man. 

01:26:20
PETER PEARSON In a different way. 

01:26:20
ELLYN BADER You wanna be a, for real man. Not a weak man, you wanna be a real man. 

01:26:25
DOMINIC And I should need him too uh… grow into that. Should be able to find it up on my own. 

01:26:35
ELLYN BADER You are growing into it. It's just, that you wanted him to be there. You wanted him to be able to leave you. You wanted him to be able to be that model. 

01:26:50
DOMINIC I cheated on her. I put her in this situation. And the reasons were here, it's 'cause of me. Put it all fucking come to that could I say. Because, she just be able to shut the door and just not let it further affect me. I don't know now. Maybe I uh… I just like not ready to impact someone else's, life. 

01:27:15
ARIELLE When we talk about marriage, he would get angry. He would be like, "I know, we're gonna get married…" Like, "we're… we're gonna, it would be like, we talk about buying house, we talk about kids. We talk about what we are gonna name our kids and it was beautiful and it was never anger or pressure or any of it, it was like, oh, we just love talking about our lives together, building our lives together, then we traveled, and we went Europe and we, see couples that'd be like in their 80's kissing, holding hands and we'd say it's gonna be awesome and that, you know, you're like, that was fine, but when it actually came down to it like the act of, we're actually gonna do this and we're gonna commit our life together, he would just get angry. 

01:28:00
PETER PEARSON Now, I got, I have to comments. I'm gonna make a speculation about you over here and speculation about this guy over there. The guy over there would be willing to talk about your future. The guy over there would get excited about it, and you would get excited talking to him about it. And you would start to feel oh, my god, I've… I've hit bull's eye, you know, I got the jackpot. He wants to, you both excited about it. Now, ironically this guy over here shows up when he starts caring so much. This guy over here shows up because now, I'm screwed from over here. Because, this guy over here thinks commitment means, I've got to give myself up, because I saw that played out, I saw get played out. Ironically, the closer he gets toward you the scarier it is for you over here. Would that be fair? 

01:29:00
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:29:05
ARIELLE That's why that you say that to me because, every time, he's cheated on me. It's when we're most intimate and happy. 

01:29:10
ELLYN BADER This really, really begins to speak to the complexity of infidelity. I think Pete, is doing a lovely job in terms of being descriptive about the two parts of him. He's not judging him, and he's also indirectly helping Arielle as he says umm… of course, the guy who wants to be with you and who you have fun with and who you can plan a future with is the guy sitting in that chair, but the other guy shows up as she put it here umm… the closer they get and the more and the closer they get to that moment of committing then the other guy shows up who says, "Oh, my gosh, if I commit, then I'm not gonna be able to be a person." 

01:29:55
PETER PEARSON It's one of the advantages of having the person sit in two different chairs to describe what's going on without making a judgment about either side. So, it simplifies the job of the therapist to say, "Well, from over here your partner is doing X, from over here, your partner is doing Y. And having the visuals split for, for Arielle makes it simpler for her to begin to understand the conflicts that Dominic is experiencing. That's exactly! 

01:30:30
ELLYN BADER Right. Right. 

01:30:35
PETER PEARSON This guy, lets the walls down. He gets excited about connecting with you, he loves that connection with you and then here comes Mr. Hyde out of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, if you're familiar with that story. Here comes, scares the hell out of me. What hell I'm I getting into since something like that from over here would that be fair? 

01:30:55
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:31:00
PETER PEARSON What the hell am I getting into and then you start acting out. You start going instead of and this is great, this great, when I, when that earlier you said this is so hard to talk about and I think you're spot on. That guy gets excited about being with the Arielle. It's so hard for this guy to say, 'guess what? If I sit over here in this chair, its scars the hell out of me, it scares the hell out of me. To have that connection with you, ironically it's because I care, that it scares me so much from over here would that be fair? 

01:31:35
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:31:40
PETER PEARSON It scares the hell out of me. 

01:31:45
DOMINIC It's just. So deep that, you know, she has enough time for this shit. 

01:31:50
ARIELLE Well, four years of my life… 

01:31:55
PETER PEARSON She made use to be in shit, you know… 

01:32:00
ARIELLE Like, what? It's just scares me because, I know that what's like he's monument us like intimate those moments of my life that I saved like being pregnant or having kids or getting married. Like, my mind is gonna go to we're most intimate now, so as he gonna go and be unfaithful. 

01:32:20
PETER PEARSON That's a legitimate concern. This guy over here gets really scared when he allows himself to feel that connection with you. 

01:32:35
ARIELLE Right. Yeah. 

01:32:35
PETER PEARSON Which is about your boundaries then, you know, instead of hoping, praying somehow, he will find a resolution between these alter egos, so that you can feel consistent and it's like, part of your task which is now at ease, which is where your boundaries? 

01:32:50
ARIELLE It's up to him, now. I can't like, I can't, I can't became, choose this person. I can't make him choose this side. 

01:33:00
PETER PEARSON That is correct. You can't make him choose from over here to start on the sudden supporting him. Now what would Dominic sitting over here a minute ago was actually, he said it's deep. 

01:33:15
ELLYN BADER It's deep and it's not deep. And I want to talk about the not deep side for a minute and then go back to the deep side. The not deep side is that many, many, many, many males who are your age or in their late 20's and early 30's have the conflict. The conflict that you have of wanting to commit and not wanting to commit. And having to sort that conflict out that's a normal conflict for men, umm…to have and when you talk about dragging Arielle through it… Yeah, part of what he's dragging you through is also having to face that issue of, am I going to learn not to give myself up to a man? Am I going to learn how to be a self, and how to be a person? And, how to have my own wishes, and thoughts, and desires and really keep that self-esteem in the phase of a relationship? 

01:34:25
PETER PEARSON See, Ellyn is actually doing a really nice job. Giving an operational definition to the concept of differentiation and talking about what's required of Arielle, in the process of differentiation and what her developmental tasks are going to be? 

01:34:45
ELLYN BADER And that's, that's normal growth. That's, that's what every young woman your age should be facing, is how am I going to be able to love somebody and still be a person at the same time? And so your stuff is bringing her into a conflict that's part of her own growth, whether she's with you or not with you. 

01:35:10
PETER PEARSON Pause. Do you believe what Ellyn is saying? 

01:35:15
ARIELLE Yeah. 

01:35:15
PETER PEARSON Okay. Do you feel anything as you listen to what Ellen is saying? 

01:35:20
ARIELLE Yeah, I think it makes sense, I mean, I think logically I know that. 

01:35:25
PETER PEARSON And emotionally? 

01:35:25
ARIELLE Emotionally it's hard. You know, it's logically, I know. I look in the mirror, I know I'm great, but I can't help that. When we walk into a place and there's other beautiful girl that my immediate like moment, you know, it is insecurity like I can't… 

01:35:50
ELLYN BADER You think that his struggles are about you. 

01:35:55
ARIELLE I know they're not like, logically I know that, I know that, but I think that's probably where I've stayed right, 'cause I know. But, he's a good person, I know that. 

01:36:05
PETER PEARSON He's a good person with a lot of fears for him over here. 

01:36:10
ARIELLE This person is person that I wanna spend my rest of life with, so logically I, I know all of that, I just think that it's hard to think if you loved me so much, he is capable. 

01:36:25
ELLYN BADER It's hard to catch up emotionally with what you know logically. And to know that he's wrestling with his own conflicts that he would be having no matter who he was with. One important thing that's happening here is that, each of them have their own developmental issues, each of them have their own conflicts and so often when we start with a couple, those are very mushed together and part of the early work of therapy is separating out, separating out the conflicts that are his and what belongs to him to work on, and separating out what's hers. And she's sitting here beginning to recognize that what she knows logically in her head she's not yet internally strong enough to have the emotional fortitude to actually feel it and then be able to act on it with him. He's wrestling with his own conflicts. That he would be having no matter who he was with. 

01:37:30
ARIELLE I know, I know that. I know it's not. 

01:37:30
ELLYN BADER But, you know it in your head? 

01:37:35
ARIELLE I know. I had to just, don't wanna be enough, you know, like I wanna be enough for him to want, to like block that through this, but I can't. 

01:37:45
ELLYN BADER But, can I say I say it to you in different way? See, if he blocked it out, if he block this conflict out if in your fantasy and he loves you enough to do that, it would come back to by you later. Because, nobody can block out this kind of a conflict, they might be able to block it out for a little while, but it's the resolution of it that makes a difference not the blocking it out. 

01:38:10
ARIELLE Right 

01:38:15
ELLYN BADER And it's so easy to be in your chair and feel like if only he loved me enough. 

01:38:20
ARIELLE Yeah 

01:38:25
ELLYN BADER It's the little girl belief. 

01:38:25
ARIELLE You know, maybe, I'm in love with him that he's my person, but I'm just not that girlfriend to him, I don't know. 

01:38:30
ELLYN BADER It's the fairy tale fantasy that every girl grows up with. It's that belief that if we are enough, if we're pretty enough, if we're smart enough, if we're funny enough that then, that's going to be enough. That our partners aren't going to have their own conflicts. Do you know that every guy has conflicts? 

01:38:55
ARIELLE Hard for me, 'cause I see girlfriends of mine, you know, they been through guys have this long or you know, their engaged, their getting married or whatever and it's too slick, you know, that I can't help with it. Be hurt by and him, because they've just, why don't I have that, you know, like why? 

01:39:15
ELLYN BADER No, you want it. You want it really badly. 

01:39:15
ARIELLE But, I want it with him. It's not like I want it. 

01:39:20
[sil.] 

01:39:25
ELLYN BADER You wanna be able to love him and have him love you and have it all go easy and smoothly. 

01:39:30
[sil.] 

01:39:35
ARIELLE It has not been easy or smooth. 

01:39:40
ELLYN BADER Is there any part of you that knows that the more you can get to that strong sense of yourself, the better you're going to be in the long run? 

01:39:50
ARIELLE I'll do that. We're gonna try, we're gonna let, I'm trying. 

01:39:55
ELLYN BADER It takes time. 

01:40:00
ARIELLE Yeah, yeah. 

01:40:05
ELLYN BADER When I say people have conflicts, everybody has their own whatever they are and part of growing up, part of making a commitment, part of the establishing a relationship it's all about resolving those conflicts and pushing growth in each other and being willing to sign up for the, the journey. Umm… and when you are so, so hard on yourself, you're not accepting the part of yourself that's in a journey, that anybody who's alive and awake and willing to go on in journey is gonna be having and so. Yeah, there's a part of the deep stuff that you're working on that's important you don't want to drag her through. 

01:40:55
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:41:00
ELLYN BADER But, there's also a part that in the journey and in the conflict that you have is dragging her to the kind of growth that's important for her too. 

01:41:15
DOMINIC It's hard to buy into that concept. 

01:41:20
PETER PEARSON Well, think about it. Consider it. Let's see here is a reality any time we commit to something over here we have to say no to something over there so, that part of this guy over here is it's accurate. When we commit to X, we also have to say no to something else that's, you know, that goes with any commitment we make. 

01:41:40
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:41:40
PETER PEARSON If you're going to be an NBA basketball player, you make that commitment. You've got to say no to other things in your life to have that kind of dedication over here that's, that's just a reality. If you get this settled, do you think all the fights between you and Arielle will be over with after that. 

01:41:55
ELLYN BADER For the rest of your life? 

01:42:00
PETER PEARSON For the rest of your life. Do you think other shit will show up to you? 

01:42:00
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:42:00
PETER PEARSON Good news, uh… It'll happen. It's life. (inaudible ). 

01:42:09
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:42:10
PETER PEARSON No, matter who you with. 

01:42:15
ARIELLE I was asking, I was saying like, you like that, that looks building you that, that does like, you don't tell me, you, you, wouldn't ever think. 

01:42:25
PETER PEARSON You would rather know the truth. 

01:42:30
ARIELLE I'm rather, I'm on that way. 

01:42:30
PETER PEARSON You can handle the truth when you get it. It's when things get underground and, you know, sneaky that's what drives you totally crazy. 

01:42:40
DOMINIC I know she would rather just know, but there's just such a conflict. There's so much inner turmoil on my side that it's hard to even like, you've heard conclusion of her. Give her a definitive answer. 

01:43:00
ELLYN BADER You don't have a definite answer right now. 

01:43:05
PETER PEARSON It's impossible. 

01:43:05
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:43:05
ELLYN BADER Do you? 

01:43:10
ARIELLE I just don't. I mean, and that's okay. I just I've been known this person for this long time, you know, and I think that I know what I want and that's okay that he doesn't. But, I, I don't, it's strong and what. I don't wanna be strung anymore. I don't wanna be, you know, I've been very committed to this man for a long time and, umm… it hopes that, that conflict would resolve. Uh… it hasn't obviously and that's okay, but… 

01:43:50
DOMINIC That's what I'm saying she doesn't have time for this, you know… 

01:43:50
PETER PEARSON Doesn't have what? 

01:43:55
DOMINIC She doesn't have time like, I mean, you're, you know, what you want, you know aren't very sure of what's going on, and where you come from, and what you need and I. Where the fuck I come from? 

01:44:15
ARIELLE I'm also very sure that I felt like, a lot of why I'm here is 'cause I want to know that like I wasn't gonna leave him, you know, I don't like what did they like she'd hit fan and things got rough and things got hard and most people would have walk away. I didn't leave. And I wanted some part of me wanted to like prove that to him because, I know what he's been through. And I thought that would make him respect me more, but I don't think it has. 

01:44:55
ELLYN BADER Can I ask you something that'll has this last time brought all of this more to the surface than it's ever been? 

01:45:05
ARIELLE I don't know, I don't know. The answer to that question I mean, what the time it happened, two years ago. I mean, I thought that we would be, we went to therapy. We, a lot of conversations about it and, you know, I thought that we… I thought that we'd, he'd changed. 

01:45:25
ELLYN BADER And, listening to Arielle, I felt an enormous amount of compassion for her because in fact, she does really understand something about the kind of pain he's been through with his father's suicide, and what that's really like for him and so she wanted to prove to him that she wouldn't leave him, and that he wasn't going to have to endure a painful loss with her the way he had with his dad, and also through the divorce. However, also she's got somewhat of a noble justification here for staying and, and not acting on the other side of her and part of that is umm… If I make you need me, you will know how much I love you, and then you won't leave me, and so it also in some way feeds the insecure part of her as well. 

01:46:20
ARIELLE There's a lot of like, he put pressure a lot of things like his feelings are his like, react… reaction and how he really feels, 'cause, he doesn't want to hurt me or he doesn't upset things. Very obvious to me so, I ask those questions and he's doesn't ever felt comfortable being honest about them, if he… and I just stand at the point right, it's like, you know, like I said I, I've showed him, I've, it didn't leave, you know, and I don't want, I don't want this want, I didn't want this, but I've don't. I don't know how much longer I can pull myself into this. 

01:47:05
PETER PEARSON It's a legitimate question, you know, that you're asking of yourself. It's totally legitimate. 

01:47:15
ELLYN BADER How quickly would you each like to see a decision being made? One of the reasons that I asked the couple about how soon do you want to make a decision is that in the aftermath of infidelity, in a crisis situation like this it is so, so common for a couple to feel urgent like we absolutely must make a decision right now, and yet the emotional pain is so intense that they aren't really able in some ways to make the best decision for each of them and so, I was asking them about how urgent did they feel like they had to make a decision today or could that decision be delayed somewhat as they each allowed themselves to sit with the impact of this session, and a better understanding of what was going on for each of them, and then be able to make a better decision. 

01:48:10
[sil.] 

01:48:20
DOMINIC I'm so upset, down right now. I don't even… 

01:48:25
ARIELLE He goes from here to here. Here to here, and here to here. 

01:48:25
DOMINIC I dislike wake up and just look for reason to be happy that day, I don't know. 

01:48:30
ARIELLE Some days he doesn't want to be with me at all. Says, we're both miserable, both unhappy. Let's not be together. 

01:48:40
PETER PEARSON And then other days this guy shows up. Over there, and he shows up and you start to hope or think possibilities. 

01:48:50
ARIELLE Very well, I just can't like, like I can't take it anymore. Like, my boundaries these are that like, I physically, emotionally, cannot take anymore. Like you don't want me, you don't want this, you can't commit to me, then let me go. 

01:49:10
PETER PEARSON And then this guy shows up. 

01:49:15
ARIELLE I can't take anymore. 

01:49:20
PETER PEARSON Uh-huh, and I think both of these sides are beginning to realize that you cannot and will not take anymore. I guess maybe there's a difference between I won't take anymore and I can't take anymore? There is actually a big difference psychologically and emotionally between I can't take it and I won't take it. I can't take it is a way of diminishing accountability and reducing your power. It's a lower differentiation concept. By saying I won't take any more, you actually start to claim your power and from a more differentiated position say this is my boundary and I will not take any more. By saying I can't, it killed it… Keeps you in more of a helpless position like well, I can't help. That's as far as I can go. Which is different than saying I will not take any more, this is my line. Do you think there's a difference? 

01:50:25
ARIELLE I feel like if I say I won't. I might regret it. 

01:50:30
PETER PEARSON Umm…Okay. 

01:50:35
ARIELLE I'd say, yeah, couple of months down the line I'd like take myself like, convey just try a little harder or for a little longer, figured it out, and we could've been what we to and I just, you know… 

01:50:50
[sil.] 

01:50:55
ELLYN BADER So then you don't. I mean, then you stay right where you are. 

01:51:00
[sil.] 

01:51:05
ARIELLE Yeah, I mean, I'm in love with him, you know, it's never wavered until now, you know, so. 

01:51:15
ELLYN BADER Let's switch back seats. 

01:51:20
PETER PEARSON Is there anything from over here from the guy that would like to make a commitment? So anything that this alter ego would say to this guy over here who's afraid of it. Is there anything that you would say to him from the chair that you're in? 

01:51:30
DOMINIC Leave me the fuck all, I don't know. Oh, god damn schizophrenia, I'm fucking lunatic, Umm… like I know, it's healthy and I know what's good for more, I know, it's… what the possibilities are. I'd just… I don't know he just shows up. Like, you said. 

01:52:05
ELLYN BADER But, there, there is a voice over there that says leave me alone? 

01:52:05
DOMINIC Yeah. 

01:52:10
ELLYN BADER And I know what's healthy and good. 

01:52:10
PETER PEARSON This guy's had years of conditioning over here. Years of self protective walls built up, years of independence, years of fear of losing too much with a commitment. So, he's just… he rattles the cage a lot. 

01:52:35
DOMINIC Yeah. Damn man! 

01:52:45
Ellyn & Pete check-in with each other before wrapping up the session. Arielle and Dominic remained in the room for this discussion. 

01:52:45
ELLYN BADER I feel the urgency for some decisions to get made that they're each expressing in different ways. Umm… I also wonder what it would be like to take the pressure off of that decision for some defined period of time because the conflict is so much on the surface now in terms of the part of him that wants to be a different kind of a man than his father. And the kind that's entrapped by all that, that he saw and that is scared of what commitment will make him end up, living like his dad. 

01:53:25
[sil.] 

01:53:30
ELLYN BADER And it seems like that's so much on the surface now that if he were to stick with that and really wrestle with through, getting through it they would both be able to make a better decision. 

01:53:45
[sil.] 

01:53:50
PETER PEARSON Your question earlier when you asked, how soon would you like to make a decision, I mean, the easy answer is right away so I can stop the pain. 

01:53:55
ELLYN BADER Yeah, right exactly. 

01:53:55
PETER PEARSON So, I want to make it as soon as possible just to stop the pain, but you're not going to make an intelligent decision. Uh… At this point there are too many conflicts and uh… I'm thinking about the part of Dominic, that saw the price that his dad paid for being committed and how that commitment ended, you know, to a lot of depression and finally to end the pain he walks in front of a train. As a way of escaping that pain and not finding a way through it differently a hard process of being able to make the emotional risk of saying this is what's going on within me, this is what I'm struggling with. And to have somebody married to somebody who can say tell me more about your desire? And how you're compromised yourself, and how you're slowly sucking the oxygen out of your system and now you want to die, tell me about that. Those are conversations that not too many couples can have. The couples that can have those kinds of conversations are rare and they often find something extremely valuable going through that. Uh… it's kind of like diamonds. Basically, the only difference between diamonds and pencil lead is heat, pressure, and time, in case, they're both made out of carbon. Now, The way I think the world is good for having pencils, I like pencils, and I think the world is also good for having diamonds, but we get, we, we as humans get to choose. If you want to create a diamond kind of relationship it would take heat, pressure, and time. Uh… We don't get there just because we wanted it. The challenge is without knowing what the outcome is going to be, if we know the outcome of it's gonna turn out all right then, we, we'll sign up for the challenges, but when we don't know that's what makes it so darn hard, and I think that's what we're faced with, but so I like the idea of can you take the pressure off of having to make a decision. Although, in the back of your mind it's like, yeah, as ain't gonna be forever? I'm not going to stay like this forever. So is the balance between trying to take pressure off and creating a larger space. 

01:56:20
ELLYN BADER We're creating space to work on the, the cracks up where they're really stuck right now, each to them as individuals, but it's played out. But, I was thinking is that I have enormous respect for both of you. There are very few people as young as you were that are willing to face this kind of stuff, you know, I've been working with couples now for 30 years. There's not much I haven't seen, and I've seen those people who are really willing to dig into the hard stuff and grow from it and those who run away from it. Every couple has something that's tough at the core. Everyone that I've ever seen has something tough at the core. I would love to see, you find a way if it works for you to take the pressure off the decision a little longer, but also know that you're going to work really hard over the next couple of months to find the answer, that's the right answer that you both know it's the right answer, one way or the other, but not to make it quick to avoid the pain that you're in right this minute. And I don't know how that sounds of that sounds worse or better. 

01:57:45
ARIELLE It makes sense. 

01:57:45
DOMINIC It makes sense to me, I just, I know who you're looking for, you know… 

01:57:55
ARIELLE It doesn't help when you say things like we're both miserable and unhappy. 

01:58:00
DOMINIC So it take sometimes… 

01:58:00
ELLYN BADER Can we change that? Can I make suggestion at least for the next little while, but instead of saying we're both miserable and unhappy to say we're both going through some mighty fucking growing pain, right now. This is, I mean, this is what growth and development is and it stinks sometimes. 

01:58:25
DOMINIC It's difficult 'cause we live together too, so it's like we've lived in it every day. And, and will have like glimmers of like being carefree and, you know, being really like nice to each other things like and that like flip of the switch like all that can like comforting and then we just be like cruel to each other, rude.

ELLYN BADER Yeah, 'cause, you're scared of what's coming. Arielle is clear. She loves you, she would like to be with you. And you're scared to open up again that makes sense, but I do think it would be really helpful to take the pressure off for a little while and just say we're not taking the pressure off of dealing with the conflicts, and the conflict for you is how am I myself? How my back to my self-confidence? How my back to my self-esteem in the face of going through all of this? How do I touch back to the real me? And yours, really is much more of how do I deal with the kind of man I want to be? How do I really resolve that internal conflict around? What type of man do I wanna be? And that you're doing that side by side right now, together. And it's not right now the decision of whether you wanna be together and not be together, it's how do we resolve these two issues and then make a better decision. 

01:59:50
PETER PEARSON So we had potentially for you guys come back again you guys want to come back again? And the reason you would say, yes, it's what, so you get another helping a reality here that doesn't sound very good. 

02:00:05
ARIELLE No. It's pretty. And this is the most influential therapy session that we've ever had together, I would say. The most… real. 

02:00:15
PETER PEARSON Real. Real in the sense of what, Arielle? 

02:00:20
ARIELLE Umm… Being like in touch of what's going on inside I think, in like feeling, uh… for him and I know, but just understand me I guess. 

02:00:40
PETER PEARSON So Dominic you're willing to come back because… 

02:00:45
DOMINIC I like to caught on camera. 

02:00:45
PETER PEARSON Just what she thinks, I'm ready to toss him out of the window. This is what he comes back with! Jeez! There's that you smack him with something. 

02:00:55
ARIELLE He's funny. 

02:00:55
PETER PEARSON God damn! Uh… sure. Make all this harder for it. Sure come here becoming endearing and charming. Is that right? Jesus Christ! Uh… let's not have more compassion for you, Arielle. 

02:01:15
ARIELLE Thank you. That's it, will do. 

02:01:15
PETER PEARSON Thank you. We'll see you in couple of weeks… 

02:01:15
ELLYN BADER Yeah, we'll talk to you soon. 

02:01:20
DOMINIC Thank you both, I appreciate it. Thank you. 

02:01:20
ARIELLE Thank you very much (inaudible ). 

02:01:25
PETER PEARSON Thank you. 

02:01:25
ELLYN BADER Thanks. 

02:01:25
DOMINIC Thank you very much. 

02:01:25
PETER PEARSON Lets not give you a hug. Alright, thank you man. 

02:01:25
DOMINIC Yup. 

02:01:30
ELLYN BADER What they ended up deciding to do after this session and after they'd had some time to really digest it, was I thought a really good decision, which is they decided to stop uh… living together, not stop working together, and still each of them spent time with their own individual therapist really focusing on some of their own issues. And then uh… they did go back to their couples therapist, but only to see her intermittently as they put the primary focus for a period of time on what they each needed to work on for themselves. 

02:02:10
PETER PEARSON Actually a decision to live separately for a while can be a good decision for some couples to do the separation before they exhaust all their goodwill. And often couples will exhaust all their goodwill and then say fine it's over, it's done. Uh… but, for some couples coming to a decision to split before that point of goodwill exhaustion occurs can be a good decision, so that they can come back together and build on some of their strengths. 

02:02:40
ELLYN BADER And I think, for them it was positive to recognize that they each had some significant work to do as individuals that they weren't able at this point yet to fully commit to a marriage.
