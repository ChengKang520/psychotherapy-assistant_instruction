RICH SIMON Welcome, everyone. My name is Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker, and your host for this series, which is now coming to its conclusion on the emotion revolution. So, over these, uh, last weeks, we've looked at the issue of emotion and bringing emotionality and the energy of emotion in the most productive way into psychotherapy. Today we're gonna deal with maybe the fundamental question many therapists face as talk therapists. Sometimes talk gets flat. It seems like the therapy goes flat, a little bit stale. And what do we do about that? What does it tell us about what we're doing or not doing? And most importantly, how do we bring a quality of vitality into our sessions and we have an expert on that topic, who's really developed a whole approach of psychotherapy. Um, of accelerated experiential dynamic psychotherapy to address that issue. And let me welcome our guest today Diana Fosha. Diana, how are you? 

00:01:20
DIANA FOSHA Thank you, Rich. Pleasure to be here with you again. 

00:01:20
RICH SIMON So, let's start with your-- how you got interested in this issue of vitality and this is this is a term that, uh, you and I have spoken, that-- 

00:01:35
DIANA FOSHA Yeah. 

00:01:35
RICH SIMON . . .you're using as kind of a barometer of, uh, what's going on in therapy. So, what was it about your-- what did you, was that something that you immediately experienced in your, uh, introduction to psychotherapy in your early training? And how did you come to focus on that? 

00:01:55
DIANA FOSHA I think it's sort of something that I think of in retrospect when I look back at my own trajectory. And, you know, what's that connecting line between the many different phases. I'm not sure that vitality is something I would have talked about at that point. But in fact, it's really where I linked all of these different phases. It's always sort of what attracted me about those out there, or those approaches or those pieces of work that I found particularly resonant with authenticity or vitality. And it's something I'm sure we'll end up talking about. You know, the, um, the corresponding emotional response that it evoked in me as I was engaged. Many things were interesting, many things were compelling, but there are a particular writers - Winnicott is one that comes to mind. He's a particular favorite of mine who always seemed to evoke in me that experience of vitality it was in his writings and his (inaudible ). So I think that you know, sort of from very early on, um, was something that I just always responded to. Uh, so I think that was one piece of it. The other piece of it was that, um, my original training was psychoanalytics, psychodynamics, psychotherapy, which is a very powerful interesting, complex mode. I always think of my education of the classics, right? That's where I learned Latin and Rome-- Latin and Greek. That's (inaudible ). But at some point, I became concerned on issues of effectiveness, and the length of treatment and, um, really being able to evaluate by some external criteria or functional criteria. And one thing led to another, and I just got following this track, interested in short-term dynamics, psychotherapy, which is sort of, uh, psychoanalysis on steroids, to use a current phrase, which is trying to have the same kind of depth and intensity and yet, doing it in a limited time frame. And that initially took me to the work of David Mallin. And then it took me to the work of Davenport. Um, and that is really where the emotion story begins because what made that work so powerful and so effective really had to do with how to rapidly access very visceral access to emotions. We're not just talking about feeling angry or feeling sad. There's anger or sadness or fear, whatever the emotion being talked about. It's in the body, it's in the room, it's between the people. It's not a narrative. It's actually being experienced. So . . . 

00:05:15
RICH SIMON So let's get at that in a, in a practical way, um, in terms of when you're doing your, uh, training and therapist in your method. So, one of the marks, one of the, the concepts, one of the skills for the craft of your method is attunement. 

00:05:35
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:05:35
RICH SIMON Is the therapist being attuned not just listening, not just listening to content. Talk to us about attunement and the role of attunement and particularly how, in a first session, you-- how, what do you do? How do you attune when you're first meeting with a client? 

00:05:50
DIANA FOSHA Um, I mean in a first session, really starting from the first moments and sessions is a long time. Um, of course, I listen to content, I listen to the person's story and what-- I don't track narratively, or I don't track themes. I really track a likeness. I track vitality and I track little glimmers of emotion. Um, and when they appear, right, and now I'm thinking, when they appear, it becomes in the process of where we're shifting background and foreground. So, the person is telling their story, why they're coming, what they're upset about, what happened, what led to them seeking treatment, their difficulties, what have you, very often there's a lot of emotion that's sort of flowing underneath. So, when I start to notice that, just by closely looking at eyes or face, or like a little smile like you just had, . . . 

00:07:05
RICH SIMON You're pretty sharp, there. 

00:07:05
DIANA FOSHA Right. Just something like that, that becomes an entry point. And at that point, I might really just shift the story. I mean, might shift the focus from the story to whatever the moment experiences. So. . . 

00:07:25
RICH SIMON And how will that sound when you do that? So you know, suddenly the client smiles or, and you, you see people's faces and shifts in expression. How do you, so how do you do this in a way that doesn't, uh, distract? What are the kinds of things you might say when you're, when you get those glimmers? 

00:07:45
DIANA FOSHA It doesn't make people feel like you're not interested in their story, or they want to tell you or whatever, that may be. So, I might say something like, you know, "I'm really interested in what you're telling me and we'll get back to it, but I noticed. I don't know if you're aware of it, but I noticed there's a little smile just when you said that. Can we just hang on to that for a minute or two?" And see what that's about. And etc. 

00:08:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. So you're reassuring me that we'll get back to my content and my story, but you're saying I'm really, I'm here with you, I'm really seeing you and if you care to, we can talk about whatever it is that perhaps normally you wouldn't feel comfortable saying whatever set off that glimmer. 

00:08:40
DIANA FOSHA And you said something very important, if you care to. It's a coll-- I ask permission. Is it okay with you if. You know, the person says no, absolutely not, I absolutely have to tell you what my wife did last night, then that might be a somewhat different interaction. Not that we necessarily say okay, I will listen quietly for the next 45 minutes. 

00:09:00
RICH SIMON Right. I hear you. Okay. 

00:09:05
DIANA FOSHA Otherwise, the smile is holding something. 

00:09:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:09:15
DIANA FOSHA So what's that about? 

00:09:15
RICH SIMON So, and then, so that sensitivity to the non-verbal, was that part of your initial training? Was there an emphasis on the little smile, the change of the muscles around the eyes, all of these things that I know you're very, uh, attuned to in the way, in your style as a person and as a, as a therapist. Did, did anybody, did you have any supervisors or trainers who really talked about that early on? 

00:09:45
DIANA FOSHA Not at all, not at all. 

00:09:45
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:09:45
DIANA FOSHA Um, you know, the supervision was thematic and following unconscious lessons and, you know, being sensitive in that way to language. Uh, and manifestations of hidden meaning, and words or that, that people use. But not particularly the face. If you think of it, sort of psychoanalysis does not place a lot of analysis is not done face to face. 

00:10:20
RICH SIMON Isn't it amazing? When you think of that for a moment, well why don't you go in the closet and tell Mary your story to me. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Now, talk to us about-- so you have this term you call micro-tracking. 

00:10:35
DIANA FOSHA Yes. 

00:10:35
RICH SIMON And tell us about micro-tracking. 

00:10:35
DIANA FOSHA So, again, whether, you know, somebody's telling a story about something that's important to them, or we're actually in the heart of some process that's accompanied by a lot of feeling or intense emotion, that's coming up. Something traumatic or there's a loss or what have you. Um, then there's the sort of big thing that's happening and the big thing is the big emotion or the big story that's very meaningful to the person. Yet, there's something-- there are at least two, probably like a million other things, but two other things going on, which is the person's own reaction to their own experience to their own story, and of course, um, whatever's happening between the two people. Somebody's telling me the story or I'm helping somebody, you know, with their grief, right. So there are all of these things going on. And by paying attention to the small things, to the face, to gestures, to intonation, to pauses, to a break in eye contact, somebody's like really maintaining really nice eye contact and all of a sudden their eyes go back, right. Or, they just sort of start to wander. 

00:12:10
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:12:10
DIANA FOSHA Um, it's just paying attention to those, or leaning back or leaning forward, slumping. Actually, it's interesting because, um, one of the terms in emotion theory for the kinds of things we're talking about are vitality affect. We're sort of tracking how vital. . . 

00:12:35
RICH SIMON Vitality affect? 

00:12:40
DIANA FOSHA Right. It's actually a thing maybe Dan Stern, Daniel Stern coined that term in talking about babies. Right, that you have the big emotions, where they're crying or they're having a temper tantrum or they're playful or. . . You have that. But then, around that, it's what's the quality of the vitality aspect. And is it getting bigger, is it sort of losing vitality? Is it rhythmic, is it staccato? And, you know, that being such a way into the brain and the body and some deeper aspects. 

00:13:20
RICH SIMON So. . . 

00:13:20
DIANA FOSHA It's almost commentary. If you think about it, it's almost like nervous system commentary. 

00:13:25
RICH SIMON On the story or the ongoing thing being experienced. So here's the thing about, as you're saying that, so these are the aspects of human communication that really well-mannered people don't discuss. We don't bring this to other people's attention very often. So in some ways, this, uh, micro-tracking violates at least, in most contexts, the spoken rules of human interaction. So tell us a little bit about how you manage to weave this into your psychotherapy in a way that doesn't offend people or many them feel self-conscious. 

00:14:10
DIANA FOSHA I think sort of, you know, one of my allies is that people fundamentally really want to be seen. 

00:14:15
DIANA FOSHA Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:14:15
DIANA FOSHA And there's something about being seen and being seen accurately, being gotten, is a very powerful experience that sort of trumps some of the more social things. You know, that's the deepest way to, excuse me, um, you know, just-- I actually was working with a young woman, very disorganized had a lot of trauma, was actually was coming in for tremendous anxiety that was disrupting her cognitively and inter-personally and in some way not allowing her to function. And at the beginning, her anxiety was so high, she almost couldn't understand literally couldn't understand what I was saying, couldn't quite see me much less connect. And at some point, um, as she was telling me about something, she had a couple of tears down her face. And I just commented on that. And she said, you can see that? 

00:15:25
RICH SIMON How did you say it? 

00:15:30
DIANA FOSHA What are the tears, I notice that as you're talking, you know, I don't know if I'm right or wrong, you tell me. But, you know, I think I saw a couple of tears. What are they about? Something like that. And she said, you could see that? Or maybe actually, in that particular case, she was, you know, again, there was a story that she was telling, or a sentence that she was trying to complete and I just commented. I noticed that as you say that, there were some tears come to your eyes. What's that about. And she literally said, you can see that? You know, and it turned out that part of the tragic experience of this woman, of this young woman, was just the sense of being invisible and nobody seeing her and her going through life in some way unnoticed, uncared about. So, in that moment, of my noticing and commenting, something shifted just in our, just in that interaction. And it was one of those moments where a contact that was not going well, she was so anxious, I didn't know how I was gonna make contact with her. It didn't seem like there was such a natural match between the girl's comments. It's almost like that became the moment of connection that allows me to shift. 

00:17:05
RICH SIMON Now, one of the things that, uh, you have spoken about is the, um, there were two, um, extremes that we often, uh, think about emotionally. The first thing that for many people come to mind is emotion is a big thing. 

00:17:30
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:17:30
RICH SIMON And emotion is on this expressive level and I have rage and I have my deep hurt and I have all these things and we need to get it out. And it's often, uh, when we want to make a caricature of psychotherapy, we make it a therapy to kind of a circus of over-expressiveness. Now, one of the tings you emphasize is this understated, the receptive emotions and that I hadn't heard anybody actually use that term in quite the way that you have. Tell us about receptive emotions and the role that they-- that you think they play in the therapy process. 

00:18:05
DIANA FOSHA Um, so let's see. I mean, all, all therapies, regardless of orientation, emphasize the importance of contact, the impotence of empathy. Now there's a lot of talk about the importance of attachment in psychotherapy and that component in the therapeutic relationship. And a lot of work goes into the training of therapists about how to engage in ways that are empathic or compassionate or attuned, or what have you. 

00:18:45
RICH SIMON Create safety. 

00:18:45
DIANA FOSHA Pardon? 

00:18:45
RICH SIMON Create safety. 

00:18:45
DIANA FOSHA Create safety. Um, be affirming, valuing. . . the list really goes on, you know, establish a secure base. I talk about stuff like that, you know, from an attachment perspective. Um, fantastic. And we have very sensitive people who are in the field and who have big hearts and a lot of compassion and etc, etc, etc. However, that's part of the story and it's maybe slightly provocative, but it truly doesn't matter whether I'm empathic or not, or it matters. It's necessary but not sufficient. What truly matters is the person's experience. Because I can feel deeply empathic, compassionate, and my heart can be breaking. This can be like. . . I can be moved to tears, but if the person with whom I'm working doesn't experience it, doesn't take it in, doesn't experience that, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter one iota. So, that understanding came sort of the interest in really exploring the self, which is okay. Um, when-- like to the young woman before, so, what was it like when you felt seen by me? Um, to express the receptive aspect of taking in compassion or empathy or interest or attunement. And than it becomes this exploration of receptive experience, which is receptive experience or the things that block receptive experience. Right, because very often people who have had trauma or attachment trauma, that's they put up a wall where they don't let themselves take it in. So whether it's a block or an experience, it just becomes a very very important place in which we're tracking the reception of that which the therapist has to offer. 

00:21:05
RICH SIMON So, talk to us about that. When you're. . . so I'm your client and maybe you're, you feel attuned and we've-- we're at a certain point in our therapy where I don't get it, I don't feel that connection with you, whatever it is you're experiencing towards me, and not only you, but other people I can't, there's not a receiving place in me. What are the-- how do you work with that, how do you identify-- what's the issue? How do you identify that issue, how do you work with that issue? 

00:21:40
DIANA FOSHA Right. So, I think in a couple of ways. One is to explore for instance, I might say, "I am very affected by what you're telling me." Or, "I'm moved by it." Or, um, whatever the beginning might be, or that seems really hard, what is it like. . . And then checking in, so what happens when I say that? I don't know, it's just being a therapist, that's what therapists say all the time, right? 

00:22:20
RICH SIMON It's what you're paid to do. 

00:22:20
DIANA FOSHA What you're paid to do, right. You're paid to, to say that. So, I might do that a number of things. If through micro-tracking, I have the sense that the person is actually affected by it in some way, that they're trying not to be, or I see some glimmers of it, I might ask them to just, "Are you willing to just suspend that for a minute, just a minute. Can you just suspend that and then we'll go back to your skepticism. But if you can suspend that, what is it like?" And then they say, "Well, if I suspend that, then it's very nice." But and then we're sort of maybe. . . so that's one example. 

00:23:05
RICH SIMON There's an opening. 

00:23:05
DIANA FOSHA You have an opening, take it. And then if you do enough work with what's actually there, when you go back to the skeptic or the skepticism or the barrier, you find that almost invariably, that it has really softened or it's no longer an issue. So that's one scenario. The other scenario is the person who really I don't feel anything. 

00:23:30
RICH SIMON I just feel dead. I don't-- you know, I just don't have emotions like other people, or I just, I don't know what it is about me. It must be my childhood. 

00:23:40
DIANA FOSHA Right. So I think in that moment, I actually would shift, you know, cause that's such a, that's such a huge wall. It doesn't feel like it's in the moment specifically and a response to what I said or I didn't say. But it's deadness. It's I don't feel anything. I just, I might say something empathic, like you seem really upset about not being able to feel, which by the way, already shifts it. Because if you're upset about not feeling, you're already feeling. Right. So, it's again, finding the little thing where just tell me about your experience of deadness. Tell me what it feels like for you to not have emotions, where's the deadness, what's your experience? Tell me more. 

00:24:40
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:24:40
DIANA FOSHA So it's a negative content becomes a positive content. 

00:24:45
RICH SIMON So you can always go to that meta list, your meta processing, uh, is really another, a really important tool in the way you work. So maybe you can explain a little bit to folks what meta processing means and the role that has and how you help people to explore emotion. 

00:25:05
DIANA FOSHA Meta processing, I mean, um, really involves the exploration of the experience of the experience. So, right? It's not what do you feel? I feel deadness. Okay, that's the first order of things. So, tell me, what about the deadness? What's that like, what's your experience with it? Right? It's sort of like there is no negative communication. If you communicate that you can't, you're communicating to me. You know. . . 

00:25:40
RICH SIMON You cannot not communicate. 

00:25:45
DIANA FOSHA You cannot not communicate, you can walk out. You can walk out and walk out. Um, but as long as there's engagement and communication and clearly I feel dead, I don't feel anything, I don't believe you, I don't think you're sincere, those are all moves towards in the sense of them telling me something about, you know, what. And I celebrate them. So then, we move to this. . . 

00:26:15
RICH SIMON And you celebrate them? 

00:26:15
DIANA FOSHA Celebrate them. 

00:26:20
RICH SIMON That's interesting. I'm sorry to stop, but celebrate them. That's an interesting choice. You celebrate them. How do you celebrate them? 

00:26:25
DIANA FOSHA Um, somebody says, "I don't think you can help me." Um, thank you so much for sharing that with me. It's amazing, wow. That's such-- this is a person I am thinking I trust. I know you're saying you can't trust me, but I really appreciate the trust involved in your being so authentic and honest with me. 

00:26:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:26:55
DIANA FOSHA So, and then that way it's a celebration. It's a wow. Right, so it's, um. . . 

00:27:05
RICH SIMON So just as, so just as you're saying that, just as the old, um, uh, you know, Bateson principle you cannot not communicate. In a certain way, once we get into meta processing, we cannot not feel. 

00:27:20
DIANA FOSHA Exactly. 

00:27:20
RICH SIMON Because at one level you're feeling and then you can always have somebody make a meta reaction to what is it like, as you were saying a moment ago, not to feel? There's always something. 

00:27:35
DIANA FOSHA Exactly. There's always something. Um. . . 

00:27:40
RICH SIMON There's that approach to emotion and psychotherapy. 

00:27:40
DIANA FOSHA The same, what was that? 

00:27:45
RICH SIMON No, it's, you now, she had that rapid-- so it's one thing or another. Remember the old Saturday Night Live thing of, you know, . . . this thing and that. My Gilbert Godfrey is a little bit in mothballs, but basically that's the concept. Now, the key thing, here, it seems is the therapist use of self and the therapist willingness. This is a very-- the way you work, it strikes me as a very demanding way. You can't, you don't take time off, here. You can't just do a uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. It's, so this is, there's no time outs. 

00:28:30
DIANA FOSHA There are no time outs. 

00:28:30
RICH SIMON So how do you help therapists begin to develop a way of using themselves in this thing where it's a continuous session as a continuous thread. There are, there are no recesses of attention in this. 

00:28:45
DIANA FOSHA Um, I mean, therapists care about being effective. And therapists. . . you know, I mean, I think to sort of take a slightly larger perspective for a moment, I think so much in our field has actually trained naturally interactive people and naturally compassionate people who are drawn naively into the field of psychotherapy thinking it's about empathy, compassion and emotion. Only to have that trained out of them. As they learn to be neutral, as they learn to hold back, as they learn to, you know, any number of anti-intuitive, anti-natural, anti-interactive. So that in a way, one of the things that we're doing when we're training therapists is restoring that. And this is actually one of the pieces of feedback that we get. You've made me be in contact again with what made me go into this field in the first place. Right, so that rather than being something difficult, which it is in many ways. I don't mean to minimize the difficulty or that it's rigorous or demanding in its way. One of the things that allows it to be learned and to be viewed is there is something that feels so satisfying about being connected, about being precise, about having a way to express whatever's inside the people who go into this field. Um, so I think that's a natural ally in the same way as, you know, well one ally is if you really want to be seen. There's something about that that's to the heart in the same way therapists want to be able to connect and make contact and use themselves so that's one way to look at it. That's really just sort of, um, giving that permission. However, that's something that needs to be trained. It's not just willy nilly sort of great, wonderful. Um, and the training, again, is in some ways difficult because it involves becoming aware of oneself in ways that are not always so easy. When I first started to do this work and I used video tape in my work and I would watch myself on tape, I found my voice excruciating. I just didn't like the way that it sounded, and I talked too much. It was a very powerful tool to get me to be spare in my language. Um, uh, you know, that's one of the processes involved. And then when it works, it works. So people get me by the fact that it works. And it makes it very alive. 

00:32:20
RICH SIMON So it seems like there are two elements here. One is this tracking, as you put it, tracking your own authenticity. That's kind of a gauge. There's no-- and I don't know if you can get trained to do that, but you can be encouraged to do that and perhaps look at what gets in the way of being able to do that. Maybe it's more that. And in terms of a structure, though, when you do your training of students. So this involves a lot of, uh, more use of self than many more technique driven forms of psychotherapy. So, what are, what's important here? If you had to give us, uh, you can't give us your whole training curriculum, but what's the structure? How do you help people to stay in this moment, track their authenticity and be able to use these immediate reactions in a way that's productive in the therapy relationship? What are the guiding principles in doing that, or whatever whatever method there is in moving people from being beginners at your method to people are more accomplished at it. 

00:33:25
DIANA FOSHA It's safety, safety, safety, safety, safety. We're very, it's a lot of exposure. We supervise and train for video tape. Um, and very often do so in the context of a group. So, you really are exposed. It's not just when you're saying what you're doing and you're not just presenting notes, you know. There it is. (inaudible) Exactly. Exactly. So that's, you know, intense. But, some of the ways of creating safety have to do with the supervisors or the leaders also showing and not just showing perfect work, but showing struggle and showing mess ups, and showing this achievements and showing places where the work goes wrong as well as where it, where work goes right. So I think that's just to begin, so I think that's one. And, um, you know, and there's pieces, the video tape is a huge tool that allows you to be precise. 

00:34:45
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:34:45
DIANA FOSHA And allows you to be precise but out of the action. So you can look at a tape or you can look at a file of a session, you're not in the heat of the interaction when you made this thing, or. . . but you're actually able to really slow it down and see that crinkling of the eyes, or see that you know, micro-expression of disgust or a wrinkle, you know, before the something, the eyebrow. 

00:35:20
RICH SIMON I don't believe in micro. 

00:35:20
DIANA FOSHA I think that's really right. That's why you're doing the job you're doing. 

00:35:25
RICH SIMON Right. I'm a macro guy. 

00:35:25
DIANA FOSHA You're a macro guy. Um, and then, you know, and so it's the experience in an environment of safety and getting to learn about yourself and the people you're working with. But the video tape also allows you to do over, which we don't get in life, which is you can look at it again and you can stop it and say, "Oh look at this." What are you feeling right now? For instance, this might be, let's say we're picking a moment of a missed intervention or a missed achievement. It can be technical, right, the therapist has to learn to a set of interventions, but we might stop the tape and say okay, so what's happening for you right now? Therapists aren't receptive. What are you feeling in this moment as you're. . . So these are some of the ways, and you know, it's an intensive training. It's a parallel process to the therapist. 

00:36:30
RICH SIMON Let's come at this another way. So that's one way of thinking about that, all the moments in therapy where you're watching and oh my, my own experience, watching an interview and you can verbally resonate with the sound of your voice, talking too much. . . 

00:36:50
DIANA FOSHA Right, right. 

00:36:50
RICH SIMON . . . the comments from this thing of, uh, if you just would shut up, this interview could be a lot better. And I feel for the folks out there. Most of the time I do it. Uh, so here, when you want to go to the next step, um, beyond that, when you're. . . is there a structure to how you, in addition to looking at the misstep, what's the structure that helps people to learn how to behave in a, a more attuned way. Or are there sort of, or another way to think about it, are there sort of classic problems that people have? Uh, classic difficulties in addition to talking too much and, uh, and working too hard? 

00:37:35
DIANA FOSHA Yeah. Actually, you know focusing on missed achievements and that kind of stuff is one aspect of it. 

00:37:45
RICH SIMON You might want to move a little bit, take a pause and move for a moment. You might want to shift yourself a little bit so you don't have to dodge. 

00:37:50
DIANA FOSHA Dodge the sun. It's a nice problem to have. 

00:37:50
RICH SIMON See how attuned I am? When you start going like this, I can tell, I can tell you're suffering. So why don't you take a moment and get yourself comfortable. 

00:38:00
DIANA FOSHA And have a receptive experience. 

00:38:05
RICH SIMON And have a receptive experience. 

00:38:05
DIANA FOSHA Um. . . 

00:38:05
RICH SIMON And keep moving if that happens again. 

00:38:10
DIANA FOSHA I can't. 

00:38:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:38:10
DIANA FOSHA We're at the edge, right? 

00:38:15
RICH SIMON All right, so there's a little drama going. 

00:38:20
DIANA FOSHA Um, um, I started to say focusing on miss attunements, what might you do differently, that's one. But actually, in parallel process to treatment, where you know, we celebrate a lot. Um, find the moments that work. Find the moments when little, you know, the therapist may come in and say, "Oh my god, I don't know what I'm doing with this person, you know. I'm just incompetent." Or whatever. And then, sort of much to their surprise, they pop in the tape, you know, sort of okay, let me have it, what am I doing. . . And we find all of these beautiful interactions. Whether they're micro or macro, big or small, and we really stop to take and celebrate successes and really say you're doing it. Because just like with a patient, you're doing it already. Um, And there's nothing like you're already doing it, so do some more of it. What it looks like and this is what it feels like. It's a very very powerful way to train, you've already done it. But let's do it again. Um, let's do it again. So that's one aspect of it. You said, you know, like what are some of the common blocks. One of the most common blocks is the therapist to take in their patient's positive experience, to receive gratitude. As a group of people, we tend to really have a lot of difficulty with taking in positive emotion in that way. So that's a huge part of being able to do this kind of work. Which is the therapists' own blocks to receptive ([inaudible]). 

00:40:25
RICH SIMON One thing that you do that we had a, you know, a previous interview. I had never heard, uh, a therapist formulate in quite this way. We were doing a role play. And there's a way you formulate-- 

00:40:40
DIANA FOSHA By the way, should I do a follow-up? How have you functioned since? 

00:40:45
RICH SIMON Look how cheerful I am after. . . I may have a little, you know, I might choose this time for my relapse. But I've been reasonably well since then. Very good one session intervention. I complement you on that. Uh, and in addition to that, one of the things that really impacted me was when you, you turned to me and you said, "What is it like for you right now to have me and, you know, see you experience this or to have me. . ." and you said something like what is it like you sitting there now. And it was something about that sitting there now experiencing something that intensified that moment between us that gave it this, an edge of immediacy that was really uh, quite remarkable. So, is that something, um, is that something that kind of just intuitively occurs to you, or is that part of the training of helping people to be able to not only sit with their experience, but then being able to translate that into a way of expressing themselves and engaging clients that, uh, that advances the therapy process. 

00:42:00
DIANA FOSHA I mean, that's a therapeutic process and it's actually a very very systematic aspect of the therapy. Um, and it really has to do with drawing attention, experiential attention to new behavior, new experiences, um, transformational experiences that people are having but are not aware of having. So this is in part where all the stuff that we're understanding about the brain and the nervous system when it comes in that a lot of emotional experience gets processed on the right side of the brain. So we're feeling it and showing it and then, uh, we may not know about it. We may not be mindful of it. We may not be aware of it. Um, so I'll give you an example. Again, a particular woman comes to mind with tremendous, tremendous isolation in her life, so isolated that she was quite severely suicidal. Talking about it, and, she had a very connected session, and I've shown this on video tape. She's one of the people who's given me permission to show it. So we had a very connected session. We're working together very closely. You know, she's tracking my face, I'm tracking her face, she feels very understood. She starts out in, in the depths of darkness and by the end, she's talking about the light that's coming in and having some hope and so on and so forth. So I then ask her, so, and I am positive, in controlled experiments, but I'm positive that if we hadn't processed that which I'm about to tell you about, by the time she walks out, she will still think of herself as I am a lonely person who has nobody in her life. She will have had the experience with me, but that sense of self is so strong that, like, the two don't go together. Like, I like my therapist, but I'm a person who's alone in the world. And it doesn't get processed. You know, immediately oh no, I'm just have this incredible experience with another human being where I felt understood and I took some chances and she took some chances. So, by doing it in the different channels, so what is it like, what just happened between us, um, what's that like for you and how do you feel in your body? We're talking about it. Do you see it in my face as we sit together through this thing that we've done together? All of a sudden it empowers our view of dimensions. So you felt it and you're talking about it and you're thinking about it and you're constructing it and it's in your body and it's in the person's eyes. She said this funny thing to me, I said, like you're really paying attention to me. I was, of course, and that's just your facial expression all the time, etc, etc, etc. 

00:45:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:45:35
DIANA FOSHA So all of a sudden, it just becomes something that's so rich and multidimensional that it changes the old scheme if you will. 

00:45:50
RICH SIMON Yup. Yup. It's, it's, there's a book that's, uh, by, uh, the Nobel Prize winning psychologist, the world's only Nobel Prize winning psychologist, Daniel Kahneman, which he, um, talks about system one and system two. 

00:46:05
DIANA FOSHA Yes. 

00:46:05
RICH SIMON I don't know if you're familiar with this, but that's what you're describing. So system one is all these automatic ways that we take in things and what-- where we spend 98 percent of our life if not more. And then that system one is that reflective thing that occasionally system two that challenges system one. And so, what these, this meta-processing technique is, is essentially, um, system, system two's attempt to challenge and perhaps alter this automatic responsiveness that we fit everything in the old categories. 

00:46:45
DIANA FOSHA Exactly. You know, via system three. And system three is that vital alive, genuine experience in the moment, right? It's got, which allows system two to have a really rigorous stasis on which to challenge system one, cause it says look, we just did it and this is how it feels in your body, and you have all this energy and you started here and you ended here and look at what she's feeling. So. . . 

00:47:15
RICH SIMON This is real. It's like you're saying, you know, this is real, this is real, this is every bit as real, perhaps a lot more real than your habitual response to things. And let's not pretend that something real didn't happen right now. Let's feel it and let's just follow where it goes. 

00:47:35
DIANA FOSHA Exactly. Exactly. 

00:47:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah. Now, one of the things that I'm, I'm very struck by, um, and we just have a, a little bit more time, five minutes or so, and one of the things that you've talked about in terms of emotion, again, you have I think you have a nice way of describing certain experiences that I haven't heard described in quite this way. So we have this ideal of expressive emotions and emotions that are very large and we have to get out and are deeply disturbing. And then there's this, when you're talking receptive emotions, they're emotions that are integrative experiences where, um, that were, that sometimes work very quietly within us. What are you talking about there? What kinds of experiences are, are those? And how do those-- your approach to psychotherapy? 

00:48:30
DIANA FOSHA Um, so let me give you an example. I am working with this woman who in this particular session, this particular moment, is really grieving. Um, and is really dealing with a sense of rejection, a sense of disappointment, um, not feeling good enough, and it's a very deep experience that she's having. Um, that she'd been having outside of session, brings it into session and comes to life. And as, as we're working with it and she's really deeply sad, has been crying. Maybe it's a moment before a moment the tears stop, but they're not done. Maybe she's telling me in more detail. I notice a little smile. Very incongruent, incongruous with the content. I mirror it back to her. She's not aware of it. She doesn't know what it is. It comes up again and we catch it. Well, it turns out that side by side with this feeling of disappointment was very deep sense of rejection. She's describing this situation. There's also, you know, cause she's saying she's gonna go to this party and she's gonna be there by herself and alone and she's not accompanied, etc, etc, etc. Um, in this smile is this other piece of it which is this is me. This is who I am. This. . . which is eventually where it leads to, that side by side with my feeling of rejection, side by side with this kind of disappointment, there's this other sense of this is me. And it's some sense of recognition and some sense of really deeply touching the essence of the self. I don't want to use the, these terms loosely. 

00:51:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:51:00
DIANA FOSHA But it feels very deep and it's very quiet. And it turns out that very often, it's accompanied by these little small vitality affects that are positive. A little smile, a little twinkle in the eyes, a little tilt of the head. And when you go in, it takes it to this very very profound place. And where the session led to was through this little subversive path of the smile and actually allowed her to access something that she had never really felt, which is how deeply accepted she felt by her mother. She had always thought otherwise, but then discovered by a whatever we were pursuing that there was some fundamental way in which even though she didn't think so, she realized that her mother in fact, had always wanted a girl and that she was very much wanted by the mother in a fundamental way. And we would have never gotten to that in that session without just making room for whatever that little vitality affect of the smile in the middle of the devastation. 

00:52:30
RICH SIMON So what does this say or how do we give this a little bit of language so that we can take this home? So we have on the one hand, we have, um, our you got me all conscious of non-verbal. . . are you okay with the light coming in? Do you need to duck down or something. 

00:52:50
DIANA FOSHA I'm fine. 

00:52:50
RICH SIMON All right, good. So on the one hand we have this notion of emotion, what is it, the seven classic emotions and we have the biology researchers and their sadness, there's anger, there's disgust, there's whatever that is. What you're talking about is emotion. . . say that again. 

00:53:10
DIANA FOSHA Joy is the one positive affect in the big seven categorical. There's six negatives. . . 

00:53:15
RICH SIMON And one positive, okay. And then we have this whole, uh, domain of experience of vitality affects of these integrative emotions that you're talking about. Can you-- as we bring this to a close, how does, how does, how do they fit together? What's the relationship? We call them all emotions, or at least in this conversation we are. How do they, how do you fit them together? What does one have to do with the other? 

00:53:45
DIANA FOSHA Yeah. I mean, I think that big emotions, and I think these are ideas that I'm only recently, you know, that we've developed and I'm starting to write about them or have done some writing. It's sort of like hot off the press. Um, cause they're becoming clear in the context of this kind of work, meta processing and what we've been exploring. Um, but the big emotions that you're talking about, like everyone talks about, those are all reactions. You know, what happens inside us in response to a disruption. Something big happens out there negative or positive, usually negative, but sometimes positive. And we, you know, feel joy. And we're processing what's happening out there in the environment through these emotions. But from us and our interactions about what's really going on and they get our bodies to do what we need to do to take care of the situation. 

00:54:50
RICH SIMON an evolutionary significance, 

00:54:55
DIANA FOSHA Absolutely. And, you know, they have these action systems that are built into them, and they help us adapt. And we've survived. You know, as a result of that. So that's one category that has to do with our being impacted by the outside world and the emotions express it. The kinds of transformational affects or vitality affects really have to do with our processing, our experience with each other and our experience of self. It's almost like self on self. So that as I sit with you, I become aware of what this process is like for me. Or as I am with my emotion, as I am crying, or as I am enraged because this horrendous thing has challenged me, you know, it's got me incensed. The vitality affects are telling me and you, sort of like, my take, if you will, on this big emotion like it's really big. But, there's a part of me that's feeling some satisfaction that I can express it and I can feel it. And it's not getting suppressed. Or there are some experiences that even though the emotion is negative, my body's starting to relax because of (inaudible ) then this toxic grief or shame, which is counter-intuitive because you are expressing this negative horrible emotion. But these little positive things, sort of start to come on the scene, which they're incredibly important to therapy. They're the essence of therapy that basically says that therapy is working. When you have them in the picture, you're going somewhere, you're moving. So, I think that's really. . . 

00:57:10
RICH SIMON And they're paradoxical in that way. 

00:57:15
DIANA FOSHA They're often paradoxical. 

00:57:15
RICH SIMON And the other connection is, it's a little bit the, uh, what Eugene Genlin, you know, he coined this term. So it's really this felt sense. He makes a distinction between emotions and I think there's an overlap, here, of this other emotions and there's this felt sense that doesn't fit in those categories-- those categories that have been shaped by evolution, the large human survival emotions and, uh, and these evolutionary significance. This felt sense which can be so fleeting and that, and we need to slow down our, the process of things that we can bring them into awareness. 

00:57:55
DIANA FOSHA Yes, again, it's bigger ground. And the felt sense is always there. What we're doing with the felt sense is not just bringing awareness to it, but we really start to mess with it and play with it and really take it as the starting point of a whole journey. You know, sometimes it leads to bigger emotions and. . . 

00:58:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. Okay. Well, speaking journey, we're at the end of this hour-long journey. And I am sure that there are many people out there who were curious about well, what the next step for them might be about finding out more about your work and training opportunities and resources and so on. Where do they go? 

00:58:40
DIANA FOSHA www.bedpinstitute.com. 

00:58:45
RICH SIMON Okay. Very direct answer. 

00:58:45
DIANA FOSHA That's sort of the entryway. There's some books and articles and trainings and a lot of materials. 

00:58:55
RICH SIMON Okay. One stop shopping. 

00:58:55
DIANA FOSHA One stop shopping. Yeah. This has been a wonderful conversation, Rich, thank you so much. 

00:59:05
RICH SIMON And let me take in positive and give you right back. I feel the same way. Lots of fun and the conversation needn't end with Diana and I, as we, uh, engage in our mutual admiration here. But let's invite, uh, the rest of you into this, uh, uh, collective admiration society. So, if whatever it is, whatever your thoughts, your questions, your critique, whatever, bring it on here. And you see the comment board on the screen. Please share that let this conversation continue. Diana has agreed, I don't guarantee she'll respond, but she'll take a look at the comments and we'll see in this unpredictable way, where the conversation. . . 

00:59:50
DIANA FOSHA Responsive so. . . 

00:59:50
RICH SIMON Okay, there you go. I, I sensed that at this point. Thank you so much. Uh, really very what a fun way to spend an hour and what an interesting conversation. So, on behalf of Wellness, thanks to you, Diana.
