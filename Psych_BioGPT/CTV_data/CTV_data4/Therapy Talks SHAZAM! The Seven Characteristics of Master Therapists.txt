THERAPY Talks Paul Peluso, Ph.D. 

00:01:30
PAUL PELUSO Today, I wanna talk with you a little bit about superheroes and how they relate to master therapists. Actually, I'm only gonna talk with you about one superhero and it's probably a superhero that you never heard before. But stay with me on this. I think it is really important if you wanna learn, ah, keys to being a master practitioner. So today, I'm going to talk with you about Shazam and who was Shazam. Well, Shazam was a superhero created in the 1940s and 1950s. It was the story of young Billy Batson, a 12-year-old orphan boy sold newspapers on the streets of New York City. And one day, because he was such a good-hearted boy, he had a pure heart, ah, a, a strangers takes him to an underground lair where he meets the wizard Shazam who for 5000 years has been guarding the people of Earth from evil and, and, and black magic and whatnot. And the wizard is dying and he needs to pass on his (inaudible ) his powers onto somebody. He needs to find somebody who is good and pure of heart and he gives Billy Batson his powers. In order to summon his powers, all he has to do say the word out loud "shazam" and a magic lightning bolt strikes him and transforms him from a 12-year-old weakling boy to a strapping huge superhero who can fly and stopple(ph) and the like. Now, the thing with Shazam was that it was actually an acronym. The name Shazam was an acronym for the seven ancient wi-- wise men who gave Shazam his powers. The S stood for Solomon and he got the wisdom of Solomon. H stood for Hercules and the strength of Hercules. A stood for Atlas and the, the might of Atlas holding up the planet. Z was for Zeus and the powerful thunder bolt of Zeus. A was for Achilles and the, the, the invulnerability of Achilles. And M was Mercury and his swiftness. And all those wor-- letters together - S, H, A, Z, A, M spelled Shazam. And yes, Shazam was powerful and, and fought the po-- the, the powers of evil and the only thing, the only thing that could defeat Shazam was copyright lawyers. Yeah. Uhm, it turns out that Shazam was published by Fawcett Comics and there was another comic book company called DC Comics and they thought that a caped superhero was a little too close to one of their caped superhero with a big red S on his chest so they sued Fawcett Comics and they had to stop publishing Shazam. Now, the finding is about, a couple of decades later, DC Comics got the right to Shazam. So now you're starting to see Shazam back out there again but now you know. So what is it all this have to do with psychotherapy and with master therapists? Well, I think just like Shazam, the name is an acronym for these characteristics from, ah, the ancient wise people, ah, that give Shazam is powers, I think that all master practitioners have seven personal characteristics that you see evidence in their therapy. 

00:04:50
Personal Characteristics of Master Practitioners 1. Curiosity 2. Collaboration 3. Optimism/Hope 4. Pattern Recognition 5. Self-soothing 6. Mindfulness 7. Irony 

00:04:50
PAUL PELUSO And I think that all seven of those combined are what really make for a master therapist masterful. Those seven are curiosity, collaboration, optimism and hope, pattern recognition, self-soothing, mindfulness, and irony. And I think when you put those all together, they form the-- well, no, actually they don't form a good word like "shazam". I think the best I could come up with is like SHIPCOC so we're not gonna try that one. But we'll talk through each one of those together. So, first let's talk about curiosity, curiosity. It's the best place for clinicians to start. Curiosity actually comes from the Latin word "cura", C-U-R-A which means to care for or to cure. Now, if you think about that, isn't that what we do in psychotherapy. We try to care for our clients and we try to effect some sort of change and some sort of improvement. 

00:05:45
Paul Peluso, Ph.D. 

00:05:45
PAUL PELUSO And, and curiosity for a master practitioner is the starting point for building report. You watch masters at work, you watch any videotape series with a, a master practitioner and you'll see them following their curiosity when they're listening to a client story. And they've learned to hone that skill and trust that skill and I think that it's, it's, uhm, amazing, amazing tool that most master practitioners will use. People who are naturally curious tend to like more complex, ah, and, and more rich dynamical, ah, ah, ah, concepts. And I think, again, if you look at the master practitioners at work, you'll see elements of that. 

00:06:25
The only cure for boredom is curiousity and there's no cure for curiousity. DOROTHY PARKER 

00:06:25
PAUL PELUSO Actually, Dorothy Parker had a great, great quote. She said, "The only cure for boredom is curiosity and there's no cure for curiosity." So, let's talk about collaboration. Collaboration. Henry Ford said about collaboration, ah, coming together is the, is the beginning, ah, staying together is, ah, is progress, but working together is success. So, with collaboration, it's a, it's a stance that the therapist takes of working together with the client. Gone are the days of the therapist or the, the practitioner, or the doctor, ah, knowing all. Now, in order to be successful, you have to develop that democratic stance with the client. Now, collaboration doesn't mean that, ah, therapist doesn't participate, doesn't, ah, ah, you know, come together and it doesn't mean that you just go wherever the client wants to take you. It's a joining together of both the client and the counselor's talents and abilities. In fact in some research, uhm, two researchers Tyron and Winograb did two separate meta-analysis on outcome, ah, ah, studies looking at collaboration. And they found in one meta-analysis that 89% of the studies that use some form of collaboration, ah, had better outcomes. And they also found on their second meta-analysis that even though it was a medium effect size for it, ah, collaboration was a, a factor all on its own. There were no moderating variables or mediating variables with it which meant that therapists who activated that had a better likelihood of having a successful outcome. So collaboration, you watch the masters at work. You'll see, ah, evidence of that collaborative stance. The next one is optimism and hope. Optimism and hope. And we're told by Dante in his divine, divine comedy the Inferno that over the gates to hell there is a sign and on it is written "Abandon hope all ye who enter". And if you think about clients when they come in to therapy, if they are demoralized or, or depressed they have abandoned all hope and that their situation, their circumstances are really pretty hellish. That's a really good description of where they come in to. And, and Frank in his 1961 classic Persuasion and Healing said that, "The client comes in to therapy to be cared for and that the therapist must activate hope in the client," must find some way of activating that. Now, how do they do that? You know, did the-- does the therapist just become this, you know, pollyannaish cheerleader "Yey!" No, not, not exactly but there is a bit of cheerleading that goes on in therapy. But I think if you watch some of the best master clinicians you will see evidence of them being optimistic, of them having that hope for change to occur. Ah, in fact, oftentimes you'll hear an old saying that they trust the process, that maybe they might not know exactly where a session is going to be but there is a fundamental belief that anytime a, a counselor and client can come together, there's the potential, the potential for something good to come out of it. So that's optimism and I hope and I think you see evidence of that when you're looking at the, at the master practitioners at work. The next one has to do with recognizing patterns or pattern recognition if you will. And I think that this is, ah, ah, one of the, the hallmarks, the hallmark evidence of, ah, working with, ah, with master practitioners. You will see them looking for whatever that, that central theme is to a person. 

00:10:05
Paul Peluso, Ph.D. 

00:10:05
PAUL PELUSO Now, regardless of whether you call that personality style or if you call that lifestyle or attachment sk-- style or schemodynamics(ph), uhm, a view of self, a view of role, a view of the other, whatever that is, people are creatures of habit and we tend to organize around central themes or behaviors. So for example, if somebody has an avoidant personality style, you're gonna see elements of that in a lot of their behavior. By being able to recognize patterns it allows for master practitioners to be able to take from different areas and behaviors that just don't seem to be related to one another and link them together and that's when you see some of the most masterful work being done when clients will be talking about all sorts of different stuff and the master practitioner can take them together and weave them together into a coherent whole. Now, the other thing they do with this pattern recognition is they, they, they look for both the a-- adaptive and the not so adaptive side of any given behavior. So, for example, if a person is coming in a more avoidant style well, there were probably places and times in his or her life where that avoidant style was important and useful and got them something. But then there are other areas in their life where it's not so useful, it's not so helpful and that becomes the focus of therapy and being able to help the client determine which is which. So I think that's the useful part of pattern recognition and a clear hallmark of, ah, of master practitioners at work. 

00:11:40
KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON 

00:11:45
PAUL PELUSO The next is self-soothing and you can go all the way back to the beginning with Freud or you can come here to the 21st century and the work of neuroscientist looking at your neurons. But at the heart of it all, there's going to be some emotional activation in clinicians when they're dealing with client strong emotion. And I think that that activation is not necessarily bad in and of itself but how clinicians react to it become the thing that can be very, very difficult. The, the best practitioners, the master practitioners will be the ones who know how to manage that, who know how to use that and feed that back into, ah, the, the therapy work. I think new, younger, novice clinicians have difficulty with that. They fear that, they try to tap that down and, and the problem is as they're trying to control their own emotional activation, ah, they wind up sending a message to the client that it's not okay, that it's not helpful to be sharing this strong emotions. And I think that can negatively impact therapy. You're not as likely to see that when you look at the master practitioners at work. In fact, the work of Whitaker and Napier when they wrote the Family Crucible, they talked about therapy as being, ah, a crucible and the therapist as being a crucible. Now, what's a crucible? Well, that's any kind of container that in a chemical reaction is used to contain the chemicals that are put together into mix and transform into something else. But it's the chamber that does not degrade or does not, does not fall apart when the powerful chemical reaction is happening. It doesn't react with the, ah, the ingredients in there. So, if you think of therapy and the client or clients working with each other and trying to change and grow, the therapist holds that reaction in there but doesn't allow their emotions to bleed into that. 

00:13:40
Paul Peluso, Ph.D. 

00:13:40
PAUL PELUSO It's not that they're not feeling the emotions, it's just they know how to sew themselves and be able to keep the focus on the client which leads me to the next one, that is mindfulness. Now, mindfulness is a hallmark of a lot of modern approaches today from dialectal behavior therapy to acceptance and commitment therapy and other mindfulness based approaches. It's a principle that comes out of eastern philosophy. Ah, but it's very much at home today in psychotherapy. It's this idea of bringing a person back into awareness of what's going on around them and being aware of their circumstances and their situations without being too distracted and, and going away. Ah, it's also used to help, ah, help clients change their relationship to their problem or their circumstance by directing their focus back into the now or into the present. So mindfulness is important particularly when you have clients who want to a-- avoid or ha-- have high anxiety and want to project fears and anxieties into the future. So, again, you can see there where there's a linking between self-soothing and mindfulness and bringing, ah, the client into the session, into the room. And I think in order to do that, therapists have to be mindful of that. It's what allows them to be able to distinguish what's going on in terms of content and process and being able to work on those two levels simultaneously, ah, and sometimes even, uhm, ah, at the same which actually what simultaneously means, is it? So moving on from that, ah, the last one that I wanna talk about is developing a sense of irony and this is, this is born out of the idea that sometimes life is just cruel. And our clients come into session knowing that and for a therapist to have that sense of irony is a recognition of the, the difficulties sometimes in life. Uhm, some historical example of irony. Ah, think about in 1981 when president Ronald Reagan was shot, ah, shot at when leaving a, ah, hotel. The reality is, is that he was not struck by any of the bullets that were fired from the gun. Instead, he was struck by a bullet ricocheting off of his limousine. His bullet proof limousine that was designed to protect his life instead ricochet the bullet, had entered his chest and came very close to killing him. 

00:16:10
Paul Peluso, Ph.D. 

00:16:15
PAUL PELUSO That's a definition of irony for you. Or another famous one, ah, from politics is the, ah, iconic picture of Harry Truman holding up, ah, an, an edition of the Chicago Tribune on election day 1948 where it says, "Dewey defeats Truman." Well, apparently the Chicago Tribune printed out a little too early because Harry Truman actually went on to defeat Dewey but that's irony right that. And we see it in, in, ah, session all the time. Ah, it's in terms of being able to help clients focus on those areas of their life that maybe they are trying to pull away from or maybe that they're not feeling very comfortable or very, ah, confident in. It allows them to open up new possibilities, new avenues, ah, in terms of, in terms of their thinking by pointing out the ironic aspects of where they're, they're fi-- finding themselves. Ah, the best classical example of that has to be, ah, Oedipus and the Riddle of the Sphinx. The answer to the, the riddle that Oedipus had to, ah, had to answer was himself. He was the riddle of the sphinx so that's ironic, ah, use of, ah, ah, of, of character in there. 

00:17:20
Personal Characteristics of Master Practitioners 1. Curiosity 2. Collaboration 3. Optimism/Hope 4. Pattern Recognition 5. Self-soothing 6. Mindfulness 7. Irony 

00:17:20
PAUL PELUSO So put together curiosity, collaboration, optimism and hope, pattern recognition, self-soothing, mindfulness and irony I think are the seven characteristics of all master practitioners. I think just like Shazam, if you can take in those elements and start to develop them in yourself then you too can take on those, ah, those characteristics of master practitioners and change your way of doing therapy or improve it if you haven't done that. As you are listening, if you found some of those, ah, that you resonated with and that you are already naturally doing, I would encourage you to keep doing it. But if you haven't or if there are some of those areas that you haven't developed in yourself then find videotapes of master practitioners, take a look at them and see if you can pick out elements of those seven, of curiosity, collaboration, optimism and hope, pattern recognition, self-soothing, mindfulness, and irony. And then lastly, you know, if you happen to have a very difficult client and you know that you're gonna need some extra help, you can always just say the word shaza-- well, you know, the rest of it. Thanks. 

00:18:35
THERAPY Talks 

00:18:35
SHANNON DERMER Well, thank you for a very interesting presentation. There's a few things I wanna, uhm, ask you about it. But first I have to say, did you see the Andy Griffin Show-- or Griffith? I never... 

00:18:45
PAUL PELUSO Andy Griffith Show, - 

00:18:50
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:18:50
PAUL PELUSO - absolutely. 

00:18:50
SHANNON DERMER Listening to Gomer Pyle, he used to say, "Shazam!" Yeah. 

00:18:50
PAUL PELUSO Actually... 

00:18:55
SHANNON DERMER Well, you did that really well. 

00:18:55
PAUL PELUSO Thank you very much. Mimicry is one of my only marketable skill. 

00:19:00
SHANNON DERMER Only marketa-- you say, say it with that, ah, southern accent. I know-- I think I talked over it so you have to do it one more time. 

00:19:05
PAUL PELUSO Shazam! Shazam! Shazam! 

00:19:05
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:19:05
SHANNON DERMER Thank you. Uhm, that sort of reminded of-- but I have to ask you that if you're gonna come up with a sup-- now, I'm putting you on the spot here. If you're gonna come up with a superhero for either yourself or for the master, ah, therapist, would it-- what would it-- what would his, his or her powers be? And what would, ah, his or her name be? 

00:19:25
PAUL PELUSO Oh, wow. I'm, I'm, I'm a huge comic book superhero fan boy, geek. I really, really am so, uhm, you know, Iron Man is one of my favorites. Uhm, but I think-- and, and, you know, maybe Iron Man would be in some respects a good role model for, for therapists. Maybe not so much in others, the billionaire playboy part, maybe not a-- as much. But, you know, the story of Iron Man is he's, he's wounded, ah, you know. He, he derives his powers from a, ah, a device that's necessary to keep him alive, to keep shrapnel from hitting his heart and he becomes changed in that process from being, ah, a, ah, a, a, a very, uhm, self-centered jerk kind of to somebody who tries to, you know, save the world and save other people and brings together the Avengers. So, I think Iron Man, you know, might be one of them. But, uhm, ah, but someday I think I'll probably say not so much. 

00:20:20
SHANNON DERMER Right. Well, that's good cuz I didn't warn you I was gonna ask that question. So-- and I had to say from what I remember of the Iron Man character I saw that sometimes his power also weakened him and he had to take care of himself and do things to help himself evolve so that he could continue to help others. 

00:20:35
PAUL PELUSO He, he did. Actually, he was also one of the, the first, uhm, superheroes to have a, ah, type of substance abuse problem. Yeah, and there's a, a great series of, of where they had to, you know, discussing working on his, his, ah, alcoholism. So... 

00:20:50
SHANNON DERMER So, let's go into that. Every superhero is perfect and then there's every, ah, therapist or counselor. 

00:20:55
PAUL PELUSO Yeah. Exactly, exactly. 

00:20:55
SHANNON DERMER Hmm. Very good, very good. Uhm, so I want to ask you and maybe I missed it when you're speaking but where did you come up with the seven, seven characteristics? 

00:21:05
Paul Peluso, Ph.D. 

00:21:05
PAUL PELUSO Well, as, as part of, uhm, ah, the, the book that just came out of was the, ah, Principles of Counseling in Psychotherapy. Ah, uhm, in the first edition of that book we came up with seven domains that all master practitioners work in. And when it came time to the second edition, uhm, I started thinking about cuz I was watching a lot of the, the master therapist tapes, ah, and I began to think about what is it about them personally that seems to match along with each of the seven, ah, domains. And, and so there are things like, uhm, you know, working with schemodynamics(ph). Well, you know, people who work with schemodynamics(ph), you know, the master practitioners really focus in on those, uhm, on those, ah, ah, you know, patterns and, and recognizing those patterns just seem to be good at that. Uhm, and I think that that's, that's the skill that gets honed over time but it becomes a personal characteristic. You know, you talk with them outside of therapy and they're noticing patterns all around them. Uhm, so-- and part of this it was, it was also, uhm, I think motivated or inspired by the work of, uhm, Jennings and Skovholt in their work on master therapist. They did, ah, ah, they did a, a I think a Delphi study on it, ah, and look at the personal, ah, characteristics of, of master therapists. Uhm, it was more about what they do but that kind of became, ah, inspiration for me to look at these, these, you know, dispositions or these characteristics of, of master clinicians. 

00:22:30
Shannon Dermer, Ph. D. 

00:22:35
SHANNON DERMER So was it almost like, ah, a qualitative or a content type of analysis as you're watching these tapes, they use all these patterns up here? 

00:22:40
PAUL PELUSO Ye-- yes, because I, I, I was looking for the, the domains. So like, ah, ah, you know, listening and responding or assessing, ah, or building therapeutic relationship. And as I was looking for them, I saw this personal characteristics, you know. The optimism and hope or the self-soothing when they're dealing with emotions. I just saw there's a nice parallel between them and I, I think it's an effective, ah, you know, metaphor for working with students and trying to get them to maybe incorporate and brace some of these elements of master therapists. 

00:23:10
SHANNON DERMER You know, I think that's great actually when you are training or supervising because I think a lot of times, uhm, clinicians in training just try to mimic what they see which is part of learning. 

00:23:20
PAUL PELUSO Uh-hmm. 

00:23:20
SHANNON DERMER But I think that, ah, that's a lot of content. They're just trying to mimic what they see and I think that, uhm, allowing them to watch, ah, videos of master, you know, therapist but then also having this in the back of their mind which is really the process of what they're seeing - 

00:23:35
PAUL PELUSO Yeah. 

00:23:40
SHANNON DERMER - is really helpful for them to try and integrate, you know, some of that. 

00:23:40
PAUL PELUSO Yeah. The, the, the sub-- the subtitle to the book is, you know, ah, has to do with the, the non-linear thinking of master practitioner. So I'm, I'm very interested in helping students to think like therapist and just act like therapist. I think that's really, ah, almo-- almost a lost art in our field. But I-- it's one that I've seen in the last 10 years starting to really come back and that, that makes me feel very encouraged. 

00:24:05
SHANNON DERMER Let's get-- I, I, I had noticed that as, uhm, trainees are moving from, ah, mimicking or just copying what they see, what they do is-- and you kind of alluded to this, they start to take their own personal attributes and they make the model their own. 

00:24:20
PAUL PELUSO Yeah. 

00:24:20
SHANNON DERMER So, yes, they are doing structural or are they doing experiential or, you know, uhm, ah, emotion-focused therapy and you can see that in what they're doing. But then you also them, they're personalizing it. 

00:24:30
Paul Peluso, Ph.D. 

00:24:30
PAUL PELUSO You become for lack of a better word, intimately entwined with the work that you do. Uhm, and, you know, it's not like other professions or other fields were, you know, you can leave it at five o'clock and, and, you know, you leave the office version of you behind. Ah, it really does become if you do this long enough, you know, part of your, your, your personality. Part of the core of who you are. 

00:24:50
SHANNON DERMER Now, as a marriage and family therapist, I've talked about a lot of types of intimacy but never model intimacy before where you become intimately involved with your model but I think that, that probably is a good, ah, you know, metaphor that there is intimacy that's involved when you become specially a master, - 

00:25:10
PAUL PELUSO Uh-hmm. 

00:25:10
SHANNON DERMER - master therapist. Who are some of the models that you look up to? I'm talking about people, not frameworks, that you look up to as like the quintessential master therapist. 

00:25:20
PAUL PELUSO Oh gosh. There, there are, are so many of them. Some in danger of probably not remembering a couple of them. But, ah, you know, folks that, that I had personal interaction with that really, you know, shaped me. Uhm, Gus Napier was one of them. Ah, he, he was one of my early supervisors, uhm, when I was coming out of, out of school. Ah, Jon Carlson, ah, for sure not just with his video series but, you know, to be able to, you know, work with him, you know, co-author some things with him. Ah, Jeffrey Cuttler I think is, you know, one of the other, you know, great masters. Ah, folks like Sue Johnson, uhm, you know, ah, other folks like John and Julie Gottman are folks that, you know, I, I would look up to. Ah, I just think, you know, do incredible, incredible work. Ah, and then even some of the more historical figures. Ah, folks like Alfred Adler or Carl Rogers, uhm, you know. It's, it's funny. I watched Roger's Gloria tapes now and I see so much more, ah, to what he did than what I did when I was, ah, you know, a developing students. So, you know, I, I think it's important to see those videos. Ah, I also think it's important, I did this with my students, to make them watch an entire session. Not just the highlights cuz I know when I was coming along maybe you'd see the highlights and you, you got this mistaken notion that that was what therapy was all about. That there'll be one great insight after another and set you up to these lot of kind of other things that go on. There's lot of lulling points that, that go on between those kind of great moments. 

00:26:40
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:26:40
SHANNON DERMER Now, that's an excellent point because I do tell, uhm, I do tell trainees and I let people sometimes see me do, you know, counseling or therapy. And I'm gonna be like, you know, when I come in to your session, when I'm doing live supervision, you know, you might see this awesome moment. I go about most of counseling or therapy when you watch it, it's quite boring, you know. 

00:27:00
PAUL PELUSO Yeah. Yeah. 

00:27:00
SHANNON DERMER So, you're right. When they just see those moments they think, "Oh, this is how you're supposed to be all the time," but, you know, actually there's a lot of stuff in between. 

00:27:05
Paul Peluso, Ph.D. 

00:27:05
PAUL PELUSO Absolutely. But, but then it's also realizing that, you know, the masters at work even though it doesn't look like they're doing much, boy, there's a lot going on there and that's where learning that, that thinking process, - 

00:27:15
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:27:20
PAUL PELUSO - ah, of what they're listening for and then how they're relating all of this stuff to, ah, you know, to, to what the client is, is saying to maybe a central theme or central idea that then provides us kinda jaw-dropping moments. 

00:27:30
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, that's a good point that even in those quiet moments there's a lot of in the master's therapist mind a lot of thinking and processing, you know, - 

00:27:40
PAUL PELUSO Uh-hmm. 

00:27:40
SHANNON DERMER - going on. Uhm, we're, we're running out of time. I think it's, ah, a lot of, ah, people wanna talk more about like, "How do I become a master therapist?" We don't have time to go into all that but you did give the blueprints, uhm, for that which I think is, ah, great. Cuz like you said, that gives them the, the process that they can look for as they're watching some of this master. 

00:28:00
PAUL PELUSO And, and I would just say watch video, watch video, watch video. And now it's so much more readily available, ah, that I think it, it, it just makes it, you know, a, a, a must-do. 

00:28:10
SHANNON DERMER Well, good. That's a great piece of advice and I wanna thank you for your presentation and for, ah, all of your characteristics of the master therapist and your view on, ah, what a good, uhm, superhero would be for a counseling or therapy.
