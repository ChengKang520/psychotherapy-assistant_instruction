00:00:00
UNKNOWN Peter, we made a couple of DVDs together before, we made, ah, counseling confidentiality and the law. 

00:00:05
PETER JENKINS Uh-hmm. 

00:00:05
UNKNOWN We made a confidential space and we're looking at the law again today but with quite a specific thing in lined. What are you looking a t? 

00:00:15
PETER JENKINS What I want to talk about this morning with you is to look at a particular case that relates to the counseling and psychotherapy. And it is the key case to, to understand as a therapist if you're concerned about issues of professional negligence. And I know that for many therapists, the whole area of the law tends to be somewhat intimidating or a bit scary and certainly the prospect of ever been sued or appearing in, in court to be sued by a client is probably something that cau-- would cause most of us sleepless nights. In fact, the likelihood of that happening is probably quite remote. There is only a single case that I've been able to discover that's been written up at appeal court level so it does holds some authority within the English legal system. And it is a fascinating case on its own merits but I think it's particularly interesting because of what it can tell us as therapist in terms of how do we practice safely, how do we avoid damaging our clients, how do we stay within, if you like, the tramlines of acceptable professional practice. 

00:01:40
UNKNOWN It's interesting you say with this, this one case because I'm thinking about present practice, the necessity for insurance, ah, everyone's anxiety about stepping over those tramlines in some inadvertent ways. 

00:01:55
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:01:55
UNKNOWN You, you're saying, "Actually, it's a very rare event." 

00:02:00
PETER JENKINS I think that's-- there are different levels to this. I mean, clearly, there's a lot of, ah, encouragement the therapist to take out professional and damage insurance and, ah, there is, in fact, a huge market for this. And it does have a role to play but in reality the, the number of successful cases, legal cases brought against therapists is very small in this country. It's much bigger in the, in the United States. That's not to say that professional and damage insurance is not important or not necessary. It, it is there as a, a form of support or insurance should-- might be needed. I think that's-- the likelihood of therapists facing professional complaint is actually probably higher so we need to rebalance our anxiety if you like. Uhm, sho-- if I talk briefly about this particular case as, as, ah,-- and I mean, we can look at it as a, as a, as a case study almost in terms of what are the, what are the realistic risks to, to therapist from the, the legal system if you like regarding cases brought by a client against a therapist. The case is that of Alice Landau versus Dr. Theodor Werner and this was the legal case which dates back to some therapy that was held almost 70 years ago. I mean, this is really going back a long period of time. 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:03:35
PETER JENKINS And very briefly, the situation marks that Alice Landau saw Theodor Werner, the-- her psychiatrist, her, her therapist for a period of, of 24 sessions of therapy. But interestingly, this folds into three distinct periods. In the first period, a therapy was from March to August 1949. I mean, even (inaudible ) the dates it's, it's, it's kind of-- it does situated within a particular historical time. At the end of this, this first period of therapy, there was a gap, there was a break in the therapy and according to Alice Landau there was a period of what was termed social contact between herself and the therapist and then the therapy resumed and this went from March 1950 to January 1951. So you have a two periods of therapy with a break in between. 

00:04:40
UNKNOWN With this social contact we wonder what... 

00:04:40
PETER JENKINS With social contacts, ah, which-- and this was really the essence of her case against the therapist that what was the nature of the social contact between herself and, and the therapist. It's really on this that the, the case rest. Having completed the second tranche of therapy which ended in January 1951, she then made a suicide attempt in April of the same year and what then happened was that she brought a legal case and very briefly this is under civil law so this is not a criminal case against but this is within civil law and there are various tests for the case to be successful. The case is heard and needs to be decided on the balance of probabilities. It's a bit of a legal jargon - 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:05:35
PETER JENKINS - but the argument is really that Dr. Werner had probably acted on professionally and probably negligent and probably caused her harm. So that's just sim-- simply to put in some kind of legal box, if you like. So she brought a case and this was a case which was initially successful and the grounds where that he had been guilty of willful misconduct and/or negligence. So she won her case against him and he then appealed and we fast forward to 1961 and the appeal was heard in the court of appeal and the case that she was presenting was then challenged by Dr. Werner. He was seeking to overturn the verdict - 

00:06:25
UNKNOWN Previous... 

00:06:30
PETER JENKINS - that he had been guilty of professional misconduct or had been negligent and had caused her, her damage. So that's the case in the nutshell and it's, as I say, it's one of the few that's written up in any level of detail. 

00:06:45
UNKNOWN Ah, and yet-- I'm just, just conscious(ph) you're talking about a period of 10 years in this, ah, kind of meddle. It stretched on through their lives for a long, long time. 

00:06:55
PETER JENKINS Yes, there is this 10-year gap between the, the ending of the therapy and the case being heard initially at the court and then him appealing and going to the court of appeal which is a fairly senior level-- it's a-- of, of the English legal system. And I'm not sure that, that time span would apply now. There are limitations on when actions can be brought. But that act post states this particular sequence of events. 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN So that's the case? 

00:07:30
PETER JENKINS That's the case. 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN So now we start to the look at it? 

00:07:30
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN I, I guess I have to ask what was the social contact which she complained of? 

00:07:40
PETER JENKINS Well, this was the really the knob of the case because the, the legal case that she brought against Werner rested not so much on the therapy that she had but exactly on what was the nature of the social contacts is rather a controversial period between the ending of the first period of therapy and restarting of the second therapy. Now, Dr. Werner's case was that the social contact had been effectively part of the therapy. In that, he was concerned that by ending the therapy in a very precipitate way that she might return to what he described as a state of, ah, anxiety neurosis that had brought her to therapy in the first place. So there was a period of contact between the two, there were letter for example that, uhm, she wrote to him, there was a number of visits that he made to her at her flat, and there was also a talk about a weekend away together. So this was the nature of the social contact between the two. It was part of her case that sexual contact had happened during this period of social contact but this was strenuously denied by Dr. Werner. 

00:09:10
UNKNOWN It begs all sorts of questions that... 

00:09:15
PETER JENKINS Well, this is why such a fascinating case because there is a certain kind of dryness in the way that it's reported within the legal press but is certainly as a therapist. It begs all kinds of questions not just about professional conduct, ah, but also about the therapeutic relationship and modality that was being used. You know, Dr. Werner described himself as a, a psychoanalytic practitioner and so part of his argument at the appeal court level was that the social contact was part of his therapeutic method and he described to the judge, one can imagine the surprise to the judge mentioning the electron transference, that in the, the course of the, the therapy a great deal of emotion had been activated on the part of Alice Landau which was directed at him as a therapist. Of course it's his transference. And it was in order to, to work with the transference that this period of social contact, the kind of lessening of the intensity of the therapy was so crucially necessary. 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN So, the-- there, there seems all sorts of things going on here but I'm, I'm thinking of how the therapy had ceased and yet there's this almost keeping an eye on her to see she's okay on one level but also now, he's saying this is part of the therapy, ah, and I'm wondering was she aware was part of the therapy. The, the normal questions coming to (inaudible ). 

00:10:54
PETER JENKINS A-- absolutely. I mean, and I supposed at the end of the day it's impossible to know exactly what was going through the minds of, of both parties. But certainly, ah, the outcome, as I say, was that she made suicide attempt at the end of the termination of the second lot of therapy. And, ah, so she brought her case that she, in fact, had been damaged by the who therapeutic process including the social contact, ah, that the social contact had included sexual impropriety on the part of Dr. Werner which is I say he denied. And also lost of earnings that because she had made the suicide attempt, she's be incapacitated, she had been unable to work. So there's a whole series of legal issues which are related to the nature of the therapy and, and with the process of the therapeutic contact between the two. But it's now shifted to a legal process, if you like, a formal court process. 

00:11:55
UNKNOWN And she won her case. 

00:11:55
PETER JENKINS She won her case. 

00:12:00
UNKNOWN What did she have to prove in order to do that? 

00:12:00
PETER JENKINS Well, there are various crams. I mean, I, I supposed we need to be courteous as therapists and not to overstate the importance but it is really classic case of professional negligence and that based on medical negligence law and this is branch of law that goes back to the 1930s and we know that medical negligence cases are now a huge industry and that they cost something like £1.3 billion at the moment affecting the, the NHS. There's a very simple three-stage test for professional negligence case and the first point that has to be established is that the, the doctor or the therapist and, of course, Dr. Werner was both owes the patient or the client a duty of care. Now, we have to unpick then what actually is the duty of care but essentially it's to, to work and to relate to the person in accordance with professional standards. So that's the first hurdle. The second hurdle is that there was a breach of this duty of care by the therapist towards the client. That is that they, they did something they shouldn't have done, they failed to do something that they should have done, again, which was in, in accordance with acceptive professional standards. So far, so good. So that's two out of three but the, the third test for successful case of professional negligence is that the breach of the duty of care directly caused foreseeable harm to the patient. So reasonable person could have looked at that breach and said if you do-- did that, then that is gonna have a damaging effect on the patient or the client. 

00:14:05
UNKNOWN And she succeeded. 

00:14:05
PETER JENKINS She did succeed. I mean, I, I guess it raises all sorts of questions because if this is the only reported case at appeal court level since 1961, then what does this say about the counseling and psychotherapy profession? Does it mean there, there is very little professional negligence, does it mean that, ah, we are very, uhm, professional as, as a, as a community that, ah, this is a very unlikely event to happen or is it simply-- it's extremely difficult for clients to win this kind of case in, in accord of law. The other thing I should say is that the, the bar, the definition, the threshold for harm is set at the very high level. So harm isn't-- doesn't include normal thing and emotions like anger or disappointment or having a sense of grievance. But it has to be a psychiatric condition which is capable of being diagnosed by the DSM-IV, the DSM-V now or ICD-10. So it has to be something at the order of clinical depression, generalized anxiety disorder or post traumatic stress disorder. It's set at a very high level. 

00:15:25
UNKNOWN I gue-- the, the thing that's occurring to me is that long ago she would have had much less choice about where she go from the address. I think about professional bodies. Ah, she probably, you can tell me if I'm wrong here, she probably had the choice between needs of putting up with it or taking a course of action that she took. If, if she didn't take that course of action, he'll just carry on practicing and there will be no change, is that correct? 

00:15:55
PETER JENKINS Yes, yes. I mean, I, I supposed that the, the alleged instance took place at a particular moment of time. We're talking about 19-- the early 1950s, the case went to court, as I say, in the early 1960s. The professional body that he would have been accountable to would have been the GMC, the General Medical Council and that was partly relevant and reference was made to the GMC, was then the blue book fitness to practice and of course it's always been the case that the, the GMC has prescribed sexual contact between medical practitioners and, and patients, uhm, although this was strongly denied by Dr. Werner and was never proven so that was-- wasn't a particular material to, to this case. What we have under English civil law is a very high bar for claimants who want to bring a case against the therapist in this type of context. They have to prove that they were owed the duty of care which is almost taken as red, there was a breach which could be established by reference to codes of practice and the ethical framework and so on. But then this third level that was the breach which directly caused substantial harm, foreseeable harm of a psychiatric nature and I mean-- and I think we could begin to unpractice because in this unusual case what Alice Landau was able to, to demonstrate was that shortly after the cessation of the therapy she had attempted suicide so you could argue and she successfully argued that this was directly related not so much to the first or second period of therapy but the emotional disruption caused by the social contact. 

00:17:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. And the court was assessing his competence. How did they do that? 

00:18:00
PETER JENKINS A number of ways. I mean, the-- you can imagine the difficulties that a civil court even at, ah, appeal court level. How does a court know what is a therapist duty of care? How would they know if what a therapist did was in breach, in fact, if the therapist were to argue convincingly as Dr. Werner attempted to. Social contact was justified by the nature of the case. So you can imagine the judge scratching his or her head and deciding, well, how on earth would I know. Well, of course, the way that a court will decide on what they see is fairly technical matters is to bring him expert witnesses. So what they would need to do would be to bring in, in this situation people who are familiar with an analytical way of working in therapy and the evidence of all the expert witnesses was that working using transference is the basis of your therapy. You couldn't then introduce social contact that this is mixing oil and water, it's counter therapeutic and cannot be justified by any reference to any text or any established way of working within the analytical process. So expert witnesses would be called in, they would give, ah, their evidence. In theory, they're not supposed to be partisan, they are there to advise the court within practice. You very often get a situation where you have an expert witness for one party and an expert witness for the other. Again, it's, it's really important the expert witnesses not seen as a very derogatory term, as a hired gun, but they are there and they will be impartial and not simply presenting the evidence which would support the case of the person who ultimately will be paying their, their fee. 

00:20:05
UNKNOWN And the first time the weight of argument from these expert witnesses - 

00:20:10
PETER JENKINS Uh-hmm. 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN - led the judge to, to decide that there had to be a breach that essentially he was guilty. 

00:20:15
PETER JENKINS That's right. I mean, if you remember the case was brought in two grounds. One was on willful misconduct and the other was on negligence. Now, interestingly, the judge decided that Dr. Werner had not been guilty of sexual impropriety and they absolutely absolved him of any misconduct on those grounds. It's interesting to know on what basis the judge could be so emphatic. Uhm, perhaps that was representative of a different set of worries of, of-- at the time cuz, of course, we know through research, we know through a great deal of writing about this, ah, from the 1970s, '80s and onwards particularly fueled by the, the feminist movement. Third, sexual abuse within therapy by unfortunately has been said, male therapist against female clients is a matter of substantial and continuing concern. I supposed the judges' decision predates a lot of that, - 

00:21:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:21:20
PETER JENKINS - that kind of discovery. 

00:21:20
UNKNOWN So while he was denying the sexual contact, but he wasn't denying the social contact, ah, which we would see as being unprofessional. 

00:21:30
PETER JENKINS Yes. They, they-- the, the judge was convinced that the expert witnesses who, who spoke to the court their evidence was all one way saying that social contact was completely inimicable to psychoanalytic psychotherapy. There was no way that it could be justified even by the particular demands of the case as Dr. Werner was saying. So the outcome of the case was that Dr. Werner was found to have been professionally negligent by mixing the therapy with the social contact and this had caused harm to this patient, it had directly contributed to her suicide attempt, her inability to, to work and support herself afterwards and damages was set at £6,000. Now, that may not sound a great deal of money. I think roughly would it amount to about £100,000 now, today's values. So it's not in the millions. It's a substantial amount of compensation that would have been paid to, to the, to the patient. 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN So what else will court be looking at when they were considering his competence? 

00:22:45
PETER JENKINS One thing that the court would be very interested in would be what is the nature of the evidence which would the case brought by the, the client. And unusually in this case, Alice Landau had letters that she was able to produce as evidence. 

00:23:00
UNKNOWN From Dr. Werner? 

00:23:00
PETER JENKINS From Dr. Werner. I think to and from Dr. Werner so there was documentary evidence. And the courts are very interested in documentary evidence so if there had been records of the therapy, again, these are not mentioned, but we know that currently solicitors are very interested in obtaining records of therapy. Clearly, they would depend on what was in there-- in the record and it will be unlikely that the record of therapy would necessarily demonstrate professional negligence on the therapist cuz I thought they are the one keeping the record. But it, it would assist the court. So, the court would also look at relevant codes of ethics and the one they did refer to was the General Medical Council, the blue book. I guess these days they would also look at professional statements of ethics like the BICP ethical framework or healthcare and professionals council code of conduct as a way of trying to establish what exactly were the professional rules and regulations that apply to, to the therapist. So that's the nature of the evidence that the court would, uhm, look at as well as oral evidence examination, cross examination in the, in the court by the, the, the plaintiff and the defendant and also by the, the expert witnesses who might also produce written reports and submit into the court. The, the key question here is, again, probably unfamiliar to most of us as therapist and this is the notion of what is the standard that is applied and this is, this is the question. I supposed to put it rather bluntly is, how bad do you have to be as a therapist to be worried that you might fall foul of professional negligence? And the standard that's applied is one that will be immediately familiar to anybody working in NHS anyone who's a medic, anyone who is a nurse for example but probably will be unknown to most therapist. This is called the Bolam Test. What is the Bolam Test? The Bolam Test is a legal test which is applied by the court in cases of professional negligence and what this particular case did is established that that medical test also applies to therapist. 

00:25:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:25:30
PETER JENKINS And the standard is, did the, the therapist, did Dr. Werner fall below the standard of practice of a competent, respected, professional carrying out this type of work? 

00:25:50
UNKNOWN So good enough? 

00:25:55
PETER JENKINS Good enough, yes. It's-- so it's a mainstream standard. So was this person working to the standard that could have been expected of any ordinary competent analyst working in the field of therapy at that particular time because the temptation is, I think, that we may be, be inclined to try to apply a standard that has been developed to a change over time. So what is crucial is that the standard that's applied to Dr. Werner was the standard applying in 1949, 1950, and '51, not the standard which might have been developed and applied in 1961 or whatev-- a subsequent date if you like. So it's a relative standard, it's relative to the rest of the profession and it's relative to the time of the, the alleged professional negligence. 

00:26:50
UNKNOWN Along the strength of that, he failed that test. 

00:26:55
PETER JENKINS That's right. Yes. I mean, in a nutshell the court applied the standard and it has enormous implications of us as practitioners because in a sense, as therapist, we are tied to this quasi-medical standard of professional practice. It's a normative standard, it's relative to the, the mainstream practice at the time. So did we follow what was broadly accepted to be good practice at the time. Not the best practice, not excellent practice, simply good enough practice at that time. 

00:27:30
UNKNOWN Well, I guess the thing I'm thinking is this was a long time ago, ah, and it would be easy to imagine, well, it was such a long time ago, it's, it's kind of (inaudible ) we almost can ignore it. 

00:27:42
PETER JENKINS Uh-hmm. 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN But I think it's saying something quite different that this has real relevance to contemporary practice. 

00:27:50
PETER JENKINS I think it does because it, it's sets therapy very firmly within this medicalized model of judging what is competent practice, how do we distinguish between competent and incompetent practice. So this is the Bolam Test. There are various refinements to this being that again you, you say that there's this long gap of time and we might look at practice very differently now. Uhm, it may be possible for a therapist to say social contacts might be inimicable to psychoanalysis but there are therapists who argue that social contact is not necessarily counter therapeutic. Arnold Lazarus for example, the multimodal therapist, in the states has argued I think very persuasively that social contacts between himself and his clients is not necessarily damaging. I mean, for example he says that he might meet with one of his client socially, ah, might have coffee with them, might play tennis with them, and because he's not working in a psychoanalytic way that this would necessarily be damaging. The, the risk is that you could have other schools of therapy who will criticize a particular therapist as being negligent. You can imagine a CBT therapist saying, "Well, there was no, uhm, exploit, there was no thought diary, there was no risk of assessment carried out or whatever." But these might simply be differences of professional opinion. It doesn't mean that by criticizing another modality that you established that it's necessarily negligent. So there are subsequent case-- cases which make very clear that simply because an expert might disagree with a particular practice, it doesn't mean necessarily that it's damaging to the client or the patient. Different doesn't mean bad in that sense. 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN I need to go back a little bit and just check out this Bolam Test. 

00:30:00
PETER JENKINS Okay. Yes. 

00:30:00
UNKNOWN Ah, to think if we, if we move to a present day - 

00:30:05
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:30:05
UNKNOWN - all those modalities, - 

00:30:05
PETER JENKINS Uh-hmm. 

00:30:05
UNKNOWN - ah, are we saying that it would, let's say, as a CBT therapist - 

00:30:10
PETER JENKINS Uh-hmm. 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN - which finding themselves held against this test. 

00:30:10
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN Would it be what we would expect a good enough CBT therapist today or any therapist because of the differences? 

00:30:20
PETER JENKINS None. I mean, ah, I think you're absolutely right that the what-- the, the Werner and the Landau case has established is that setting the standard for professional negligence relates to modality and that's a very important point. Otherwise you can imagine it would be unfair because you would have, ah, person centered therapist who is being criticized by an expert witness who is very psychoanalytic saying, "Well, there's no discussion of transference. No counts of transference." Of course that doesn't fit with a person centered approach. So it's modality specific so that it's competence is measured against the practice of a particular school and there we get into some very interesting discussions. How big does the school has to be - 

00:31:10
UNKNOWN That's the one. 

00:31:15
PETER JENKINS - to qualify as a school and it can be a very small school. But if it has some established body of, uhm, of thought, of irrational perspective then you can argue that the therapist behavior and, and practice was consistent with that school. So it's-- the law is very cautious I think not to impose a sort of uniformity on practice because the risk is that, that would just mean that you solidify practice at a certain time, it will then become very difficult to, to change practice all the time, to develop new approaches or, or whatever. 

00:31:55
UNKNOWN Okay. What else is, ah, about that case that we need to learn today? 

00:32:05
PETER JENKINS Briefly in terms the, the, the standard of, of, of care that therapist need to, to follow for the broad range of therapist and clearly it's to work as a competent professional, we have to follow ethical and professional guidelines interestingly that there are some latest spin offs and one is the standard care for trainees or students and we might assume that that would be lower than for someone who is qualified that again, if we dig in the case law then in fact the standard of a student or trainee is the same as a competent, qualified professional. 

00:32:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:32:45
PETER JENKINS So there isn't a lower standard. Again, that's, that's matter of surprise I think to most of us as therapist. This is really based on the, the learner-driver principle that if you're driving a car on the road then the standard that will be applied in a court is you have to be able to drive even though you have the old plates. So there is I, I suppose a slight area of worry for those who have-- for students or trainees that at the end of the day, we have to be performing as competent, qualified professionals. 

00:33:20
UNKNOWN I was just the trainee. It's not good enough. 

00:33:25
PETER JENKINS It's, it's not an argument that would, ah, actually therefore I find (inaudible ) and the other thing to be aware of is again if you hold yourself out to be an expert then you're judged at a much higher standard. So therapist should be very, very cautious about claiming expertise in trauma or working with children. You have to be able to substantiate it. There will be a higher test that is applied. You have to be very careful not to be hoist by your own petard here. So those were a couple of implications, the others are I think and as you mentioned, the rarity of this particular case is striking that we have one case at appeal court level which really makes a lot of questions. Certainly, I think that it does demonstrate-- it's very difficult for clients to bring successful cases in a civil court to demonstrate beyond, uhm, on the balance of probabilities that the therapist had damaged them by a breach of the duty of care. 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN And I guess that is the difficulty, to prove the damage. 

00:34:35
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:34:40
UNKNOWN You can, you can prove perhaps by diaries, letters, whatever that something happened but to prove and it did this to me - 

00:34:45
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN - is a tougher act. 

00:34:45
PETER JENKINS Yes. Yeah. And I think that it certainly is to the disadvantage of, of clients particularly those with kind of psychiatric history or history of taking medication or any kind of personality difficulties or relationship difficulties which predated the therapy. What I suspect is that Alice Landau had not had a history of making suicide attempts before the therapy. 

00:35:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:35:15
PETER JENKINS So she can argue very convincingly that it was only following the period of social contact, the resumption of therapy that the impact of this had been to precipitate her or suicide attempt. Now, if she previously had a history of making suicide attempts before she went to the therapy then I doubt that this case would even gone to court. 

00:35:40
UNKNOWN Because there was-- they-- that would be evidence that there had been no impact. 

00:35:45
PETER JENKINS Well, the, the... 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN Or it was unprovable. 

00:35:45
PETER JENKINS It was unprovable, yes, that's right. I mean, the solicitors have their own language, they talk by test of causation and the, the critical point is not that there's a breach of duty of care because that, that may be demonstrable. But there is the breach that had caused the psychiatric injury. Now... 

00:36:05
UNKNOWN It's interesting now because what you're saying is that the therapist can breach that duty of care but as long as it happens not to damage the client of appears not to damage the client. They can get away with that, have I understood that? 

00:36:25
PETER JENKINS I think not that, that they get away with it but it becomes very difficult for clients to bring a winnable case in a civil court against them because it, it really is an uphill struggle. First of all, they may have the evidence, there may not be the letters and, and the council records may not support their case. That, that's one, one difficulty. But the other difficulty is that if they come with a history of psychiatric intervention, they might have had hospital terms, they may have made, uhm, suicide, suicide attempts in the past or self-harm then it becomes very difficult to argue on a strictly legal point of view that the breach of therapist duty of care had directly cause the suicide attempt. The counter argument is that there were a high risk suicide attempts anyway and they might have been trying to commit suicide in spite of - 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:37:20
PETER JENKINS - the therapy. So that their, their legal case begins to come apart at that point. Having said that, I mean, there are quite a number of, uhm, solicitors I think who are very unfamiliar with the world of therapy and I've known of incidents where clients have wanted to bring a legal case and solicitors said, "I cannot see a basis for this." It's only when the client points them to Werner versus Landau that the solicitors have said, "Right, I've got it. I have a template now. I know what we need to prove." But for many solicitors, uhm, I think this is a very kind of untested area and I think a lot of commentators have written about this and said that the, the area of professional negligent in therapist is going to expand and reach American proportions, it hasn't happened. It simply hasn't taken off. And then-- but, of course, what has expanded has been the role of professional complaints - 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:38:20
PETER JENKINS - cuz the distinction which we need to, to bear very much in mind is that to bring a professional complaint to a body like BICP or UKCP or ACPC is simply for the client to establish breach of the first and second of the three conditions. First of all, that the therapist owed a duty of care which is almost - 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN Evident. 

00:38:45
PETER JENKINS - ob-- ob-- obviously stating. But secondly, there had been a breach so the therapist had done something which both the regulations have failed to do something. And, of course, that would be sufficient grounds to win a professional complaint. 

00:39:00
UNKNOWN But they don't have to prove the third thing that harm this course by that. 

00:39:05
PETER JENKINS That's right. I mean, that's, that's a really important distinction and I think on the one hand that it, it explains or perhaps turns to explain why there had been so few successful cases brought through the courts for professional negligence. It really is this difficulty of proving the third point that the-- it is the breach that caused the psychiatric injury. 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN But outside the courts, within the professional bodies, there are only two things to prove. 

00:39:35
PETER JENKINS Essentially, yes. I mean, so that a client who's bringing complaint on the professional complaint procedure would only need to establish, first of all, that there was a duty of care, and secondly, that they're having a breach of some kind. Now, that might begin to explain a much higher volume of professional complaints against therapist compared to this very low level of successful legal cases. That's not to say that cases aren't started in the court or settled at the court. I mean, there, there is some indication of that does happen but it's the cases which are proven in court which are absolutely a rarity under the English legal system. In having said that with professional complaints and not a legal procedure so although solicitors and barristers may be involve in representing-- in presenting cases, it is essentially outside the ambit of the law and, of course, one disadvantage may well be that the person bringing the complaint doesn't receive any form of compensation because the outcome of this case was of course that Alice Landau won £6000, a, a modest amount but that's still a substantial compensation. Whereas the, I suppose there's, there is simply the satisfaction of bringing a successful professional complaint against the therapist who may then be sanctioned and in, and in some cases perhaps struck off the register. 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN So are there any other implications that we need to be aware of this? 

00:41:10
PETER JENKINS Yes, ah, two main things. We-- one is in terms of limitations, that there are limitations set down in law regarding time periods for bringing for professional negligence. Now, the-- there is a time limit say of 6 years for bringing action for breach of contract. This case wasn't brought on, on those grounds. There is a time limit of 3 years for bringing professional negligence actions, ah, against the therapist. But with the proviso, this can be extended at the discretion of the court so that although it may appeared to be a fixed window, in fact, it, it can be quite flexible. So the, the, the crucial trigger is the point at which the client became aware that professional negligence had occurred because it may well be that they see the social contact or perhaps even sexual contact with the therapist an entirely justified or necessary or beneficial. It's at the point when they become aware of potential damage that (inaudible ). 

00:42:21
UNKNOWN Right, yes. 

00:42:21
PETER JENKINS Yeah. So that's one implication in terms of time limits. The other very briefly is in terms of liability and I know that there is vogue at the moment for assuming duty of care. Duty of care has entered the therapeutic language. I know this when students start quoting it back to me or managers say, "Ah, we must do this because we have a duty of care." In fact, our duty of care is very limited in law, it's very, very specific and we should be cautious about assuming a duty of care on ethical grounds because in legal terms, if you have a duty of care, you can be sued, you have liability. Now, liability can take different forms so that I think I suspect Dr. Werner in this case was probably working in private practice as a freelance therapist. Now, if you work in private practice as a therapist or a supervisor you carry your own personal liability. So Alice Landau would have been suing Dr. Theodor Werner directly herself. Now, that's something to be aware of and I guess the argument for having adequate professional and damaging insurance becomes overwhelming I think because you need that to pay for your, your illegal representation, legal advice and, and so on. But for many therapists, I think it's the case that we, we don't work in private practice but we work in organizations and the form of liability here if you are employed or if you are a student or a trainee or a volunteer and you're working as if you were employed then the form of liability is called vicarious. So the employer carries the liability for you and that makes a lot of difference. So if you're working in an organization and a client wants to make a legal case and not only bring it against to you but they have to take on the NHS trust or the university or the voluntary organization. So to some extent, you have the resources and the protection of the organization that you work for and of course it's-- if it's a large organization it may well be that their access to, to legal resources is substantial. 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:44:40
PETER JENKINS Say for example university if somebody wanted to sue the university counselor then the university-- I mean, they have access to solicitors, to barristers, they're no stranger to, to court cases and those resources would be available hopefully to, to provide legal advice, legal representation. Having said that, the only proviso is that your interest as a therapist and the interest of your employing organization may not be the same because going to court is extremely expensive and it's not unknown for employers to want to settle out of court. In which case, what they might say is to the agree of client if we were to pay you £500, if we were to give you a laptop, if we were to, uhm, make some kind of financial arrangement, would you drop the case? Of course, we would not be accepting any liability, we would not be accepting that anything untoward had happened to you. 

00:45:45
UNKNOWN But would you just go away... 

00:45:45
PETER JENKINS Would you just go away? And that may be a very positive outcome for the, the organization because they-- there is no legal fall out and there is no court case and-- for a relatively limited outlay you resolve an issue. The difficulty is I think for the practitioner - 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN I don't know. 

00:46:05
PETER JENKINS - what left... 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN Who'd left with the shadow hanging on? 

00:46:10
PETER JENKINS Well, I would, I would wonder how the therapist would feel in that situation because their professional integrity has been challenged and, and employ and might have settled down to court and clearly that's where your own professional indemnity insurance really comes into play and one would really be getting your own solicitors distinct from this list of representing the organization to be part of that negotiation. So it may well be that there's a settlement out of court, there's no la-- acceptance of liability but there's a statement issued and no blame attaches to the counselor involved in this particular situation. So your professional reputation to some extent is protected by that. 

00:46:55
UNKNOWN Explain to me-- just going back very briefly to something you've alluded to. Uhm, it's easy to think of insurance as covering us in the case of damages. 

00:47:10
PETER JENKINS Uh-hmm. 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN So, gosh, I've got to find £50,000 or a £100,000 or whatever it is. 

00:47:10
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN But, ah, she's not just about damages, it's about the legal support that comes before something ever reaches court. 

00:47:20
PETER JENKINS Absolutely. And I, I think it's tempting that we, we pay our annual subscriptions to in-- professional indemnity insurance companies but it is important to check the fine print because if there's any hint of a grievance or difficulty with a client, you are required to inform your company even if it doesn't materialize so at a very early stage you're, you're sending out a warning bell if you like to the company that there is this possibly difficulty. And you also need to keep detailed records of your contact with the client and, and again all of this will be used by the insurance company to, to build a case in your defense. Should you lose a case, then the company wi-- insurance company will pay the compensation. My understanding is that you were found guilty of sexual impropriety with the client that they would not pay. 

00:48:20
UNKNOWN That would be in the fine print there somewhere. 

00:48:20
PETER JENKINS Well, you have to read the, the, the details very, very carefully. Ah, because then it would appear that the insurance company is actually in some way enabling or colluding with unprofessional behavior. So there's an expectation at a certain level of professional behavior anyway. 

00:48:40
PETER JENKINS Absolutely. Yes. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN Reasonably so. 

00:48:40
PETER JENKINS Yes. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN I guess it just begs one more question which has to be in the air. What happened to Dr. Werner? Was he still in practice afterwards? 

00:48:50
PETER JENKINS That's a fascinating bit. I would really like to know more about not just Dr. Theodor Werner, ah, but also Alice Landau and what impact this critical case had on both of them in terms of their careers, their personalities, their relationships and so on. Unfortunately, there is no further material on either of them and it's at that point really that the story ends. 

00:49:20
UNKNOWN A fascinating case, basically. Thank you. 

00:49:20
PETER JENKINS Thank you.
