00:00:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Right. 

00:00:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...I guess, Doug, what I'd like to do is introduce ourselves first... (crosstalk) 

00:00:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Okay. 

00:00:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...and then... (crosstalk) 

00:00:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Okay. 

00:00:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN tell the audience a little bit about how we tell our, the importance on how we tell our grief story.

00:00:45
Lori A. Russell-Chapin, Ph.D. Professor and Counselor Bradley University/Chapin & Russell Associates 

00:00:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN So, I'll start. Uhm, My name is Dr. Lori Russell-Chapin. I work full time at Bradley University and, uhm, Bradley lets me consult, as you know, eight hours a week, and that's when I come back here to Chapin and Russell Associates, where I do private practice work. And, uhm, there are about twelve, twelve other clinicians and then I get to work with my husband, Dr. Ted Chapin. So it's a really nice place to work, Bradley & Chapin Russell Associates. And, uhm, I also thought, Doug, I'd share with the audience how I met you. 

00:01:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Okay. 

00:01:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  So, (crosstalk) 

00:01:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Great. 

00:01:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN uhm, I don't know if you remember this, but you were my student. 

00:01:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yes. 

00:01:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN (laughs) And, uhm, Doug was a, an Episcopalian minister and decided to come back and get a masters in counseling. And you were a wonderful student, Doug. Uhm, I loved having you in class 'coz you were so curious and so much fun to have in class. And so, you were my master's student and you did a thesis, Doug, on Deaf with Dignity. Do you remember that? 

00:01:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Oh, yeah. I remember that. I remember a lot about being in school with you and I enjoyed, ah, all your enthusiasm and, ah... (crosstalk) 

00:01:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh, thank you. (crosstalk) 

00:01:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...your teaching and everything. 

00:01:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, thank you. 

00:01:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH It's wonderful getting to work with you again. (crosstalk) 

00:01:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Isn't that fun again... (crosstalk) 

00:01:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah. 

00:01:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...Doug, after all these years, I think you graduated in 1991? 

00:01:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yes. 

00:01:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, it's wonderful. (crosstalk) 

00:01:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:01:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN So it has a few years of happen. 

00:01:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Right. 

00:01:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, uhm, since then, how about if you introduce yourself? 

00:01:55
Douglas C. Smith, M.Div., M.A., M.S. Trainer And Author 

00:01:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Okay. Ah, Doug Smith, uhm, I now do, uhm, ah, speaking and consulting full time on couple areas, ah, loss and grief and, ah, spiritual care for the sick, the dying and the grieving. Uhm, before that, I was in hospice, ah, 10 years in hospice, ah, eight years in patient care, ah, before being, ah, demoted to administration, ah, where I spent the last two. Ah, and I have really enjoyed, I don't know if that's the right word, but I've, ah, really gotten a lot of meaning and, ah, some good stuff has come from, ah, working with the grieving, the dying. And, ah, so I'm excited about doing this. 

00:02:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN That's wonderful. Well, I know, we'll talk more about some books that we've all written but, uhm, I just think when I was, when you were my student, Doug, and that was the beginning of my journey on this. And, uhm, and I remember being home in Wyoming with my mother and she asked to read your thesis. And it, that started this. I mean, that started, that was the beginning, even though my mother lived like 12 more years, the beginning of our, really letting my mother die with dignity. So I'm, (crosstalk) 

00:03:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:03:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I don't know if I ever thanked you for that, but it was a really, (crosstalk) 

00:03:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH No, I thank, (crosstalk) 

00:03:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  really neat thing... (crosstalk) 

00:03:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH thank you. Thank you. 

00:03:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...that my mom and I could do. So that was the beginning of our journey and here we are today. 

00:03:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Okay. And it's your mom that, ah, was the subject, ah, of your book. 

00:03:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Of my book, yes. (crosstalk) 

00:03:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:03:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  So it's kinda. (crosstalk) 

00:03:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Could you, why don't you tell me... (crosstalk) 

00:03:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay. 

00:03:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...something about your book and what you'd learned... (crosstalk) 

00:03:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, (crosstalk) 

00:03:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...in doing it. 

00:03:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN uhm, the book that I wrote is called "Writing Your Grief Story," and, uhm, it really didn't start out helping other people write their grief story. But it was, ah, yeah, I just, after she died I'd, I, I was stuck. I was in trouble. And, uhm, I was on sabbatical and I just thought I've got to write. And so I just started writing and we'll talk a little bit more about this later, but I would just write everyday and nothing... (crosstalk) 

00:03:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:03:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...grammatically correct, I'd just write. And, and, and the more I wrote, the better I felt. And then I, then I found myself, uhm, it was too intense and so I had to take breaks. And so, uhm, in fact, I stopped writing for about five months, and I kinda tricked myself into believing I was done with that grief stuff, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:04:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:04:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And, uhm, and then, one, another time, I think, the kids and Ted and I were in Greece doing a workshop and I was sitting and watching this beautiful ocean and I just sobbed and I thought I'm not, I'm not even started. And so I started writing again and then the more I wrote, I realized and I let, ah, several people read it. And the more I wrote, I realized that, uhm, you know, people need to know how to do this. So I started researching and kind of got- 

00:04:25
Grief and Loss Beliefs Normalize Grief Reactions. Most life issues are related to loss. Loss is universal. Loss is cumulative. Learn a grief skill set. 

00:04:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN - this book and it's called "Writing Your Grief Story." 

00:04:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. And you're reviewing, in the process, you are not only reviewing your relationship with your mom but also the, the feelings and the thoughts related... (crosstalk) 

00:04:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:04:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH to her not being. (crosstalk) 

00:04:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, I think the feelings and the thoughts, and, and for me, Doug, the thing I'd, one of the biggest things was how crazy the times were. Everything seemed a bit crazy... (crosstalk) 

00:04:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:04:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...I mean, things that would never happen suddenly seemed, they were just abnormal. And so, one of the things I've realized was that that people need to build and normalize their grief reactions. That what we're going through is normal for this very abnormal situation. That I, (crosstalk) 

00:05:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:05:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN that I absolutely found. Do you agree with that? 

00:05:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Oh, yeah. I, I, I agree very much with that that we, we want to, I mean, each of our situations is certainly unique... (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Different. 

00:05:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH but, ah, but we're going through a journey that everybody goes through. (crosstalk) 

00:05:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Gets to go on. 

00:05:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:05:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:05:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uhm, if, if not now, ah, later. (crosstalk) 

00:05:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:05:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And, and, ah, we go through it many times. But also, just processing that, ah, I found that- 

00:05:25
Most life issues are related to loss. 

00:05:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH - almost all counseling's related to loss at some time. (crosstalk) 

00:05:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Me too. I absolutely agree with that. In fact, I think that's the underlying foundation... (crosstalk) 

00:05:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah. 

00:05:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...that we need to help people. 

00:05:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And if we can learn to somehow put names to those feelings, (crosstalk) 

00:05:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:05:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH identify them, look at them, examine them, and... (crosstalk) 

00:05:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:05:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...just them out to, through the writing, you know? 

00:05:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, and so, Doug that's one of the other things I have found, is that, uhm, because we all get to, the loss is truly universal, uhm, I also believe loss is cumulative. If we don't deal with this loss... (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yes, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN we get to, (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:05:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN you know, put a snowball and deal with another loss. Uhm, but I'm, I'm convinced that, that if we get the opportunity to love someone or something, then we'd better understand that we're gonna have to lose that same thing or person. And so I'm convinced that love and loss are different sides of the same coin. 

00:06:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Yes. 

00:06:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And that we're ill-equipped to deal with our losses. 

00:06:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:06:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And most of us just haven't given enough time and effort to it or we have, we don't wanna talk about it 'coz it's not fun... (crosstalk) 

00:06:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:06:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  to talk about. 

00:06:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:06:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And so I think that's the purpose of our DVD, Doug, which is helping people understand how essential it is that we gather a grief skill set. 

00:06:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Yes, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:06:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN That we, (crosstalk) 

00:06:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:06:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN that we have something to draw upon when, when things get really rough. 

00:06:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Right, right. And the more we're attached to somebody, the, (crosstalk) 

00:06:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yes. (crosstalk) 

00:06:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH the greater the grief... (crosstalk) 

00:06:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  The loss is, (crosstalk) 

00:06:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...is gonna be. 

00:06:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN the intensity is gonna be huge. 

00:06:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And, ah, and the bigger the hole is... (crosstalk) 

00:06:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:06:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...when they're gone. Yes, yeah. 

00:06:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, and here's the other thing I found, too, is that, when you talked about the hole, I think that, what I found, and we're not talking, we're about telling our story but, with every word that I wrote, and I usually cried, (clears throat) and it seemed like with every tear that I shed, I could feel the hole getting a little smaller. 

00:07:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:07:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And so to me, I think... (crosstalk) 

00:07:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:07:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...this grief work... (crosstalk) 

00:07:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:07:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...is just essential to our... (crosstalk) 

00:07:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:07:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...well being. 

00:07:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah. And it's kind of, it's also a kind of way, ah, at least a, in reading your book, and in, ah, listening to you, tell... 

00:07:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:07:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH What, what are accomplished there. It's also kind of a way of, ah, almost continuing the life of your mom. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Absolutely. 

00:07:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH she's, ah, and you realize that, ah, even though they're at, that hole has been created, that part of that feeling that back in is realizing that she's still with you... (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh, (crosstalk) 

00:07:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH and you're still. 

00:07:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN absolutely. Well, you taught me this, and you're at our house one night and we're talking about the, the, you gave me this word, Anamnesis. And it's a Greek word... (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Uh hmm. 

00:07:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...and you're gonna have to help fill in the space. (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Okay. 

00:07:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN But as I did some research on it, I found that Anamnesis meant the, bringing the best of the past into our present. And then, when I, when I really began to, to really work with that, I realized that two things had happened. Number one, uhm, that there were things in our past that we may not want to bring into our present and by saying goodbye to them, it, that was healing. 

00:08:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:08:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN But then the things that I loved about my mother, or I loved about my father or my children or my dog, there were some of those things I could bring into my present. 

00:08:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yes. 

00:08:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And so, they really aren't gone. 

00:08:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Right. It's, the, the word actually means, you know, re-experiencing, reliving it... (crosstalk) 

00:08:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:08:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH As if it were now. And so that's the way that, ah, your mom is, ah, with you now. (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. Absolutely. (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And always will be with you. 

00:08:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Yeah. 

00:08:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Because you do have those memories which you can bring back and, (crosstalk) 

00:08:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:08:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH and you're writing has done that. 

00:08:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:08:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN With writing or, or my actions. 

00:08:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:08:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Or another one I did was, uhm, I probably should have worn it today but, I actually have on a piece of my mother's dime, I have a, one of my mother's diamonds on. But I took one of her rings and I made it into, ah, slide and I wear it. And every time I wear it, I think, ooh, I remember when I saw my mother with that. 

00:08:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Hmm. 

00:08:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN You know? 

00:08:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:08:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uhm, the other thing I did is I took some of her sterling flatware and made it into jewelry for my sisters-in-law and my sister. And it's the same thing. It's like, I have these great memories and it's like, she's always with me. 

00:09:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:09:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN You know, and so I think there are so many things, Doug, that we can do to, uhm, help people learn how to have this grief skill set and to help them tell their stories. 

00:09:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:09:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN 'Coz that's the one thing I believe. And I think you said this, too, but everybody has a story to tell. And everybody... (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Oh, yeah. 

00:09:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...has one. 

00:09:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah. 

00:09:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I think it's essential to our well being and growth that we tell our story. 

00:09:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH It's part of our identity... (crosstalk) 

00:09:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN It is. 

00:09:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...and who we are, yeah. 

00:09:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I think when we hide it, or we don't tell it because we're not supposed to talk about grief and loss... 

00:09:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:09:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN That it moves into kind of that shadow part of our life, and, and it hurt, it hurts us. 

00:09:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN It really hurts us. 

00:09:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:09:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN So sounds like we've got, ah, uhm, our work cut out for us today, Doug. 

00:09:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yes, okay, yes, yeah. 

00:09:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Well, let's, let me, let me move on to a question I'd like to ask you. Uhm, I know that you've written several books. Uhm, one of them is called "Being a Wounded Healer," and the other one is called, The Tao of Grieving. And I guess I'm just curious, Doug, uhm, you know, when you wrote that, what, what, what were your goals? What were you trying to achieve? 

00:10:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH I'd, that the more losses that, ah, I let, accumulate in my life. (crosstalk) 

00:10:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:10:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Ah, the more, I, I realized that that it was kind of a, a part of me that I needed to take ownership of and was not something that was being taken away from me. But it was almost a way of, ah, enhancing who I am. 

00:10:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hmm. 

00:10:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  And, one, one of my, ah, favorite quotes, it's a quote by, ah, ah, Pema Chodron, and she says, "Our brilliance, our juiciness, our spiciness is all mixed up with our craziness and our confusion." 

00:10:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh, I love it. 

00:10:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And she says, "And therefore, it's not any good to try to get rid of your so-called, negative aspects. 

00:10:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:10:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Because in that process, you'll also get rid of your basic wonderfulness." 

00:10:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Hmm. 

00:10:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And to me that's what happens in grief work is taking ownership of that stuff, that pain and that suffering... (crosstalk) 

00:11:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:11:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...and knowing that, that is enhancing us. That... (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:11:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...pain and suffering, uhm, ah, doesn't take away from who we are, it adds to who we are. (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:11:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH It doesn't, ah, take away from our, our lives. It adds to our lives. It doesn't even take away from what we can do for others. It can add to what we can do for others. (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Wow. Uh hmm. 

00:11:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uhm, and I think that, that's part of that mystery of growing, ah, through, through grief. 

00:11:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:11:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And so, with the, the first book, ah, Being a Wounded Healer, I, I wanted to process some losses that I had, ah, relative to my dad's death... (crosstalk) 

00:11:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:11:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...my brother's death and my daughter's death and, and then also, ah, losing my ordination and, and so I wanted to somehow put all that stuff together and feel, what can I learn from it? What can I learn from it? And, uhm, and that was the reason behind that book. And then, I thought I had solved everything because. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I'm done, I'm done with this grief scenario. (crosstalk) 

00:12:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah. But then along came the death of my second child, Emarin(ph) and I thought, you know, I've, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN We're just getting started. (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH we've, we've always got these losses. 

00:12:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:12:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And they're gonna always be with us... (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:12:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...and so, I wanted to write The Tao(ph) of Grieving. Ah, not only as a survivor manual for myself but also, uhm, to offer it to others. 

00:12:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Yeah. 

00:12:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH As a possibility of how do we equip ourselves. 

00:12:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:12:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH How do we grow... (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...through this stuff? And, ho, also, how do we prepare ourselves for our eventual losses. 

00:12:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN You know, and, and Doug, I really agree with that, that, that every loss we have, helps us prepare for the bigger losses. 

00:12:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:12:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And, and as you said, by the biggest loss for each of us, is our own death. But we don't really like to talk about that. 

00:12:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH No, no. 

00:12:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I think the more we can understand this and the more dignity there is to it that the people aren't quite as afraid of it. 

00:12:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:12:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN So, I absolutely agree with that piece. (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. It doesn't even have to be, ah, a death, ah, a divorce, a job loss. 

00:13:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:13:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uhm, uhm, a haircut, 'coz it's, it's a loss experience. (laughs) 

00:13:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Absolutely. On losing my gloves, I mean, (crosstalk) 

00:13:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah. 

00:13:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN we, we, we've, I think this is a part of our existence, okay? (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Right. 

00:13:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I, I don't think it matters if the loss is anticipated or if it's a, if it's an unexpected or if it's a tragedy. 

00:13:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:13:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And it's sudden. It, the, they all have their own uniqueness to it. 

00:13:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yes. 

00:13:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN But as, you're right, it's absolutely a loss. 

00:13:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And, but then, there's so many messages, ah, in the, the world that, you know, "Avoid pain and suffering, run from it, (crosstalk) 

00:13:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:13:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH hide from it. Take a pill and get over it." 

00:13:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:13:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And, uhm, even those of us in the helping professions were told, you know, to never show our vulnerability. 

00:13:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:13:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH You know, maintain a clinical distance. 

00:13:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:13:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And yet, uhm, we, we learn, ah, ah, all of us, everybody learns, just in living life... (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:13:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH that our, our moments of greatest growth... (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:13:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...are inseparably linked with those moments of greatest pain and suffering. 

00:13:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Absolutely. 

00:13:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And over and over again, we learn. Wisdom evolves from conflict. 

00:13:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Ah, maturity is born in crisis. 

00:14:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hmm. 

00:14:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And we, we know all of that stuff, but everybody is telling us, "Avoid it." 

00:14:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:14:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH But telling the story or writing the story... (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:14:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  ah, lets us take ownership... 

00:14:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Absolutely. 

00:14:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH To that, puts words to it. 

00:14:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Absolutely. 

00:14:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Ah, gives language to our feelings and enhances... (crosstalk) 

00:14:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:14:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...who we are. Yeah. 

00:14:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, and we'll talk more about this, Doug, but you know, I think one of the biggest things I learned is the Importance of somehow making meaning of the loss that we have. 

00:14:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:14:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And we'll talk more about that. But to me, that's the, the pinnacle, that's the goal. That if we could make meaning, then what I can do is I can help myself understand it and maybe, I can help someone else understand it. 

00:14:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yes, okay. 

00:14:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I, I find that to be, and there are lots of ways we can do that, but I, but I find that to be really important as well. 

00:14:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH We're, we're talking about some of these thing that, ah, you know, that we both believe in. 

00:14:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:14:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Did you find yourself, ah, getting any surprises when you are... (crosstalk) 

00:14:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh. 

00:14:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...writing your story? 

00:14:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Yeah, you know, and that was interesting. This process is not linear. And I had tons of surprises. And they would like hit me in the back of my head 'til I go, "Whoa, that's pretty interesting." Uhm, I think one of the biggest surprises- 

00:15:05
Surprises of Grief Grief can be seductive. Grief needs to be taken in small segments. Every person grieves differently. 

00:15:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN - I got was that, uhm, I can't take the grief in long periods. That was, they were. It was too much. And so, I kinda called them, grief bursts, where you could just have a little bit of it. And, but then I could honestly, and I, you used this word once today, but, enjoy it, ah, well, there're moments where I'd say it's too much and that's why I'd stop and try do something else. 

00:15:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:15:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN But, uhm, and then, on the, kind of the paradox of that is, I found though, that my grief was also seductive. This was a huge surprise. That I was almost afraid to even not think about my losses or my mother. 

00:15:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Oh. Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Because it was so comfortable and the more I would get comfortable in my grief, the closer I felt to my mother so I didn't wanna leave it. 

00:15:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Okay. 

00:15:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And so it was almost seductive. And one day, and I wrote about this in the book, one day Jameson, he was 10 at that time, he came home and it was, it was around his birthday and I was supposed to make cupcakes for everybody, for his birthday party. And, I told him I'd make it after school. He got home and the cupcakes weren't done and he said, "Mom, what have you been doing?" And, and I had been sitting in a bay window. I was on sabbatical from Bradley. I'm sitting on a bay window and the sun's just streaming down and it was just so much and I'm reading a book and then I'd cry and then I'd read the book, and I just, ah, four hours passed. And I didn't get the cupcakes done. 

00:16:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Okay. 

00:16:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And Jameson turned to me and he said, "Mom," and, this is, this is, you know, out of the mouth of a baby, he said, "Mom, I'm alive. Grandma Helen is dead. She wants you to be with me." 

00:16:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Oh. 

00:16:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I went, "Oh." (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Okay. All right. 

00:16:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN You know, it snapped me out of the seductive place. 

00:16:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:16:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I thought, he is right so I knew that you have to take these grief moments when you can't come, can, can, but you cannot, uhm, get to, kind of engulfed in them. (crosstalk) 

00:16:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Okay. 

00:16:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN When they seduce you. 

00:16:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH She's still a part of your life, but she's not your total life and you can't be always... 

00:16:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yes. 

00:16:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...with her. 

00:16:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Exactly. (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. Okay. 

00:16:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And so I knew she could, and she's not in my present all the time either, you know? (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Yeah. 

00:17:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN So I learned that piece. Uhm, I also think I learned the piece of, uhm, how important it is that we allow people to grieve differently, you know? I would sometimes wanna tell people something, and, and my family would get tired of it. 

00:17:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Oh. 

00:17:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And my mom did this, you know? And they get tired of it. 

00:17:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN So I will, that was a surprise too. 

00:17:15
By telling our grief story, our loved ones become present. 

00:17:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN That everybody kinda does this thing differently. 

00:17:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Yes, okay, yeah. 

00:17:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN So I think that was a little bit of a surprise. 

00:17:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah. 

00:17:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Any, ah, any surprises that you learned along the way? 

00:17:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH I find that the more I'm in touch with that grief, uhm, the, the more I can grow as a person. And, ah, and, ah, and that, that was always surprising because initially, ah, I felt, that, ah, with the death of my child, that something was being taken away from me. 

00:17:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:17:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uhm, and, ah, I wasn't ready to learn that, uhm, she is still here with me. 

00:17:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:17:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And every time I tell her story, she's present. (crosstalk) 

00:17:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:17:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Her life is continuing... (crosstalk) 

00:17:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:17:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  when I tell the story. And, and that was a surprise to me, because I thought, it was, you know, ah, gone, completely gone. 

00:18:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:18:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH But no, no. 

00:18:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:18:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Ah, and that, and then also, what I was surprised about and you kind of touched on this too, is that even though, we've all had these unique journeys that, there's something about people- 

00:18:20
Everyone has experienced loss. Telling our stories and opening up helps us to connect with others. 

00:18:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH - really can connect with you, when you open up and you talk about... (crosstalk) 

00:18:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:18:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...your own pain. 

00:18:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Uh hmm. 

00:18:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Because everybody's had it. 

00:18:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:18:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And they, uhm, ah, it's, it's as if that, it's easy to trust someone, it's easy to be with someone... (crosstalk) 

00:18:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Uh hmm. 

00:18:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...who's just like us. 

00:18:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:18:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And, and who we are, are people who have had pain and suffering. 

00:18:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:18:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And, and shortcomings and vulnerability and. 

00:18:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, so we can really connect on that level. (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yes, yeah. 

00:18:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well(ph), absolutely. (crosstalk) 

00:18:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah. 

00:18:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And maybe by connecting in that level, it's easier to trust people because, you know, that they're being genuine. 

00:18:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah, right. 

00:18:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN You know, I think another surprise I had was, you mentioned that, uhm, when you, were working with grief, that you,- 

00:19:00
Distractors from Grief Excessiveness/Overdoing Bodily Complaints 

00:19:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN - you became kind of very aware of what was going on around you. But I also found that when I wasn't working on my grief, because it was too painful, that I would overdo anything to stay away from my grief so... (crosstalk) 

00:19:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Well, yes. 

00:19:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...I found myself, uhm, like exercising too much. 

00:19:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Okay. 

00:19:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Or spending too much money or and I was in a doing a grief workshop, ah, probably a month ago, and I asked people in the room, "What did you do over something?" And someone said, "I drank too much, I did drugs too much." Uhm, anything in excess just to get away from it. 

00:19:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:19:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And then I would find that, when I would do that, uhm, and I really wasn't actively working on my grief, what would happen is, I would have incredible dreams. Oh, Doug, my dreams and I share a lot of my dreams in the book. But my dream were powerful and it was just like they were bringing me back, let's deal with these issues. 

00:19:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:19:50
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And then the other thing that was a surprise to me was, when I wasn't working on my grief, is my body began to talk. You know, I'd say, "I'm fine," And you pretend it's not Lori, "How are you?" "I'm fine, you know, I'm done." And then my body would have certain aches or pains that if I listen to 'em, it would take me back to my grief, too. 

00:20:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:20:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Which I thought was really... (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:20:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...amazing and, and wonderful that there's that connection for me and my body's spirit. 

00:20:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:20:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN You, you can run as hard as you can... (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:20:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...but it's, it's gonna... (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:20:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...come get you. 

00:20:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. For me how I plug in to what you're just saying is that uhm, my ah, substitute addiction was that I, I ended up buying a lot of books and reading a lot and that, (crosstalk) 

00:20:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh yeah. 

00:20:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH that took me away. 

00:20:25
We often listen to other's stories instead of telling or writing our own. 

00:20:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH But then I, I would gradually find myself not hearing what I was reading and uhm, not realizing that I needed really, I was listening to other people's stories and avoiding my own. 

00:20:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I know, it's not easy. (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And that, that's what I had to do, I had to write my own, I have to... (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah isn't it? (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Tell my own. 

00:20:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:20:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:20:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Why it, it reminds me of that there's some great cliches of books out. But you know, searching for the guru, guru, I would, I read so much material in grief and loss and I was sure that someone had the answer to my question. 

00:20:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Right, yes. 

00:20:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And then I finally realized, no. I, I'm the only one... (crosstalk) 

00:21:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:21:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...that has the answer... (crosstalk) 

00:21:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:21:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...to my question. 

00:21:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:21:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN So I think it's that same piece, which is really important. 

00:21:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH That reminds me of one of the things that I felt in doing ah, being a wounded healer was that in writing my story, there, there are two parts of myself that I needed to get in touch with. 

00:21:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:21:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH One was the patient. One was the person that had the pain, (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:21:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH the suffering, (crosstalk) 

00:21:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:21:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH the anxiety, and the fear. But the other aspect to myself, and this is what I think is important in encouraging others... (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Uh hmm. 

00:21:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...to write their story is that we not only wanna be honest with the feelings that are inside but we also can discover that inside we've also got our counselor, our own healer, (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN  Yeah. It's... (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH our own doctor, (crosstalk) 

00:21:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...very nice. 

00:21:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH therapist, nurse and uhm, what I found is that whenever- 

00:21:45
When we admit to ourselves that we are wounded, the inner counselor appears. 

00:21:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH - I'm really honest about being the patient, honest about having the pain and the suffering. That the counselor almost spontaneously and serendipitously appears... (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Wow. Hhmm. 

00:21:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...and starts doing that the healing because I've admitted what the wounds are. 

00:22:00
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Wow. So it's that we the, kind of telling the audience that we all have our own inner advisor that can, (crosstalk) 

00:22:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:22:05
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN is there and has wisdom if we'll just listen to it. 

00:22:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yes. 

00:22:10
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh, that's very nice, Doug. (crosstalk) 

00:22:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah and what, yeah, yeah. When we're honest with ourselves, and what's going inside, we'll discover the pain but we'll also discover how to be engaged. (crosstalk) 

00:22:15
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Saw(ph) the solutions? 

00:22:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, so that, that, (crosstalk) 

00:22:20
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah, that's really lovely. 

00:22:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH that, that pain, yeah. Well for you, you know, we're, we're kind of beginning to get into that. For you, what's, was meaningful about doing grief, (crosstalk) 

00:22:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:22:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH grief work? Uhm. 

00:22:30
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN I, I guess I'd have to go back to the, the term you taught me, Doug. The, the an, Anamnesis piece, which is, I, I think if I can find meaning in this somehow uhm, that it, it is just become so powerful for me. And, and so- 

00:22:45
Finding Personal Meaning in Loss Discover ways to honor your loved ones. 

00:22:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN - if I, and, and there's so many ways that I can find meaning. For example I, I decided, I hadn't done a grief group and I'm ver, years. And I decided that was something I could do to honor my mother. So I went back and I uhm, went to ah, organization in town and I'm, ask if they needed some help for the grief work. And of course, people, but you don't usually get people to say, "Can I help you with grief work?" You know, "Oh, we'd love that." And what I found fascinating is I proposed a six-week closed grief group and it would be for anybody who's lost someone in the last six months. And I got these people on this group and after we'd screened them, and they were in such intense pain, Doug. And that within an hour-and-a-half, just by ours(ph), acknowledging and saying, "It's okay, however you feel is okay." Uhm, saying that, "We're gonna give you some skills to deal with this." There was instantaneous relief. 

00:23:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Uhm, uh hmmm. 

00:23:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN Now, the pain didn't stop. (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Right, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN But they said, "Oh, you mean, there are really ways to get through that?" 

00:23:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN And so, it was so meaningful to me that by doing this, I'm honoring my mother. 

00:23:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yes, yes. 

00:23:45
LORI A. RUSSELL-CHAPIN But, but also, then I'm also teaching people these skills that we can cope with life. And it was like,"Wow!" that, that is, it was healing. 

00:23:55

00:24:20

With, to save the Girl Scout house or she was gonna save something and so I always know that when I'm doing something to make a difference. You know, (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmmm. 

00:24:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN To help somebody else that again, I'm honoring, that's the meaning. I think that's the meaning the I get from grief work. (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Okay. 

00:24:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And what's meaningful about the grief work for you? 

00:24:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uhm, I, I, for me, the, it, it's so easy ah, for me, and I think for anyone in this world to uhm, meet images that people have of you to ah, we, we're so programmed in uhm, wanting to be on top of things, (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:25:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH wanting to... (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Be in control? (laughs) 

00:25:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...be, be in control, be ah, youthful, not acknowledge that we've got imperfections or vulnerabilities and yet whenever I meet somebody that's like that I, I say to it, you know, I don't wanna be like that, I wanna, I wanna be real. 

00:25:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:25:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And uhm, to me grief work is getting in touch with what's real. (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:25:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH It anything that were given we're gonna lose. 

00:25:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmmm. 

00:25:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Ah, and ah, and all of these relationships not only ah, when we fall in love with someone ah, ah, that's gonna have to end through death or somehow... (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Yeah. 

00:25:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Ah, ah, but it's just a part of life and for us to live life or pretend as though we're not gonna age and nobody's... (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...gonna die and everybody's gonna always be with us... (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hhmm. 

00:26:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...and we're gonna always have our job, always have ah, (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Health. 

00:26:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Health and everything and ah, it just doesn't help. And ah, I think the more I'm in touch with my losses, the more I'm in touch with who I am and the, the more ah, ready I am for the future, the more mature I am and the more and people like that realness. (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:26:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH I like it, and I think people will like it, in me if I should get in touch with that. 

00:26:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:26:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:26:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And do you think, Doug the, if we had that philosophy though we'd be more in the moment? I mean if we really knew that everything we love, we're gonna lose and I, I love this here, it says, you know, this life is not a dresser... (crosstalk) 

00:26:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Ah, yes, yeah. 

00:26:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN The souls, that would we, would we treat people differently? Would we be more respectful? Would we be more intentional? I. (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH I, I think so. 

00:26:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:26:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH That because (laughs). 

00:26:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I absolutely think so... (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah. 

00:26:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN but I think we get so caught up in life... (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Right, right, right. 

00:26:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...and so busy I for, I forget, I get, I get, I used that word again seduced in other things. (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:26:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I just forget. (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Right. Right. 

00:26:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN You know, what's., (crosstalk) 

00:26:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:26:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN What's the purpose of life, I think. And I think, as I listen to talk, the other thing I find meaningful about grief work though, is that, I was talking about the grief group I had and the, the big question I get consistently whether it's individual or group counseling is, "I just want this to be over so I, as soon I get this grief stuff over my life will go back to normal, right?" 

00:27:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah. 

00:27:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I, and I have to look at them and, you know, say, "No, you're not, you're life's never gonna go back to normal." 

00:27:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Right, yeah. 

00:27:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And so it's meaningful for me- 

00:27:25
Our lives will never go back to normal. Create a new normal. Reintegrate the best of the past and the best of the now. 

00:27:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN To help people. And there's two terms I really like. And one of the terms I got from a man named Alan Wolfelt and the other one is Don Piper. But the terms I really liked are uhm, know what we have to do is reintegrate our new life or have a new normal. And to teach people that our new normal, it, it won't be the same as our old normal. 

00:27:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:27:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uhm, I'm not even gonna say it's better but it's gonna be different. And if we can have a different new ah, new normal and we can reintegrate some of those lovely things from the past to bring into our present, we can have an extraordinary life. 

00:28:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH, M. DIV., M.A., M.S. Yeah, yeah. 

00:28:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And that has been really meaningful. (crosstalk) 

00:28:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH, M. DIV., M.A., M.S.  Uh hmm. 

00:28:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN You know, it's we're, we're creating a different identity almost. 

00:28:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH, M. DIV., M.A., M.S. Yes. 

00:28:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And we haven't lost. I loved what you said. We really haven't lost those things but we're bringing it back... (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:28:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...into this present. 

00:28:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And, and I wanna, I guess I wanna really underlying that fact that it's a more, it's a more real identity. I, I uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I agree, Doug. 

00:28:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH My ah, first ah, date with ah, Mary my wife... (crosstalk) 

00:28:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmmm. 

00:28:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...we uhm, ah, went out to... (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Say hi, say hi to Mary. (laughs) 

00:28:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Okay. (laughs) We went out to dinner and I've got familial tremor. And ah, I wanted to be very careful on what I ate there. I didn't wanna have her see my... (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Sure. 

00:28:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...imperfections. And uhm, so I, I ordered ah, a shish kebab ah, thinking that you know, everything's cut up ahead of time... (crosstalk) 

00:28:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Oh(ph) sure. 

00:28:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH So I won't have to worry ar, about, the fork and the knife, it set(ph), but it came out on a skewer and in my haste to remove the skewer this piece of meat shot across... (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh no. 

00:29:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...the table and landed in her lap. And, and I, I knew I'd ruined any future possibility with her so I, I talked about the fact that I'd been a patient in a mental hospital. I thought, yeah, (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Maybe that one thing, that it'd helped Doug. (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Well, well, what happened, what happened was that all of a sudden that dating game... (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...which I think is very... (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Yeah. 

00:29:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...uhm, symptomatic of the many games that we play... (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:29:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...that we try to impress people with being actually- 

00:29:25
Build our lives on reality Authentic Trustworthy Congruent Empathic 

00:29:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH - more than who we are. 

00:29:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Yeah. 

00:29:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH, M. DIV., M.A., M.S. And when we do get in touch with who we are ah, that we can build things on reality. We cannot build anything on a false front, (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:29:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...nothing. No matter what that reality is (laughs). (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Sure, absolutely. 

00:29:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Even if you're going out on a date with somebody that has meat go across the table... (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Yeah. Shooting across the table, yeah. 

00:29:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...it came from a mental hospital. Uhm, but yeah, I, to me that's part of the meaningfulness of grief work is becoming more real... (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:29:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...or authentic, more trustworthy, (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:29:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...ah, more congruent, (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:30:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...ah, and then you also can be more ah, empathic. 

00:30:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Absol, with other people and yourself? (crosstalk) 

00:30:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH With other people, yes. 

00:30:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH You reminded, Doug, though of another part. This is, might be the surprise part but uhm, as I got more vulnerable and I was, I guess that's the piece I haven't used. I think this journey that we're taking is very courageous. Uhm, it's a little bit scary, but you usually are able to connect with other people who are in the same place. But then I would share this story with other people and then I realized that I scared them. 

00:30:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Okay. 

00:30:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And by, but, what I mean by that is that they weren't ready, Doug. They were not ready... (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:30:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...to be that vulnerable. And so the only way they could deal with it is to be defensive. 

00:30:40
Not everybody is on the same part of the grief journey. 

00:30:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. And so I think when people are on a grief journey we have to recognize that not everybody is in the same place that we're on. (crosstalk) 

00:30:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH, M. DIV., M.A., M.S. Right, right. 

00:30:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Does that make any sense? 

00:30:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH It does make sense. And it, it ties in with what you're saying before that we, we do this a little at a time... (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. There's a dance kinda... (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...in waves. 

00:30:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...there's a, yeah, there's a... (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah. 

00:30:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...they're waves absolutely. 

00:30:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH We need to take rest. Ah. 

00:31:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. And take care of our self as we're doing it. (crosstalk) 

00:31:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yes, yeah, yeah. 

00:31:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And, and when people don't treat you with uhm, may be the empathy that you want, we can't be afraid of that either... (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:31:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN  we have to understand... (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah. 

00:31:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN That they're in a different place and it's not... (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:31:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN It's, it's not to be judged. 

00:31:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Hhmm. 

00:31:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN But they're not ready to take the grief plunge... (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Right, right. 

00:31:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...that's the term I use. (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Right. 

00:31:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uhm, and so I think we have to be aware that not everybody is in the same plane. 

00:31:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH That, that might lead into something else that I wanted to talk about... (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...and that is that, you know, how people can tell their stories... (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:31:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...that I, I think they are dependent upon the, the type of loss and the type of person. Ah, one way in telling the loss is the way you have done it, which is... (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...which is be, being very honest, direct, this is what the relationship was and this is who my mom was... (crosstalk) 

00:31:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:31:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...this is what I really gained from her and this is how I'm processing that loss. 

00:31:45
Methods of Storytelling Be aware of the person in pain and the internal counselor. 

00:31:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH, M. DIV., M.A., M.S. Uhm, and that's one way that I think... (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:31:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...people can do it. Ah, and if people are doing or telling their story or writing their story ah, I do think it's important that we always keep in mind those two aspects that I talked about. The, the one, the person in pain (laugh) (crosstalk) 

00:32:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:32:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Ah, and always be aware of that but also the, that internal ah, counselor... (crosstalk) 

00:32:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:32:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...that they have as well. And then make sure that I'm always in touch with both of those. And then I'm not ah, losing myself... (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...but I'm gaining my total self. But for those people that you know, that, that might be, with many people too painful... (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:32:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...to do... (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah, too scary. 

00:32:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...uhm, I found that people can sometimes ah, tell the story allegorically or metaphorically and, and I've been working with this one technique called the "virtual dream" and depending upon what the subject is, now with grief, I had people do a short story and I have six elements in the story. (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Hhmm. 

00:32:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And the, the, the six elements that I have is your- 

00:32:50
300 Word Short Story 

00:32:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH The person that's died, (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Okay. 

00:32:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH, M. DIV., M.A., M.S. Ah, I have an empty room... (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Hhmm. 

00:32:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH, M. DIV., M.A., M.S. ...it's gotta be in the short story, a child. (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Oh that's lovely. 

00:32:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH A mysterious person, a wolf and a holy place. (crosstalk) 

00:33:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Ah, that's great. 

00:33:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And I have them as quickly as possible write at 300, approximate 300-word story. (crosstalk) 

00:33:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Hhmm. 

00:33:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And then, whatever we do with dreams we can do with the short story because most theorist say that dreams are an aspect of yourself... (crosstalk) 

00:33:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...every element of the dream... (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah, uh hmm. 

00:33:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...is part of you. 

00:33:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh, Carl Jung would love you (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:33:22
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah. But every story ah, that you create... (crosstalk) 

00:33:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:33:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...is part of you as well. And so I have people identify with each of those elements. With... (crosstalk) 

00:33:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Hhmm. 

00:33:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...the child, how did you feel as the child in your story? 

00:33:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Hhmm. 

00:33:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  How did you feel as your lost... (crosstalk) 

00:33:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Wow. 

00:33:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...loved one? 

00:33:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And this ah, how did you feel as that holy place... (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. The wol, yeah, or the wolf. 

00:33:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...and, and the wolf. 

00:33:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Oh, that's wonderful. 

00:33:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And so that, that's the way of people that maybe telling a story too directly might be too painful but here's a way of... (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Hhmm. 

00:33:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH kinda easing into... (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:33:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...the various parts of that. And a third way that people can do the story, which is what I did with the, the dower(ph) of grieving was that ah, I did it through paraphrase. 

00:34:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Ah, one of my favorite books is the Dao De Jing... (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...and so I thought, you know I'm gonna kinda rewrite that with my words and my feelings and relate it to grief. And so somebody could take uhm, the Book of Psalms... (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...or the Book of Proverbs or the Saints of Jesus... (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH or Buddha, or Muhammad... (crosstalk) 

00:34:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...or even going to a, a quotation dictionary and look under grief or healing... (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...or love, and just reword it in your own... (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh, that sounds wonderful. 

00:34:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...way, with your own feelings. 

00:34:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And so what you're doing is taking your own world view and trying to put some of that in this context? 

00:34:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yes. Yeah. And so... (crosstalk) 

00:34:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah, that's well done(ph), Doug. 

00:34:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...uhm, did, different ways of somehow getting ah, in contact... (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:34:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH with ah, at stuff(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And some of those feelings. 

00:34:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:34:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, I don't know, if you found this to be true. But I, I still find it, whenever I have a giant loss and I'm not quite ready to deal with it, what I find is that I go to a movie or I'll read a book. And it seemed like right around the time my mother passed away, she died, every movie that Ted took me to, and it wasn't purposeful had a, had a funeral in it. 

00:35:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Oh, yes. 

00:35:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Or someone was dying in it. 

00:35:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Okay. 

00:35:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And you know, and I think it's happening around us all the time but that when it happens to you, it suddenly like you've got blinders on somehow and that's all that you see. And I, I have found myself, that what I would do then is, it was so hard to watch. But I would go home and just write about the movie. 

00:35:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH, M. DIV., M.A., M.S. Oh, yeah. 

00:35:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So I mean it's the same kind of take(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:35:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH, M. DIV., M.A., M.S. Yes, yes. Uh-huh. 

00:35:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...that you're saying. Or uhm, I'd read a book and I'd say, "That's character, identify with that character." And I'd start writing about the character. And I think that's the thing I would say, Doug, when we're telling our story or if you choose to write it. That uhm, couple of things I would tell uhm, our audiences that I can't do this wrong. Uhm, I kinda wish that we could give them ah, ah, a script exactly how to do it. But you, there isn't one. (crosstalk)

00:35:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH, M. DIV., M.A., M.S. Yes. 

00:35:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And so, you know, write, not for grammar. Uhm, you don't have to write in full sentences. You can doodle, you could paint, uhm, you could take a picture that you've found in an old album and just, as you said, write, write to the picture. 

00:36:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:36:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And you can't do this wrong. 

00:36:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Right. 

00:36:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And then you just keep writing and there'd be days, one of the things I do is I sit up when I, before I stopped would, I'm gonna write everyday, even if it's two minutes. What I found was, if I just start writing, not, not like we were taught in school to have an outline and all. Now, if I just start writing, things would just come out. I could... (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Hhmm. 

00:36:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...I would... (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Hhmm. 

00:36:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...write... (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Hhmm. 

00:36:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...for hours. 

00:36:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Hhmm. 

00:36:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I, I can't tell you they... (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:36:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...made much sense. But you know, they would, they, they would come out and then what I found is that eventually I was able to give it to people that I trusted and, and then I started writing for grammar if I wanted to, you know. So, I mean, I think there are things, Doug, that we can do... (crosstalk) 

00:36:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:36:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...to uhm, tell our story. 

00:36:40

LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, so here's my question to you. I-, if there's anybody in our audience that might, they're telling their story, they might, they're writing their story and they would like to ha, maybe get some of their work published, what would you recommend that they do?

00:39:00
Normalize the grief reaction. 

00:39:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH - uhm, you, you had mentioned earlier this normalization. (crosstalk) 

00:39:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:39:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH I think that uhm, hearing other people's stories and realizing that we're not ah, the journey is not one that you have to take alone. There are some things... (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Oh, yeah. 

00:39:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...that you will need to do alone but other people have not had the same loss- 

00:39:20
Let others help. 

00:39:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH - but have had losses... (crosstalk) 

00:39:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:39:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...similar losses have gone to those feelings and it helps to hear other people's stories to let me know I'm, I'm not crazy. (crosstalk) 

00:39:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. Oh, it's comforting(ph). 

00:39:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH I'm not crazy if I wanna talk ah, to the deceased in some way. (crosstalk) 

00:39:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Do you do that? 

00:39:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH I do that. (crosstalk) 

00:39:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I do, I do that at daily basis. 

00:39:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH I do that with different ways and I, I encourage whenever I do training I encourage counselors to tell... (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...clients it's legal, it's legal. (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN It's, it's legal too. That's too good. (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Ah, and I do it, different ways. With my dad, I do it through dreams. 

00:39:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Yeah. 

00:39:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Before my dad died he was in uhm, one in 10 dreams. He's in one of three dreams now. 

00:39:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Seriously, that's so cool. (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. With my daughter Kristin, my first child, I just tell her a story. And that's... (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Hmm. 

00:40:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...I feel her presence... (crosstalk) 

00:40:05

LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:40:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...and that, uhm, my brother Dean, we were both bicyclists. When I get, when I'm there, I'm riding my bicycle, I'm with Deane. (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:40:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And, and I think people, you know, some people it might be sitting in a chair... (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Yeah. 

00:40:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...it might be going to a restaurant that you used to go to. 

00:40:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:40:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Or, or it might be setting a table setting. 

00:40:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Yeah. 

00:40:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Keeping some of the clothes. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. Ah, I think we've, "cultural labels" we have said things are unhealthy, which... (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. "Oh, That's weird," yeah. 

00:40:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...they're not. I mean there's other cultures that have got altars to the deceased. (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:40:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH What's wrong with talking to somebody... (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN The day of the dead. How about the day of the dead? 

00:40:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH (laughs) Yeah. 

00:40:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN You know. 

00:40:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. Yeah, and so... (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN We know. 

00:40:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...yeah, people just need to find their way what, which is the way, yeah, maybe you don't dream. But that doesn't mean you don't have another way. (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Yeah. Oh, I think there's so... (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:40:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Many ways to tell... (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:40:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. ...the story. 

00:40:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:40:55
Honor loved ones in a personal way. 

00:40:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uhm, when you were talking I, I also thought about how, ah, and during our holidays, I mean I, I have to think my, I have so much of my mother's things but I'd love to bring them out. I mean it, once again, I think that's the way that we... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...we honor our, our... (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:41:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...people that we have lost and loved. (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. That reminds me about a holiday thing I encourage people to do which is kind of this continuance. Uhm, I have people, that first Christmas after the death, I have them- 

00:41:20
Develop gratitude boxes. 

00:41:20
DOUGLAS C. SMITH - think about each of the family members. Think about what you're most thankful for having received from this... (crosstalk) 

00:41:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:41:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  person. Write it on a piece of paper, put it in a box, wrap the box and put that present... (crosstalk) 

00:41:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:41:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...along with all others... (crosstalk) 

00:41:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:41:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...under the tree. And then the first present that everybody opens up and shares with the rest of the family is what they're most thankful... (crosstalk) 

00:41:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. 

00:41:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...for having received. Then it's a way of showing that this... (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN No. He's still there. 

00:41:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...person is still with us, still giving to us. 

00:41:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, and Doug, ah, of all the presents you get under the tree which of, which would be the most meaningful... (crosstalk) 

00:41:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Right. 

00:41:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...that one. When... (crosstalk) 

00:41:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah. 

00:41:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...and then we all say, "Well, we could take the rest of these to some... (crosstalk) 

00:41:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yes, okay, yes. (laughs) 

00:41:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...place else." 

00:41:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I mean... (crosstalk) 

00:41:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Okay, yeah. 

00:41:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...that's amazing to me. 

00:41:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Yeah. 

00:42:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well I, I think you know the piece that I would say to people in the midst to grief is that- 

00:42:00
Take the grief plunge Tell your story and begin to heal. It's okay to feel moments of happiness. 

00:42:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. The big thing is take the grief plunge. I think we are so afraid of it. But if we, we're willing to, I loved what you said. "We don't have to do this by yourself." And so, and I, I think that's the purpose of our video even. 

00:42:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH, M. DIV., M.A., M.S. Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So take the grief plunge, tell your story. Ah, ah, you know, I'm fascinated, anytime, that's the biggest thing, talk about meaning to, I sit in grief group where I listen to people talk and I'm fascinated. (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:42:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Their story... (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah. 

00:42:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Is fascinating. (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:42:25
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I understand that when they tell their story then they're actually healing too. So I love that piece... (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yes. 

00:42:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...that's my one... (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Okay. 

00:42:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...way of encouragement. I think the other word of encouragement is that, I've had several people ask me this question, "It, is it okay for me to be happy now that I've lost... (crosstalk) 

00:42:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:42:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...someone that I really... (crosstalk) 

00:42:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:42:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...loved?" 

00:42:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:42:45
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And what I believe is our loved ones want us to be... (crosstalk) 

00:42:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yes, yeah. 

00:42:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...happy. They want us to be living in the present. And that if we really believe that then we can do that, and it's... (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Uh hmm. 

00:42:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...okay. But most, many of my clients actually feel guilty that the minute they begin to feel happy they start to feel guilty. It's like "Oh! If I... (crosstalk) 

00:43:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Right. 

00:43:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...if I'm happy then I didn't love... (crosstalk) 

00:43:05
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, yeah. 

00:43:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...this person." And I, I think that's that reframe(ph) again of, if you have a moment of happiness grab on to it... (crosstalk) 

00:43:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Yes. Well that would... (crosstalk) 

00:43:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...enjoy it. 

00:43:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...what would they want? Yeah, yeah, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:43:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And they would want you to do that. (crosstalk) 

00:43:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. 

00:43:15
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN So, and you know, I think that's it, uhm, take the grief plunge, uhm, it's okay, it's scary. But if, if we are willing to do that we'll be healthier. 

00:43:25
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah. You were sharing with me, ah, a quotation earlier today that... (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Yeah. 

00:43:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH We, we said we both had similar... (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay. 

00:43:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  quotations. Maybe we can... (crosstalk) 

00:43:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Well, we share each of our quotations, okay. (crosstalk) 

00:43:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Yeah, maybe we could, who, who should go first? Do I. (crosstalk) 

00:43:35
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I don't care, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:43:35
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Okay. 

00:43:40
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN I'll go first... (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Okay. All right. 

00:43:42
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...and you can end it, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:43:42
DOUGLAS C. SMITH And then we'll kinda use this as sort of a wrap up... (crosstalk) 

00:43:42
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Okay. 

00:43:42
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...to the, okay. 

00:43:42
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN That sounds good. Ah, one of my favorite poets is a, is a Sufi poet named Rumi, and I think this quote can mean anything anybody wants it to be. But, uhm, he says, "there are messages in the early morning breeze, do not fall back to sleep." 

00:43:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Uhm. 

00:44:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN And I, I think that's what I'm talking about with grief work, you know, we're so afraid, Doug, of it and that if they've, if it- 

00:44:05
There are wonderful messages in our pain. 

00:44:05
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. - if the audience couldn't clean anything from our talk today, you don't have to fall back asleep. There are wonderful messages in our... (crosstalk) 

00:44:10
DOUGLAS C. SMITH, M. DIV., M.A., M.S. Yeah, yeah. 

00:44:10
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. ...pain. What's your favorite? 

00:44:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH Well, I, uhm, you, when you've shared that with me, I was reminded of another quotation by Pema Chodron and, and she said, "Our life's work is to use whatever we have been given to wake up." and she says, "It doesn't matter what we've been given... (crosstalk) 

00:44:30
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Hmm. 

00:44:30
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...whether it's physical deformity, enormous wealth or poverty, beauty or ugliness, mental stability and mental instability, life in the middle of a madhouse or life in the middle of a peaceful, silent desert. Our life's work is to use whatever we have been given- 

00:44:45
Continue to grow no matter what life has given. 

00:44:45
DOUGLAS C. SMITH, M. DIV., M.A., M.S. ...to wake up." And I think that's what we're... (crosstalk) 

00:44:50
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Yeah. 

00:44:50
DOUGLAS C. SMITH, M. DIV., M.A., M.S. ...we're, we're, we've, we're talking about, you know, somehow growing no matter what life has dealt... (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN, PH.D. Uh hmm. 

00:44:55
DOUGLAS C. SMITH ...us, no matter what we've received as a result of life endings. 

00:45:00
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN Uh hmm. Well, and Doug, I think, you know what, another one of my favorite poets is Mary Oliver and she has this lovely poem about living richly. I'm not talking, I'm not talking of finances. But I think if we can wake up and we can understand that loss and love are really, you know, two sides of the same coin that we can really be alive... (crosstalk) 

00:45:15
DOUGLAS C. SMITH  Yeah. 

00:45:20
LORI RUSSELL-CHAPIN ...and even through people or loved ones' death we can be alive and, you know, we need to wake up and I think that's what we're trying to let people know. 

00:45:25
