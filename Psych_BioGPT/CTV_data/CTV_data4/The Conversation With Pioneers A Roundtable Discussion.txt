Microtraining Associates, Inc. MICROTRAINING And Multicultural Development 888 - 505 - 5576 info@emicrotraining.com www.emicrotraining.com TEACHERS COLLEGE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY The 27th Annual Teachers College Winter Roundtable on Cultural Psychology and Education presents: Act Together The Hope of Community February 19 - 20, 2010 A Conversation with Multicultural Pioneers: Lessons from the Past, The Present, and for the Future Nancy-Boyd Franklin, Ph.D. Thomas A. Parham, Ph.D. Eduardo Morales, Ph.D. Derald Wing Sue, Ph.D. 

00:00:30
DERALD WING SUE, PH.D. This morning, I am acting as both a facilitator and participant in this morning's conversation with multicultural pioneers. Lessons from the past, the present and the future. Throughout the roundtable, we have frequently heard from attendees that they found the personal stories of pioneers and elders in the field extremely meaningful to their own experiences and their own beginnings as social justice advocates. As a result, the roundtable this morning has decided to do a special plenary session, this morning to hear from the voices of individuals who have made major contributions to the field of multiculturalism, diversity and social justice. The session is organized around three different major activities. We will have a one-hour session in which the pioneers in a conversation will talk about the experiences of their personal and private lives as they've dealt with issues of multiculturalism. Second, Dr. Melville(ph) will be facilitating a discussion of well known experts in their own right, who will have the ability to come and interact with the participants in a dialogue or conversation, to share with us some of their own thoughts, reactions to the pioneers who will be sharing with us, their concerns as well. Now, it is indeed an honor for all of us to be in the presence of true giants and pioneers in the professions of psychology and education. Doctors Nancy-Boyd Franklin, Eduardo Morales and Thomas Parham. Unfortunately this morning, Dr. Teresa LaFromboise took ill yesterday and could not fly here from California. So, we are going to wish her well and perhaps invite her back again for a future session with pioneer program like the one we are hoping to start today. Dr. Nancy-Boyd Franklin in the red blazer, which is so bright that everyone cannot fail to recognize her, is a professor of ah... ah... a professor in the Graduate School of Applied and Professional Psychology at Rutgers University. Dr. Eduardo Morales, at the end seated there, is distinguished professor at Alliant International University, an Executive Director and Co-founder of AGUILAS, in HIV program for gay bisexual Latinos and Dr. Thomas Parham is Assistant Vice Chancellor for Counseling and Health Services as well as adjunct faculty member at the University of California, Irvine. He is this year's recipient of the Janet E. Helms Award for mentoring and scholarship. And as most of you know, my name is Derald Wing Sue. I am professor of Psychology and Education here at Teachers College. It goes without saying that the combined scholarly works of these pioneers number in the hundreds not counting the numerous training tapes, awards and honors and distinguish appointments each has brought to themselves and others. In describing their accomplishments, I cannot possibly do justice to their productivity, commitment and monumental influence in the field of multiculturalism, diversity and social justice. In our society, however, we too often make sure peoples worth by credentials they hold, awards they have received, the number of publications on their vita and/or the number of important offices they have held. In the case of these four, these three individuals, their accomplishments would truly film monographs. But these are only incomplete manifestations of what Nancy, Eduardo and Thomas have become. True pioneers, whose multicultural wisdom and humanity have touched the lives of their families, friends, colleagues and students. They are all social justice advocates, as they quest to have the voices of those most marginalized in our society to be heard. What makes these three unique is their lifelong passion and devotion to multiculturalism reflected in nearly all their scholarly works and how they have lived their lives. The essence of these three pioneers is derived from their collective relationships to all people. Their genuineness, concern with the wellbeing of others and lifetime devotion to bettering the conditions of all groups in this nation. I know that their journeys along the path to multiculturalism has not been an easy one. Especially in a society that have invalidated the racial culture identities, attempted to define them as lesser beings, denigrated their ideas and scholarly works and question their right to occupy the same space as their white colleagues. This morning, all three leading pioneers in diversity and multiculturalism will share their experiences, thoughts and perspectives on broad issues related to their personal and professional journeys in the field of psychology and education. The discussion is organized around five major questions. One, what was it like to be a person of color, born, raised and educated in a primarily white mono-cultural society? Two, what lessons did they learn from theirs about survival, dealing with cultural oppression in their lives and work, and what motivated them to continue their fight for social justice? Three, how did they overcome the invalidations and dignities and obstacles to their racial cultural essence and integrity? Four, where did they drive their courage, strength and inspiration from? And lastly, what lessons would they share with younger colleagues and students about how to continue the multicultural and social justice journeys in the face of resistance and invalidation. And what I would like to do right now is simply join the group and I've asked Dr. Nancy-Boyd Franklin to start off with the question of what was it like of her to be born and raised as a person of color, educated in primarily a white mono-cultural society? Nancy. 

00:08:00
DR. NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Yeah, hey everybody, good morning. 

00:08:00
Good morning. 

00:08:00
DR. NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Come on now guys, this is the roundtable. Good morning. 

00:08:05
Good morning. 

00:08:05
DR. NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Okay, thank you. Derald sent us the questions in advance and as I was reflecting on that first question I realized the world was a very different place when I was growing up. I was born in Harlem and raised in the Bronx, in a low-income housing project called Bronxdale. Anybody from Bronxdale in the house. Okay. This is New York, you know, married in Brooklyn, but my experience... I was born in 1950 and that was before Brown v. The Board of Ed. And it's hard to imagine that part of the world now. But I remember the thing that I was reflection on was, what it was like to be a child in that experience and our low-income housing project was built in a white working to middle-class neighborhood. Everyone in the housing project was black or Latino and everyone in the surrounding areas was white. And I deeply remember the experience in first and second and third grade, being the only black kid in my class, and the only black family in the school. And what would start to happen, you know, AJ and I do a lot of work with parents. What would start to happen was that right in first grade the project kids were not invited to any of the parties. Now that may not sound like a big deal to you, but I've gotta tell you, when you are in first, second or third grade and your kids in your class not only don't invite you to their parties, but they don't come to yours. That's a very serious piece, very very serious. And that's the piece I know, for me that piece gets reactivated as a mother and a step-mother and a grandmother now. When I see these same things happening to my kids and grandkids, so I'll stop there. 

00:10:25
DR. EDUARDO MORALES Good morning everybody, I want to acknowledge my mother who is here. My father is retired and living in VA retirement home in Puerto Rico, so he can't travel. But... I was born and raised a few blocks up from here, a 138th in Broadway. So, I went to our Lady of Lourdes Grammar School and Bishop DuBourg High School, we went... My mother and father put me in catholic schools, because the public schools were so difficult here, which I think they continue to be difficult in New York. So, similarly mine, our neighborhood at that time was very mixed. A lot of different ethnic groups primarily, Latino, African-American, some Irish. It's quite of a... quite a mixture, and, and during Grammar School, our, my experience was more of a mixture of different kinds of children and families, that we were raised with. But when I went to high school, it's a bit different. For some reason, they wanted to experiment with the Latino students, and so they put us all in one class, because they wanted us to learn advanced Spanish, which on one hand was an interesting idea, because... but on the other hand you assumed everybody first of all new Spanish, and knew it well, well enough to be in advance class. But, they kept us for all the other courses in the same class, which was quite bizarre. And... And then the primarily white students were in the class called 1A, we were 1D. So if you think of four class A through D. So, it was that kind of experience when we first came in and then I went to the other school and the other university here in New York, Fordham University, Fordham College where I did my undergraduate. Hahaha... And the other ID school, yeah. And then after I graduated, it was a time when, to get into psychology doctoral program. It was more competitive than medical school. The only thing more competitive was veterinary school, right Derald? Derald mentioned that several times. And so you know, it's kind of like there were only 17 schools that were approved for counseling psychology by APA at the time. And it was kind of like you go or you get in, you know, there is none of this, oh I don't know, if I want to leave home. No, you know, you wanna be a doctor, okay, you gotta do it, you know. This is the real deal, take it or leave it. So, never been west of New Jersey, I got in to Texas Tech University. So you can imagine Lubbock, Texas, home of Buddy Holly and the only Prairie Dog Town reserve in the United States. But you should know that Lubbock, Texas was also the home of Texas Instruments where your computer chips were developed. So everyone has a connection to Lubbock, Texas. Haha... And also interestingly, there they had one of the first behavior modification residencies of the mentally retarded, which was basically very cutting edge, which was surprised me, because I thought, I was going back in time 20, 30 years. So it's kind of a... kind of a mixed experience, but then again, I was in Texas in the Panhandle, the buckle of the Bible belt, where you know truly on the other side of the railway tracks where African-American community and this side was the Mexican, primary Mexican community and, and there was truly a wide community and there were only 800 minority students in university of 24,000 students. And I was one of three minority students in the graduate psychology program of 160. So that's the kind of context, I was, I had. 

00:14:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM It's... It's amazing. Let me say good morning to folk. 

00:14:40
Good morning. 

00:14:40
Good morning Thomas. 

00:14:40
DR. THOMAS PARHAM It's... It's amazing as long as I have known my colleagues here to see the parallel in our story. (Inaudible ) associate me as a California snob, but I was actually born in New York, (inaudible ) Queens, St. Albans. And my mother and father separated when I was about three. So mama, took four kids and we went to California. So, I grew up in Los Angeles. So, my bones were reared in Canada, California sunshine, so that's a kind of way that goes. But what's important about that experience is that, like New York, LA is very much of a multicultural melting pot if you will... And so it provided a context in which you could grow up amid other cultural groups that made it, I think very nice. So, there was no place that I did live in parts of the city in the (inaudible ) with the Latino brothers and sisters in South Central Los Angeles, and primarily black communities in the kind of Fairfax, Wilshire District, you know with primarily Jewish brothers and sisters and you know all in integrated places, but it gave you a sense for that kind of multicultural flare and passion, that has really got at the lot of the work that I do. But for me I think I was born in 1954, in the year that is significant in terms of Brown versus Board of Education, on October 2nd and so share birthday with Brother Nathanael. So if you want to know where my warrior spirit comes from it really, you know, comes from those particular spaces. And I want you to know that Nat was a preacher first before he turned revolutionary. But much like most folk who don't read history, even a preacher has a limit to how much they can, they can tolerate. And so I've always found that interesting I think about that particular background. But growing up in LA was interesting because even though the West creates an illusion of being a more liberal and welcoming space, it always reminds you that this in fact is America and no matter where you go in America you can always find pockets of races and you can find pockets of liberalism, and you can find pockets of almost anything you are looking for and the West coast is the much more I think versatile place that, that, that has that. For me growing up amidst 1965 Watts Riots, when National Guard coming down the street against a very oppressive Los Angeles police force that anything that looks like it want to be black as up against the wild nigger, you know, and you know that kind of, of oppression sends a very interesting message when you are in the school system and they're calling your white colleagues, even though you know the answer and you know, you're raising your hand in the school system where, my mother put us in catholic school by the way. (Crosstalk)(inaudible)And when I was in the fifth grade, so another parallel I think that we happen to share, and despite the, the (inaudible ) church it is amazing to me how profoundly in congruencies between what they preach and how they live in terms of particularly races and the people color. But those experiences I think, taught me some important lessons, I think growing up. The first was that, that, I'm okay, you're okay stuff was really distinct euphemism for looking like, acting like, talking like and walking like, my Euro-American counterpart. And so part of what I had to do was to learn how to navigate that pathway. But I learned later on that there is a difference between values and skills. And that while you can develop the skills and technology of the dominant culture to be able to survive, there is nothing wrong with the values or some (inaudible ) with you from you know indigenous cultural folk in the first place and so part of that particular challenge has been able to navigate that space and so it is much like I write about in my research where, where there is always this, this tension that exists and it had existed in me. That is that boring(ph) idol that the boys talked about that is that, that tension between the integration and nationalist science about what is the best way to achieve social progress and liberation for black people and other people of color and ever poor whites who are, who are oppressed. And that tension I think to, to, to navigate that side, forces us to have to walk in two worlds and, and you know, what I've talked about in my writing is the notion of how do I maintain a sense of cultural integrity in world that doesn't support and from my humanity as a person of African descent, that became the central question for me, as a young child that I can now articulate I think as an adult. But I have enjoyed growing up, I think as a black man and, and, and blessed by the creator, to be who I am. And, and, and I thank the creator everyday for making me who I am and provided me with this unique time and space for blessing me in all the ways that he usually has. And I also thank the creator for blessing me with a social consciousness to be sensitive to other people's pain and to feel other people's sorrow and to be able to, to have a voice that you can raise on behalf of other folks, because of those developmental spaces. And what was interesting to me is, my mama who taught me some of the most profound lessons in life, raised four independent children, who went out and worked everyday for the Federal Government and expected that when she came home, dinner would cooked, clothes would be washed, etc. So, I have one sister who is oldest, my older brother Bill, myself and my younger brother Joe(ph), but everybody took a day, so we could all wash, iron, clean, cook, you know and raise independent folk to say, when I come home from work, everybody will have a responsibility everyday, and Friday was kind of catch all so you could just kind of do what you do. But it gave you a sense of, of not only independence but also a sense of collective survival in the family that really has helped to shape not only the way in which I relate to my siblings to the day who I love to death, but also the lessons I teach my own children as well as the lessons I teach students you know who are trained mentor. Finally I say, I think in terms of the, the developmental experiences, the central challenge for me, I think even to this day, being a 55-year-old black man, is much like Ames talked about, when he wrote, Protest and Irony in Negro back in 1950. When he said, I've got one man for white folks to see another for what I know was me. What was he saying? That if I live in a world that continues to invalidate me for being a black man, I get no validation at the University of California or at the University of Pennsylvania where I was before for being black. I get judged on how well I can articulate and conjugate verbs and calculate algebraic formulas and do those kind of things that are still in their cultural norm and so while I have to be able to develop the skills and do it better almost than my white counterparts can do it, I also can never be so far over that line that I lose myself in that process. You know, it's about, right, how do I maintain that cultural integrity in the world that doesn't support (inaudible ) humanity, I still got one mind for my brothers and sisters and the white community to see, but another for what I know is me. 

00:22:25
DERALD WING SUE You know Tom there is one of the things that, I think about when you talk about how does one hold, on maintain your own sense of integrity in the face of invalidations, insults and dignities, oppression that you experienced, I think about yesterday's opening key note, where a black brother identified himself as a sociologist, stated that where, where are we going to talk about sacrifice, the pain? I mean, there are people who die, you know and that, you know as much as I you know love and relate to my brothers and sisters, my white brothers and sisters, frankly what I find is that they have difficulty understanding the racial reality of people of color. So when you talk about invalidations, often times they, they think about it in a broad context without specifically what happens to a person of color from the moment they were born in the United States. And frankly, I can tell all of you, I was born in Portland, Oregon, not in Hong Kong, not in Taiwan, not in... And I make that point because, you know, people think that, people in the United States, true Americans look only, you know a certain way. The invalidations that I've experienced has always been that I am a perpetual foreigner and that comes out in many different ways from when I entered Abernathy grade school. And I can still hear the chanting of classmates, Ching Chong Chinaman, Eya, Eya... You know making fun of us. I can still hear the words of my counselor, Mr. Knutson in high school who well-intentioned as he was, making exceptions for me to take advanced calculus and, and physics thinking that I was really, he was making exception for me and I should be grateful for it. And I suddenly realize when he made the statement, "Don't be upset or anxious Derald. I know you can handle it, because you people are good at that". And you know realizing that Mr. Knutson, a well-intentioned white counselor, social science teacher was as much, you know, a much a victim of inheriting stereotypes of of Asian-Americans. That's what happened, so I can recall when I was Editor of the Personnel and Guidance Journal now known as the Journal for Counseling and Development and I became one of the youngest editors and I had this, naive vision, I was going to change the whole journal. I appointed people of color to the Editorial Review Board, we had issues that are dealt with, you know, multiculturalism and a huge movement from other professionals to, to, you know, get rid of me as editor of the journal and the stress that I endured was that I did not continue for a second three-year term, which was unheard of. Editors go for six years, they go three years and have a renewal for. I just could not take it and then feeling guilty that why can't I take it. You know, do I lack courage, am I a coward to continue. But at that point, when you begin to talk about the toll it took on me and my family was great. And I remember when (inaudible ) and James Jones and I, testified before Clinton's Race Advisory Board and this was shown on C-Span. The amount of hate mail that we received on public, you know, because it was on C-Span, CNN, came in which they came in threats that all of us, all three of us are, we were called reversed races because we talked about racism and that our days on this planet would be limited. You know to me that... I think about what happened to my brother Stan, one of the Asian-American psychologist and a well known Asian-American psychology, you know, they put his face on the Clan website as an enemy of the people. 

00:27:00
NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Yeah. 

00:27:05
DERALD WING SUE You know that's the type of, of, of things that many, I think white brothers and sisters who can become valuable allies and many of them are, don't see they don't go out, like you do Thomas, when you try to hail a cab, in your mind you must think about, is this cab going to pass me because of the color of my skin, white brothers and sisters never entertain that. Possibly, Nancy when you were on a panel with me one time, you asked the audience the question of, when (inaudible ) was killed and shot, how many of you here know what every black mother with a teenage son thinks about, when that... that doesn't enter the mind you see, different world view and part of what I think all of us are trying to do is to get others to understand the world view of, of people of color, it's hard. How to you for example, Eduardo, how you deal with it? What is your, the resources that you rely on to, to get you through? Because I now believe that we can't, we don't it individually. 

00:28:20
EDUARDO MORALES Yeah, that's a right question, because it has been a long journey. But... Some, you know something to, to, to also add to. When I was going to graduate school, being gay or lesbian was a disease. You could be kicked out of graduate school for being gay or lesbian. 

00:28:45
NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Within the DSM? 

00:28:50
EDUARDO MORALES It was in the DSM too. Okay. And it was only in 73, I went to graduate school in 72, we have the same birth year. 

00:28:55
NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Yeah. 

00:29:00
EDUARDO MORALES Hahaha... Since we are sharing birth years right? Hahaha... It was in 73 that the Psychiatric Association decided to remove it as a DSM diagnosis and it was APA in 74 that decided, okay, we're, we're going to do the same with the caviar(ph) that we created the stigma, we're gotta do something about the stigma which the psychiatrists didn't do, didn't deal with that aspect of it. But in any event that was, that's another dimension that is, is, is very difficult. For me it, you know, it was the journey of first of all coming out to myself and coming out of family and knowing that I was going to be more in the public eye, you know, I don't want people to see this on television before I tell them. You know, so there, there was that. There was also the lack of information. You know, how many have you heard of Evelyn Hooker's research? Okay, just maybe one or two people. Well that was in the 50s, where she actually did, took instead of recruiting subjects from bars, she recruited subjects from the community who are gay and then had the premier, three premier Rorschach experts to evaluate the Rorschach protocols blindly and tried to distinguish, which ones were gay and which ones weren't and they couldn't. Now that research was like squelched, it was never, never in any particular psychological literature, review about sexuality or anything, it was something that wasn't covered by a gay psychologist in the late 70s and 80s, where we said, who is this Evelyn Hooker. We suddenly discovered two to three of her research pieces they said, how come we then never heard of this before? And we are the psychologists, we're supposed to be the experts on this. It has been squelched by, by... And it was funded by the federal government. So, it isn't like there is some kind of you know, somebody who did it on their on their own little project with their private money. So it went through peer review process for approval and funding. So there were serious pieces of work. So for me that was some of the stuff. And moving from Lubbock, Texas, I went to Princeton for summer and then I went to DC for a year and then I wandered up in Sacramento for a couple of years, and then in San Francisco and... And I was there with brother Harvey Milk assassinations. And part of my journey included, because I am a musician, I was with the San Francisco Game when it started out. And we decided to do an eight-city tour of the United States. And part of that journey was, we had to talk among ourselves, we are a 150 of us who went on that journey. To talk about the possibility of violence that somebody might take an opportunity and take a shot at us literally, and try to kill us while we were on the road. And that was something that, that really came up. So... And a personal story I want to share, which I've really never told this to anyone. Nobody here knows about it. But you know working in the minority community, it has been also very difficult. And I had an opportunity to help this non-profit organization in San Francisco when it was really down and out and, but ready to be defunded, if they didn't get their qualitative clinical procedures together and it was a Methadone clinic that they were doing counseling in essentially booths, you know, there was, you know, there was no confidentiality in terms of, people could hear everything so, and that no taking was really terrible so they wanted me to go and help clean up what was going on and train the staff and... So anyway I did and so I was clear with the staff that they had to develop their skills and start writing things you know the way they need to. And I was there for training them on how to do it and there was one individual, this big guy who is about 6'4", huge man, very well trained in lifting weights and, and he was, he was not gonna do it. I mean, and I warned the staff. I said, "Look, you know, it's a, it's a put up or shut up situation, because you can lose your jobs in this you know. They are gonna pull the funding if you don't do this. So you gotta get on with the program here". And so we had a deadline of when we needed to get this stuff done and the guy just didn't want to do it and I had to ride him up. And I said, "Look, he hasn't done it, we gave his trial periods, he is now on probation". When he, when he got to know, I was in the Executive Director's office and he stormed in and stood right in front of me like this and I did not want to look at him, because I knew that if I did, he would, he would knock me out. And he started cursing at me and calling the names, derogatory names as threatening my life and the Director was there standing watching and saying, "Oh don't do that, don't do that, don't do that". Finally he left and you know, all I could think of during that time was, you know Harvey Milk, I mean, this is like, this is gonna be, and my name will be on a paper, and you know, here is a person who is killed in a clinic. And I left and interestingly, I never got a call from the Executive Director saying, hey, how are you doing or how are you... I had to call her and say, I am not going back until the situation is taken care of. So, to me these were kind of the experiences, you know. So the journey has been long and, and troublesome. And you know where do I seek support, obviously my friends, close friends that I can talk to about it, my colleagues, we've shared many things. And those are places where I, I get some strength and where people can really understand that you know, you know life is like, like on the line. It's... It's more serious than what you think. 

00:35:35
DR. NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN I had a loose association to that. I was thinking back to when my youngest son, was about five or six and I used to read him stories every night and I read him a book about Martin Luther King Junior and a book about Malcolm X. And each of these stories ended with their death. So one day, he was bright little boy, one day he said to me, "Mommy let me get this straight, Martin Luther King Junior spoke up for black people and they killed him. Malcolm X spoke up for black people and they killed him. You are daddy speak up for black people. And I had to sit there and tell him, don't go there, you know, but that was very very painful kind of thing. I want to go back toward Derald said earlier. You need to know something, all of you who do this work. When I was a kid growing up during the Civil Rights Struggle, I remember saying to my parents, "Is racism ever gonna go away?" And so they looked at me and my daddy said, "Well, baby there is bad news and there is good news. The bad news is it probably won't go away in your lifetime. The good news is you get to take it apart everyday, brick by brick for the rest of your life". Now, I think you need to know that and I don't see that as a negative comment, I see that as a social action comment. But I was thinking back Derald, we'd been, you have to know that many of us up here have been through the trenches together and that's what keeps us strong. But I'll never forget, you need to know, it's really important that you know, that it doesn't go away as you go up the food chain, alright. I came into Rutgers as a full professor with tenure and I am teaching my first year, and my students know, I have all my students write journals. So they know this story. But what happened was that, this young white man, and I honestly believe that he didn't know how serious this was, wrote in his journal, I was really surprised to see that you are such a good lecturer. When I heard you are hired, I thought you are in affirmative action hire. Now I've gotta tell you, thank god, the reason this child is still walking, talking and breathing is because, I read this the night before at home. And as many of you know I am married to a wonderful therapist who pulled me off the ceiling and taught me down. So that by the time, I am there with this child the next day, I was in a different place, alright. But you got to understand that it doesn't go away, every time you go up for a promotion, your work will be challenged. Every time you speak, your work will be challenged. And you need to have that as, when AJ and I write about it, we wrote a book called "Boys into Men", raising our African-American teenage sons and we talk about something that our families both mine and his did for us. How many of you all are parents? Alright, here is what you gotta do. My parents and AJ's did a form of racial inoculation, alright. They talked to us about racism. When it happened they said, when the kids didn't invite us to parties. They explained that it wasn't about us, don't take it personally, alright. This is racism and you need to understand that, alright. So that it doesn't get you down and that's huge, I mean, if you talk about how did personally, how do I survive? Where does it come from? It comes first from family, been very very special in my life and passing it on to the next generation that piece that Thomas talked about, remembering who you are and projecting who you are. Because for most of our generation, you have to remember that we lived in two worlds, alright. There was our world at home, for me in the projects and then there was that world in Catholic school, very different worlds. But we continued to live in very different worlds. My students know. They've seen videos of my church service. AJ and I are members of a Baptist church and I tease my faculty, my Sunday mornings are very different from my Monday mornings. And for me, my spirituality is just a tremendous, tremendous part of strength and courage. You know, you may not realize it, but I am not sitting here alone today. There is a whole bunch of prayer warriors back at my church, in New Jersey, who are pray and be up, alright. And who pray, they know AJ and I travel a lot, so they pray us up all the time, alright. But you know, you've gotta bring your own, I am not talking now about religion (inaudible ) I am talking about what Thomas was talking about, your relationship with the creator. You've gotta bring that into your work. I had a call not too long ago, from a young sister who was going up for tenure and I swear she had done everything she could do, but it was the weak when they were voting on her tenure and she was a (inaudible ). So she called me up and she said, "Nancy, is there anything else I can do whatever?" And I said, "Well have you tried prayer". And heard silence on the other end of the phone. And she is like, ah... oh... here goes Nancy again, alright. So, I said, "Well", she said, "Yeah I pray all the time". I said, "Yeah, but have you called the prayer warriors you know and told them to lift you up". And there was silence on the other end of the phone. You know, that piece that Eduardo said, you can't do this stuff alone, you know, you just can't. And I just want to throw out a term for you, write this one down, if you're just getting started, professional extended family, alright. How many of you all are the first one in your family to go on for this highfalutin education? Alright. My family, I remember when I applied, my family told me, well first of all they didn't believe in psychology, so we had do that number but, anyway, they told me, you know, you're gonna have to find, you know, we'll always love you, we'll always be there for you. We always have your back, but we don't know a thing about the field of psychology, so you're gonna have to get some folk, who can help you through and be like family. Well, if you look around this room a lot of the folk in here definitely the folk up here are part of our professional extended family. It's huge. And I just wanted to say something about social justice. It's not popular, okay. You really need to understand that, all of us, we're on J. Edgar Hoover's list, we're proud of that, alright. That means we sat in, demonstrated, did all kinds of mess, alright. In fact, AJ is now with us today, because he was one Richmond 34, the first folk to takeover lunch counters in Richmond, Virginia. And they are having a reunion of the Richmond 34 today. But I need you to know that you've gotta have people who have your back. Can I hear a (inaudible ) on that. You gotta have people who have your back. And I want to say one more thing and that is pick your partner carefully. If you're gonna be about social justice issues, think about someone who shares those values, because it ain't easy, alright. And there are risks involved, okay. And the kinds of threats that Derald was talking about AJ and I have received and you need to understand that will happen, alright. Whenever I return from a trip, members of my church family remind me no weapon formed against you shall prosper, that's very comforting, alright. Because they are weapons, you need to understand. We call it the arrows. And your partnership, your relationship has to pull out the arrows that are shot, not at one of you but at both of you, okay. And put on the bomb, alright. So that healing is so crucial to having the courage to go on. You need to know that everybody has down days, alright. Everybody sitting up here believe me, all of us have had down days. All of us have had days when we've wondered if it was gonna be enough or wondered if we were doing too much. But you gotta lift yourself up, dust yourself off and go on. You know, there is a wonderful documentary. How many of you all have seen "Eyes on the Prize"? Alright. Remember the song, Keep your eyes on the prize, hold on, alright. One of things that helps me is I keep my eyes on the prize. So that when those arrows come, it doesn't destroy me and it doesn't destroy those I love. 

00:46:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Just want to say that again. 

00:46:15
NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Amen. Hahaha... 

00:46:20
DR. THOMAS PARHAM (Inaudible ). For me I think, it's interesting to look at the, at the contrast as we talk about, you know, what lessons and survival do we, do we take and I am struck by something, you said a few minutes ago Nancy about, you know, you came from parents, both you and AJ who felt it necessary to (inaudible ) their kids, so that you, you provide this kind of intellectual emotional behavioral and really spiritual force feel that allows and to resist some of the slings and arrows that are there, but I think that, that in my experience that is the minority of African-American parents. 

00:46:55
NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Yeah, yeah. 

00:47:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Because my mama bless, bless her soul, was on the other end of traditional mamas, who was less word about teaching me about racism, because what she was more interested in doing was trying to tone down my blackness. Because she understood like most historical mamas understood that, that's not (inaudible ) get your feel, it hurts and that'll cost to your life. 

00:47:25
NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Yes. 

00:47:25
DR. THOMAS PARHAM And so to be out in those particular spaces, I used to scare my mama. She's like, "Son do you understand?" And so you know the LAPD is one thing, the Catholic school is one thing, the you know, this kind of navigating the streets is one thing, but as you said it doesn't stop, you know, and it raises a fundamental question about what is that we learned about the lessons that come to us. You know, what are that lessons in survival? And I am reminded about what is the most profound lesson I think for me, that I think I would you know certainly share with other people. It is important to remember that if you're a part of any kind of group who lives at the margin, what they are called the faces at the bottom of the well. 

00:48:20
NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Yeah. 

00:48:20
DR. THOMAS PARHAM There will always be, those instances of the unjustified suffering, the unmerited pain, the undeserved haunt, the question is never, this stuff happen in your life. The question is how do you sustain some movement or momentum in the face of that adversity and so you keep on keeping on. 

00:48:40
NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Yes. 

00:48:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM And keep on keeping on is not just a refrain we sing in church or on Sunday morning when the preachers acknowledge and that there is some pain and tragedy and struggle in your life, but no matter how dark it maybe in the night, when the morning comes, everything is gonna be alright. 

00:48:55
NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Preach! 

00:49:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM And that's how we move through life and that's what we do in terms of creating our own cultural comfort zones what Nancy is really taking about is how do you create for yourself that cultural comfort zone, that both allows you to connect with allies, right, but also allying yourself with people whose knees will not buckle under struggle. And it doesn't matter what you become. I was blessed when I finished graduate school to become what I didn't find out until later was the first academic African-American psychologist that University of Pennsylvania had ever hired in 200 some years. When I went to Pam. And I am coming out of graduate school, SIU Carbondale, trained by Joe White and Janet Helms and other folk (inaudible ) Carbondale, how is life. But, and so, I really got upon me you first you had a school, you think, okay, this is pretty cool. But you learn very quickly that the microsalts and (inaudible ) don't stop because you're on the streets of Portland or Harlem or New York or Los Angeles. They go all the way up until the tower and so if you think there is somehow the higher you rise the more you insulate yourself from that, you don't. It just comes in a different form. 

00:50:15
NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Definitely. 

00:50:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Alright. There is a old saying we learn on the streets that we used to wear hoods and you know conehead clanting(ph) with the eyes out now we wear judges robes and police uniforms and now are deans and department chairs and promos and other folk, I mean that's we'd come. I remember going to Philly, trying to remind folk that we live in a city that is 44% black and we are trying to doctor our students to go out here and somewhere I read in the APA journal, manual, that it ought to be unethical to go out and practice on, folk you are not trained to practice, but we got no courses in African-American psychology (inaudible ) institution, in 1982, when I am teaching on the faculty there. And I simply raised the question, "Excuse me, but somewhere I read". 

00:51:05
NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN His mama was praying for him through this whole time. 

00:51:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Three thousand miles away, my mama praying and my colleagues, my... these are my white allied colleagues, who said, "Shhh... That's not a way to make tenure". And some knocked down drag out kind of discussions that you have, you know, in vigorous debate, it wouldn't quite knock (inaudible ) unless too dramatic vigorous debate. I had a faculty stand up from your professor in the department and used the word nigger. Why did he say that for? Because you know it's like... (crosstalk)(inaudible) And, and you try, you try, in your best life to allow the intellectual skills to remain and not put them in the pocket and have the ghetto skills come out, you're not gonna work for it, in the name of who, but it test you, you know, when really guys test you, and what is interesting to me is not just for those of you who teach multicultural psychology it's not just (inaudible ) that come from your colleagues. But even the sense of entitlement and privilege that comes from students. I am a ideally professor, been on the planet longer than most folk, and I got students coming into me, right, to question, right. Now, one of the biggest ones have to do with what I think is an interesting issue, because on my wall were pictures of some African-American leaders and there is just another folk, but you know, I am a integration as a national synthesizing on opposites right. So on the wall also was a picture of Farrakhan who've had been blessed to me. And a folk, "Oh Farrakhan!" In one day walks three students all were Jews and I am sitting in my desk the picture is here on the wall, and they're looking right at me, won't turn and look at the picture. "Dr. Par, we understand you have a picture of Farrakhan on your wall". You know, I'm like, you know some part of me is not believing it's like, "Ah..." I said, "Yeah he's right there". "We have a problem with it, because he is anti-Semitic". "Really!" I said, "Okay, have your seat". So I invited 'em to sit. And I simply informed them in the best intellectual voice I could, that "have you been to hear him talk, because every time I've heard him talk..." Who has heard Farrakhan's talk before. Really less than about two hours a shot, sometimes three, yes. And most of the time he's talking, he'd been real critical of Blackfoot and are ways in which we need to pick our self up, there might be a tense I can sound but it immediately picks up where he's critical of white folk or Jew folk or somebody, but most of the time, he is about self-helping and (inaudible ). I said, "have you ever heard him talk", "oh no". "You ever read anything he has written?" "No!" "Have you ever, you know, heard a videotape or watched it or something of him?" "Oh no!" I said, "It's really odd thing, you know him is (inaudible ). So really, you've not even qualified to have this conversation with me. So, what I want to invite you to do is go and then look at that, but let me also remind you that you're being in my office is a privilege, not a right. So if you decide that is objectionable for somebody on my wall, you know, winger me some place else outside probably in the conference room, someplace but don't get it twisted here, you know, this is not you know something that you can come and confront". And by the way, because I know we got some all the colleagues around here who are Jewish brothers and sisters, but I want to know, if you went in and confronted them about books about (inaudible ) and other folk who when they were hidden the Israeli defense forces warned United States that you better be careful about all these black troops, you got in the military because the next World War is gonna be fought on African continent, I don't think black folk will go and fight other black folk, you think they gonna be that sense of betrayal like black will have no patriotism, but did you go confront (inaudible ) colleagues about that. We didn't know they said that, but you are not qualified to have this conversation with me. Right is that kind of stuff that doesn't stop even when you get up into the space. So what does that mean, there are several lessons I think to me that they are important. The first thing I do is, I always know who I am, and whose I am? I never forget that. Who I am and whose I am? Secondly, always learn to contextualize struggle. One of my students said, I'll teach you all that, you got to always contextualize struggle. So for me contextualize your struggle is I'll keep a picture of Malcolm one other wall and the ancestors in the slave dungeons on the other. Because it reminds me to contextualize struggle. Parham in a slave ship and if the ancestors can get to that I can get through a little bit of this. 

00:56:15
NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Yeah. 

00:56:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM They say (inaudible ) inconvenience really, right. What does your Obama do? right. And that was the some inconvenience. The third lesson I think that I learned is, you have to be able to in maintaining your mental health to create the broadest range of choices and options. Fundamental lesson Joe White taught me. But also, when you go into systems we have to be able to assess what environments will tolerate. So you've gotta have a radar on when you go into any system, doesn't matter whether it's a job, school, whatever, graduate school by the way, students it's not a democracy, I'll tell you, you got the one (inaudible ) right. 

00:56:57
NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Hahaha... 

00:56:57
DR. THOMAS PARHAM So even as we teach you this multicultural stuff, you're the really the second generation, because we turn off new generations by every five or six years, you're the second generation, who now will know more about multiculturalism, than the people who will train and teach you. When you go out and do your clinical jobs, when you go out to other places, you know more about that than they do. 

00:57:15
NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Yeah. 

00:57:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM And they are very expert on process, but no expert on content and so you have to warp against that somewhere, but you gotta learn what an environment will tolerate, right. Your job is to get your degree, not try to convince somebody about the air of their ways. And lastly what I learned, and I learned this lesson humbly from brother Farrakhan. He said, "he who prescribes the diameter of your knowledge also prescribes the circumference of your activity". Let me say that again. "He who prescribes the diameter of you knowledge also prescribes the circumference of your activity". What's he saying? He is saying that, if people define for you, right, what is your own knowledge base, then the world keeps you in the circumference of this activity about how they ride and restrict the boundaries around which is appropriate for you to traverse. So part of what I have spent my life to in the spirit of courage (inaudible ) is understand that the biggest problem that we face as black folk is not drugs, gangs, violence, poverty, racism or white supremacy. They are big obstacles, but for me the biggest problem is what I call the need for mental liberation. 

00:58:30
NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Yeah. 

00:58:30
DR. THOMAS PARHAM How do we take the shackles off the brain and my life has spent time trying to unleash and unlock those shackles, right. They keep us so conceptually incarcerated that we are free to think outside the box to do something different, then we know it's the right thing to do. 

00:58:45
NANCY-BOYD FRANKLIN Definitely. There is a poem, actually it's a very sexist and racist poem, but there is a pact, there is a stanza in it that's very helpful, it's, by Rudyard Kipling, if you haven't seen it google it. "If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you and make allowance for their doubting too". There are times when you have to do that for yourself, you know. You used the word before Thomas warrior, I am a warrior, anybody who knows me more than five minutes knows I am a warrior, alright. But I have to tell you that it's tough being a warrior, you know, it's tough being a warrior for generations, you know. It's tough. Many of you have studied racial identity theory. But Thomas wrote something about racial identity theory that I think is really true, at least it rings true for me personal, personally. The stages are cyclical. They don’t happen once. All right. Every time there’s an encounter you go there. Every time you know emersion(ph), emersion(ph) you don’t pass through it once you go there. Ah but the encounters keep happening not just for you but for those you love. You know... ah I can remember the time my oldest son my step-son was in ah Brooklyn Tech one of the top high schools in New York city and he came up on his senior year and his councilor told him ah well take those first five schools of your list you’re not going to get it. Well I want you to know some warriors went up in there and talked to his councilor all right. Ah but that piece that Thomas talked about you known activating the geode (inaudible ) in all of us ah it happens and it happens on a regular basis. It happens when I sit in faculty meetings. And defend minority students. It happens when I sit in admissions meetings and fight to get young people into our programs. It doesn’t go away okay. And you've got to understand that I, I cant say that strong enough that if you understand that you won't be thrown when it happens all right. I remember I came home from college and I ah my daddy was a high school drop out all right but he had a lot of what we call wisdom all right. And I came home and I’m studying psychology and I said well you know just think about racism you got to decide if its you or if it’s racism. He looked at me like I had lost my mind he said baby when you have to figure out if it’s you or it’s racism wonder first if it’s racism it’ll preserve your self-esteem all right. This is from an uneducated black man all right. And that kind of wisdom is very important because ah I think you have to hold on to the armor(ph) all right. But not allow it to hide your heart. That’s really what Thomas is talking about. 

01:02:25
THOMAS PARHAM But you got to… you got to share your armor(ph) too. 

01:02:30
NANCY BOYD-FRANKLIN Absolutely. 

01:02:30
THOMAS PARHAM Because the armor(ph) doesn’t just happen for individuals it happens even collectively. 

01:02:35
NACY BOYD- FRANKLIN Yeah. 

01:02:35
THOMAS FRANKLIN We wonder the things that, that are point to as a, as a just hurt me in my life was watching my brother here who I consider just an icon you know beyond the fact that I just love him and he’s a friend and watch what his family want to he, he is arguably the most prominent Asian American psychologist and if you ask black, white, blue brown or purple folk who the top three or four psychiatrist are on the planet. He’ll come up on everybody’s list. 

01:03:05
NACY BOYD-FRANKLIN Everybody’s lists. 

01:03:05
THOMAS PARHAM You'd have, you have no clue how lucky you are to have you it ready. But sometime you won't be able to share the armor(ph) when you hear right the, the invalidations that, that's your colleague and your friends and your brothers have to go through in order to do that. And it brings stuff out of you even then. It's not just about you defending yourself but you're having to defend you know your friends because there had to be lessons out of that. 

01:03:30
NACY BOYD-FRANKLIN Yes. 

01:03:30
THOMAS PARHAM …you know for you that became, what was the very painful spikes(ph). 

01:03:35
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. You know ahhh this I’m I have an unenviable task which is a, to keep time on this. But when Thomas started talking about me I said well maybe a couple more minutes hahahaha. I’m, you know I’m...so one of the things that I think we’re learning here is that these are too short. 

01:04:00
NACY BOYD-FRANKLIN Yeah. 

01:04:00
DERALD WING SUE …ahhh that I in the future when we have another one of these sessions we should have more time I think for us to, to share the tender parts of ourselves with the audience and I do want to thank Ed and Nancy and ah Thomas this morning as we now transitioned I think to the second part of our ah activity and I’m going to turn this off. First of all let’s give them our hand.

Reaction to Pioneers: Perspectives from Leading Multicultural Psychologists Etiony Aldarondo, Ph.D., Norweeta G. Milburn, Ph.D. Michael Mobley, Ph.D. Rebecca Toporek, Ph.D. Facilitator: Marie L. Miville, Ph.D 

01:05:15
MARIE L. MIVILLE, PH.D. I’m so grateful and thankful for our incredible elders ah I’ve just have been in their company since I was a graduate school student and so it's incredible to be up here on the stage with them. So other than of course saying yeah what they said ah we’re going to ah ah attempt(ph) to also have our own conversation assort of the next generation of of scholars that have taken on this mantle and and are in the midst of our work. So I’m very pleased to welcome four wonderful leading scholars and all of them are actually I invited them because they’re all doing work ah that links up with the theme of our, of our roundtable this year which is on community based ahhh interventions and so first I’d like to welcome Etiono..ahhh Etiony Aldarondo who’s an associate dean for Research And Director Of The Dunspaugh-Dalton Community and Educational Well-Being Research Centre and School of Education at the University of Miami (inaudible ) and his scholarship focuses on ah positive development of ethnic minority and imigrant youth if any of you were able to go to his workshop yesterday absolutely searing(ph) information and work that he does do with unaccompanied immigrant youth who actually got on the trains the top(ph) of trains from Mexico to come to this country. And just amazing heart wrenching, heart breaking work. Ah but so important because it ah thousands of people everyday every year are coming in that way. Work with domestic violence and social justice oriented clinical practices. He’s also ah done an incredible book on social justice I’m going to promote it again and it’s a 20% discount if you buy it here. Ah Advancing Social Justice Through Clinical Practice. Ahhh Norweeta Milburn from UCLA is a research psychologist in the department of psychiatry and bio-behavioral sciences and her research interests also they include homelessness, substance abuse, family interventions and mental health and she’s actually one of our ah associate editors from ah a major journal that all of us are interested in cultural diversity and ethnic minority psychology. Ahhh Michael Mobley, Michael and I go way back to graduate school so we’ve known each other for many many years. He’s now an associate professor at Rutgers ah in the department of educational psychology. And his expertise in research interest include multicultural counseling competencies, perfectionism ah scale development, self empowerment theory which is very ah propel for for what we do today. Our work with school settings and resilience and racial, ethnic and gay and lesbian identity development models. Ah and I have to say he and Rebecca Toporek our other guest were co-chairs of a very important social community engagement project in New Orleans. How many of you were able to go APA in New Orleans. But they actually did this fantastic project of just being ah organizing psychologist to do interventions while we were at the APA in New Orleans. And so now what they have continued (inaudible ) a community engagement section or a task force with counseling psychology division so that that’s not something that just happen at one conference. It's something that we’ve now put on ah into more formally in our division. And then finally Rebecca Toporek who is an associate professor in department of counseling at San Francisco state. And she too is also very interested in social justice advocacy, multicultural training, systemic interventions and discrimination community engagement and career and college counseling. She also like Etiony has this fantastic book on social justice so we have two with a primary scholars who have begun actual work that we can go and ah you know put it in ah written form about ah issues to deal with the social justice. So I also wanna promote that book and is now working with the journal for social justice and social action and counseling in psychology. So welcome. 

01:09:40
[sil.] 

01:09:45
MARIE L. MIVILLE, PH.D. Well and so I thought what we could just do for now is just any thoughts or reactions, comments that you have for our wonderful guest that opened up our conversation. 

01:10:00
MICHAEL MOBLEY I’m willing to say some, I’m willing to talk initially first ah but very briefly. We had this discussion about which one of us would go first ah and as we’ve all acknowledge I wanna thank our cultural elders and for what you have done in the roads and journey’s you travelled. Ah the testimony and I think as Derald said bring about the tender aspects of their heart and their essence of their character. Ah really continues to feed my soul ah and I’m a person who is a believer. I’m a strong believer in god and I pray constantly and I’m giving gratitude and thanks to God for various different experience I’ve, I’ve had over the years. Ah both the good and the bad I think we need to ah remember that we can learn from some of the bad experience that we ah encounter. Ah one of the things that I wanna share with our elders is this ethical principle of truth telling. Actually hearing the realities of their experiences I think often times as professionals ah I know I’ve gone into a number of conferences and I love to hear about racial identity development, the recycling aspect of that to hear about empowering African-American children and families to understand about how we can become better multiculturalists. Um but somehow, we don’t often times hear about the hidden aspects of our elders in terms of their lives and challenges that they’ve had to endure. And some are ever grateful that they’ve taken on those challenges and that they have be able they’ve been able to be warriors and fight battles for us fight battles for me that allowed me to actually gain access and to counseling psychology Ph.D. program. I maybe not have to traverse the same absolute sort of past that they had because it’s a little easier knowing that they’ve come before me. 

01:12:00
ETIONY ALDARONDO All right so um welcome (inaudible ) Good morning to all of you. And I, I had a great supervisor I had a lot of good supervisors in my life thank God. And ah one of them when I was about 21 I think I was seeing my first client ah who knew that I was, I was a very bookish type student. I read about everything that I could so he said to me Etiony when you’re there and when you’re now meeting with the first client and you get stuck which you will get stuck right away just, just, just think, think that ah all of the grades are on your shoulders, and wonder what would they say. So actually after 30 years of doing this now I have the grades on my shoulders so I might turn back to them and ask you for some suggestions about what you said, ah so finally came through. Ah the, the, I, I should start the comments with a couple of ah caveat to I cry and I cry often. I cry in public so, so don’t, don’t really be upset if you see me crying I have a good friend Jerry Tello(ph) who tells me… 

01:13:15
MARIE L. MIVILLE Yes it’s okay for men to cry. 

01:13:15
ETIONY ALDARONDO …yeah, yeah it’s okay yeah and I have a good, my great friend Jerry Tello(ph) tells me you know crying is just a sign that you’re alive. 

01:13:20
MARIE L. MIVILLE Yes. 

01:13:20
ETIONY ALDARONDO So ah so if you do see tears coming down there’s not no need to stand up and hug me now but you can do it later. And so anyhow the ah my, my let me make a couple of comments I mean there were so many things that I was writing and in fact all of them ended up with great, great, great so I can’t really go back to my (inaudible ) they’re really useful at this particular moment. But, but what I, I could tell you I have a ah, ah I’m very grateful for the work that you and, and others of your generation you know had done. And then allow us to kind of like to open up the doors in academia and in, in, in our profession for us to do the work they were not trying to do. By the way I think that there’s a lot of other folks in the audience there’re ought to be here I feel a little bit kind of like a stranger sitting in this, in this part. But my experience and my, my journey into social justice ah is a little different. It’s a perhaps a lot different from, from what I heard here because I am to some extent a child of privilege. And I’m not the, the Porto Rican from the (inaudible ) story movie in a in a sense and although I… you know I, I, I sort of became and I learnt very well as when I came to the States because I grew up in, in a colonized country. I grew up in Puerto Rico. And so if my, my, ah growing up and my father was a political scientist. My mother was a social worker. My father was ah relentlessly skeptical of the world. And my mother was unbelievably optimistic about the world. So, so as I resolved in an interesting ah in a fortunate mix of ah genetic and social forces you know I am ah I live with a deep skepticism of today and remember the world with great optimism, which is so my memories are very optimistic you know in a sense and when my, my interactions are always like Um what else is going on. Who is else is you know as my father is always there in my shoulders asking me about that. Now anybody who’s grown in a in a colonized country probably can identify with the feeling of knowing that your official word is not really the truth. You read the paper. I used to be a paper boy in my neighborhood. So, they…I knew the news before everybody else took the paper around. And I knew that, you know it’s like well, this is what they’re saying. But this is not what they’re really happening. And my, my dad would then quiz us on the table about the whole thing so I was instructed that way. Ah so thus I come to this issue of social justice in a sense and say that impart not so much for ideological or, or for an experiential part but more in almost in a pragmatic way ah it become for me a socially adjust..adjusted world works better. It works better for everybody. It works better it seems that in every domain that I go and look, it works better. In economic terms, in developmental terms, in health terms. So is, is a very rationally simple answer for me to kind to make so I feel very comfortable in that and, and so in that regard is a little bit different. You know because they’re more related. 

01:16:55

01:17:00
MARIE L. MIVILLE Norweeta would you like to. 

01:17:00
NORWEETA G. MILBURN (inaudible ) to Rebecca. 

01:17:05
REBECCA TOPOREK If you’d really like… 

01:17:05
NORWEETA G. MILBURN No I, I will go. 

01:17:05
REBECCA TOPOREK Okay. 

01:17:10
NORWEETA G. MILBURN Well those of you who know me I’m actually a person of few words but I, I must say it’s quite an honor to be sitting on the stage with these people and I don’t really want to call them elders because I’m beginning to reach that point myself so…so, I will just say to be sitting on the stage with people who have um I think shared with us such a wealth of experiences and I too was taking notes while you were talking um and I there are a couple of things that I just want to piggyback on a little bit and I think on one part that Tom raised that I wanna emphasize in particular I think um like Etiony my background is a little different I describe myself as an army brat. I was raised very much in integrated environments where I was often the integration. Um you know I, I, because in many ways I do come from a privileged background. My parents were college educated um I lived all over the United States. I’ve lived outside of the United States. So in some ways my experiences are different but in some ways they’re very similar. I, when you're talking I… really this conversation it does kind of raise that pain that we go through just some of those experiences of being, being the only one, being singled out, being expected sometimes to be the voice for all of black America. Ah I can remember at times in high School because I did grow up in 60s and 70s and you know things are going on and people looked to you to share the black experience. Um so with that in mind what really struck me was for people to understand that my experience is a black experience but it might be different from the experience of the black person in the inner city. And I think for many people it’s hard to understand that and I think we see it probably most clearly with our president Barrack Obama. Because many Americans are shocked to have black people like Michelle and Barack Obama. But many of us these are people that we grow up with. It’s not a surprise to us. You know we are very diverse group of people so I think one of the things that we see on the stages are diversity. But there are all are also commonalities among our experiences. So one of them is the pain I also thought that our speakers did a really good job not hitting on that word that I deal with probably on a weekly basis and that’s anger. I mean I think that Nancy and Tom framed it in very good ways talking about that warrior(ph) perspective um but I sometimes feel it is anger you know I think anger when you things that you said are not heard until either a male or a colleague who’s not of color states it and they’re heard. And so there are gender issues. There are race issues but I thought you did a good job not getting at that, that anger because that could be counter productive sometimes. Um one of the things that struck me too when I was thinking about some of the commonalities is the experiences that I go through as a mother. I have a 16-year-old daughter um and I think of the way that I try to raise her and we, we had a lot of conversations about race and racism because she’s growing up again in a very, I think a very privileged environment and she knows that. But something that struck me the other day with all the things that she’s gone through and I will say I drive a very old car so that I can keep her in a very good private school and she’s gone through private school all of her life. And I was struck by I was talking to a parent the other day but not seen my daughter in a while and she used a word that I really rale against I mean um Derald talked about stereotypes but a word that I find very discomforting is when someone describes me as being articulate. You know of course I’m articulate I’ve had a good education. I have a Ph.D. I should be articulate. What’s the big deal? This mother was talking about my daughter and the word she used with me was I’m amazed at how and my daughter’s name is Sarah. How articulate Sarah is. And I was talking to her on the phone and just I had to stop for a minute and I’ve known this lady for a long time and I didn’t wanna start ranting and raving so I just said, yes she’s fine in her own voice. She speaks well. But I thought (inaudible ) describing my daughter is articulate? Of course she’s articulate. She should be given her education, her background and her experiences. So those and it’s those because it’s those my progression they continue to occur. They occur with us they occur with our children. And then the last thing I’m gonna say is I really wanna get back to this notion of this professional extended family. And the reason that I mentioned my background and experiences and being the only one sometime is that I found that professional extended family has been so helpful to me. I have been at three universities um because I tend to follow my spouse I was at Harvard. I was at (inaudible ) University and I’m now at UCLA. And I use that extent of professional network in all of those place. I was fortunate enough to be trained at the University of Michigan, um and I worked on the National Surveys of Black Americans so that professional network began their impart for me there. And I can tell you there are people here, there are people at UCLA um like Gail Wyett um people like James Jackson who I can call upon when I need to and talk to them. And sometimes I don't call in them and talk to them but sometimes they look out for me in ways that I’m not aware of then I find out about later. I can’t see but another person is Joseph Trumbull(ph) who I think will be here may be here or here later today. These are just people who really look out for you, help you um and the one thing I want to say about this professional extended family. Not only is it supportive but it’s also the group that I can be most honest with. Um one of the issues that was raised about earlier was also knowing the systems that you are in. And in those systems you have a public face and a private face. And I find with this professional extended family I can always show them my private face and they’re also the people who’ll be the most honest with me and forthcoming with me when I raise questions about the work that I’m doing or my professional life. So I’m really saying that to the students here to really begin to build those networks. I, there are other people that I rely on as well. Most of them are people of color. They’re not all people of color. So I’m gonna stop now and let Rebecca talk. 

01:24:30
REBECCA TOPOREK Um thank you all for going before me and I appreciate Etiony mentioning the crying in public park because when I was sitting back there and listening to everybody I thought to myself how am I possibly gonna be speaking. My heart is in my throat. Um and, and it’s there because of all of the stories that they’ve told but, but it’s there probably more so because these folks and many people out here and people who’ve been at the roundtable and others that I won’t go in to mention a long list really have such a huge impact on my life as, as a from young adulthood to now and I grew up in a really different kind of environment. I grew up in a primarily whites college community. But in a family that um didn’t really fit ah we were transplanted there and, and I sort of didn’t really fit. And I think that ah one of the things that has…was really significant for me as a young professional was that a number of these people and Derald probably being the first one and Thomas and then a number of others. Actually asserted I feel like it took me under their wing and um allowed me to see a part of ah… the fear of the world and myself in a really different way and I felt really honored to have been able to see that and very blessed and it, it made a huge impact on me in the direction that my professional life is going. And so I first wanna say Thank you to all of you and actually all of you because you continue to make an impact. Um and thinking about the differences in terms of as a white woman and, and I, I have to say white woman are not female white or whatever because, because the white part is a much um a, piece(ph) that I think a lot more about than the gendered piece(ph) in fact I have a number of ah women colleagues who will, who will say, oh did you notice that success thing that happened and I say no, but I really noticed the racist thing. And so I'm trying to work on the you know understanding the success part because the racist part is the part that, that I think I have more ah attention to ah as a white person and I think some of it is when I was thinking back to you know a difference I guess when my progressions happened and with a very good friend and colleague just the other day we were we were there and have been processing for the last two days ah I don’t even know microaggression may be. But ah initially so, so for me those kinds of things trigger differently. So they don’t trigger experiences that I have had to deal with personally my entire life as the target of those types of things. Ah it triggers for me a sense of responsibility and a question about how do I respond? What’s the best way for me to respond in this situation and understanding the context and what the, what the environment will tolerate as Dr. Parham said and also what’s my role as a white person. Should I step up and say something right now. Should I not take over the situations trying to decide ah because it is really important for me to say something so initially in starting off in social justice and multiculturalism it was a community, this extended professional family ah that was really significant for me and a really sense of importance to do the right thing. And in coming into the professional extended family I realized that that’s actually shifted now for me. I suppose to just stepping up because it’s the right thing. It’s because these are family members to me and when I see family members get dissed that’s not right. Ah and so, so the crying in public park would come in time ah… so those were the the main things that I just wanted to say and, and ah for me I think the, the humility and veracity and compassion that Pamela Hays(ph) talks a little bit about and her thing is a really important thing for me because I am really in process I’m only half baked sort of person in professional and always sort of trying to think about how to approach this process and take the wisdom of and I say elders in that wisdom sense not so much in the age sense. Ah… and, and how can I constantly take that and evaluate and reevaluate instead(ph) of my place in that and my responsibility and when the times get tough when you get sued for $10 million for stepping up and being the mom who always brings up the entire thanks giving stuff. Ah having that professional family is a really, really important thing so I just wanna emphasize that. 

01:29:15
MARIE L. MIVILLE Thank you thank you and you know for me every single one of you have been so important to me every single one of you. And I would not be the person or the professional that I am without knowing Derald, Thomas, Nancy and Eduardo. Because each of you have just if, if you weren’t you and you haven’t stepped up to the play and opened your mouth, open your soul, open you heart to all of us I don’t think I would be here sitting here now inviting dialogue conversing with my colleague of my generation and inviting the new scholars, those many of you sitting in the audience. So to that I thank you because I know it’s been hard, there’s been many sacrifices, scars, wounds unhealed things but also triumphs along your way because we’re here because you’re here. And so for that I thank you. And I thank you for taking this chance with feasible(ph) activity, which is a brand new one for us, ah and we’re excited just to be able to have this kind of a conversation. Um you know I think about my youth and what strikes me about some of the parallels of your, your childhood and what you’ve talked about and I grew up in Miami ah at the time of… 

01:30:35
ETIONY ALDARONDO Yes! 

01:30:35
MARIE L. MIVILLE That’s right. Ah (inaudible ) like um I grew up in Miami at the time when there was ah a lot of ah latino immigrants coming, mostly from cuba and so there was a lot, a lot of overt hostility rage, anger, fear grief um you know people leaving their country with bullets flying by their ears. Ah that kind of ah travel that kind of a transitions to a new country and then of course the people living in Miami saying well who are these people coming here. And, and there are many reasons why people come to this country and I was really struck by Etiony’s work yesterday and that you know the notion that civil rights the blood that shed is still being shed today to this very day. People will lose their life because we do not treat each other with humanity, with justice with um openness and acceptance and so there are still children, there are still families who everyday suffer the indignities the injustices and worst than the wounds into their bodies because we do we fear each other and we still see each other separately rather than as brother and sister, as family and so on. So you know when I think about my own journey you know one of the things that strikes me as part of this racial ethnic tapestry is the language issue you know and I was raised at a time when my mother came to this country she’s colombiano ah being a child and she handing me the phones so you talk to this person because he’s not treating me right and so you know being 11 years old and talking to some sales man because he was treating her like she wasn’t worth the person to speak to. Ah and so that those indignities continue today in so many ways. And so that our generation and your generations sitting in front of me we must continue that work. You know that is for us as well to step up to this play to feel our own anger to fight that injustice ah because if we don’t ah it, it continues. It just simply continues. Um when I was looking at the, one of the questions that Derald has asked us all to, to think about you know, how do you overcome invalidations, indignities, and obstacles? Of course my first style is joking with Nancy like really I’ve overcome them? Um and one part of that question in terms of obstacles yes when there’re challenges that are about seeking an education or a job or something like that to me I feel that warrior spirit if it’s an obstacle lets figure out how we can beat this thing. But when it comes to the invalidations and the indignities the, the internal stuff that goes on as, as we move on this journey those are the pieces that are the hardest part of all this. And I do share the, the, the comments you know the warnings and the just the advice about seeking your professional family because we all share them in this room. Um and it doesn’t make necessarily those scars go away but it certainly validates our invalidation and um it’s in that process that I find the healing and feel the hope for change for our future. Just account when you how…how each of you have thought about in terms of that part of it, the invalidations, the indignities or where you draw inspiration to continue this kind of work. ‘Cos all of you have done just amazing work, Etiony may I start with you? 

01:34:25
ETIONY ALDARONDO Yeah, ah it’s some of it seems simple to me like a I, a lot what I do, I do for my son and I do for my wife. Um I don’t believe in God. I don’t believe in, in, in spiritual beings in that sense. So I, I, believe in relationships and connectedness and, and, and so, so it is, it’s sometimes very simple to me is it to what extent what I’m doing is making life better for him and for those who would come. I often think also I don’t know how is it gonna happen with grandchildren’s and those who come I think it will, that would be great if whatever we do now helps (inaudible ) we’ve been setting up and my wife told me we had to pay their debts now forget about the debts that’s coming you know where they put in their bank money in the bank for those who come later. So we may be should set up fund for the great grandchildren’s who are coming later on. I said no, no, no let’s get it that’s right. Hahahah. So we’re working on that (inaudible ) so yeah so, so for me it some of it is, is, is that is, is been focused on, on that and the primacy of those ah those commitments for me which is, is very much tied also with the whole learning to be an American if you were, because I had to learn to be an American being here, mainly by being a father. You know I was is, is ah I can take, I feel very comfortable with all sort of indignities and attached to me. Ah but I, I’m less diplomatic and less able to deal with the attacks to those who are close to me. And so in having to see him grow and deal with the schools and his…I could talk to him for hours by the way and my students know that so he’s a handsome, jazz musician and great student, great talent, a great human being. Ah very gentle too. A very gentle guy very ah so in having him (inaudible ) deal with these issues with bullying at school or with teachers that we’re making the wrong choices. That to me was kind of like ah a lot more difficult and, and it was about a learning experience about what it is to be here. You know what it is to be um so I do where, where I find comfort a lot is it right there and I find that, in that, in the network of what you describe as a ah I think the professional network I mean some folks are talking about (inaudible ) consequential strangers and who turn for you. Ah and, and, and I have a whole bunch of consequential strangers in my life. People who are kind of like who mean a lot to me that my students are some of them and, and I’m always kind of like connected to them they currently bring innovation, they bring happiness they're not concerned same issues that I am, they often see things differently. And, ah, and, and they seem to have great confidence that things will move. You know some… 

01:37:30
MARIE L. MIVILLE Good to hear. Michael? 

01:37:35
MICHAEL MOBLEY Um I’m sort of mixed emotions and also in my mind is as racing, ah but one of the ways that I find support and get strength is first at home with my family ah talked a bit about my past, my mom doesn’t have a high school education she actually didn’t get her high school GED probably now about 70 years ago. But she had me when she was 16 years of age in April of 65 and this is a revelation that I made probably about eight years ago. And I have a sister who actually her birthday was just a couple of days ago February 17th Michelle so there is Michael and Michelle. And everyone always thought we were twins and that’s probably because she was born 10 months after me in February 66. And so about eight years ago I realized wow my mom had two babies before she actually advanced one year herself. So both of us were born when she was aged 16 and then she turned ah 17 march 30th after my sister. Ah so at home you know having an uneducated mother who also suffered with some of her own challenges ah particularly around substance abuse, alcoholism, um it was sometimes difficult watching her pain and most of her pain was crying at the table because I think she was lamenting about not having her mother around anymore, but my grandmother died before my sister was born, so somewhere in either the late 65 or early ’66. Ah and so watching my mom’s pain is always facilitated I think to me the sense of sincerity, the sense of cultural empathy. I cry at a drop of a hat. You know movies even this you know 30 second commercials will trigger something in me. You know and I’ve always been curious about that but that’s why I’m a counseling psychologist right. Ah but, you know something here that’s resonating with me in terms of strength is my family. And one of the thing I said about my mother when I finished my dissertation is that she’s a, a silent supportive loving mother. Because I could not talk with my mom about my dissertation and perfectionism or confirmatory factor analysis and (inaudible ) for her even know what that meant. But I was very excited to be able to show her my papers or show here when that journal article came out and she also enjoyed and celebrated that success with me. Despite not knowing anything about it, and so one of things I continued to do is to share my success with my mother without having expectations for her to meet me or engage me in the way that my professional extended family members do, and as those professional extended family members did really provide me with the type of support I need in academia. Um I go back to one of my best co-work member Stacey Pearson as she and I wrote about a cultural emphasis(ph) we had around our identities. She’s outside philadelphia I mean in Chester, Pennsylvania. And I need to tell us very briefly as a gay African American male, I really tried to embrace that part of myself along with my African American identity, as Stacey and I were working on this paper, this presentation proposal for some conference and I also needed to take her to the airport and State college so that she could go to her reunion down at Norfolk. And so as I read the final proposal before about to put into mail I realized that she’d edited out the gay part. It was a case example about being gay and how to deal with that and how to deal with those thoughts (inaudible ). I immediately looked at her and I said first of all we don’t have time to discuss this so it’s going back in and when I give I’m gonna truck it to the airport and then when we get back, and you get back we’re gonna have a discussion about this. But right now it’s going back in. and I love you and that was that. And I took care of business and then we processed it afterwards and she told me she said Oh boy I knew you wouldn’t let this go, I was anxious on the flight (inaudible ) but we have such a healing, loving relationship right now between she and I and I find so much support from her because we went there, to that difficult place in our personal and professional relationship despite having some cultural similarities there’s some significant differences around gender, sex orientation and race. Um the other piece that comes up for me which I think I’m only becoming more and more aware is not having a father in the home as an African American male is just a tremendously ah forceful impact on one’s life. And I know this when I said I believe in God I often at times refer to god as father and that’s intentional. Because not having a father but I need to have a sense of a father in my life. And some male professionals in counseling psychology in particular had been cultural image and cultural role models for me as father figures. And of course my advisor not being African American has been a very significant father figure to me and actually I’ve referred to him as my father because he and my dad actually share the same birth date but different year. Ah and then I learnt you know recently that his mom also has the same name as my mom’s name Edith(ph). And so there’s a lot of things that may be brought by (inaudible ) and I together but when I think of Thomas Parham I think of Don Pope-Davis, I think of Hardin Coleman who actually was one of my high school teachers they’re all and some of other African American males in this profession have been cultural father's to me, had been role models for how I can conduct myself within the arena known as ah professional world in academia. And so I wanna thank them for providing that leadership providing the sense of direction and purpose for me in terms of not having a father to provide me with wisdom in that way. 

01:43:20
MARIE L. MIVILLE So I think, I think you’re asking where did you courage, strength and inspiration? 

01:43:25
NORWEETA G. MILBURN Okay, because for me, for me it really starts with my family um with my parents um I’m I think very blessed in that. My mother and father why they don’t fully get what I do as a psychologist um they are supportive of what I do. um and given my father's experiences in particular he’s someone that I turn to a lot for professional advice because he has been um for most of his professional life has been um I'll just tell you he's a retired army colonel and he had a very high position in the federal government so he’s often been the first for many things. So I’m able to talk to him about some of my experiences and get good advice from him and he’s very good with problem solving and staying focused and I would say from my mother she has a wonderful sense of empathy. And I think the one thing that I’ve learnt from my mother and impart why I focused on homelessness for most of my professional career is that my mom has been very good at teaching um me to understand and think about you need to treat people the way that you want to be treated and answer the words that I’ve really um that’s really what I’ve learnt from my mother so it doesn’t and you treat everyone the same um one of the things that she’s thought me is you know people who do not you know if your not a not a Ph.D. your not an M.D. you might be um a secretary you might be at some other level within university but your role is just as valid, you’re just as important and you need to treat people the way you wanna be treated. So that I’ve got drawn on that for support and then I was thinking I do have professional colleagues who I’ve tried a lot on for support and some of those people are here. But I also have a very good circle of friends and most of my very closest friends are women of color they’re not all African American women but they are women of color some are professional women some are, are not. Um many of them are mothers. And that is the group that I go to for a lot of support um just talking about what it’s like being um what it’s like being a work…a mom who is working outside of home and very intense professional settings um. These are people that I can cry with that I can laugh with, um these are people that help me stay real. Um they help me get off my high horse sometimes um so those are people that I drawn on for support um I am a very spiritual person I’m fortunate that I belong to a very um progressive church um and I do draw on that church a lot. Um my approach to prayers are little different. Um I will say the church that I go to is an Episcopal church um, we have a very diverse congregations it’s important for me to be around people of different colors as well as around people of different um sexual orientations. So our congregation is very supportive of gay lesbian um, transgender sexuality issues where congregation um, we’re very committed to social action and social justice so going I drawn out a lot for support in terms of the type of work that I do. So I guess just to kind of summarize I’d say family friends, there's definitely that professional circle and then there is that spiritual peace that just helps keep me focused. The last thing I’ll say I’m also lucky enough to be married to a person who is also a psychologist um we went to graduate school together and we share a lot of similar experiences and my husband is very good at helping me reframe kind of like Nancy he does take me off the ceiling a lot. And the other piece that I didn’t talk about is I’m not a clinician. I’m a researcher. I’ve been a researcher all of my career. So I am um and I most of my researches funded by NIMH ANIDA’s so I’m going for those big grants and that’s um that’s a story end towards itself so he deals with me a lot when I do my proposal writing and I get scored or not scored and get upset because they don’t understand what I’m talking about so that’s and he’s been very good at that level of support. 

01:48:10
REBECCA TOPOREK Um I’m gonna try to keep it short but I, I realize that it’s gonna be difficult but let me just start and maybe historically. Um so, so initially in my family I mentioned feeling sort of out of place even though ethnically racially, um we look like everybody else but one of the things that my parents despite their mental health issues they both dealt with um and my mom hadn’t graduated high school and my dad had a masters degree in architecture so the gender issues there. But both of them were, were pacifists and socialists and philosophical activists that didn’t actually act in a large scale. And so with that I think did for me in terms of support on a daily basis is a really strong belief in what is right and a discrepancy between you believe it’s right but I don’t see you out there doing a lot and so feeling a sense of commitment to okay well if this is what we really believe we really need to do something about it. And so they continue to be very supportive and I think may be pleased that I’m actually acting on their behalf. Um but then going in, in professionally up the historical timeline whatever, as a community college counselor I had the opportunity to work with some really, really wonderful people who also took me under their wing and um just say Jackie Russell(ph) Shirley Kawazoe(ph) two other community college counselors who um were, were kind enough to, to work with me and to trust me enough to say yeah you know I think really you need to rethink about how you dealing with these students and to challenge me in ways in a gentle way in a loving way to, to look at myself in the work that I was doing, and to force me to really do what I was doing differently and then that really made a huge difference and um we became the, the (inaudible ) um first we were the gang of 10 then there were the (inaudible ) and that was by the person who was suing us all. Um and that’s how we were named and what I saw in that process we had we had challenged the um particular staff person within the college for a discrimination around race and gender and disabilities, um and so he sued us all for it for liable and all that. But what I saw was the anger and how productive anger can be and being socialized as a woman and in the household that I was socialized and anger was not something to be expressed. Anger was something bad, anger was something scary and anger was something that you didn’t do. And in the process of going through this lawsuit I actually saw the productive side of anger and I saw how anger could be really used as fuel in a productive way um to work towards something that was more just and so that was a really useful lesson for me because um that’s not what I was thought. And then following that a few years later I, I had the fortune of seeing Dr. Sue, Dr Parham, and (inaudible ) Dr Allan Ivey(ph) Dr Judy Daniels(ph) and Michael D'andrea(ph) and Don Sealock I’m doing a presentation talking about the need to integrate multicultural competencies into the counseling profession and I was so stunned with the way that they work together as a team and the they almost sort of beautiful orchestration, choreography of their presentation that was in the early 90s I think that I saw them and struck with, with how um strategic that, that needed to be um and how well that was done and that really provided a lot of you know we’ll go back to the professional extended family that really solidified for me the importance of having so many different types of people and, and being very explicit about what needed to happen so this around the lawsuit time also was, was happening and so it was really clear to me that that needed to happen. And then just the last well actually two last things I wanna say one is um so then when I decided as a community college counselor that I really wanted to go on and get a Ph.D. because I wanted to really be able to write about um multicultural issues I specifically chose the University of Maryland because Janet Helms was there and her work was so influential for me in terms of the interaction of racial identities. And Don Pope-Davis was also there um in multicultural competencies. So I moved all the way to Maryland left San Jose California and left those supporters who had challenged me and moved to Maryland and I had um my first meeting with Janet Helms and I, I said Dr Helms I have to tell you that the thing that I’m most afraid of being here is that I don’t have the people around me anymore who will call me on things who will challenge me and so um I’m asking of you, Do you know any white people who you trust that I can go and try to develop a mentoring relationship with um because I felt like it wouldn’t be appropriate to ask her to do that for me but that may be she knew some people that she could recommend and so that was really helpful for me because she did actually refer me to a couple of people um and she also was kind enough to, to keep mentoring me as well. Um but that that was I think really important and one of the things that I would share with any of the other white folks in the audience is to really look to try to find other white folks and not to call on your colleagues of color to do that for you unless they chose to do so. Um and then the last thing I wanna say is I’m very blessed to have a spouse that actually I’ve been with since before I had this transformation in my identity. We’ve been together I’ve known him since I was 17 um which is really odd I think um I mean hahaha. And we’ve been together for like 26 years and he’s an engineer really does not you know have a whole lot about psychology works with bunch of engineers a bunch of guys and so you know we, we’ve been together so long that um you know we’re kind of on the same page in a lot of things. Um and he doesn’t really understand a lot of what I do and why I do and why I get so aggravated and irritated. Um but he is completely there for me and so he takes care of the kids, he takes care of the house. He lets me go after conferences multiple times a year and takes care of everything and doesn’t ever say that I shouldn’t be doing this or I shouldn’t be doing that.

I want them to see a sense of justice and to feel the responsibility for that and I wanna do that in a way that I’m (inaudible ) them into it but that they naturally blossom into it.
