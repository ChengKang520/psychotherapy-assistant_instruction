4th Force: The Multicultural Paradigm Interviews First Interview Cirecie West-Olatunji, Ph.D., Associate Professor, University of Florida Allen E. Ivey, Ed.D., Professor Emeritus University of Massachusetts, Amherst 

00:00:30
UNKNOWN Hi, I'm here with Dr. Allen Ivey and Dr. Cericie West-Olatunji. And what we're gonna be doing today is talking about multiculturalism as the fourth force in counseling and I'm pretty excited to interview the both of you cause you've been, uh, really the movers and shakers of helping to forge the move and then sort of take it to a different level in terms of how you incorporate multiculturalism. Uh, in counseling psychotherapy. Um, so I'm gonna just ask you a series of questions, it's so we can, in the hopes that you can elaborate a little bit more in terms of what multicultural counseling is, on how do you operationalize it with students, or I mean with clients, in, in counseling and psychotherapy. One of the first questions I wanted to ask was really, what got you involved in the multicultural counseling movement? How did that begin for you? 

00:01:20
ALLEN IVEY I guess I would say for me just personally as a child, experiencing an awf-, I mean I'm white, and I experienced an immense amount of repression in el-, rural elementary school in Mount Vern, Washington that named the guilty. And my father ran a small grocery store, and every day I went to school I would be called the K word, or Jew-boy or something like that day after day. And then as parents would come in the store I'd have to smile. And I didn't really talk to anybody that really understood me till I was couns-, counseling at Boston, University and I said hey, these Jewish kids from New York had an experience like mine, so that basically kinda results in kind of an underlying passion for the movement. How'd I get into it? Uh, that's another story, but uh, I'd like to pass it on to you. 

00:02:10
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Well it's very interesting to hear that, I don't-, of course my life has has a similar kind of trajectory of, uh, being marginalized, uh, in a lot of different ways and, and education realm, I think is probably the largest, um, body of experiences for me. Um, but where I came into multicultural counseling, uh, I remember working in higher education, I was working at a medical school, and I was wondering why are all these bright students having difficulty getting through the medical, medical school curriculum? And I noticed they were all non-traditional in some kinda way. Uh, the school, uh, was very open to a diverse population of students, so they were interested in students who were not only the traditional pre-med students, but also students who were uh, world-renowned ballerinas or, um, were musicians, but also they had, um, orthodox Jews, they also had, uh, ethnic diver-, ethnically diverse students, and I noticed that it was that group of non-traditional students who were struggling in the curriculum. And I didn't know anything about, uh, the field of counseling at all, but I wondered what is it about this demographic of not being conventional that created this disconnect for these students who are on paper, should've been doing very well. And I discovered a program at a nearby university uh, that had a concentration in multicultural counseling. Took my first course, and fell in love with counseling as a discipline. And then also gained some understanding and some answers, some knowledge about what it means to be marginalized. What it has to do with our ability to function. Um, and how it can compromise our emotional and psychological health. So, that, that's how I came into it. 

00:04:00
UNKNOWN So it sounds like for the both of you it's really been your personal experiences that got you involved in, in the multicultural movement in a sense happenstance a little bit. In terms of recognizing unfairness and trying to figure out what that all means for the both of you. When you think about the movement, if you will, sort of, in your experience, how did it evolve, multicultural counseling as a paradigm, as a fourth force in counseling as apology. 

00:04:30
ALLEN IVEY Now that's something that I haven't really, happen to think is terribly, terribly important. Because these Africans and African Americans that really form the foundation of the whole multicultural movement, which means we go back to Steve Bilco (ph) in South Africa dealing with apartheid. Martin Luther King, uh, and they sor-, and Desmond Tutu (ph), sort of-, basically the moral foundation for getting us into counseling, and so I just say that it's very important to say that, and the early people that were involved in this, Charles Thomas, the first cultural identity theory, and then Bill Cross comes along, identifies more precisely and then a whole raft of people evolved from that. The women's movement evolved from that, gay pride movement evolved from that, the disability movement. All that stuff I think came from, my perspective, those key people. How would you react to that? 

00:05:25
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI I would agree with that, um, I would also say that I've probably entered into this with, uh, more of a historiography of um, what it's been to be of African descent. Uh, in the US, so actually I would go back to uh, early psychology in the United States where you know what I think about is the term drapetamania (ph). And this was a term that was used for, uh, enslaved Africans who were running away. You know, so that was a psychological term for people who're running to freedom that was a pathology. So you have these early scholars who built on that understanding, yes, absolutely, that uh, people who're different are being pathologized. For thinking very correctly, for having their heads on straight. So it's that I think that fuels this whole movement that says that we really do need to think about multiple realities, and that if we look from a different lens that we would conceptualize people differently and have a different kind of understanding of what the behavior would look like, and what the etiology would be for anything, so, um, I would add to that, that you know perhaps we could go back even further to say that, um, there were people who were resisting that kind of hegemony, a cultural hegemony even earlier. 

00:06:55
ALLEN IVEY Oh, yes, it goes back and the, and you can go back for centuries, if you like going into African history, it's incredible. Incredible, so, uh, in terms of getting into counseling, and I guess for me it becomes Bill Cross, uh, and his cultural identity theory which is kinda the foundation of this, would you agree with that? 

00:07:10
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Absolutely. 

00:07:10
ALLEN IVEY And then- 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN Can you say more about that? His, his work and how it- 

00:07:15
ALLEN IVEY Okay, well basically, we'll work together on this, okay, basically I wish Bill were here, I feel like I'm in an exam, now. But, but basically there is sort of a naive stage, you're not aware that you are cultural being. And, uh, basically you kind of-, this is the way things are. And, uh, an African American or gay person would, gay person will stay in the closet, the disabled person will say well that's the way the society is, I just have to accept it. And they don't do anything else and so it's basically that what they might call a naive stage. And then along comes an encounter stage, and what happens at the encounter stage? 

00:07:50
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Mm-hm, they begin to have some dissonance, of course, because they experience things that they don't understand, so, uh, an example that's been given to me in my training is, uh, perhaps the, man who thinks that anyone can join a fraternity, for example, on a campus. And they think, well there isn't that kind of discrimination. I think anyone can anyone can get ahead, and they apply to go into a fraternity and they're not accepted. And they might apply again and they're not accepted. 

00:08:25
ALLEN IVEY And they begin to realize that really it is unfair, it's not me, it's the system. 

00:08:30
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Yes. 

00:08:30
ALLEN IVEY Hmm, and so how of this, comes the emotion of anger. And we, we heard the phase, you know, black pride, so forth, uh, gay pride, I remember in, uh, north Hampton, Massachusetts, there's a strong lesbian community. There's a white male walking down the street at one point was very uncomfortable for me. Is all, because there would be lesbian population who saw a white male, sometime they'd actually directly confront me in the street even though I didn't know them. Uh, a lot of anger and frustration. And interesting enough another stage appeared in north Hampton, and I think it's with which I would call, I think it's called sort of, I would call reflective period, or the, the lesbian community suddenly disappeared, and they got together in their own consciousness-raising groups, how do we wanna be in north Hampton? The veterans in Vietnam were, were kind of the same thing. But black consciousness-raising groups is the model. 

00:09:30
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Mm-hm, absolutely. 

00:09:30
ALLEN IVEY And the other people, adapted what originally came from black consciousness. 

00:09:30
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Mm-hm, absolutely and I think if I understand, uh, you know what, what uh, Dr. Cross has done is that he's presented us with this idea that um, these developmental stages are necessary for us to reach, uh, this crystallizing identify where we can discern better that we're, we're better, we're not using, uh, these very static, uh, demographics to be able to define a, what alliances we have. Instead we look inside, we look in people's values. So this idea of sort of going into a cocoon, and learning about oneself, increasing knowledge about one's reference group, uh, is necessary. So we need to go through that stage where, uh, we really surround ourselves with these like-minded people. Um, but eventually, as we move through that we begin to think in more gray areas, so in the example of the young man who would apply for, um, to go into a fraternity, who would pledge a fraternity and would then perhaps decide that they have this very strong black identity, would refute all their white friends, every body, just categorically, you know, it's like, we're not going to engage in our interactions with whites. Um- 

00:10:50
UNKNOWN Kind of dichotomous-type thinking- 

00:10:50
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Well, yes, because they need to go into this cocoon to really appreciate, there, there has to be a, uh, a mechanism to reject these negative, uh, negative, externally-driven views of one's reference group. Absolutely, so there has to be that stage, but that same young man might begin to realize that his best friend is this, uh, you know, white young man whom he grew up with forever. And that this person really cares about him and uh, perhaps can be uh, a supporter or, uh, can be, uh, someone who was an alliance for him and, uh, and so he needs to begin to think about that, well maybe I don't wanna throw away that friendship. Maybe that's a very deep friendship, so I need to make space for that. Somewhere, so there is this second stage of confusion where they emerge out of, uh, this cocoon and begin to see things more clearly to say well it's not categorical. Well maybe some white people really can be friends and understand what I'm going through. And then that's, there they have the potential to move into this synergistic stage where they can make decisions about uh, their friendships and their compatriots based on more deeper values. Would that be, something that you would- 

00:12:20
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, the integration, I think that's a marvelous summary, and, and for practical purposes in the counseling movement law, what it, what each different style of awareness needs a unique approach to counseling. Now this is one of the great approaches in multi-cultural counseling. We do individual counseling, and we do this exactly theory in this particular way. Multiculturalist however, says hey it's a little more complex than that, folks. It's a little more complex than that. And if you're a person that's coming with a more naive consciousness, the goal is to help them become aware of who they are, because they don't have a sense of identity. And if they're dealing with anger you're gonna have to support them, make I, the white person, they wouldn't, probably wouldn't want to talk to me. I might be, as a white person, might work with them reflected-, that each level of consciousness needs a different style and different theories in the, in the, oh it's the good ol' theory books. Will be helpful at different stages, but don't, those people wanna say this is the theory I'm going to use, I think is a, a probably very dangerous thing. 

00:13:25
UNKNOWN So it sounds like in a, if I can summarize what you're sh-, um, sharing is the multi-cultural counseling has really provided a framework to understand culturally diverse clients in a different way, in a way that doesn't necessarily apologize for clients, but in a way that helps us understand their experience from a different lens, from a different overall view, being able to see how issues of equity and fairness, uh, impact people psychologically. And it sounds like what you're both also saying is what's happened in the field of counseling is, in psychology has really been a microcosm of what's happening in society in terms of the civil rights movement, the gay and lesbian movements, the disabilities movements, it's sort of a evolved and influenced the counseling profession and, and it's forced the profession of counseling and psychology to sort of look at themselves and look at how are we being inclusive. Uh, and providing, uh, uh, multi-culturally competent services. 

00:14:20
ALLEN IVEY And it also kicks back another way, and we haven't paid enough attention to this, counseling itself is the evolution of consciousness. This point has not really been realized. And you get a person who comes in, they basically, many of our clients come in as a naive level conscious about the nature of the problem. Depression, anxiety, you name it. And they think it's their fault. That's a naive consciousness. But a lot of therpers theories will reinforce that naive consciousness and keep them coming for therapy annually. So the issue here is the African American Movement and the other ones, we said there's, there's a person and social context. Until you see yourself as a person in relationship to others, rather than as an individual, and again, this is a very linear individual. You are who you are connected to, is equally important. And so very helpful for me in terms of clients from all races, ethnicities and so forth. And white folks in particular need to know, we too have a culture, and we-, a lot of naive white folks that aren't aware they're white. 

00:15:25
UNKNOWN So multi-cultural counseling is really shifted the paradigm of how we can help people from an intra-psychic paradigm looking internally at what's going on in terms of cognition, thoughts, and feelings with a client to really looking at clients in context of a larger environment and how does contextual factors, socio-political factors influence what's going on internally. 

00:15:50
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI What's resonated for me is this word consciousness, and um, there's a term that's being used at, uh, discussion of disconsciousness and disconsciousness theory, and the idea that this, a moving people from a disconsciousness to a consciousness, and that this idea of these external factors of these contextual factors really impeding peoples' ability to develop fully as human beings. So when you place it on the level of being fully human, that that's what's wrong with racism, sexism, homophobia, is that it prevents us from being fully human, and it doesn't matter which side of that you're on, whether you're the person who is inadvertently even perpetra-, perpetrating that, or whether you're the person who's experiencing that marginalization. That it, it depletes us of those things that make us fully human, and so this idea of moving from disconsciouisness to consciousness is something that's needed, that's why when you, when we look at the multicultural counseling literature, uh, we, we have this idea of awareness, one's own awareness, awareness of one's story. Of where one enters into the work that we do with our clients. Is that it's got to be beyond this cognitive intellectual level of well, I sort of understand these issues of poverty, or I understand intellectually about racism. But we have to be present in order to develop that therapeutic alliance, to actually move people in, you know through their developmental consciousness. We have to be aware of what are we bringing to the table. What's our story, where did we enter into that. And so a lot of times students don't understand, well, what is my supremacy have to do with being a good counselor? You know, so what does that have to do with anything? But it's because you can't be present, you're not fully human until you deconstruct those racist aspects of your identity and reconstruct a cultural identity. One that's based on some substance and some humanity. Then we can move from disconsciousness to a greater level of consciousness. 

00:18:05
UNKNOWN A couple things come up for me as, as you both talk about this. Is, one is what happens when clients become conscious of their situation and context and gain that critical consciousness, um, what's a therapist role. And then the other sort of question that comes up is, what you're talking about doesn't sound very neutral, which in counseling and psychotherapy traditionally, counselors have been trained to be neutral with their clients, and what you're talking about in terms of creating this consciousness is, is a little bit different. 

00:18:40
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, but I would say it's neutrality is naive consciousness. Why do I say it's naive consciousness? Who dr-, who wrote our theories? White males. Uh, and so we come up an individualistic helper-healthy, therapist-patient, relationship. And that really is a model, that is a power model, which is I think predominating throughout the counselor-therapy field still. And the, the difference in the multicultural train, you wanna move more, I, I would argue that all counseling therapy needs to work much more on egalitarian contextual view. It's that simple. It's the person, in context. And you are egalitarian working with, rather than on the client. 

00:19:25
UNKNOWN What you're sort of saying is clients don't exist in a vacuum. And to really have a comprehensive understanding of what's going on, you need to look at the larger picture. What happens when clients become aware of their situation in context in the therapeutic realm? What's, how do counselors deal with that? Cause I would imagine there's a lot of emotion evolved from leading from something's wrong with me to, well maybe it's not me. 

00:19:55
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI I would imagine they would move to action. You know once they become aware, then they, you know that's what critical consciousness says. That we move from this consciousness into action. So we've eliminated no we create these limit acts, so we become aware of what these limitations are that are externally driven, and then we move toward action. So, I mean that is the theory of critical consciousness. So I think we get out of the way and allow clients to do the work that they need to do. You know, what I was gonna add to the idea of, you know, neutrality, you know this myth of objectivity, is that it's very similar to the discussion going on in research. The idea of, of objectivity and neutrality in conducting research. But you know, similarly, a similar vein of people who're talking about different ways to conduct research, you know, what we call emancipatory research this idea that first of all, there is no objectivity. That every researcher has a position, and that their position needs to be revealed and included in what's going on, so you know that discussion's going on in research, then it certainly should be going on in counseling and psychotherapy. 

00:21:10
ALLEN IVEY And that's one of the things you need to do, just in terms of elementary practice. You need to be open to questions, to let the questions, let them question you, particularly if there's a gender difference, a secular orientation difference, a racial difference, there's a particularly important to put it on the table rather than leaving it the elephant that you never talk about. So that is, very much needs to bring out to the front. In terms of action, uh, I honestly, I see veterans, returning war veterans particularly important, culture move which we tend not to, but they went through the same process. They came back from, uh, Vietnam, uh, remember working in the VA, and my job was to find out who are the milingularies (ph), we didn't have the word post-traumatic stress. And as I began listening to these people, I said, hm, who's crazy? The person that sent this fellow to the hospital? No, it's, very, uh, I really, it's an incredible thing for me, moved me from my consciousness. Ah-hah, then, in terms of action, oh, I'm not sick, I've been dealing with this external situation I better stop this blaming. But uh, and the veterans got together like African Americans share this, and then APA, VES and Five, disorder. A logical response to insane situation is a disorder. And of course now, they're changing to post-traumatic stress reaction. Which I like the term better, but you know what, that means if they make it that they don't have the, there isn't as many benefits to the soldier. So it becomes an excuse. 

00:22:45
UNKNOWN So the multi-cultural counseling movement is really a push-back against the medical model, sounds like what you're talking about. You talked about some- 

00:22:55
ALLEN IVEY That's-, I don't wanna be enigmatic, there's lots of good medical stuff. But, and particularly keep in mind public health. Prevention, I took a course the best course I took at Stanford, my whole psych program, the best in the country, was an education in community community, community education. And I suddenly said, what's all going on? I followed this value in Denmark, you know, hey the Stanford Psychology department didn't get it. And for the most part they still don't. Brilliant though they are and great research, they still don't get social context. 

00:23:25
UNKNOWN So it sounds like what you're really talking about is the merging of the field of biology, psychology, and sociology. Counselors, psychologists, and therapists really need to operate from a bio-psycho-social perspective, uh, and be more balanced in, in uh, looking at clients from each of those three lenses and using all three disciplines to really understand clients. 

00:23:45
ALLEN IVEY See, and now uh, this long, I've become, the last six years very committed to neuroscience. And one of the reasons I got into neuroscience I began to discover that if the child is, goes through hunger, oppression, abuse, lives in Detroit, experiences multiple traumas, there's a loss of grey matter in the brain, which will stay there permanently. And thus, social justice becomes an important part of multicultural counseling, and I know there's a separate program on that, the part of action is to, one of the best things that happens, if you're working with a woman, or an African American, one of the best things you can do is encourage them to go out and help others become conscious. Women take back the night, African Americans become evolved in community change. Nothing healthier for a person in self-concept than helping somebody else. And that's a task of therapists, encourage help. And while we're doing this stuff, we ought to go active ourselves. 

00:24:40
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI So the idea of thinking about what kinds of interventions, that are being, uh, promoted within multicultural counseling, we think about this very integrated holistic approach of moving beyond the 50 minute sitting in session of being able to identify some pathology of thinking about more organic kinds of interventions, about using peer, uh, sponsored interventions. About intervening within one's system, and the more we do that, the more likely we are to be successful. In doing the work that we do. So we see a lot of work in which we're talking about traumatic stress. We haven't talked about that, and there's a whole body of literature that's about a decade old now and talking about traumatic stress. And it's really talking about um, looking at pervasive systemic acts of marginalization and oppression and the impact that it has on our system. And in a holistic way. So we know that it's not enough just to look at a psychological or the emotional, but also to take a look at the biological. But at the same time we're also looking at coping and human beings ability to cope and so there's a lot of literature that's beginning to talk about how our people, who should have either gone crazy, or be dead, how are they resilient- 

00:26:10
ALLEN IVEY Resiliency- 

00:26:10
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Resilient. Absolutely. And so we, as counselors, we need to use this, this body of knowledge, and advance it so that we begin to understand not only what's happening, to look at the phenomenon, but also to look at the exceptions to that, and to begin to question and be curious- 

00:26:30
ALLEN IVEY What are the strengths. 

00:26:30
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Exactly, exactly, and I think that that's you know part of the multicultural counseling movement. 

00:26:35
ALLEN IVEY And Cirecie I wanna go back to something you mentioned a couple times around, that's story and story-telling. What we're really doing in multicultural counseling, I think from one perspective and it's an accurate one too, is we take a story which isn't very effective, and we're working in restoring, we're changing the narrative. And so narrative therapy becomes particularly useful. But then you need relationship, and some of the Rogerian concepts of some of these, so, but I think the story-telling thing is particularly telling and important as a strategy, because, ability, basically the person has a story and then they begin to, a life meaning. Um, as a whole, and in that sense we draw from all different theories. But we are looking always at person in context. Considering oppression. 

00:27:25
UNKNOWN So you've talked about some pretty key concepts, uh, I hear you talking about counselors in psychologist and therapists need to understand clients in context of their environment. The notion of creating, helping to create critical consciousness. Looking at how issues of equity and oppression, are influencing mental health issues. Uh, as well as cultural identity of crosses, cultural identity development model. I'm wondering what are other key concepts that, uh, are important within the multi-cultural counseling place- 

00:28:00
ALLEN IVEY I could take a first shot at that if you don't mind. And that is basically the multicultural competencies. And they provide a map of the k-, the key concepts. And I think that they really need to be, I'd like to say the core of the total counseling curriculum. Uh, I was lucky enough to be present at the counseling psychology in APA in 1980. And my, one thing I most proud of is I named Daryl Ringsue (ph) the head of the committee, his committee report was the multicultural competence. The first edition, and 1980 to 2002, a lot of people, couple hundred actually, go involved before those were implemented. And I think this awareness of yourself, awareness of the issues, the knowledge of what the things are, and then developing the skills, and then you get into the fine points of that. Provide a very good framework for the concepts I've been talking about, how would you take that? 

00:28:55
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI I would agree, really. I think that as we move forward, one of the challenges that we've had is merging practice with the theory. So, you know one of the things that you know I constantly, uh, talk to my students about in classes is that, um, often times we don't really know what to do when we get in our offices and close the door. So we have an intellectual understanding of awareness, knowledge, and skills, but we don't really know what to do differently. And part of that is because we haven't really provided, uh, a lot of demonstrations of what does that look like? And that involves practitioners. So it's very important for us as scholars to partner with practitioners, people who are doing the work day in day out, who, for the most part aren't writing these articles, aren't writing these books. But are in there doing the work. And I think they can tell us the nuances of what it's like to try to use culture centered techniques in helping people to move from disconsciouness to consciousness. So I think, as, as we think about what has provided the foundation for the work that we do, that we still need to articulate what does that look like in our offices when no one else is looking do we really understand how to enact multicultural competence. Uh, in working with our client. So, we really do need to find ways to demonstrate that one of the things that I've been doing is creating a lot of immersion experiences for students. And I do those locally as well as internationally. Uh, to be able to help them to see what it looks like. So, uh, I think about the trip that we took in 2007, and uh, we went to South Africa and Botswana. And in the suburbs of Johannesburg, we were providing professional development with outreach workers. And they were showing us what culture centered interventions looked like. And the students lear-, gained a tremendous amount of, of knowledge about the interventions. About how do you dance an intervention? So how do you use non-talk therapy to move people along expediently with very little recidivism (ph). So how do we access that in a way that really helps people, so, it's important for us to go into environments where we are confronted with these other ways in which we can intervene with our clients, and to learn how to do that so people need to first be told how to do it, and then get a demonstration of how it's done, and then have the opportunity to practice that with support. So I think that we need to begin to move forward with our understanding of the competencies and learn how to practice it, and I think that's where we are today, of really doing it. And, Patricia Arignondo (ph) has done that in talking about the Latino-centric competencies. And the work that she's doing, she's partnering with practitioners. And she's writing books that give examples. So, uh, a recent graduate, or even an experienced practitioner can open up, uh, that material, those resources, and see an intervention that is uniquely culture-centered. Not an adaptation of a Western-oriented intervention. But one that draws from the world views of those people and think about using it with a client in their own context. 

00:32:40
ALLEN IVEY And, another type of intervention, getting into neuroscience, I'm really looking at the research, and by the way the best research currently being done in the medical, not in the psychological literature. And that is stress management. And, for example, uh, an African American has hypertension, we can give them meds or you can work with them on exercise, meditation, social relationships, sleep patterns. All of these things stress management. Uh, there's multiculturalism, stress management, multicultural competencies. And it's all you need for effective practice. But stress management is undersold. Uh, stress management will produce all the more grey matter in the brain, uh, that, African Americans who've, are facing Alzheimer's that exercise will slow down the progress of Alzheimer's, neuro, and that's functional magnetic resonance imaging. This is science. We now have a science to validate multicultural counseling. And every-, alm-, many, many times I'll find wonderful multi-cultural stuff in medical literature. More effective than our own work. 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN So it sounds like the fields really evolved from a theoretical abstract concept with the multicultural counseling competencies, which is really about how the world should be, how therapists should operate, uh, looking at the practicalities of that-, how do you operationalize the competencies. How do you, as a therapist, bridge a gap between theory and practice, which is really what you've been involved with. Uh, um, in the field. And I like what you talked about, earlier, which is not taking what a theory that already exists, and adapting it, to a different population, but creating something completely different. Uh, moving beyond that, that additive approach to helping where we take a theory, tweak it, but the core constructs of that theory sort of are the same. That's, what you're saying is do something-, what both of you are saying is do something completely different, which is meeting clients where they're at, essentially. Versus having clients adapt to our way of knowing, our way of practicing. 

00:35:00
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Yes, I would say that, you know when I first graduated, and became licensed, that, uh, as long as my clients were white males, I was good to go. So I spent weeks getting my clients to learn how to be a good client. Uh, vi-sa-vi what I had learned in my textbooks. And over time my clients taught me to meet them where they are. So they taught me how to be a more effective counselor. But you know, when I started, yeah, I, until they were on board with being a white male client, I-, I couldn't do anything, because I didn't understand them. I didn't understand what they were doing. So they had to follow me down that path, um, in order for them to, to receive some assistance. But over time, as I got better, I opened myself up to be vulnerable to that. To receive them. And they taught me a lot. So whether that client was, uh, you know, um, a middle-aged white female, who was struggling with maturing into a place where she's comfortable with how her life has evolved. Whether it's working with, uh, a retiring priest, who, is look-, searching for meaning, and context, uh, moving into that. Whether it's working with a client who has experienced some kind of sexual trauma, and is a 23 year old female. College student. Whatever kind of client that was, that I decided what I need to do is find out who are they, and what does help or healing look like in their own context. And once I went there I was much more expedient. I was much more respectful. And I was transformed. So I grew as a person and a professional. 

00:36:55
UNKNOWN Sounds like for counselors they'd really need to be at a certain level to be able to critique themselves in a way. I'm wondering, kinda wanna switch gears a little bit. What are the benefits for counselors? 

00:37:05
ALLEN IVEY A, rea-, reality is the word that comes out of my mind, that's the benefit. It's just the way the world is, let's face it and deal with it. And it's a world of interconnections, it's a world of difference, and let's start facing reality. I think that's what it has to, has to be faced. And, uh, and that's what it's done for me. The thing is, I never stopped learning. I think I've come to the top of the mountain, nope, another mountain top to go! There was always something new for me to learn. Always something, and it's exciting. As you can tell. For me. It's reality, I think is what it is. 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN What's the challenge in operating from this paradigm? What challenges can counselors expect? 

00:37:50
ALLEN IVEY Well, I think maybe, I, I think about also a wonderful, uh, Columbian graduate student I had, she was an internship. This is an example of a challenging thing to have, uh, a woman came, uh, into her, in the clinic in Boston. Who was being abused and had no place to go that night. Also went out and found a place for her to stay. She came back, her supervisor berating her for being unprofessional. And that's a really great challenge is you have, and I think another great challenge is the huge monolith that says this is the way you shall do it. Another great challenge is DSM and worse, is DSM 5. And, by the way, NIMH is planning a brain-based system which for diagnosis would be both bio-social, so they're gonna look at, the new model would be looking at developmental history as well as biological issues. And also that new model coming up probably in 10 15 years, and has specific treatment. DSM 5 slows down, wastes money, and gets in the way. So, that, one of the great challenges is just the existing system. And then challenges of racism, sexism, uh, and the way to understand the disabled, go down that whole list of 'isms', they're still there. 

00:39:20
UNKNOWN As you talk about that, that just seems overwhelming for- 

00:39:20
ALLEN IVEY Yes. 

00:39:20
UNKNOWN So, how do you, what recommendations do you have to, as, especially for emerging counselors and therapists who really resonate with a multicultural movement and perspective if you will. In terms of, uh, what recommendations do you have in terms of, you know, to not get burned out? Cause I would imagine, uh, and not to get overwhelmed, cause I would imagine what you're describing is a very, can be very overwhelming. 

00:39:50
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Well, you know, there are a lot of metaphors that can help people who are just getting started. You know one is the starfish story, you know to understand that um, you know this, the idea of a man walking along on the beach, and, uh, is throwing the star, picking up the starfish and throwing him back into the ocean. And someone comes along and says what are you doing? He says I'm throwing starfish back into the ocean. And the person said, do you know how many starfish are on this beach? You know, it's like, it's an impossible task. It's not gonna make a difference. And the man looks and throws another starfish in, and says, it matters to that one. So the idea is that we have to deal with it one piece at a time, and not be overwhelmed by the, the the huge task, but deal with it at this micro-level, to say it'll matter with this client right here. It'll matter today. Now can I account for tomorrow? But it will matter today. So I think that it's important to do that, I think one of the challenges that I would add to that is just our own growth. Uh, about being honest. And being authentic and coming to the table and being vulnerable. So I think that when we don't admit things to ourselves, when we understand that sometimes we can be the obstacle to change, that, uh, we can impede the progress. So, uh, you know I'd like to talk about that as well, and I think we never reach this level where we're so competent multi-culturally that we we don't have those challenges with our clients. It doesn't matter what you know about the field, that a client, each client brings a different challenge, and sometimes that challenge is related to our own growth and development. So I think that in, in being multiculturally competent, that sometimes the challenge is us, and the work that we have to do with ourselves and that never ends, so we can never be a card-carrying, multi-culturally competent counselor and, you know when someone challenges us on what we're saying we just pull out our card and say, well you can't challenge me on that, because see, I'm a multiculturally competent counselor. That's not true, and often times, people will do that. They'll take a multicultural counseling course or they'll be with a particular scholar, that's another thing, and say well, you know I studied under, you know, so, but we never reach that end. We are always challenged. And we can never feel that, uh, that that we've arrived at some point. So I think we're, we are the challenge. Sometimes, and that we need to do that work. So it's important for us to include that in the mix. 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN Cause what you're saying is it starts with us. It's a life-long process, it requires a lot of self-awareness. Awareness of external factors as, as well, um. It requires us to be vulnerable and okay with being uncomfortable, and asking that question. Talking about the elephant in the room. Um, that can impede on the therapeutic relationship. That can contribute to that barrier. 

00:43:05
ALLEN IVEY I would wanna, really reinforce the, the starfish example. Don't expect to do it all, uh, it's not the mistakes you make, it's the way you recover from mistakes, and learn from them. Uh, you've also- 

00:43:15
UNKNOWN And being okay with, not being perfect. 

00:43:20
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, cause you, it's, it, it's too complex, uh, I've been in this stuff um, did my first writing literally 46 years ago. The multicultural counseling before most of the people out there were born. And yet, there's always something new and someplace else I find I've done wrong. And there's always something to learn. Uh, though there's the other piece, about we're striving, is the whole issue of burnout which you mentioned, and you gotta take care of yourself. That, this week, course I always talk about the latest study I read, but, this week I read a study about brain scans of physicians. And they had, uh, patients, and physicians. And they had videotapes of pa-, uh, a patient experiencing pain, and, uh, a patient not experiencing pain. Uh, vast difference between, the control, subjects that were patients, they could, they, the brains heightened up, the scan all lightened up. Physi-, uh, physicians did what they call de-regulated. And they were not impacted by that. Which basically means it's most good and bad. It's good because if you see enough pain, you've gotta distance yourself. But if you distance yourself too further, too far, and we've all seen physicians that are really good at de-regulating their observation of pain. That they lose the empathy. And so there's that incredibly important balance, is the most important to care. And when you sense yourself de-regulating, uh, then at this time you step back and take a break, get supervision, find yourself. Because you're only going to do damage if you're too de-regulated. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN So I wanna talk about future developments. Um, where do you see the multicultural counseling movement going in the future? Where is it headed? 

00:45:10
ALLEN IVEY I think the first thing we see is it's just awesome. How it now is more and more predominating in literature. And, uh, I can recall when I knew all the literature. Literally I knew all the literature. Oh, by the way I can remember when there wasn't any. And I knew all the literature and knew different journals, and suddenly, there's so many journals, so much going on, so much good stuff, and I think you made a really good point when you sa-, pointed out, it really and you have too, we were moving much more interdisciplinary issues, anthropology, this, sociology, and yet we still remain counselors and there's that core, but to know what we're doing demands incredible, knowledge. And I think where we're going to go is a more broader awareness. The bio-social, standards have changed, the more bio-social model. Uh, developmental model, these things, this is, developmental model in particularly, uh, I think we need to pay a lot more attention in stress management, I think uh, the issue of uh, signing up programs with them, I think these things are all in development. And the research we're seeing constantly, just in new, new counseling psychologists, uh, came out, in the new AMCD journal. Full of new, new good things. Where there wasn't anything, it just amazing, this stuff's just going to become more and more essential. 

00:46:40
UNKNOWN It's really evolved to a point where the multicultural perspective is, is core to what we do as counselors, core into our training programs. It's, it's in the code of ethics, it's part of the requirements, uh, multicultural counseling, sounds like, has, has had a major influence in terms of shifting the field. 

00:47:05
ALLEN IVEY You know I think, how vastly it's changed, I remember when Michael Leadrea (ph), Patricia Arendondo (ph), I think Daryle Lingsu (ph), Tom Spar (ph) and I were ready to picket at an ASIS meeting because they wouldn't deal with the multicultural compass, we literally were starting to break up the conference unless they did something, uh, and that was only about 15, 20 years ago. So we can see how much things have changed in a fairly short time. 

00:47:30
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI And has given birth to that kind of change in other disciplines. 

00:47:35
ALLEN IVEY I guess one of the things is advocacy and getting in peoples' face now and then. Taking a risk. 

00:47:40
UNKNOWN It's helped spurn the social justice movements, in a sense. 

00:47:45
ALLEN IVEY Yes. Yeah, the social justice movement came out of the counseling is not enough. 

00:47:50
CIRECIE WEST-OLATUNJI Absolutely. I would add one other piece that, uh, seems to be on the horizon. And that is the integration of multicultural counseling with sort of this international counseling movement. So as we, we see an emergence of, of counseling in other countries, and people asking for assistance in consultation from the American Counseling Association, and other counseling organizations, uh, as more multicultural counseling people become involved in that, they bring with them that expertise, and so with an exchange, with a true dialogue, what we're going to get is new kinds of definitions, new terms, as people in other contexts talk about what counseling looks like there. So, uh, you know one of the things I've heard Cortney Lee (ph) talk about is that once we really being a true conversation globally about counseling, and we're actually learning from other people, that what we do might not be the word counseling. That it might be some other word that more fully expresses the kinds of things that we do. And so we need to open ourselves up to a true global conversation about what healing looks like in all these different places so we don't need to be the, you know the true core of what counseling is. People have been resolving their problems for centuries well before Freud came along, and provided us with our foundation in counseling and psychotherapy. So as we begin to be more tolerant, and open ourselves up to conversations with people in the Pacific Rim, with people in on the continent of Africa, people in Eastern and Western Europe and people in uh, the Americas, outside of the US, that what we'll get are other definitions, we'll, we'll get these other things and so it'll become more diverse, we'll have a better understanding, and we might learn something, actually, about how this work is done. So I would say that that's also on the horizon. That there is, uh, very much the potential to be able to integrate multicultural counseling as a movement in a global context. I think we need to be a part of that conversation. Uh, and I'm hoping that in, in my role in counseling that I actually can insert us, very intentionally, so that that can happen. 

00:50:30
ALLEN IVEY I'm very thrilled to hear you talk about a conversation, uh, predominance in my work now is international. And a good fair number of people internationally that see the US counselors coming over as imperialists. Uh, suspect everything they suspect the CIA and so forth, to come in, here's our answer, uh, too many of us Americans have that attitude, and your, your conversation really shift, I think there's too much of the, we're gonna fix you, and uh, there's some places they don't want us anymore. So the conversation you're talking about, I'm delighted to hear you the, new emphasis, I can't tell you how, I can't tell you how pleased I am. I think that is so important. And back, we're basically back to a new story, we go over as a naive, ugly American, and let's have a conversation, what can we learn? And we can learn an awful lot. Cause, in fact our whole multicultural movement, what's going on in South Africa, affects us here. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN We become, sounds like a, sort of expanded to become more global. In a sense. Dr. West-Olatunji, Dr. Ivy, I wanna thank you for this time and giving me an opportunity to talk with you a little bit more multiculturalism as the fourth force in counseling. I know I've learned a lot, and hopefully the viewers have as well. Thank you.
