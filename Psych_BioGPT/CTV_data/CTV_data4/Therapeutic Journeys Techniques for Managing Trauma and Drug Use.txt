Motivational interviewing 

00:00:00
Getting started 

00:00:20
DR. ALI MARSH So, Julia, you've told me um, a bit about your drug use. You said that you're using speed, hash, and pills kind of pretty much every day at the moment. Um. 

00:00:30
JULIA Mm-hmm, and alcohol. 

00:00:30
DR. ALI MARSH Oh, and alcohol, yeah. When you can't get the others? 

00:00:35
JULIA Yeah, when it's all just chard I'll just go and get a bottle of Vodka or Gin. Or something just to sort of, yeah, just to go and try to deal with whatever's going on. 

00:00:50
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:00:50
JULIA Just to slow it all down. 

00:00:50
DR. ALI MARSH To slow it down, okay. 

00:00:50
JULIA Yeah. 

00:00:50
DR. ALI MARSH And so, you know, you're, you're here because you're kind of worried about all this, this drug use. And I know that you've said that you've, you've tried before and you've had lots of goes at trying to stop and you just find it really, really difficult. 

00:01:05
JULIA Mmm, mmm. 

00:01:05
DR. ALI MARSH And so, then. 

00:01:05
JULIA I mean, I've been, I've been to, to, I've been to rehabs and I've been to, I've even stayed home and tried to sort of just locked myself in the house and, and detox. And I've gone to, you know, I mean, you know, no offense but, you know, I've gone to lots of counselors in the past and it just hasn't. 

00:01:25
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

00:01:30
JULIA Worked. So, I'm really, I'm sort of really, yeah, I'm really desparate now. 

00:01:35
DR. ALI MARSH So you're feeling really desparate. 

00:01:35
JULIA Mmm. 

00:01:35
DR. ALI MARSH But kind of like, it hasn't worked before so you're, you're, you're kind of uh, is this gonna work. 

00:01:40
JULIA Yeah. 

00:01:40
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:01:40
JULIA Yeah, maybe it's just me. Yeah, I think there's a part of me that just says I'm useless. I can't do it. I'm, I'm maybe I'm just uh, maybe it's just uh. 

00:01:50
DR. ALI MARSH Okay, so you start to, to think that it's sort of you. 

00:01:55
JULIA Mmm. 

00:01:55
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. You know, when, when people use drugs like that and had lots of goes at trying to stop. And you mentioned a couple of things about, you know, you know, sort of like using them because, you know, that, that sort of coping I guess. 

00:02:10
JULIA Mmm. 

00:02:10
DR. ALI MARSH Um, I mean it sounds to me as if the drugs are probably doing a lot of things for you. A lot of really kind of important things for you and that's why, why it's so hard to stop. 

00:02:20
JULIA What do you, what do you? 

00:02:20
DR. ALI MARSH Well, I'm just wondering if you could have a think about, you know, what is it that keeps you using. What do the drugs do for you? How do they help. 

00:02:25
Motivational interviewing 

00:02:30
JULIA I just, I can't, I just can't function without out them, like. 

00:02:35
DR. ALI MARSH All right. 

00:02:35
JULIA Um, every time I've tried to stop, it just, I feel like I'm going to have a break down. Like it's, well I have, I have had like nervous breakdowns. I can't breathe. And I think um, someone keep saying to me, it's you know, they were saying to me before it was panic, or like panic attack. 

00:02:55
DR. ALI MARSH So, so, what happens you feel like can't breathe? 

00:02:55
JULIA Yeah. 

00:02:55
DR. ALI MARSH What else happens? 

00:03:00
JULIA I feel like I'm going to die. I've tried then, you know, to go to the doctors. And sort of, they say we're just going to give you some benzos, but it just doesn't, it just doesn't do it, just doesn't do it. 

00:03:10
DR. ALI MARSH Doesn't do it. So when you're not using you, you feel panicky um, you feel you can't kind of cope? 

00:03:15
JULIA Yeah. 

00:03:15
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

00:03:15
JULIA Right, everything's just coming in on me. I can't think clearly. 

00:03:25
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:03:25
JULIA And um, yeah. 

00:03:30
DR. ALI MARSH Right. 

00:03:30
JULIA It's, it's just really hard to explain but it's like I said, it's like a nervous breakdown. 

00:03:35
DR. ALI MARSH So you feel like you're having a nervous breakdown when you're not using. 

00:03:40
JULIA Yep. 

00:03:40
DR. ALI MARSH And does that apply to, to all the different drugs or is it, do the different drugs kind of do different things? 

00:03:45
JULIA Um, well, the speed, you know, I try as much as possible not to use speed because you know, that's, that's sort of more difficult to get and it's a bit more expensive. And when I haven't got any money, what I have to do to get it, everything's just, so that's really hard. But there're time when I just can't drag myself out of bed. 

00:04:05
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:04:10
JULIA And that, that gives me the energy to be out. And there's times when I'm like, I just, I can't be around people. 

00:04:15
DR. ALI MARSH Mm-hmm. 

00:04:15
JULIA Like I just find it hard to be around people but if I got speed then I, I can. 

00:04:20
DR. ALI MARSH Okay, so the speed gives you energy and helps you be around people. 

00:04:25
JULIA Yeah. 

00:04:25
DR. ALI MARSH And you've also, and the other drug, the um, the pills, and the pot and the alcohol. 

00:04:30
JULIA Well, I have pot every night to hel p me go to sleep. 

00:04:35
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

00:04:35
JULIA Um, and then the pills, often there's nights I can't sleep and the pots not enough because my head's just spinning. Particular if I've had an argument with my boyfriend or something's going on at work, or someone's let you down again. And you just need some sleep and, and so I take the pills then. 

00:04:55
DR. ALI MARSH Sure. 

00:05:00
JULIA Um, and yeah, that, that's, that just helps me to just block out. 

00:05:05
DR. ALI MARSH Okay, so they help you to block out. 

00:05:05
JULIA Yeah. 

00:05:05
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:05:10
JULIA Stop all that. 

00:05:10
DR. ALI MARSH Stop all? 

00:05:10
JULIA Stop all the noise in my head. 

00:05:10
DR. ALI MARSH Stop all the noise in your head. 

00:05:10
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:05:10
DR. ALI MARSH And is there anything else the drugs do for you, any of them? 

00:05:15
JULIA Well, it's um, when I was, when I was younger and, and still sometimes now when things get really, really bad I, um, uh, it's uh, I don't like this. But I cut or burn. 

00:05:40
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:05:40
JULIA Myself and I don't know that sounds really, really weird. But. 

00:05:45
Reframing coping strategies 

00:05:45
DR. ALI MARSH No. It's not so, it's not so weird. I, I work with a lot of people who do that. 

00:05:50
JULIA Well, it, it like makes me feel better but. 

00:05:55
DR. ALI MARSH It something. 

00:05:55
JULIA Sometimes I really feel like I'm really, really trying not to do that, and so sometimes when I'm really in that space where I00:06:05] want to get the, get the cigarette lighter and burn myself or, or cut myself with, with a little pocket knife sort of thing. Then I'll, I'll use instead. 

00:06:15
DR. ALI MARSH You'll use instead. So, it helps you not to. 

00:06:20
JULIA Yeah. 

00:06:20
DR. ALI MARSH Not to sort of hurt yourself and to kind of. 

00:06:20
JULIA I'm really embarrassed about it. 

00:06:25
DR. ALI MARSH And, and is that all. And is the cutting and the burning it sounds like that's also about just coping emotionally and. 

00:06:30
JULIA Yeah, I know it sounds really, really weird but from a really. I've always, like I, I do much less now. I did it lots. 

00:06:40
DR. ALI MARSH It's okay. 

00:06:40
JULIA When I was um, younger and I use to do it with people.[00:0645] And I couldn't see it. But then that's when I started taking drugs. And there's times I find that when I'm then using that I, I don't understand. 

00:06:55
DR. ALI MARSH How bad it is. 

00:06:55
JULIA I don't understand it but that sometimes I end up doing that more. 

00:07:00
DR. ALI MARSH Sure. 

00:07:00
JULIA So, it's like which is. 

00:07:00
DR. ALI MARSH Mmm, so it sounds like, it sounds like they're both ways. 

00:07:00
JULIA Mmm. 

00:07:00
DR. ALI MARSH Of managing your emotions and making yourself feel less or fell better. 

00:07:10
JULIA I don't, I don't, yeah basically it's just about me feeling like I can cope. Yeah. 

00:07:10
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. Cope and I know that you say it sounds weird and that you feel kind of um, you know, uncomfortable about telling me about it. 

00:07:20
JULIA Mmm. 

00:07:20
DR. ALI MARSH But it's actually a, a common thing that people do when they, when they've got really intense emotions. And they've had um, you know, some horrible things happen to them. It's, it's sort of a way of coping. So people do that. 

00:07:35
JULIA Okay. 

00:07:35
DR. ALI MARSH And so, I mean, I think it's, it's in some ways similar to the drug use in that you're using it for pretty similar reasons. Does it feel like that to you? 

00:07:45
JULIA Um, it yeah. It does. It feels like I got to do either one or the other. 

00:07:50
DR. ALI MARSH The other. Sure. 

00:07:50
JULIA Yeah. 

00:07:50
DR. ALI MARSH And you know later on, as we continue counseling we'll look at some other ways in which you can manage your emotions. So that it will be easier for you not to do those things. 

00:08:00
JULIA Okay. 

00:08:00
DR. ALI MARSH And but we'll do that later on. 

00:08:05
JULIA Because that's the, that's the thing every time, you know I've gone on try to do this. It's like then I'm just left like with. 

00:08:10
DR. ALI MARSH With nothing. 

00:08:10
JULIA Nothing, I don't know what to do. 

00:08:15
DR. ALI MARSH And it's so important that you have other ways of managing and that's going to be a really important part of our counseling. Helping you to manage in other ways. I mean it makes complete sense that you really struggle to stop, to stop using and to stop, you know, hurting yourself if you haven't been able to find other ways to manage. And so that is going to be something very important that we do. 

00:08:35
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:08:40
DR. ALI MARSH As we go along. 

00:08:40
JULIA Yeah. Because otherwise you just feel useless. You feel like you failed again. 

00:08:45
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

00:08:45
JULIA Yeah. 

00:08:45
DR. ALI MARSH But I guess it's also, it's also important for you to, to, you know, think about what you just told me now. That drug use has been doing some very, very important things for you. And um, and so, you know, it's not, it's not that easy for you to stop. And you're doing other things. Okay. Now, is it okay, if we just move on now and look at the other side of it. We've looked at the, the things that it does for you, the good things. 

00:09:10
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:09:15
DR. ALI MARSH What's the, you know, the sort of the down side of it? What are the difficulties. 

00:09:20
JULIA Ah, I'm just really tired of it. 

00:09:20
DR. ALI MARSH You're really tired of it. And you look really distressed as you say that. 

00:09:25
JULIA Yeah, I just can't. 

00:09:30
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

00:09:30
JULIA I can't keep it up. You know, it's just to hard, hard having it in your head all the time. When I'm I going to get the next one. Which doctor's going to give me some pills and in a way it's easy, you know, that's fine. But it's like the speed what do I have to do in order to get the money. And then you feel really terrible in the end. And it's just, I just feel like such a bad person. I should be able to just. I, I know it's not good, why can't I just, why can't I just grow up and just stop it. It's, it's so, it's just, it's just, I can't even have another life. It's just all, all consuming. 

00:10:15
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. So it'[s00:10:20] really, really worrying you. 

00:10:15
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:10:15
DR. ALI MARSH It's um, it's always in your head. And you're always worrying where can you get the money from. 

00:10:25
JULIA Yeah. 

00:10:25
DR. ALI MARSH And you don't like the things that you're doing to get the money and you feel like a bad person. 

00:10:30
JULIA Yeah. 

00:10:30
DR. ALI MARSH And that just feels so distressing for you. 

00:10:35
JULIA Yep. 

00:10:35
DR. ALI MARSH Did you want to say anything more about any of that now, or is that kind of enough for now. 

00:10:40
JULIA It's probably, yeah, too. 

00:10:40
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah, Okay. 

00:10:40
JULIA It's too, it's too. 

00:10:45
DR. ALI MARSH Hard. 

00:10:45
JULIA It's too hard. I just feel under, it's just so hard. And I fell so ashame, I'm so ashamed. I'm really ashamed of it. 

00:10:50
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. So really hard to talk about too. And you're really worried that if, about what's going on. And if you do keep using, what are you concerned about, the future as well? Is it not just the present. 

00:11:05
JULIA It's just going to be, I mean, you know, well there's times when I just. I mean I'm not at the moment, so you know, it's okay but there's times when I've just have, I've just tried to take my life, you know. This is not worth it. Like why, I don't want to be here if this is what it is. 

00:11:25
DR. ALI MARSH You don't want to go on. 

00:11:25
JULIA You know, like all the time, when I'm working and I look at all these really normal people and they come in and, you know, you see their families and you see their kids. And I just feel like. 

00:11:35
DR. ALI MARSH You want what they got. Yeah. Okay. And you see the drug use as not allowing you to have that? 

00:11:45
JULIA Well, you know, I'll just end up loose a boyfriend, so 

00:11:50
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

00:11:50
JULIA Loose my jobs and um, I've got no one to support me. Your friends let you down. 

00:12:00
DR. ALI MARSH Sure. Okay. So, Julia, I mean things that like the drug use does a lot of real important things for you. You've talked about them. It calms you down, it helps you to not have panic attacks, it helps you feel as though you're not having a break down. It helps you to not cut and burn yourself and it can also help you to kind of get going when you need to do something and you're feeling really, really sort of not really good and it can give you energy. And then the other side of it is that it's really distressing you. 

00:12:30
JULIA Hmm. 

00:12:30
Summary of less good aspects of drug use 

00:12:30
DR. ALI MARSH And what's happening because it weighs on you mind and, and you know, you always have to find the money and you've got to do things to find the money. And it stops you from having. 

00:12:35
JULIA I feel useless. 

00:12:40
DR. ALI MARSH And it makes you feel useless and it stops you from having a life you need. 

00:12:40
JULIA Yeah. 

00:12:45
DR. ALI MARSH And so, so, I mean it, the drug use is kind of important to you at the moment. But also all the difficulties are important to you. 

00:12:55
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:12:55
DR. ALI MARSH And from what you're saying it's sounds like you're really, really desparate to, to really try and kind of. 

00:13:00
JULIA Yeah, I really, really want to try. 

00:13:00
DR. ALI MARSH You really want to try and give it up. 

00:13:05
JULIA Yep. 

00:13:05
DR. ALI MARSH I see. 

00:13:05
JULIA 'Cuz I'm losing, I'm losing a lot of hope. 

00:13:05
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

00:13:05
JULIA That it's gonna be any different. I don't want live life. 

00:13:10
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:13:10
JULIA It's not worth living. So I'm really, really. 

00:13:15
DR. ALI MARSH So, it's really important to you. 

00:13:15
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:13:15
DR. ALI MARSH To, to kind of like be able to change your drug use. 

00:13:20
JULIA Yeah. 

00:13:20
DR. ALI MARSH And get on with life. And at the same time what I'm hearing is maybe, you know, you don't know quite how to. Like is there, are you confident about it? 

00:13:30
JULIA No, no. As I said, I've tried so many times and it just hasn't hasn't worked. Hasn't worked, so you know, I'm not really that. 

00:13:40
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:13:40
JULIA I'm not, I'm not really convinced that I can do it. 

00:13:45
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:13:45
JULIA I mean I'm pretty, you know, I haven't really succeeded in anything. So, you know, thinking I'm gonna be able to do this is. 

00:13:55
DR. ALI MARSH Okay, so you're pretty. 

00:13:55
JULIA Is pretty, pretty. 

00:13:55
DR. ALI MARSH Okay, so you're feeling pretty kind of wobbly about it. Not terribly confident. 

00:14:00
JULIA No. 

00:14:00
Rationale for introducing emotion management 

00:14:00
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. So, one of the, um, one thing as I mentioned earlier that's going to be very important for us to do is to help you to find other ways to cope with what's going on. And as you've talked and one of the things that I really picked up is that emotions are pretty, are a bit of difficult area for you. You feel overwhelmed. Uh, some of the time. You, you don't, you, you sort of feel like, like you can't cope with things. Life's a bit difficult. You, you feel bad about yourself most of the time. Those sorts of things. 

00:14:35
JULIA Mmm, mmm. 

00:14:40
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. Okay. So, some of the thing, and they're some of the things that the drug use helps with. And you talked about having panic attacks. So, you know, having all of that, that anxiety all the time. 

00:14:50
JULIA Feeling like I'm going to die. 

00:14:50
DR. ALI MARSH Feeling like you're going to die. So, one of the things that I think we could, that we should be doing together is helping you to find ways to manage your emotions that don't involve. 

00:15:00
JULIA Don't know when you say emotions? 

00:15:05
DR. ALI MARSH You don't really know what that means. Okay. Ways to manage kind of how you're feeling. Sometimes it might just be a physical feeling. 

00:15:10
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:15:10
DR. ALI MARSH Sometimes it might be, you know, feeling angry. Do you ever feel angry? 

00:15:20
JULIA Mmm, mmm. 

00:15:20
DR. ALI MARSH So that's an emotion. 

00:15:20
JULIA Okay. 

00:15:20
DR. ALI MARSH And sometimes it might be feeling just really stressed out. 

00:15:25
JULIA Yeah. 

00:15:25
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

00:15:25
JULIA Yep. 

00:15:25
DR. ALI MARSH And sometimes it might be feeling overwhelmed. 

00:15:30
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:15:30
DR. ALI MARSH So all those sorts of things they were all emotions. And so, they were all feelings. 

00:15:35
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:15:35
DR. ALI MARSH And so, what, what I'd like to do is just explore with you as we go along, just various different ways in which you can uh, manage your emotions. So we might do, we'll do some little exercises around breathing and um, being aware of what's going on in your emotions and around being in the present. All sorts of things like that. Does that sound okay, for you? To give those things a go. We'll do them one at a time and. 

00:16:05
JULIA I'll give it a go. 

00:16:05
DR. ALI MARSH I'll explain them. 

00:16:05
JULIA Yeah. 

00:16:05
DR. ALI MARSH But does it sound like something that, that, that might be something you'd be prepared to try? 

00:16:10
JULIA Yeah. I'll, I'll definitely give it a go. 

00:16:15
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. That'll be part of what we're doing. We'll be doing other things too of course. Looking at what's going on in your life and, and you know, other things that you, other ways to cope with them. But this, this sort of emotions, feelings side of things they help you get some more control over that. Might be really helpful for you. 

00:16:30
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:16:35
[music] 

00:16:35
Dealing with dissociation and stress reduction techniques 

00:16:35
Exploring family history 

00:16:35
DR. ALI MARSH Julia, we talked a fair bit about what's going for you at the moment about your drug use and your boyfriend, and um, how desparate you're feeling and all the rest of it. Now, what I'd like to do to get some understanding how all this came to be, is get a sense of how it fits into your life. And so as part of that I'd like to get a sense of kind of what, you know, what growing up was like for you. 

00:17:05
JULIA Ugg. 

00:17:05
DR. ALI MARSH What you're family was like? 

00:17:10
JULIA Shit. 

00:17:10
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah, you're able to tell me a little bit more about that? 

00:17:15
JULIA Um, uh, where do I. 

00:17:15
DR. ALI MARSH It's looking pretty difficult for you. 

00:17:15
JULIA Uh, where do I start. 

00:17:25
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

00:17:25
JULIA Uh, Mum was absolutely hopeless. 

00:17:25
DR. ALI MARSH Mm-hmm. Can you tell me a little bit more about that? 

00:17:30
JULIA Um, well, she still is pretty hopeless. Um, huh, I've tried so many times to cut her out of my life and somehow I end up going back. But, um, she's, she's an alcoholic. 

00:17:50
DR. ALI MARSH Mmm. 

00:17:50
JULIA So, um, yeah, she's always, she was always drunk and. 

00:17:55
DR. ALI MARSH So this was when you were little she was always drunk? 

00:18:00
JULIA Yeah. 

00:18:00
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:18:00
JULIA Yeah. 

00:18:00
DR. ALI MARSH Mmm. And so that was pretty difficult for you? And what, what was she like when she was drunk? 

00:18:10
JULIA Ah. 

00:18:10
DR. ALI MARSH A nice drunk or is she just passed out or she'd get angry? 

00:18:15
JULIA No. She used to yell and scream and um, I was huh, it was, it was so frigh-, I was so, it was so frightening. Like I'm trying to help her and I try and say Mum, you know, it's okay and I'm really sorry. I'm really sorry I've been, I can't um, uh, I'm sorry I've been naughty. I, you know, it's so hard. 

00:18:40
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:18:45
JULIA And I could never do anything to make her happy. 

00:18:45
DR. ALI MARSH So, so you used to try and try and nothing worked. 

00:18:50
JULIA It still doesn't. 

00:18:50
DR. ALI MARSH It still doesn't work. And that's just so distressing for you isn't it? And so it was like this all your life from when you were very little? 

00:19:00
JULIA As long as I can remember. 

00:19:05
DR. ALI MARSH As long as you can remember. And so, and so Mum was often drunk and she wasn't sort of there for you because she was drunk. And where. 

00:19:20
JULIA I'd have to get myself up to go to school because she used to be in bed hangover and. 

00:19:25
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:19:30
JULIA So, yeah. I'd get myself up and go to school and then I'd, you know, at school I'd have to try an put on the happy face because I didn't, you know, it was really embarrassing. So I didn't want the other kids to know and I could never have kids coming over or stay. I was never allowed to go and stay at other people's places. So, I was just never, yeah, I couldn't wait, I couldn't wait. And then when I was about, uh, I think about 14 or 15 I just, I just got out of there, I just. I couldn't. 

00:20:05
DR. ALI MARSH So you, so things were that bad that you just got out when you were that young. 

00:20:10
JULIA Well, they were, yeah. Yeah, but there were times when um, I don't know, that welfare. 

00:20:15
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:20:15
JULIA Would come and, and that was just like a, you know, that was awful, like they'd take me away and I'd have to go and live in, you know, um, um, total strangers. Don't start me about foster care. 

00:20:35
DR. ALI MARSH Okay, you sound pretty angry about the foster care, pretty distressed. 

00:20:35
JULIA That's just totally, totally like, that is, that is just so, like there's worst things that happen there. 

00:20:45
DR. ALI MARSH Okay, then at home. 

00:20:45
JULIA Then at home. At least with Mum I knew her, but you know, those people were meant to be so-called to be looking after me. A load of crap. 

00:20:55
DR. ALI MARSH So, Julia the foster care sounds like it was really, really difficult. And you sound really angry about it and really distressed. 

00:21:05
JULIA Just like they're supposed to take care of me. I mean, what a load of crap. 

00:21:10
DR. ALI MARSH Where you in foster care a lot? Was it a lot of your early life? 

00:21:15
JULIA I can't remember. I just like, I just want to, I just blocked it out. I don't want know. I don't even want to remember, I can't. 

00:21:20
Grounding 

00:21:25
DR. ALI MARSH All right. So you don't even know what, how old you were when you first went in there? So you don't know how old you were? So, Julia are you able to hear me right now? Have you, are you still with me there? Are you, do you know where you are? Do you know you're here in the present? You look like you've disassociated a bit there. You're in the present here. You're safe with me. You're not back in foster care. Can you hear me? 

00:22:00
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:22:00
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. Okay. You're safe, it's 2012. You're here with me, Ali in the counseling room. Are you able to just look around the room to confirm to yourself that you're here. Can you see those paintings on the wall? You'll just have to look up there and see the paintings. You see that painting up there? Can you see? Are you able to tell me any of the colors in the painting? Is there any red in it? 

00:22:30
JULIA Um, blue and yeah, red, and. 

00:22:35
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

00:22:35
JULIA Green. 

00:22:35
DR. ALI MARSH That's great. That's fantastic. Okay. And can you have a look at the other paintings on the wall. Can you see that one there? The next one along, just there. Yeah. 

00:22:45
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:22:45
DR. ALI MARSH And what are the colors in that one? 

00:22:55
JULIA Um, purple and um, yellow. 

00:22:55
DR. ALI MARSH Mm-hmm. And can you see the jug there with the flowers in it? Can you see the flowers coming out of the jug? 

00:23:00
JULIA Yeah. 

00:23:00
DR. ALI MARSH That's great. And now can you see the window over there? Can you see what's, what's out there through the window? Can you see that tree through the window? 

00:23:10
JULIA The trees. 

00:23:15
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. Yeah. And can you see the leaves on the trees? Can you see them kind of waving in the wind? That's great and you're taking a few deep breathes there. Okay. So, you're kind of starting to feel more kind of in the present. 

00:23:30
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:23:30
Understanding dissociation and explaining grounding 

00:23:30
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah, yeah. So, what seemed to just happen then? When you were talking about foster care it seemed you went right back there. 

00:23:40
JULIA I can't, that's why I block it out. 

00:23:40
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah, yeah. Okay. 

00:23:40
JULIA I just sort of starting having memories and. 

00:23:45
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. Okay. So. 

00:23:45
JULIA I can't go there. 

00:23:50
DR. ALI MARSH (crosstalk) You can't go there. 

00:23:50
JULIA It's too. 

00:23:50
DR. ALI MARSH And that's fine. Too hard. So what we were doing then was what's called grounding. So it's about getting you out of your mind, out of your memories, out of how you're feeling, and just into the present, you know, into the present. Into something that's not your thoughts and not your feelings. And so what I did, I reminded you that you were safe and that you were here in the room and that it was 2012. And then I got you to look around the room and actually have a look at what was going on around you. So that's something that you can actually start to use yourself a little bit. It's gonna take, it can take a little bit of practice. But what was it like for you doing that? 

00:24:35
JULIA Um, it was okay. 

00:24:35
DR. ALI MARSH It was okay. And it seemed to bring you back. 

00:24:40
JULIA Yeah. 

00:24:40
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. Are there any things that you ever use yourself to bring you back? Because I imagine this would, this happens to you from time to time. That you kind of disappear. 

00:24:50
JULIA Mmm. 

00:24:50
DR. ALI MARSH You, you dissociate. 

00:24:50
JULIA That's why I just try forget it because. 

00:24:55
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

00:24:55
JULIA It's just too, it's just, yeah. I can't then stop. 

00:25:00
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:25:00
JULIA And all of the memories, so. 

00:25:00
DR. ALI MARSH It's pretty hard to stop when you're on your own. 

00:25:05
JULIA Yep. 

00:25:05
DR. ALI MARSH So, when we're, when we're. 

00:25:05
JULIA And when I, when I've, when I've come out of it um, then I, you know, I need to go um, do something, have something just to try and. 

00:25:15
DR. ALI MARSH Calm yourself down. 

00:25:15
JULIA Yeah. 

00:25:20
DR. ALI MARSH All right. And I'm, I'm gonna do some breathing with you in a minute to help you to calm down further. 

00:25:25
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:25:25
Introducing breathing techniques 

00:25:25
DR. ALI MARSH Um, so, I might do the breathing with you in a minute to help you to calm down just a little bit because when people get upset or agitated or they're anxious, people either kind of breathe really fast and shallow or else they stop breathing all together. And I notice that quite often that you don't breathe and then you'll take a deep breath. 

00:25:45
JULIA Mmm. 

00:25:45
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah? 

00:25:45
JULIA Yep. 

00:25:50
DR. ALI MARSH You aware of that? 

00:25:50
JULIA At times when I'm, yeah. I'm in, when I was in rehab in the past that they tried to do meditation stuff. And um, yeah, they said, to me that I wasn't very good at breathing. There's times when I just um, I just stop breathing. So now, I'm a bit, I sort of try and. 

00:26:10
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:26:10
JULIA No, that was one thing I did notice since. So every now and then I try and. 

00:26:15
DR. ALI MARSH That's great. 

00:26:15
JULIA Yeah. 

00:26:15
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. So you've already got some awareness of your breathing. That's wonderful. So, Julia, um, would be prepared to try just a little exercise. It's about, what it's about it getting you to breathe how a relaxed person breathes. So you know, a person who's stressed and upset and anxious, you know, they breathe shallow or they'll hold their breathe. People who are relaxed, you know, when we're relaxed we tend to breathe more deeply and more slowly. And that actually sends out, makes our bodies relax too. So for people who are anxious if they can start to breathe more like, more, in a more relaxed fashion, often they can start to feel more relaxed. 

00:26:55
JULIA Okay. 

00:26:55
Controlled breathing 

00:27:00
DR. ALI MARSH So, what I'd, what I'll ask you to do, if you're okay about it. Is to either shut your eyes if you feel happy to do that or else just look gently down at your lap. And then I'll just ask you to do a few things about noticing your breathing and changing it. That's great. Okay. So, as you're just sitting there relaxed just become aware, that's it. Get comfy and just become aware of breathing in and breathing out. Just your normal breathing. And just notice how long it takes for each in breathe and each out breathe. Just be aware of that. That's great. Just noticing how long it takes. You're breathing through your nose, that's terrific. 

00:27:55
[sil.] 

00:27:55
DR. ALI MARSH And now just start to breathe in a little more deeply. Get it down, going down further into your belly. So, you'll probably feel, you should feel your belly rise as you get it in deeper. It's not always easy to do. It's something that can take a bit of practice So just see how much deeper you can get. And the other thing is that quite often when people first start doing this they might feel a little bit dizzy. So it's good to practice it when you're sitting down. Feel a bit dizzy to start with is normal. And that's okay and over time it will pass. So just getting in a bit deeper, that's great. Just imagine getting the air right down to your belly and gradually feeling the rest of your lungs and your chest up. Some people like the air kind of coming in like a wave and filling up their belly and then leaving their belly and coming all the way out again. You're doing really well there. Getting nice and deep there. And now the next step is to see if you can slow that breathing down a little bit. Just slow it down a bit, keeping it nice and deep. And let it out, and in, a little pause and let it out again. Just as slow as you can get it. 

00:29:40
[sil.] 

00:29:50
DR. ALI MARSH You're doing really, really well. 

00:29:55
[sil.] 

00:29:55
DR. ALI MARSH Nice and slow. 

00:30:05
[sil.] 

00:30:05
DR. ALI MARSH Nice and deep. 

00:30:15
[sil.] 

00:30:15
Reviewing controlled breathing practice 

00:30:15
DR. ALI MARSH That's great. Now just whenever you're ready Julia, just gently open your eyes. Have a little look around the room. And we can talk about what it was like for you doing that breathing. 

00:30:40
[sil.] 

00:30:40
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah? 

00:30:40
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:30:55
DR. ALI MARSH And when you say,"Mm-hmm." You looked like you were, you know, sort of managing it to get it deeper. And how are you feeling down? 

00:31:00
JULIA I'm feeling uh, it was good. 

00:31:05
DR. ALI MARSH That's great. 

00:31:05
JULIA It was really good. 

00:31:05
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. So, that seemed to quite relax you. 

00:31:10
JULIA Mmm, mmm, mmm. 

00:31:10
DR. ALI MARSH And it really kind of brought you down, sort of put you back into. 

00:31:15
JULIA I remember now that we used to do this in, in rehab. 

00:31:20
DR. ALI MARSH Hmm. 

00:31:20
JULIA Like we used to do it um, in the mornings and then before we go off to bed or go finish, you know, programs at night. And I remember now that, yeah, and I'd forgotten, I'd forgotten it. 

00:31:35
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. So, that's fantastic. So, you've already got this skill? And it's someting. 

00:31:40
JULIA It's really easy but it's, it's difficult when you, when you're on your own to do that. 

00:31:45
DR. ALI MARSH Yes, it is difficult when your own to do it, when you're on your own to do it. And it's difficult to remember it. 

00:31:50
JULIA Mmm. 

00:31:50
Homework practice 

00:31:50
DR. ALI MARSH So, one of the things that's quite good to do with all these things is to, to try and practice them when you're actually feeling okay. 

00:31:55
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:32:00
DR. ALI MARSH So that then you, it's easy. 

00:32:00
JULIA It's not very often. 

00:32:00
DR. ALI MARSH Okay, not very often but those little tiny moments when you're feeling okay. Um, it's also good to, to try and practice them and, you know, kind of regularly every day as well. 

00:32:10
JULIA Mmm. 

00:32:10
DR. ALI MARSH So that then when you are upset, you can remember to do it. So in terms of, and you only need to practice for a few minutes. I mean that didn't take very long. So, you said in rehab you used to do it before you went to bed. 

00:32:25
JULIA Mmm. 

00:32:25
DR. ALI MARSH Um, now that you're not in rehab and you know, you're just sort of living in your house with your cat. When would be good times for you to practice it? That you think you might be able to remember and perhaps might be able to do it? 

00:32:40
JULIA Um, maybe um, maybe I could do it the first thing in the morning when I wake up before I get up. 

00:32:50
DR. ALI MARSH Okay, okay. 

00:32:50
JULIA You know if I'm going to go have a joint or something. Maybe I could, maybe could do that before that. 

00:33:00
DR. ALI MARSH Wow, that's, that's great. 

00:33:00
JULIA Yeah, yeah. 

00:33:05
DR. ALI MARSH And you know that's two things because not only does it mean that you're practicing when you haven't got anything on board but it means you probably postponing, putting something on board. 

00:33:15
JULIA Mmm. 

00:33:15
DR. ALI MARSH Even if it's just for a few minutes. 

00:33:15
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:33:15
DR. ALI MARSH That actually is, is really helpful. It's the kind of start of. 

00:33:20
JULIA We could try it. 

00:33:20
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah, using a little bit, you know, less frequently even. Okay. So if you want to give that a go for a week just, just doing a few minutes breathing in the morning. 

00:33:35
JULIA Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:33:35
Summary of session 

00:33:35
DR. ALI MARSH Um, so in terms of what we've done, you know, you, when we were, you know, going through the session there. 

00:33:40
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:33:40
DR. ALI MARSH You were talking, you know, you were talking and you got upset and you dissociated. You did some grounding. 

00:33:50
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:33:50
DR. ALI MARSH And then you were, you, so we did grounding. We came back into the room and back into the present. 

00:33:55
JULIA Mm-hmm/ 

00:33:55
DR. ALI MARSH But you were still not feeling very good. 

00:33:55
JULIA Mmm. 

00:33:55
DR. ALI MARSH And then we did. 

00:33:55
JULIA After that I feel really. 

00:33:55
DR. ALI MARSH You feel really terrible. 

00:34:00
JULIA I feel really spacey. 

00:34:00
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

00:34:00
JULIA And that's why I usually go use because I feel really out of it. 

00:34:05
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah, yeah. And then we did the breathing. Are you still feeling really spacey and wanting to use now? 

00:34:10
JULIA Um, I feel, no. I feel, I feel, I feel okay. I feel okay. 

00:34:20
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. So, you can use that breathing also. You know, after. 

00:34:25
JULIA Yeah. 

00:34:25
DR. ALI MARSH You've been spacey to try to bring yourself back to feeling a bit better to feeling okay. 

00:34:30
JULIA Mmm, mmm. 

00:34:30
DR. ALI MARSH Um, what I do have here that grounding that we just did. There are lots of different ways to do grounding. 

00:34:35
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:34:40
DR. ALI MARSH And um, we're pretty much at the end of this session today. 

00:34:40
JULIA Mmm. 

00:34:40
DR. ALI MARSH So, I won't go through them. But I got a little handout here that you might want to read and have a look at. It's, it's got lots of other ways to do it. But you might want to practice at home as well. 

00:34:50
JULIA Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:34:50
DR. ALI MARSH Okay, so would you like to take that with you and have a look at it. 

00:34:55
JULIA Mmm. 

00:34:55
DR. ALI MARSH Okay, that's great. 

00:35:00
[music] 

00:35:00
Creating a safe place 

00:35:00
DR. ALI MARSH So, Julia, we've spent the most of the session so far talking about your boyfriend and what's going on there. And come up with, you've come up with a bit of a plan for how to deal with it. 

00:35:20
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:35:20
DR. ALI MARSH And um, we checked on how you would go on with your controlled breathing and your grounding. That seems to be going pretty well, actually. Doesn't it? 

00:35:25
JULIA Mmm-hmm. 

00:35:25
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. Okay. So there's um, you know, at the beginning I said there's a number of different things that we'd try. So I'd wonder if you'd be interested in trying another one today? 

00:35:40
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:35:40
Introducing a "safe place" 

00:35:40
DR. ALI MARSH So, it's about um, you know, creating kind of a, a safe place in your imagination that you can go to whenever you really need just to have a little break from what's going on. When you need to really calm down and just feel calm, relaxed and good. 

00:35:55
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:35:55
Dealing with anxiety 

00:35:55
DR. ALI MARSH So, um, does that sound okay? All right. So, what we'll start with, if you're happy to close your eyes. 

00:36:05
JULIA I'm, I mean, I've tried this before. 

00:36:10
DR. ALI MARSH Ah, have you. Okay. 

00:36:10
JULIA Yeah, um, and like, it's really, really hard to. 

00:36:15
DR. ALI MARSH Find somewhere safe. Okay. 

00:36:20
JULIA Yeah. Like when we're done this sort of stuff in the past, like when I been like in big groups and doing it, often I end up not. 

00:36:30
DR. ALI MARSH Not doing it. 

00:36:30
JULIA Not doing it 'cuz I can't, I can't like, you know. 

00:36:36
DR. ALI MARSH It's hard to find somewhere. 

00:36:36
JULIA Yeah, it's pretty. 

00:36:36
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. That's understandable. 

00:36:36
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:36:36
DR. ALI MARSH When you've done it before in the big groups have they left you to find your own safe place? 

00:36:40
JULIA Yeah. 

00:36:45
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:36:45
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:36:45
DR. ALI MARSH Because I could do it in a way where I lead you somewhere and you go down some and then you come out into a safe place. And I can lead you to create it yourself. So I'll tell you what's there. 

00:36:55
JULIA Okay. 

00:36:55
DR. ALI MARSH And you can go around and explore it. And you can put some other little things in there if you want. But that might work a little bit better. 

00:37:00
JULIA Yeah, 'cuz the others I know, I know it hasn't, hasn't worked. 

00:37:05
DR. ALI MARSH Okay, just left you too much on your own and you couldn't find it. 

00:37:10
JULIA Yes. Yeah, my head, I kept getting like my thoughts just race over and I just can't. 

00:37:15
DR. ALI MARSH Just left on your own. 

00:37:15
JULIA Yeah. 

00:37:15
DR. ALI MARSH All the thoughts come in and you can't actually think of anything safe. 

00:37:20
JULIA No. 

00:37:20
DR. ALI MARSH Fare enough. Well, if you're and, and look when, when we do it if, if it's not working or if you're getting distressed. If it's too hard then just open your eyes and say, look it's not working. 

00:37:30
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:37:30
DR. ALI MARSH And that's fine because not everything suits everybody. 

00:37:35
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:37:35
DR. ALI MARSH So, you know, we'll try things and you take the things that work for you and leave the others. That's fine. 

00:37:40
JULIA Okay. 

00:37:40
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah? 

00:37:40
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:37:40
Safe place visualization 

00:37:40
DR. ALI MARSH Okay, so, just gently shut your eyes, get comfy in the chair. That's great. Take a few deep breaths. Settle yourself in. 

00:38:00
[sil.] 

00:38:00
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. That's great. Now Julia, what I'm going to do is I'm going to get you to imagine, to start with that you're walking down a path in the bush. And as you're walking down the path, just notice the trees around you. Notice your feet crunching on some leaves underneath them. Notice the feel of the air, warm but not too warm. Slight breeze. Notice that the sky's blue, a couple of tiny little clouds floating around. It's a beautiful day. Notice walking along down this path you're feeling kind of pretty good walking down along this path. And you see up ahead of you a very large limestone wall with a door in it. Quite a big door with a sort of arched frame around it. And as you come closer you realize it's actually a doorway and you look through, you come up to it and you look through the door way. And you see a set of stone stairs leading down. And as you stand at the top of the stairs you've got a feeling if you walk down those stairs there's going to be something very, very nice at the bottom of them. And you really want to walk down them. And so just let yourself start to walk down the stairs. And with every step you take you find yourself feeling better and better, more calm, more centered, more happy, lighter, and you continue to walk down each step. Just feeling better, and better, and calmer, and calmer. More and more relaxed with every step. Continue walking down the steps one after the other. Now you've just got three steps to go. So just take those three steps one after the other. And now you find yourself at the bottom of the stairs feeling very calm, very relaxed, really happy, really light with not cares at all. And you look around you and in front of you, you see a grassy expanse and just beyond that grassy expanse, it's not very wide, you see a lake. Just walk out across the grass looking around you. Walk towards the lake. Noticing everything that you can see. Notice that there's lots of shady trees. You can hear birds in the trees. Notice that you can hear the sound of quacking ducks. And as you look out across the lake you can see a mother duck with a few little baby ducks following her. And as you look further around the lake you can see that there are quite a few ducks around the place. Just all happily floating around the lake. Just pedaling underneath the water. Continue to look around and notice everything else that you can see. Have a look and see if there's a seat for you to have a set down on. Or where there's a nice patch of shade under a tree that you would like to sit down on. Jut explore everything that you can see and hear, and smell in this beautiful safe place that you've found yourself. You're completely safe here, there's absolutely nothing to hurt you, there are just ducks. And if you look really closely you might even see a little rabbit poking its nose out of some undergrowth. It's all very calm, very safe, and you can truly relax here because you are just really safe. And the air's warm, sky's blue, it's just beautiful. You feel calm and relaxed. So just get yourself comfortable there in your safe place. Make any changes to it that you like to, to make it even more safe, more calm, and more relaxed for you. Just explore everything there. And just notice how you feel while you're there in your safe place. Just notice the feeling of calm. Notice the feeling feeling of safety. Notice the feeling of relaxation. Notice how it feels in your body and just enjoy it. 

00:43:30
[sil.] 

00:43:35
DR. ALI MARSH And now really being aware of that, that feeling you've got, the feeling of safety, and calm and relaxation. And knowing that you can come back to this safe place whenever you want. Just gently start to make your way back to the stairs. You're walking across the lawn, the grass, and you feeling really, really good. And you know you can come back here whenever you want. And knowing that just walk gently up the stairs and as you walk the stairs you're continuing to feel really safe, really calm, really continent, really relaxed. And you keep on walking up the stairs and now you come out through the door, through the big doorway at the top of the stairs, and you're now back onto the bush track. And just start to walk down that bush track, still feeling very, very calm, continent, relaxed, and safe. And still feeling all those lovely feelings. Whenever you're ready just open your eyes and come back into the room. And when you're ready let me know what that experience was like. 

00:45:25
[sil.] 

00:45:25
JULIA It was really weird. 

00:45:30
DR. ALI MARSH Mmm. 

00:45:30
JULIA Because when you said, um, I could do something to make it safer. 

00:45:35
DR. ALI MARSH Uh-huh. 

00:45:35
JULIA I um, not even thinking I start straight away got up and put a lock on the door. 

00:45:45
DR. ALI MARSH Wow! 

00:45:45
JULIA So that no one else could come in. 

00:45:45
DR. ALI MARSH Come in. 

00:45:50
JULIA 'Cuz otherwise I couldn't still relax 'cuz I was scared. 

00:45:50
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:45:50
JULIA I'm scared that someone might. 

00:45:55
DR. ALI MARSH Come in. 

00:45:55
JULIA Come in. 

00:45:55
DR. ALI MARSH And after you put on the the lock on the door how did you feel? 

00:46:00
JULIA That was good. 

00:46:00
DR. ALI MARSH Great. Okay. And you can do other things to that, to that place to make it safer or more relaxing, whatever you want to do. That's your place now. 

00:46:10
JULIA Mmm. 

00:46:10
DR. ALI MARSH And you can make it however you want it. 

00:46:15
JULIA The only thing, I'm a bit worried about is um, like, with, with you saying it, it was good 'cuz I had to listen to you. 

00:46:25
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:46:25
JULIA And so I could concentrate on it. 

00:46:25
DR. ALI MARSH Mm-hmm. 

00:46:30
JULIA But um, I've tried these things as I said in the past. I'm not very good because I can't. 

00:46:35
DR. ALI MARSH Sure. 

00:46:35
JULIA Keep it in my head and I, all the other thoughts and everything else that's going on for me just overtake. So, I can't. 

00:46:40
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah, and that's really normal. And you know, over time you can, you can learn to do that better as you practice it more and as we do other things. 

00:46:50
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:46:50
DR. ALI MARSH The other thing that we can do, Julia, is we could make a CD of it. So that you can actually play it yourself at home or we could record it on to your phone. 

00:47:00
JULIA That would be really good. 

00:47:00
DR. ALI MARSH I guess what we can do is practice it a little bit more in here. 

00:47:05
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:47:05
DR. ALI MARSH And sometimes um, and that, that can make it a little bit easier. And also as you do some of the other, the other strategies that I'm going to teach you. You'll be able to manage that better. 

00:47:15
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:47:15
DR. ALI MARSH But the other thing is sometimes you might just want to summon up this place, even just for, you know, up, you know, for just a very short period of time. 

00:47:25
JULIA Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:47:25
DR. ALI MARSH And just thinking about it or even think about the feelings you had. So it might not be something that you spend as long getting there and doing as you get used to doing it. It's just something you think, oh my safe place. And you might think about, oh the lake and the ducks, and the lock on the door. 

00:47:40
JULIA I felt sad too. 

00:47:45
DR. ALI MARSH You felt sad, did you? 

00:47:45
JULIA Mmm. 

00:47:45
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

00:47:45
JULIA I felt really sad because like, you know, I've never had anywhere like that. 

00:47:50
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. So it felt sad. 

00:47:55
JULIA Mmm. 

00:47:55
DR. ALI MARSH That, that you hadn't felt safe. 

00:47:55
JULIA Mmm, mmm. 

00:47:55
DR. ALI MARSH But you do, you can, we can make this place a place that would be easier for you to go to. 

00:48:00
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:48:00
DR. ALI MARSH Julia, so that you can get a little rest, you can get a little rest. You know sadness, sadness is kind of a normal feeling for people to have. And it can be an okay feeling sometimes. 

00:48:15
JULIA Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:48:15
DR. ALI MARSH And you manage that feeling and it didn't stop you kind of feeling safe there, did it? 

00:48:20
JULIA Mmm. 

00:48:20
DR. ALI MARSH You were enjoying it. 

00:48:20
JULIA But I think that was because you were there. 

00:48:25
DR. ALI MARSH Sure. And at that moment that's important for you. 

00:48:30
[music] 

00:48:30
Mindfulness 

00:48:30
Introducing mindfulness 

00:48:30
DR. ALI MARSH So, Julia, we've done uh, we've, we've, we've been doing a few strategies and things. 

00:48:40
JULIA Uh-huh. 

00:48:40
DR. ALI MARSH To manage your emotions better. Now one that I'd like to talk to you about today can be a bit puzzling for people at first. 

00:48:50
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:48:50
DR. ALI MARSH It's um, you've heard of mindfulness? 

00:48:55
JULIA Um, yeah I heard something on, on the radio the other day. Something about um, that it's like the new, the new rave or something. 

00:49:05
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah, like the new big thing or something. 

00:49:05
JULIA Yeah. There was some, some, I think some, some celebrity being interviewed about her[00:49:15 doing it or something. But I didn't really. 

00:49:10
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah, didn't really, didn't really pay much attention. Well, one of the things, what mindfulness is about. 

00:49:20
JULIA Mmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:49:20
DR. ALI MARSH It's actually about kind of being in the present moment and learning to accept our experience, what's going on for us. At the moment, you know, people, people, a lot of people, most people really, we spend a lot of our time kind of caught up in our own thoughts or kind of like caught up in thinking about how terrible we feel. 

00:49:45
JULIA Mmm. 

00:49:45
DR. ALI MARSH And getting really upset about it. Or we spend a lot of our time trying to avoid thinking about anything or thinking about anything. 

00:49:55
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:49:55
DR. ALI MARSH Um, and what happens when we do that all the time is, particularly when we try to avoid feeling anything and we don't, or thinking anything then we don't kind of gradually learn how to tolerate or to be able to feel things without getting upset. 

00:50:15
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:50:15
DR. ALI MARSH And when we get caught up in feeling upset and thinking how terrible it is. 

00:50:20
JULIA Mmm. 

00:50:20
DR. ALI MARSH Often it can make us feel even worse. 

00:50:20
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:50:20
DR. ALI MARSH So what mindfulness is about is learning just to accept our feelings, our thoughts, our sense, our bodily sensations without judging them, without trying to push them away. 

00:50:35
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:50:35
DR. ALI MARSH Now that might sound a little weird. 

00:50:40
JULIA Mmm. 

00:50:45
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

00:50:45
JULIA It does. It sounds a bit scary actually. 

00:50:45
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah, and mindfulness wouldn't be, you wouldn't use it when you're feel really overwhelmed. 

00:50:50
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:50:50
DR. ALI MARSH Because then you need to use grounding. 

00:50:50
JULIA Or drugs. 

00:50:55
DR. ALI MARSH Or drugs. Yes. So, at the moment you'd use mindfulness um, when things are as intense. 

00:51:00
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:51:00
DR. ALI MARSH It'll be kind of more practicing to, practicing, you know, being able to manage less intense emotions or being able to actually just feel them without trying to push them away. Being able to acknowledging your thoughts without judging them or push them away. 

00:51:15
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:51:20
DR. ALI MARSH But also without getting too caught up in them. 

00:51:20
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:51:20
DR. ALI MARSH Now it can be pretty hard to do. Everybody finds it hard to do. 

00:51:25
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:51:25
DR. ALI MARSH And it can be frustrating sometimes. 

00:51:25
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:51:30
DR. ALI MARSH Um, and it's really just about trying it, just practicing it in a little bit. 

00:51:30
JULIA Mmm, mmm. 

00:51:35
DR. ALI MARSH Would you, and we often use the breath as a kind of an anchor to bring us into the present to help us to do that. 

00:51:40
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:51:40
DR. ALI MARSH So, would you like to, would you be prepared to try a little mindfulness exercise now? 

00:51:45
JULIA Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:51:45
Mindfulness practice 

00:51:45
DR. ALI MARSH We might actually, I might start off with the mindfulness exercise which might seem a little bit more ground, like grounding. But it's still a mindfulness exercise. So this one is really about just, first of all being mindful of what you can see. So, would you like to just kind of look around the room. To start with. Maybe, maybe looking out the window might be a better thing to do. 

00:52:10
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:52:10
DR. ALI MARSH So, if you look out the window, just notice everything that you can see out there. Notice the tree, notice the sky. Just really study what you can see. Just look at it. And what most people find when they, when they just look at something is some, or when they try to focus on something that all sorts of thoughts floating to their mind. 

00:52:35
JULIA Mmm. 

00:52:35
DR. ALI MARSH So just keep looking out the window and as you notice thoughts floating into your mind. Just notice them, don't try to push them away, don't be upset with them. Just think, well they're just thoughts. Um, but just notice them. Oh, I'm thinking about my boyfriend and then bring your attention back to looking at that tree out the window. Noticing all the colors of the leaves, just everything that you can see. 

00:53:00
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:53:00
DR. ALI MARSH And as you do that, you know, other thoughts are coming. Just notice them, just not buy into them, and don't go with them. Just, just let them go and just let your attention go back to the tree. And as you do that it's likely if you're like most people that thoughts will just keep on coming in and trying to drag your attention away. That's really normal. That's okay, again just notice them. Don't be upset by them, just bring your attention back to the tree. So just keep looking at that tree, just noticing your thoughts and letting them go. Now just see how you go with that just for you know, about a minute or so. 

00:53:50
[sil.] 

00:53:55
DR. ALI MARSH Just noticing your thoughts, letting them go. 

00:54:00
[sil.] 

00:54:00
JULIA I think that that's probably enough. 

00:54:05
DR. ALI MARSH That's enough for you now? 

00:54:05
JULIA Mmm. 

00:54:05
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. There's another one we can try too. 

00:54:10
JULIA Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:54:10
DR. ALI MARSH Which is instead of having your eyes open like that, you have your eyes shut and you just listen to all the sounds you can hear. 

00:54:15
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:54:15
DR. ALI MARSH Would you like to try that one for just a little bit? 

00:54:15
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:54:20
DR. ALI MARSH Just shut your eyes, just listen to all the sounds that you can hear. Just notice everything that you can hear. Once again you'll probably have thoughts that float in, just notice them and let them go. And bring your attention back to the sounds. You might be able to hear the slight hum of the air conditioner. 

00:54:45
JULIA I hear my stomach. 

00:54:45
DR. ALI MARSH You hear your stomach. 

00:54:50
JULIA Yeah. 

00:54:50
DR. ALI MARSH This is a nice one to do at the beach because if you sit at the beach you could hear the waves rolling in. It's a real nice one to do at the beach. 

00:55:00
[sil.] 

00:55:00
Reviewing mindfulness 

00:55:00
DR. ALI MARSH And as you're listening to the sounds, just noticing your thoughts and letting them go. Okay. That's great. Now while we're doing that would you like to try another one or talk about those ones before we try another one. 

00:55:20
JULIA Um, I think I like the second one more than the first one. 

00:55:25
DR. ALI MARSH You like the second one better, okay. 

00:55:25
JULIA Yes, I just couldn't concentrate out there because, yeah, it was just like almost to far. 

00:55:35
DR. ALI MARSH Okay, too far. 

00:55:35
JULIA And sometimes I better with my eyes closed so I don't get distracted. 

00:55:40
DR. ALI MARSH Mm-hmm, that's great. Well, they're good things to learn. And everybody's different those things. Some people like looking at things and doing it that way. Some people like shutting their eyes and listening to things. 

00:55:50
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:55:50
DR. ALI MARSH And now I, and the other thing is that, you know, how long you do it for you can start out with just a little time and gradually expand it. 

00:56:00
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:56:00
DR. ALI MARSH I know at the moment it's important to have my voice, and if I leave it for too long without my voice there that, you know, things get. 

00:56:05
JULIA It's too much. 

00:56:05
DR. ALI MARSH It gets too much. Yeah, get a bit scary. And so, it's just, it's going to be about starting off with little short periods of time and gradually increasing them. 

00:56:15
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:56:15
Mindfulness and breath 

00:56:20
DR. ALI MARSH So, excuse me. So what I'd like to try now is just doing the same thing but with you focusing on your breath. So, it's not controlled breathing, it's different. So, if you're happy. 

00:56:30
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:56:30
DR. ALI MARSH Shut your eyes. I'm going to do two, two different breath ones and you can see which one you like best. So the first one, I'll ask you to focus just on the air going in and out of your nostrils. And the next one, I'll get you to focus on the air going all the way down into your lungs and back. So, just to start with, we'll do the nostril one. So just, just notice the sensations around your nostrils as you breath in and as you breath out. You might be aware that the air is slightly cooler as it goes in. Slightly warmer as it goes out. Some people can feel the air going across their upper lip, other people can't. And as you focus on the air going in and out of your nostrils, again if you're like everybody else there will be all sorts of thoughts that start floating into your mind or some people rushing into your mind. And when they come into your mind just gently acknowledge them, notice what they are, but don't go with them. Just let them go and bring your attention back to the air going in and out of your nostrils. Know that it's normal to have thoughts floating around in your mind trying to drag your attention away. That's what our minds do. And knowing that it's also normal to maybe feel some irritation that they won't stop. And if you feel some irritation and you find yourself saying, "Oh, this is stupid." or "This is annoying." Just notice that. That's another thought. Don't judge it, don't be upset with yourself. Don't be angry at the thought. Just, they're all just thoughts. Just acknowledge them, let them go, and bring your attention back to the air going in and out of your nostrils. 

00:58:40
[sil.] 

00:58:40
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:58:40
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. That was enough time for you? 

00:58:40
JULIA Pretty hard. 

00:58:50
DR. ALI MARSH It's very hard. I know. 

00:58:50
JULIA Mmm. 

00:58:50
DR. ALI MARSH Do you want to try the other breath one now? 

00:58:50
JULIA Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:58:50
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. So, just shut your eyes again. 

00:58:55
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

00:58:55
DR. ALI MARSH And this time, we're going to do the same thing. We're just, but this time you're going to notice the air as it goes all the way down into your lungs. You're just going to follow it. And all the way out again. So, just notice what it feels like, as the air goes into your lungs and out again. Just follow that air with your attention. You might notice your chest raising. Just notice it as it goes in and out. And again, just notice any thoughts that float through your mind. Gently acknowledge them. Be gently, don't judge them, and just let them go. And bring your attention back to the air going in and out of your lungs. And if you find yourself judging a thought, just note it. That's all, I'm judging that thought. And then let, that's another thought and let that thought go. And just keep your attention on the air going in and out of your lungs. The air goes in and out and in and out. It can sometimes help if you say to yourself, in and out. 

01:00:30
[sil.] 

01:00:30
DR. ALI MARSH So just try that for as long as you can. That's enough for you? 

01:00:35
JULIA That's enough. 

01:00:35
Reviewing breath exercises 

01:00:35
DR. ALI MARSH Okay, Julia, you did really well with that. To hang in there with all that. What was it like for you? 

01:00:45
JULIA Um, it's really, really hard to stay. 

01:00:45
DR. ALI MARSH Yes. 

01:00:45
JULIA I was thinking about all the things. 

01:00:50
DR. ALI MARSH Mmm. 

01:00:50
JULIA I have to do. 

01:00:55
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

01:00:55
JULIA And um, it sort of makes me realize how like, it's really hard to try and relax because when you do, like when I, I don't stop very often. Like I, I'm always, like I always feel like I'm, like I got to keep moving. And so, I wanted to sort of get up and go and do all the things that I have to do. 

01:01:20
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. So, very hard to relax. 

01:01:25
JULIA Mmm. 

01:01:25
DR. ALI MARSH And you thought it just makes you aware of how busy your mind is too. 

01:01:25
JULIA Mmm. 

01:01:30
DR. ALI MARSH Doesn't it? 

01:01:30
JULIA Mmm. 

01:01:30
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. Okay. So, all of this is great. It's really good awareness. And yes, it is very difficult. 

01:01:35
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:01:35
DR. ALI MARSH Doing these, these mindfulness exercises. They're not easy at all. 

01:01:40
JULIA Yeah. 

01:01:40
DR. ALI MARSH And um, they take. I mean if you're prepared to have a go at them and do little bits of practice um, it will be interesting, it might be interesting for you to see how you go. 

01:01:55
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:01:55
DR. ALI MARSH Did you like the one with the nostrils better or the one with the air going all the way in and out. 

01:02:00
JULIA The air going down. 

01:02:00
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah, going down. Okay. So, you're quite, you said that the, the listening one was kind of okay? 

01:02:05
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:02:05
DR. ALI MARSH And that the air going going in and out was better than the one of the nostrils. 

01:02:10
JULIA Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

01:02:10
DR. ALI MARSH So, and you might want to just play around with them because you can. The shutting your eyes, you can't obviously be doing that if you're driving a car or riding a bike. 

01:02:20
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:02:20
DR. ALI MARSH Um, but with the um, with the air going in and out, you can actually do that with your eyes open, too. 

01:02:30
JULIA Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

01:02:30
DR. ALI MARSH If you wanted. 

01:02:30
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:02:30
DR. ALI MARSH So you could probably do that anywhere. 

01:02:35
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:02:35
DR. ALI MARSH You know, sitting on the bench waiting for the bus. 

01:02:35

DR. ALI MARSH Hi, Julia. How are you going today? 

01:03:05
JULIA Uh, I was going to cancel today, Ali. I'm really um, yeah, I'm not going to be. I don't think, I'm just, huh, I just feel so angry. And I don't, huh, I'm just so angry. I don't know if I'm angry at myself or if I'm angry at Joel, or, or what. So, I'm, I don't know how much use, so I was just going to cancel. But then I remembered what you said, sometimes when you feel like, this is a good time.

JULIA To come and I'm just. 

01:03:35

01:03:45
JULIA Huh. 

01:03:45
DR. ALI MARSH What's happening? 

01:03:45
JULIA Joel is just like, uh. I told, you know, I end up with these loser boyfriends. Like, you know, I told him much it means that I'm coming here. And he says, oh you know, Hon, I'll support you all the way. You know, it's great you're trying, you're trying to get yourself together. You know, whatever I can do to help. I'll, I'll, I will. And then you know, and, and so I, you know. I believe him and I think that's fantastic. He is such a square, I'm really lucky. I'm with him and he wants to help me. And then you know, last night, he's going I can't let, let's, let's go and get some speed. 

01:04:30
DR. ALI MARSH Oh no. 

01:04:30
JULIA You know, let's, and let's have a really big night of it. And it's like, like you know, huh. 

01:04:40
DR. ALI MARSH So is it's all these things and you kind of trust him and you think he's there? 

01:04:45
JULIA Oh yeah, he says he is. 

01:04:45
DR. ALI MARSH And then he, and then he, and then what happened? 

01:04:50
JULIA Well, you know, it's like then well because he wants to use, you know, oh, to bad about me. You know, it's about all about Joel. 

01:04:55
Emotion identification 

01:05:00
DR. ALI MARSH And so you're feeling really, really angry. But I wonder if there's something else going on with you as well. Cuz, you're angry. 

01:05:05
JULIA What do you mean? 

01:05:05
DR. ALI MARSH You're angry about Joel? 

01:05:10
JULIA Oh, I'm angry, I'm angry at the whole. 

01:05:10
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

01:05:10
JULIA Like, I'm just angry that I, you know, I trust. I, you know, you know how hard it is for me to trust. 

01:05:15
DR. ALI MARSH I know. 

01:05:20
JULIA And I trusted him, and. 

01:05:20
DR. ALI MARSH You're sounding a little bit upset to me there too. You're sounding a little bit kind of hurt or sad. 

01:05:25
JULIA I'm really sad. Yeah. Like, I'm, you know. I'd like, I had. Like I feel I had no choice. Like I didn't want to be on my own. 

01:05:35
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

01:05:40
JULIA You know, I didn't, I didn't want to go and use but I didn't want to be on my own. And it's like, I just didn't know what to. 

01:05:45
DR. ALI MARSH Do. 

01:05:45
JULIA I didn't know what to do. And you know, I didn't know. And you know, I just, you know, it was just. And then I fail, I fail again. You know, I fail again. You know, I mean. 

01:06:00
DR. ALI MARSH So you're, so you're feeling kind of really stuck because you didn't want to use. 

01:06:05
JULIA No. 

01:06:05
DR. ALI MARSH And you wanted Joel to support you the way he said he was going to. And then he. 

01:06:10
JULIA And he just didn't. 

01:06:10
DR. ALI MARSH So you're getting furious with him about that. But then you were feeling really stuck because you didn't want to be on your own and you were feeling quite desparate. And you were feeling, you were feeling quite disappointed that he didn't support you. Feeling kind of? 

01:06:25
JULIA He's never, he never understands how I feel. 

01:06:30
DR. ALI MARSH So you felt let down. 

01:06:30
JULIA Yeah. 

01:06:30
DR. ALI MARSH Real let down. 

01:06:30
JULIA Yeah. And you know, and then really, really, you know, like I, I've just. Yeah, it's like, all I wanted is someone to help me to, to, to do this. And you know. 

01:06:45
DR. ALI MARSH And then you were, and you said you were feeling sad. And you were feeling sad. What were, are you feeling sad at, because you're, you feel? 

01:06:55
JULIA I'm feeling angry. 

01:06:55
DR. ALI MARSH Let down? Yeah. 

01:06:55
JULIA I'm feeling sad and I'm feeling like an absolute bloody, you know, loser because huh, I then went and used with him and you know. 

01:07:10
DR. ALI MARSH Okay, so. 

01:07:10
JULIA That's why I said, I just didn't want to come today. 

01:07:10
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

01:07:10
JULIA 'Cuz like, you know, what's, you know, what's the point of coming I just, you know, I just left myself down again. And I've let you down, and I, you know. 

01:07:20
Identification of associated thoughts 

01:07:25
DR. ALI MARSH So, there's a lot of thoughts that come up so easily for you aren't they? I've let myself down, I've let you down, I'm a, I'm a loser. So you're a failure? You feel like a failure. So, correct me if I'm wrong. But you've been doing pretty well your using lately. Didn't you go a week without losing? 

01:07:45
JULIA Yeah but, yeah but you know, like, well, you know, I've been using still the pot and the pills. 

01:07:50
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah, but. 

01:07:50
JULIA I still use alcohol. But yeah, I haven't used speed and I was really, um. 

01:07:55
DR. ALI MARSH Hmm. 

01:07:55
JULIA I was really glad about that. But, you know. 

01:08:00
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

01:08:00
JULIA 6 days. 

01:08:00
Challenging negative beliefs and highlighting progress 

01:08:00
DR. ALI MARSH So you went 6 days and then you used once this week. Now, that sounds pretty good to me. 

01:08:10
JULIA Why? 

01:08:10
DR. ALI MARSH And you, because that's much better than you've been doing before. Isn't it? 

01:08:15
JULIA You reckon? 

01:08:15
DR. ALI MARSH Well, you tell me. When did you last go 6 days without using before last week. 

01:08:20
JULIA Oh, I can't remember. 

01:08:20
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. So, I mean that was, I mean, that's really impressive. I think you do very well. And then you're in a really difficult position last night. 

01:08:35
JULIA He knows my I don't like being on my own. 

01:08:35
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. And, and we hadn't really talked about that. We hadn't really come up with a plan for that sort of situation. 

01:08:45
JULIA Hmm. 

01:08:45
DR. ALI MARSH Had we? 

01:08:45
JULIA No. 

01:08:45
DR. ALI MARSH And so you. 

01:08:45
JULIA I didn't have, I just felt like I didn't. 

01:08:50
DR. ALI MARSH You didn't have. 

01:08:50
JULIA I didn't have a choice. 

01:08:50
Origin of thoughts 

01:08:50
DR. ALI MARSH No. And so you felt as if you didn't have a choice. And you know, we'll need to look at that and see what other things you could do in that situation. But what really interests me is how you go straight, instead of seeing that you did 6 days, and actually did really well. You go straight to I'm useless, I'm a failure. 

01:09:10
JULIA But I am, but I am. 

01:09:10
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. I know you believe that. And I'm wondering whether that's something that's some, I mean you've believed that for a long time. Where does that come from? Did somebody use to? 

01:09:25
JULIA What do you mean? 

01:09:25
DR. ALI MARSH Did somebody use to tell you, you were a failure as a child? 

01:09:30
JULIA My Mum, as I said, my Mum, Mum taught, constantly said, that I was just like, yeah. I mean, I, I was. I could never make her happy. I could never um, I could never do things right. I was always upsetting her. 

01:09:50
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

01:09:50
JULIA I was making too much noise or I wasn't cleaning up my room. I was always in the way when she wanted some man over. Like she'd say, I wish you weren't here. You know, I could. 

01:10:00
DR. ALI MARSH So Mum used to be always giving you the idea that you're a failure, that you're useless. All those things that you say to yourself now. Isn't that right? 

01:10:15
JULIA Um, yeah. Yeah, well, yeah. I mean I can't, yeah. I can't seem to, I can't seem to make any, anyone sort of, you know, happy. 

01:10:25
DR. ALI MARSH So, so, what I wonder, Julia. Is where the part of what happens now. Is that anything that you do that's not, that you feel is not right suddenly you just starting doing to yourself what Mum used to do. And sometimes it's maybe, you know, I think you might be being harsh on yourself, over harsh on yourself. 

01:10:50
JULIA You think so? 

01:10:50
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

01:10:55
JULIA I hadn't thought of that. 

01:10:55
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. So, just think about it. Um, if you think of this current situation. 

01:11:05
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:11:05
DR. ALI MARSH If you actually think about that fact that you actually went 6 days. 

01:11:05
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:11:05
DR. ALI MARSH Without using, and then you've had one lapse. 

01:11:10
JULIA I was feeling really good about it. 

01:11:10
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. And you had one lapse and you're here today. Is that a little bit different from the way things have been in the past? 

01:11:20
JULIA I suppose so. 

01:11:20
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah, okay. 

01:11:20
JULIA I mean I'm really trying. 

01:11:20
DR. ALI MARSH I know you are. You are trying. So, what I'd actually like to do is a little bit of work around those beliefs that you've got about yourself. Those beliefs about, I'm useless and I'm, you know. 

01:11:40
JULIA I'm a failure. 

01:11:40
DR. ALI MARSH I'm a failure. Those beliefs. And I know you believe them. I know that, just sort of talking about that you were actually overly harsh on yourself, doesn't stop you believing them. 

01:11:50
JULIA 'Cuz, 'cuz I've not got anything to like, you know, what have I done. I mean, I haven't, I haven't got. 

01:12:00
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

01:12:00
JULIA You know, I haven't, I haven't done anything with my life. 

01:12:00
DR. ALI MARSH No, you're trying really hard now. And you're doing really, really well. But what I'd like to do is just think about where they came from. 

01:12:10
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:12:10
DR. ALI MARSH You know the sorts of things that Mum used to say to you as a little girl. 

01:12:15
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:12:15
DR. ALI MARSH Now when she used to say those things to you and you just took them on-board and believed them and you still do. But do you think you were a failure, useless failure as a little girl? Do you still believe that? 

01:12:30
JULIA Well, I tried hard. I really. 

01:12:35
DR. ALI MARSH Mmm. 

01:12:35
JULIA I really, I wanted to be, I wanted to be good and I didn't want to upset Mum. And I tried to keep my room clean. 

01:12:45
DR. ALI MARSH Mmm. 

01:12:45
JULIA Tried to keep quiet and I'd get up in the morning and go to school on my own because I didn't want uh, disturb her and I'd go and get the alcohol. You know, I'd go down to the bottle shop when she wanted it because she was too sick. Mum was sick a lot so she'd be too sick to go and get it, so I'd go and do that. And I tried and clean up our, our place. And but it didn't matter what I did, it never, I could. 

01:13:25
DR. ALI MARSH It never pleased her 

01:13:25
JULIA No. 

01:13:25
DR. ALI MARSH And so, it sounds like you did an awful lot? 

01:13:30
JULIA It felt, felt like. 

01:13:30
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

01:13:30
JULIA Like always, like now. It's like now. I still keep. 

01:13:35
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

01:13:35
JULIA Trying to keep everything going so that. 

01:13:40
DR. ALI MARSH And yet you still felt like you were a failure because you could never please here, Mum. 

01:13:45
JULIA Mmm. 

01:13:45
DR. ALI MARSH If you saw another little girl doing all of that. 

01:13:50
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:13:50
DR. ALI MARSH And here Mum, you know, telling her she was useless and failure and she was believing she was useless and a failure. What would you think about that little girl? 

01:14:05
JULIA I'd feel really, I'd feel really sad for her. 

01:14:10
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. So you think you would feel really sad for her because she's trying so hard. 

01:14:15
JULIA So, I know it's so not okay to treat children like that. 

01:14:20
DR. ALI MARSH Right. It's so not okay to treat children like that. And would you think she was a failure? 

01:14:25
JULIA No. 

01:14:25
DR. ALI MARSH You wouldn't think she was a failure. So? 

01:14:30
JULIA I just think that Mum, wasn't be very good, a very good parent. 

01:14:40
DR. ALI MARSH So here Mum wasn't a very good parent. So are you able to think that about yourself? 

01:14:45
JULIA It's um. 

01:14:50
DR. ALI MARSH It's hard isn't it? 

01:14:50
JULIA Mmm. 

01:14:50
DR. ALI MARSH It's hard. Maybe just a little chink opening a little bit where you might be able to kind of allow the possibility that maybe you're not a failure, you're not useless. Have you dealt with the things that you kind of learnt because of Mum wasn't a very good parent. 

01:15:10
JULIA Mmm. 

01:15:15
DR. ALI MARSH I know that, that's not enough to stop you believing it because you've been believing it for a long time. 

01:15:20
JULIA And also like my life, I look at my life now. 

01:15:20
DR. ALI MARSH Sure. 

01:15:20
JULIA And it's still. 

01:15:25
DR. ALI MARSH And when you, when you do believe you're useless now in your life, is that still kind of the same sense that Mum said to you. 

01:15:30
JULIA Hmm. 

01:15:30
DR. ALI MARSH How do you feel? 

01:15:30
Mindfulness of emotion 

01:15:35
JULIA Um, well it's usually then I just want to go and use because I just can't. It's, it's, it's. like now, I feel it's too, it's too, um, like I can, like I can feel this burning. This absolute burning of like. 

01:16:00
DR. ALI MARSH It's a burning like when you feel useless? 

01:16:00
JULIA Yeah. 

01:16:00
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

01:16:00
JULIA And so, I just wanna, I just wanna get away. 

01:16:05
DR. ALI MARSH Can you, are you able to stay with that kind of burning feeling that you feel for a moment? And you can, you're feeling it now. Aren't you? 

01:16:10
JULIA Mmm. 

01:16:10
Grounding 

01:16:10
DR. ALI MARSH I can see you rubbing your chest there. Just stay with with, just, just notice it. Notice if it just stays there or it changes in intensity a little bit. No. See if it comes and goes a little bit. Just breathe into it a little bit. Now, you're going there. You still managing to stay with it. Julia? Can you hear me? Julia? 

01:16:35
JULIA Mmm. 

01:16:40
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. Are you still there with me? Or are you dissociating? Are you going away a little bit? 

01:16:45
JULIA Mmm. I can, I can just hear Mum's voice. 

01:16:50
DR. ALI MARSH You can hear Mum's voice. Okay. Just maybe, just look around the room for a moment. Around the room. Okay. Just make yourself realize that you're here with me and you're safe. 

01:17:00
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:17:00
Controlled breathing 

01:17:05
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. Okay. That's great. And now, what about doing just a few deep breathes. That's it, that's great. 

01:17:20
[sil.] 

01:17:20
DR. ALI MARSH That's lovely, okay. That's great. So that, are okay to talk a little bit more about that feeling now? 

01:17:35
JULIA Mmm. 

01:17:35
Review of feelings 

01:17:35
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. I'm, you did really well. Hanging in with it for just a little while. So that feeling, I think that sounds to me, do you, have you got a name for that feeling? 

01:17:50
JULIA Um. Well, I sometimes have this like, um, it's like this little voice. 

01:18:00
DR. ALI MARSH Mm-hmm. 

01:18:00
JULIA Sort of over my shoulder that, you know, it's sort of bit like, you know, it says all the sort of things that. 

01:18:05
DR. ALI MARSH That Mum said. 

01:18:05
JULIA Mum, said, yeah. 

01:18:10
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. And you get that. 

01:18:10
JULIA And I feel really. 

01:18:10
DR. ALI MARSH Burning. I wonder if that's shame? I wonder if that's a feeling of shame? Where you feel really bad about yourself and kind of burning and. What do you? 

01:18:20
JULIA Definitely, feel bad about myself. 

01:18:25
DR. ALI MARSH You feel bad about yourself. Excuse me. 

01:18:25
JULIA And I feel like, you know, it's like shame. Like, like embarrass, like being embarrassed. 

01:18:30
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. Like feeling embarrassed. 

01:18:30
JULIA Yeah 

01:18:30
DR. ALI MARSH Like wanting to hide away. 

01:18:35
JULIA Yeah. or just to get away from it all. 

01:18:35
DR. ALI MARSH Get away from it all. 

01:18:40
JULIA So there's sometimes when I just stay at home and then just go to my bed and just don't want to see anyone or speak to anyone. Because I just think no one would want to be around me. Yeah. 

01:18:50
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

01:18:50
JULIA So there's times when I feel like that. 

01:18:55
DR. ALI MARSH So, and the name for that feeling. What you're describing is shame. So there's a name for a feeling. 

01:19:00
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:19:00
DR. ALI MARSH For you. And it's a very hard feeling to feel isn't it? 

01:19:05
JULIA Mmm, mmm. 

01:19:05
DR. ALI MARSH It's really, really, really hard to stay with. You did really well staying with it for as long as you did then. And then did you notice that we did a little bit of grounding and then some breathing. 

01:19:15
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:19:15
DR. ALI MARSH And how you feeling now? 

01:19:20
JULIA Um, I feel pretty spacey. 

01:19:20
DR. ALI MARSH A little bit spacey still. Okay. Do, I mean were, we've had quite a lot of practice at grounding and breathing. Now do you know what it is that you need to do? 

01:19:30
JULIA Um. 

01:19:30
DR. ALI MARSH Do you need to just ground yourself in the chair there. 

01:19:35
JULIA Can I, yeah. Yeah. Try to. 

01:19:35
DR. ALI MARSH Sitting in the chair there, sitting up and feeling your heels into the ground. 

01:19:40

JULIA Mmm. 

01:20:50
DR. ALI MARSH And tells you you're useless and you're a failure. And it makes you feel really, really ashamed. A lot of shame which we kind of figured out last week. 

01:21:00
JULIA Mmm. 

01:21:05
DR. ALI MARSH It also, and then when you feel all that shame and you want to hide away. You know, you said that, you know, you do hide away. You don't go out, you use. 

01:21:10
JULIA Turn off my phone. 

01:21:10
DR. ALI MARSH Turn off your phone. 

01:21:15
JULIA Mmm. 

01:21:15
DR. ALI MARSH And um, that it also wants to make you use. So in fact that critical voice isn't doing you any favors is it? It's just kind of making things worse. Yeah? 

01:21:25
JULIA Mmm, mmm. 

01:21:25
Cognitive diffusion 

01:21:25
DR. ALI MARSH So we're going to need to do a figurative work on it. Because as we also looked at last week. You allowed that, you know, well actually, you know, Mum used to told me I was useless. Maybe I wasn't useless. And I know you still believe that you are and you know, you do things now with the using, which then makes you feel useless. But then when you, when you say to yourself you're useless then you feel really bad, then you use more. Now, there's something else we can do with that as well. And um, it's got a funny name. It's called cognitive diffusion. 

01:22:00
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:22:00
DR. ALI MARSH So, you know, how when we were talking last week. We were actually challenging you're critical core thoughts. You know, we were saying well, you know, look actually, you know, in fact, you have done okay. And you're critical thoughts aren't quite right. Cognitive diffusion is another way to deal with them. 

01:22:20
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:22:20
DR. ALI MARSH So that instead of challenging them. 

01:22:25
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:22:25
DR. ALI MARSH You just sort of accept that they're habits. 

01:22:25
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:22:30
DR. ALI MARSH And you just acknowledge them, notice them in some way, but don't get caught up in them. So it's a very different way going about it. 

01:22:40
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:22:40
DR. ALI MARSH So, I mean, you've been saying these things to yourself since you were a little girl. 

01:22:40
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:22:40
DR. ALI MARSH Absolutely since you were a little girl. 

01:22:45
JULIA Mmm. 

01:22:45
DR. ALI MARSH So, they, they become a habit. 

01:22:45
JULIA Yeah. 

01:22:45
DR. ALI MARSH And so now, when you find yourself saying, saying to yourself, ah you're useless, you're a failure. You could do, you could notice that. 

01:23:00
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:23:00
DR. ALI MARSH And um, say to yourself, oh, I'm thinking I'm useless and a failure. And that's one thing that you could do. So what cognitive diffusion is actually doing is about, it's about you actually looking at your thoughts instead of being in them. So instead of being, saying I'm useless, I'm a failure. 

01:23:15
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:23:20
DR. ALI MARSH You're saying, oh, I'm thinking. I'll say that I'm thinking that I'm useless and a failure. 

01:23:25
JULIA Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

01:23:25
DR. ALI MARSH I notice that I'm thinking that I'm useless and a failure. And some people actually sing them. And some people go, and this may or may not work for you. It might. Some people, Happy Birthday, seems to be the pretty popular tune to sing them to that you could say, I'm useless and a failure. 

01:23:40
JULIA No. 

01:23:45
DR. ALI MARSH That wouldn't work for you? 

01:23:45
JULIA No. 

01:23:45
DR. ALI MARSH Okay. 

01:23:45
JULIA Mm-mmm. 

01:23:45
DR. ALI MARSH So it's about noticing when you're having the thoughts. That's the first thing. And because you're noticing, the part of you that's noticing is not the thought. 

01:23:55
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:23:55
DR. ALI MARSH So does that make sense to you. Am I explaining it in a way that makes sense? 

01:24:00
JULIA Um, a bit yeah. 

01:24:05
DR. ALI MARSH So, from what I. 

01:24:05
JULIA Yeah. 

01:24:05
DR. ALI MARSH So, from what I said if you start saying to yourself I'm useless and a failure. 

01:24:10
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:24:10
DR. ALI MARSH What are some of the things that you might. What, what might you do with that? 

01:24:15
JULIA Um, I might ah, can say that um, like you said, like that's just um, um, something that I've, it's just become how it is all the time now for me. Because that's what I said for so long and maybe, maybe you know, I need to maybe you know, just um, maybe look at other things to say instead of. 

01:24:45
DR. ALI MARSH You could, you could certainly do that. 

01:24:50
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:24:50
DR. ALI MARSH That's not always so easy though. Because you've been doing it for so, so, you've been doing it for so long. 

01:24:50
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:24:55
DR. ALI MARSH You'll keep happening, you'll keep saying that to yourself. 

01:24:55
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:24:55
DR. ALI MARSH So I guess it's more about it, it, I mean you can certainly look at other things to say. 

01:25:00
JULIA Mmm, mm-hmm. 

01:25:00
DR. ALI MARSH But also it's uh, you need to try to, it's about trying to change you're relationship to the thoughts. 

01:25:05
JULIA Okay. 

01:25:05
DR. ALI MARSH Ah, another thing, some people just say, ah there goes that thought about being useless again. Or they might go, ah thank Mum. 

01:25:15
JULIA Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

01:25:15
DR. ALI MARSH There it goes again. Thanks very much. 

01:25:20
JULIA Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

01:25:20
DR. ALI MARSH Just saying little things like that. Do you see how that puts a little bit of distance between. 

01:25:25
JULIA Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

01:25:25
DR. ALI MARSH You and the thought. 

01:25:25
JULIA Yep. 

01:25:25
DR. ALI MARSH So you might. 

01:25:25
JULIA Maybe I could just try in a week and that's when we'll know. 

01:25:30
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. 

01:25:30
JULIA I feel like, you know, I'm, yeah, I've got, I'm, I'm thinking that. Maybe just could see. 

01:25:35
DR. ALI MARSH Strive. 

01:25:35
JULIA Yeah. 

01:25:40
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. Should we write some of those things down. Some of the things that you might like to try. 

01:25:40
JULIA Mm-hmm. 

01:25:45
DR. ALI MARSH So, so you said you might like to try, which ones do you think you might like to try? 

01:25:50
JULIA Um, mmm. 

01:25:50
DR. ALI MARSH Do you remember this. 

01:25:50
JULIA I'd be saying things like, mmm, this is just a bad habit. 

01:25:55
DR. ALI MARSH This is just a bad habit. Yeah. 

01:25:55
JULIA Yeah. Um, and maybe something like um, as I said, saying something into it like, just because um, I have, I haven't done a lot with my life doesn't mean that I'm useless. 

01:26:15
DR. ALI MARSH Mm-hmm. Okay. And perhaps a couple of them. 

01:26:20
JULIA And the other thing is that word, you said, about just, just um, hearing it and then just saying that just, just um, those, those words that Mum used to say. 

01:26:40
DR. ALI MARSH Just those words Mum uses to say. Oh, that's a good one. Yeah. And can I chuck in there something really short like, Oh, thanks Mum. Or, does that appeal to you? 

01:26:55
JULIA No, but, but what about something like um, I'm not, I'm not going to listen. 

01:27:00
DR. ALI MARSH I'm not going to listen. Oh, well, I'm not going to listen. 

01:27:00
JULIA Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

01:27:05
DR. ALI MARSH Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, there's somethings for you to try during the week. 

01:27:15
JULIA Mm-hmm.
