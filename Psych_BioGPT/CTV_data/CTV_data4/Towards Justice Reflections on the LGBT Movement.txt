THE 11TH ANNUAL SOCIAL JUSTICE ACTION AWARD ADDRESS Towards Justice: Reflections on the LGBT Movement Urvashi Vaid, J.D. Columbia University, New York, NY 

00:00:35
UNKNOWN For the past several years we've been pleased to offer the Social Justice Action Award, and the name of this award is actually quite conscious. "Social Justice," of course, refers to centering the voices and experiences of those of us who have been marginalized and denied access to important resources as basic as food, housing, and work to more broad concerns affecting civil rights and social policies. Social injustice occurs at many levels towards many people based on race, ethnicity, gender, gender diversity, sexual orientation, disabilities, religion, and sadly, the list goes on. In order to change this, of course, requires action. And the fight for social justice must be waged on many levels at once, because simply said, all humans matter and their voices, our voices, must be heard. Which brings me to our award winner today, Urvashi Vaid. That, I've been practicing all day! Urvashi Vaid, an organizer, attorney, and writer whose work in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender movements and social justice movements spans three decades. Her impact through words and actions has been enormous, and her range of activities includes being a leader of the National Lesbian and Gay Task Force, executive director of the philanthropic organization Arcus Foundation, director of the Engaging Tradition Project at the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law at Columbia Law School, and a cofounder of the first ever lesbian super PAC, LPAC. Watch out, Karl Rove. And of course, if that's not enough, Vaid is also the author/editor of several books including Irresistible Revolution: Confronting Race, Class, and the Assumptions of LGBT Politics. And then with John D'Emilio and William Turner, an anthology titled "Creating Change: Public Policy, Sexuality, and Civil Rights." Now, I do have some personal recollections for, of Urvashi, even though I've only just met her today. You know, she became really well known some 20-plus years ago when she made a speech at the 1993 march on Washington. I was there. I was a newly-out graduate student, just come out to another friend, a coworker. We went together, we hopped in the car and said, "Let's go!" Um, and I was just making a few tentative steps into the social world, which I've never looked back from, by the way. And I was just simply lucky enough to be there whenever she came to the podium to speak her powerful words. And I'm just gonna say a few lines, 'cuz they still resonate deeply today. "America, this day marks the end from exile of the gay and lesbian people. We are banished no more. We wander the wilderness of despair no more. We are afraid no more. For on this day with love in our hearts we have come out and we have come out across America to build a bridge of understanding, a bridge of progress, a bridge as solid as steel, a bridge to a land where no one suffers prejudice because of their sexual orientation, their race, their gender, their religion, or their human difference." What can I say? I was so moved in that moment. I felt myself immediately become a part of a larger whole, inspired in an instant about who I could be, who I must become, what I must do with my life, simply by seeing and hearing who Urvashi was and still is, the power of her voice, her vision, her spirit, by listening to the strength of your words and your will to change for justice. And so now, here we are, some years down the road, and as I reflected on the theme of our conference this year, who else could come to mind? Because Urvashi Vaid, your understanding of justice for all means simply that. All people, all times, all places.

URVASHI VAID Wow, that was beautiful. And, um, and very touching, and I wanna thank you so much for, um, this and I wanna thank the roundtable for this award and all of you, you legions, for being here at the end of your conference. Um, it's a, it's, it's, to say a personal thing about the award, it's lovely to get it because psychologists are actually close to my heart. My sister is a psychologist. I was visiting her this week and my parents who live with her out in Texas. She teaches at Texas A&M. She's a psycholinguist. Jyotsna Vaid. And, um, I couldn't get back in time for the regular presentation of this last night because the plane was canceled. So I thought I'd talk to you just briefly today about the, um, LGBT movement, where it is, some of the challenges it faces. And thanks again. The great American lesbian feminist poet Adrienne Rich, who died in March of 2012, captured the spirit of the queer and feminist movement of the 1970s into which I came out. In her masterpiece, 21 Love Poems, she wrote, "The rules break like a thermometer. Quicksilver spills across the charted systems. We're out in a country that has no language, no laws. Whatever we do together is pure invention. The maps they gave us were out of date by years." She identified a sense that we all shared back then as feminists and as queer people that everything we were doing was uncharted, outside of the rules. There were no maps, there was no language, and there was so much shame and repression. And, you know, to refuse the compulsory heterosexuality into which we were channeled, to begin to create feminist and openly lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender lives was an act of pure invention. These days, I worry that the new maps we created over the past 40 years are themselves outdated, operating as they do from fading scripts of identity, community, political economy, oppositional politics, and a changed economic and political order brought about by global dominance of neoliberal policies. The script of identity-based organizing, for example, has created more space and power for trans and queer people, for people of color, for women, but it has not yet displaced the political and economic control exercised by older identities derived from patriarchy, from religious tradition, from nationality or economic status. Community has been fragmented by the portability of labor, by technology, by neoliberal disinvestment in public services and infrastructure so that civic community life is quite different today from the modes in place when community organizing methodology were created by Saul Alinsky. Yet we still use those old methodologies, and it has the effect, in my mind, of allowing progressive social movements to appear more nostalgic than visionary, pursuing an old image of participation that flickers like a candle on the verge of being extinguished by the current control of all politics by wealthy corporate industrialists. A new economic vision still eludes the LGBT movement and still for most, uh, U.S. progressive movements, it's elusive. All of us find ourselves compromised by and beholden to capitalism's siren song. Even our opposition to social norms has taken an ironic turn. Instead of breaking rules, the feminist and LGBT movements have become invested in living within them, seeking respectability, still living within the same structures of nuclear families that I thought I was gonna smash when I, when I was in my teens, um, still operating from the same scripts of motherhood, fatherhood, and parenting that our parents did, clinging to the delusion of monogamous marriage. And 50 years after the feminist revolution, at least this wave of it, seeing big public fights between feminists about whether a "good mother" can work outside the home and have kids. That Anne-Marie Slaughter thing was ridiculous. I couldn't believe I was listening to it. I thought like, it was in the 50s. So I speak to you from this ambivalent place, a participant and a worker in several movements who takes great pride in the gains we've made, yet finds the work we've done incomplete and its future not at all assured. Um, so, you know, I mean, I don't wanna deny that there's enormous progress to celebrate in the LGBT movement, but I'm ambivalent, in part, because I still think that we are operating in ways that aren't challenging the fundamental, uh, power structure. So, you know, we, we, we, queer momentum is so evident today in everything that it's almost redundant to repeat what we've achieved. Since the Windsor case was decided in June of 2013, there've been at least 11 federal court decisions on marriage that have been positive, two states have passed laws, and progress has been made on a number of issues. So queer momentum is evident in public opinion polls that have shifted, it's evident in the religious shifts that are happening in many religious denominations, it's evident in the global movement that exists. Um, despite the repression, there are, uh, LGBT people, queer people, and allies organizing in every country against repression. And there's demographic changes that makes everybody optimistic, because everywhere you go, younger people have different attitudes than people of my generation and older. And that's a really positive sign. Um, when I think about, the question I get asked most these days is, "Well, how did this happen?" And it's often asked by people who haven't been clued in to, in the ways that I think many of you have been, through your work and your scholarship and your activism. But I think when I, when you, you know, I try, so I've tried to crystallize some ideas about how I think it happened, "it" being this shift and this progress, right? So I think we did eight specific strategies that helped the LGBT movement advance, and I wanna share them with you and then talk a little bit some of the unintended, unintended effects and pitfalls that these strategies also brought along with them. First was that we built the movement out of crisis and out of a series of crises. Like many other social movements, the LGBT movement built itself out of, uh, repression, crises, opposition, structural barriers, illegalization. We faced four arguments against homosexuality, that we were sick, that we were criminal, that we were immoral, that we were sinful. And we have had to refute each of those arguments, and we're still engaged in those fights in many ways. Each argument created a crisis that we organized around. So, you know, the modern LGBT movement in the U.S. was built in the 50s and 60s in reaction to the combined crises created by medical ignorance, societal stigma, and government persecution. Police harassment and criminalization were at the root of a lot of the movement's work in the 50s and 60s and 70s, and indeed united the Stonewall Riots, that police harassment did. Criminalization was eliminated only in 2003 through the Lawrence v. Texas case. Very, very recently. And the persecution of parts of our community, uh, particularly the over-criminalization of people of color, the over-criminalization of, uh, young queer people and trans people continues to this day, as, along with the similar challenges, uh, faced by, uh, other communities of color too. So in recent times it's been the crisis of the Republican Party's hostility and the religious right's campaigns against marriage and the global backlash against LGBT rights that have motivated and mobilized people. I bring these crises up because they're not just outside. The crises experienced by LGBT people begin quite personally and they required of us a transformation of self even before we could transform society, to counter the incredible shame and stigma associated with being gay. Bayard Rustin identified this aspect of the movement in a brilliant talk he gave in 1986 titled "From Montgomery to Stonewall." He noted, "There are four burdens which gays, along with every despised group, whether it's Blacks following slavery and Reconstruction, or Jews fearful of Germany, must address. The first is to recognize that one must overcome fear. The second is overcoming self-hate. The third is overcoming self-denial. The fourth burden is more political. It is to recognize that our job is not to get those people who dislike us to love us, but rather to control the extent to which people can publically manifest anti-gay sentiment." I think those are very wise words and I think that's the kind of path that the LGBT movement in some ways has followed, although I would dispute, I think many of us still try to get everybody to love us, um, and don't just accept that some, in some ways, everybody isn't gonna love us. That's what I feel. So I think it's important to remember the depth of this cultural stigmatization because it's not disappeared. You can see its impact in the high levels of youth suicide. You can see its impact, uh, I think, in part, this is, this stigmatization, despite the, the legal changes that I mentioned, uh, is the reason why the LGBT movement remains so mobilized, because we continue to experience family rejection, religious intolerance, government bigotry, and internalized shame. And these are real motivators to, to building a resistance movement and to activism. The second strategy we used was we used the law. And clearly, the present victories of the movement are most directly attributable to this aggressive and consciously articulated legal strategy. But the law is not a revolutionary tool. Ugh, yeah, wow, shocking, right, to hear a lawyer say that, right? Lawsuits and court decisions have a unique ability to focus the societal conversation and to determine public discourse. Their value is also structural. The court decisions create a framework within which social and political order is lived. But litigation and court decisions are much, as much a form of limitation as they are of transcendence and change. Lawyers are like architects. We draft plans, we submit renovations to existing, preexisting structures that are determined by legislative and judicial bodies. The plan may be inventive or even visionary in its proposed use of space, its form, its materials, its narrative, but it is bounded by the limitations of the space it seeks to transform. Law, in my experience, is the ultimate tool of conformity and containment. So the impact of the movement's reliance on law as its primary avenue of work has been the loss of its radical visioning and its dreaming energy. And, and the parts where you see a different kind of movement exist than the legal and political arm of the gay movement in which I've worked myself, is in the cultural realm, what I'll call the third strategy, the cultural and media strategy. Now, we didn't just use law to get to this point, and that's, I would submit that's part of the reason we have come so far. To tackle prejudice, we had to do more than litigate. We had to try to change cultural perceptions and representations. So the first wave of activism challenged medical and pejorative labeling of homosexuality as a mental illness. It countered the negative images of LGBT people by using coming out as an imperative political act. And it used art and poetry and music and theater and film as, to create, to create an archive of queer experience that could counter invisibility and cultural ignorance. It organized through religious denominations, through schools and workplaces, non-legal realms where it was possible to do a different kind of change work, to change policies, to do education, to build support between people. So I think that, you know, uh, the politics that focuses only on legal change is, is, is never successful for any social movement. You have to do cultural work, and the cultural change has, the cultural change strategy that we've used has been a conscious one. I would argue it's been less invested in the political and legal strategy and, uh, but it's, it's been just as effective. Um, the fourth, uh, strategy we used is perhaps, for an activist, the most miraculous strategic achievement of the gay movement, or the LGBT movement. You know what it's been? Coordination. Despite the ideological diversity and the fact that the organizational chart of the LGBT movement looks like the Milky Way Galaxy, right? I've often said that. It's like the Milky Way Galaxy, just all over the place. The movement, by 2000, had evolved a clear and shared basic equal rights agenda at the federal, state, and local level. And the coordination of strategies, of groups working on this agenda, was achieved through the deliberate creation of networks and conferences and associations like the National Association of Community Centers or the Federation of Statewide LGBT Organizations or, you know, the National Policy Roundtable or the Religious Leadership Roundtable. These little bodies made a huge difference in a previously fractured and uncoordinated and unaligned movement. And so you had everybody kind of pulling together for a basic rights agenda, and that's an achievement for, um, the movement that I walked into where you couldn't get five people to agree to walk out of the room together. Um, the, the fifth area, the fifth important change, I think, has been the local and state focus. And one of the biggest challenges the LGBT movement made in, one of the biggest changes we made in the late 80s and early 90s was to shift our focus to work in state legislatures, in cities, and local communities, shift away from the federal. We'd spent a lot of time at the federal level because of the AIDS epidemic and the HIV epidemic requited, required a federal response. But the shift in resources and focus from the federal to the state paid huge dividends. The states, in state legislatures, ironically enough, is where we've seen, uh, the passage of, uh, anti-discrimination laws and, of course, more recently, the passage of marriage equality laws. The pitfall here has been that resources have been unevenly available for the state work. So in Southern states where organizing, education, and lobbying are happening, they have the fewest resources. Um, the sixth, seventh, and eighth strategies I just wanna quickly mention are allies and coalitions; no social movement can do it alone. And it's changed and we've got more allies. The seventh strategy is targeting bipartisanship. You know, that's what, what I, what I mean by that, and I feel very ambivalent about it, as a Lefty, the targeted bipartisanship has been that, um, since the 1990s the LGBT movement made a conscious choice to appeal to and split off moderate Republicans who support LGBT equality from the right wing of the Republican Party. This has been a successful strategy. Uh, because of the growth of the Libertarian wing of the Republican Party, because of the impact of openly lesbian, gay, bi, trans children of prominent Republican leaders, the power structure of the Republican establishment has been changing its views. Now, this is not uniform, and certainly parties in Texas and South Carolina which are more right-leaning haven't changed, and the mainstream of the party still struggles, but the establishment is changing, and it's been consciously lobbied to change. My ambivalence about these strategies is that I think sometimes the desire to win this mainstream support, the desire to get a few moderate Republicans to vote with us to pass a bill has resulted sometimes in uncritical and cynical embrace of conservative family values rhetoric and an endorsement of the right wing's claims about the centrality of the nuclear two-parent family. The smart strategy of allying with anti-choice, anti-labor, anti-Obama donors and organizations like the Koch brothers or Paul Singer, who are all pro-LGBT, hurts women, it hurts people of color, and poor people. And it hurts parts of our communities. And yet, in the name of bipartisanship, this is portrayed as very smart politics. And I can, so let's discuss afterwards the dilemma of smart politics. All right? How smart is a short-term politics? The final strategy has been that, uh, the queer movement organized the money, um, both for its, uh, charitable organizations and for the political strategy. It got seriously political. What I mean by that, as somebody who spent 10 years working in philanthropic organizations, you know, .01% or some ridiculously low amount of money of all charitable giving in the United States goes to LGBT. This is what I'm talking about, like the major institutions like Rockefeller, MacArthur, Kellogg, they don't give anything to LGBT organizations, really. Ford does. And they're a, uh, anomaly among the major foundations. So most of the funding has come from people who volunteer in the movement, and volunteering their time, giving the $25 to join the Task Force, and things like that. Um, and the, and it's also come from a handful of wealthy individuals who therefore have some disproportionate impact on the politics of the movement but have done some many, many good things. So these are the eight ways that we got here, right? So what are some of the challenges we face, and then I'll wrap up. You still with me? Good. I think the biggest challenge we face has been well articulated by the wonderful transgender legal scholar and activist Dean Spade, and that's the challenge of differentiating between legal rights and legal equality and actual life and lived equality, right? The conviction that legal reform will change people's lived experience rests on the assumption that formal legal equality is synonymous with winning and that rights, once achieved, will be evenly distributed or experienced by all parts of the community. As legal scholar Dean Spade writes, "Declarations of legal equality by the state leave in place the conditions that actually produce the disproportionate poverty, criminalization, imprisonment, deportation, and violence that trans and LGBT people face while papering it over with a veneer of fairness. Equal rights and equal protection can be granted without disturbing some of the hierarchies, institutions, or traditions that perpetuate the idea that LGBT difference is unnatural, is wrong, is harmful to society. Um, if it sets its sights only on inclusion into legal rights regimes, the LGBT movement, in effect, asks no more than the right to be equal within a structurally unfair racist system." This is a challenge that movements that have come before us have experienced too. After the passage of the 1964 and 1965 Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, the Civil Rights leader A. Philip Randolph observed that the movement at that time suffered from what he called, quote, "the curse of victory," unquote, in which equal rights had been achieved, but, quote, "Blacks still were not equal in fact." Formal equal rights, he argued, was, were a crucial first step, but next had to come the struggle for Black empowerment, economic freedom, and respect. The achievement of Civil Rights actually made the gap between formal and substantive equality even clearer. And I think the women's movement has experienced something like this. It had won, since the 80s, it's won most of the formal legal gains it sought except for the federal equal rights amendment. These achievements have created opportunities for women, and over time they have changed some cultural attitudes. However, 30-plus years later, formal equality for women has not removed the glass ceiling for women in top jobs. It's not transformed women's role in families enough. It's not produced equal pay for equal work, and the disparity only, you know, with the disparity continuing to be highest when race is factored in. It's not brought an end to violence against women by producing a new respect for women's sexual and reproductive autonomy. So another challenge, another kind of challenge, so this is a challenge between legal equality and lived experienced, and focusing on the lived experience of LGBT people would require the LGBT movement to focus much more on economic policy in the next few years, on, um, the, the criminal justice policy and the disparate impact that that has, and so on. That's my argument. But another kind of challenge the movement faces is a need to see beyond the success or failure of a particular issue to this larger structural change. So a friend of mine recently said to me that when marriage equality was won in his state, you know, the movement's work there would pretty much be done. And, and he, so my friend's comment exposes one of the most detrimental aspects of the marriage equality movement. Too many people see it as the end point of gay rights. In fact, when seen from the perspective of how winning marriage equality in general has impacted the life and the life, lives and the life chances of all parts of our community, the drive for marriage equality has been distracting. It's built a movement, and I love it, the movement that it's built, but there are so many, marriage equality has become the gay movement's abortion issue, a sign post of freedom, an issue that has a large symbolic meaning because it redefines key traditions of sex and gender, but like abortion, same sex marriage, um, has resulted in the movement relying, being defined by what's happening in that realm. And it's come to dominate our movement the way abortion dominated the women's movement. So what I think we can learn from the impact of that dominance in the women's movement is that, you know, even though the women's movement secured abortion rights in the early 70s through a Supreme Court decision and in the same era achieved many legal reforms, poor women immediately suffered in the passage of the Hyde Amendment, which denied public funding for abortions. The rights won were unevenly distributed by rates, race and economic status. The movement lost the ERA fight, but instead of settling in to win the gains for all women, to push even further, the movement demobilized after the abortion victory, in my opinion. Large legal infrastructures came to substitute for activism. A grassroots women of color-focused and led movement worked on reproductive justice, on violence against women, on workers' rights, on sex work and trafficking, on economic equity, but these leaders and organizations were not the mainstream voice or the mainstream focus of the women's movement. As a consequence, the women's movement has spent the last 50 years defending against attacks while seeing its infrastructure get weaker. I think a focus on winning or losing one particular issue is a real problem for any social movement. One issue is not the fullness of what we need to change to create a space for LGBT people to self-determine and live freely. Um, in my book, Irresistible Revolution, I talk about the assumptions of LGBT politics that have inhibited it from taking up issues of race and economic inequality. On a practical level, the problem stems from who runs and controls the movement, and I talk about that. But on a deeper level, um, confronting racism and class in the society and in the movement requires activists to work in different ways, to abandon their own investment in the structures that have won us partial satisfaction. This is really hard to do. And a story illustrates this point. So I was talking with two gay men who were both very generous donors to the LGBT movement with whom I've worked for many years and whom I really like and respect. I told them about a conference I'd attended of LGBT people of color-led organizations. I said, you know, there were incredible leaders and incredible ideas and practical organizing that they were doing to address issues of survival and care and poverty policy, issues that many of the national queer groups just don't address deeply enough. And I was arguing that, you know, this is like the part of the movement that in cities which are working with like, youth shelters or homeless youth or HIV groups, whatever, that that's where we really need to focus, 'cuz they were touching lives and populations that this part of the movement just didn't get to. So my friends listened politely to me and one of them observed, "You know, I wonder if this just doesn't resonate with us because, as an affluent gay man, it's not something I think about on my own." And he asked his friend, "What would it mean for you and me to be moved by this work? How would we have to see and feel it and touch it? What would make the intellectual and emotional connection and enable us to commit large amounts of resources?" And this was a genuine conversation. And my other friend paused and said, "Well, I'd certainly have to see it and feel it and touch it, but I still think it's not the kind of work I'm inclined towards because it involves a subset, and I'm more interested in work that's not focused towards a particular subset." So I observed that gay white men were a subset too, although they didn't see themselves as such, perhaps, and that instead of seeing one as a superset and the other as a subset or this generic LGBT work as a superset and LGBT work that affects colored people or poor people as a subset, we, I found it more useful to get more precise about what we were trying to accomplish. So if our organizing, if our efforts were ensuring queer survival and getting to the distribution of life chances and opportunity to all parts of our community, then the question on working on poverty or on racial justice would not be seen as a side show but it would be part of the main event because those are barriers to people having, to their life chances and to their opportunity to live a queer, free life. So, I mean, they saw that when I explained it this way. So it wasn't like a fight, but it was just a, uh, the conversation revealed to me yet again the way that, uh, the donors to the LGBT movement and by extension the organizations they fund have divorced race and, and economic inequality, and even gender from the project of gay rights. It's not how you all are framing the issues here, but it's, there's still a disconnect between the intersectional approach and the practice. So building movements that have poor people at their center and at their leadership is an achievement that neither the women's movement nor the LGBT movement can claim, I don't think. Uh, to do this work would require the movement to change the definition for whom it's fighting and to expand the goals for which it's organized, to go through a lot of examination of leadership and how we change the structures and norms of our nonprofit organizations, how there's a built-in elitism to them. There's all sorts of issues that come up if you start to think about how do we place poor people or people most affected by the problems we're trying to address at the leadership of our movement? It's, it's, it's, so a justice-seeking movement, in my mind, would, uh, be focused on ensuring the survival of all members of its community. It would strive to end income inequality, violence, and poverty. It would work against the racial inequalities that are the legacies of racism and colonialism. It would foreground projects like criminal justice sentencing reform and disproportionate policing and incarceration. It would work again on prisons and jails, like we used to back in the 70s and the 60s and some people still are. It would work on disparities in healthcare access and care, HIV and AIDS criminalization, wider access to treatment, the way the educational system targets and stigmatizes youth of color. The good news is that this movement is here. There are queer groups and scholars and activists working, writing, thinking, building this part of the movement. And what we need is for this part of the movement to be the $40 million organization and not the $40 million organization of HRC which doesn't work on these issues, although they do good things. They do not work on this agenda. They wouldn't be opposed to it, but $40 million a year is not deployed to this. And that's what I think is a problem. When that happens, I'm gonna be dancing. A very happy jig. So, you know, I have many more things I could say to you, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna just stop. Um, there was another challenge that I, that I didn't really outline, uh, in my talk, and that this the, the challenge that right-wing fundamentalist movements continue to pose to the LGBT movement. Um, and what's interesting is, in my thinking I've come to understand much more, I've been thinking about why people are drawn to the right and what is it about the right wing and its, its, uh, elevation of tradition and traditional culture and traditional family, why do these appeals mean so much to people, and that's part of what I'm working on in this Engaging Tradition Project and I hope to, to write more about, um, but I think we can't just treat the right as, um, the enemy. I mean, in many ways they are the enemy of everything I believe in. But the people who follow the right, the ordinary people are not our enemies in any way whatsoever. They're, they're, they're turning to answers for real problems that they're experiencing in their lives. So the Association of Women in International Development, this great network, did a survey a few, they have a, they have a Confronting Religious Fundamentalisms project, and they did a survey of about 1,600 organizations all over the world that are women's groups, various countries, and asked how these women's rights activists were facing fundamentalisms. And they identified several factors that contributed to the rise of religious fundamentalism, according to these activists. The first was that economic factors like income inequality and poverty, the failure of state institutions and services, actually creates an opening for people who are speaking to people's needs and resentments and anger about inequality. So religious movements, fundamentalist movements, um, often provide care and support and services for people in crisis and people in need. They're there to pick up the slack when the government is too corrupt or when the government systems are inadequate. So in fact, neoliberal economic policies which favor privatization of government services have actually created an increased growth for religious institutions. That's one thing they found. The second thing they found was that political factors contribute to the growth of religious fundamentalisms. In some cases, state actors link with religious institutions to preserve power. You can see that in Russia. Putin and his alliance with the, the Orthodox, Russian Orthodox Church is a very deliberate political alliance to build power, the power of the state, in a domain that he didn't have. In other instances, religious fundamentalism presents itself as a reformist, outsider force because politics is so corrupt. And it's true, it is. And here, here especially. Um, you know, we see it in a different light here than we might see it in India, for example, but it's corrupt. Um, third set of things that the, uh, Association of Women in International Development found was that social factors implicate the growth of the power of religious fundamentalism, which include the rise of religiosity among people, which is part of a search for meaning and community, for identity and belonging, a refuge from the anxiety people feel about technological and climate and cultural change. You know, people, so people are, I guess my point is that when I read this sort of look I thought, "Wow, this is really helpful because it helps me to see why the turn to these kinds of, uh, movements happens. And then how do we respond? What counter vision do we offer? And how can we think about, you know, that?" So that leads me back to this whole idea that, that you need to provide services, you need to take care of people, you need to have, you know, a way to counter this kind of, uh, political moment that we're in where the state is supposed to shrink to be able to be drowned in a bathtub, as Grover Norquist, who is the American right wing, one of the leaders of the American right wing, uh, has said. All right. So there you have it. And, uh, so I basically come out where, um, Dr. King did in his time to break silence talk when he said, "I'm convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin to shift from a thing-oriented society to a person-oriented society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered." So, to me, the work ahead for the LGBT movement is to work on the giant triplets of racism, materialism, and militarism, which are the obstacles to freedom and gender justice. Thank you.

URVASHI VAID I think today you're seeing intersectional movements. Occupy Wall Street was one, 'cuz it looked at the, um, uh, the issue, I mean, it was raising the issue of inequality and wealth and control, but it was bringing in everything. And, um, I think the immigrant rights movement is another great example, which is focused on immigrant rights but is talking about, you know, sexuality and, and anti-Black racism, and it's talking about women's rights. It's really talking about a lot of issues. So I think, yes, in some ways, the examples I'm using date me and are, I mean, I think are generationally interesting to think about, and that today's movements are more hybrid. Um, the, the thing that I, I think is still a challenge for today's movements is, um, political power. And so, 'cuz, 'cuz I think that there is an anti-politics dimension to much of today's grassroots activism sometimes. And it's not just today's grassroots; it was there for years in, in every era that I've been part of movements. There's people who are like, "Ugh, it's corrupt, it sucks! I don't wanna get involved." But then you don't have the people in place to push. So I mean, I hope that it's gonna make a difference that de Blasio is mayor of New York. I think so. And I think it would've made a difference if Chris Quinn were mayor. I think it would've been, you know, so I do think it matters when you have folks able to, uh, direct the resources of government, which are significant, you know, to, to in different ways. So I'm answering your question by saying, yeah, you're right, that, that the, um, there's, there's a bunch of movements that one could look at that are contemporary movements. Um, and I think the whole, part of what I'm interested in and, uh, is what are the new ways that we oughta invent movements? You know, so some people that I know are working very actively on building online social movements. There's a group called Purpose, um, that has a website called Avaaz. They do the website all out. They really build, they have, you know, mobilized lots of people all over the world through, um, social media. It's, I see the value of that, but I'm, there's this older part of me that thinks, "Well, is that the same as face to face, in the street?" You know, occupying Wall Street, it wasn't just a virtual movement, it was a physical thing. 

00:43:45
UNKNOWN I was interested in your, um, analogy of using, um abortion and, as the, as the touchstone issue for the women's movement and, um, marriage equality for the gay, gay, LGBT movement. I think that the, certainly marriage equality touches a little bit more on, you know, what is the core of, of what is being gay, which is to, to love someone of another, you know, of the same gender and to have that recognized, um, legally. So that's, it's, it's very important. But you're right that it's not the only issue. So what, how do you see other issues coming in, 'cuz I do have young people that I work with, um, as students, and they say, you know, they either say, "Okay, it's done once we get marriage equality," or they say, "Well, I, you know, I don't plan to get married, and I don't believe in having children, so where does that leave me as a, as a lesbian?" So where do you see some of the other issues coming in? How could we bring those issues in? 

00:44:45
URVASHI VAID Again, I think they come in through, um, thinking about, uh, the, uh, different part, thinking about the LGBT communities as, as, uh, through a economic lens and through a racial and gendered lens. So the realities of transgender people in our communities are really different than the reality of cisgendered lesbians like me. You know, the reality of a middle class, upper middle class person like me is really different from somebody who's, you know, trying to support a family on, you know, minimum wage. And I think that get, by getting more specific about who we are as community, as communities and then focusing energy on what the needs of those different parts of our communities are, and clear agendas emerge. And that's why I say, you know, groups like, um, FIERCE, which works here with young people or, uh, the Audrey Lorde Project, which does community organizing in Bed Stuy and communities, uh, trying to work with LGBT people of color or Streetwise and Safe, which works with, um, youth that are experiencing over-policing and educates youth to fight back, um, are doing a different kind, they're doing, you know, they're reaching a different kind of population than, um, you know, an HRC with a dinner that has 1,000 people paying $250 to support national lobbying and worthwhile things, but, you know, there's that. And then right now we're in a moment where, um, the service parts of our communities, the parts of our communities that are concerned with care and survival are actually really struggling for funding because of the cutbacks in public funding and the lack of, you know, private response there. 

00:46:50
UNKNOWN All right, so one of the unique things we do when we give awards here is that we, in addition to giving a nice shiny plaque, which we do have, we also like to gather stories, commentaries, um, from people in, in our award winners' lives of the impact that you've had on them. And so I have a statement I want to read. 

00:47:15
URVASHI VAID It's called a public shaming by psychologists. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN I hope not. I think you'll like it. 

00:47:20
URVASHI VAID That's very sweet, actually. 

00:47:20
UNKNOWN Okay. Urvashi, you have spent a lifetime organizing, writing, inspiring, and leading for change and justice. Whether on the ramparts leading the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, litigating at the ACLU National Prison Project, devising innovative change in the field of grant making at the Ford and Arcus Foundations, teaching a seminar at Columbia, or agitating in Washington, Boston, New York, or Kalamazoo, you always inspired and pushed us all for more to be our better selves, to stretch and yearn in spite of ourselves. You do all this with charm, good humor, and an easy laugh, which makes our journey to justice seem within our reach. There is no one more, more experienced or respected among social movement leaders than you and no one who has consistently challenged our thinking and pushed us in bold, even uncomfortable, directions. From your early work on criminal justice and prison reforms to your iconic position in the LGBT movement to your current work challenging the limitations of tradition, you've been a passionate thought leader. For many of us people of color contemplating social justice work on multiple fronts, you've been a unique and sometimes only role model, a South Asian woman, an immigrant, queer, and deeply committed to all forms of justice. You blazed a trail through the 1980s and 90s, and now there are thousands of affective South Asian American leaders across the nation shaking things up. You've been a friend, a sister, a mentor, a challenger at all the points for those of us who needed just that person. In the 1980s as you marched across Central Park South at Pride, you came over to the curb to urge others to step in solidarity and start marching. Over the years, your paths have crossed again with those of us who you've inspired. For example, at the UN conference on the status of women in Beijing when you focused on positioning lesbian advocacy within the larger global women's movement. To reencounter you as a colleague has been a, a remarkable gift. You've quoted Adrienne Rich in framing our social justice movement. "Whatever we do together is pure invention. The maps they gave us were out of date by years." Urvashi, as you've called us to invent our irresistible revolution, you are a lodestar for anyone who seeks to chart a course to a better world for queer folks. For those of us who hope to contribute to this quest through organizational leadership, we turn to you and your writings time and time again as we face forks in the road and seek to make the best choices we can. We are so lucky to have the benefit of your enthusiasm, your encouragement, your critique, and your vital presence. We send our deepest admiration and congratulations to you, our friend and colleague. There are so few individuals in any field who have your intellect, your passion, your drive, your humanity. Simply said, we wish we could clone you. You're one of the most passionate, insightful, brilliant, and hilarious activists and scholars we have in the world. If there weren't you, we'd have to reinvent you. 

00:50:50
URVASHI VAID Wow. 

00:50:50
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:50:50
URVASHI VAID Thanks. Thank you so much. That's really sweet!

00:51:05
UNKNOWN This is the fancy, the fancy form there. 

00:51:05
URVASHI VAID Wow. They actually, uh, go out and ask people I've worked with for comments and then beautifully put it together. That's really neat. 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN And then the fancy plaque. 

00:51:20
URVASHI VAID Wow! 

00:51:20
UNKNOWN There you go. Two for one. 

00:51:20
URVASHI VAID God. 

00:51:20
UNKNOWN Congratulations. 

00:51:20
URVASHI VAID Thank you.
