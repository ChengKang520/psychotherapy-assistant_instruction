Please join me in welcoming this dynamic team, Dr. Cortman and Dr. Shinitzky. 

00:02:40
Harold ShinitzkyThank you. 

00:02:40
CHRIS CORTMAN Thank you very much for all of those introductions. Show of hands, how many of you were here last year? Wow, and received the book? Keep your hands up, actually read the book, changed your life, got like one hand. Thank you so much Mom. You may also remember from last year's presentation that I made a joke about Dr. Coleman getting two hours to present while I only had one. Well, I found out that was a huge mistake because this year now, I have to talk for two hours and so, yeah. So you won't hear any jokes about performing for an all-day seminar this year. That's--but this year, I brought along with co-author, my good friend, very, very impressive man, Dr. Harold Shinitzky. I enjoy working so much with Dr. Shinitzky because we really have such contrasting styles. For instance, Dr. Shinitzky is from the mid-west and I hail from New Jersey. He's a Cub's fan, while I'm a Yankee fan. 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Yeah! 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Boo! 

00:04:15
CHRIS CORTMAN You either love us or hate us. Dr. Shinitzky is Jewish and I'm Christian. He's tall, dark, handsome, intelligent and I'm sorry I went down that road. But I, I will tell you that in 1972, Dr. Shinitsky was 63 inches tall and I was 64 inches tall and then I stopped trying. If I appear a little bit tired today, please forgive me. I need to tell you what happened last night. Shinitzky slept over at my house because we had to present here today and we were getting ready in the morning, or last night for this morning. Well, my three-year old daughter, Melina, just had a birthday and her mother had this great idea that when a child turns three they need to give up their pacifier. So she came up with this elaborate story of a paci-fairy and wrote this really nice letter. And the paci-fairy said that thank you so much Melina for giving up your pacifier because I'm going to take it now to all the little babies who need it. And it just seemed so sweet. But I need to tell you that the last week has been hell. I now know there is no addiction tougher than the paci. And so last night, Melina came, or Melina cried, three different times, Dadda, Dadda, I want my paci, I want my paci. And I finally was able to write this little lullaby with her, which has disappeared completely from my notes. But that's okay, I'll try--you stole my . . . 

00:06:25
UNKNOWN Stole it. 

00:06:30
CHRIS CORTMAN You had four chances to introduce us. 

00:06:35
HAROLD SHINITZKY Talk about adding stress. 

00:06:35
CHRIS CORTMAN Here is a stress presentation and my notes are gone! 

00:06:45
UNKNOWN Take number three. 

00:06:50
CHRIS CORTMAN Would you care to hear my lullaby from last night? I was afraid you'd say that. It's called Ode to Paci. [music]Hush little angel, please no drama. Get back in your crib with your Elmo pajamas. Next time you cry please ask for your Mama. If she doesn't come, then call Obama. Now it's the third time you've called me to the room that you're in, this cold turkey is tougher than heroin. It's time to say goodbye to your pacifier, or your Dadda might get hooked on a tranquilizer. One thing is clear as far as I can see, it won't be easy growing up with a Dadda like me. But if life gets tough, girl I promise you this, I'll get you professional courtesy on a good therapist. One more thing you may want to remember, you'll have a brand new baby brother around mid-November. Try not to be sad when at first you see, we'll be putting him to sleep with your old paci. 

00:08:30
[sil.] 

00:08:30
CHRIS CORTMAN But I think Dr. Shinitzky can top that story. 

00:08:40
HAROLD SHINITZKY So you heard we were preparing. Doing the last minute changes on some slides, and this morning, I don't know but if you have a feeling of stress, having Protective Services involved would probably be probably that moment where you feel this is not good. I'm getting ready, in the bathroom showering, door closed. The next thing I know, there's this kind of change in the room and I turn around and fortunately I'd been in there for a while so the steam had built up but the door's open and there is just adorable little girl starring up. 

00:09:15
Dadda's Angel! 

00:09:15
Outline *Definitions of Stress -Characteristics Difference btw Stress and Depression *Normal vs. Problem *Successful Treatments -Experiential -Book Signing 

00:09:20
HAROLD SHINITZKY And that's the young lady that we just heard about the paci. Today's presentation will cover a myriad of topics. We are going to hit upon a number of the stress characteristics. We're going to move forward in terms of being able to talk about the distinction between stress and depression and then we're going to want to make sure that we go through a number of experiential as well as specific therapeutic interventions that you'll all be a part of. And, if we can, we might be able to meet with you all afterwards and kind of go through some of the material in the book. 

00:09:50
Operational Definitions of Stress 

00:09:55
CHRIS CORTMAN We want to talk about some operational definitions of stress, that is how different people would define stress to them. We just told you what was stressful for us over the last 24 hours. But let's share with you some things that have happened over the past week clinically in terms of how people would define stress. As mentioned in the introduction, I represent all of psychiatry and psychology right now at Venice Regional Medical Center, so anything that happens that needs a psych consult, I get called. And this past week, I was called because a woman who's one, one month shy of her 96th birthday was admitted into the hospital because she escaped a fire in her home. And they called me and said she has symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. And, of course, I said post-traumatic stress, that could affect her for the rest of her life. But then I said, but don't worry, it's not retroactive. It won't ruin her childhood. 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN Awwh. 

00:11:10
CHRIS CORTMAN That was the first one that brought up stress in my week. 

00:11:15
HAROLD SHINITZKY Looking back over my week, here's the first one that stood out for me. And I'm going to ask everybody, since you do have the slides in front of you, don't look at them. We're going to share them all up here. Let the information wash over you. You'll be able to reference back to them. Earlier this week, I had a young man who was referred to me by one of the, ah, private military schools. And unfortunately, on his family farm in the mid-west, there was a squatter apparently on the back forty, and so while he was back home with his father and his brother, they were going to go out to see if this was, in fact, the case. For some reason, he just felt like he didn't want to go out with his dad and his brother. And, sure enough, they went out to the little barn that they had out there and sure enough, there was a gentleman in there. And the father and the brother asked him if we wouldn't mind just please leaving the premises. The gentleman said, excuse me, sure. Went back in the house, came out with a shotgun, shot the father and the brother, both dead. 

00:12:05
UNKNOWN Oh. 

00:12:05
UNKNOWN Awwh. 

00:12:05
HAROLD SHINITZKY Brother, child, son is now in a tremendous amount of stress, and we are having the opportunity to be able to try to figure out what survivor's guilt is and the amount of stress that he's carrying with him. You have to speak up. 

00:12:25
CHRIS CORTMAN Another woman this week came in and said, I went to my doctor because I'm experiencing a lot of anxiety at night. I can't sit still. I'm just pacing. And so he said, I want to send you to a psychiatrist, and the psychiatrist said you have generalized anxiety disorder and I want to prescribe an antidepressant for you. But the woman said I don't like how antidepressants feel and I really prefer not to. And so the person said, well, there's nothing I, or anyone else, can do for you. You can't be helped. So this woman came in to see me and she told me the same story and I said to her, do you have this kind of anxiety during the day? Oh no, I'm fine during the day. Well, how about afternoon? No, I'm fine. When do you have this? I only have it in the evening when I'm home. I said well, it's not generalized anxiety then. It's specific to when you're home in the evening. What do you suppose that could be about? And she stopped and she said, oh, I know what it's about? It's about loneliness. I get really lonely now that I don't have a husband anymore. It wasn't generalized anxiety, and it's very treatable. 

00:13:45
HAROLD SHINITZKY On Monday, a young lady came in and expressed to me that she wasn't able to sleep, was struggling eating, didn't have much of an appetite, really couldn't concentrate and was starting to feeling--feel rather depressed. So she came in with her mother and we ended up having a conversation. The curious thing is, this young lady is a helper. She works with her community-based faith organization, loves making a difference in other people's lives. And her step-sister just moved back into the house. Her step-sister, unfortunately, has been a very bright person who's an underachiever. And she has been doing her best to help her yet--her step-sister out in terms of making good decisions. Because she's a type of person who personalizes other people's behavior and internalizes it, she now is starting to feel the stress because of her sister's rejection of her thoughts and recommendations. And what we're now starting to do is develop a sense of ego boundaries so she can understand that she doesn't have to personalize her step-sister's behavior. 

00:14:45
CHRIS CORTMAN One more story on stress this week. This time involving a 14-year old girl who told me that over the past week while being with her father, her, ah, parents are divorced, she smelled alcohol on his breath. Now she was told that if you ever see or smell your father drinking, you need to tell. But she remembered what her father told her that he hated rehab and he never wanted to go back there again. And then she also thought that if I tell somebody, maybe I won't see my father anymore. So for the past couple of weeks, she's kept the lid on a secret and we know that, like they say in the 12-step programs, you're only as sick as your secrets. She's been wearing a lot of anxiety and a lot of upset. And in talking to her yesterday, she finally decided, I can't keep this anymore, I need to tell my mother and whatever needs to happen needs to happen. 

00:15:50
HAROLD SHINITZKY By the way, this is one of the reasons why when we present, we oftentimes go along because we love sharing clinical stories. My last one for you all, on the start of this presentation was a young lady that I saw a while ago and we've been working together now--I saw her earlier this week. She has a certain level of stress when it comes to flying. So what we ended up doing was dealing with a lot of the material we're coming with--covering over today, from the ability of being able to expose herself to the stressor, to be able to relax herself. We use something that's referred to as successive approximations where we actually bring her closer and closer to the feared object. As it works out, we've been able to not only get her to the airport, on an airplane but, as a matter of fact, that this very normal-- she's now in Hawaii and I got a text from her earlier in the week and she's loving life. She can't believe that she's allowed herself to be a prisoner of her own stress for an entire life. 

00:16:40
Selye on Stress 

00:16:40
*General Adaption Syndrom -Alarm reaction -Resistance -Exhaustion 

00:16:45
CHRIS CORTMAN Nice job, but wait until you get my daughter years from now. So what exactly is stress then? Stress is a specific response to non-specific stimuli. What does that mean? Well, let's start out with a word that I rather you take home with you than any other word if you only had to remember one thing. The word is "threat." Stress always begins with the perception of threat. Without the perception of threat, there will not be the stress response. Now what's interesting is that what's threatening to one person is not only not threatening to another person, it's actually exhilarating sometimes to another person. In fact, ah, last year there was someone in the audience, ah, the wife of a good friend, she was, ah, his fianc�e at the time and for Valentine's Day, she decided to give him one of those gifts that keep on giv--giving and that was, uhm, a skydiving certificate. And I was thinking perhaps she really didn't want to get married when we gave him that gift. But he said to me, I'm going to go skydiving, would you like to join me? And, you know, as a guy, you can't say well, no. That would be kind of scary. So you say, yeah, oh yeah. I'll try anything once if it's legal. Sure, let's go. So, you know, we proceeded to go skydiving together, which means they take you in an airplane up 12,000 feet in the air before they shove you out, and they literally shove you out of this airplane. Now if you're first time at this, they, ah, it's, it's called a tandem jump. So they strap an instructor to your back, which wasn't a big deal because I've have had instructors on my back my entire life. So--but what I didn't know is that it was March and it's really, really cold at 12,000 feet. You know, and they videotape it and all you keep hearing me say is, hey guys, thanks a lot for telling me to wear gloves, it's freezing up here. It's freezing. And so, I'm up there and I'm really cold and this guy says, well you know what we are? We're the spotters. I said that's really cool. What does that mean? He said, well that means we have to lean out of the airplane and find the spot that we want to land on. So he straps himself to me and then we lean out of the airplane on one knee and the wind is whipping because we're going a 165 miles per hour and it's so cold. It was like someone taking my head and putting it in this--you know, like the waterboarding thing, this was that. Cuz when they would bring me back in, I would start telling secrets from my childhood. Anything you want to--stop doing it. Out the window, and he's behind me. He's not feeling any of this. So it's absolute torture up there. But, you know, there were a lot of people in that airplane who were afraid because they were going to be shoved out at 12,000 feet. But I noticed that there were some other people who did this every weekend. In fact, upon questioning, they said, this is what I do to relax. We come up here every weekend cuz this is our way to unwind. So there you go. Stress comes from the perception of threat. And if what's threatening to you, maybe climbing mountains or jumping out of airplanes or public speaking, might not be the least bit threatening to someone else. Now a researcher from the University of Montreal, Hans Selye, identified that stress actually comes in different stages. And he came up with this GAS, General Adaption Syndrome, of what stress is all about. And it begins with alarm reaction. That's the first stage of stress. What's the alarm reaction? Imagine you're driving down the road and in your rearview mirror you see flashing lights. What happens to you? Yeah, what's happening is you perceive what? Threat. 

00:21:20
HAROLD SHINITZKY Threat. 

00:21:20
CHRIS CORTMAN Right. It starts with the perception of threat. And so your blood starts pumping to--blood to the major muscle groups, your arms, your legs, your back, your shoulders. Your digestion shuts down, your sexual reproductive system shuts down. There's a secretion of certain hormones like cortisol and norepinephrine and your body is prepared to do what? 

00:21:45
UNKNOWN Fight. 

00:21:45
CHRIS CORTMAN Fight or flight. Fight or run away. And so now imagine as soon as you pull over, the car keeps going. He wasn't coming after you. What happens? The stress response goes away. And you could go through that literally everyday of your life and have no long-term consequences. We're built for short-term burst of, of adrenaline and the stress response. Stress is only a problem when we start sneaking into the second stage. And the second stage is a resistance stage. Most of the things that stress us out are not cops in the rearview mirror. Most of the things that are stressful are things like, I don't know if I'm going to be able to keep my job. They keep laying people off. I don't know if we're going to be able to pay our mortgage or if they're going to come and foreclose on our house. We keep fighting in this marriage and he's threatening to leave me with the children. Those are the kinds of things that are not only stressful but they remain stressful in stage two, the resistance, is the things that every day burden you, and you're actually literally aging your body by being stressed and by accumulating the stage one stress response by resisting and fighting it, which leads to third--to the third stage, which is a stage of exhaustion. And in exhaustion, you start to break down in certain ways. And according to some people, if you follow the GAS from step one, step two, step three, the fourth stage is actually disease. You've already broken down and now you have some kind of a disease. And you know what the fifth stage would be? 

00:23:35
UNKNOWN Death. 

00:23:35
CHRIS CORTMAN Death. So that would really be the five stages of the stress response. 

00:23:40

Orbital Frontal Cortex 

00:23:40
Hippocampus cell atrophy 

00:23:45
HAROLD SHINITZKY When you look at the research that's out there, a lot of the material that I'm going to be bringing up right now is from the National Institute of Mental Health, and what I'd like to kind of a just walk you through first is the process. Many of you, when we were talking at the break actually or wherever, several of you were looking forward to this. So let me just share with you. Obviously, we have a central nervous system. And, in particular, when we have that fight or flight reaction, it's due to the sympathetic nervous system lighting up at the acknowledgement of some perceived threat. So let's go back to that statement that Dr. Cortman just said, threat, perception of threat, that's an individual reality. Now, within the body, the adrenals are going to release two types of hormones in particular. What you end up seeing is a release, as you see there, is cortisol as well as adrenalin. That's going to light up the system and we're supposed to have it. It's supposed to be there for any type of a moment, immediate situational crisis. Short-term it's good. Long-term chronic is where it becomes a problem and that's where we heard about that from the GAS, from Selye's research. So if we move through it, in the brain, every time you perceive a threat, what we oftentimes see in MRI scans is the orbital frontal cortex lights up. Any type of trigger in the brain lights up in that area and then spreads out to two different types of neural pathways in the body, or in the brain I should say. One of those is, in fact, the hippocampus. Now for those of you who don't know, the hippocampus is the region of the brain that deals with memory. So if I was to ask you, what does the hippocampus focus on . . . 

00:25:20
UNKNOWN Memory. 

00:25:20
*Shorter & fewer dendritic branches 

00:25:20
Memory impairment 

00:25:20
Amygdala increase cells 

00:25:20
HAROLD SHINITZKY Excellent. See, yours is working. In this case, when we have excessive, long-term chronic exposure to cortisol, the hippocampus has numerous cells that are hypersensitive to cortisol. And over time, the chronic exposure of cortisol within the hippocampus actually causes cell atrophy. They actually die off. So what you end up seeing is a shortening of the ac--I mean, the dendrites, the actual part of the nerve cell that reaches out to other neurons to send messages. So you see shorter neurons in the brain of the hippocampus, in the area there, and you have fewer dendritic connections, so fewer connections. Actually, if you looked at it, the volume, the area of it, actually begins to atrophy, and that's where people end up having what's referred to as memory impairment. They can't concentrate or focus. The second neural pathway that gets lit up after the orbital frontal cortex lights up is the amygdala. And the amygdala is the area of the brain that deals with our emotions, the raw emotions. So if I asked you again, what is the hippocampus focusing on? 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN Memory. 

00:26:25
HAROLD SHINITZKY Memory. The amygdala? 

00:26:25
UNKNOWN Emotions. 

00:26:25
HAROLD SHINITZKY Emotions, that's right. So we're--by the way, your memory's working just great. 

00:26:30
CHRIS CORTMAN This is a smart crowd. They told us. 

00:26:30
Amygdala - Neuropsin -Synaptic cleft increase anxiety 

00:26:30
HAROLD SHINITZKY The odd thing is in the amygdala, you end up having an increased production of neuronal connections when there's excessive amounts of stress from cortisol buildup. So you end up having an area of one part of the brain, there's a decrease in volume and another area where you have more and that more is in an area where you end up having too much emotion going on. So the bottom one there is some new research that's come out, is that in the amygdala, there's a hormone released that is neuropsin and whenever there is the production of neuropsin, you end up actually seeing, as it says on there, within the little space between each neuron, the synaptic cleft which is about two thousandths in size, and I can't even make the space that small between my fingers. You end up seeing an increase in this chemical and when you have an increased production of that chemical, you have an increase in anxiety. 

00:27:20
Stress & Medical Consequences

*Abdominal fat *"apple shape" 

00:27:20
*Migraines & TMJ 

00:27:20
Eczema & Hives 

00:27:20
Anxiety Disorders 

00:27:20
HAROLD SHINITZKY So let's take it a little further. There isn't a single part of our body that is not adversely affected by chronic, long-term exposure to stress. And what we have up here is a number of studies that have been identified to specifically identify the diseases that are worsened, heightened or caused to actually deteriorate due to excessive stress. And as you see up there, Crohn's, multiple sclerosis and a multitude of other conditions in particular, going all the way to the anxiety disorders that we all oftentimes talk about, as we heard earlier, uhm, from general anxiety disorder, specific phobias, all of which builds up. 

00:28:00

*Investment + Threat = Anxiety/Stress 

00:28:00
*Female Cursed Life 

00:28:00
*Death of a Granddaughter 

00:28:00
*Olympic Diver 

00:28:05
CHRIS CORTMAN We want to talk about perception as being absolutely crucial when it comes to stress and stress management. Remember, it always begins with the perception of threat. In fact, investment plus threat is what produces anxiety. It's what produces the response of stress, meaning investment means you have to care about something. Those of you who are not sports fans can always be impressed by the degree of upset in your sports fan relatives that they will get tremendously excited by their team winning or deeply frustrated and angry when their team loses. You will never feel that way because of one reason only, there's no investment. In order to be stressed, you have to care, you have to be invested. Same thing when the stock market took a dive or the real estate market took a dive, you had to actually have real estate to be upset about that. Investment plus threat, I want you to remember that because it's so subjective as to what exactly is stressful. Let me give you an example or two about how crucial perception is when it comes to stress. I'm working with a woman now and she and her husband had the very unfortunate experience of having their two-year old granddaughter drown in their swimming pool. And you can imagine just how incredibly devastating that is, but the grandmother, my patient, wants very much to leave this house. She has blinds like that and the binds are closed around the swimming pool. She can't look at the swimming pool. And as far as she's concerned, we need to get out of this house. Conversely, her husband says we really need to stay in this house because our granddaughter is here, and we can never leave here because we would be abandoning our granddaughter. Now take a look at the exact same circumstance that they both survived and how dramatically different their responses are all because of the way they're perceiving the situation. Does everyone understand that point on perception? There's another woman I'm working with who is a professional woman in her thirties, two beautiful children. She's, ah, she's not only intelligent and lovely, she's kind, she's involved. But if you talk to her, she tells you she has a cursed life. A cursed life. And she says that because her anxiety's been elevated because one time she was abducted from a park at gunpoint and raped by a man. And because of the trauma that she went through, she decided the entire world is unsafe and she could never let that go because if she lets it go, then she loses her protection. So she remains anxious and, and tends consciously to think that the world is dangerous and my life is cursed because letting all of that go would mean I'm vulnerable again and something bad could happen to me. So understand that one of the many jobs I have to do in, in this relationship is to help her to release what has happened and to take a normal caution, not a hypervigilance but a normal caution because the hypervigilance keeps her stress response on the entire time and leads her to this terrible conclusion that my life is cursed when any outsider could look at her life and say, that's a pretty good life. I wouldn't mind trading places with someone who's young and educated and, and beautiful and has terrific kids like she does.

00:31:55
HAROLD SHINITZKY About half of my practice is, ah, sports psychology so I work with a lot of professional athletes and collegiate athletes and Olympians. And I happen to be working with a young lady who's going to be an Olympic diver. The curious thing is she's able to master all the moves and all the dives. And there's a point where it comes into competition for her where she has this belief that she's going to hit her head on one of the back dives. And when you watch it on film, you can actually see the trajectory takes her well away from the board. There's no basis of reality whatsoever. But underlying all this, the level of stress, she has a fear of judgment, of people judging her, that she's going to fail. So she has developed this way of defending herself. If I try and I fail, I'm the failure. If I don't try and I fail, well I'm not a failure, I just didn't try. So we're helping her to be able to see that her irrational belief system, to protect herself from her fear, is actually sabotaging herself. And she's now beginning to want herself with a much more realistic perspective. This past year, Dr. Cortman and I decided that we were going to put together all of the hours, it's now up to 85,000 clinical hours between the two of us. And so instead of waiting for people to develop problems, we'd rather deal with them as issues. So we put together Your Mind, An Owner's Manual For a Better Life. And the book is actually the top 10 issues or truths that people oftentimes misperceive as myths. And the nice thing about this is that the feedback on the material in the book is one of the most user-friendly, easy aspects. So you're going to get a lot of information that we've discovered over the years that's really applicable to this very topic and in particular, some of the feedback we received was, ah, specifically, thumbs up as well as, ah, yes you over there, it's, it's better to listen, better than listening to 16 minutes of tape. 

00:33:50
Myth vs. Truth #1 STRESS 

00:33:50
*Myth -Emotions come from circumstances or other people. 

00:33:50
*Truth -Emotions are not mysterious visitors; they can be identified and understood 

00:33:55
CHRIS CORTMAN I always try to figure out how Nixon had time to read the book so many years before it was published. The first, ah, chapter in the book deals with where emotions come from. And there's a myth out there that says emotions come from circumstances and they come from other people. And so again related to stress, we want people to always to understand that you create your own emotional response to everything by the way that you perceive it. Emotions are not mysterious visitors. Neither is the stress response. They can be id--identified and they can be understood and you can understand why your body is stressed. You can always say it's because of my children, it's because of my husband, it's because of my work environment but always understand it's not anywh--not any of those things. It's the way I'm perceiving any given situation. Oh, let me, yeah. 

00:35:05
HAROLD SHINITZKY Okay. 

00:35:05
Stress vs. Depression 

00:35:05
CHRIS CORTMAN On the next slide, we have the difference between stress and depression. Recognize that stress and depression are not the same thing. A lot of you probably know that this, but depression, clinical depression by definition has to last at least two weeks. You can't have a rough day or a bad weekend and be diagnosed with depression. It has to last at least two weeks. And what makes up depression? The most prominent and important symptom, of course, is dysphoria, low mood, down in the dumps, blues, sad, whatever you want to call it. That's a real important part of depression. The second most important symptom in depression, in fact, if you want to evaluate for depression according to, ah, the Harvard Mental Health letter, there's really two important questions to ask and one is have you been in a very low mood a lot lately. And the second one is have you lost pleasure in usually rewarding activities. And that's the symptom called anhedonia. When you no longer can feel joy or you no longer look forward to having your children come over or, or to play golf or whatever your thing is. If you don't look forward to it anymore, that's one of the major symptoms of depression. What else? There's a change in eating habits. There's a change in sleeping habits. Most of the time, you're not eating and you're not sleeping but it could go the other way too where you're oversleeping, hypersomnia, and you're overeating to self-medicate. Also, with depression, there's apathy, there's confusion, there's pessimism, there's, uhm, a lot of self-blame and disgust. There's often suicidal thinking. Uhm, all of those things. Sometimes there's, there's pain that goes with it too. And then there's this symptom called psychomotor retardation or agitation, and it really me--means in retardation that you're moving more slowly, that you have a real hard time just getting up out of bed and get going. These are the symptoms of depression, and again, they have to last at least two weeks. Now what is the relationship between stress and depression? Well, as you might imagine, if you're chronically under-stressed, it certainly can contribute to a major depression, especially with the element of hopelessness. In my mind, and again, this comes from the 55,000 hours of psychotherapy, there is no more important entry to clinical depression than the perception of hopelessness. 

00:37:45
HAROLD SHINITZKY As Dr. Cortman's talking about, there's this idea that you have to have a threat to have stress, the perception, before I move on to our next slide, let me just ask you, we're going to do in here a little competition. So we're going to bring this to life for everybody in here, talk about stress. You all familiar with American Idol TV show? A competition? All right. We're going to have a little competition up here. We're going to have you guys sing the national anthem and I'll pull a couple of you up here, and we're going to have everybody else vote. All right. So let's just say this young lady who happens to be seated up front right here . . . 

00:38:20
CHRIS CORTMAN The perception of threat is just . . . 

00:38:20
HAROLD SHINITZKY Stress. She's starting to sweat right now and sulking into the chair. Uhm, if I could ask you all, let's just say she just cut an album. She's the soloist at her faith-based organization. She just sang the national anthem up at the Tropicana. How would she be feeling about this opportunity? Bring it on! Time to shine! Now if I can't hold a flag and I don't know the words, what's my feeling about this? I hope the electricity, the power goes out on this. The reality is that the situation itself is neutral, it's neither positive nor negative. It's the perception of that and that's why we always want to bring it back to that statement. Your perception is your reality.

00:39:00
CHRIS CORTMAN Of course, some of us who can't sing a sing anyway . . . We, uhm, we were able to find a national study from the American Psychological Association called Stress in America. This is a study that they've conducted over the last several years. And this--these are the results from the year 2010. Can everybody see that and read that? Except for the people way--you guys are like in Venice. Anyway . . . 

00:39:40
HAROLD SHINITZKY It's in your handouts. 

00:39:40
CHRIS CORTMAN Yeah, it's in the handouts and you can see how people responded. And the question was what kinds of symptoms do you have when you're stressed. Now notice 45% of Americans endorse I become irritable and angry. Now I'm working now with, with a woman who, ah, recently lost her son, ah, after a long battle with cancer. He died at age 25. And right now she's, she's a very angry woman trying to, to just grapple with what happened and, and find meaning in that. And she was saying that there's an opportunity for her in town. I don't know if any of you know this but, ah, Habitat for Humanity, they build homes for people. There's, there's a home being constructed in Venice by women, just by women. And she wants to volunteer and, and the reason she wants to volunteer is because she said it will feel so good to pound those nails in. But I was listening to her and I couldn't get past the first part of it, that this is a woman, this is a house designed just by women. And I was thinking, this house probably has 17 bathrooms in it. And none of the toilet seats go up and down. They're always in the down position. You'll know if you buy that house. 

00:41:15
HAROLD SHINITZKY If you notice, 36% of people who actually filled out the survey said that they had anhedonia, the lack of pleasure from doing things. So I'm not sure if this is just saying they're not interested in filling out the survey anymore or if they have anhedonia in life. Little bit further down, we actually can see that 26% of the respondents said they had GI, gastrointestinal issues. I, I think that the number would have been higher but I guess they were in the bathroom. 

00:41:45
CHRIS CORTMAN Fifteen percent of the people endorsed bruxism, or grinding your teeth. How many people are bruxists? Wow! Yeah, I, I'm a bruxist too. And I would, I would tell that to some people and they say, wow, you're a bruxist? Is, is that an eastern thing? And I say, no mainly north and south. Also, if you notice that erectile dysfunction is 3%. Now that seems reasonable that when men are stressed they suffer from ED. But what was interesting is that back in the very same survey in 2008, 10% of the men reported that. So that number has seen some shrinkage. 

00:42:45
[sil.] 

00:42:50
CHRIS CORTMAN And speaking of that, my mother is not here so I can tell this. There was a woman talking about a cure for sunburn in men. And she said, the big key is you want to take Viagra for the sunburn. I said really, how's that? She said, well it really doesn't do a lot for the sunburned legs but it keeps the sheets from rubbing against them. 

00:43:25

*Effects of stress on children 

00:43:30
HAROLD SHINITZKY Yeah, her mom--his mom is not here. So, so two guys, ah, go hunting and one of them unfortunately has a cardiac condition, clutches his chest, knee to the ground, hand to the sky face to the dirt, he stops breathing. His eyes roll in his head, his body is just stressed, freaking out, grabs his cell phone, calls the emergency operator 911, says I'm by my friend, he's, he's dead. I can't--I don't know what to do. And the operator says all right, now calm down, in a very soothing voice says, you got to make sure he's dead first. So he walks over, puts the phone down, all of a sudden the operator hears, bam! He comes back over to the phone, he goes okay now what? In that same survey, Stress in America, there has been this increase across the board from self-report, as we can see here, 44% of the respondents in this case indicated that we have an increase in the stress reduction across our country since 2007. 

00:44:30
CHRIS CORTMAN Notice in this survey that so many people said that their personal healthcare is not a priority. Only 40% of the people said that their health was excellent. And 27% of the people said that they were happy with their exercise. How many people are happy with their exercise? Not too many hands. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN Few. 

00:45:00
CHRIS CORTMAN I would imagine that those people who are not happy are exercising way too much and they're unhappy about that. Is that--yeah. You know what they're saying now? There's, there's a, a report that said, you know, the 25 to 30 minutes three times a week, you can really up that to an hour a day. It's not too much to get an hour a day of exercise. 

00:45:25
HAROLD SHINITZKY I'm curious. On the survey, one of the aspects that they were asking people how come they're not doing what they're doing, or what they want to do, was indicated as a fourth choice on there that said willpower. So we had a significant number of individuals who said the biggest issue for them in terms of a barrier to their health is their own willpower. Now just, as say in, ah, research, there are three lies, lies, damn lies and statistics. And in this case, I'm not exactly sure what willpower means and it was a fourth choice. It was something they could check off. So in this case, I'd like to just emphasize, we do everything, every single thing we do, we do for a reason and it provides short-term rewards. So understanding why people aren't doing what might be good for them, you have to understand what they're getting from their current behavior, which is the short-term rewards. And also, when you look at just the whole change process, change is not an easy thing. That's why we have New Year's resolutions, cuz you haven't done it already. 

00:46:30
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:46:30
HAROLD SHINITZKY So we have to look at the only reason why you change is because the cost of not changing is more than the cost of changing. So in this case, I put up on the slide, the pre-contemplative phase. For those people who are unaware of that, that's from the Stages of Change Model of Prochaska and DiClemente. And if you get to know this one series of stages of change, everyone moves through a five-step process in order to change from unhealthy to healthy or actually in the reverse direction too. The pre-contemplative phase is when individuals are not thinking about it, against it, resistant or ignorant to it. So a lot of the people who have responded to this who said it was willpower, may, in fact, be in what's referred to as the pre-contemplative phase of the Stages of Change from Prochaska and DiClemente 

00:47:20
CHRIS CORTMAN I had a grad--graduate school professor who said people don't change unless it's too painful not to. That's not true 100% of the time but it's pretty good. When you think about what really promotes change, lots of times it's pain. It's some kind of hurt. It's some kind of fear. It's something uncomfortable. Something that, ah, psychologists would call ego-dystonic, meaning uncomfortable to the self, that promotes change in a lot of people. Let's look at that last item, effects of stress on children. There was a myth out there for a long time that said that children don't suffer from stress and they don't suffer from depression. We now know that children have depression in the same rates that adults do. And we know that children have symptoms that are different from adults because the bottom line is they haven't been here long enough yet to allow the stressors to accumulate to a point where they have the same illnesses that adults have. But you know what the number--the top three complaints, stress-related complaints are in children? You could probably guess. The first one is tummy aches. The first place that stress has its impact on children is GI complaints. The second one, headaches. They--if they tell you in the morning that they're having stomachaches or headaches, they might be some truth to that because that's where they often wear their stress. And the third one is really with insomnia. They'll have sleep issues. And lots of times that's because they're worried. They're frightened. What we also need to take a look at is that children are greatly impacted by the stress of their parents. In fact, there was a research study that came from this very same, ah, APA report that said that when parents are wearing a lot of stress, like if there's a domestic conflict, they, they will often underestimate the impact on the children. And so parents said, it affects the children 14%, 14% of the parents said that the stress that they, ah, experienced was bleeding down onto the children. And you know what the children said? Sixty-nine percent. Think of the huge discrepancy between what parents report and how the children are impacted. Now treating children, as we both do, we'll hear some of those things that parents aren't aware of. You know, I think of a boy now who's, ah, at Pineview and his parents are going through a divorce and his grades have taken a nosedive and now he's drinking. He's 15 years old and he's drinking with no, no history of anything like that in the family but now he's, he's dealing with his parent's conflict by saying school's not as important as I thought it was and now it's time to party.

00:50:30
*Family Health 

00:50:30
*Personal Safety 

00:50:35
HAROLD SHINITZKY Continuing on the same study that came out for Stress in America, there are 10 factors that they identified. We're going to hit upon a couple of them as highlighted points. The first one upon there, money, I want to just share something with you on that. Ah, as a psychologist working with individuals across the economic spectrum, money by itself is not a factor for stress. It's your perception of it. There are a lot of divorced wealthy people I work with whose lives stink, who are in tremendous conflict. Who have substance issues, and they are physically involved with domestic violence, who've engage in a lot of inappropriate behaviors. And there are a lot of very happy people who are in the lower socioeconomic. It's your perception of money. It's how you use it. It's what you do with it, hoard it, control it, use it for guilt and leverage. Ah, frivolous spending, one has to keep it. It's the factors within the relationship more so than just the issue of money. 

00:51:35
CHRIS CORTMAN Just to continue on the topic of money, are you all aware with--of the research on money and happiness? We have pretty clear information now on the relationship between having money and being happy. And it goes like this. The poor people are the least happy group in the country. The people who have enough money are happier than the poor. The people who are very wealthy are only about as happy as those who have enough. And they're both happier than the poor. And the comparison made by some who have studied the research is that money is comparable to health. When you have poor health, it's very difficult to be happy. If you have good health, you don't get a lot happier by having really, really good health. So the figure now from the last I heard is about $70,000 a year. When families have about $70,000 a year in income, they don't get a lot happier by having more. One study that was really eye-opening was that men who made $10 million a year were no more happier than their employees. And at, at the time the figure was closer to $40,000 of what the employees made. But the point being, there is some truth to the idea that money brings happiness but only to a certain level and beyond that, it's not going to bring you anymore. Let's go on to, ah, relationships being a major source of stress. One out of two people come into psychotherapy because of relationship issues. Fifty percent of the people that walk in our door are there for some kind of relationship issues. Relationship issues are huge contributors to stress and mainly because people have very poor ideas on what they can control and what they can't control. And we're going to talk a little bit about that in the final section when we talk about stress busters. 

00:53:45
HAROLD SHINITZKY One of the gentlemen I work with has a family history, and I actually met him when he was a teenager, has a family history of skin cancer and each one his older siblings and his parent had skin cancer. So the question that he came in with me was he was displaying all these fears and apprehensions of whatever I get on my body, it must be cancer. So he became hypochondriacal. But the reality was not if he was going to get skin cancer, but in his family, when. So he was constantly under stress by virtue of the family genetics and his own personal health. As it works out, he ended up developing a skin cancer. It was treated. It was resolved. It was placed behind him and he's been able to move forward from there. 

00:54:25
CHRIS CORTMAN One of the other items to look at there for me is the role ambiguity. Is that on the same slide? 

00:54:35
HAROLD SHINITZKY No, no. 

00:54:35
CHRIS CORTMAN That's the next slide? 

00:54:35
HAROLD SHINITZKY First is job stability. 

00:54:35
CHRIS CORTMAN Okay. Yeah, we have on this slide job stability. A major source of stress for so many people is the nagging perception that their job is not stable. In fact, one of the things that, that has most to do with a man's self-esteem according to research is career. And so we both have seen men who have lost their jobs and then have tumbled into a depression, a very difficult to treat depression even to the point of suicidal attempts. Why? Because losing their job meant losing their sense of self-worth, it meant losing their masculinity, their sense of potency in their family. A man oftentimes equates his worth with his productivity, with his capacity to provide for his family. We, ah, the generation before ours, the most important, ah, role that a man had, and sometimes the only role he had as a father, was to be a good provider. Not to be a nurturer but to be a provider. And when a man can't provide, sometimes you'll see him come apart at the seams. So let's, let's move to other situations that cause stress. 

00:56:00
HAROLD SHINITZKY Welcome back. 

00:56:00
Other Situations that Cause Stress 

00:56:00
*Caregivers 

00:56:05
CHRIS CORTMAN I want to skip to, ah, caregivers. There are 44 million Americans who are unpaid caregivers in this country. It's--the number is higher than ever before. And these are people who take care of someone in their own homes normally. Most of the caregivers are woman. How much of a surprise is that? 

00:56:35
UNKNOWN None. 

00:56:35
*Change (Good or Bad) 

00:56:35
CHRIS CORTMAN None. And the resear--do you know what the research is on caregivers? They end up getting very sick and sometimes sicker than the people that they're giving care to. And there's a huge emphasis today on getting caregivers into supportive help themselves. So if any of you are caring for someone at home, do not deny yourself your own needs because what you're involved in is a marathon and if you don't pace yourself, you know what happens when you try to sprint a marathon? You don't make it. So make sure that there's self-care going on whenever you go to care give to somebody else in your life. Change. Change is a major source of stress to all organisms but since we're here to talk about humans, how many of you are familiar with the research back in the 70s from Holmes and Rahe when they came up with the Social Readjustment Scale? And they had this, this, uhm, scale in magazines everywhere and you filled out how many of these items had happened to you in the last 12 months and you were assigned points for every one of these things that happened. Well, according to their research, anyone who totaled 300 points or more in the last year had a 90% chance of going into the hospital with some kind of an illness. Now remember, 100 points was the top of the scale for death of a spouse. They didn't have death of a child but I believe that's probably even higher if you could ever quantify it. And it would go all the way down, you know, change in, in environment, change in sleeping, all the way down to, uhm, 11 points for Christmas or minor violations of the law. You only got 11 points for a traffic ticket. But some of you got several of them in the same year, so you build up your points. Three hundred points in one years, you went into the hospital with a 90% chance. 

00:58:55
*Role Confusion -Unclear expectations -Am I Normal, Fit in, Am I liked 

00:58:55
HAROLD SHINITZKY I'm going to move through some of this really quickly just be virtue of the issue of time. When we look at the issue of role confusion as a factor for increased stress, I always like to emphasis if we think about it for any of us and when we think about our children that we're working with and particularly there are three questions that always have to ask themselves and it's something that permeates through our lives, am I normal, do I fit in and am I liked. Role confusion would be in terms of I'm not sure what role I hold for this job with this person. In addition to that, there's also role ambiguity, and within role ambiguity, we take a look at a couple of issues between the approach and avoidance. The first one, Dr. Cortman, medical conflict on that. 

00:59:35
Role Ambiguity (Approach - Avoidance) -Medical conflict -Halloween Cat 

00:59:40
CHRIS CORTMAN I work with a number of the physicians in my private practice and they will tell me that they always have this conflict where the pressure is on to see as many patients as they can in a day because their expected level of income, ah, to be up with their partners is, is, is, ah, substantial. They need to see a certain no--number of people and at the same time, it's vital that they give the patients the care that they need. If there's anything that patients really resent, it's going in to see their physician and getting the bum's rush. You ask one question, maybe two, and it's like quickly they're walking to the door. You know, you feel unimportant, you feel disrespected, you feel confused and frustrated that you can't even focus on what did the doctor really say. So physicians, like so many other people at work, find that they're always feeling that, that tug of war inside, I'm expected to give the best that I can but I'm expected also to see as many people as I can. 

01:00:45
HAROLD SHINITZKY Okay, stay with us. We're going to be moving quickly. You don't have to read the stuff. Let it wash over you. There you go. Ah, in addition to that, how many of you are familiar with the Halloween cat. That image of a Halloween cat? Greatest example of, uhm, the--this kind of push-pull, the role ambiguity, the hin--back legs are attacking while the front legs are backing up in retreat, successive ambivalence. And that's what you oftentimes see with this issue of role ambiguity. I don't know who I'm supposed to do, what for and I'm not sure what the demands are on my life so I don't know if I'm running away or going towards. 

01:01:15
CHRIS CORTMAN That sounds like marriage. 

01:01:15
*Powerless/Lack of Control -Real or Imagined -Abusive relationships -Perception of hopeless and helpless -Depressed pt 

01:01:20
HAROLD SHINITZKY In addition, feeling lack of control, a sense of powerlessness. The main issue that we want to emphasize is whether it's real or imagined, it's irrelevant. If you're perceiving it, if you think it's happening, that's all that matters. It does not matter that it's not happening. You have to be able to work through that. 

01:01:50
[sil.] 

01:01:50
HAROLD SHINITZKY Frustration. 

01:01:50
CHRIS CORTMAN Yeah. Remembering that when people are depressed, lots of times it has everything to do with the perception that they've lost all control and all hope. Now I remember working with a guy who came back from Vietnam and I, I heard from him that he'd be on--that he had been on many different antidepressant medications. And I said, well how long have you been depressed? And he said I can tell you exactly when my depression started. He said, I was sitting in my living room watching the news and I saw the Fall of Saigon on the, on the television. And at that moment, I became depressed. I said what, what exactly happened to you? He said, well that was easy, I knew at that I was a complete failure and I've been depressed ever since. The perception that he had was that I went over there and I failed at my job. We lost the war and therefore I know that I'm a failure as a person and nothing I ever do is going to add up to anything. So from 1975 until we began work together, he'd been depressed because of that perception. What was remarkable about this gentlemen was that in explaining that it was his way of thinking, it was his perception of these things that caused his depression, he was able to see that the war had--outcome had nothing to do with him. He did his job. He served his country the best way he knew how. And within a very, very short period of time, he was fine except for one thing. He came into my office a week or two later and he said, now that I'm feeling a lot better, I just have one question, how do I deal with the fact that I lost all those years to depression? 

01:03:45
HAROLD SHINITZKY Last point. 

01:03:45
*Having a Jewish or Italian Mother 

01:03:45
CHRIS CORTMAN And one more situation that causes stress in our lives. 

01:03:55
[sil.] 

01:04:00
CHRIS CORTMAN Yeah. I'm the one with the Italian mother but I think underneath it all they're, they're made the same. I think if you scratch behind them to--and see where they're made, they're made in the very same guilt factory. My, ah, my favorite story, and my mother didn't even do this one. This was a Jewish mother of a therapist I knew. She was, ah, running her first marathon and she was something like, you know, 45 years old. And so 45-year old women running their first marathon don't usually get across the 26.2 miles in, ah, or 26--is it 26.1? 

01:04:40
HAROLD SHINITZKY Two. 

01:04:40
CHRIS CORTMAN Two, yeah. They usually don't get there in a few hours. She came in at five hours and 17 minutes or something. And she finally got across the finish line and there was her mother. And you know what her mother said. You gotta appreciate this. She said, how could you do this to me? I've been so worried about you. Because, mom, it's all about you and your worry. 

01:05:05
HAROLD SHINITZKY When I used to travel by just flying all over the place, my mom used to say to me all the time, now remember, when you land call me. Cuz that whole time I'll be worrying. And somehow her worrying gave her this illusional, magical control over the airplane that somehow caused it to stay afloat. And then--and during turbulence, it somehow gave the pilots greater skill. And I would call her upon landing and what would be the first thing that she would do? Ahh, thank you. She actually believed at some level that she helped keep me up in the air and safe.

01:06:00
CHRIS CORTMAN Our next slide is about women and stress. We have some new information that says, you know, it's possible that women don't respond in the same way with the fight or flight as men do. In fact, what we're learning is that when women are stressed, very often they nurture. They go into what we're now calling tend and befriend. How many of you would find that that's true about you? When stressed you end up doing that? Well, only two of you. So let's throw this slide right out. And as I said before, you women, you fight and you run. There's no nurturance whatsoever. 

01:06:35
HAROLD SHINITZKY Sounds like marriage. 

01:06:40
CHRIS CORTMAN Okay then, other irrelevant research. Did you know that women are twice as likely to become depressed as men? And this is true worldwide. Now, we have new research that says it's only true during the menstrual years. It's not true before menstruation and it's not true after menopause, which would probably allow some of you the conclusion that all the depression is due to males. And there was much rejoicing. We also understand now that when women are stressed because of their marriage, it increases their chances for coronary heart disease times three. One research study found that having a very stressful marriage was as bad for you as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day. Unfortunately, lots of times because of your bad marriage, you're doing both. But very, very bad on the heart. Another study took place in Japan. And when women were caretakers to one set of parents in their home, they had a three times greater chance of sustaining a heart attack, a myocardial infarction, than people who did not have parents in their same house. Now in Japan, the rule of thumb is, you live with parents but they're always his parents. So for women living with their in-laws was a very dangerous thing for their heart. I'm sure it's not that way in America. I'm sure it just, it builds you heart and gives you lots of strength and stamina.

*NPR 

01:08:40
HAROLD SHINITZKY A slide that we'll move through relatively quickly on here is a certain release within women called oxytocin. How many people are familiar with this hormone that goes on in the body? That's right. And for before when we were talking about tending and befriending, we oftentimes see that for women, there is this tendency that it occurs and leads towards sexual arousal, bonding, more of the marital-- the maternal behavior. Now the curious thing about this, there's some wonderful aspects about what we see when we ask individuals on questionnaires and as you can see there, there's an increase in trust in our fellow comrades which is really something I think the world should have more of--generosity, empathy. Now what we hope is to also be able to talk about some of the other research. And here's one from NPR just recently. 

01:09:30
CHRIS CORTMAN The National Public Radio reported that oxytocin is more likely to be secreted in men when they're having sexual intercourse but for women, when they're hanging out with their friends. So there you go, Sex in the City versus sex in the bedroom, that's where we're different. 

01:09:50
Normal vs. Problem

*Everyday life not Long-term chronic exposure 

01:09:50
*Frequency 

01:09:50
*Duration 

01:09:50
*Intensity 

01:09:55
HAROLD SHINITZKY Now let's just kind of emphasize that stress is a normal aspect that we're all supposed to be wired to deal with and we're talking about that there's a distinction between short-term stress and chronic long-term stress. There's healthy stress when you get excited, when you awaken and you're told you need to be able to do something, when you plan, when you prep, that's all something that our bodies are naturally supposed to do, ah, experience. It's called U-Stress. When you look at the Yerkes Dodson inverted curve, that's where we're actually increasing our arousal and our awareness and our performance. And so we always want to take a look at frequency, duration and intensity when it comes to one's symptoms. 

01:10:30
CHRIS CORTMAN Let's just go to the next slide. 

01:10:35
HAROLD SHINITZKY Okey dokey.

3 Ways to Change Emotions and Address Stress 

01:10:35
*Biochemical 

01:10:35
*Sensory motor 

01:10:35
*Change your thoughts 

01:10:35
CHRIS CORTMAN There are three ways to change your emotions and to address your stress. Amazingly enough, there's only three ways to change your feelings. The first way we all know is biochemically. You can take a pill, you can drink something, smoke something, snort something, inject something. All of those things work to change how you feel. That's why there will always be alcohol and drug problems throughout the world because alcohol and drugs and other chemicals really do work in the short term to change how we feel. The second way is through our sensory motor system. And that means, you can cry, scream, jump, laugh, express feelings, we--by the way, we have research that says when you express feelings, you change your brain chemistry. We now know that in psychotherapy, it changes people's brain chemistry just having the capacity to express their emotions, very healing thing. Uhm, but recognize that one of the best things you could do in the short term to change how you feel is to go do something physical, get on your bicycle, do 50 pushups, go for a job, swim in the backyard pool, do something physical because that will always change your emotions. And the third way is to change your thinking and that's the most permanent way to change how you feel. When you change how you think, you invariably change how you feel, especially when you decide that something that you've been terribly invested in, whether it's keeping up with the Joneses, whether it's getting someone else's approval, whether it's attaining something that you now decided it's just not that important, by changing the way you think, it dramatically changes how you feel. 

01:12:30
Two Intervention Directions 

01:12:30
*Increase coping skills 1. Fire-fighter and Life Guard 2. School fire drills 

01:12:35
HAROLD SHINITZKY Now there's two ways to look at the interventions that we're talking about. The first one is actually to be able to increase your coping skills. And so when you look at that, I always like to say to people, when would you like a firefighter to learn how to fight fires? In the middle of a roaring blaze with a family on the second floor or in a controlled chimney burn? Obviously, you want them to practice ahead of time. When do you want a lifeguard to learn how to save lives? When there's a riptide taking somebody out or a local pool with a float dummy? Again, you want to practice these skills that we're going to be going through and when you get good enough at using them, when you need to use them, you'll be able to use them as coping skills. 

01:13:10
*Change your perception 1. Nervous system does not respond to reality, it responds to your perception 2. Gun 

01:13:10
CHRIS CORTMAN When I was a boy, we were taught how to respond to that ear-piercing noise called a fire drill. And we would hear that sound and we would know exactly what to do. What we would do is we would quietly stand up and then we would walk to the side of the classroom, line up single file and follow the teacher down the back stairs outside. We always knew what to do. It was never scary. We responded appropriately. And having that training was, was so important because, as we've learned, children in America do not get killed in school fires. They don't because we're very adequately prepared and knowing how to respond prevents all those fatalities. Second point is changing your perception. We've talked a lot about that but remember that your nervous system never, ever responds to reality. It only responds to your perception. If you think that he's cheating on you, it doesn't matter that he isn't, you're a mess because your nervous system only responds to your beliefs. Likewise, he could be sleeping all over town and you don't about it, you're fine. It always your perception. 

01:14:35
Traditional Stress Reduction Technique Stress Reduction Kit Bang Head Here Directions: 1. Place kit on FIRM surface. 2. Follow directions in circle of kit. 3. Repeat step 2 as necessary, or until unconscious. 4. If unconscious, cease stress reduction activity. 

01:14:40
HAROLD SHINITZKY I've got the statement of a gun up there but that's going to be a little too obvious at the moment, so I'm going to use this. This. Let's just say this. You don't know what this is. It's not eliciting any type of an adverse reaction. If you know it's a controller, doesn't bother you. But if this actually shoots out a laser by pressing this one button and I point it and it would kill you, how might that cause you to react? Little apprehensive right now? So if I now pull it out and you start getting nervous, it's because of your perception of it. Now if I stand behind you and you don't know I'm there, even though it exists and I'm standing right there with a threat to you, as long as you're not perceiving it. What we want to be able to do is just be able to emphasize there's two parts of the equation when it comes to people who are under stress. Obviously, not a life-altering stress like this, but one is coping skills and the other is changing your perception. So here's a nice way of dealing with stress. This is a traditional reduction technique that oftentimes used in America. As the slide says, place this firmly on a hard surface, bang head here, repeat until unconscious. Then stop. 

01:16:00
10 Interventions that Work (Approach>Avoid) 

01:16:00
*1. Cognitive-Restructuring 

01:16:00
*2. Response Prevention & Deliberate Exposure 

01:16:00
*3. Medications 

01:16:00
*4. Diet (Decrease caffeine, nicotine, & alcohol) & Exercise 

01:16:00
*5. Massage & Meditation 

01:16:00
CHRIS CORTMAN That's also known as child rearing. We have 10 interventions that really do work. And we have about 20 minutes and all kinds of stress busters. So again, forgive us but we're going to try to go things--go through things very quickly. Uhm, why don't I skip down to, uhm, diet and exercise, number four and I'll give this back to you. 

01:16:30
HAROLD SHINITZKY Oh, okay. 

01:16:30
CHRIS CORTMAN Okay. We, ah, we know that diet is actually very important in terms of managing stress and that nutrition is quite important, having a well-balanced diet, we know and have known for probably 30 years now, has a lot to do with how well we make it through a given day. But we also are accumulating a tremendous amount of research on exercise. And exercise does phenomenal things in terms of things like longevity. People who exercise tend to live longer. We, ah, we know that people who exercise regularly catch less colds than, than other people. There's a recent research study that says that people who walk were able to increase the size of their hippocampus. And what does the hippocampus do? 

01:17:25
UNKNOWN Memory. 

01:17:30
CHRIS CORTMAN Memory. Now show of hands though. How many people thought the hippocampus was a college out in Africa? Couple of you are nodding, yes. In this research study, they said that people 55 or, or older tend to have shrinkage in the hippocampus of the brain that actually shrinks in normal people. But by walking, this was a University of Pittsburgh study, by walking, these people increased the size of their hippocampus by 2% just by doing walking a few times a week. The researchers were greatly encourage because they said you didn't have to join a gym, just put on a pair of shoes and start walking. Does phenomenal things for your brain. One more research study on exercise that you have to hear about before we move on, and that is a Duke University study that compared exercise to Zoloft and in the short--for depressed people--and in the short term, they were running neck and neck and beyond a few weeks, exercise blew away the antidepressant. In fact, the recidivism, meaning relapse, was 8% for people who were exercising and 38% for people who were on the antidepressant. Much better first option than getting on medication for exercise. 

01:19:00
Cognitive Restructuring 

01:19:00
*1. Catch negative self-talk -First sounds easy but it is difficulty 

01:19:00
*2. Insert positive, realistic, productive self-talk -Second sounds difficult but it is easy 

01:19:00
*Perfectionism 

01:19:00
*CanNOT 

01:19:00
*Catastrophize -Seligman (internalize fault, globalize to all, project) 

01:19:00
HAROLD SHINITZKY Since most of you are in the re--well if not all of you, are in the rehab field, you're probably experiencing the reality that your patients are struggling with a lot of stress. And so what we're providing you right now is a whole host of interventions that you'll be able to use with them, refer to, uhm, offer up if they want to seek out any additional service. In particular, the one topic that's up there right now, cognitive restructuring. I'm going to go through it really quickly in terms of the topics. Oftentimes talk about catch yourself when you have negative thinking, insert something positive. Most people would say, well that would be relatively easy and relatively difficult. First part seems easy, second part seems difficult. The reality is the first part is really difficult, the second part's really easy. Catch yourself when you have negative intrusive thoughts. The reason why it's hard is that this has become a pattern for that person. It's almost like a friend. They don't even notice it until they're shouting at themselves. So you have to help them be able to catch themselves earlier in the process. Insert something positive, they'll oftentimes say well that's kind of impossible. Actually, it's not. If you would ask any of your friends or family, you ever take a look at reality, it's what you've accomplished, what you have done. I'm a hard worker, I'm diligent, I'm really going to try again. I'm a smart person. I pick up things quickly. In the recovery, we always want to talk about this, perfectionism and we'll talk about this on our stress busters. Perfection I always use as a motivation to do better. There's always room for improvement but never a criteria to judge yourself by. That's setting yourself up to beat yourself up. Another one, when it comes to what they're focusing on, I see this with amputee victims, neuro-rehab patients, uhm, any type of cancer patient who has lost certain functioning, you cannot tell your brain what not to focus on. If I ask you not to think of a big purple elephant, especially one with pink polka dots, every time you tell yourself not to focus on it, that's all you're focusing on. So individuals who are focusing on I can't do this skill anymore will probably end up being depressed. If you focus on what you can do, you'll be much happier. 

01:21:05
CHRIS CORTMAN Just one more thing on the cognitive restructuring. A psychologist named Martin Seligman has done a lot of work to understand the importance of how we think and especially how we explain the world to ourselves is called your explanatory style. People have styles of how they interpret the world around them. And he found out that people who, who are depressed explain the world differently to themselves than people who are not depressed. And people who are depressed have a way of personalizing things that happen. There's a tremendous amount of self-blame. No matter what happens in their lives, they'll see themselves as being somehow responsible for it going so poorly. The second thing they tend to do is they globalize things. So if they did poorly on a test, instead of saying, wow, I, I really messed this one up, I should have studied a lot harder, they're more likely to say, see, see what a failure I am. See what a loser. And the third thing they do is they project onto the future that things will never change and they'll never get any better. And having those three ingredients in, in their perspective of the world, in their explanatory style is what has much more to say about why people become depressed than any kind of chemical imbalance that you hear so much about from the drug companies. So please understand that if my thinking can lead me into that way of, of feeling and responding, my thinking can also be my ticket back to, back to mental health. 

01:22:45
Response Prevention & Deliberate Exposure 

01:22:45
* Professor Gallagher and his controversial technique of simultaneously confronting the fear of heights, snakes and the dark. 

01:22:50
HAROLD SHINITZKY On our next slide here, we just talk about the emphasis it's much better for your patients to be approaching whatever the stressor is to resolve it than avoid it. In this case, we happen to have a cartoon up there where there's an individual inside of a booth that's dark and with snakes in it and he's held up by what seems to be a cord above some high elevation and at the bottom the caption says "Professor Gallagher and his controversial technique of simultaneously confronting the fear of heights, snakes and dark." That would be considered flooding in this case. But what we want to emphasize is the technique is actually response prevention, deliberate exposure. And so there are things that your patients are going to be avoiding. Avoidance gives them short-term relief without any long-term resolution. That's what a phobia is. What we want to be able to do is help them to be able to be exposed to whatever that stressor is and figure out coping skills that we're going through to resolve it. 

01:23:40
CHRIS CORTMAN Those two techniques that Dr. Shinitsky just mentioned, they are the cutting-edge treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Deliberate exposure and prevent--response prevention, what does that mean? That these people who have these rituals that they have to do that they are forced to, to not do them. Their response is prevented. They have to agree to have some people in their life to stand in the way and say it's not okay to do that ritual. You must force people, when they're ready, to, to whatever is they're afraid of. If you ever want to get past your anxiety, it will always be as a result of facing what you're most afraid of. I have a woman who, who just came to me recently and she has a fear of going up and down stairs. It's usually a fear of riding elevators but she doesn't mind elevators, she has a fear of walking up. So you know what we do during our sessions? We walk up and much to her amazement, she can walk up stairs and she can walk downstairs. And she'll never do it unless she's forced to face that which she's afraid of. It's the treatment for phobias. It's the treatment for panic attacks. It's the treatment for OCD. You must be able to face that thing that you're most frightened of if you ever want to conquer it. 

01:25:05
Medications S/T, Sx not cure, Not Primary, IMH combination, Add 

01:25:05
*Anxiolytics -Ativan, Klonopin, Xanax 

01:25:05
*Antidepressants -SSRI/SSNRI - Paxil, Prozac, Zoloft, Lexapro, Effexor -Tricyclies - Tofranil, Pamelor, Desipramine -MAO - Nardil, Marplan 

01:25:05
*Anti-convulsives 

01:25:05
*Beta Blockers -Propranolol, BuSpar 

01:25:05
HAROLD SHINITZKY Moving to the idea of medication. The, the curious thing is whenever we talk about any type of medication for individuals who are stressed out, it is purely a conversation of short-term intervention. It is in no way considered a long-term inter--intervention. So what they end up doing is their--the medication is set up specifically to be able to address the symptoms. It is not a cure. Uhm, as you can see from what's going up on the slide right now, there's a whole host of different medications that are prescribed for individuals who have some type of stress or anxiety condition. Again, this is only meant for someone to have it for a short-term intervention, certainly not long-term relief. And it's supposed to be addressing the symptoms. It is not a cure. There isn't a single person out there who's a quart low on Zoloft. You don't administer it and suddenly they're back up to speed. The reality is, it's treating the symptoms on that. Last but not least on there, there's a lot of research that's out there. Historically, what we've been discovering is that the National Council of Mental Health has been talking about how it's a combination. It's not just medication alone but a combination that leads to productive outcomes. And there's some even more recent research. 

01:26:15
2 Physiological Approaches 

01:26:15
* Diet and Exercise 

01:26:15
*Massage & Meditation Ludwig, DS et al. 2005 JAMA, Meditation and Mind 

01:26:15
CHRIS CORTMAN Some of the more recent research is saying it's actually better if you want to help someone who's agoraphobic to not have them on medication but to have them have the type of therapy called exposure, where they have to face what they're afraid of, that they're more likely to permanently resolve the issue than to have medication. Uhm, I won't comment any further on, on medication. Let's move on to meditation. In meditation, we now have some research that says that it changes your brain neurochemistry, which is really, really fascinating that just by being able to still your mind and to focus and to calm your body down that you can actually change your brain. There's some research about the effectiveness of what's called long-term yoga. I, I'm not sure exactly what that is. I believe you have to stay in a pretzel position for 12 years but, but it does seem to work in terms of, of bringing your overall anxiety level down. There's a lot of western people who want nothing to do with meditation because they think it's such an eastern concept. But if you check your Bibles, the word meditation is in there so very often. We now have someone who wants to come up and meditate with us. 

01:27:35
UNKNOWN I will. 

01:27:35
Anticipatory Guidance 

01:27:35
*What has worked? 

01:27:40
HAROLD SHINITZKY A lot of research out there is actually from Dr. Benson at Harvard University. He's known as the father of the mind-body, ah, experience in the field. And he has been really kind of pushing this idea through research, and it's taking a double-blind intervention to be able to give individuals a range of therapeutic interventions. In particular, let's take to the next one. It's called anticipatory guidance. And the nice thing, I've just put up on the slide here actually a list of what you want to be able to do to be able to talk with the patient that you are working with who has a tremendous amount of stress. And really what you want to look at is really? Wow, we just got the 10-minute notice there. And down here we've got 20 minutes back there. Oh. 

01:28:20
CHRIS CORTMAN Let's go with his. 

01:28:20
*What has not worked? 

01:28:20
*When you have struggled, identify triggers? 

01:28:20
*What options & alternatives exist? 

01:28:20
*What support network exist? 

01:28:20
*Practice & rehearse 

01:28:20
*Understand compulsive cycle (Change perception and increase coping) 

01:28:25
HAROLD SHINITZKY I like that guy back there. So asking your patient what's worked for them in the past, what has not worked for them in the past, to be able to help them to identify what the struggles are, be able to come up with what supports they have in their life and what alternatives they would use when that does take place. That would be like if your physician prescribed you medication and said, you might get dry mouth. Hmm, what should you do? Hmm, you might want to take some water with you. You burn easier. How about if you stay out of the sun, wear a big hat, put on more, more sunscreen. Anticipatory guidance allows you to handle something, planning on it as you move forward. And understanding what their compulsive styles are in terms of what they've done in the past and what they get out of doing it.

Stress Busters 

01:29:00
"STRESSED" is "DESSERTS" spelled backwards 

01:29:00
CHRIS CORTMAN Why don't we move right into the stress busters. We have a lot of stress busters and very little time. These are the things that we believe people need to understand if they're ever going to reduce the stress level in their lives. Most conferences you go to are going to tell you the same kinds of things to, you know, to exercise, to do relaxation, to have good relationships, to do those things. We want you guys to know that there are some ways that you can think to permanently change your stress level. The first one I want to mention has to do with the concept of carryover stress. You all heard of the term carryover stress? What carryover stress is, you're at work and you are stressed out because of what's going on in your marriage or with your children. You have literally carried over from home the stressors and you are displaying those feeling, ah, at work. Okay, here's a concept that really works for some people. How many of you are familiar with superheroes? How many of you actually are superheroes in disguise? Yes, I see you sir with the green hat, which--you're not Spider Man, are you? I'll bet you climb the walls sometimes though. Yes. Okay, the, ah, the, the research says that you can have the ability to leave behind what's going on at home in the parking lot by having a mindset that says, I am like a superhero. I need to change my outfit now and become nurse. Like a superhero, I am physical therapist now. I am physician. I'm psychologist. I'm occupational therapist. I have a uniform I must wear it. Notice that that's what Superman did, that's what Underdog, that all the great superheroes, they would all change their outfit and, and with the outfit came a change of behavior. Even priests put on a certain robe and their--it changes their mindset. Now I am a priest, now I'm here to serve the people for God. You must do two things in the parking lot. Number one is you must leave what's at home in the parking lot when you go to work and on the way out the door at the end of the workday, you're to leave your work in the parking lot in that same spot. Change your outfit, change your mindset. How many people are paid extra to go home and worry and be upset about their job? Just the one woman in the back. I'd love to see her contract. They're not paying you to just stress yourself. They're not paying you to bring that home. Learn everyday how to put that aside. You can do that. You can learn to do that.

HAROLD SHINITZKY You know, the curious thing is if you're taking it with you, you're not really focusing on what you need to and you're really not taking care of what you're focusing on, so you're doing a half-ass job of all of it versus scheduling, I need to really focus on it and do it one at a time. Let me, let me offer up another one for you. Each one of us has a tendency of kind of when we're under stress to kind of go a default mode, how we explain what we do. And a lot of people under stress use certain defense mechanisms. So think about this. I'm just going to toss out a bunch of different words and explain them really quickly. If your patient uses these, this is how they keep themselves in an unhealthy direction. They might rationalize their behavior. They're coming up with an excuse, an alibi. They may externalize their behavior, blaming it on somebody else. They may minimize their behavior. They acknowledge what it is, they just don't make it nearly as important. They intellectualize their behavior and say, well almost everybody I know is going this. Whenever they use these types of behaviors, these defense mechanisms to continue their behavior, it's important to kind of point this out. This is themselves sabotaging their own optimal health.

CHRIS CORTMAN You all are familiar with the serenity prayer? Where basically you take a piece of paper and you draw a line down it and say life has two components, things that I can control and things that I can't control. We can actually go a little bit further than that and that is, everything in your life that you can't change, fix or control, you must respond appropriately to. And so many people are not aware of the fact that they are responding very inappropriately to the behavior of other people. They're stressing themselves out about the lack of control that they have. And I point out to virtually everyone that I know you have this skill and I can tell you that you have this skill based on the way you're dressed. They say, want do you mean? I say because outside it's 85 degrees and you're dressed in short sleeves and shorts. I'm, I'm certain that you probably didn't go out there and do a rain dance today. You didn't pray to the sun god. You didn't try to do something to affect the weather, did you? And they'll say no, of course not. Well, that means you already have an understanding that you cannot change the weather so what you did is you accepted it and you responded appropriately to that which you can't change. I want to tell you there's a whole bunch of other things under that column of things that you won't be able to change or control ever. And you know what's under that column? The economy, the traffic, stock market and other people's behavior. You don't get to control other people. So your options begin with I can respond appropriately to them or I can stress myself out every day because my husband refuses to stop drinking, because my daughter is, ah, failing at school or because, you know, somebody in my life continues to have anger management issues. I can't control what the others do. I can only learn to respond appropriately to them. No matter who they are, you don't have a remote control for them. So if you learn how to respond in a healthy way, it'll significantly change your stress level. 

01:35:20
HAROLD SHINITZKY It's curious, we oftentimes talk about individuals who are under stress need to learn how to say no. The process of assertiveness. Think about it as an acronym, A-S-S-E-R-T. When someone violates the boundary and expectation, you'll need to be able to gain their attention, do it soon after it takes place, be specific about the behavior, talk about what the effect is it has on you, offer a new response that's acceptable by you and if the person follows through on that new response, there are new terms of this relationship, A-S-S-E-R-T. It's a, it's a common problem-solving method. Well, let's talk about another one. Dr. Satta talked about, in his research in 2002, the idea of--or 2001--the idea that having ample sleep. Most people who unfortunately in our society aren't getting enough sleep and we know that from all the research across the board. Individuals who have a lack of sleep tend to have more hyper-emotional reactions to situations and tend to go around with too much anxiety in their life. Follow that up with Dr. Lang's research, just go across the board, you have to be able to address caffeine, nicotine, sugars, alcohol and drugs, cigarettes, all of which if you actually ingest, people talk about using them for short-term gains but the long-term consequences are grave and so we need to be able to be vigilant about the effect they have on us as an individual. 

01:36:45
CHRIS CORTMAN So much of what causes us stress are unfinished things from our past. I would say to you if there is anything that still hurts you from your past, it will stress you every single day of your life until you finish it. You heard in the introduction that one of my specialties is dealing with trauma. Every day I work with somebody who has something unfinished from their past, whether there's a rape, whether there was child abuse, whether they were physically beat up or rejected or abandoned, and I'm here to tell you, all those things can be healed if you're brave enough to face them. And if they still hurt, if you can tear up by thinking about them, or if when it comes to mind, you quickly try to dismiss it because it's too painful, you are not finished with it and every day it's robbing you of emotional energy and everyday it's distressing you. And, and I, I want you to understand that, that there are things that happened from five and six and seven decades ago, remember the notion time heals all wounds, false. Time just passes. That's all time does. Healing is an active process and, and the most important thing you could take with you on how to heal something is you have to let it go. And it comes down to, I need to let go of every bad and painful thing that's happened to me by facing it, by, by talking about it, by expressing my pain, by releasing my pain, I can take something that's been haunting me for six and seven decades and put it away. I could tell you story after story after story about people who come in with things they didn't even know at the time or they didn't know it was still haunting them and by getting into it, they finally released a major source of distress in their lives by, by being brave enough to face it. 

01:38:45
HAROLD SHINITZKY I know we're running short on time so I'll be quick on this one. Mitigating your exposure to toxic people and situations. Being able to decrease your exposure to triggers in your life. Let me put it a different way. In therapy, we oftentimes talk about sometimes the best thing to do in a dysfunctional relationship is not to be in it. And unfortunately when we have our patients who are coming in, they might be experiencing enough of their own stress and strain due to their rehab and their recovery that we have to be able to consider, there are individuals in life, in their life who unfortunately may be imposing too much of a stress and we need to try to decrease that exposure. 

01:39:25
CHRIS CORTMAN I want to tell you one more thing. It's a story about Morris and Esther. Morris and Esther were a very elderly couple who didn't get out very much but they did like to go to the Florida State Fair once a year. And Morris one year saw these helicopter rides that just fascinated him. And he said, oh Esther, I would really like to go on a helicopter ride. And Esther looked over and she saw the sign and she said Morris, it costs $50 and $50 is $50. And Morris just sighed and they went home. But they came back the next year and Morris saw the helicopter and he had a big smile and he said, oh Esther, I'd really like to take a ride on that helicopter. And Esther said, Morris, you said that last year. It costs $50 and $50 is $50, you know. But they came back this year and Morris saw the helicopter and this time, he walked right over to the helicopter and Esther followed right behind him and he said, oh Esther, I really would like to ride on that helicopter just once. And she said, I know Morris, you tell me this every year but it costs $50 and $50 is $50. He said, I know dear but I'm 85 years old. And if I don't get to ride on this soon, I may never ride it. Well, the pilot overheard their conversation and he stepped over and he said, okay you two, tell you what I'm going to do. I will give you a ride on my helicopter for free but neither one of you better say a sound. If I hear one word from you, I'm charging you $50. So Morris looked at Esther and Esther looked at Morris and they agreed. And they climbed into the back seat of the helicopter. And this pilot took them on the most harrowing ride for 15 minutes. This guy took every twist and turn and nosedive that he knew how to do. And when he finally landed, he turned around and he said, that was amazing, that was the toughest ride I ever gave anyone and you didn't say a word. And Morris said, I know, I really wanted to say something when Esther fell out but $50 is $50.

HAROLD SHINITZKY For some individuals to gather some more information, there's a website that we've just kind of put up there on the line called www.ableville.com. It's actually going to be a web resource for patients and family members to be able to connect with providers. It just actually went up on, ah, live, it's in its beta phase, about a week ago. So any providers, they get their own no-charge web page. Want we want is every patient with any condition to get access to every single specialty that they need for comprehensive service. That's the plan. Uhm, obviously, the take-home messages for today: We create our stress by our perception of threat. Stress that we're talking about today is treatable. If untreated, we know, that this is a chronic condition that can lead to terrible health outcomes and premature death. And stress needs to be, as we were saying, faced head-on, approach, don't avoid it. And despite every possible effort that you are going to apply yourself right now, you will be seduced in terms of being able to follow up with us. Touch base on our book. I want to be able to thank you all for your time, your attention. Hopefully, you'll be able to use all the interventions that we chatted about today with your patients. Thank you again for all the time.
