BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
UNKNOWN So Jen(ph), you've just had session with Norma(ph). 

00:00:05
JEN Uh-huh. 

00:00:05
UNKNOWN And we said we just kind of talk a bit about how it was for you, how you experienced them. 

00:00:10
JEN Ah, I was quite surprised how, ah, emotional I became. First of all, I hadn't expected to, to get so tearful. So it felt very raw. 

00:00:25
UNKNOWN You brought up something that you thought would be safe and then it wasn't, yeah. 

00:00:30
JEN And then whoa, it wasn't. 

00:00:35
UNKNOWN And Norma(ph), how did she seem like she was in your frame of reference? 

00:00:40
JEN Well, very much so and I think that's possibly why it, it felt the way it felt, uhm, because I did feel that she really knew what I was trying to say. 

00:00:55
UNKNOWN So she heard what you were saying? 

00:00:55
JEN Yeah. 

00:00:55
UNKNOWN And understood. 

00:00:55
JEN Yeah. 

00:01:00
UNKNOWN And I guess the thing that she would always be worried about or thinking about is whether she was guiding or directing, or nudging you in any way? 

00:01:10
JEN I didn't get that impression at all. I mean, there were-- I didn't get that impression at all. 

00:01:15
UNKNOWN That she was simply where you are. 

00:01:20
JEN Yeah, yeah, I mean, there was you know, couple of times where you know, we sat in silence and it felt like quite, ah, I mean, for me what it gave me is a chance to sort of take stuck of what was going for me but Norma(ph) didn't-- you know, she left that for me to then, then they share it something, and say something more. There was no sense at all that she was, you know, hurrying me along or asking me questions even. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN I was conscious in those silences in thinking how that look say just what Jen(ph) needs. 

00:01:55
JEN Yeah. 

00:01:55
UNKNOWN And you having that space - 

00:02:00
JEN Yeah. 

00:02:00
UNKNOWN - to reflect, to think things over. Ah, and the temptation for a kind of notice(ph) council and might be to kinda jump in and move things along because nothing is being said, so nothing is happening with (inaudible ) either. 

00:02:20
JEN I don't think nothing was happening. I think that's actually where a lot of, of what's happening where I was, ah, at one particular point where I was sort of aware that there were two conflicting sort of, ah, views and beliefs, ah, and having that silence gave me the chance sort of notice that actually that you know, have got you know, these sort of dichotomous sort of values. Uhm, so it was really helpful, really helpful. 

00:02:50
UNKNOWN So there were two of you in the room, that was what Norma(ph) was providing. 

00:02:55
JEN Uh-hmm. 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN I mean, Norma(ph) as a person. 

00:02:55
JEN Uh-hmm. 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN And I wonder how you experience that? 

00:03:00
JEN Ah, I think the more I talk, the more I became aware of, sounds really weird, how much she love me. How it was, how it was okay what I'm saying, you know, how she was-- I mean, she didn't really say it but to-- but to-- but I got that sense that, ah, I got the feeling that, ah, she was really conveying that I mattered. 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN Did she absolutely accepted you as you? 

00:03:40
JEN Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN All right. Were there any times when you felt that she wasn't there? That she missed it in some way? 

00:03:50
JEN Uhm, no-- not really. I mean, a couple of, a couple of the, the meanings of things but the way you know, uhm, it wasn't quite right but then you know, when I say, ah, that way, then I got the sense, ah, yeah, then she understood then what I meant. 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Like it was a moment quite early on when you say you've received a card but not a present. 

00:04:20
JEN Yeah. 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN And she put it back as if you did not received a card. 

00:04:20
JEN Yeah. 

00:04:20
UNKNOWN But there's something about then, or that clarify that. 

00:04:25
JEN Yeah. 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN You know, the, the-- you were able to be clear about it then know that you are. 

00:04:30
JEN Yeah, I mean, there was no sense that she-- there was no way through it all that I have the feeling that she doesn't really know what I'm trying here. It was quite, quite the opposite. I had the distinct feeling that actually she really knows what I'm trying to say here. 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN Is there anything else in that session? 

00:04:50
JEN Well, other than the sense that, that sense that she really knows it could have been, it could have been a silence and that I still had the sense - 

00:05:00
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:05:00
JEN - that she knows what I'm feeling. 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN So how she was - 

00:05:05
JEN Yeah. 

00:05:05
UNKNOWN - gave you a space in which you felt understood, loved, heard. 

00:05:10
JEN Yeah. 

00:05:10
UNKNOWN And then you could work in that space. 

00:05:15
JEN Yeah. 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN Okay, thank you. 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN Okay, Norma(ph) you've had a session with Jen(ph). 

00:05:25
NORMA Yup. 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN And I wonder how that felt for you? 

00:05:30
NORMA I think, right and talked a bit. It's, uhm, it, it's quite hard to remember, to be specific about it and I'll need to go back and reflect, you know, and, ah, yeah, to share it through and think about it, ah, in a more reflective place. But what I was-- what I was trying to do is just really sure what Jen(ph) was saying whatev-- in whatever way she was going to say it, you know. Uhm, I mean, m-- notice, not just say the words but notice her as well and how she was saying it and maybe how, yeah, how she present it as well. I, I just didn't want to-- when we did focus a lot of the feelings because that's what she want but if she just talked about thoughts or you know, how to be just being-- had it not been so emotional, I would have tried to have listen to whatever she was saying in that session. 

00:06:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:06:40
NORMA But also, to be aware of what was going on for me doing that session and how my responses might have impacted you know, what was happening in the relationship and, and doing(ph) for weighing of my responses and her you know, thoughts and feelings. 

00:07:05
UNKNOWN So in the space that was there, you were following her, she was talking a lot about feelings. 

00:07:15
NORMA Yeah. 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN So that's where you work with her. 

00:07:15
NORMA Yeah, yeah. 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN But it might have been quite different. 

00:07:15
NORMA Could have been, yeah. 

00:07:20
UNKNOWN Ah, and, and what you're saying is you wouldn't have been pulling her back to talk about feelings. 

00:07:25
NORMA Yeah, it did-- it felt, it felt important, it does feel important to me to sort of walk alongside and not push her over (inaudible ) that is you know, that, that's a bit I'm going to reflect on if, uhm, you know, if I was just in the general, just pulling you know, this thing ahead and say come on, Jen(ph) (inaudible ), don't hear. But I think in the main, uhm, I stayed with the pace that she was working at you know, through process. And I know there were lots of silences, uhm, and that didn't feel appropriate to break those - 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:08:10
NORMA - you know, to give her that. Uhm, for however long it needed for it to come back to me you know, and I love this every time she went into the, the silence. She sort of look that way and it almost you know, imagine to think and then feeling you know, and it didn't feel right to sort of interfere with that. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN So there were things outside the rhythm(ph) that she was reflecting on. 

00:08:45
NORMA Yeah, on what was going on for her. 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN Right, right. 

00:08:50
NORMA And, and there were times, I think when I knew that her life and my life had crossed that it-- there was a familiar experience there for me. Uhm, but then when I clocked, I thought it right, okay, and know I'm there, I need to hear Jen's(ph) experience of this. 

00:09:20
UNKNOWN And not matter(ph) that with yours. 

00:09:20
NORMA I'm not-- I'm not gonna live up with mine, you know. 

00:09:25
UNKNOWN And you were talking about being aware of yourself in that session. 

00:09:30
NORMA Yeah, yeah. 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN I guess that's part of that process. 

00:09:30
NORMA Yeah, yeah. 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN What's mine, what's Jens(ph). 

00:09:30
NORMA Yes, yeah, and aware also and it came to, ah, I'll be more clear about this one, I go back and look at it but, yeah, that, that, that part, I think it was towards the end when, when a sort of self-disclosed if you like. Uhm, that she mattered to me. And I, I really have to think you know, is this appropriate for-- is, is this actually-- where is this gonna take of me because it was really, a really strong feeling for me. And I wasn't, I knew I wasn't sympathizing, it wasn't that, that I have no sense of that. But in that moment she really mattered. And the wondering was, "Do I actually say this to her?" And it has consequences - 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:10:35
NORMA - because you know, it was, it was really hard, ridiculous. 

00:10:40
UNKNOWN And thought as it being oppression. 

00:10:40
NORMA Yeah. 

00:10:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:10:45
NORMA Yeah. 

00:10:45
UNKNOWN It was a powerful thing but - 

00:10:45
NORMA Yeah. 

00:10:45
UNKNOWN - also quite challenging, you know, and the feelings. 

00:10:55
NORMA I'm feeling judgment to what she was saying, there was no sense of that, her own-- for me. The thing that I could clock consciously you know, and then we'll go back and, and have her and then look at that. And if there's anything sort of I, I need, I need to really look up as if I put too much pressure on her and you know... 

00:11:20
UNKNOWN Right, right, with that one intervention. 

00:11:25
NORMA Yeah, what, what came from it. Yeah, because I think it really shook her, you know. 

00:11:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:11:35
NORMA Yup. 

00:11:35
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:11:35
NORMA All right.
