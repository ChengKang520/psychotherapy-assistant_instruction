CHERISH Welcome to the Natural Environment Series on Teaching Verbal Behavior, presented by Establishing Operations Incorporated. 

00:00:05
HOLLY Because we recognize the importance of teaching communication through motivation this natural environment series will focus on teaching language to your child based directly on what motivates them. 

00:00:15
CHERISH This initial DVD is focused on teaching your child their first requests or mands. You'll learn what to teach, how to teach it correctly, as well as many important problem-solving strategies. 

00:00:30
HOLLY It's our sincere hope that through watching these DVDs, you're able to teach your child how to effectively use language to communicate their wants and needs.

Mand - BALL 

00:00:45
CHERISH Before getting into the details of natural environment teaching, we want to review with you what verbal behavior is. B.F. Skinner is the author of the book 'Verbal Behavior.' In his book, he looked at the function of words, rather than their form. For example, the word ball is just one word when you look at its form, but when you're looking at its function, it has several different meanings. If a child wants a ball and says the word ball, this is called a 'mand' and means 'I want that ball.' With the mand, you are asking for the thing that you want. The function or reinforcer for saying ball in that situation is that the child gets the ball. Of all the functions we'll mention in this video, this is the only one that directly benefits the child and it's also likely the only one in which the child is gonna talk first. Another meaning of the word ball can be as a label or what Skinner referred to as a 'tact'. This is when someone says ball when they see a ball, but they don't really want it. The function or reason they say it, is to get social reinforcement from another person. Someone could also say ball is the answer to a question. We would call this an 'intraverbal'. So, if I said to my child, 'Hey, what bounces?' and he said, 'Ball.' that would be an intraverbal and yet another function of the word ball. What about when someone reads the word ball? That's yet another function. Now, if I said the word ball and my child immediately said the word ball back to me, this would be an 'echoic' and another function or meaning of the word ball. If I asked my child to go get their ball and they did, that would be what we call 'receptive' and is another meaning of the word ball. Skinner believed that you didn't truly understand the meaning or have the concept of a word until you could use it for all of its possible functions. But for this DVD, we're focusing on one meaning of the word ball, which is the 'mand' or request. Hopefully that brief tutorial on the meanings of a word will help you understand the rest of the information presented. Now we would like to explain what we believe natural environment teaching is. We'd like to clear up some misconceptions about what it is and what it isn't. The first misconception is that natural environment teaching is determined by where you are when you're teaching. This isn't true. It's defined or determine by what you're talking about. We believe that when you're talking about the thing that has value to the child you're working with in that moment, that is natural environment teaching. When all the responses the child is giving to you are related to the thing that they like right then, that's natural environment teaching. So you can see that it doesn't matter where you are, but rather what you're talking about in that moment, You could be at the table talking about things they like. You could be on the floor talking about things they like. You could even be in a swimming pool or anywhere, as long as you and the child are talking about things the child likes. Let me give you a few illustrations. Let's say Joey's at the beach, having a great time. I've got a bucket and a shovel. Joey really wants the bucket and the shovel. So I sit down with him and show him the shovel and I say to him, 'What's this?' and he tells me, 'A shovel.' Then I say, 'That's right. Now you can have it,' and I give it to him. Now I hold up the bucket and I say, 'What do you put sand in?' and he says, 'Bucket,' then I say, 'Yes, what do you want?' and he says, 'Bucket,' then I give him the bucket. This is an example of natural environment teaching, because Joey's motivated for the bucket and the shovel. All the things Joey just said were related to the bucket and the shovel. Now let's do another example. We're still at the beach with Joey and he still wants the bucket and the shovel. I'm holding the bucket and shovel and say to him, 'Clap your hands,' and he claps. I say, 'Give me a high five,' he gives me a high five. I say, 'What's your name,' he says, 'Joey,' then I give him the shovel. Then I say to him, 'Hey, tell me a color,' and he says, 'Blue,' then I give him the bucket. This particular example demonstrates intensive teaching. None of those responses that Joey just gave were related to the bucket or the shovel. Let's do one more example to make this point more clear. Joey is still at the beach and now Joey's in the water and I have a raft that Joey likes. He wants to get on the raft, so I say to him, 'Hey, tell me something that helps you float on the water,' and Joey says, 'Raft,' and then I say, 'Where do you wanna go,' and he says, ' Up,' so I pick him up and I put him on the raft. This is another example of natural environment teaching. I want to give one more scenario that to an untrained observer will look like natural environment teaching, but really it isn't. I'm giving this example as a warning for you, to make sure that it's not happening within your teaching. You may have a situation where you're still at the beach and you have the bucket and the shovel. Your child's sitting in front of you and he's picking up sand and dropping it in front of his eyes over and over again. You hold out your shovel and you say, 'What do you dig with?' and he says, 'Shovel.' So you give him the shovel. But he continues to drop sand in front of his eyes. Now you hold up the bucket and say, 'What do you put sand in?' he says, 'Bucket,' and you say, 'What do you want?' he says, 'Bucket,' and you give him the bucket. Now he has the bucket and the shovel but he's ignoring them while still dropping the sand in front of his eyes. This is not natural environment teaching. It would actually be intensive teaching without a reinforcer. The reason is the reinforcer for that child in that moment is dropping sand in front of his eyes, not the bucket or the shovel. You can see how someone watching you would probably think that's natural environment teaching, because you're talking about a bucket and a shovel. But in that moment, they were not the thing that had value. Natural environment teaching should be all about the child's motivation in the moment. This is what makes it so difficult to do. You have to think about what to teach, how to teach it and keep the motivation high for the items you're using. You also need to look for shifts in motivation levels. You don't want them to stop enjoying the activity, because then it's no longer natural environment teaching. Let's move on now and start talking specifically about how to teach the first mands or requests to our early learners. For our purposes, we classify early learners as children who are limited in the number of things they're able to ask for, or mand for, appropriately. Even if this child is able to label 1,000 items and answer loads of questions, if they cannot ask for things that they want, we would still consider them early in the natural environment. We believe, without the ability to mand for items, actions, attention and ultimately information, the child may never become conversational. When we teach our early learners in the natural environment, we want to teach them that communicating, whether it's sign or vocal, that it's fun. We want them to learn if I talk or sign, good things happen. If I talk, I get. If I sign, I get. We want to get their rate of talking or signing much higher. We recommend that early learners spend a larger portion of their therapy time in the natural environment setting. The exact percentage depends on how weak the mand repertoire is. If they're not able to ask for any items or activities they enjoy, we might even recommend that they spend all of their time in the natural environment, learning to ask for things that they want.

Teaching the First Vocal Mands 

00:08:00
HOLLY Now let's talk about all the manding skills that you'll need to teach to your early learner in the natural environment. For the purposes of this DVD, we're limiting our discussion to children who are able to use vocal as their response form. This means that they can echo what other people say, even if their echoes aren't immediate; you do commonly hear them saying words pretty clearly, just not when they want things. If you have a learner that can't ask for anything they want or maybe just a few things, but they are able to echo what you say, you'll start with what we call 'echo manding'. There's a lot of prompting involved at this stage. Echo manding is designed this way to keep the effort lower in the beginning, and then we systematically fade our prompts. When you're using the echo mand procedure, what you're teaching your child is if they say what you say, good things happen to them. That's why we call it the echo mand because it's still an echo at this stage. Now, be prepared to say the word up to three times when you do this. You're gonna pause for about two seconds between each time you say the word to give your learner a chance to say what you say. If after any presentation of the word the child says what you said, you should give him the item immediately. If that happens, I won't even continue on saying the word for the remaining three presentations. I'll stop right there and give them the item. The reinforcer for saying the name of the item, is getting the item. With the mand, the reinforcer is specific to the motivation. Let me show you what this looks like with Cherish. Notice that she really wants this soda. 'Soda. Soda.' 

00:09:40
CHERISH Soda. 

00:09:45
HOLLY And I give it to her. I didn't even have to say it the third time. As soon as she says soda, I give her the soda. Make sure you don't take the soda back and make your child ask for it again in a real-world scenario. That would make you pretty aversive to the child. If you do this, your child will learn really fast that as soon as they get the soda, they should take it and run so you can't get it back from them. A better way to do this is for you to pour only a little bit into the cup, because then after she drinks it all, she'll have to come back to me for more of the soda. This is gonna make me the giver of the good things. Now I pour a little bit more soda into the cup. She's indicating that she wants it. 'Soda.' 

00:10:25
CHERISH Soda. 

00:10:25
Automatic Reinforcement 

00:10:25
1. Child CAN echo 

00:10:25
2. Child IS motivated for the item 

00:10:25
HOLLY And I give it to her right away. Now she echoed on the first presentation of the word soda. Now what do you do if the child doesn't echo your prompt at all? Let's demonstrate this for you. Cherish is indicating that she wants more of the soda, so I'm gonna run this procedure again. I pour a little more soda into the cup. I hold it up and present the word as a prompt, 'Soda. Soda. Soda.' And I give it to her anyway, even if she doesn't echo me at all after the third time, I'm still gonna give her the soda regardless. Here's why. At this point in time, talking is hard for your early learner. If it wasn't hard, we wouldn't be working on echo mands in the first place. And if it wasn't hard, they would be talking. You wouldn't even have to start here. So I don't want to teach her that talking is any harder than she already thinks it is. If I can just give it to her anyway and then while she's drinking it I say, ' Soda. Soda. Soda,' I may actually get the effects of what is called automatic reinforcement. Essentially, by saying the word soda during this process, I'm pairing the word soda with the thing that she likes. So every time she hears the word soda in her ears, it's paired with the thing that she really likes. Now what might happen is that the word soda, the actual word itself, becomes what's called a condition reinforcer. Now because the word has been paired, she actually likes to hear the word. What better way to hear it, then to say it? She babbles, she starts to babble into sounds that sound like soda. She selects those sounds over other sounds and that's how she learns how to talk. This is how we all learned how to talk. Our mom came to us when we were little and said, 'Here's your bottle,' and we got our bottle. If that's what your mom always said when she gave you your bottle, you would have started to babble into things that sounded like bottle, ba-ba, ba-wa, and so on. Babies start to do that. They select those sounds over others sounds and that's how they learn how to talk. If you came to your child and let's say there was formula in the bottle and you never said the word formula, do you think your child's gonna start babbling into the word formula? No. They wouldn't do that because they never heard the word formula. That word hasn't been paired with the things that they like. This is the same reason why people who live in France speak French and why we speak English; it's how people develop accents depending upon the part of the country that they live in. The accent is paired with reinforcement and therefore, they pick it up; it becomes a condition reinforcer. Now think about this, some people will say, 'Well, if we're gonna give it to her anyway after the third time, then isn't our child just gonna learn to wait it out?' Here's why that doesn't happen. First, you have to remember that these are children who can echo what you say. It might not be super easy, but they can echo. Second, remember that the motivation is present. The child wants what you have. Think about this, when kids want things don't they want them right now? They don't wanna wait until after the third time you say it. Waiting until after the third you say it might really cause a 9 or a 10 second delay to pass before they actually get the item. So if they're really motivated they start to learn the faster I say what you say, the faster I get what I want. And that is why this procedure is so effective, even though we'll still give them the item after the third time, regardless of whether or not they say it. If your child is waiting you out every single time and is not attempting to say the word, this might indicate some other, kind of, motivation problem going on. The motivation for the thing that you have might not be as strong as you think. The demand of being prompted to say the word could actually be killing the value of the item, which would indicate that you need to pair your presence with reinforcement more. In some cases, it could be an indication that they aren't ready for this procedure. Maybe they aren't talking frequently enough yet and alternative procedures might be needed before you can go here. Now let's go back to our demonstration. You'll eventually get to the point where your child will echo you on the first presentation consistently, when they're motivated. Here's what this looks like. 'Soda.' 

00:14:40
CHERISH Soda. 

00:14:45
HOLLY And I give it her right away. Let me show you some videos at this level so you can see what this looks like with actual children. The first video is going to be of Jack. Jack's a little boy who lives in Chicago. He has an interesting history. Jack had a full-blown program going and at some point, someone said they heard Jack talk. Because of this the program was set up where people would approach Jack with things that he really wanted and then they would just say the name of the item over and over and over again hoping that he would say it. The problem here was that he didn't say it. Initially what would happen is that if you walked up to Jack with something good, he would just start to cry. It was hard for him to talk. He couldn't speak on command and he rarely did get the items that he wanted because he never said the word. Jack learned that adults were correlated with demands and that they were not fun to be around. And Jack also learned was that when someone came to him with something really good, bad things were about to happen. Well, when Jack's parents told me about this history, I realized that the first thing I needed to do was pair myself with good things so that Jack would approach me and ultimately allow me to work with him. We spent Jack's first consult teaching him that wherever the therapists were, that's where the fun was. We wanted Jack to learn that good things happen when he's around us. It actually took over a month to completely pair ourselves we reinforcement. After we successfully paired with reinforcement then we could start teaching Jack to ask for things. Now since we still hadn't heard Jack talk on a regular basis to request things, we started teaching him using sign language. Over time and through the use of some consistent procedures the signs dropped out as the vocals improved. And this is where we're at in the video that I'm about to show you. In this video Jack is able to echo fairly well but he's still not able to independently ask for many items. What you'll see is that we're running the echo mand procedure. Let's watch Jack's therapist teach him. Now watch for the number on the screen. This number will show you how many times the therapist had to say the word, before Jack echoed her. 

00:16:55

00:16:55
1...2 

00:16:55
HOLLY Okay you just heard jack say 'upside-down' and then the therapist flipped him upside-down, which he likes. The reinforcer for saying upside-down was the therapist flipping him over. Now she's gonna pick him back up and say, 'You went upside-down!' These words that she'll say are actually prompts for the next trial. Keep watching for those numbers on the screen so that you can see how many prompts are required before he says the word.

00:17:30
Fill In 

00:17:30
Two Indicators of Motivation 

00:17:30
1. Volume 

00:17:30
2. Latency 

00:17:30
HOLLY Notice how she tried the three times and then she finally, kind of, tricked Jack into saying it by doing a fill in the blank. She said, 'Upside...' and he filled in the word down. Now there's something important to note that the therapist missed in the moment. This is very important to remember. Two possible indicators of the strength of the motivation are volume and latency. Latency means how quickly he said it and volume is how softly or loudly he said it. Now when you really want something, aren't you a lot louder? Case in point, when your kids are in the car and they want ice cream, they don't whisper 'ice cream' they say it loud and if you don't hear them and you don't listen it gets louder the next time they ask. When you really want something your volume is louder too. If you're not interested in talking to the person that you're talking to you, sometimes your latencies will be long. Just like volume, latency can give us cues or clues into motivation. And that's what happened here with Jack. The first time he echoed the word, it was on the second presentation. The next time he echoed the word after the first presentation. So the latency got shorter there. This time, even after the third presentation, he still didn't say 'down'. She had to, sort of, trick him into it with that fill-in the blank prompt. This gives us a clue that maybe Jack doesn't want to go upside-down anymore. I would think that being flipped upside-down would be similar to being tickled; the first few seconds of being tickled are fun but it becomes aversive very quickly. You need to watch for this when you're teaching. If your child doesn't want to go upside-down and you're flipping him upside-down anyway, that can be aversive; and if you're making him ask for it when he doesn't want it, that's the opposite of manding. The therapist is this video is smart. She's very talented. She recognizes that Jack was not motivated there and now she's gonna do something different right here. Let's see what she does. 

00:19:50
[sil.] 

00:19:50
HOLLY Now, see right here. The therapist thought, let's try something else. She said, 'Should we spin?' and then she gave him some little spins on purpose to see if he was gonna like it first. When Jack seemed like he liked the spinning, then she gave him a big spin. Now notice that she didn't try to make him say spin here. This is because she didn't know yet if he was motivated to spin or not in that exact moment. If you're not sure if your child wants the thing, you don't want to ask him to say it yet. You need to do this with all of your kids. Give things for free at first and then when you know that they're motivated, then you can prompt the mand. Now, after the free big spin you just saw, she stops and she waits. If she feels Jack give her any indication at all that he wants to keep spinning, then she's gonna ask him to say it. That's when she's pretty sure that the motivation is present. Let's see if he wants it. 

00:20:45
[sil.] 

00:20:50
HOLLY He didn't want it, so she went to something else. 

00:20:55
[sil.] 

00:20:55
HOLLY She gave him down for free two times. Now she's noticing that he liked it. So now she's going to prompt him by telling him the word to say. Watch for those numbers on the screen again.

00:21:20
HOLLY He said it first. 

00:21:25
[sil.] 

00:21:25
Differential Reinforcement 

00:21:25
HOLLY He said it first again. He's actually beating her to the prompt here. Jack's saying the word first. When that happens, if at all possible, you wanna do what's called differential reinforcement. Differential reinforcement is an important concept that you're gonna hear us talk a lot about. When a child engages in behavior that's better than past attempts, you wanna make sure that that child gets more reinforcement for that response. One way of doing this could be to give more of the reinforcer they're asking for. So maybe drop Jack down twice or if he was asking for chips, give him two chips instead of just one chip. Another way to do this is to give access to the reinforcer for a longer period of time or a longer duration. So if the reinforcer was a movie, for example, you could let them watch it for a little bit longer than you usually would. This would help increase the future frequency of the better responses because they get more reinforcement for them. Just make sure that the thing that you reinforce with is specific to the motivation. So, in the first video when Jack said down first, the therapist could've given Jack more of the good thing for all the response effort that he gave. Maybe she could have picked him up and dropped him back down a few times without prompting him to ask her. We want all of our kids talking first more often. So try to make it more fun in some way when they mand independently. Now, in this next part I want you to watch what happens to Jack's latency in responding. Watch the numbers on the bottom of the screen. Each of these numbers will indicate the number of times that the therapist had to prompt before Jack manded. 

00:23:05

00:23:05
1...1...2 

00:23:05
Go For Quality Over Quantity 

00:23:05
HOLLY Right there, did you see how the therapist didn't even try to say the word a third time. The reason she didn't even try for the third time was that just seconds before this part of the video Jack was saying down first. He didn't even need her to prompt him at all. Then the next part I showed you, he needed one prompt, then he needed two prompts; his responses are getting slower. This is an indication that the motivation is weakening. So the therapist doesn't even try to say the word a third time because she knows that he doesn't want it as much anymore. She then just goes on to something else. This gives us another important guideline about manding. Go for quality over quantity. Keep that motivation high. So now on this part of the video, she's gonna jump with him for free. Notice that she isn't gonna make him ask for it until she knows that he wants it. 

00:24:10

00:24:35
Fading the Vocal Prompts 

00:24:35
HOLLY Once you're at the point where when you give the child the prompt, as long as they're motivated and they echo you on the first presentation consistently, that's when you're ready to start fading. You don't want to stay at the level of echo manding forever. You want the child to be able to ask for items when they want them, period, nothing else. Not just when they want them and you tell them what to say. 

00:25:00
Two Ways to Fade Echoic Prompt 

00:25:00
HOLLY There are two ways you can fade out your echoic prompt. The first one is the procedure that we like the best. We like this way the best mostly because there's less effort required from your learner. When the effort required from your learner stays low, often the motivation can stay high. It also prevents a problem that we'll discuss later, when we tell you about other ways that you can fade. 

00:25:20
The First Way to Fade the Echoic Prompt: Fading by Time 

00:25:20
HOLLY The first way to fade is by time. Don't start this procedure until your child is easily able to echo you on the first presentation, when running the echo mand procedure. Now when you're ready to start, you'll run an echo mand trial and then you'll start to fade by waiting for the mand on the subsequent trials, when the motivation is strong. Here's what this might look like. Now it's easy for Cherish to echo me. So I run the echo mand procedure and then I wait by time on the next trial. "Soda." 

00:25:50
CHERISH Soda. 

00:25:55
[sil.] 

00:25:55
CHERISH Soda. 

00:25:55
When NOT to fade by time: 

00:25:55
1. Not enough teaching 

00:25:55
2. Child gets frustrated 

00:25:55
3. Child will make a mistake 

00:26:00
HOLLY And I can give her some soda. Now teaching in the natural environment is different than teaching in the intensive teaching environment. When we teach intensively we recommend very quick prompts, but when it comes to manding you can wait sometimes nine or even 10 seconds before prompting to try to get your child to say it independently. Sometimes we have to do this with the mand in order for the child to be able to mand independently. The only times you do not want to run this procedure is if number one, you haven't done enough teaching yet, so the child isn't gonna know what to say if you're waiting. Number two, if the child's gonna get frustrated or upset. Or number three, if the child's going to say the wrong word and make a mistake. When you've done enough teaching and your child will likely be successful with this procedure that is when we'll use it. Now let's watch some video demonstrations of fading by time with children. David is a little boy who lives in Toronto. In this first clip, David's learned to echo mand and Denise is trying to teach him to talk first. In this video you're about to see, David is really enjoying these little pieces that go inside of his toy. These are actually little hippos. Denise is going to run the echo mand procedure to prompt him and then she's gonna start feeding her prompts a little bit to see if David can ask for the hippos on his own after a few trials. Let's watch Denise run the procedure of fading by time. 

00:27:25
[sil.] 

00:27:25
HOLLY Right here, David said hippo because Denise said hippo first. Now watch Denise fade her prompts. 

00:27:40
[sil.] 

00:27:40
HOLLY That time Denise said 'hi-' and he said hippo. That's one way you can fade out your prompts. We call that a phonemic prompt or a partial prompt. You can just say a part of the word, which helped David to say the whole word and then he got the item. One thing you wanna watch for with some children is that if you say 'hi-' the child will say ' hi-' right back to you. if that happens, you can't use this procedure. With David phonemic prompts work really well. Denise said 'hi-' and he said hippo. On the next trial she can either say 'hi-' again, if she thinks he needs another prompt to be successful, or she can wait and not say anything at all. Let's see what she does. 

00:28:20
[sil.] 

00:28:20
HOLLY She waited and he said it. Now remember what we should do when the child mands independently for the first time? Differentially reinforce. So Denise could've given him two or three hippos instead of just one. That actually says good job to your child even more powerfully than the verbal praise alone. That's because it's specific to the motivation. Now, in this next video, I'll show you David again. This time David's on Denise's back and Denise is walking around with him. Denise is getting her exercise today. Now Denise is trying to fade by time across all echo mands. So this time, she's gonna use the same procedure for the mand of the walk. 

00:29:10
[sil.] 

00:29:10
HOLLY When David echoes the word walk, Denise walks. And then when Denise stops the motivation starts to build for her to keep walking. Let's now watch Denise try to fade by time. Notice how she won't prompt at all and instead she's just gonna wait. 

00:29:30
[sil.] 

00:29:30
HOLLY He said it first this time. Let's watch him say it first some more. 

00:29:40
[sil.] 

00:29:40
HOLLY Let's watch another video clip with Denise and David. This time the activity he's enjoying is having her push him around in a chair. Denise is teaching the two word mand of push chair. And she's ready to fade her prompts. 

00:30:00
[sil.] 

00:30:10
HOLLY Now notice how Denise gave a couple of pushes for free in the beginning to make sure that he was enjoying the activity before she prompted him. This brings up another good point. It doesn't matter what level of manding your child is at. You still need to give a little bit for free to make sure they really want the item before you require the mand. What if David liked this activity yesterday but then he didn't even want to do it today? You have to test that first. So let's watch some more video. In this part of the clip, I want you to pay attention to how Denise provides David with two full vocal prompts, followed by two trials with phonemic prompts to get him to say the whole word. 

00:30:50
[sil.] 

00:31:20
HOLLY Now that Denise taught two trials use phonemic prompts, she thinks she's done enough teaching. So this time let's watch her try to fade her prompts by time. 

00:31:30
[sil.] 

00:31:30
HOLLY He said it all by himself. Now watch how long Denise pushes him. This is differential reinforcement. 

00:31:45
[sil.] 

00:31:45
Errorless Teaching 

00:31:45
HOLLY Now, right here, did you see how she had to go back in with that partial prompt right there? Even though Denise didn't have to give a prompt at all on the last one, David didn't mand this time. Denise waited and she knows exactly how long she can wait before David's either gonna say the wrong thing or get upset. So she gave him that phonemic prompt of 'pu-' to make sure he wouldn't make a mistake. This was errorless teaching. Errorless teaching is preventing errors from happening in the first place. It's not fixing errors after they happen. If we can provide prompts to our learners to make sure they're successful and then fade out those prompts gradually, they'll learn faster than if they're wrong and then we have to fix it, than they're wrong and we fix it, over and over again. 

00:32:40
[sil.] 

00:32:40
HOLLY Now just because Denise was able to fade to where she didn't have to prompt at all today, that doesn't mean she's gonna be able to come in tomorrow and not say anything at all. She might be able to come in tomorrow and say nothing and David might mand, but chances are good the he's gonna need some more prompting and some more fading across different sessions before it truly becomes an independent mand. 

00:33:25
[sil.] 

00:33:25
The Second Way to Fade the Echoic Prompt: Echoic to Mand Transfer 

00:33:25
HOLLY Now let's talk about another way we can fade our prompts. This way is called the echoic to mand transfer procedure. With this one, what you're doing is you're requiring your child to say the word twice before they get the thing that they want. So if I was running this procedure and I wanted my child to learn to ask for juice without me saying it first, I would first provide an echo mand trial. So I would say 'juice' and my child would echo and say 'juice' but before I give him the juice, I want to get my child to say it one more time by himself. If he says it that one last time by himself, then I'd give him the juice. What I'd be reinforcing would be the child actually saying the word more independently. That's called the echoic to mand transfer procedure. Let me show you this with Cherish. "Juice." 

00:34:15
CHERISH Juice. Juice. 

00:34:20
HOLLY There's a few variations of this procedure. Another way you can do it that is really the same but it just looks a little bit different, would be if I said something to her on the transfer trial. Here's what this would look like. " Juice." 

00:34:35
CHERISH Juice. 

00:34:35
HOLLY "What do you want?" 

00:34:35
CHERISH Juice. 

00:34:35
Use error correction for: 

00:34:35
1. Double talk 

00:34:35
2. Saying wrong word 

00:34:35
3. Scrolling 

00:34:35
HOLLY And then I can give it to her. Now this might look a little more natural to you than the first demonstration where I just waited. But the problem is that if you always say something first such as, 'What do you want,' the child might learn that they have to wait for you to say something first before they can mand. It doesn't matter what you say. Instead of saying, 'What do you want,' you can say, 'Huh,' or 'Pardon me,' or 'What' and it wouldn't matter because your child may still learn that they have to wait for you to say something before they can ask for something that they want. It's okay to say something sometimes on the transfer trial. Asking 'What do you want' isn't a bad thing, but just make sure you don't always say it. Maybe set a percentage for yourself so that you're sure not to say something first more than 50% of the time. Remember that I mentioned earlier that there may be a negative consequence of fading this way? For some children, this procedure's great but for a few they learn that they have to say the name of the item two times before they can have it. This can produce what we call double talk. When the motivation is present, the child starts to say it twice when they want it. For example, they'd say 'Water, water,' 'Juice, juice,' 'Movie, movie.' You don't want that to happen. If that happens, we're gonna treat it like an error and then we'll run our error correction procedure. We run this procedure if they double talk, if they say the wrong word or even if they say the wrong word followed by the right word, which is actually known as scrolling. In all of those examples, we're still gonna use the same procedure. Here's how the procedures run. If my child makes an error of any sort, I'd hold up my hand as a signal that I did hear him, but he has to wait. Then I'm gonna get about two seconds of silence from him and then I'd prompt the right word. Let me show you an example of this. 

00:36:30
CHERISH Juice. Juice. 

00:36:30
HOLLY I don't want to give it to her right there. If I reinforce that by giving her the juice, I'll have just reinforced her repetitive talking of 'juice, juice.' What I want to do here is hold up my hand for her to wait, get a couple of seconds of quiet, then prompt the word. Here's what that looks like. 

00:36:45
CHERISH Juice. Juice. 

00:36:50
HOLLY Juice. 

00:36:50
CHERISH Juice. 

00:36:50
HOLLY Now I can give it to her. She how all that was ultimately reinforced was her saying the word just one time. Here's another example of an error that's not double talking, but you'd use the same exact procedure here, as well. This time, Cherish wants the juice but she makes a different type of error. Watch this one. 

00:37:10
CHERISH Dog. 

00:37:10
HOLLY Clearly she doesn't want a dog. It's obvious that she wants the juice. She's reaching for it. If I immediately prompt juice right here, she might end up chaining together dog juice. The next time she wants juice she's likely to say dog juice. I don't want that to happen, so I'm gonna run this same procedure again. Let's watch it. 

00:37:35
CHERISH Dog. 

00:37:35
HOLLY Juice. 

00:37:35
CHERISH Juice. 

00:37:35
HOLLY Now I can give her the juice. Some people ask us, 'Well, why wouldn't you just give her the dog since that's what she said.' You wouldn't want to do that, because this is not errorless teaching. Clearly she doesn't want the dog, she wants the juice. Just get the error out of there and prompt the right word and then give her the item. That is what's gonna help her learn faster. Let me show you a video of this. This video will be Jennifer working with Michael in Canada. They're just walking down the street and Jen's pulling Michael in a wagon. In this clip Jen's using that echoic to mand transfer procedure to fade out her vocal prompts on the mand for pull. Let's watch this. 

00:38:20
[sil.] 

00:38:20
HOLLY Now Jen said, 'Pull' and Michael said, ' Hip pull'. She said, 'What,' and he again said, 'Hip pull' on the transfer trial. That's where Jen realized that Michael was not saying pull. He was saying something else. As soon as Jennifer realized this, she ran the error correction procedure immediately. She got a couple of seconds of quiet from him and she said, 'Pull, Pu-' and he said 'Pull' with her phonemic prompt. And then she did a transfer trial by saying, 'What,' and he said, 'Pull' all by himself. Then she started to pull him. I'm gonna show you this again from the start so that you can see what I'm talking about. 

00:39:10
[sil.] 

00:39:10
HOLLY Notice Michael is saying, 'Hip pull,' while they're walking down the street? He's actually practicing the error to himself. He's just saying it to himself as, sort of, a vocal stem. Now this clues Jen in that Michael's likely to say, 'Hip pull,' when she stops him. So now she's expecting that he's gonna say the wrong thing. So she's able to use this to her advantage. So the next time she stops the wagon, she knows she needs to prompt immediately before he can say, 'Hip pull.' You'll hear her right here stressing the word to make sure he says it correctly and to keep him from saying it the wrong way. 

00:40:00
[sil.] 

00:40:05
HOLLY Even though she prompted him errorlessly, he still snuck in staying, ' Hip pull' on that first trial there. So she tried again. Jen said, 'Pull, pull' and Michael said, 'Pull.' On the next trial, now she's gonna provide an phonemic prompt to see if he can mand.

00:40:25
Review: Two Ways to Fade Prompts 

00:40:25
1. Echoic to Mand Transfer 

00:40:25
2. Fading by Time 

00:40:30
HOLLY Okay, so now we know how to fade our vocal prompts two different ways. One way is the echoic to mand transfer and then the second way is fading by time. I want to repeat that if you use fading by time, you're more likely to keep the motivation high, because it requires less response effort from your child. And you're more likely to avoid double talk with this procedure, as well. The echoic to mand transfer procedure is certainly not a wrong way to fade, we just want you to be aware of both procedures and then possible problems, so that if you encounter any problems you know why you're having them and how to fix them. 

00:41:05
Fading "What Do You Want?" 

00:41:05
HOLLY Let's now talk about how to fade out talking first for those children who need you to talk first in order to be able to mand. Examples of this are children who need you say, 'What do you want,' or some similar phrase in order to be able to ask for things. If you followed our recommendations and not always talked first on the transfer trial when you're teaching these mands initially, you probably won't have this problem. However, this is a common problem and sometimes you meet children who are already dependent on hearing somebody else talk first to be able to ask for things. If this is the case, you have to fix it, or they may never ever be able to truly mand independently. You can actually use the fading by time procedure that we previously talked about to fade out the 'What do you want' prompt. As always, you have to come to your child with something that they want, but this time choose something that the child wants a lot of. For example, I could come up to my child with some potato chips. And let's say he wants a lot of them. So I hold up my first chip. Now I know he's not able to ask for the chip, unless I either say, "What do you want," or if I model the word and I say chip. Remember I'm trying to get rid of the "What do you want" prompt, so I'm not gonna say it. I go back to that full prompt and I say 'Chip,' he says, ' Chip' and then I give him the chip. Now on the next one, again, I say 'Chip' he says, "Chip," I give him the next chip. Now I give him some time to eat that one and he wants another one. Now I might try phonemic prompt. I hold up the chip and I say, 'Ch-,' he says, 'Chip,' I give him that chip. Then on the next trial now I can try waiting and not saying anything at all to see if he can say chip. If he says chip I'm gonna give him a couple of chips so I can differentially reinforce him just for asking independently. Maybe I'll even let him stick his whole hand in the bag and get his own chips. Now after this, you're probably not going to have to prompt him again for any more chips in the bag that's in front of you in that moment. However, please don't think you've completely fixed the problem. You're likely going to need to start at the beginning again the next time that he wants some more chips. 

00:43:20
Fading the Presence of the Item 

00:43:25
[sil.] 

00:43:25
HOLLY Now let's talk about the last prompts that we need to fade. In order for a mand to be truly spontaneous, there should be no prompts present. So at this point in time we have a child who when he wants something and he sees it, he can asked for it, no problem at all. Now we need to fade out the presence of the item itself. We want our kids to be able to mand under the same controlling variables that we mand, which is just because we want something. We don't have to see a pizza to know that we want pizza. When we want it, we just ask for it. We want our kids to be able to do the exact same thing as this. So we need to teach them to ask for things when they're not present. Now to do this you don't wanna just take everything away, put it in the closet and then expect them to ask for stuff. Most of our children cannot make that big of a jump. And if you did that, it would increase the demand level and possibly cause you to lose all the mands you previously taught them. Instead you want to systematically fade out the presence of the item. And to make sure you aren't teaching this too soon, we'll usually start teaching the procedure with just two items. And we try to only choose items that are very valuable and that the child wants a lot of; food is good for this, uh, so are toys that the child wants, um, things like matchbox cars, bubbles, maybe even puzzle pieces or something similar. Let's talk about what the teaching procedure would look like. If we want our child to ask for a cookie when he wants it, and not just when he wants it and he sees it. We would start at the level that is the easiest for him. So we might hold it up and let him ask for it first. After he eats this one, then we'll try to systematically fade the presence of the item. Let me show you a video of this. This next video is a little boy named David. Now David can ask for French fries when they're present with no problem at all. David's therapist is sitting with him and she has the whole container of French fries. Now when he sees a fry, he can easily ask for one. So she's gonna start there where it's easy for him. When he asks for a fry, she's gonna give him one and then she's gonna give him time to eat it and then some more time for the motivation to build again so that he wants another. 

00:45:50
[sil.] 

00:45:50
HOLLY Did you see what she did with the fry container? He asked for the fry when it was present and now she pulled the container off to the side of her body where he can't see it as well. And now she waits. 

00:46:20
[sil.] 

00:46:20
HOLLY He asked for it. You can see that she gave him a fry and then now watch to see where she puts the fries. She's gonna move them even further out of sight so that she's gradually fading them away completely. 

00:46:35
[sil.] 

00:46:35
HOLLY He asked for the fry. So she gave him a fry. Notice that the latency was a little bit longer that time, but that was harder for him. And it's harder for our kids to make that jump from asking for things when they're present to asking for them when they're gone, as well. You really have to do this systematically and fade it out the way we're seeing in this video. Let's see what she does with her hands now. 

00:47:05
[sil.] 

00:47:05
HOLLY Just having your hand behind your back like that becomes a prompt that the child might actually need to be able to ask for the item. That's why the therapist left the fries behind her and then brought her hands in front of herself in a natural position. If you don't fade to natural conditions, your child might not be able to ask for things in the natural setting. Now after it's easy for David to ask for fries in this setting, his therapist can fade even further so that he can ask for a fry when he's two steps away from her. And then later so he can ask for fries when he's another room. But every fade has to be systematically chosen so that it isn't too hard of a jump for that child. We want our kids to be successful. Now, when this therapist was fading, if at any point in time David had wanted the fry but he wasn't able to ask for one. The prompt would not be her voice. The prompt would actually be to either flash the fries or go back to an earlier fade where David was successful. For example, if he can't ask for the fries when her hands were in front of her body, she could just move to the last stage where he was successful and see if just putting her hands behind her back would evoke the correct mand. The important thing here is that you want to rely on the item or your hands to do the prompting for you and not on your voice. It's harder to fade out your voice than these other types of prompts. Now one last important note about this procedure is that if at any point in time the child loses their motivation for the item, you need to stop teaching it. Remember, it's only a mand if the motivation's present. If the child isn't motivated, move to teaching something that is motivating and then just come back to work on fading to the motivation at a later time when he does want it. 

00:49:10
Manding Guidelines 

00:49:15
CHERISH Now let's talk about some guidelines to teaching the first mands. 

00:49:15
Manding is Natural Environment Teaching. 

00:49:20
[sil.] 

00:49:20
CHERISH The first thing to know is that when you're teaching the mand repertoire you are teaching in the natural environment. Remember that when a child is manding they are asking for the thing that they want. So this is talking about the thing that has value to your child in that moment. So it doesn't matter if you're at the table, on the floor or wherever, it's still natural environment teaching. 

00:49:40
Motivation must be present before prompting the mand. 

00:49:45
[sil.] 

00:49:45
CHERISH This next point is a very important one. Make sure your child is motivated before you prompt them to mand. If you prompt your child to mand and they're not motivated for the item that's actually the opposite of manding. You also want to make sure the motivation is high so watch for those shifts in volume and latency. 

00:50:00
Practice teaching mands before you teach your child. 

00:50:05
[sil.] 

00:50:05
CHERISH Be sure to practice teaching mands before you go in and start doing this with your child. If you don't practice, you are likely to make your mistakes on the child and they might get upset. While you're trying to figure out what you're doing you might actually be delaying their reinforcement. Practice with other adults or with typically developing children who are more able to tolerate your mistakes, then come to your child knowing how to teach. 

00:50:30
Teach mands in a variety of locations. 

00:50:35
[sil.] 

00:50:35
CHERISH You want to try to teach each mand in different places. If you teach your child to mand for all their favorite things in one room of your home, every day, and never leave that room, your child will be able to ask for all kinds of things in that room. But some kids when you leave the room they won't be able to ask for anything. This happened with a client Holly works with in Bermuda named Michael. When we did his beginning manding, we did all of his teaching in the basement of his home; that's where his therapy room was. Well, his manding came along really well and he was able to ask for all kinds of things that he wanted. One day, Holly was in their home working with Michael's brother Richard, who is also a child with autism. Well, they were in the living room and Michael walks upstairs from the basement. He sees a piece of chocolate sitting on the counter. He starts to reach for it, but he can't reach it. Well, they didn't think anything of it and kept working with Richard. Well, Michael keeps reaching and reaching and finally they hear him start going, 'eh, eh' and making all these noises trying to get to his chocolate. But he can't get it. Suddenly he throws himself down and has a full-blown tantrum on the kitchen floor. This was a huge red flag because Michael could ask for chocolate when he wanted it. Don't you think it would take a lot less effort just to say chocolate, than it would to throw this huge tantrum? That takes a lot of effort. So Holly went over and grabbed the chocolate and walked down the stairs to the basement. Of course Michael followed her. He really wanted that chocolate. So as soon as they hit the basement floor, Michael said, 'Chocolate,' clear as day. This was a signal that there was a huge problem. At that moment, they actually put Richard's consult on hold and started to address this manding issue with Michael. They had to set it up so that his teaching occurred in many environments. I know that many people are limited in the space they have to do their teaching, just be aware of this issue and do your best to make sure that all people in the child's life are teaching these mands across environments. 

00:52:35
Capture and contrive many opportunities each day to teach mands. 

00:52:40
[sil.] 

00:52:40
CHERISH Next, be sure to capture and contrive as many opportunities a day as you possibly can to teach those mands. You do not want to sit around and wait for these things to happen. If you just sit around and wait for your child to be motivated, you might get 20 or 30 mands in the whole day; it's not enough. If we wanna catch our children up with their typically developing peers, we have to get them talking at least as much as that peer. Most children without delays talk thousands of times per day, don't we know it. If we want our children to talk many times per day, we have to set those situations up. We have to contrive motivation at least hundreds of times per day. It's not as hard as you might think. Let's say your child enjoys playing with puzzles. You can take out a puzzle, take the puzzle pieces out and lay that puzzle board on the floor with just a few of the pieces. If your child likes puzzles, they'll likely come running over. You've just contrived motivation for your child to put the puzzle pieces in. Another example, you might walk into the room with a bag of their favorite chips, open it, and shake it. Now they want those chips. Two seconds ago, they didn't want chips. But now they look up and they want them. You contrived the motivation. After they eat some chips, now they're likely to be thirsty. Bring out that drink. You just contrived another motivation. We recommend between three and 800 minutes per day depending on the amount of time you have to teach. The number you target each day will also depend on the strength of that child's motivation. Remember that we prefer quality over quantity. You can get thousands of mands where the child really doesn't care and those aren't as good as just getting hundreds where a child is highly motivated. 

00:54:25
Track the number of mands each day. 

00:54:30
[sil.] 

00:54:30
CHERISH Now, since we are targeting so many mands per day there's really no way to keep track of this in your head, so we recommend using tally counters or those frequency counters to track as you go along. Some people wear them around their neck, others wear them on their belts. The way we take frequency data on our mands, depends entirely on what the mand target is. If we're teaching beginning mands, we're probably going to be counting prompted and unprompted mands, but at some point we might change our data and start tracking mands without the item present or mands with more than one word, but all of this will depend on the level of the child. This next guideline may be the most important one. 

00:55:10
Be a giver and not a taker. 

00:55:10
CHERISH Be a giver, not a taker. Being a taker would be if I gave a child the whole bottle of juice and then took it back to get another mand. Being a giver would be giving her a small amount in a cup and then she has to come back to me to get more. Here's another scenario for you. What some people might do is put out a bunch of different toys on the floor for their session. They've got the bus over here with all the little people. They have a puzzle here with all the pieces out, and over here they have out a bunch of blocks. So now they go in to start their session. The child runs over to the little people in the bus. So the therapist comes running over, 'Oh, you wanna play with the little people.' They take the bus, dump all the little people in their lap, they give the bus back to the child and start making that child asks for all those little people. This kids like, 'Wait a minute. Things were good before you came along. I had all the little people and you just took them from me. I'm leaving.' So off he goes running to play with the puzzle that's laying out. He starts putting the pieces in. So the therapist comes running over, 'Oh, now you want to play with the puzzle.' And they dump the pieces on their lap and now they start making the child ask for all of those puzzle pieces. This is the same thing again, this kid is not sticking around. Now he's off to the blocks. You can see in this scenario that the therapist is a taker, not a giver. If someone didn't know any better they might actually save to you, this natural environment teaching stuff just doesn't work. But really, the problem is that the therapist is killing the value of the items by being a taker. You can take that same situation, but now you can be a giver. Put the bus on the floor, but only leave out one or two little people. Put the rest of the little people in a bag up high where only you can get to it. Get your puzzle out, take all the pieces out before your child gets there. Put them in a bag on the shelf; maybe leave out one or two pieces. And with the blocks, just put out one or two blocks. Now when your child comes in and runs over to the bus and puts in the little people, you can over and say, 'Oh, you wanna play with the bus.' Because now you have all the little people and you can have the child ask for them. Here you're a giver of the little people. He couldn't get them without you; same thing with the puzzle. He runs over and puts in the pieces that are out and this signals to you that he wants to do that puzzle; you contrived the motivation. So now you can come over with the rest of the pieces. You're a giver. Same thing with the blocks. 

00:57:35
Sanitize the environment so that you can control your reinforcers. 

00:57:40
[sil.] 

00:57:45
CHERISH This example brings us to our next point which is to sanitize the environment. Now what we mean by this is that you need to set up the environment strategically, so that you are not gonna be a taker. Have things set up so you know what's out and how you can make each activity better when you come over. In the meantime, whatever is not being used, keep it out of reach of that child because let's say you the pirate ship out and there other things out too, but you're not planning to use them for that session. Well, if the child sees it, they may run over and start playing with it. If the environment isn't sanitized you will not be able to control your reinforcers during your session, and this is not conducive to teaching. 

00:58:20
Avoid killing the motivation. 

00:58:25
[sil.] 

00:58:25
CHERISH Another point is to avoid killing motivation. With some children, if you make them ask for every little thing, that is enough to kill the motivation. Even though this child may want all the little people for the bus, if you make them ask for each one, that might just be too many demands for that child. Too much effort is required. You might have to set it up with some children so that when they ask for one thing, they always get another one or two for free. Always be watching that you're not killing the motivation. Sometimes you're not even sure what you're doing that's killing the motivation. That can happen. You think you're doing everything by the book, and you might be, but suddenly your child, who previously loved that pirate ship, doesn't like it anymore. You might be tempted just to think, 'Ah, well, he just changes his mind a lot. He might like it one day and not the next. I guess he's just tired of the pirate ship.' But what might be really happening is that the value of the toys are being killed. You may be killing the value of them. You're not intending to, you don't mean to, but sometimes whatever it is that you're doing with those toys is just too much response effort for your child. It makes it so that the toy is not fun anymore. The child may not want to go near them. If that's the case and you think that might have happened what you can do is give those things for free for a while with no demands at all. Sometimes if you do this, over the course of a couple of days, they start to enjoy the toys again. If that happens, then we know it was something we did that killed the value of that item. That's half the battle, just knowing that you killed the value. The second half of the battle is figuring out how you killed it, because however you did it, you don't want to do it again. 

01:00:10
Remember to fade your prompts. 

01:00:15
CHERISH Next, try to get the best quality response with the least amount of prompting. You should always be trying to fade your prompts. If you try to fade too soon, you will know, because the child will increase their errors. If this happens, just go back a step and prompt some more. As we've mentioned, we prefer errorless teaching. When fading remember to differentially reinforce, remember the less prompting we have to do, the more reinforcement we're gonna to get. Keep in mind if your child needs more prompting than usual or maybe they're making more errors than usual, check to see if this is a motivation issue rather than a prompt fading issue. It may just be that they don't want the item or the activity as much and you need to move on to another activity. 

01:00:55
Avoid placing unnecessary demands on your child while teaching mands. 

01:01:00
[sil.] 

01:01:05
CHERISH When you're teaching mands don't ask unnecessary questions to your child during the activity. This includes asking them to label things, give you items, or even suggesting they play with their toy a certain way. Sometimes we don't even realize were placing these demands on our child, but even just saying, 'Hey, Joey, why don't you put your car on the ramp?' That's a demand to Joey and it might actually kill the value of that car. If you're teaching Joey, certainly your intention wasn't to kill the value of the car, but these types of things are all demands that can kill the value of items that your teaching them to ask for. So, prioritize the skills you are trying to teach and remember, if the items aren't valuable, you can't teach a mand. 

01:01:45
When teaching the first mands, avoid teaching: "yes," "no," "more," "help," "please," "give me" and "eat," or anything else that can turn into a generalized mand for many things. 

01:01:50
[sil.] 

01:01:50
CHERISH When you are teaching the first mands, we recommend that you avoid teaching "yes," " no," "more," "help," "please," "give me" and even " eat." These can become generalized commands for everything. Your child might walk up to you and mand "More!" Well, more what? It just turns into a generalized mand for everything or they might come up to you and just say, "Yes!" Well, yes what? You still don't know what it is that they want unless the item is present. They're basically just saying to you, 'I want something, figure out what it is.' The same thing can happen with eat. They walk in the kitchen they mand, "Eat!" Well, at least you know they want food, but you still don't know what kind of food. It's just too general. We recommend teaching the individual food names instead, cookie, chicken, apples and then we they mand, you'll know exactly what they want. You can also later teach these mands across other functions such as intraverbals and tacts a lot more easily. 

01:02:50
When teaching the first mands, avoid teaching mands for the removal of something aversive. 

01:02:55
[sil.] 

01:02:55
CHERISH In the beginning you also want to avoid teaching mands for "break," "all done," "move," " ba-bye," "leave," etc. In order to prompt a mand, the motivation has to be present. When we are teaching our early learners, we don't want to contrive motivation for them to want us to leave them alone. We want them to want us to be near them and to give them things. If they're motivated for us to leave them alone, give them a break, or go away we won't be as successful in teaching them to ask for things. Also talking under the control of that function doesn't lead to conversation. We want our children to learn that when they talk, good things happen and they get things. We don't want them to only learn that when they talk, bad things go away. 

01:03:40
When teaching the first mands, avoid teaching "toilet." 

01:03:45
[sil.] 

01:03:45
CHERISH You also want to avoid teaching "potty" or "toilet" as a first demand. Remember, in order to prompt that mand, the child has to be motivated. We find that even typically developing kids don't always want to go potty, even when they need to. 

01:04:05
If necessary, keep number of mand targets low to maintain motivation. 

01:04:10
[sil.] 

01:04:10
CHERISH As you know, when we teach the first mands we choose those things that our child cares the most about. These are the items that you would consider to be their favorite things. The number of targets you choose depends on their ability to imitate you, either vocally or with sign. For those children with excellent vocalizations and signers with super motor imitation you can usually start teaching mands for all things the child likes as long as you don't kill the motivation. For those children who have fragile motivation, we might limit the number of items we're teaching as mands to help keep us from killing their motivation. So it's possible that less than 10 items will be targeted at a time, regardless of the child's vocal or motor imitation ability in order that the motivation be maintained. When any of those specific targets are mastered, we just add new targets right away. This might ensure that the child continues to progress. 

01:05:05
Consistency across therapists is important. 

01:05:05
CHERISH After you've determine which targets your teaching, next you want to make sure all therapists and teachers are consistent in their teaching methods. Sometimes you'll have within a program some really ambitious people who want to move on to another procedure. For example, you might be working on echo manding only and that's what the team is supposed to be doing, but you might have one therapist who starts using the echoic to mand or mimetic to mand transfer or another that might think they're ready to fade to the motivation. You cannot have people just arbitrarily making decisions. Everyone needs to be consistent. Another important note to make right here is to make sure everyone is calling things by the same name. We had a situation like this happen at a consult. I went into a home for the first time. I taught them all how to run the manding sessions. During this consult, the child learned to ask for at least 10 things, just in the time I was there. When I came back three months later and asked them what he could ask for, he could still only ask for 10 things. Guess what? They were the same 10 things we taught him the last time I was there. Of course, the first thing I thought was they must not be teaching correctly or else he would have learned more mands. So I asked everyone to spend some time teaching him mands so I could observe their procedures. Well, everyone did a really good job with the procedures. Based just on that, he should have been learning mands. So I was really baffled. So I pulled down a pirate ship that this child liked to play with and that they had all been working on manding with. In a last attempt to figure out this problem, I asked the team, 'What are you calling this toy?' And one therapist said 'pirate ship', another one said 'boat' and the third one said 'ship'. Then I held up the sword and I asked again, 'What are you calling this?' I heard knife and I heard sword. Then I held up that barrel that you find on the pirate ships and I asked them, 'Well, what are you calling this?' I heard ' barrel', 'beer barrel' and 'beer' because that third girl thought beer was easier to say than barrel. Now I did this with toy after toy and found that they were all calling things by different names. One therapist was consistently teaching two word mands. Another therapist was making up names that she thought were easier for the child to say and the third therapist was always teaching one word that was the actual name of the item. This child did not learn anything, as a result. When we fixed this problem, he started to learn. It just goes to show how subtle the problem can be that will prevent mands from being acquired. 

01:07:40
Use a variety of activities for each target mand. 

01:07:45
[sil.] 

01:07:45
CHERISH Try to use a variety of activities that involve your target mand. For example, if your child is learning to mand ball, to put it down a ball ramp, try to think of other activities you can do with a ball so you're not always just bringing out that ball ramp. You might have an activity where you roll the ball, you might have a big ball that they can bounce on, or you could get a bat and have them hit the ball if they enjoy it. Maybe this is a child that likes to knock things down. If that's the case, I could stack some blocks and have them kick a ball to knock those down. Now we have four activities with a command for ball. Hey, maybe this child likes water. You could have them throw the ball into water to see it splash. That makes five activities. Now you get an idea how you're actually gonna be able to get those hundreds of mands each day that we recommend. You have to get creative and it does take planning time but this is what we want to do. 

01:08:40
Track the mand activities used to prevent satiation. 

01:08:45
[sil.] 

01:08:45
CHERISH When you're teaching your target mands across a variety of activities, it's often necessary to create a date last played with data sheet so that you can keep track of what your child has played with already that week. Tracking what they've played with already should allow you to know how to continually rotate through those activities that the child hasn't seen for a while. This helps to prevent satiation because you can control how frequently the child gets each activity. For example, sometimes we set up a child's program so that each activity can only be done once maybe every three days. So if you play with those balls going down that ramp on Monday, you wouldn't be allowed to do that variation of the activity again until at least Thursday. This helps to keep the motivation high for the different activities. 

01:09:30
Plan ahead. 

01:09:35
[sil.] 

01:09:35
CHERISH Preventing satiation of an activity isn't the only thing you can do to help keep that motivation high. Planning ahead within your session is also very important. It's common that a therapist would be teaching in the natural environment and would run a full naming session for just one activity, such as the balls going down the ramp. When the child shows that they are no longer interested in playing with that activity, sometimes the therapist will be uncertain of what to do next. And will take that time to go and get a new activity. In the time that's lapsed between the end of that ball ramp activity and the beginning of the next one, the child is often off stiming or doing something else. If time lapses like, this you lose momentum in your session. Use the momentum you had in the first activity to your advantage. Think of at least two or three activities to play with before you start so that at the point where the child is starting to get satiated on the first activity you can immediately bring out the next one. See if you can morph from one activity straight into the next. If you can, you will maintain momentum and keep the motivations strong and you'll likely to get more teaching opportunities as a result. When we we're thinking of all the activities we'll play with during a session it's often helpful to create a lesson plan. Each lesson plan can consist of several different activities and can list all the possible mands that you might try to get when conducting each activity. 

01:10:55
Restrict free access to reinforcers when the children are not being taught. 

01:11:00
[sil.] 

01:11:00
CHERISH You can have the best activities and lesson plans in the world and if you can't prevent your child from getting free access to reinforcers when not being taught, it can still be very difficult to keep the motivation strong enough to teach those mands. Think about it. If you allow free access to the reinforcers when they're not in a session, why would they work for them during a session. For example, if someone just gave you money all the time, would you really work hard for it? No. Not unless you enjoyed the work. Now we do understand that parents need to be able to give their children some reinforcers like movies or other things during non-therapy time, just to be able to get some things done around the house. For this, what we recommend is that you still restrict the best reinforcers for therapy and just allow the less preferred ones for free time. Sometimes we'll even recommend that the therapist actually take the best reinforcers with them when they leave. This may be necessary, for example, if you have a child who is amazing at finding anything you've hidden, including the key to the door that leads to those restricted toys. Another benefit to this, besides preventing the child from getting constant access, is that the child is really happy when that therapist comes back.
