The CPCAB model of helping work and counselling practice 

00:00:20
Structure of the model 

00:00:20
UNKNOWN The CPCAB model has three parts. Each part is generic, which means that it applies to all counselling approaches. One, seven processes of supporting therapeutic change. These are applied to, two, three levels of client change. A framework of levels of client need and counselor proficiency. It can be divided into three, three dimensions of change. A framework of "treatment" factors. 

00:01:00
How person-Centred theory relates to the CPCAB model 

00:01:05
UNKNOWN I guess something quite important here umm… is perhaps how in person-centred model fits in with the CPCAB modular training. 

00:01:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, training and well, counselling practice on training. Umm… well, in our discussion about person-centred approach I was noticing some of the ways it does fit and the most obvious is that it's very much about change. Thus the focus of the model… of the CPCAB model. But also perhaps most importantly is very much about the client. The client is at the center of the CPCAB model just as in Rotarian and the mergers can, ah… person-centred apporach. And that fits not only with the person-centred approach but also with contemporary research that we talked about. So, you talked about the therapeutic environment and we agree that a person centered approach is very much about supporting the client and that's also true of the CPCAB model which is very much about seven processes of supporting change with the client at the center of this process of the center of the counseling. And within that there is obviously the relationship, working with the relationship. And there's also the umm… the counsellor and the self-awareness. And the client in the seven processes is given two. One is the kinds of… aspects of the client that you can see and observe the difference and diversity and so one of those processes working with difference and diversity. But right at the center of the seven processes of its fourth one, it's the what you can't see it's, it's, it's what you need to find out or infer through the empathic process, through coming alongside as this person. Umm… but also it's upon focusing on the client and their agenda not the agenda of some expert. 

00:03:30
UNKNOWN So right at the center of the progress of the seven of processes, process four is very much about working with the client rather than doing something to the client. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN Working with the client and supporting the client in their change, in their growth and that's as I said it's not just fitting really well with the… with the persons and rate but it's also fitting with the research and we pointed to those we talked about the client factors and what those are and that's why we've given them two in the CPCAB model to process two of the seven belong to the client. But we've also got the relationship factors in there which is the second and we've also got the counselor umm… factors which is the fifth, the self awareness, the hope of the, the hope in the counselor. Four, the client that belief in the counselor. 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN But it's also in that fifth factor is something about the counselor, you know, we who they are as well… 

00:04:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:04:40
UNKNOWN So in order that they can meet the client… 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN in their own world. 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, there's those are very much about self-awareness… 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:04:45
UNKNOWN These factors are big, you know, they're big categories. There's a lot in the relationship. There's a lot in terms of the client factors, there's a lot in those their perspectives. And the six of those seven processors are the skills, the theories that the counselor brings. In the world of research it's called the treatment. Now in the word of person centered, we don't use the words. So, it's about in the person-centered, it's about the person centered there, it's about all that the council needs to learn about that theory and it's practice. 

00:05:35
UNKNOWN But that's also quite important isn't it? Because I think also… in that within that theory it's also ideas about mental health and it doesn't really matter where you want to come from, you know, if you want to take the traditional medical model maybe for another approach and that's fine but actually within your within the person center approach we might be arguing against that but it's something about understanding you're in theory… 

00:06:00
UNKNOWN Yes, yes… 

00:06:00
UNKNOWN I'd like to be able to work within that model or work within that theoretical base and understand its own dynamic and how that supports client trend. 

00:06:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. So that's the first part of the CPCAB model. You know, I haven't mentioned number one and number seven, they relate obviously to every approach you need a professional frame where you need to work ethically and safely. And you also need reflective practice I think nobody's going to disagree with that in, you know, whether there's CPCAB or Psychodynamic or transpersonal whatever. Umm… that's the first part of the model and what we're saying is these seven processes they're, they're they work and they're also underpinned by the research. And then what the model does apply it the seven processes, the seven processes of supporting change, the therapeutic environment, of client. It applies it to three levels of change. Umm… first level being about the problems of living, the second is about changing the self, and the third level is, or changing aspects of the self. And the third is the foundations itself changing aspects of the foundations of self. So… 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN say bit more about what the self foundation of self… 

00:07:35
3 Service Levels 

00:07:35
Service level A A.Coping with problems of living 

00:07:35
Service level B B. Changing aspects of the self 

00:07:35
Service level C C. Changing the foundations of the self 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN Well, the idea is that umm… as, as you said in your intro. It's all about changing, what people want is to change their lives when they have problems in their lives and they want things to be different. And you can work with somebody at that left, you know, they present with a specific problem in their life and you work at that level. You work… helping them to cope better, supporting them to cope better with the problems in their life, but the model suggesting that, sometimes you need to go deeper. Not so much out there but, in here, in the self that, that in order to cope better with the problems in their life the person needs to change some aspect of himself… 

00:08:30
UNKNOWN But something has to train with in… 

00:08:35
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:08:35
UNKNOWN for true trend. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN Well, I'm not so bothered about whether it's true or not, it is more that umm… 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN Sustain to believe… 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN It's more that, sometimes you can just talk about a problem in one's life and kind of come up with the solution. 

00:08:55
UNKNOWN So, it depends on what level you're coming in at? 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN Well, yes… 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:09:00
UNKNOWN yeah, well, I suppose what I'm saying is that umm… sometimes that sounds enough. In other words, let's say if I had a really bad argument with your wife umm… or partner, and uh… it might be that that's a kind of isolated thing you're feeling really upset, you're talking about those upset feelings and then in the counseling or in the helping work. You can then go back and talk to your partner and that's kind of moves things on in a in a good way. Umm… and you don't need to do any more, right? That kind of particular problem… 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN …that problem which kind of, you might have quite shattered by and really upset with the talking about it with somebody and giving them the space to talk about it if they feel it was sufficient and what you might decide it was actually I wanted to do is I've looked at these feelings I need to actually talk to them, my partner about it. However, what might emerge in the counseling is actually well, this isn't just, you know, this sounds all the time and not just with my partner it happens also same kind of thing is happening over there with my umm… friend, and my colleague over there, and maybe even, you know, and it's like there is a pattern in me that I'm caring about. So I need to change that pattern I need to change something about myself in order to cope better to live better to kind of self actually I still use that approach to try to move towards self actualization to grow, I need to change something in myself so. It's not so much about real change or anything like that. It's about what's needed. And within the model the suggestion is over the proposal is that you can change yourself what aspects of the self that are at a, at a quite an explicit level. But sometimes things are quite deeply hidden, otherwise implicit. And that's more difficult to get to. We talked when we talked about person to approach, we talked about the client developing trust and not only the cancer but also in themselves and that you can't get to those hidden places. Quickly, you have to develop the trust in yourself that is all going to kind of like flow over me and wash me into some horrible drowned place, you know, which is probably… 

00:11:40
UNKNOWN It's one of the of the deep places which is beyond the neck cutter and then behind the locked door. 

00:11:45
UNKNOWN Yes, very much. So, yes, and again, you know, it's not about going there for the sake of it. It's going it's only going to go there if it turns out that's where you need to go the client, the client works out for themselves going to think actually, you know, I know there's a stuff going on them, locked away not just behind the door but kind of steal safe with sixteen locks on it. I really never ever want to look at but actually I know I'm going to have to if I'm going live on in my life. That's not something the counselor decides. 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN Yes, when the clients ready to give… 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, absolutely. 

00:12:30
UNKNOWN So, three levels and the models proposing that there's a third level which is called the foundations itself or changing aspects of the foundations of the cell. And the idea there is that there are… very fundamental ah, elements of the self that usually we understand in terms of early development, a kind of basic experiences of being in the world of others. These foundations developed when we are literally developing our understanding of the world as… 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN Absolutely. 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN …as children but understanding not in a head sense but in a kind of co-person sense, we are understanding it emotionally, when understanding it in terms of bodily experience where… so there are, there are those that level of the self which is obviously very deep and very fundamental. And which for some people, some people may need to go there. Umm… and perhaps some of the umm… severe complex mental health problems can be explained by that level of umm… 

00:13:50
UNKNOWN Fragility. 

00:13:55
UNKNOWN Fragility and difficulty and again for some people it maybe umm… helpful to work on this foundations umm… 

00:14:10
UNKNOWN Umm… which leads to more complex mental health issue. 

00:14:10
UNKNOWN Yes, so there is… if those foundations were problematic you know if one grew up in thing you used the metaphor from, you know, being thrown into the cellar and having not having those conditions of those conditions when they're very much to grow and to learn about the world in a, in a positive way then that's going to leave you with a lot of difficulties perhaps. Umm… but in terms of model then how would we or how do you see uh… it relating to the person-centered approach. 

00:14:55
UNKNOWN I guess from a person-centered perspective, I guess through you can quite successfully work with in the whole spectrum of, of the surface levels. Umm… and I guess what… would be you to sometimes of person-centered is working where the client is. Umm… and I sort of, for some reason I'm thinking of umm… promptly on the work he does with umm, clients who are able to articulate where they are. Umm… and… he would try and listen and reflect back sometimes the noises, the gestures of the client is making umm… say for example, if the client is just moving their leg, you might tap the foot in a certain way and the research that he has done and umm… the work has been done with calories who work with people with severe disabilities is that for the first time something starts to change. That they start to respond differently that's always that they wake up because they're being heard in their own terms and I think how this relates… 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN Wait, wait, you kind of relating that to the very much his foundation. 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN Yeah and I think how that relates is if I can contact the client in their terms, in their reality, in their world certainly more complex levels umm… what's maybe service level see. Umm… something can start to change umm… but also I think it's important to recognize that as some thing about where the client is also ready to go or prepare to go if we pushing a client into you said about the locked box with sixteen locks, you know, it is only shrove the client in that is not going to be helpful for the client. 

00:17:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:17:10
UNKNOWN But, you know, as we work with each of these sixteen locks we might eventually unlock it, if that's where we need to go… 

00:17:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:17:20
UNKNOWN or if the client feels they need to go that the client may not need to go there, and told for that to be trained. 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN So it's recognizing that it's the client that takes the lead as well, a lot about who's taking the lead, it's who's journeying in the along so lead. 

00:17:35
UNKNOWN Yes. So that's the model there is a framework for thinking about different levels of client need. But in person-centered particularly, it's very much about the client, following the client, not leading the client. 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN Following the client, I don't think that means letting the client off. 

00:17:55
UNKNOWN No, no, no, no… 

00:17:55
UNKNOWN I think that also means looking up where the block is to going to somewhere because something that's where the work has to be… 

00:18:00
UNKNOWN But even if… 

00:18:05
UNKNOWN before we go deeper or if we don't go deeper. But even the recognition of actually that is such an awful place I never want to go there, we can look at what that feels like to be that is an awful place and I'm not going there and somehow that brings about that insight bring articulation of the insight and someone else recognizing it and supporting it produce about some sort of in certain trained. 

00:18:30
UNKNOWN And the other aspect of that element and model that part of the model is it's about an associated level of counselor proficiency. So, what it's saying is that, you can do a certain amount of training and work informally at that first level of umm, working with life problems with more training you can work at that level in a deeper way formally but, to work at these other levels working with the self that there's an associate level of proficiency. 

00:19:10
UNKNOWN And I think, you know, when someone completes their initial training, then there's still that foundation. You know, the cement standards it's not quite that far but it's only with experience and further training that you've told that competency to be able to work with more complex clients. 

00:19:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's also about knowing your limits. And it's about knowing, it is about… if you don't know how to work with helping someone to change themselves. Don't go there, refer them on. Similarly, if you don't know about working on the foundations of the self, you don't know about working with complex mental problems… 

00:19:50
UNKNOWN Refer. 

00:19:50
UNKNOWN refer them on. And… 

00:19:50
UNKNOWN Being honest can grow up with your self, if you think. 

00:19:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, so there's a model that has a number that's part of what has a number of elements to it and it's both, it's saying something about client need and the level of change, associate level of change and it's also saying something about cancer proficiency and the limits of that proficiency. 

00:20:15
UNKNOWN But I think it's also recognizing that as a person-centered therapist you can work all these levels umm… with experience… 

00:20:25
UNKNOWN With the, with the knowledge, skills and experience. 

00:20:30
UNKNOWN Absolutely. 

00:20:35
Three dimensions of change: the third part of the CPCAB model 

00:20:40
UNKNOWN So that's the first two parts of the model. And we've looked at how the seven processes fit really well and that actually they fit the three levels fit quite well too. And the third part is a way of it's a generic way or a way of thinking about the very many different approaches, and the very many theories and skills and treatments to use have it. And it's providing a kind of common framework for that. And what, what its saying is that there are three dimensions of change. Umm… three dimensions of change both in terms of problems of living which is three dimensions of the person in their relationships at a particular life stage, and exploring those three elements or those three dimensions sorry, is can be valuable. And similarly, the counselor drawing and understanding of persons and relationships. And life and the life course can be of value in working with these problems of living is like three dimensions to the problems of living. But when it comes to working with the self. It's three ways of working with the self is an internal dimension and we have actually looked a part. When we talked about the conflict between the mask and another kind of in a hidden part, that's, that's talking about this internal dimension and we can change what the model says, what the CPCAB model prepares us is we can change that relationship, the internal relationship. So it doesn't have to be, you know, a conflict. It can be you can, you can get to the point where you feel you are self inside and you take on the mask and you put it on. And it's not some hugely different part it's something that you do for the benefit of somebody else say, if you're in… 

00:22:50
UNKNOWN Obviously, when mask becoming more transparent. 

00:22:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:22:55
UNKNOWN So, actually you see more of the real you where have the mask being really solid and… 

00:23:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:23:00
UNKNOWN …it is like… 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN So, we certainly, we've certainly seen how that relates to President in CPCAB would be about, you know, not a CPCAB, is about changing the way we relate within ourselves whether it's, you know, forced stopping or whatever it's, changing the way that… we handle our feelings inside. And, and in… I mean the traditional, Psychodynamic model is, is the umm… is eager and super eager that's a model of the internal shape of the self and the conflict between… 

00:23:35
UNKNOWN And the conflicts… 

00:23:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. So that's the first dose dimensions the internal dimension. The second is the relational dimension and we've talked about that as well in person centered how you may carry a person within yourself of relating with other people which if changed can lead to better relationships. 

00:24:00
UNKNOWN At in a sense the therapeutic relationship umm… is a model of a good relationship like… 

00:24:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:24:10
UNKNOWN We transposed outside if you like the therapy with… 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, there is, especially if the relationship doesn't involve difficulties which are then worked on and it becomes an experience or beginnings, middles and ending… 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN which can, you know, be faced not avoided. And the client can take away a lot from that experience of a well handled relationship which does involve difficult is a complex in the middle and does involve the difficult ending because, you know, I am sad that we are ending as a client and I'm sad as that as the councilor. So that's the second of these dimensions and the third is the developmental dimension. And what it's so proposing with CPCAB model is that we just as we, we can't, we can't really change who we are but we can change that we relate the way that we relate within ourselves. We can't change other people but, we can change the way we relate with other people. 

00:25:10
UNKNOWN Or how we respond. 

00:25:10
UNKNOWN Yes, very much so in a way moving from reaction to responding. With the third dimension, we can't change the past but we can change the way we relate with our past with our personal history. So the stories that we tell about ourselves, you know, this is what happened there and I ended up with this and therefore I shall never love again. For example, we can change that, we can change it by going back and taking a look at it and umm… re-experiencing some of the feelings that we felt that overwhelmed us and whatever. So the development or third dimension is relation to the self is working with us versus of is about changing the way we relate with our past, the way we relate with our personal history. 

00:26:05
UNKNOWN And I think that's quite important because a lot of people would assume, you know, person centered it works and here and now, but actually within person-centered, we, we do work with the process if the client brings the positive into therapy and often it's about coming to terms perhaps with something that helps him moving forward from something rather remaining stuck in, whatever the particular situation. 

00:26:30
UNKNOWN Yes. Again it's not… and the person centered is not about pushing here. It's about going on… 

00:26:35
UNKNOWN Or, not assuming little streaming that we have to get into the path. 

00:26:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, yes. But if the client brings that then person centered can the person centered approach… 

00:26:45
UNKNOWN With what… 

00:26:50
UNKNOWN Person centered therapist, a counselor, will work with that and help the client change the way they relate with that past. So, thank you. 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN Thank you.
