MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Hi, my name is Matt Englar-Carlson and I am the host of this video series on the skills of counseling. This program is on Treatment Adherence and Relapse Prevention. I like to welcome our featured expert, Dr. Miguel Gallardo. Welcome 

00:00:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Thank you. I appreciate it. 

00:00:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Can we talk about your approach to counseling? 

00:00:45
Miguel E. Gallardo, PsyD 

00:00:45
Department of Psychology, Pepperdine University 

00:00:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Sure. Sure. Yeah. You know, umm… Let me put into context who I work with. So I, I work with uh… a lot of underserved, in many ways un-served communities uh, in, in, in the context where I do therapy. So I work with a lot of, a lot of Latino communities, a lot of uh… immigrant communities. 

00:01:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:01:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO But a lot of them are part primarily uh… monolingual Spanish speaking. 

00:01:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

00:01:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO So I… You know, one of the, one of the things that happens just in society in general is there's, there's a lot of dehumanizing that happens I think to a lot of, a lot of folks, for the folks that I'm working with often times. And so I've, I've learned over the years that, that one of the most foundational uh…, you know, foundations that I have for therapy is, is humanizing the people that I'm working with. And so, so I feel like, you know, one of my primary foundations is, is really humanistic in, in my approach, person centered, person oriented. I pull from other, you know, I think Adlerian theory and therapy also really guides a lot of the work that I do around, you know, the, the humanistic aspect, the, the goal oriented aspect. Umm… And I also use uh… some solution focused principles as well. Uh… I like, I like to focus on what's working for people, what their strengths are, what already exist in resources they have available to them. Which I think is a little bit of a shift from our, maybe our traditional way of thinking about understanding people and then thinking about what's wrong with people. I want to know what's right with people. And, and how I can build from that and help them uh… create better outcomes for themselves along the way. And I find, that's been very helpful particularly with the folks that I work with oftentimes. Uh… Who, uh… who are in really desperate situations and, and really need to kind of figure out what to do to get life on a different track in many ways. 

00:02:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. It sounds like your approach is really kind of guided by the populations that you work with and that, you know, these might be marginalized populations that in some ways need a boost and need someone to kind of point out strengths and resources. 

00:02:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. I mean, I, I have a real strong cultural foundation. And I believe everyone has culture. So even though I, I work with a lot of under-served communities, the foundations that I use therapeutically, I use with whomever may come and see me. So I have folks who are uh…, you know, umm… well educated on the upper echelon of society and folks who are, you know, have really no education and, and are trying to just figure out how to negotiate society. And so I have, I have a gamut. Primarily I'm working with the folks who are on the, maybe what, what, what, what we might call the lower socioeconomic uh… statuses of society in some ways. But, you know, I really… My approach… I really feel like that humanistic approach is so critical. I particularly worry about that, that today more than ever. As if like we're, we rely so much on uh… on trying to implement interventions in a particular way and, and using a particular intervention in certain ways or… And I, I worry that we're, we're losing at times that humanistic aspect that I think is so foundational to, to successful outcomes therapeutically. And that has served me very well with the people that I work with. 

00:03:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, that core of yours comes through that you really want to kind of see the person who's across you and that you're working with. 

00:04:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah, I want to humanize. I want to humanize who they are and, and see them for what they already have available to them and their strengths. I always tell my students, no matter where if someone comes from, you should always be able to identify the strengths that they have available to them. It doesn't matter who they are, person off the street or whoever it may be. And so I think if we, if we fail to do that, then we're also uh… doing a disservice to those who are working with. 

00:04:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds, it sounds like theoretically you're, you're kind of eclectic or integrative? 

00:04:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Integrative. That's it. I'm integrative. 

00:04:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. And that you… When you use interventions, you kind of (inaudible ) different interventions, but you actually Adlerian, kind of humanistic aspects of, aspects of solution focus therapy. 

00:04:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Solution focus yeah. I like, I like a version of the miracle question. I think it's helpful to, to get people. I think when people get into a rut, they, they tend to focus primarily on what's wrong and what's not right. 

00:04:50
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. 

00:04:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO And so I feel like, you know, with some of the interventions I use uh… help them start trying to think about what, what it could be and what, what it could look like for them. And also trying to pull from uh… areas of their life, where maybe it wasn't always this way and, and what they are trying to work towards may have already existed in some way or another. And how can we recreate some of those outcomes going forward in a sense? 

00:05:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So miracle question is… Imagine that… 

00:05:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO I use… I use… 

00:05:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Everyone has different versions of it sometimes… Yeah. Yeah. 

00:05:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO You know, the miracle question. The way that it, it has, it has been written about and, and it says it's… It, it doesn't feel as natural to me, to ask in that way. So I've tailored a little bit to, to really, you know, if I, I ask different variations of it. But also one variation might be if life was ideal for you. Like, if we had uh… maybe like four or five sessions together or at the end of our four or five sessions together umm… you felt entirely different, you felt better. Life was where you wanted to be at that moment in time. You know what would have had to have happened? And so, so it's not to like hey, life changed overnight question, but it, it's really around like getting people to think about. You know, what, what do I need? What might be helpful for me? And number one, what am I working towards? And then, and then what might be helpful for me to get to that space? And sometimes people don't always know how to answer the question right away, that's why they are there. But even just planting that seed I think is very helpful for people uh… to begin to shift how they are thinking about the process a little bit. 

00:06:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And even as you ask that question, I can see that humanistic element, that comes through in that, that you really want to kind of connect with people about that with where they and helping them kind of an invasion of possibility or, or, or potential, that could be different. 

00:06:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right. That's right. Yeah. And… My, my approach is very collaborative. I mean, it's very umm… I try to reduce as much as, as much as possible. Those power differentials that we talk about in therapy and whatnot. And I try to really, really meet people where they are at and, and work collaboratively in the process. I think that's important. It's important to empower people. 

00:07:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So like I'm, I'm wondering how you came to be a professional counselor, like, what's, what's your background in terms of how you got to a place where you are now? 

00:07:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah, I know. It's, it's… I mean, yeah, it's a good question. I, I had no idea where, where, where I… What I wanted to do early on in my life. I just knew that there were a lot of things happening around me that didn't seem right to me. So, you know, I, I, I, you know, I think there's been umm… many times in my life where by I've experienced a lot of injustice. You know, both either to family, either to myself at times, either to other communities at times. And, and I always felt there was something that was, that, that didn't seem right about that. I felt like, you know, people just don't understand people. We don't understand each other in essence. And I think that was really the, the driving force for me to think about getting into um… into, into psychology. I had no idea what a psychologist was actually at some point in time. I thought you had to go to psychiatry to, to do. And then I realised psychiatry wasn't the work that I wanted to do. And then… umm… As soon as I began to, to think about, you know, uh… serving people in that way and giving voice to people in that way. It resonated with me. It resonated me. You know, I, I come from a very collectivistic relational family. And so I feel like, you know, my, my family in essence and parents gave me a lot of the foundational tenants that I continue to rely on in therapy which were compassion, empathy, love for people, caring for people. I always tell umm… You know, I always want my students to know that they should always see themselves and other people, no matter who they are working with as a way to see our connectedness to each other. Uh… And I think those are really uh…, you know, I learned those growing up and and… And when I went to graduate school, I had… I entered graduate school with, with some of those foundations in someway. I think they continued to develop over time. Umm… And, and graduate school taught me about, you know, theories and interventions and whatnot, but I had to figure out how to make it work… 

00:09:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON For you. 

00:09:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO For me. For me and not, and not try to emulate it in some way that wasn't consistent with me and to remember the human aspect, that I'm, I'm a human being first and foremost and that, that's okay when I'm trying to do all these different interventions and theories and whatever else it may be. So I think, I think it was around injustice and umm… You know, having been on the, the receiving end of umm… uh… oppressive situations or, or, or comments or things of that nature. And this thing you know, I wanted to help people understand ourselves better and to see our connectedness to each other. And I still do that work today. That's a lot of the work I still do. It's, how can I help people understand ourselves better in our connectedness to each other? It's our future is relying upon it. 

00:09:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's, it's very Adlerian in what you're saying in terms of social interests and how do we make, how do we improve the social welfare around us. That right. 

00:10:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right. That's right. Absolutely. Yeah, I mean… Yeah, go ahead. 

00:10:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Oh, I can hear that roots in you too, like the roots of your family and conducting your foundation and then as you began to add some expertise and kind of ways to kind of put those roots to use. 

00:10:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO And I, and I really, I mean, you know, the, the skills that I have developed therapeutically came from working with people. It really did. I mean, I think, you know, graduate school gave me a foundation. Uh… But I learned what to do with folks by working with folks. 

00:10:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON With people. 

00:10:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO With people. And, and particularly those in most need in society. Uh… And so I, I think it was… You know, that, that's… Those are like the… That's where the real education began for me in many ways. And, and it's true that work in those uh… experience that I really um… developed in some ways. What I thought were really foundational tenets for me to implement therapeutically and what was working with people. 

00:10:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. Yeah. So, Miguel, if, if your counseling is effecting, what do you want to see happen? 

00:11:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Uh… changed number one. 

00:11:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:11:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Right? Hopefully, hopefully people are, are, are getting to a better space. Umm… But, but, but more importantly some self-awareness. And I think the best therapy is uh… self-awareness and, and people knowing uh… how they can understand themselves better and help themselves better. I, I don't, I don't want people to rely on me for uh… forever. That, that, that, that I think perpetuates the status quo in some ways, this dependency on. And I don't… That's just not ever been a goal of mine. I'm not trying to rush people out necessarily, but I also don't necessarily want to foster dependence on me as therapist. So I, I hope that they develop some level of self-awareness and insight. And I'm not talking about insight as it relates like, what happened 30 years ago or when they are children. 

00:11:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. But the classic understanding, yeah. 

00:11:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO But the classic understanding. I think that, that can certainly… That's certainly has it's place in therapy and I think that can be helpful at times. But I, but I really… On some level that kind of insight for some of the folks that I work with, it's like a privilege to be able to sit there and reflect on that. What happened when I was five years old? What happened when I was four years old, you know, or ten years? That's just a luxury and a privilege in some ways. And so it, it doesn't mean it's not relevant or not important. But for some folks that, that just isn't necessarily what's going to be the most advantageous. I think there's a, there's an assumption that, that kind of insight is necessary for some meaningful change to occur therapeutically. And that hasn't been my experience in the work that I do. I think I've, I've certainly done that with folks and that has been helpful. But also just people understanding how the environments in which they find themselves have a lot to do with some of the ways in which they see themselves and some of the ways in which they are either negotiating or, or are not necessarily understanding how to negotiate their lives a little bit better. So I, I really think about it from a relational systemic perspective in many ways that, you know, our, our, our, our environments have a lot to do with. In some ways, how we come to understand ourselves, how we make sense of ourselves and, and how we then negotiating the, the context in which we find ourselves. So that kind of insight… That's really somewhat of a libratory psychology theory… It's like helping people understand and free themselves up a little bit from, from some of the limited ways in which they may understand who they are. And really tapping into the strengths and resources that they, that they have, that they are probably not necessarily accessing at the moment in time. 

00:13:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It sounds like there's an awareness of the bigger picture in a way of kind of social political reality and context and then with that coming tools to navigate, empowerment and figure out how to, how to create the change. 

00:13:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, people don't come into the rooms and sense their environment. It, it, It's, impossible. It's possible. So… Yeah. 

00:14:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So you're also a counsel educator? And you, and you, and you teach and you train. And so I'm wondering when you in that role, what are the most important areas that you want your students to learn or, or develop? 

00:14:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. You know, one… I'd say that the two most, the two that stand out. There are several of the… I'll start with these two. The first one is, understanding their own stimulus value. So in other words… Do they know how they might come across to other people? Because if, if, if they, if they have an awareness of how they might be coming across to other people, that in some ways might give them some information about what people may choose to say to them, not say to them, connect with them, not connect with them. So those are variables that I think are critical for students to really understand. Like, what is, what is their stimulus value? And, you know, how, how, how do you think you come across to other people? And based on how you come across to other people, how might that impact the relationship you develop with the people you're working with? What they tell you, what they don't tell you, etcetera. And so I think, I think understanding their own stimulus value is, is foundational. 

00:15:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It almost sounds like it's, it's self awareness with an interpersonal twist. 

00:15:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely. The other thing I think is important is, I, I, I always worry when we try to train um… students and, and in a way that, that separates out who they are as human beings and people from the work that they are doing professionally. And so, so I really, I really want students to see that, that they are people and human beings first and foremost. And that, that's okay for that process to also be a part of their therapeutic process. This whole idea of being objective and value free… I have never believed that. And everything we do is value laden and, and… You know, I can, I can try to be as objective as possible, but how even just show up, people who are going to start forming, formulating ideas and assumptions about maybe who I am and what I represent. So I really want there… I don't want there to be a separation from who we are as people, from who we are as professionals. I think that… I think that synthesis and that integration is critical to serving people. And again you, you have to think about my context and my foundation. I'm working with people. 

00:16:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Yeah. 

00:16:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Who are, who are, you know, oftentimes highly disenfranchised and oppressed in many ways and so… So, so I have come to learn in many ways that trying to negotiate in separate out… It, it's, it's ineffective. It's ineffective in many ways. And so, so I really want them to, to know that it's okay to be a citizen of the, of the world and, and that be a part of who you are as a ther…, as a counselor, as a counselor. Umm… I also think there are awareness of, of their own power and privilege. It's critical. So, so being aware of, you know, assumptions biases. But the power and privilege that they also… Even students who come from historically disenfranchise communities, if they are, if, if, if they have found themselves in an education program, a graduate education program, there's some level of privileges at that point, at that point of time. 

00:17:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And responsibility that comes with that. 

00:17:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO And responsibility that comes with that in essence. And so I want them to know what their own power and privilege is, regardless of what their background is and who they, and what they represent. Umm… I think those are, those are critical elements to that. 

00:17:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, it really seems like, at this emphasis on how you transform the person, transform the student and in doing so, then you can always learn the technical skills later. But, but it's… again that humanistic, that human… Yeah. 

00:17:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO I always tell, I always tell my students. I care more about who they are as people and human beings than any grade that they ever get in, in a class or in the program. As I focus on processes, not outcomes. If you focus on the process of how we, how you're doing things, outcomes will follow at the end of the day. 

00:17:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

00:17:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. 

00:17:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So counseling you see it as a process and in this program we're looking at, at the fifth or final stage which is, which is kind of, kind of learning treatment adherence and if any relapse and evaluating counseling. So there's lot in there. What exactly do you consider adherence and elevation of counseling? 

00:18:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. Well, I think there are important tenets and, and really important foundations therapeutically. You know, a treatment adherence to me… Number one, I feel like, when I work with folks who needs to be a, a match between how we understand what's, what the issue might be or what the challenge might be and then also there's a match between how we're trying to address it in many ways.Okay. Okay. 

00:18:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO And it's like… If, if there's a good match there in some ways then hopefully people are showing up. I think that's one way of, of, of understanding, you know, whether or not people are adherative. There's, number one, they are showing up. 

00:18:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Like in some ways that's the core, right? 

00:18:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. 

00:18:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON If they are not showing up, not adherence. 

00:18:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO But they, they are coming. Although what I also tell uh… tell folks is that, you know, just because someone is in your office, doesn't mean they are always ready to be there. 

00:18:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That's true. 

00:18:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Doesn't always been there. So, so, so, so sometimes showing up can be uh… I think one way to assess that. But I think more importantly it's around… Is what we're doing are, are, are the… The, the clients that we're working with, are they implementing what we're doing out in their own lives and trying to create some different outcome or change for themselves. Um… So, so if, if, if people are following through I think with the things that we're talking about doing in therapy, then to me that's also another form of, of treatment adherence in any, in many ways. I also go back to this idea of… Do they have? Are they understanding their, what they are experiencing in a different way. I think that's also really important to, to assess. You know, is, is, is this making… Is this helping you understand, you know, what you experience in a different way and, and are you able to, to take what we're doing and is it, is it, can you implement it in some meaningful way? And I think, I think those help me understand if what we're doing is making sense for people. You know, if people come and, and they are no showing or canceling or they are not necessarily following through with some of things really, but then I always re-visit. Okay. That's part of the evaluation process. As like, I need to revisit constantly. You know, uh… number one, the treatment here and piece and the evaluation piece happen throughout the process. It's an ongoing process that I think is, is critical. It's not, it's not a just a one time or two time deal per se. I think it happens along the way. Umm… But if someone is, you know, maybe telling me I can't do this or this isn't working, then I need to check in and say, "Is it something that we're doing that maybe isn't, isn't necessarily making sense. Are you having a difficult time for some other reason that may, that I, that we may have to think about, you know, addressing differently in some ways or another. And so, so I do think… The one thing I always tell students umm… And it's something that I always do in my own work is, you know, you should, I was so much, you should always know why you're doing what you're doing, even if it's just relationship building. Like, why is… What, what makes that important for you? What, what makes that meaningful towards uh… the work that you're trying to do with your, with your clients? And so I think if we can understand why we're doing what we're doing, then that helps us to continue to understand and evaluate if it's working or not and check in with clients and, and trying to see if, if, if, if it's making sense. I think there needs to be congruence between what we're doing, what we're talking about, and then what's happening outside the therapy room. So I want them to develop some awareness as well as clients. 

00:21:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON As you say that I'm (inaudible), so there's, there's treatment adherence, there is, is evaluation, that's a constant. You're constantly kind of making sure that what you're doing is kind of affective, it's aligning with the client goals and you're also begin to see that, that it's being carried out of, of the session into the real world, into their lives. So a constant kind of, kind of, kind of rolling with that. And then that… In the last piece we talked about was relapse prevention. So where does that fit in? 

00:22:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Well, relapse prevention I think is, you know, goes back to what I was mentioning before around. You know, I don't want people to rely on, to, to come to rely on me as, as their… 

00:22:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON As their change agent. 

00:22:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO As their change agent ultimately. And so, so I think, you know, the, the relapse prevention is critical because it's a, it's a, a preparation and planning process of therapy. We're, we're really preparing… I try to prepare the people I work with um… in ways that that, that, that the changes they are making are sustainable. And that they are, they are able to recreate them as they need to along the way. So part of the, the relapse prevention aspect of it is, planning for that. So, you know, how can I help people umm… remember and, and, and, and some ways continue to internal… Actually how can I help people internalize some of the, the successes and the strengths and the, and the, and the resources they have available to them? 

00:23:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That's self awareness. 

00:23:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's self awareness in many ways. But also understanding when something happens that is actually successful for them. Because I think sometimes when people get into a rut, even, even when something good happens, they don't may not always see it that way. So I think sometimes we have to, we have to help our, our clients see that, that, that was a different outcome than what they're used to. And maybe it's… They are not used to it or they are not sure what to make, how to make sense of it in some ways. So I feel like, you know, the, the relapse prevention piece umm… is critical because I want uh… therapy to be liberating and empowering for people and not to foster dependence. So I want them to be able to continue to do the work that we have done in the future and, and to, and to understand. The other part of… The other part of relapse which is that, two things actually. The, the first one is that, I also want people to, to understand that, you know, stumbling and falling is a normal part of just life in general. You know, just because we may have uh… gotten to a place where, you know, things are feeling better for them. That it's possible that they might find themselves in a challenging situation again um… and to really begin to separate out to a certain degree, what, what most people might respond to a challenging situation versus someone thinking that, that what they were experiencing a year or two ago is like coming back all over again and so really separating out that… There's a normal part of just, you know, stumble and falling and that's okay. And the other piece I think is critical to relapse prevention is, is skill development. So, you know, how, how can we help people develop the skills and also practice those skills. So, you know, some of the solution focus calls them experiments. CBT calls it homework assignments. And so, you just, you know, and, and, you know, adlarians very goal oriented. And so most of the work I do revolves around those tenants in many ways. And so how can we… How can I help people begin develop the skills through the experiments and homework assignments that we're doing to create some of those changes they want? So that they learn how to do those things without me being around. 

00:25:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. You know, it sounds like what I hear you say is even this aspect of relapse prevention again isn't the last session or the second last session. It's leading into building skills. So as you get towards the end, again people having the ability to take the things out. 

00:25:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right. That's right. And, and, and helping people remember what they are learning and those skills that they are developing and the skills that maybe they have already had, but they are accessing now in, in a more meaningful way for themselves, so that they can, they can keep those on there, at the forefront going forward. 

00:25:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, I was thinking that, that, you know, we're calling this the fifth stage. And, you know, sometimes in textbooks, you know, fifth stage or replase prevention is at the end of the book and you might not get to it in a 10 weeks semester or 16 we week semester and so students never read this. And people might look at relapse prevention and wonder like, you know, it's not that important. You know, and, and is it important? 

00:26:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO It is important. I think it's critical. I think it's critical because what I mentioned before. I don't want umm… I don't want to foster dependence on me. 

00:26:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, that seems like a really big piece, yeah. 

00:26:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO It's a huge piece and I think the way that we prepare, help people prepare to, to feel like they can rely on themselves is to help them prepare for what's to come beyond umm… , you know, our time together. Whatever that time may look like or however long it may be are shorter may be. And so I do think… You know, and I, and I, feel like that, that's a piece that people maybe do. They just don't think about it in that way also. But I think there has to be some intentionality about prepping and planning process, uh… so that we can really liberate people and, and empower people uh… to, to heal themselves at the end of the day. And that's the goal and I think one of the primary ways that we do that is by uh… implementing tenants and principles around relapse prevention. And what that means for them, what that can look like for them and then how to prepare them for those potential outcomes that may come their way. 

00:27:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, it strikes me as you say that. You know, we talk about kind of what you hope would happen. You know, as a change and then, and the piece here is making those changes last, those changes last over last and… 

00:27:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah, lasting, lasting changes. And that people are prepared that if thing counter something that doesn't look like what they even came into therapy for, that they feel like they have the internal fortitude, the resources, whether internal, external, to rely on and to pull from to deal with whatever situation may come their way. Even if it doesn't look exactly like what may have brought them into therapy so and so. I think that's also a critical one. And then, and I think that's where the skill development piece comes into play because the skills that, that, that I tend to work with people on are really transferable to a number of different life situations because they are really helping people figure out how to negotiate situations better and to create uh… better outcomes for themselves at the end of the day. 

00:28:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So what are keys to success at this stage? In terms of key success and might you tailor this for different types of people, uh… maybe based, based on gender or sex or based on cultural orientation or CES. Like, how, what sort of key success here? 

00:28:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO I think so… I think some keys to success are, you know, our people internalizing that those skill development. Are they internalizing their, their, their, the understanding they have about what they have experienced in a different way? I think those are, those are the key, those are successful outcomes if you will. I think, you know, in terms of… doesn't look differently potency, it can. I mean, it certainly. I think that the idea of tailoring treatment to who we're working with is critical. And so based on, you know, client personality characteristics, client presenting concerns, cultural factors and variables, the context that once they may find themselves, what's already available to them in terms of resources or not, etcetera . All those I think are, uh… are, are areas that need to be assessed and to understand, and understood in a way that, that helps me identify what will success look like for this person. You know, I don't want to have a general idea of success or a, a, a general idea of what outcomes should look like across universally because it may look very… Just like I don't want to make an assumption that someone, someone lost someone important and then they are grieving. And what, that, that… What that grieving looks like for them or what if means for them? 

00:29:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. It is a universal grief. 

00:29:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO There's not universal grief. There's no universal sadness. And there are some tenets that I think, you know, transcend but uh… but it… What does it mean to the individual? And then based on what my understanding of what it means for them. What, what are they… What do we have accessible to us that we can build from to help them uh…, you know, learn what they have experienced in a new way, develop some skills, access already existing strengths and resources to then help them, uh…, you know, prevent further uh… challenges in a away that, they brought them to therapy to begin with. 

00:30:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Now it strikes me that. You said, you, you often work with a range of clients and you might have, have someone who's quite core, you might have someone who's a C.E.O.. 

00:30:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Right. 

00:30:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, and you also mention that, you know, we need to think about self-awareness than it's tied to the context in which they live. And, you know, so it's really critical again to tie uh… that's what's available to them, what they are facing and… 

00:30:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah, context, context is critical. Context is critical. I think the context in which people come from and they find themselves, umm… , you know, really impacts the work that you do with them, what that looks like, and how you, how you match um… what we're trying to accomplish at the end of the day. 

00:30:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So how important then is it for counselors to evaluate whether or not the counseling was effective? 

00:31:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Critical. 

00:31:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Critical. 

00:31:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Critical. Critical. Yeah. It's, it's… I mentioned this earlier. I feel like… I always want my students to, to know, you know, why they are doing what they are doing. you know because if, if they don't know why they are, know what… then how they are gonna know if it was working or not or affective or not and… And, and is it matching what they know of their client? And, and, and… Are they… Is there a, is there a connection between a cognitive match and also behavioral match. So do they understand? Is there a mutual understanding about what the, what the challenges are? And are they, are they, are they working together to, to behaviorally uh…, you know, try to address those in that skill development, the phase if you will. And so I do think that uh… it is important to know if what we're doing is working or not. I feel like if we don't do that, it's a disservice to the people that we're working with at the end of the day. And I've never believed that uh… there's this open ended like process. Even, even if someone comes for a long term therapy, whatever that might mean. I feel like we need to be able to… We should be able to assess and evaluate along the way, if what we're doing is actually making any impact, positive impact or, or change for the client. Umm… so that we can then better know if we need to adjust, reassess, revisit and, and, and really think about things in a different way. 

00:32:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. You know, as you've been talking it's, it's really clear that, that this is all intertwined. 

00:32:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO It is… 

00:32:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. That it's, it's an ongoing process. Again, this isn't the last stage. It's the final stage in some ways, but it flows into all the other kind of stages of counseling. 

00:32:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right, absolutely. 

00:32:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON In just a moment we're gonna see you work in which you have six enactments with, with clients. Umm… And I'm looking forward to seeing what you do. 

00:32:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Thanks. 

00:32:45
Assessment Strategies 

00:32:50
Tailoring Treatment 

00:32:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What do you mean by Tailoring Treatment? 

00:32:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. It's just a… I'm, I'm talking about making sure that there is a mutual understanding of, of what's, what the, what the presenting concern might be between the therapist and client. I think that's foundational to… There isn't that… I don't believe in a one size fits all. I mean, I think there, there are some certainly some tenants that transcend therapy in what we do. But, but I feel like the, the… For the work to be meaningful, there needs to be a match between umm… where the clients coming from, who they are, and how I understand who they are, where they're coming from and what they are presenting with. I think if there's a, if there's that cognitive match, if there's a uh… an understanding of what the presenting issue may be uh, and, and, and, and then also how we might uh… come to agree on how to resolve the issue in some ways. That I think is, is really tailoring the treatment to the client specific needs, while also matching what's, what seems realistic and manageable and feasible based on their life context. 

00:34:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it's, it's figuring out kind of what the presenting concern is, figuring out how the client in some ways kind of, is associated with it or related to it and also connecting kind of what is possible, what you can do to help and kind of gaining some agreement on that. 

00:34:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right. That's right. I think there has to be a… I think it's a co- collaboration between the therapist and client and co-creating, you know, the, what we believe to be or are going… What, what, what we think are gonna be helpful for them at the end of the day. And, and then how we can then find ways to develop what that might look like together in collaboration. 

00:34:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON When you tailor treatment are there particular factors you're assessing? 

00:34:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. I mean, I'm looking at, at obviously the, the, you know, who the individual is, who sits before me. You know, I mean, I think that's a, that's foundational. I'm, I'm looking at which can include, you know, personality characteristics, which can include relational aspects of their lives, cultural aspects of their lives. Umm… You know, the, the, the context in which they are, they exist or the context in which they exist in, because I think that has a lot to do with, you know, what, what would make sense for us to try to accomplish outside of therapy. I need to know what that looks like as well in some ways. I think all those variables uh… really, umm… you know, come into play when I'm thinking about uh…, you know, trying to figure out what would work for somebody. And, and, you know, and I think also making sure that whatever interventions we end up deciding on umm… ,you know, are… are, are in collaboration with one another and make sense for them to implement. 

00:35:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, it seems like that joining is really important at this point. 

00:35:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO It's very important. Yeah, very important. Yeah. 

00:35:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON In just a moment we're gonna see you work with, with Tsai-Ling. I wonder if you can set up this enactment for us. 

00:35:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yes, sure. You know, it's… I think what I want people to focus on primarily in, in this particular enactment is… You know, how I go about assessing, umm… you know, her desired outcome and, and goals in therapy if you will. And then maybe even looking at, maybe what's some already existing uh… assets or resources she has. But in, but in general I want, I want, I want the viewers to understand how I go about trying to assess. Um… what are, what are, what are we trying to work towards and what is, and what is the presenting issue and umm… what could be a good goal or goals for us in therapy? 

00:36:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it sounds like the viewer should look for kind of how you begin to assess that, how you kind of work what the client is looking for. Now we're going to negotiate kind of what, what treatment might actually be? 

00:36:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right. That's right. Yeah, what it might look like for it, for us and for her. 

00:36:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. 

00:36:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Great. Hi, Tsai-Ling, how are you? 

00:36:30
TSAI-LING FRAHER I'm okay. 

00:36:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Good. You're doing okay? Yeah. 

00:36:30
TSAI-LING FRAHER Yeah. 

00:36:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO So I know that you, you, you called umm… a week or so ago and you mentioned to me that you and your husband are in the process of going through a divorce. Yeah. Can you tell me a little bit about what might be going on at this point for you? 

00:36:50
TSAI-LING FRAHER Umm… well, we… It's been about four months now. Umm… we can hear from Canada together, my husband and I and our kids. Umm… and we're just settling in, everything seems to be fine, but out of the blue he just asked for divorce. And, and, and that was that. It was nothing to talk about. There's nothing to do, nothing to understand. He just, he just left. 

00:37:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. 

00:37:15
TSAI-LING FRAHER That's been pretty hard. 

00:37:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Is that happen four months ago? 

00:37:15
TSAI-LING FRAHER Um-umm… 

00:37:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Right. Do you have kids together? 

00:37:20
TSAI-LING FRAHER We have kids together, two. 

00:37:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah, two kids. Okay. All right. And you came from Canada? 

00:37:20
TSAI-LING FRAHER Um-umm… 

00:37:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Do you have… Do you have other family here or other, other, other close relatives or someone that you also…? 

00:37:30
TSAI-LING FRAHER No, we, we came here because he wanted to pursue a career here in California. So we decided as a family we'll, we'll go. 

00:37:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

00:37:40
TSAI-LING FRAHER Umm… And I just, I just don't know what happened. 

00:37:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. All right. Umm… Let me… So, you know, typically how I, how I think about trying to uh… figure out what, uh… what might be helpful for you in some ways. I kind of want to know from you like… What… For you what, what's the most challenging or most difficult aspect for you about going through this divorce at this moment in time? 

00:38:05
TSAI-LING FRAHER I think… I think it's just the shock of it all. 

00:38:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

00:38:10
TSAI-LING FRAHER The most part is, is just… I, I don't know what happened. And two is… It's hard that when… I'm here. I thought we came here as a family, we have each other. And, and that, that's been taken away. So it's been hard to kind of go through that. Not understanding and, and go through raising children on my own essentially. 

00:38:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. And can you tell me a little bit like when you say shock, like what that actually means for you? What that might look like for you? 

00:38:45
TSAI-LING FRAHER It's like a, like a dream, like being woken up from the dream very violently. Like, all, all this time I thought we're working towards a goal together. Umm… And then one day it's, it's not, one day it's not there. Umm… Yeah. 

00:39:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO And, and just to clarify. So the, so the divorce is definitely gonna happen, that there's, there's no other alternatives at this point. You're definitely getting a divorce. 

00:39:10
TSAI-LING FRAHER Yeah, at first I wasn't sure, but… 

00:39:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

00:39:15
TSAI-LING FRAHER Yeah, I think it's… Not that I still want a marriage but I… At first I just didn't… I guess, I would, just was in denial. I didn't know what was happening. 

00:39:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

00:39:25
TSAI-LING FRAHER Umm… but now four months later, I, I know it's the right thing to do. 

00:39:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

00:39:30
TSAI-LING FRAHER Uh… But still it's hard adjusting through that. 

00:39:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. So, so what does it feel like to wake up from a, a, a dream or why saying, is it a violent dream or a, a, a nightmare of some kind. What… What does that look like? What does that… How does that feel for you? 

00:39:45
TSAI-LING FRAHER Just feel very disoriented. 

00:39:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

00:39:45
TSAI-LING FRAHER And yet I as to, I have to carry on because I have children. 

00:39:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

00:39:50
TSAI-LING FRAHER Umm… So I kind of… I feel… I feel sad, but I don't have time to stay sad. I don't have time to, to, to really work through that I guess. 

00:40:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

00:40:05
TSAI-LING FRAHER Umm… Yeah, life, life goes on especially with children. So… 

00:40:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. How are your kids doing? 

00:40:10
TSAI-LING FRAHER They are doing okay I think. They… They… They wonder what happened too. And, and I don't know about, you know, a good place to help them as well to understand. 

00:40:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So what do you think would be helpful for you given, where you are at this, at this moment? And it sounds like they are shock. There's some… There's some sadness that you're feeling. And although you not feel like you can really feel sad at this point because you have responsibilities and, and things to take care of and it just feels like it's a, a real uh… drastic change for you that, that somewhat unexpected. What do you think would be helpful for you at this, at this moment in time given where you are? 

00:40:45
TSAI-LING FRAHER I think to really understand what I'm feeling inside, what I'm going through. I think if I know… If I… If I know that clearly, then at least I have myself as an ally even if I don't have anybody else here. Umm… because I don't. I mean, it's just me and the kids. 

00:41:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. When, when you think of, of, of what kinds of things uh… would be helpful for you? Can you think of anything specifically that might be helpful, for you to think about transitioning through this process and going through a divorce? Because you mentioned you don't have, you don't have any other social support or other… 

00:41:25
TSAI-LING FRAHER Right. Right. 

00:41:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Would it be helpful for you to have a support system or more of a social network to rely on at some point or is that not important? 

00:41:35
TSAI-LING FRAHER I guess that will be nice, that will be nice. Uh… but it's just hard, I don't know anybody. I don't… Like… It's… I feel I'm not coming from a very happy healthy self. And I don't know how people will perceive me. I don't know how to make connections with people. 

00:41:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO I got you. Okay. Okay. Let me ask your question. So if, if you were, if you were going through this process in the most ideal way possible. Going through your divorce in the most ideal way from your perspective, uh… it was going as best it could be expected. Uh… You were feeling as good as you could about going through the divorce as, as you, as you possibly could be given the circumstances. What would that look like for you? What would… What would be different from what's happening now for you? 

00:42:30
TSAI-LING FRAHER Think what will really help is that I understand why is, if I can get some answers. I tried getting answers from him, but there's no answer there. Umm… And I started to realize that, I don't need answer from him, but I just need to know why. How do we get here? How… How am I here? I, I just wanna know why. 

00:42:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

00:42:50
TSAI-LING FRAHER And that's why I, I came to see you. I feel like this will help me to, to understand that better. 

00:42:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. So understand, understand how you found yourself in the situation. So it sounds like you're not necessarily… Are you, are you still waiting for your X, soon to be ex-husband to give you the, the, uh… an, an answer as to why this is happening? Are you hoping that happens or are you looking for trying to understand uh… for yourself how you may have found yourself in the situation? 

00:43:15
TSAI-LING FRAHER Umm… I think mostly just for myself now, at this point. In the beginning I wanted to know from him. I think there's a feeling of just… I just… How? Why? Why are you doing this? 

00:43:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

00:43:30
TSAI-LING FRAHER But after a while it's… 

00:43:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. And, and how would knowing the answer to that question be helpful for you? How would it… How would knowing though the answer to the why question be helpful for you? 

00:43:45
TSAI-LING FRAHER I guess so I won't know what to do next time. Or, or just, just know. they just need to know did I do something wrong? Did, did something got wrong along the process that… Yeah, it's, it's scary to have something so sudden happen. And that I've no idea how, what happened. 

00:44:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. Let me ask you another uh… an ideal question to, to just to kind of help me think about umm… Maybe what uh… life could look like for you? If, if, if you felt like at the end of… Let's say we have, you know, maybe four or five more sessions together. Uh… but at the end of those sessions together, you're in a much better place and life was good for you and you felt like you understood the why and, and, and you had a little bit more of a social support network, what would that look like? What would your life look like at that point? 

00:44:35
TSAI-LING FRAHER That sounds so good right now. I think that's where you want to get to. 

00:44:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. Do you have a sense of what life might look like if you were there? 

00:44:45
TSAI-LING FRAHER I'm starting to think. Umm… I never thought about this before. So even just thinking about it, it helps me a little bit right now. Umm… I think what would look like would be… That I don't have this nagging question on my mind of what happened, that I'll be able to move on. 

00:45:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

00:45:00
TSAI-LING FRAHER That my life is not four minus one anymore. My life is three. I don't love, that make sense. 

00:45:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So, so just not having the nagging… When was the last time you didn't feel this nagging and, and this questioning and this wonder? When was the last time you thought really good about, like life and, and, and kind of what life look like for you? Can you remember when that, that was? And what… And, and can you tell me a little bit about it? 

00:45:30
TSAI-LING FRAHER Last time. Maybe I'm being naïve. The last time I feel really good is when we started a family. 

00:45:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

00:45:35
TSAI-LING FRAHER That's what we both wanted and we had that and we're working towards a goal together. 

00:45:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

00:45:45
TSAI-LING FRAHER Yeah. 

00:45:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO So, so the last time you felt happy was when you were with your husband starting a family and working on goals together? 

00:45:50
TSAI-LING FRAHER Right. Now I'm think about it's naïve with him. It's, it's, it's not so much him been there, but just have that, of being a team, like having… You know, I think at this point it's not so much about I want back anymore. It's, it's about, we were team, like, just feeling being part of… We were a couple. We were family. We're doing something together. 

00:46:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Yeah, you know, one, one of the… One of the challenges I think in situations like this and say it makes perfect sense to me in many ways is that um… I think you're used to having been in a partnership with somebody. And, and, and in some ways beginning to rely on that partner to help kind of just move life forward in some ways and, and, and whatever way they may look like for, for a family or relationship. And so thinking about yourself separate from that uh, can be somewhat difficult and, and challenging in some ways. When, when you think about… Umm… and that's really what I want to help us work on. It sounds like you're also interested in trying to figure out, you know, how to help figure out for yourself. How you found yourself in the situation in some ways? And so I really… I want… I really want to support that, because I think it's important for, for us to begin to think about umm… what aspect of, of that partnership was really, uh… really revolved around you as an individual in essence? Because it, it, it, obviously there's two of you in that partnership in some ways. And so when… If you think about just, you weren't just relying solely on your husband or soon to be ex-husband to make life happen. 

00:47:30
TSAI-LING FRAHER No, not at all. No, not at all. 

00:47:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO You were also playing of a major part in life unfolding and, and moving forward so much. 

00:47:35
TSAI-LING FRAHER Right. If anything, I was more of a driving force. And I feel like I've always been there for him. Umm… 

00:47:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO So what makes this time different at this point? It sounds like you've been the carrying that, that, the driving force in your family? What, what, what do you think might prevent you from continuing to be a driving force in your life at this moment without your husband? 

00:48:05
TSAI-LING FRAHER Now that you asked that question, nothing really. I mean, I have always been a driving force. I have been… Not to put… Not to put him down anything, but I have been the breadwinner. I have. 

00:48:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. 

00:48:15
TSAI-LING FRAHER I mean he's being… Yeah, I guess just because I've uprooted myself because we're team. I came here because of his career choice. And now I feel like it's so displaced, you know, in the, in the environment that I don't have by own support system. 

00:48:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

00:48:40
TSAI-LING FRAHER Umm… So that's definitely hard to adjust. 

00:48:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO So do you think it will be helpful if you spend some time thinking about how we can continue to really umm… uh… some, somehow access. It sounds like you have some already existing strengths, in terms of being that driving force. Maybe we can spend some time thinking about how we can continue to help you pull from some of those resources that you've been utilizing for many years now, maybe just now on your own. Uh… And thinking about how we can also maybe uh… help you uh… figure out how you maybe found yourself here. And then maybe also help you build a little bit more of a social support for yourself. Will those things be helpful for you based on, based on how you're feeling and where you're at this moment? 

00:49:20
TSAI-LING FRAHER This, this sound great. 

00:49:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. Okay. Great. Let's, let's, let's plan on working on those and then we'll, we'll see where we go at that point. Okay? 

00:49:25
TSAI-LING FRAHER Okay. 

00:49:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO All right. Thank you. 

00:49:25
TSAI-LING FRAHER Thank you. 

00:49:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Huh… 

00:49:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is this a good example of tailoring treatment? 

00:49:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO I think so. 

00:49:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

00:49:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO I think so. Because, you know, I think it, it, it gets that relief, helping uh… me understand number one, uh… what, what might be going on for the client which is critical. But also what those things mean for the client? So I can make a lot of assumptions about what it might mean to feel sad or lonely or whatever it may be. But I need to know what that looks like and what that means for the actual client. 

00:50:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I know you asked her a a few times like what does it look like for, feel like for you. Yeah. 

00:50:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right. Yeah. I think, I think one of the dangers is in making assumptions as a therapist. 

00:50:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. 

00:50:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO And so I don't ever want to make assumptions that I think I know what something might mean for somebody just because I have a general understanding of what that might look like for somebody else. And so, so I think that, that was actually really important for me to, to understand and then to really help her begin to think about what the desired outcomes might be or goals might be for her. Because that helps me also understand where we can begin to set some, some, some, some ground work in, in terms of achieving some of those goals and outcomes for her and what we might begin to do together. 

00:50:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. I noticed that, in a couple different ways you really try to kind of paint that future possibility for her. You know, it sounds like that's tied to, to a potential outcome for her? 

00:50:50
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, you know, I mentioned this. I think I even mentioned this to her. Umm… and I mentioned earlier the idea of that. When people are in this rut and, and in this tough place, that's, that's primarily where their energy in and, and attention is focused. And I feel… And in this… So my goal is really to help them see the alternative to, to see the, the, the exception to that in some ways than and what things can look like, but they have to start thinking about that in some ways. And I think, me even just asking the question helps them at least begin to think about what that might mean for them. Most people know that they, they, there's something wrong and they want to deal with it. But they're not. They haven't really thought about like, what would that look like. 

00:51:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What would right be? Yeah. 

00:51:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO What would right be? What were the other alternative be in some ways? And I think that's important for me because it helps me understand what, what she wants to work towards. And then I can figure out how to help, best achieve that collaboratively together. 

00:51:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. I noticed that, that even she said that, that was helpful. Like she had even thought about that before, she was so focused on kind of maybe the pain and where she was. Umm… that, that, that, that nightmare she's waking up from. And then she's began to talk about the future of the potentials. Oh, that's really helpful. 

00:52:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's a big focus on, on me trying to understand what, what the possibilities are. What's right as opposed to necessarily just focus on what's wrong or what's missing. 

00:52:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Umm… Now we're gonna move to, to our next enactment, which is Extending the Couch to The Community. 

00:52:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Uh-huh… 

00:52:25
Assessment Strategies 

00:52:25
Extending the Couch to The Community 

00:52:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Can you explain to our viewers what you mean by Extending the Couch to The Community or being a cultural broker or therapist? 

00:52:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Sure. Sure. Yeah. You know, to me that's, that's critical because I often ask myself the question and I'll often pose this question to my students. You know, if, if, if, if I only help someone for that 45 to 50 minutes that I have with him or whatever the time frame is. You know, am I, have I done enough? You know, how much have I really done? Especially when I know that for some of the people that I'm working with, they, there are some really uh… difficult situations that they find themselves in, that, that I know they're continuing to negotiate outside the therapy room in some ways. And so I, I feel like our role as, therap, as counselor uh… needs to go beyond just the therapy room, "the therapy room" if you will. I think the therapy room needs to be the, our clients lives in some ways. Now are their limitations? So that there are limitations to that, but, but I want at least want students to, to, to be open to the possibility of intervening in some meaningful way outside of what they're doing in a counseling office, if that makes sense. And so I feel like the idea of extending our couch to the community metaphor is the care. Are there times when I might be able to help my client negotiate the systems in which they may find themselves having challenging, challenging time negotiating? Not to foster dependence on me, but maybe to model and, and to empower umm… you know, uh… their own process in those systems at some point in time. 

00:54:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, and I was thinking that in some ways you're being an advocate, but I also hear there's a therapeutic aspect on this as well, about the modeling aspect. You're advocating for your client, but you're also kind of teaching, showing, modeling about how they can extend, they can do, they can, can take us in the community through their life. 

00:54:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Absolutely. Yeah. And, you know, and it, it's also about, you know, inherently there's trust being built in those processes when, when a client knows that you're willing to make a phone call for them, potentially you're, be on a phone call with them as you're talking to somebody else in the system, a medical person or whoever it may be. Uh… and, and those things can really make a difference in people. There is, there is, there is, there's this assumption that, you know, that, that is primarily what social workers do. And, and I, I think… It's… I don't, I don't believe that. It's think it's what, what, what, what we should all be doing as counselors. And, and I think that that work is inherent in, in, in what, what we need to do to try to heal people in a sense. Again, not to foster dependence, but to empower. And sometimes people just don't know what things look like and how to do things. And I think its okay for me to help them negotiate those processes or at least at the beginning. 

00:55:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah I think that's a recognition how many, in some ways our field is changing that, that therapy is not just in these four walls, right, that there's different ways it can extend out that… One of the community in which their clients actually live, experience and, and work. 

00:55:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think we have to see our roles in that way. And then that's just a very practical tangible way that, that I, I might be able to help someone out and, and negotiate those contexts in essence. Yeah. 

00:55:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON In just a moment we're going to see you work with Jessica. Can you set up this enactment for us? 

00:55:50
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yes. So, so she's, she's having a hard time uh… negotiating uh, her professional relationship with her attorney and she's going through this divorce. And feeling frustrated and, and somewhat uh… anxious about, you know, uh… the conversations that she has and feel like she's not able to communicate very well with her attorney. And so… umm… So I really want the viewers to focus on how I'm trying to assess how I can be helpful for her potentially in that situation umm… by, by helping her see umm… what might be helpful by empowering her to tell me, what I can do and not necessarily making an assumption about what I should do, but really letting her drive the recommendation and then me sorting that out with her to see what's gonna… I don't want to overpower. I don't want to… I don't want to necessarily make an assumption about what I should do and minimize and disempower her in the process. So I think even after she tells me what would be helpful for me, I want to understand what that could look like and what she really, more specifically wants me to do. 

00:57:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it's looking at a ways in which you kind of, want to empower her in a collaborative way that's how working together on this? 

00:57:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right. that's right. 

00:57:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Good. 

00:57:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. 

00:57:10
JESSICA LEONE So I just came from my appointment with my attorney. And I'm just really stressed and really discouraged, just I don't know. I feel like every time I leave that office, like things just don't go the way that I think it's gonna go. 

00:57:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. It sounds like you've been having tough time trying to, maybe you're in difficult time. Is it communicating with your lawyer or just the process internal? What, what… Can you tell me a little bit more about what that mean, what that looks like for you? 

00:57:40
JESSICA LEONE I think I'm just… I don't know. I… I just thought, I've never had to hire a lawyer before and umm… I just keep getting bad news almost like… I don't know. I, I don't want to think this way, but I almost kind of think that my lawyer doesn't know what it's like to… I hired a man umm… and he… I don't just… I worry that he doesn't know what it's like for me as a mother to be fighting over the custody of my children. 

00:58:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. 

00:58:20
JESSICA LEONE And I… You know, I… Like, we've talked about before, you know, like I have a career and I think that I, I don't know like it's… It just doesn't feel right. It just don't feel like he's on my side. I feel like it, always at some point it's, he's questioning my career or how much time I should be spending with that and, you know, it's just. I don't know. It just doesn't feel right. 

00:58:50
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. Okay. You know, you've, you've alluded to this before briefly. You haven't really talked a whole lot about it. Obviously today you're… Uh… it seems like its more salient for you, but I don't think you mentioned in, in other conversations we've had previously. Is there, is there some way that I might be able support your or to help you in, in that process in some ways with your lawyers? Or is there, is there anything, is there something I might be able to do to be helpful? 

00:59:15
JESSICA LEONE Umm… Well, I don't know. I don't really know exactly like what you can do, but I mean like I almost feel like… Because my family's in another country, like it's just kind of hard to, to sort this out with them. We don't necessarily have time to… You know, I can't bring somebody with me to my appointment. And I feel like just having… I mean, I don't know if you'd be able to like be on a conference call with me or something like that. I don't, I don't really know. This is my first time in counseling. So I don't know it's that's appropriate or not. 

00:59:50
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Oh, absolutely. And I think it's absolutely is… I mean, if that's gonna be helpful for you. I mean, I'd feel like my, my responsibility to you is to help you sort out the various contexts too in your life as well and if I can be helpful in some other way or some other contexts that, that will be helpful for you, umm… I'm happy to do that. So yeah, I mean, maybe we can… Maybe you can check with your attorney and see umm… when he or she might be available or we could, maybe the next session we have, umm… you can let him or her know when our next session is going to be. And maybe we can use that time to call your lawyer at that point. And I can certainly be on, on the call and be helpful. Maybe you can tell me a little bit, how about how, what role you'd like me to play in, in, in being on a conference call or, you know, maybe with your attorney with you in some way? What would you like… What would you like… What would you like to look like and what would you like for me to do in that way? 

01:00:45
JESSICA LEONE Well, I notice that, especially when it comes to talking about our kids, I get really emotional and just kind of frazzled and that's not typically how I am, like I said. I'm really… I'm a career woman. I can handle things like this. And I'm just like really surprised by the emotions that are always coming up in my appointments. So like, even right now I feel just flustered coming out of that appointment with my attorney. And I just, just being there to help me communicate with in a clear way. I think would be really helpful. 

01:01:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

01:01:25
JESSICA LEONE And just… I think, just having somebody, feeling that somebody in, in the room or on the call is also on my side. 

01:01:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. 

01:01:30
JESSICA LEONE Would help calm me down, so that I can think clearly and not be so overwhelmed. 

01:01:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. So maybe even, maybe even you can think about some specific things that in case you, you maybe have a difficult time communicating, maybe you can let me know what some of those things might be. You don't have to do that right at this moment, but maybe you can think about umm… If there is certainly, maybe some, some, some highlights or some major things, some takeaways that you want to make sure that, that your attorney leaves the conversation with. And maybe you can share those with me. And if, if at some point you're not… Maybe umm… maybe you've gotten to one of them or maybe as you're trying to communicate one, you're having a difficult time. I can, I can fill in and, and try to uh… maybe uh… help your attorney understand. Or I'll give you a reminder say, hey, Jessica. I remember you also want to talk to him about this and maybe would that be helpful, that kind of role for me to play, it will be helpful for you? 

01:02:30
JESSICA LEONE I think it would. And even like as you're talking about this just umm… You know, actually thinking about what's bothering me in the session with or in, in my meetings with umm… my attorney. I think that will help as well, just kind of like, almost create an agenda for myself, things I need to like say, instead of acting in the moment. 

01:02:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. 

01:03:00
JESSICA LEONE Yeah, it's getting flustered. 

01:03:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah, of course, yeah, yeah. And, and, you know, the one thing I know about you is that, you are resilient and you've demonstrated that through this process of moving through this divorce and continuing to uh… be mom and, and be career woman. And so I… So I don't want to play any role that, that is going to, in some ways reinvent what your attorney is doing with you. And in some ways I want to help empower you in the process. And so you let me know… It sounds like there's a couple ways I could do that. We can come up with an agenda together, that would be helpful to keep you maybe uh… focused in terms of the takeaways. Uh… And then maybe I could play uh… maybe the role of just gently reminding you that, hey, Jessica, you also want to mention this to him umm… and, uh… and then see where that goes. And if at some point you would like for me to maybe communicating thing in particular, you can let me know that at any point in time. I mean, I'll just be there as a support for you. It sounds like that's the most important thing. 

01:03:55
JESSICA LEONE Yeah. 

01:03:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. All right. And we'll plan on doing that and you can maybe let me know what the takeaways will be as you think about it. 

01:04:05
JESSICA LEONE Okay. Thank you. 

01:04:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Great. Great. Sure. 

01:04:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Uh… Well, that was interesting. So I'm wondering is, is that a typical kind of version of how you, you might do, do cultural program? 

01:04:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. It is. For me it is. For me it is. I mean, you know, when I, when I hear… It's like, it's, it's like… What are the… What are people's basic needs sometimes? And, and, and if their basic needs are not being met. As we… This is… This is not new for us. 

01:04:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:04:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO We, we have to we have to me basic needs sometimes before we can address other things. And so if someone is having a real uh… challenge that is uh… creating more stress or distress for them in some ways or another… It's, it's important for me to check in and see. Especially if they have mentioned that, maybe more than once or it seems to be an ongoing concern for them. I do feel like it's my role to check in and see if there's a way that I might be helpful for them in that way. And so that's typically what I'll do for people, knowing that, you know, obviously umm… there might be limitations to what I can do. But I think, nonetheless it's important for me to certainly check in and see if I can be helpful in some meaningful way. 

01:05:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yes, struck me that. You know, here she is… She just came from her, her, her attorneys office. She's feeling that way and, and, you know, in some ways a counselor might say, oh, I should have empathy and, you know, how does that feel? And you did that, but you also kind of, in the immediate moment, the need was, that there's a need that you could help with. 

01:05:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Absolutely. 

01:05:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Or potentially help with. 

01:05:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Potentially help with. I don't know. And, and what that looks like could look at many different ways. I think it's up for her to tell me if there's something I might be able to do. And then I can determine if that's feasible or realistic. And if it's not than maybe we, we kind of, we, we go and hypothesize and think about other ways that we can achieve that same outcome without me having to do something that may not be feasible or realistic potentially. 

01:06:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So I noticed that you asked her a couple times kind of how could you be helpful. 

01:06:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Right. 

01:06:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And my hunch is that, you probably have some ideas in your head, how you could be helpful. 

01:06:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right. 

01:06:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON But you, you went to her twice kind of saying, how could I be helpful for you? 

01:06:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Right. Right. Right. Yeah. and, and I think that's important for me because I don't want to necessarily assume that I know what's gonna be helpful. Even though I might have some ideas, uh… it's, it's, I wanted to come from her. 

01:06:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:06:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO I wanted to come from the client because in essence they are, they are maintaining control over their lives in some ways. That they are, they are learning the skill of, even just asking for help. 

01:06:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. 

01:06:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That, that, that might be important for that particular client to learn how to do that and what that might look like. And so I think, you know, as opposed to me saying, you know, this is what I think might be helpful for you. And I don't typically do that uh…, you know, with, with anybody that I work with. I, I really want to, try to see if they can uh… at least initiate that conversation. And if they need some assistance and thinking about possibilities… Uh… I'm happy to, to, to talk with them about some potential possibility and to see which ones might make sense. But I always give them an opportunity. I don't want to disempower them. 

01:07:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:07:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO The whole goal is to empower. 

01:07:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. 

01:07:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO And so if I take over the situation, then I'm oppressing and disempowering unintentionally. Well intentioned therapists have the potential, have the potential of unintentionally violating their clients at times. And so I always want to be mindful about not doing that in the process of trying to be helpful. 

01:07:30
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So how… I'm assuming it happens sometimes that you ask that question to the client and the client was back and says, sure I want you to do this, this and this or and it's not reasonable or something you really cannot do for whatever reason. How do you manage that? 

01:07:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO I mean, I'll be… I'm very transparent with, with people. You know, that's what I mentioned earlier. I mean, who I am is a, as a, an authentic sincere human being is, is, is really who I try to be in the room with, with, with my clients. And so if it's something that isn't feasible or that maybe I can't do and, or I'm, I'm not, maybe I'm feeling a little bit… There's maybe some uneasiness about it. I'll talk with them about it. I'll talk with them about… So, you know, that, that, that might be… That may not be feasible, but are there other possibilities? And here's why it might not be feasible. Just maybe we can talk about it more. Maybe I'm misunderstanding or maybe I'm not fully uh… you know, appreciating what you're asking. But let's talk about it and so I think… I think the idea of me even just posing the question to somebody is therapeutic, as a therapeutic intervention if you will. And then at that point people know that I'm willing to, to do something for them. So even if I, even if I say, I might not be able to do that, there's not this psyche within forget about it. It's like, well, okay, let's, let's think about this. Let's think of maybe other possibilities. I think we even just creating the space for those possibilities, is incredibly meaningful for people. 

01:08:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. You know, I noticed uh… early on, you know, that she mentioned that, that she had a male attorney umm… and that wasn't working. But she also has a male therapist and I realized you didn't address at that time. 

01:09:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Right. 

01:09:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And I wonder if you would address that at some point or bring that up and kind of talk about that? 

01:09:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO I would. I definitely would. I mean, I think, I think if, if, you know, she's referencing maybe having a difficult time negotiating her relationships with other males in her life and whatever context those may be. It is important, I think… Number one I think it's important. Not necessarily for me to go… It's important for me to understand, umm… you know, what it might… How it's been for her to work with me in that, in this moment in time? But more importantly to reflect on what has helped her connect to me as a male and to be able to kind of trust and develop that trusting relationship with me. So that maybe that will help her create those kinds of relationships with other men in her life in whatever capacity. I think the ultimate goal is trying to help her understand that, hey, you have a relationship with me, how's that been? But also it seems like you trust me at this point. You've expressed that you have some faith and hope in our process. What, what… How did you get there? How did you get there? What helped you get there? And, and let's talk about that. So that, then she maybe has an awareness of what, of what that might look like potentially with other people. Or maybe, maybe she's doing something that may be preventing that from happening. And also, just also understand that maybe it's just other piece… Sometimes not always about the client. 

01:10:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. Right. 

01:10:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO There might just be other people too. And so that even gives us a chance to even talk about that. So I think it is important to address the timing of when to address, it is important. But I think it's, it's important to address at times. 

01:10:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Let's move to our next skill, which is called "Connecting the Therapy Context with the Client Social Relational Context." 

01:10:50
Assessment Strategies 

01:10:50
Connecting the Therapy Context with the Client Social/Relational Context 

01:11:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What exactly is, is Connecting the Therapy Context with the Client Social, uh… Relational Context? What is that? 

01:11:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO It's really looking at the… I think the therapeutic relationship and then how, what have… I think the therapeutic relationship is a microcosm of, of, of what happens I think in client's lives. At least from my perspective and I think from others as well. But, you know, what… The idea of trying to help uh… clients understand what might be happening in the therapy room might also be happening potentially in their, in their relationships outside the therapy room. So that, that isn't always the case, but sometimes they can come up. So in, uh… in this particular situation that came up for the client were what, what was happening in her, uh… in her relationships as she was attempting to build. She was also coming across at times in our own therapeutic relationship and, and it was important to at least bring that awareness for her to do that. So… 

01:11:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So how is this uh… quite an aspect of relapse prevention? 

01:12:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Well, it's, it's, it's… Well, it's part of that skill or government piece in many ways. So, so, you know, umm… really helping clients understand what they may be doing or not doing in essence. And then how, how they can begin to do things differently or, or try to implement or be aware of and be conscious of trying to negotiate. In this case, the relationships that they have with people differently in their lives. Now this, this is, this is I think to me… You know, I come from a very relational context and collectivistic context. And most of the people that I'm working with also come from relational collectivistic context. So to see themselves as separate from the relationships in their lives, for many of them is… And I'd say for all my clients, regardless of whether, is, is impossible. And so, so how can I use potentially uh… my relationship with them as building blocks for them to create in foster, more long lasting, more healthy potential relationships with others they may be struggling with. So and then how can they practice that? How can they… How can they practice that? 

01:13:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:13:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. 

01:13:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON In just a moment we're gonna see you work with Tsai-Ling. Can you set up this enactment for us? 

01:13:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. So umm… So Tsai-Ling was having a difficult time uh… building and extending her social network. Uh… and she was feeling frustrated and, and umm… somewhat expressing some incongruence between… I really want this, but, but it doesn't matter. I'm fine if it doesn't happen uh… in some ways. And so umm… So the idea was to try to help her see that incongruence and to see if there, and to reflect it. Maybe uh… what might be… That she had done that in our, our work together. And might she be doing that in, in some of her other work, uh… in some of her other relationship building with other people. But, but more importantly I want, I want umm…, you know, umm… the viewers to be mindful of me trying to pull from um… already existing strengths that she has and, and already established potential other relationships in her lives. 

01:14:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it sounds like we'll look for kind of maybe that parallel between what's happening out there, what's happening in here, then also look at kind of… And doing so how you're kind of helping her recognize some of her pre-assess strengths and asserts. 

01:14:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right. That's right. 

01:14:15
TSAI-LING FRAHER So I've been trying to connect more people like you suggested. And, and I can see why it's a good idea. And umm… I just get frustrated along the way. I feel like I'm not making the connection that I thought I would be making. Umm… the effort I put, I put forth doesn't seem to be reciprocated by people. 

01:14:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

01:14:40
TSAI-LING FRAHER Umm… I just feel more frustrated and lonely along the way. 

01:14:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

01:14:40
TSAI-LING FRAHER I'm trying. 

01:14:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. And, and… Can you tell me a little bit about or the context where you're trying to build these relationships? Is at work? Is at in some other social setting? Where is it happening? 

01:14:55
TSAI-LING FRAHER I've tried to work. And I've also tried, uh… joined a divorce group. 

01:14:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

01:15:00
TSAI-LING FRAHER Umm… In both places I noticed this, it's the same thing. I, I feel like I'm an outsider. And I, I, I join in. I try to make connections and, but I don't feel… I don't feel the same vibe back from people. A lot of times more with a group of people talking, now I feel I'm the one left out. 

01:15:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. Can you tell me a little bit about what that looks like exactly like when you, when you say, when you say you feel left and maybe what it looks like as you're trying to maybe… What, what that looks like for you to connect with other people? 

01:15:30
TSAI-LING FRAHER Yeah. Umm… I feel like when… this group you're talking… Sometimes along the way I just kind of lose interest in what's being talked about. And, and I, I, I'm not part of the conversation anymore. And when I don't participate, I feel like no one sees me. I could just walk away from the group and no one ever notice. 

01:15:50
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

01:15:50
TSAI-LING FRAHER Umm… Yeah. If I, if I don't contribute, if I don't talk then people don't see me. 

01:15:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. Okay. And is… It's, it's, it's… I just want to check in with you about this again. Developing these relationships with other people is important for you? 

01:16:10
TSAI-LING FRAHER Yeah. I… Yes. 

01:16:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah, it does. Okay. All right. Okay. So you, so you thought like there's just a disconnect as you're trying to, to connect with people at times? 

01:16:20
TSAI-LING FRAHER Yeah. I feel like I try, but I, I don't get the same back. But that's okay. I mean… I don't really need it. It will be nice to have, but I don't… If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out. 

01:16:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. So, so I see you switching a little bit. And, and I've noticed you back seat done that a little bit and here with us at times around when we, when we… Maybe I've checked in to see how you're feeling about uh… a particular situation or how you might be feeling uh… in a session at any given moment in time. And you might say that you're feeling a certain way and then, you know, maybe a minute or two later you like, but I'm fine, I'm okay, I'm good. And, and so I'm wondering actually if umm… how you might be coming across as you're trying to relate and connect with other people at Times? So when I, when I experience that with you sometimes, I'm wondering if, if it's that you're not wanting to talk about those particular issues at that moment in time or how you're feeling or maybe if it's a suggestion that we come up with together, maybe you're not as umm… Maybe wanting to try that uh… A suggestion or maybe work on that in some ways or another. So and I'm not sure that's… If that's how you're intending to come across or uh…, or if, if there's, if, if I may be misinterpreting that… But I'm also wondering how other people might be interpreted as you're trying to build relationships. Does that make sense? 

01:17:50
TSAI-LING FRAHER I think I understand what you're, what you're saying. Umm… My reason is, I don't want to be the one that's there pestering people, be my friend, be my friend. If I tried and tried and you don't pick up, then I'd rather, I'm not a nuisance anymore. 

01:18:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. All right. It is possible that you might umm… approaching some of those relationships with some reservation or, or maybe hesitancy at times potentially? 

01:18:25
TSAI-LING FRAHER This is possible if I'm going there thinking there's a way to retreat. Umm… Yeah, but it just doesn't feel good when you're trying, and trying and people don't pick up. 

01:18:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Right. So, so, so it's sounds like you're, you're feeling like, you know, when you put an effort and something doesn't come out the way that you'd like for it to. I know, I know that when we've… In other situations we've… When we've talked about different situations that come up for you, you tend to be like, I, I want this done with now and I want to over with and I want to move on and I want to keep going. And, and, and I'm wondering is it possible to, to foster and build relationships that way? 

01:19:05
TSAI-LING FRAHER I, I guess it does take some time. 

01:19:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

01:19:10
TSAI-LING FRAHER Yeah. 

01:19:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Let me ask your question. So what… If you, if you think about an uh… of friendship that truly meaningful for you, umm… and maybe one that you had in the past uh, or one that you have back home. Well, tell me what that relationship looks like? 

01:19:25
TSAI-LING FRAHER A meaningful relationship. 

01:19:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah, friendship. Friendship that have with somebody that's meaningful for you that you value. 

01:19:35
TSAI-LING FRAHER I have this high school classmate that uh… That friendship is easy. There's no… It doesn't require work. Like she understood me, and I understood her. Umm… And there's not as feeling of, of… I know she got me. I know she, she guess me. I never feel the sense of, what if she doesn't want there? What if she wanted to hang out with someone else? 

01:20:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

01:20:05
TSAI-LING FRAHER So I guess this is feeling of, like I just trust. 

01:20:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. Did… Let me ask you a question. That, that's a great example. It sounds like a good friendship too. 

01:20:15
TSAI-LING FRAHER Yeah. 

01:20:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Uh… Did you, when you first met this high school classmate… Did you automatically have trust with that person? 

01:20:20
TSAI-LING FRAHER No. 

01:20:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

01:20:20
TSAI-LING FRAHER No… 

01:20:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO So how did, how did you do, how did you… How did you began to, to feel like you could trust this person? How did that… What it that look like for you? 

01:20:35
TSAI-LING FRAHER It, it took some… I guess as you're going with… It did, it did take some uncertainty in the beginning. Yeah. It, it, it did take some time. 

01:20:50
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO But there was something about the relationship that you felt like, this is someone that I want to continue to develop a relationship with in some ways? How do you determine… How do you determine when someone's so important to continue to develop a relationship with, for you? 

01:21:05
TSAI-LING FRAHER How did I determine that? I guess, I, I, I look for someone who's genuine. And I like someone who just says what it is. 

01:21:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. 

01:21:20
TSAI-LING FRAHER I think in a way that, which you could tell me when she didn't want to hang out with me. That I felt like, that's authentic and I didn't feel rejected. 

01:21:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. Yeah. How about… Often in our, in our therapeutic relationship I, I… It seems and you can tell me if this is true or not. It seems like you have some trust in our work together in some ways. How did, how did that happen? How did that come about for you? Is there something that I did? Was there… Was there something that will… You, you, you, you had to allow something to happen too for, for me to be able to continue to work with you and for you to trust me. Do you know what that was? 

01:21:55
TSAI-LING FRAHER I think one of it is, you're, you're very positive with me. You, you help me see the positive things, my strength. And the other thing, it's going back to the authentic, authenticity thing. That you were authentic with me. Like, just, just today you were saying, you pointed out something that, something that I'm little too reserved. Umm… I say something and then I take it back later. 

01:22:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

01:22:25
TSAI-LING FRAHER Umm… But you're saying that to me, I feel like you can tell me things. 

01:22:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. What has allowed you to be able to accept that though from me? What it… What, what, what part have you played in allowing, allowing me to play that role in your life at this moment in time? 

01:22:40
TSAI-LING FRAHER I think believing that you have my best interests in your mind. 

01:22:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

01:22:45
TSAI-LING FRAHER And you're telling me things is to help me. 

01:22:50
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. So, so it's, it seems like the things that are important for you are uh… Someone is authentic, someone who, who you feel like has your best interest in mind in a relationship. It also based on what you said about your friendship with your high school friend that, you can tolerate some uncertainty and ambiguity in terms of beginning a relationship and, and, and working towards developing it. What do you think it's different about the types or the relationship that you're trying to build now that, that, that uh… the, the ambiguity or the uncertainty and, and the, is maybe a little bit harder to negotiate. And it sounds like you just kind of, would like to have the friendship and have it now and kind of… What's different now for you? 

01:23:35
TSAI-LING FRAHER Umm… I think what's different now is, I feel like I'm coming in from outside. That I joined this company, these people already know one another. I joined this divorce group. These people already have a friendship and I'm coming in as a newbie. 

01:23:50
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. But what support I think is that, that, then that all makes sense and I can totally appreciate that. But, but what was, what was evident to me and, and what you… And you described in your other relationship is that, number one you have relationships. 

01:24:00
TSAI-LING FRAHER I do. 

01:24:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO You have other relationships and so that… So, so you have the capa… It sounds like you have the capacity to build relationships, and, and to, to tolerate some level of uncertainty at, at the outset of relationship. And so I'm wondering what do you think would help you begin to uh… be create that and manifest that a little bit more in the relationship you're trying to build now at this moment in time can you think of anything that might be helpful for you to, to utilize some of those resources that you have, that you've already utilized before that you, that you obviously have available to? What would… What would help you access a little bit more and maybe begin to move forward and, and developing those relationships at this point? 

01:24:50
TSAI-LING FRAHER Yeah. Umm… That, that helps me just sort through my head. I, I, I feel like umm… just kind of calming the, the insecurity in me a little bit more. Umm… Because lot of times this is, was inside of head. That, that's making hard to connect. Umm… And another part is just to kind of keep in mind, remember, remember how I made friends, made this great friend in high school. And how in the beginning, it wasn't, it wasn't bond and trust at the first sight. 

01:25:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Right. Right. 

01:25:20
TSAI-LING FRAHER That, that, that's how I have to remember. 

01:25:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO And that you have the capacity to do that. 

01:25:25
TSAI-LING FRAHER Right. Yeah. Yeah. 

01:25:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO In, in essence and I think that's important. I think sometimes when we, are stuck in some place, it's hard to think about the alternatives or the other, other aspects of our lives that may have looked differently at some point in time. It's an, it's a lot that you're negotiating, but it, but, but what's, what's evident is that you've, uh… you've clearly been able to… We've been able to form a relationship together and, and, and then you have other relationships that you have with other people. And so you have the capacity to do that. It sounds like it's a matter of just allowing yourself to, to be mindful of that in an essence and, and to think about what, what more, what you can do a little more intentionally sometimes as you're trying to build these relationships in someway. It sounds like there might be some mistrust of people at the outset. And, and so umm… it sounds like it's… From other relationships that you've built that there was not trust there to begin with, with some of these individuals. I always try to remind folks too that, you, you, you, you can start a relationship with somebody and if it doesn't turn out to be the kind of relationship that you wanted in a point in time, you can always make a different decision about that relationship. And so I think what, what also might be helpful is thinking, not thinking that these relationships that I'm trying to build need to be like, life long lasting relationships. And I wonder if that feels like that might feel some pressure. 

01:26:45
TSAI-LING FRAHER Right. Right. And I think… That's what mine, mine mindset right now. I think maybe because going through a divorce that, that the, the interruption of marriage that really got me hypersensitive to how other relationships will, will play out. 

01:27:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. Yeah. 

01:27:05
TSAI-LING FRAHER I think, yeah… 

01:27:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. All right, that's helpful. Good. 

01:27:10
TSAI-LING FRAHER Yeah, it's helpful. Thank you. 

01:27:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Great. 

01:27:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So we… In, in the clip we just saw, we, we got to see kind of how you negotiated your relationship with Tsai-Ling, umm… but also tied it to, to her outside kind of experience and try and trying to create this bigger social network. Is that a typical version of kind of doing that? 

01:27:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO It is. Yeah, I mean, I… You know, I, again… You know, you saw me ask that, ask her the question that thinking about uh… an ideal relationship, friendship that she has. And, and, and really looking at that as the foundation to build from in essence and trying to help her get a sense of… You know, how did that relationship start? And I even asked her the question, you know, what happened in our relationship that you, you developed that? And she said authenticity and… 

01:27:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Right. Right. She said pretty quickly too. Yeah, she's aware of that. 

01:27:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. Right. Right. And so, and than I you know, connected her back to… Number one she has the capacity to develop relationships. Uh… And be at… Just trying to help her see that. Number one, she has that capacity, but then to remind her and reflect on, you know, that you've done this before. What did it look like? How did that happen? What was different about then than now? And how could we pull from then to apply it to the now in some ways, in meaningful way to help you move forward in those relations? 

01:28:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, recognize how you were able to tie, kind of, her past, that she's understanding the past, the present. You're doing that with me right now. You know, and, and then the frustration about maybe not seeing the same success outside. 

01:28:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right. 

01:28:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON And then kind of drawing those, how those three things connect. 

01:28:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right. That's right. Yeah. And that's a sense of what that, that, that, that principle for me really represents. 

01:28:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. And you really did kind of really encourage her to think back to the past. When she's done this before, she mentioned her high school friendship. 

01:28:50
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right. That's right. And she came up with some um… some underlying principles that were, that really she could pull from to then begin to implement, you know, going forward. 

01:29:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. And you're also, I realized, when you're asking her about connecting with you. You really, you really wanted her to kind of own what she had done. 

01:29:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO What he had done. 

01:29:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON In session to make that connection with you. 

01:29:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Right, that's right. Yep. Because when she said, I'm authentic. That's great. I'm, I'm glad that I come across as authentic. But more importantly what role did you play in allowing me to remain authentic or to even be continue to be present? And I think that's the piece where I think the empowering is, is important and pulling from already existing internal resources and strengths. 

01:29:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON It was funny because again end of that clip, again she seemed like she had gained some self-awareness. 

01:29:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. Yeah. And so treatment adherence seen, and, you know, at that, that whole pace of like, something must be happening that's impacting them in some ways because she's reflecting that back to me. I'm checking in with her about it. She's reflecting it back to me. And then she's also trying to, umm… ,you know, to, to implement what we're talking about in her life. 

01:30:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. Why don't we move on to, to our next enactment, which is called "Creating Reminders." 

01:30:10
Assessment Strategies 

01:30:10
Creating Reminders 

01:30:10
(Relapse Prevention) 

01:30:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What exactly is Creating Reminders? 

01:30:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO It's really tied to this idea of relapse prevention in many ways. Not only as we're talking about skill development, but we're also talking about, you know, you know, that idea of, of um, increasing in awareness, self awareness in many ways. And I, and I feel like the creating reminders as a way to document. Documentation can look many different ways for different people, but successes, positive outcomes for people. I think it's so easy for us to forget about what we've done that's right. It's easier… When people are in a, in a, in a challenging situation, it's so much easier to focus on what's wrong than what's going right. And sometimes they, they don't even recognize when something good has happened or something different has happening. And so pointing those out, reflecting on those and then trying to create ways so that they can remember and not forget about what has just happened that has been successful, uh, advantageous for them and created a different positive outcome in some ways. 

01:31:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Are these kinds of just mental memories or these actual tangible, tangible reminders? 

01:31:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO You know, for, for, for most, for the most part it, it, it's, it's tangible for people. You know, sometimes people, you know, you'll, you'll hear from Jessica, you know, that umm… Initially she's trying to figure out what that would look like for her. And I asked her the question, you know, uh… when you want to remember something what do you do? You know, whether it's something a quote, someone something said and, and so it could be very tangible in some ways. Um… But it could be journaling, it could be taking pictures of things, it could be telling family and friends. Hey, you know, if you see me doing this, just kind of give me a nudge so that I don't do it again, those kinds of things. 

01:32:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So it's, in some ways it sounds like its extending kind of gains, uh… things that have worked. And I mean in a way kind of implanting them into your context environment. 

01:32:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO And that's right. And consciousness, so it could be internal. It could be internal to for some people. Umm… But most people have a unique way of remembering something that's important to them. And so all I'm trying to do is to, to build and to, to use that as a foundation, to help them remember successes and positive outcomes that they've had. So that they can remember to implement those going forward at some point in time, when I'm not around, which is important for me. 

01:32:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. In just a moment we're gonna see you work with Jessica. Can you set up this enactment? 

01:32:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. So uh… so Jessica actually came in and she'd been having trouble developing and building her social support network. Uh… she came in and said that it's getting better, things are, things are working for her. And uh… and so she's, uh… she's feeling good about where that is at this moment in time. And so I'm really trying to help her reflect on what's been working for, what's been helpful and then to find ways to document that, so that she can remember going forward. 

01:33:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:33:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Hi, Jessica. 

01:33:05
JESSICA LEONE Hi. 

01:33:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO So I know that we've been working on helping you develop uh… stronger, a stronger social support network. And, and you'd mentioned that, you feel like that was getting better and its better. And even uh… when we started talking today, you mention that you were feeling pretty good about that. And what do you… What do you think's been helpful for you and, you know, developing those social relationships and building your social network a little bit? What resources have you been using or uh… to help you do that if you will? Either internal or external, what, what does that look like for you? 

01:33:40
JESSICA LEONE Well, umm… I've been attending that divorce support group, uh… that we've talked about before. Umm… And I've actually gotten to know some of the people in there. Umm… I've yet to hang out with them outside of the group, but I still, I attend weekly and umm… It's just nice to be able to talk about things with people that are in similar situations. 

01:34:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. 

01:34:05
JESSICA LEONE So umm… Let's see. I've also… I started to… Well, I joined a gym. 

01:34:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

01:34:15
JESSICA LEONE And so instead of working out on my own, I'm taking classes. And I'm trying to take them at the same time every week umm… just so that, you know, some of the familiar faces. And I'm thinking that I can like start making more friends that way. 

01:34:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. 

01:34:30
JESSICA LEONE Umm… I have my eye on a book club that I heard of through my kids preschool. Umm… Some of the, the parents there umm… they have a book club that's, that's active and I'm interested in that. So I've, I've asked about it. I've got to join, but I'm definitely, I'm interested in it. Yeah. 

01:34:50
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. So it sounds, it sounds like you're actually trying to situate yourself or insert yourself in different social networking communities, the gym, the book club, potentially the divorce group etcetera. Umm.. I know and earlier on you were feeling some, maybe hesitancy or reluctance to… What… What has helped you, maybe in some ways develop more of this openness to work and willingness to seek out these other support networks at this point in time? Do you know what, what, what's been, what's helped you access that a little bit more? 

01:35:25
JESSICA LEONE I think just like taking baby steps with it. 

01:35:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

01:35:30
JESSICA LEONE Umm… I used to be really intimidated and I still am. I'm still intimidated about social situations. But umm… just realizing that I don't have to throw myself into a group and be best friends with everybody immediately. But that kind of helped and umm… that's something that like you've helped me realize it's just learning to take it slow and do what's comfortable for me. 

01:35:50
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. 

01:35:55
JESSICA LEONE So I wish I could, you know, totally be in that book club right now and have all these friends, but that's not the situation right now. So umm… you know, just being patient with that has been really helpful for me. Yeah. 

01:36:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. Good. Good. So you've, you've really, you've really tapped into umm… slowing yourself down. And, you know, it sounds like in some ways also adjusting your expectations of what to, what, what to expect when you start, starting a relationship or developing a social support network in some ways and then being patient. So those, those sound like, those have been um… really great resources and assets for you, as you really started to, to expand your, your uh… social support. How can we… I'm gonna… I'm gonna… I'm gonna use word document. But when I say document that really… It's almost like a reminder in some ways. That can look any way really for, for different people. But how can we and somehow make ensure that you remember these different, these different assets and resources that you're relying on at this point, being patient, having realistic, maybe, maybe making sure that your expectations match whatever the situation may be. A little bit more, there's a congruence there and then maybe taking baby steps and slowing yourself. But how can we… What would be helpful in terms of for you umm… umm… creating some reminders or, or documenting these down in some ways to, so that you can continue to remember and utilize some of these uh… some of these resources that you are using now in the future? 

01:37:30
[sil.] 

01:37:35
JESSICA LEONE I think um… What's really helpful is to memory the positive aspects of just those little social interaction. So, you know, umm… For example the other night, I was at the gym and I was at yoga class that I usually attend. And one of the woman, that she also attends on regular we… We had a little conversation afterwards, after the class. And I think what is helpful… I don't know how I would necessarily document this, but something that makes me want to do in again, is I just try not to think about the negative part or I like trying not to myself up, of what I could have said or something like that. Instead I just kind of tell myself like, well, at least you guys talked and at least it was a pleasant conversation and maybe that will be good. Yeah. 

01:38:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. All right. Let me add… Let me… Maybe this might be helpful. I think it's a good example. When you don't want to… When you… When you want to make sure you remember something and you don't want to forget it. What do you do at this point to ensure that you remember it that you don't forget that? It could be anything. And it could be a story, it could be a book you saw, whatever, it could be someone something said, something someone said to you. What, what do you do to, to ensure that you remember something that's meaningful for you that you don't forget it 

01:38:50
JESSICA LEONE I think… Well, usually… For example, with my kids, something that's like really happy and memorable, I'll take a picture. I think that would be really weird to do considering I don't have friends yet, you know, like stable friends. Yet, I'm not gonna this woman to take a picture with me after the gym cost. But, umm… I also think, I've been journaling a little bit too. 

01:39:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

01:39:15
JESSICA LEONE Umm… Mostly, I journal about the books that I read. 

01:39:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

01:39:20
JESSICA LEONE Umm… But, maybe I can start journaling about, like the, the good things that, the interactions that I've had. 

01:39:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO If it's something you're already doing that you maybe find helpful… It sounds like you do that to remember highlights from the book and things that stand out to in some ways. 

01:39:35
JESSICA LEONE Yeah. 

01:39:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Maybe that's something we could start with as a, as a, as a starting point and you can journal and, and create some reminders for yourself about what's working for you and what's been helping you, uh…, you know, build these networks a little bit better in some ways. I think you could also write it down in a piece of paper and take a picture of it and put that somewhere if you wanted to. 

01:39:55
JESSICA LEONE Yeah. 

01:39:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO You could maybe um… be patient, uh… slow down. Umm… You know, what… That the… All the different aspects of your, you know, realistic expectations. Uh… You know, and just… If pictures are helpful for you um… maybe you can write one or two word mantras if you will on your, on a postcard or, or something or somewhere. And maybe take a picture of that and, and journal at the same time or put them as reminders in some way. I don't know. I don't… That would make sense for you. 

01:40:30
JESSICA LEONE You know, I actually kind of like that idea better than mine. Umm… I don't… I say that journaling would work, but I also don't see myself sitting down and reflecting about that one time, that I'm not that girl at the dam, that we had a really fun conversation. Umm… But I think… Yeah, I like how you said, almost like mantras, just kind of, you know, like something that got me through that conversation. So I do… Yeah, I like that. 

01:41:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO One, and the, the things that we just mentioned. Now those resources, those strengths that you're using, those assets, umm… those, those can be written down into one or two words on a postcard. You can place it somewhere. If, if you like pictures, take a picture of them and have them some place meaningful for you. That maybe more helpful given that… It sounds like pictures are, are meaningful for you. So that you can remember those good. And maybe that might be in a way to start. Let's… Why don't we play with that a little bit and see what that might look like for you? Maybe just start by even just writing them down on a postcard and umm… and then see what that means for you and, and putting them, you know, by your bed somewhere or in your, in the mirror, in the bathroom or whatever it may be or take a picture and, and maybe you can decide what will make sense for you after you think about it for a minute and then, and then we can give it a shot and see what that looks like. 

01:41:50
JESSICA LEONE Okay. Yeah. 

01:41:50
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Great. Good. 

01:41:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Miguel, is, is that a typical way in which you might implement creating reminders in a session? 

01:42:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah, it is. You know, I think… I think it's so easy for, for individuals not to think about what went right. I think it's much easier to think about what's not going well. And so, so I really want to try to really, with some intentionality help them reflect on and remember like what they did that worked for them. What was helpful for them? How they got from point A to Point Bible? But more importantly, figure out how we can help them remember uh…, you know, that going forward. And that's the idea with, of creating reminders. It's, it's obviously it's a relapse prevention uh… process as well, so that they can rely on those reminders and, and, and, and whatever that may look like for them, for her. Um… You know, she took pictures of, of, you know, her kids when they were in a happy good place. And so I said, well, maybe you can write uh… a couple words down and on a postcard and take a picture of that, a mantra and take a picture of that if you want to or just try the postcards as… Uh… so that, you know, she, she, she mentioned three very distinct aspects that helped, has helped her develop those relationships. And so I… We really broke those down and said, hey, there are three tangible things that you mentioned here and how can we uh… make sure that you don't forget about that. So you can continue to utilize those when you're finding yourself struggling… 

01:43:20
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. I saw that initially like you were really um… A few times you said, you know, how do we document this? And really, really wanted to document it. 

01:43:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Right. And I use documentation as a very broad term. It, it, it, it really can look what in, whatever way the client thinks it needs to look. It doesn't… It's not really for me, it's, it's for them to find something meaningful. Like I mentioned, it could be journaling, it could be reminding, family and friends to nudge them, when, maybe they're doing something that, that they maybe want to be reminded not to do. Uh… It could be taking pictures. It, it, it could be a number of different things for people and I think it just varies. I want to find what's gonna be the most meaningful for the individual, so that it will be something that they will actually implement and something that they will, it will be helpful for them. 

01:44:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, I noticed that again, we talked for about how you want to work with the client on this and just coming up with a couple of ideas. Three things she want to work on, then you had some ideas. And you really tailored something that, that she really liked at the end. 

01:44:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Right. Yeah. Yeah. So it was fortunate. It worked that time. It worked for her and we, we found a good match for her, which is important. So… 

01:44:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. Great. Why don't we move to, to our next skill uh… which is Promoting Treatment Adherence. 

01:44:35
Assessment Strategies 

01:44:35
Promoting Treatment Adherence 

01:44:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What is the process of promoting treatment appearance? 

01:44:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Well, for me it's a, it's a way for me to assess and evaluate umm… how things are… Number one, where the client is any given moment in time? The promoting treatment adherence, again it happens throughout the process. 

01:44:55
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So there's a process, right? It's an ongoing thing. 

01:45:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO It's an ongoing thing. And I think that's something that I do regularly with, with clients. Um… But it's a way for me to assess in some ways where they are heading, any given moment in time, based on some of the things that we're working on. 

01:45:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Okay. 

01:45:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. 

01:45:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What happens during this? What kind of skills you might use, want to do? 

01:45:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Well, you know, you know, I don't… I mean, I won't use any particular outcome measures per say, but I, I'll use umm… You know, I, I might use like a, like a scaling method, the, the scaling technique if you were aware. You know, 0 to 10. Zero is the worst it can be and 10 is the best it can be. You know, it's similar to like uh… subjective units of distress scale. There's different… There's different versions of this. I think, you know, we, we all kind of have some of the make sense for us. But I, I, I may ask the, the individual, you know, umm…, you know, under the skills 0 to 10. You were here before. Where are you at this point with what we're working on, with this particular Aspect? And see where they are and then, and then have a discussion about that. Whether it's working, whether it's not and what's helped? What hasn't been helpful and how can we build from there? 

01:46:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. So it's an ongoing kind of process. 

01:46:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Ongoing. 

01:46:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON In which you're kind of saying again is, is, is there a match between what's happening in session, what, and what the client wants to happen in the real world? 

01:46:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right. That's right. And then… And, and making sure that it's actually working. 

01:46:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Actually working. Yeah. Good. 

01:46:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO It's working. It's working at the end of the day. Yeah. 

01:46:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. And now we're gonna see you work, work with Tsai-Ling. Can you set up this enactment? 

01:46:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Sure. Yes, Tsai-Ling umm… was dealing with… Had been dealing with some uh… some sadness and some loss and some grief over the, the ending of her marriage. And uh… and so I was checking in with her after having, had a few sessions with her and having done some work with her, where she was at this moment in time with regards to those emotions, regarding her divorce. 

01:46:40
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. Great. Great. 

01:46:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Hi, Tsai-Ling. 

01:46:45
TSAI-LING FRAHER Hi. 

01:46:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO How you're doing? 

01:46:45
TSAI-LING FRAHER Better today. 

01:46:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Better. Good. Good. I wanted to check in with you. Umm… You know, I've done this before, but I want to check in with you around. Uh… You… You know, we've been, we've been working on trying to help you uh… feel a little bit, uh… a little more connected and less isolated. And, and, you know, you mentioned, you're feeling sad and some loneliness about and maybe even grieving the loss of your, of your relationship, your marriage in some ways. So I wanted to… You know, I've done this before with you. Give the scale from 0 to 10… Zero. I just remind you zero's, the worst it could actually be and ten is the best it could actually be. Remember, when we first started talking about your feelings of sadness and loneliness, you were around one or two actually. And I wanted to see today on the, on the scale from zero to ten, uh… where you might be. And remember zero is the worst and ten is best it could be. Where were you today at this point? 

01:47:40
TSAI-LING FRAHER Umm… as far as sadness and… I, I feel drastic difference. I feel like, maybe a six or seven… Yeah. 

01:47:50
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's a pretty significant improvement actually. Do you know what's been helpful for you and helping you get from no one or two to the six? 

01:47:55
TSAI-LING FRAHER I think what been helpful is just, you helping me to talk through, think through. What is really bothering me? What is… What is really preventing me from making connections with people? And, and once I can work through those and I can actually make some connections. And I don't, I don't read peoples reactions to me in the negative way anymore. So that has been helpful. 

01:48:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. Good. Good. You know… Are you feeling like you want to continue to work towards even building that, even that getting to the ten at some point? 

01:48:25
TSAI-LING FRAHER Right. I feel like… I feel like it's being a city umm… inclining. If you like, it's, it's working that way. Umm… I'm, I'm making better connections with people and I've more friends now that I fell like be… I can be authentic and the authentic with me which is very important to me. 

01:48:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. So you've been doing a lot of work outside of therapy on your own in many ways. What it… What's helped you implement what we've done here and what's, what's, what's, what's helped you here? What's helped you implement what we were doing here and in your, in your actual real life? 

01:49:00
TSAI-LING FRAHER I think, just knowing that it could happen. I feel like I get a lot of umm… answers here to… As, as to why I feel certain way? Why I see things at a certain way? And I can take those into umm… to, to real life just to… Whenever something happens I can like process it and think it about it. 

01:49:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. So is it… So is it safe for me to interpret that is that, what we're doing here is, is, is congruent with what you're wanting to work on and also the, the, the experiments or if you will or homework assignments that we've been talking about have been uh… realistic for you and feasible for you to implement and manageable? 

01:49:35
TSAI-LING FRAHER Yes. Yes. Those are very… Those are very helpful. Because every week I feel, like I'm making a little progress. It's not so daunting. It's not so umm… 

01:49:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Well, those are the things that we've come up with together. So you've really been the driving force and thinking about how to make that, make that happen. But you've also uh… implemented them. So I think that's, that's, that's a testament to, to your work and, and the things that you've been putting into our time together. That's good to know. That's good to know. 

01:50:00
TSAI-LING FRAHER Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for your help. 

01:50:00
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Uh-huh… 

01:50:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I wonder if this is a typical way in which you might, might assess treatment adherence. 

01:50:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO It is. Yeah. You know, as you, as you saw I had said to her, you know, this is something we've done before. Uh… and when I checked in with you around zero to ten before you were around a one or two or somewhere in there. And where are you now? And, and, you know, uh, most importantly is, is around the discussion that follows after like, what helped you get there? What's been helpful for you? Uh… Because again, I'm really, really looking at it… Everything is from a strength based, looking at already existing resources and, and then how we can build and build from those. And so really it was a rather just asking her to, to kind of assess where she was at that moment in time, it gives me a sense that things are, are working, it sounds like from what she's saying and what she's rating her feelings are at that moment in time. And then having a discussion about how we can… What's been helpful and how to continue to move forward. 

01:51:00
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah, I noticed that you, you assess, but then you really promoted like you're assessed and you promoted what is working and kind of pushing that forward, and let's do more of that. 

01:51:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right. That's right. Yeah, that's exactly right. 

01:51:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. Why don't we move to, to our final skill, which is the use of a boaster session? 

01:51:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Great. 

01:51:20
Assessment Strategies 

01:51:20
Booster Sessions 

01:51:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON What are booster sessions? 

01:51:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Good question. You know, it's, it's an opportunity for umm… It's really a check in. It's a check-in. It's, it's an opportunity for, for clients to uh… maybe, uh… come back in and, you know, literally get a boost and, and a reminder if you will and to, to come in check in again. I think they serve a few purposes. One is to umm… you know, check in with a client to see how what we've worked on and what we did work on in therapy and how that's still continuing to unfold for them in some ways. Umm… It's to, to remind them of some of the things that they have been using and, and some of the strings and resources that they have available to them which, which you see is more than one they will end therapy with. They have been able and so, reminded with that. And then also normalizing the process of umm… you know, life happening. And things maybe not always looking exactly the way they wanted to, but that's just a normal part of the process as well. 

01:52:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Is this… uh… Would you use this like after three months or six months or kind of a follow up, check in? 

01:52:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO It… It really depends. It really depends on the clients and what the issues are. Sometimes… You know, sometimes I may recommend. Let's do a check in. And like, a month from now or let's do a check in, you know, two or three months from now. Sometimes umm…, you know, a client will just contact me and, and maybe say, hey, you know. Can I check in, like, you know, three or four months from now? Sometimes I… We may, we may terminate and, and umm… ,you know, clients, uh… most of the clients that I work with know that they can always come back in and they need to check in at some point or need to revisit and… So I may get a call six months from now from someone and say, hey, you know, can, you might if I come in to give you an update and just check in with you and um… just, just for one session? 

01:53:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:53:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO And, you know, so it can, it can look at several different ways. 

01:53:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That sounds like there are variety of ways in which you might use this. 

01:53:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yes. 

01:53:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Client driven. Uh… maybe planned three, six months, when your annual kind of thing. Umm… 

01:53:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. Yeah. And it could be good for really continuing to empower some clients as well. It's like, you know, let's go work on this. Let's check back in a month or two. Let's see where you're at. And, and, you know, so they give them some, some confidence and motivation to, to work on those things. 

01:53:35
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON I mean, it really is a booster, it's a boost. 

01:53:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO It is a booster. It's a boost. That's the intent. That's the intention of it. Yeah. 

01:53:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. So in a moment we're gonna see you work with Jessica. I wonder if you could kind of show our viewers or tell our viewers what, what you're gonna do? 

01:53:50
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. Sure. So Jessica, uh… you know, contacted me and it's been about six months and she's been in. She's… She's starting to, to date and, and her, and she's feeling some excitement, but also some fears and some anxieties about recreating the, the same kind relationship that she uh… had to terminate it. And, and so she's wanting to just get a check in and see, updating where things are, but also umm… just talk a little bit about where her anxiety is at this point around the new relationship. 

01:54:25
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Okay. 

01:54:25
JESSICA LEONE Hi. 

01:54:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Hi. Hi, Jessica. It's been… It's been a while. 

01:54:25
JESSICA LEONE It has. 

01:54:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah, it's good to see you. 

01:54:30
JESSICA LEONE Yeah, good to see you too. Umm… Yeah, it's like, I'm here in like six months. Umm… So I've some updates for you. Umm… I started dating. 

01:54:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Oh, okay. Congratulations. 

01:54:40
JESSICA LEONE Thank you. 

01:54:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. Good. 

01:54:45
JESSICA LEONE Thanks. 

01:54:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Is that a congratulations? 

01:54:45
JESSICA LEONE Yes, yes, yes. Yeah. 

01:54:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Good. Okay, okay, good. 

01:54:50
JESSICA LEONE Umm… Absolutely. I didn't expect to be dating so quickly. So it's a pleasant surprise. 

01:54:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

01:54:55
JESSICA LEONE Umm… but that's also why I'm here again. Umm… Is, I just, I feel myself filling with… I just feel myself filled with doubt. And, you know, go out umm… with this new guy and we've been dating for, not that long, about, you know, like three months. 

01:55:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

01:55:20
JESSICA LEONE Umm… And we're taking it slow. It's good. But I also… So we'll have a really good date. And then afterwards, always go home and just kind of feel… Just like questioning myself. And I'm just worried about… You know I was in that marriage for quite some time. And I thought it was a happy marriage. And apparently it wasn't. He left me. And so when I'm like really happy and excited, I notice and I start to worry. Is it just me that's happy and excited? Or is it… You know, is he also feeling happy and excited or is he having other thought? 

01:56:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. Yeah. 

01:56:15
JESSICA LEONE And I just, I don't… I don't know what to do. I just feel myself turning my wheels on this. 

01:56:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. It, it, it… Well, let me just say that. I think how you're feeling at this moment in time feels umm… it's normal. I mean, it's, it's a normal that you're starting it, after having been through a divorce, you spent some time since you uh, initiate that situation and, and where we are now at this point. And so I think some of what you're experiencing is, is fairly normal in terms of starting a new relation. It's scary to start a new relationship, especially after having one for, that was in your life for so long. Umm… What, what do you think it's been helpful for you though, I mean, you know, you, you've started a relationship and so something has allowed you to get to that point to be able to at least begin to trust somebody I would assume. There's, there's some trust there for you to feel like you have to be with someone for three months, is that true? Do you feel like there's some trust there in this person? 

01:57:15
JESSICA LEONE Yeah, absolutely. So umm… Since my divorce this is like the longest dating sort of relationship that I've, I had since my divorce. And I haven't really been invested with anybody either than this guy. Umm… So, yeah, he really is one of the first people that I've trusted, if not the first person that I've trusted. 

01:57:40
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. And what do you think helped you get to the point of even being able to trust somebody again? What, what helped you get there? 

01:57:50
JESSICA LEONE I think what's helped is me getting more friends umm… because when I was with my husband, I didn't have very many friends. And so I'm very much relied on him for a lot of support. Umm… Just emotional, any, any social life that I had was all around him. And uh… I think just having a group of friends is just kind of opened my eyes to umm… how it's nice to, to have people to rely on. 

01:58:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. 

01:58:25
JESSICA LEONE Yeah. 

01:58:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO So, so by building your friendships, friendships with other people that's also allowed you to begin to build a romantic relationship with somebody else? 

01:58:35
JESSICA LEONE Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. 

01:58:35
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's nice. And so, okay, all right. And, and what is it about having the, the friendships that, that you think is, is meaningful for you? I mean, what, what is… What has that allowed you to pull from yourself to move forward and to start other relation, rather romantic relationships? 

01:58:50
JESSICA LEONE I think it's helped my self-esteem honestly. 

01:58:55
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. Okay. Okay. 

01:58:55
JESSICA LEONE Yeah. I use to really retreat and just be by myself a lot. Umm… because I was afraid by other people, would think of me or… I don't know. I guess I just didn't feel like I had much to offer other people. Umm… And so having friends or getting, you know, more friends now. Umm… I'm kind of noticing that, you know, I do have a lot in common with other people. 

01:59:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. It sounds like you also learn that you have something to offer other people. That's important in a sense, right? 

01:59:30
JESSICA LEONE Yeah. 

01:59:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO What, what, what were some of the… Remember, we came up with… I don't know if you remember we came up with some umm… assets and strings that you had that, as you were building relationships. Do you remember what those were? That we've… I know we talked about developing and documenting those in someway or other. Do you remember what those some of those uh… strings of you as were and, and assets that you were using and building your relationships? 

01:59:55
JESSICA LEONE Yeah. Umm… You know what always… What seems to help me is, you know, just realizing that umm… I've gone through a lot of stuff in my life and always pulled through. And I've been able to, at the end of the day find my happiness. And so just kind of acknowledging that even though I'm not happy in that moment, I could be happy later on, that, that unhappiness isn't forever. Umm… And then a lot to just being patient and working on being a little bit kinder to myself. 

02:00:30
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. Remember, being patient was one, umm… slowing yourself down a bit in the process, and, and also have a realistic expectations in the process. I mean, one of the things that you also, and, and you had also mentioned that, you know, when we had our sessions previously was that, you're feeling more confident in your ability to kind of determine or maybe a more… What a healthy versus maybe an unhealthy relationship might look like. And I would, I would assume you still have that capacity some months later to be able to do that, is that, is that a fair assessment or assumption to make? 

02:01:10
JESSICA LEONE I… Well, I think that's what I'm doubting now. 

02:01:10
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Okay. 

02:01:10
JESSICA LEONE I think that's where… I think like I'm getting emotional and, you know, I'm really starting… I'm starting to like this guy and so with that I'm becoming more doubtful of that. I tell myself that, but I don't know what's… 

02:01:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO So would it… So would it be helpful to, to remind yourself to be, to remember to be patient, to, to slow down a bit, to maybe kind of have realistic expectations about were things are at this moment in time, like you had done previously with other… I know it's a romantic relationship, that changes a little bit. But it sounds like you also have some external sources of support. Now that you can also check in with and talk with as well if you're feeling some uncertainty or some doubt at times. Is that… Is that true? 

02:02:00
JESSICA LEONE Yeah. That's, that's helpful. Umm… Some of my friends, umm… ,you know, I'm able to kind of check in with them, when I'm just feeling insecure. You know, is this something that I talk to this guy about or do I… I, I tend to not talk about things that I'm struggling with. They tend to kind of retreat. So umm… You know, having… 

02:02:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO You know, that's one of your, one of your, one of your old ways of kind of dealing is to remove yourself and to disowning yourself and to… 

02:02:25
JESSICA LEONE Yeah. So just remembering that, that's not what I want to do anymore. That's not my goal anymore. So it's helpful to have friends to hold me to that uh… and check in on me, umm… with that. So… 

02:02:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Just… As we think about just what… It can be helpful also going forward. You know another way to kind of create some reminders if you will is to, maybe have your friends, close friends, or the, the network you're around um… reminds you maybe when you might be doing something that you don't want to do. Sometimes that could be helpful if you have some really one or two close friends that you have at this point that you might be able to say. Hey, if you see me doing this, then maybe, maybe just let me know, so that I… You know, I'm not falling into old patterns again in some ways. It sounds like you're doing well though. And things are going well and it just want, needed some refreshers and some reminders and about you're the, the resources that you've been pulling from for so long already and just, just continue to do that. 

02:03:35
JESSICA LEONE Yeah. I've noticed that sometimes when I am getting emotional, I forget those resources. So coming here definitely kind of helped me relax a little bit and just I've a couple more tools. 

02:03:45
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Yeah. And also go back to reminders whether it's your pictures or your journal, what, you know, whatever, the different formats that you used to document those successes, so that you can hopefully continue to rely on those. And it sounds you have even more resources available to you now than you did six months ago, which is also really helpful for you to, to utilize as well. 

02:04:05
JESSICA LEONE Yeah. 

02:04:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Good. Great. 

02:04:05
JESSICA LEONE Thank you. 

02:04:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Uh-huh… 

02:04:10
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON So, Miguel, is, is that a pre-typical booster session? 

02:04:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO It is. You know, I, I really the client… As I do with with most sessions. Let the client drive the, the content and the focus. And so, you know, she, she really came in checked in around just some of uh… were she's at this moment in time. And uh… we reflected on, you know, how she got there. Reminding… Those, those like reflecting on, you know, you're, you're dating? You were doing that before. How'd you get there? What's helped you get there? And, and thinking about some of those things and, and then reminding her of, of, of the, the strengths and resources that she's been using and has available to her, to continue to rely on. And then again normalizing… If you will umm… You know, some of the, umm… normalcy and starting a relationship is just, it's just scary. It's just… Most people would feel that way. And so there's… That's, that's okay too. 

02:05:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON You know, I noticed that, you know, she brought up kind of new things that are happening. And I was thinking that you didn't really dig too deep into those new issues, seem like you kind of looked more at reinforcing or reminding her strengths, assets, and resource that she's been through this before and this is normal. But you never like kind of dig deep into things. 

02:05:20
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO Right. Right. And that may, that may depend on the client. I mean, you know, for, for… If someone says, I just want to come in and see you one time. You know, I may not necessarily dig too deep into some of those. As I may, I may comment about it and say, you know, I know you mentioned this, you know, how are things in that area. But, but it may, it may just be around… They just may want to come in and… If I… If… For example, if I'm doing a booster session with someone and I say, let's check in. I say, let's check in a month or two and see where things are at and they bring up uh… one of the depression. I, I may, I may spend a little bit of time talking about that because if I'm saying let's check in a month or two, it's because I'm wanting to keep the client moving in that, in that positive direction. And if there are things that might be challenging that in some ways, it's important to address it. If someone contacts me, I might address it, I may not address it, depending on the, the conversation, depending on where the client is and depending on what his or her needs are at that moment in time. Because I'm… Remember, I'm really trying to, to foster, uh…, you know, the best therapy is self-awareness and insight, you know, and how to heal oneself ultimately and so that's really the goal. I'm not trying to hurry and push people out of the door per say, but at the same time umm… I'm wanting to make sure that I'm empowering that. And, and, and helping them fall on and rely on what they have available to them, without me, even needing to be there. 

02:06:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. You know, there's kind of two thinks that, that I was thinking about. One is that, you know, she put it all this work with you already and you already worked together to get this point. And you have, have this solid foundation. You have, have this relationship. And so now you become one of those resources and asset she has to call upon and she did. 

02:07:05
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's right. That's right. 

02:07:05
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON That was interesting. And second thing was, I thought, umm… You know, it was really interesting how uh… again. You were able to kind of see her in the real world now like. You know when you term ended, you wanted to see kind of her play the skills and she's back and she's showing you. And again you can be that mirror like, you're doing this. 

02:07:25
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO You're doing this. That's right. That's right. And then reminding her, hey, you have more… So you have more friends now that you go for. Like, they might be helpful for you as well. And, you know, and so absolutely, yeah, it's, it's, it's a mirror and reflecting back like, you know, you're doing this, you're doing this. And, and, and I think that's important for people to be aware off and to just, you know, to motivate them. 

02:07:45
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Yeah. Yeah. You know, Miguel, I just want to, what to thank you for the work that you've done on this. And, you know, who you are as a counselor, that personal hood, that, that one of you that want to connect with their people both in and out of the session and the humanistic part. You really come through. And the work that you do and even when you're applying some kind of technical skills and you know it comes through that these are really client center, client focused, you know, contacts through related. Uh… Ways of working that are really gonna empower your client to, to get better and change. 

02:08:15
MIGUEL E. GALLARDO That's, that's the goal. That's the goal. I appreciate the time and been able to talk about it… 

02:08:15
MATT ENGLAR-CARLSON Great. Thank you.
