00:00:30
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN So, as I said, below a hand, I had to go, we got called away on an emergency. So this year's Ericksonian Hypnosis, a clinical demonstration and the description is, this demonstration will illustrate the way that ambiguous open-ended suggestion can facilitate a subject's unconscious search and access inner resources. That's the course description. The objectives are to describe the manner in which hypnotic conversation frames formal trance induction. The second objective is to identify three ways in which conscious conversation opens unconscious possibilities. 

00:01:30
[sil.] 

00:01:35
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN So, I don't yet see my subject. I'm gonna, do you want me to go up on stage? Well, right, yes, okay. The, I have a deck of volunteers, thank you. So the umm… the purpose of, of this hour is to use umm…, to use the time to illustrate the process of hypnosis and Ericksonian approaches from my perspective. I do want to say that, that each Ericksonian that each successful Ericksonian or each true Ericksonian has their own style and so umm… Jeffrey Zeiger(ph) Steve Gilligan(ph) or one of the other umm… people who identify themselves as Ericksonian. They are going to be doing a little bit different or sometimes even greatly different than I do it. Umm… the concept is to find your that resonates within you and to pursue your own strengths and your own styles. There are some commonalities that all Ericksonian uh… clinicians adhere to and one of the commonalities is the use of hypnosis whether that's formal or informal umm… because it can be either one and another way, umm… my volunteer showed up. You may come up here. 

00:03:15
[sil.] 

00:03:20
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN The umm… so it's trusting your own unconscious resources. It's using hypnosis to umm… yes, yes my volunteer has showed up and he's… Umm… using hypnosis to access the unconscious mind and that hypnosis can be a formal trance induction or it can be any informal trance induction and it's, it's the well educated clinician who knows hypnosis will be able to recognize informal trance induction. If you study my dad's videotapes and if you study his works, you will begin to get a good understanding of what trance is and how he was capable of doing deep formal trances that took, welcome. That took an interval of time and he also used brief informal trances. Thank you. Mr. Ardagon Welcome. 

00:04:30
ARDAGON Yeah. 

00:04:30
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Have a seat right here on this chair. 

00:04:30
ARDAGON Okay. 

00:04:35
[sil.] 

00:04:40
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN And so my particular style is to listen to the subject, focusing on what the intent of the session will be and then use a formal hypnotic state not always formal, sometimes I use very informal that I think today will be a little bit more formal and then offer the subject hypnotic suggestion and umm… the and I use a technique that I call casting a wide net. So I'm going to listen to what a subject brings as to what he considers to be his personal needs or desires and then umm… and then once he's in a hypnotic state, it is my intention to give him suggestions that will help him to umm… rearrange his unconscious thinking and advance in the direction towards health and well-being. I believe that, I believe there is an unconscious drive towards health and well-being, so there is a natural tendency that people have of umm… moving in the direction of health and well-being and all I'm seeking to do is to stimulate that unconscious drive, I'm seeking to stimulate the hope that resides within a subject and to trust the unconscious mind to explore the internal resources and, and promote some movement in the direction of health. And so I spoke very briefly to umm… Mr. Ardagon(ph) a MD, so you should be doctor Ardagon. 

00:06:40
ARDAGON I am. 

00:06:40
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Umm… at the elevator he, he had purchased a book and wanted umm… wanted me to autograph it and umm… and I asked him if he would be willing to be my volunteer subject and he very reluctantly umm… agreed. Umm… I promised him that I would do my best to ensure that you are comfortable and relaxed and I also promised that you won't have to talk too much. So Dr. Ardagon is from Turkey and he speaks with a very charming accent. Umm… but he assures me that he understands every word that I say and so what we are going to do is first I want to thank you for, for agreeing to sit before this crowd. 

00:07:40
ARDAGON I thank you very much. It's my pleasure. 

00:07:40
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay. And I would like to know if there is something specific that you would like to work on, some sort of a problem or concern? You don't have to tell me what it is, I'm just wondering whether that you have something in mind that you would like to work on? 

00:08:00
ARDAGON Yes, we can, we can so perhaps. I wanted to, too much thing at the same time. Just… 

00:08:10
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay, so you, so you have a tendency to want to do… 

00:08:15
ARDAGON Yeah. 

00:08:15
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Many things at the same time. 

00:08:20
ARDAGON Just cope with many things. 

00:08:20
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay. 

00:08:20
ARDAGON And if something is just traffic, just the traffic jams. 

00:08:25
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Traffic jams. 

00:08:25
ARDAGON Yeah. 

00:08:30
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay. Okay so I'm just going to, I must not little amount when I have a chair. So okay. I would, I would like. Thank you. I would like to ask the audience, if you have a cell phone, if you will just click it into the vibrator mode or turn it off altogether. And umm… 

00:08:55
ARDAGON okay. 

00:08:55
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay. So where what, he has said is that he wants to do many things at, at the same time. He gets all these conflicting desires from movements and, and end up with traffic jams. 

00:09:10
ARDAGON Yeah. 

00:09:15
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN And so tell me, have you had trance experiences before? 

00:09:20
ARDAGON Yes. 

00:09:20
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Do you umm… can you tell me a little bit of how, of what those experiences have been? 

00:09:30
ARDAGON I did trust their's this… my unconscious proved just has resistance to conscious mind. And then umm… 

00:09:50
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Do you pra, do you practice self-hypnosis or is this a matter of, of your working with subjects? 

00:10:00
ARDAGON I work with another friends. 

00:10:00
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN You work with, with subjects. 

00:10:05
ARDAGON Work with subjects. 

00:10:05
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay. When you work with subjects, do you go into a trance yourself? 

00:10:10
ARDAGON Of course, yeah. 

00:10:10
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Of course. 

00:10:10
ARDAGON When I'm just hypnotized by, by somebody else, I just, I think I can go to the trance. 

00:10:20
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN So you can go into deep trance. 

00:10:25
ARDAGON No, but when I, when I, when I go into trance by, by somebody okay but uh… I usually go to trance when I hypnotize, try to hypnotize somebody else. It's no problem. 

00:10:40
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay. 

00:10:40
ARDAGON But if the matter is, if the matter is me, it's just, that it just, there was a big resistance. 

00:10:50
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay. So, so when you are working with someone else, you are able to find your way into a trance state, sometimes a deep trance state but as a subject, it's less easy for you to get into that hypnotic state. Did I understand that? 

00:11:10
ARDAGON Yes, perfectly, yeah. 

00:11:10
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay, all right. So I think that there is probably several things that we can work on at the same time and perhaps this time, there won't be a traffic jam. That the lanes of traffic will begin to flow each smoothly in its own way. Sound alright? 

00:11:35
ARDAGON I believe so. 

00:11:40
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay. 

00:11:40
ARDAGON Because I've been in safe hands of you. 

00:11:45
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN All right, so we're, so we're both aiming with a green light, ready to go in the same direction. Sounds good. 

00:11:55
ARDAGON Thank you. 

00:11:55
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN So do you have a preferred induction technique to put yourself into a trance or, or do you use a lot of try this and try that? 

00:12:10
ARDAGON I use induction techniques. 

00:12:15
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Uh-huh, what's your favorite? 

00:12:20
ARDAGON Induction. It depends on the person. It depends that this must be going. 

00:12:30
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay. Umm… can you tell me one induction technique that you use? 

00:12:35
[sil.] 

00:12:50
ARDAGON I have also excellent induction techniques but I don't, they are no. 

00:12:55
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN All right. It doesn't matter. Let's let that some of that side information just rest over the side of the road. We really don't need that information. So I'm going to invite you now to make yourself very comfortable in the chair. With your feet flat on the floor as they are and just settle into the chair, find yourself very comfortable and relaxed and I'm going to talk to you for about half an hour. Is that all right? 

00:13:30
ARDAGON Yeah. 

00:13:35
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN And you can listen to the words that I'm saying but let your mind wander wherever it chooses to go and if you notice that your retention is drifting off in some other direction, just let your mind drift wherever it chooses to go and trust your unconscious mind to listen to the words and images that are important to you in healing and healthy in their own way and that's all you need to do is just sit back and take a deep breath and trust that your unconscious mind is here listening and ready to pick up the information that it needs to help you move along where you need to go. All right. 

00:14:45
ARDAGON All right. 

00:14:50
[sil.] 

00:14:55
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN So you can sit there with your eyes open, look at me or you can close your eyes if you choose and you can begin to wonder and be curious about when and how and how long you will take before you begin to recognize that something is a little different in the way that traffic flows. Now, I know that you came a very long way to attend this conference and the fact that you traveled such a long way tells me that you have a high level of interest and ability to focus a sustained interest and that you take a lot of care to assure that you gather the information that you need for your work so that you can bring back new information with you to return to your practice. And I'm wondering now as you let your attention turn inward. When it will be that you first begin to notice that some things seems a little bit different in those travels. And I'm wondering how that will express itself to you and I'm asking you now and I'm not asking you to answer me. I'm asking you to ponder the question of what words will come to you, what images, what pictures, what ideas are going to speak to you from the inside out and what language will be used to communicate within you that you have learnt, how to manage the traffic and continue to learn and once you begin to hear those expressions of change for the very first time, I wonder how you will respond. Whether you will put it to words and if you put it to words what language those words will be in. Whether you will hear voices speaking to you, my voice. No ones voice, I wonder whether you will see the congress, the scenes of the desert. The scenes from the journey you made to arrive here or whether you will see the changes in the day-to-day work that you do back home and as you begin to get curious about those possibilities, just let your attention drift wherever it chooses to go, listening or not listening, paying attention or not paying attention. Just accepting what flows before you and following it along and turning your attention to whatever strikes your fancy. And as you follow along that trail of ideas, footstep after footstep, moving forward, one step following another along the path, along a trail. Let your mind drift now to a time when you felt fully gratified whole complete, energized with the activities around you, moving along feeling the movement within your body, within your recollection of what the movement feels like, information you already know of where your feet are and how to move forward and take another footstep forward, one step after another. One step at a time balancing you, feeling the movement, leaning forward, keeping your center of gravity, one step at a time. And as your attention drifts to the feeling in your feet and the feel of the ground beneath your feet supporting you and the movement that you know so completely from the inside out, the connections of your bones, your joints, your legs to your hips, to your back to your body, the way your circulation responds to the movement and let your attention drift inward to the physiology of your own body and notice your breathing now. 

00:22:15
[sil.] 

00:22:20
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN And as you move forward walking along at a steady pace, comfortable pace, a pace that's right for you notice that your heartbeats a steady rhythm and your breath circulates oxygen within you and your unconscious mind knows how to regulate the rhythm in the speed without you having to make any decisions at all. Just notice and appreciate the wisdom so strong within you, the wisdom of a lifetime, wisdom that comes natural and feel that gentle steady rhythm. 

00:23:40
[sil.] 

00:23:45
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN And in your imagination, imagine picking up the pace just a little bit, moving forward faster and the trust that you have on your body, on your unconscious mind to know how to pick up the pace from the inside out and to keep you moving on a steady gentle path, a little bit faster. 

00:24:30
[sil.] 

00:24:35
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Feel that rhythm a little bit faster, exuberating, pleasing yet still comfortable, etched in your memory, belonging to you, knowledge that you have gained and earned through your lifetime and notice now that you can think about slowing your pace down just a little slow it down and notice the way your body already knows how to slow down and match the movement in healthy, invigorating way. The choice is yours to speed up or slow down your body knows. Your body responds while you make your choices. And as you find pace of movement moving forward, moving along on the journey of now, the journey that brought you here to Phoenix, the journey that will take you on home, notice that as you move along in that imaginary journey that's real and here now that there are interesting things moving along opportunities, commitments, choices, distractions, moving along at their own pace. Some moving along in a parallel length right alongside you some traffic coming in another directions. And in your mind's eye, in your imagination look at those images, interesting opportunities, choices, possibilities, places to put your energy, places to spend your time and notice the feeling inside yourself, a sense of tension and excitement and joy, disappointment, confusion all rolled up in one and just notice that sensation within you as you look out and let that image speak to you now in its own way, in its own voice, in its own words, let it speak to you about finding the path of perfect harmony, a rhythm right for you, a rhythm of working within your own capacity, of bringing forth your own special internal talents, of the possibilities of what you can do and what you can do well. And let that sense of accepting choices speak to you with the sense of firm comfort. We all make choices, we all have things we'd love to do. We all find peace with doing the best that we can do, with the resources we have and feel that for a moment. Find peace with doing the best we can, with the resources within us. The best we can with the resources that identify us as an individual, as a human, as a person with strengths and vulnerabilities, as a person with talents and skills, as a person with education and preparation and specialized knowledge. A person who has had unique extraordinary opportunities and had the wisdom to take advantage of opportunities to enhance learning. And let that awareness surround you and permeate you and bath you with refreshing light and the lightness, a lifting of a burden, a feeling of energy and strength coming from within. Feel that strength growing in its own way at its own pace and let your conscious mind and your unconscious mind absorb that strength now. 

00:32:20
[sil.] 

00:32:25
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN And as you feel that feeling, let it speak to you in its own words, in its own ways about making choices and as you look around in your imagination to all the traffic that had been coming across wise to all the traffic jams and congestion and roads leading here and leading there, apart from each other intersecting and leading away, occupying the street. Let that image speak to you in pictures and sounds and colors, in feelings, in connections within you and let that image define itself to you in an unexpected way. Follow up in the distance, looking out ahead. It can be hard to know even what direction you're facing. Scan the horizon, look around. Which way are you going? Get your bearings. Look forward, look back, look to your hopes, look to your dreams, look to your strengths and look to your unique ability to connect in a way that few others have the ability to connect. You know yourself, you know your body from the inside out. You know your strengths and your vulnerabilities. You know your fears and your abilities, your desire and your courage and take all that information in, invite it in, fearlessly honestly, openly to yourself and as you invite it in all of those parts, all of those elements, let your hopes, let your dreams speak the loudest. Let them direct you as to the possibilities of your greatest contribution. Let that nourish you beginning now. Feel the energy that it produces. Feel the joy and the happiness and the satisfaction that accompanies your deepest hopes. 

00:37:05
[sil.] 

00:37:10
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN And let that image nourish you day by day and make itself visible to you through your work, feel the satisfaction of the good work that you have done, or doing, will do continue to do step by step every step of the way. Tune in to the nourishment, tune in to the feeling of reward. Tune in to the joy and let it grow within you, greater and stronger, more vibrant step by step moving forward, telling you where the path is, the path you choose, the direction you want to move in. And let that path express itself and speak for itself clear, louder, more salience, with fragrance and a sense of satisfaction growing, growing, growing now. Begun way back when has been now within you and now lights the path of meaning and hope. And in your mind's eye, in your imagination, look forward to your greatest strength, look forward to your greatest hope, look forward to the clarity that illuminates the path and notice now that all those side lens, all that traffic on the side streets fades in importance. Still there you can hear it. Still there you can see it, if you choose, still there you can hear others talking about it. And yet deeper in you feel that inner compass guiding you to your home wherever your home maybe. At home within yourself, at home within your work, at home halfway around the world with a sense of purpose, a sense of direction, a sense of certainty, well earned that belongs to you. Certainty that carries promise and energy and invigorates you and tells you in no uncertainty that you know what you need to know, what you want to know about doing the best that you possibly can and finding satisfaction in those effort, finding joy, finding rewards, finding promise and finding the energy, being renewed each step of the way, each step on the path along the way as you move forward. 

00:42:20
[sil.] 

00:42:30
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN And as you pause now on that path, get your bearings and look around, look forward, look back, look at what caused you, look at what speaks to you, look at the hope radiating energy, a gift to you. And in your mind's eye see the direction of that path even as you hear the destructions around you. Hear the words, the voices, the voices within, the songs within, the music within and the birds singing that tell you of happiness and tell you of satisfaction and tell you of certainty that you're on the right path. Look forward, look back, feel the reward, feel the smile on your own face, enjoy that feeling, soak it up and let it speak to you now. 

00:44:25
[sil.] 

00:44:35
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Imagine pause, and begin to alert, begin to reconnect with your body, with the energy with the muscles. Scan your body once again, feel your skeleton, your bones, your muscles, feel the support of the arm, chair you're sitting in, feel the comfort of this chair. And notice the way that the chair supports you symmetrically and strongly and let your energy fluctuate within you. Tune into that and notice it. An arousal and a rust, pause, comfort, noticing energy around you. Noticing the energy in the room. Noticing how the energy changes when you take a deep breath. And notice how the oxygen that comes in to you when you breath deeply stimulates your muscles from the inside out and begin to reconnect to your body now in an ordinary way on an ordinary day in an extraordinary moment and feel your body from the outside, feel your body from the inside. Notice where you are. Tune into my voice and to the room and take a deep breath and when you're ready fully ready and not until you are ready, open your eyes taking all the time that you need. 

00:47:05
[sil.] 

00:47:10
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Connect now to me and notice where we are. 

00:47:15
[sil.] 

00:47:20
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay. You know, I would like to ask you just a question or two, are you doing all right? 

00:47:30
ARDAGON Yeah, I am. 

00:47:30
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Do you feel comfortable? 

00:47:30
ARDAGON Of course, yeah. 

00:47:35
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN You relaxed? 

00:47:35
ARDAGON Hmm-mm. 

00:47:35
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN I promised you that I would keep you comfortable and relaxed even as you feel a growth of energy happening within you, a little spark that will continue to grow and continue to grow and continue to grow and guide you as you find your way along your journey and as you find your way looking back from the future to now and thinking about the problem that had come to mind just as you sat down that sense of conflict and confusion and in the weeks to come looking back to that feeling, be curious about how it changes and how it speaks to you and as it speaks to you I'd like you to speak to me and to write to me and to tell me what you know noticed and I will also like you to be completely honest in your observations whether you noticed anything or not. It maybe that you discovered that what you thought was a problem wasn't much of a problem. It maybe that you discover a lot of uncertainty and it maybe that you know in no uncertain terms that a change has taken place. I don't know and you don't know either. As we are looking forward to looking back. But that's what I ask of you. My conscious mind is asking you to let me know at a later date in time. And I am going to turn to the audience now just for a moment and give a few comments and I would like you to just relax and make yourself comfortable. The way I work is to attend to the subject in the best way that I can and to using symbols and ideas and broad open imagery, offer him ideas and messages to his unconscious mind that I trust will bring him wisdom that he already holds within him and that it will his perspective on the problem will realign and redefine itself in a healthy way. That's what my intent is. That's how I work. Now from the audience, I am requesting all of you to please respect that he's a state of work and adjustment for now. So I request that the audience does not trouble him with intrusive questions or even ordinary questions about his experience. I give him now the opportunity to speak and to say whatever he chooses to say and he will be in touch with me and I will post his feedback on my website and so if you want, if you have questions about this trance, if you have questions about the follow up, contact me and, and look on my website and if there is feedback to be heard, I will post it there. And the, so my website is Erickson-klein.org. And so with that I turn back to you. Is there anything that you choose to say to this group, to the audience. You are not required to say anything but if you choose to say, the floor is for you right now. 

00:52:45
ARDAGON To my unconscious first just, prepare some fire balls, as energy. 

00:53:00
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN So your unconscious found some fire balls of energy is that… 

00:53:00
ARDAGON Just my, my inside. 

00:53:05
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay. 

00:53:10
ARDAGON Just, it's, according to its preference. 

00:53:10
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay. 

00:53:15
ARDAGON It's going down in the way which one, which activity or which wave maybe which way must be active. 

00:53:25
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay. 

00:53:25
ARDAGON And then it would go its way. The timing and the starting to activities just under control in my unconscious world now. 

00:53:35
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN That is beautiful. 

00:53:40
ARDAGON Yeah. 

00:53:40
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN So is the microphone working long enough that you all can hear. So, so he spoke of fire balls, an image of fire balls within him rolling forward and finding on speed in their own way. 

00:53:55
ARDAGON Yeah. 

00:53:55
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Directing him from within. 

00:53:55
ARDAGON Because my conscious mind just is, just confusing everything. 

00:54:00
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Conscious mind confusing everything. 

00:54:05
ARDAGON And just make pressing my, my activities just to be come to life or to get sparkling energy. 

00:54:15
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay. 

00:54:15
ARDAGON Yes, I found this thank you very much. 

00:54:15
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Well, thank, thank you, thank you very much. I appreciate. 

00:54:20
ARDAGON Thank you very much. Yeah. 

00:54:25
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN He was a very good subject, I felt very privileged to have found him by the elevator. And, and with a slightly reluctance he agreed, he agreed to come. So umm… is there, I think we have about umm… five or six minutes remaining and I would like to open the floor to the audience if you have questions of me as to my work, I will be happy to answer questions at this time. Yeah and do we have another microphone. 

00:55:10
UNKNOWN Oh, I'm really louder than microphone. 

00:55:15
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Okay. 

00:55:15
UNKNOWN So, so that this way the question I have been asking offered you, why? you know, casting a wide net. 

00:55:20
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Yes. 

00:55:20
UNKNOWN How can we get the images or the values that concepts actually work with some one? 

00:55:30
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Umm… all right, so the question is that I cast a wide net but where do I come up with these ideas and images. Umm… the part of that is trusting your own unconscious mind and going into trance oneself. So when I begin to work with a subject, I focus in really intensely on what, how the subject describes the problem, what, what is the destination, where we are going here and when he sat down, he, he gave a word picture that was very explicit symbolically about umm… what was concerning him at the moment and so I listen to that word picture and took it in myself to my own unconscious mind and let my unconscious mind guide me with where to go from there and that's, that's, it, it's I don't know how to be more specific than that, now there are other ways of coming up with the imagery and, and one of the ways to do it is to, is to tune in to general ideas, you know, in general notice what other people are using and notice. So you can come up with a repertoire that sometimes are referred to as master keys. So if I was, if I was at a total loss and couldn't come up with an imagery, then I could, you know fall back on one of these master keys that, you know, that I hypothetically have in my pocket which umm… I've, I've gotten enough confidence that I'll you know that my unconscious mind will speak to me in a meaningful imagery, you know, I've done enough, you know uh… confidence in my own competence that now I don't carry around the master keys but, but as I was beginning, I did. So we, we have two questions, three questions, so. 

00:57:50
UNKNOWN I thought that was beautifully done and I'm so glad you're here. 

00:57:55
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Oh, thank you. 

00:57:55
UNKNOWN So, so at the end and I caught how he gave you the images and you, you believe them throughout the metaphors, but then at the end, when you merged, I'm just gonna ask this question about this, was that intentional post hypnotic suggestions that generally to do it. 

00:58:10
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN So one of the things that I was illustrating here and this is, this is my style is when I begin to listen to my subject, you know, whether it's in my clinical office or whether it's here as a demonstration, I begin with what's called hypnotic conversation. Okay, so I'm inviting the subject to go into a naturalistic trance before the trance actually begins and at that time, I'm inviting my own unconscious mind to begin to create images and then when I realert the subject, I sandwich it with another layer of, of uh… hypnotic conversation which I find is an effective way to enhance the post hypnotic suggestion. So you give your post hypnotic suggestions in the trance state and then you reinforce the post hypnotic suggestions in the hypnotic conversation. I'm a big believer in a combination of conscious and unconscious working in harmony. My father did not always do that. Many, many times, he worked strictly in the unconscious and never umm… you know felt or compelled to cover the same base consciously. But that's how I work. My style is to, is to cover the base consciously and unconsciously if that's how it works out. That's my default. Okay, in the back. 

00:59:55
UNKNOWN I'm curious about what guides you in terms of the time frame? 

01:00:00
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN You didn't see me looking at my watch? 

01:00:05
UNKNOWN Or you know, involve in this trance with the client and does it really brings so with kind of diving with that hearings? 

01:00:15
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Umm… well, I was, I took off my watch so that I could see it and I kept looking at it because I, I like particularly for something like this, I want to stay within the time frame that's allotted. Umm… but, but truthfully, optimally, you are just looking at the subject and then the subject is ready to go deeper, you're working with the subject and then the subject is ready to alert you following the subject. So optimally you're going with the, you're just going with the energy of the subject, that's the optimal circumstance. The umm… there, there is a natural rhythm, with my work that I have a, the brief hypnotic conversation at the beginning and then the, and then the deeper part of the trance umm… usually about, usually about umm… 20 minutes is in the deeper part of the trance is, is a rhythm that seems to work well for me. But the whole time my eyes are glued on the subject and I'm taking you know note of his breathing patterns, his, his activity level and the, and when I, you know when I start to pulling him up to alert it was in response to his, that he gave me. That answered your question? 

01:01:40
UNKNOWN Yeah that and I'm also crazy about the love one or (inaudible )… 

01:01:50
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN That's, yes, in the announce my, the part that I was for emphasis and part of that was to, you know, a good part of it was for emphasis. Umm… but also it was to link different parts of the experience together umm… you know, so I was doing two things. I was emphasizing certain concepts, I was linking the, the pre-hypnotic state with the journey down with the, with the deepest level that was going to be achieved with, you know the realert. Umm… and, and part of it is just you know that's what came to mind. Okay. 

01:02:35
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

01:02:40
ROXANNA ERICKSON-KLEIN Umm… so, so an example of a master key would be to umm… walk through a field of flowers and pick a bouquet and have to choose which one is uh… is the most beautiful and to discover that there is beauty on its own. So that would be an example of a master key. You apply that to a problem, to a problem that metaphorically fits with that. Another master key would be to you know look at something from the eyes of eye child and how different it looks from the eyes of an adult, the same circumstances, difference in context, you know, so, so to have, you know, to begin to tune into these kinds of general concepts and then if you're lost, you know don't know what to in a specific trance situation maybe, maybe there is one that seems to really fit, you know, having an experience in a racing, you know, like a blackboard or something like that. Okay, I think it's, we're supposed to end a quarter after and I think it's a quarter after and if people have additional questions, I have a conversation now are coming up of shortly, I'll be happy to address any, any other personal or, or umm… you know, things about the family in my own techniques in the conversation hour which is coming up next. So… 

01:04:10
ARDAGON Thank you very much.
