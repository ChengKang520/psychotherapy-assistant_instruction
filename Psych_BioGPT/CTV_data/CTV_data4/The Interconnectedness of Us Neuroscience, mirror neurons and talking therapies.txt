DR. PIETER ROSSOUW Good morning. My name is Pieter Rossouw. I work in Brisbane at the University of Queensland. I'm the Director of the Master of Counseling program at the University of Queensland. And I am very honored to be here today and to share some thoughts about some of the new changes that's happening in neuroscience and how that informs our therapy in general, especially the role of talking therapies. There are some significant changes that's been happening of late as a result of the role of neuroscience to the extent that we've changed the curriculum of the training of counselors, much more from a brain based perspective and apply this on various therapeutic models. So it's quite an exciting time and there's some interesting research happening in this regard. So my interest has been in applied neuroscience for probably 25 plus years. I remember in the early nineties one of my good friends who is a nuclear oncologist had some breakfast one morning. And he said to me I just bought myself a new PET scanner. And we discussed the new resolutions of his PET scanner and I said to him I would like you to scan the brains of my clients. And he said well, do they have cancer? And I said, No, not as far as I know, but we do believe there are some changes that happen in the brain when we talk to them. And I remember the first PET scans we did he said to me, so what are we looking for? And I said to him, I have no idea, but it's very nice pictures. And so we were looking at these pictures and I said to him, we probably need to look at the amygdala activation and look at the limbic areas, what kind of changes do we see in brain. And from there on things became much more sophisticated. There are a lot of very, very new interesting developments happening in this regard. Just one of my Ph.D.'s is doing 120 FMRIs at the moment. And we look at all sorts of changes in treating panic disorder and what kind changes happen in certain areas in the brain. And to jump a huge number of steps, the interesting-, when you look at all of this from a neuro perspective, what we do in therapy is not that clear when you look at the brain from an image perspective. The differences between cognitive therapies and psychoanalysis are not all that different when you look at what goes on in terms of neural activation. So it seems to me that the overlap in counseling approaches, in therapy approaches are much, much, much bigger than we used to think, which means there are other aspects in play as well. And I'll refer to this in our presentation today. So we are experiencing a brand new front here in the understanding of what we do when we work with our clients. And to me that is the key of our entire endeavor. It's not about the neuroscience. It's not about the teaching. It is how can we be effective working with our clients? And how can what we do always be even more effective working with our clients? So the focus that we do have, although it seems like very technical and focusing on all sorts of networks and chemicals and interactions between different neural systems. The premier focus is always how can we enhance wellness for a client? How can we assist the client to facilitate effective change? And that question of how to facilitate effective change prompted me to share this topic with you today as the new focus on the interconnectedness of "us". Neuroscience mirror neurons and all fantastic. Thank you so much. Beautiful. In neuroscience the role of mirror neurons that we'll discuss today and especially what does this mean when we work with our clients, and the role of talking therapies. And hopefully as we'll see in this short time frame that we do have the role of talking therapies have significantly shifted in the last probably four or five, six years. The old concept of talking therapies, counseling and our therapeutic work as an allied health service is shifting significantly into a mainstream focus due to new advances in the role of medication, questions about the efficacy of medication, the new research on the role of, for example, SSRIs. If we do have time I'll share with you some of the latest research on SSRIs that suddenly raises a lot of questions and a lot of concerns which was not around two years ago. These studies were only published last year. So we'll refer to some of this. This so called decade of the brain you'll remember in the early nineties, the then President Ronald Reagan announced that the next ten years will be the Decade of the Brain. And the U.S. pumped in a few billion dollars to enhance research in understanding the brain. And that Decade of the Brain has come and gone. Through that period of the Decade of the Brain fascinating new research opened up an enormous amount of new information, how the brain operates and it actually shifted our entire paradigm of how we understand how the brain operates. For us it's not just a matter of interest. It is of vital importance because how the brain operates forms the basis of what we do when we work with clients in therapy. We need to have some understanding of what's going on up here in order to facilitate change. And even more critically, and we don't have time to do this today, is understand the concept of what the heck is this thing that we call memory. It's amazing how we constantly talk about memory but if you do the section of the brain, and you look at the various parts of the brain you ask yourself where the heck is memory sitting? If you identify certain synapses and connections and neural areas and neural cluster and cortical areas and limbic areas, where's the memory sitting? And that in itself is a big, big topic that we need much more time. I'm running a two day workshop just on how memory operates. And so for 12 hours we talk about just memory systems at last week at Royal Brisbane. Next week I'm running a workshop on memory systems in Sydney. So we need much more time to explore what memory is. The good news is, I'm just jumping to some outcomes, the code for exactly what memory is on a neuromolecular level has been cracked. And it's been cracked by a person called Erik Kandel. And he won the Nobel Prize for understanding memory. And he did this, believe it or not, with sea slugs. And working with sea slugs opened up our understanding of mental illness. He changed the entire paradigm of how we treat mental illness by working with sea slugs. So I'll refer to this mastery in the field a bit later on. The Decade of the Brain as I said has come and gone, which means we are now in the post era of the Decade of the Brain. We are now in the phase where we start to apply a lot of these new discoveries into hard core practice. Ask ourselves, what does this mean working with Client A, working with Client B? How can we utilize some of our brain based knowledge to maximize the therapeutic model that you operate in and to enhance the outcomes for clients. The master in the field, probably on all levels, Erik Kandel, he as I said re-, and rightly so, received a Nobel Prize for changing the entire paradigm of understanding how the brain operates. And I'll talk about this in the next slide. And then there are other masters like Joseph le Doux, Wayne Drevets who did fascinating work at the National Institute of Mental Health. Bessel van der Kolk at Harvard working with Judith Herman. The amazing work of Dunst Ongar published last year on networks of the brain. Trust me, it was painful for me to work through that document, the book, Networks of the Brain. You need at least a masters in Applied Math to understand this. It's all computer networking and it's really, really tough stuff to work through, but masterfully done. Then the amazing work of Mike Merzenich, the guy who developed the cochlear implants. He's the guy who developed the latest principle in neuroscience that built on earlier principles demonstrating that neurons, you know the old saying? Neurons that fire together, wire together. The Hebbian Principle that was discovered in the 1950's and all plasticity, everything built on that principle of neurons that link toger4ether continue to fire together. That's the problem why we get well and we stay well or we get trapped in pathology and we remain in pathology because of that same principle. Neurons that fire together wire together. So they stick together and we get trapped in our systems. That's the reason why our clients get comfortable with their discomfort. They get trapped in their systems. But Mike Merzenich demonstrated that neurons that fire apart eventually wire apart, massive new principle demonstrating that neurons can change direction. Use the concept of plasticity in a new direction. Make a mental note. Within a year or two he'll be the next recipient of the Nobel Prize.

DR. PIETER ROSSOUW Yes. This is on there. Should be them. Now the brain as a neural network is the new direction that we'll all talk, and I share with you a few ideas. The work of Erik Kandel demonstrating that the brain operates in a different section. Now in order to understand some of this, let's do a little bit of a historical tour. And I will be very mindful of my time. I will be finished by 12. But it is a bit tricky for me. My lectures at Uni is always four hours, so I'm used to talking four hours at a time, and I run my workshop for two full days at a time. So I used to talk for 11 hours at a time. So hang in there. It's-, luckily it's just an hour and a half so we'll be done soon. Right. The first bit of information that I would like to share with you just to take you on a tour, because most of us have not necessarily really studied neuroscience for a long time or you may have a little bit of neuroscience in Psych 101. For many, many years the brain has been viewed as an electrical system. That was the very first indicators in early research in the 19th century by people like Ramon Cajal, Camillo Golgi, Emile Waldire (ph), Julius Bernstein. All of them indicated that what happens in these action potentials within one neuron, people tend to refer to two cells talking to each other as an action potential. It's not. It's a synaptic potential. The action potential is the activity that happens in one particular neuron, from the one end to the other, from the dendrite to the axon. Within one neuron there's activity happening and this activity runs because of a change in the electrical current in the membrane. It has a slightly negative charge on the outside of the membrane, a slightly positive charge on the inside. The change in this false information from the one end to the other end. That's called the action potential. So everyone realized, right, the brain runs on electricity. So if the brain runs on electricity how do you treat someone who's unwell? You zap the brain. So for a long time the theory was the brain is an electrical system. Hence, treatment means ECTs. So in order to treat the brain you need to somehow change the electrical current. We have still no idea what happens. And I've been clinic director of two private hospitals in Sydney, one big Vietnam veteran unit, and it still used to this very day, it's a bit of a waste basket approach. If you've tried everything and everything's failed, what's left? Try ECTs. And the idea is maybe we can just reset the brain and somehow there's a little bit more of an ability to activate. And of course it activates a lot of negative effects due to the fact that bilateral ECTs shock the brain to such an extent that you see some neural changes briefly, not permanently. Briefly there's some change in activation. But it also for some reason, as you know the biggest side effect, memory. People say I can't remember. And it took a very long time to understand what happens, why ECTs has an effect on memory. Once we understood this, realizing it really doesn't really affect long term memory but it affects short term memory, so it's more about deeper memory processing in the hippocampus. And it's the hippocampus being very fragile for these kind of electrical changes that eventually result in these changes. But I need to discontinue my discussion about ECTs. The big benefit of an ECT these days is if you do unilateral ECTs, not bilateral ECTs, or lower magnetic stimulation like transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS, it has a lesser negative effect. Reason for that is it has a lesser negative effect on the role of the hippocampus. Fascinating part of our neural system. I'm running a full day workshop just on the hippocampus because it's such an amazing part of our wellness. If you consider the effects of the brain in terms of the aging brain, it's all about managing our hippocampi. There's a lot we do to compromise our hippocampi. There's a lot we can do to enhance hippocampal functioning. And that's the key for not enhancing the risk of dementias and Alzheimers or increasing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases as a result of not caring well for our hippocampi. Okay. The brain as an electrical system was the prevailing theory for at least 50, 60 years. So, and as I say it's still used to this very day. The focus on neural signaling, the electrical current. The brain runs on electricity. Right. That theory, as it always is with some annoying research that comes up with something new, has changed. And it's changed from the mid-fifties onward by a researcher called Henry Dale, and eventually a master in the field, a person called John Eccles. He used to work in the St. Vincent's Hospital in Sydney, and John Eccles was the very first person to demonstrate that the brain does not run primarily on electricity. The brain runs on chemicals. It changed the entire paradigm of understanding the brain from an electrical theory to a neurochemical theory, or we can even say an electrochemical theory. The electrical theory was not wrong, but it's not totally correct. The role of chemicals came into play. What activates this action potential within one particular neuron is a substance called acetylcholine. That sets the process going. And as boring as it may sound, that was the start of what we refer to as the medical model. Suddenly researchers realized if we want to change the brain, if people are unwell, we just need to work with the chemicals. If we can get the chemicals balanced right, things will change. The old theory was the brain is an electrical system. So we have a group of people who supported this theory. We refer to them as the Sparkies. And there was this other group who then, the newer development demonstrated that the brain runs on chemicals. We call this the Cooks, because they see the brain as a bowl of soup. What you need to do is the chemical balance is not right, the soup doesn't taste nice. So what we need to do is add some chemicals to get the soup to taste better. That's the theory of pathology. People are unwell because they have a chemical imbalance in their brains. And trust me, that theory is well and alive and living right here, right now today where we are. It is slowly changing, but the theory of basically somebody's unwell. The first thing you need to do is get the chemical balance right, make the soup taste better. Send them off to get a script, start taking meds. When you're taking your meds you can come back to see me and we can do a bit of window dressing and help you to get a bit better. But it's allied health work. That's the paradigm, the second paradigm, that was very powerful up till probably the mid-nineties when Erik Kandel shifted the boat and the rocked the boat totally and people, due to the power of the pharmaceutical environment, did not pay a lot of attention. Only in the academic environment did they pay attention to this. We're getting to the changes. So that was the dawn of the medical model with the focus on neurochemicals and much of what we do these days are still very much the victim of this medical model. The role of neurochemicals that drives the entire brain system, the Soup theory. Now from here I'm going to jump to something else and then I'll get back to the new paradigm, the understanding, the brain as a neural network rather than a neurochemical system as the Soup theory. I would like to link into something new that we also need to be mindful of. Before we-, oh that's actually the next slide, that one. Before we get to this, just a few remarks about the current state of plain sums (ph) of the medical model. The medical model was so powerful, especially from the seventies, eighties, mid-nineties, that it basically drove the entire system of how we treat people who are unwell. It's all focused on a neurochemical approach and the role of any form of talking therapy was basically pushed to the side until one particular group became quite powerful. And that's the work of Aaron Beck. And we need to pay a lot of homage to this guy. Whether we like CBT or not, what they did from a cognitive perspective is to align themselves closer with the medical model. And the entire process of the cognitive theories became an adjunct to the medical model and at least it opened the door to realize talking therapies to some extent are important. So the role of Beck was to focus on hard core research, empirical research, to demonstrate the benefit of talking therapies, particularly cognitive therapies. And it became the theory of choice on many levels to the extent that many of you probably, to your frustration sometimes, get bombarded with either you do some interpersonal work or you need to do CBT. Some health insurance company always would say we need CBT work to be done because it became the theory of choice on many, many levels. So a very close alliance between CBT research and the chemical model and a lot of research indicating the benefits of this combination of medication plus CBT is the so-called gold standard or best practice. I've been in this field for 25 years and I still have no clue what the word best practice means. But it's always used to say well, this is what the research tells. That's the gold standard or best practice. And it's as if it's the final word. Everything else falls below this and it's below par. So interesting use of this vernacular. So very close alliance and as a result this became the state of play for a significant period of time until recently where new imaging studies became a little bit more the flavor of the day. We are looking at MRI studies, the size of certain parts of the brain areas. Is there a change in the size, in the density of the connections which may indicate some changes as a result of talking therapies. Then you look at fMRIs, which is more a real time activation of what happens from one system to another. We use PET scans which are much more fun to do. It's a bit more of an invasive procedure. You need to inject a radio isotope, a fluorodioxyglucose that slowly decays in the brain. As it decays it give you an idea of activation of blood flow in the brain. As you know blood is magnetic so you can see the changes when you talk to clients. This is where you start to realize that someone is in the PET scanner and we activate a panic experience and you see the blood flow rushes away from the frontal cortical systems into the limbic areas and the clients say to you, Something's wrong. I can't think straight. And you say, I can see that. Because the ability of the cognitive frontal parts of the brain-. Here's my trusty brain. Here's this part. The blood flow reduces from the frontal part of the brain into the limbic areas of the brain. When blood flow reduces in those areas, increases in these limbic areas, you see that clients become fearful. And it's a protective system. It's a survival system. The survival responses sit in these deep areas in the brain and the more concrete, emotional problem solving areas reside in the outside, the cortical areas of the brain. So when we see a shift in cortical blood flow you can clearly see which parts of the brain become more active. So very helpful systems to get a better idea of what happens in the brain. These days we do diffusion studies. You can actually see where a particular thought pattern kicks in and then where it runs to. So you can follow the path of a pattern. And what is most fascinating is that activation in the brain-, oh I can use this thingy. Here you go. Activation for fear based systems, thought patterns, most of time originate here and then it runs to other parts of the brain, into the motor cortex, into the posterior areas. But it starts in the deeper parts of the brain, which tells us a lot about therapy. It means if your clients is unwell, now I'm jumping right through to the end. We'll get back to this later. If your client is unwell and we start with, Oh, can you explain what happened, and use all sorts of cognitive restructuring, the client just goes, I don't know. And within a session or two they're just gone. And we wonder why? It's because of deeper systems that is not effectively addressed, the need for down regulation, the need for safety, the need for a therapeutic alliance. Those kind of philosophical context and concepts now becomes very clear from a neuroscience perspective, why it is so important to establish this, why it is so critical to have a therapeutic alliance, etcetera. I'll refer more to this in a sec. Which brings me to the last concept that I would like to introduce and then we'll go back to the neural networks concept. That is the discovery of this thing that we call mirror neurons. Most of you are probably aware of the concept of mirror neurons. It's been around for a number of years now. The discovery initially was made in the university in Parma in Italy when Giacomo Rizzolatti and Vittorio Gallese and Fogassi were doing some research on macaque monkeys to see what happens in the motor cortex of a monkey when they reach for various objects. So the motor cortex as you know is action driven. So the theory was if they reach for tools or food, various parts of the motor cortex kick in although it's the same action of the hand because of possible intent. So they tried to identify if intent makes a difference in activating the motor cortex. And whilst doing this one of the researchers, Fogassi, was out of the room. He came back in. They were testing the monkey reaching for peanuts and there was a few peanuts on the table in front of the monkey. And he picked up one of the nuts and ate it. And the pre-motor cortex of the monkey fired. And they thought this is ridiculous. Something must be wrong with the entire system. It's impossible that your motor cortex fire through observation. It's action driven, not observation driven. So they start to replicate the experiment and boom, time and again right next to the area where it fires when the monkey reaches himself, that area fires by observation. And they start to replicate this with other actions, for example hearing, certain visual cues, and the same activity constantly fired. And they realized they've stumbled across a system that is basically the first line of external learning for all of us. And that is the mirror neuron system. Someone like V.S. Ramachandran, the guy who developed the phantom limb treatment through the mirror box, people who experience for example trauma or losing say their right hand, and they experience high distress in the motor cortex of that area that used to regulate and drive the right hand. So they get cramps and pains and distress for a hand that's no longer. So he developed the mirror box looking into a mirror that reflects the left hand into the mirror as if it's the right hand. And it basically tricks the thalmus, the observation center in the brain, to perceive the right hand that's no longer there and activates that part of the brain that's no longer active as a result of not having the right hand. And you can actually remold, change the neural activation in that section in the motor cortex by scratching the left hand and looking through the mirror box. And he eventually uses that the therapist can scratch his left hand while the client is just looking at him and it activates that part of his motor cortex. So massive, massive changes in the brain as a result of rewiring the process. He said, Ramachandran said that mirror neurons, discovery of mirror neurons will probably do for psychotherapy, counseling, psychology what DNA did for biology. It will provide a totally new framework for understanding absolutely everything. I'll give you one more example. Mirror neurons is the way that we learn. And we learn everything from day one, how we talk, how we interact with others, how we share, all of this is activated through mirror neurons. We've seen this with babies. If you clap your hands the baby looks at you and they go boop, boop, boop. Or you make some sounds and they make the same sounds. You smile and the baby smiles. It's all that mirror neuron effect, very, very powerful. So someone like Marco Iacoboni in UCLA, the colleague of Dan Siegal, did a very interesting experiment a few years ago on kids who play violent video games. And kids who are exposed to these violent video games for more than four hours a day in the absence of having a good mirror effect with parental support at home, meaning when there's support at home is not effectively modeled as a helpful, healthy support network, all they get exposed to is this violent video games. And then he exposed this group to a real life situation and all of these kids resolved to violence as the solution to solve the problem. And again he demonstrated how the mirror neuron effect eventually change our behavior. So there is an unhelpful part of the mirror neuron effect, not just a helpful role in mirror neurons. Lastly, one of the latest theories on understanding autism also links into the mirror neuron effect. Autism is linked into another neural system which happens at birth and from birth onwards. And that is a process called neural pruning. Neural pruning is where neurons that connect to other neurons let go of some connections. We need a massive chunk of neural pruning to develop exceptionally strong neural pathways. Otherwise the brain fires at random. And it's that ineffective neural pruning that leads to brains firing at random resulting in sensory overload. So a child who experiences sensory overload needs to protect themselves from sensory overload, so what do they do? They shut down, resulting in the symptoms of autism. Or sometimes the sensory overload becomes so much they need to shout and make noises in order to override the sensory overload. Part of the resolve is, what we need to do is demonstrate through the mirror neuron effect to enhance new effective neuropathways. So a big chunk of what we do at the ADA therapies, etcetera is a process to enhance new effective neural pruning which is a very slow process if you have a not well developed mirror neuron system. So that's part of the understanding of autism these days. Right, so mirror neurons plays a big role and as we'll see soon, you need to consider what does this mean for you being a therapist? When you see clients, what is the effect of you being yourself when you talk to your client? Why is it that sometimes you feel there's just this connections. There's this something, and it's not an age thing. It's not a gender thing. It's just something your clients feel, I can talk to you and I can share with you. It's that mirror neuron effect which means it is an essential part of facilitating a new safety for clients to feel safe enough to down regulate their fear responses and open up new systems to build new effective neuropathways, which we may touch on a bit later. So the mirror neuron effect is part of this social interaction between brains. I'll get back to this in a sec. I'm jumping to something slightly historical and then I'll get back to this. Some of you may know that the young Sigmund Freud in the early 1880's, he was a neural researcher. He started his career exploring what's going on in the brains of crayfish and crabs. So all of his research focused on understanding these neural networks in the brains of crayfish and crabs. The reason for that is microscope just developed at that stage. They discovered that the brain is not just a mass of tissue. It's actually a number of neural connections which means networks. And the young Sigmund Freud in 1884 wrote a very insignificant article indicating that neurons don't touch. And he made the comment, it's in that space between two neurons that the subconsciousness sit. Translating it to today, that's memory. In 1884, Sigmund Freud hinted that connection between two neurons is where the subconsciousness sit. That is what memory is. It took a hundred years for Erik Kandel in 2000 to demonstrate he was exactly right. That is memory. And from there on we start to crack the code for understanding memory.

DR. PIETER ROSSOUW Sure.

00:35:35
DR. PIETER ROSSOUW Oh dear. I might abandon what I was about to say and totally go into what you mentioned because this is a topic by itself, is how memory changes its direction. Because that's what we do in therapy, is help clients to change their memory systems. Memory in the brain is not a film strip. Memory is a consolidation of connections. Those of you who have been to Richard Hill's talk just before, he showed a video of Joseph LeDoux. And Joseph LeDoux made this comment that every time you bring out a memory it changes. Why? Because it's the interplay between a neural network and the environment. And that interplay shifts memory systems. But to change memory long term is not that simple. What I'm discussing with you today immediately activates new synaptic connections. Your brains change because of what we share. But trust me, within an hour after this session is over, a lot of the information that I share with you is gone unless you go out and you make some notes and you read the notes and you keep talking about this and your first client on Monday is the victim of this workshop and you apply the implications. Things change. But we need to reactivate on a regular basis in order to shift memory systems from short term to longer term to more permanent memory systems. That's all part of the role of the hippocampus. That's the reason why we dream. But that's another long discussion, is what is the meaning of dreams? We see much more of how the dreams are vitally important for memory consolidation. But also linking short term information eventually into longer term systems. That's why we have these weird dreams of old information linked into new information. And it's all mixed up in order to form longer term memory systems. How long does it take? It can take up to ten years to form long term memory systems. So it's not as if by tomorrow it's all done and short term memory systems have changed. How do we know this? Those of you who want to treat yourself go and Google and read the history of the client called H.M, Henry Molaison. Now Henry, everyone referred to him as H.M. because that's the client case, Henry had epileptic seizures that removed his-. They did a lobotomy but in the process also removed his hippocampi. And when his hippocampus was removed he lost his short term memory system and from there on it was never retrieved. From that day on his memory was gone but he could remember anything that happened in the past long term, from three, four years onward. Recent information was gone. You would meet Henry, have a lovely conversation with Henry, go out of the room, come back and you meet Henry for the first time again. Short term memory system. Now we understand much more of how memory operates and that links into your question. So it's a little bit more tricky and there's more to it. And we need much more time to explore some of that.

They enjoy having a bath and we learned a lot of who we are through the work of macaque monkeys. These days our research at QBI focuses on stem cell, stem cell memory operations, etcetera. And we all work via-, the only animals that we work with these days in QBI are zebra fish due to the fact that zebra fish do not have a limbic system, which means their experience of pain, etcetera is not the same as we experience pain. It's just a protective mechanism. There's much less ethics involved than working with these amazing primates. Great. There's some pictures of some of the social interactions. Now again, we need more time to explore this but just to give you a bit of a taster of this, years ago the young Sigmund Freud became frustrated with neuroscience because they just couldn't keep up with these ideas. So he abandoned this and he eventually metaphors to understand the brain. The birth of analysis, the rest is history. However he believed that neurosis, which is the disease of the time, neurosis is the result of how the brain organizes itself. So he believed there's something wrong with the neural hardware of the brain that caused a condition like neurosis. That was revolutionary. He even said something more ridiculous. He believed that by talking to someone you can physically change the hardware of the brain. That was even more ridiculous. How can talking inform not just the software of the brain, how we think, how we feel, how we behave, but the physical hardware of the brain. You can reorganize the brain through this. The software is like, it's like the information. But the hardware is how the brain physically wires. You can change that with the wiring of the brain. It took a hundred years to prove this. And then on top of this, a friend of him, a colleague that he met, visited him at some stage and he said to him, I also believe in this talking cure. And I'm doing similar and slightly different experiments with my clients in Switzerland. This guy is called Carl Jung. And Carl Jung said to Freud, I believe that our brains actually talk to each other. We share the subconsciousness called the collected subconsciousness. And Freud said to Jung, Mate, I'm sure he didn't use that word. You are crazy. Stick to the scientific method. Don't try to show how brains interconnect. And Jung was totally obsessed with this and he eventually ended up with the occultism, all sorts of stuff. But Jung was miles ahead of his time, even more than Freud. It took a hundred years to prove what Freud said was correct, and that is the brain can reorganize itself due to our intervention and our talking with them, the role of the environment, enriched environment. It will take another ten or 20 years to show how brains talk to each other. We see the physical expressions of this. We see how brains interact and how my talking to you has an effect on your brain and your wellness. If I'm unwell and you continue to talk to me and there's a strong therapeutic alliance shift my unwellness so your wellness has an effect on my unwellness. But how brains actually interact is a principle in neuroscience that's not demonstrated yet in molecular neuroscience. It will take another ten or 20 years to prove what Jung said was exactly correct. The brain is a social entity. It will die if it sits by itself. We need each other to survive. We need the interplay. So that's part of the role of the social brain.

Brain-based counselling Enriched environments Basic needs Attachment and safety (Allison & Rossouw 2013) Control Safety and neural growth-Bach-Y-Rita (1972) Neuroscience indicates the bottom-up approach (in line with neural principles) which can be complemented by a top-down approach 

00:43:05
DR. PIETER ROSSOUW The question, where is the Ego in the brain? That is, again it's concepts that Freud used, Ego, Superego, the Id, which may link into the-, the Id may link into the more primitive part of the brain, the century areas. The Ego may sit in the limbic activation towards the front and the Superego probably the interplay. But that is theoretical stuff that I-, it's hard to bring those kind of theories into the domain of neuroscience. But what we can say is there are more primitive parts of the brain that activate prior to more regulatory parts of the brain. And that's very important for us. And that's what this slide demonstrates. So on some levels your question is relevant. We know these days that the very first part of the brain that develops is this part, actually up to here. And this very first part of the brain called the reptilian brain is the part of the brain that we share with alligators and sea slugs, not as sophisticated as our, but the same areas. Because this is the part of the brain that regulates our breathing, our heart rate, our sexual activity in order to have our procreation active, etcetera. The basic survival responses all sit in this part of the brain. So we need this part of our brains in order to survive. From three months onwards what McClaine (ph) has demonstrated, the next part of the brain develops which is the higher areas of the brain called the limbic areas up to here and more of this part of the brain, the so-called cerebellum, the small brain. Incidentally you know that 80 percent, eight-zero percent of all the neurons in the brain sit in this small brain. Only 20 percent of all the neurons sit in the rest of the brain. So it's the unique nature of the cells in the cortical part of the brain that makes us who we are. And then the big chunk of the brain, the cortical areas of the brain develops basically after birth. We are born with a fully developed primitive part. We need to be able to breathe for the heart to go. Otherwise we're in big trouble. We are born with a semi-developed limbic areas which means we scan our environment for safety. We develop these early systems very early on, probably in the first ten months. What drives us to be scared, anxious, etcetera. It's those early neural activation. And then we develop much higher syncing patterns from ten months onwards till three. And a lot of pruning happens between three and six years of age. Right. So that's the link between the various parts of the brain, from the primitive to higher order. They're sequential processes in how the brain operates, which again is important for us. I'm just jumping again to seeing your client. We need to make sure your client feels safe before we can do all sorts of therapeutic stuff. Think about a client with trauma. Your client has never seen you. You don't know him from a bar of soap. And you say, Oh, tell me about your trauma. That is a lot. Your client needs to feel, I can trust you. I can share. I feel safe enough and maybe by session two, three, four, we may be able to explore a tiny bit. But we need to build something. Why? Because the brain operates from the bottom up. We suss people out. We need to feel safe. We need to feel I can share. And from that notion of comfort, there's safety of attachment, that's the therapeutic attachment, we can build new networks and we can facilitate it. It's not just a bag of tricks and a manualized process. Oh, this is what you do, Step one, two, three. We need to insure that we don't violate the basic principle of how the brain operates. So for brain based counseling what are some of the implications that at least gives us some hints where we're heading in the future? The theories of people like Epstein, Grawe, Klaus Grawe in the institute in Switzerland, Dave Key (ph) and others demonstrated we are driven by basic human needs. And Klaus Grawe has clearly identified how these basic human needs-, Klaus Grawe 2007, lovely book called "Neuropsychotherapy." He identified how these basic human needs provide the essence of our wellness or what constitutes pathology, unwellness. These basic needs, the very first one, is the need for safety and attachment. When a baby is born they need the environment to protect them and as a result of the limbic parts of the brain, this area here, that's the limbic system over here, just below the corpus callosum, that bundle of 50 million neurons that divides the two half of the brain. The basic activation in these limbic areas which are a few sub areas here, which is the thalamus, the hypothalamus, the hippocampus, the basal ganglia. The-, what else is there? Thalamus, hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, the nucleus succumbants. All of these areas are as a class they're referred to quite often as the limbic system. These areas the brain scans the environment, the-, oh, then the amygdala of course. The amygdala scans the environment from birth every second for potential danger. As soon as there is down regulation, there's soothing, there's control, there's attachment, it stops activating. We can clearly see this with fMRI scans. The activity in the babies' amygdala and as soon as Mom picks her up or there's some caring that's close to her, there's a bit of rocking and they hear the sound of Mom, Boom the amygdala just becomes quiet. So it down regulates. It's not interested in fun, in joy, in pleasure. The only thing is it scans for the stress. You can only listen to what I'm saying because at this very moment your amygdala is calm. If the smoke alarm goes off, within a split second you stop listening to me and you scan the environment. If you hear people screaming outside you totally stop listening. You say, I need to get out. Where's the door? When smoke comes into the room you don't even care who's next to you. You just bolt. It's how our primitive systems operates. It is a protective system. That's the problem with trauma. If we have a good understanding of how these primitive systems operate, then we understand trauma is a protective system. People develop trauma, develop phobias, develop pathology as a very small neural activation to protect themselves. But what we do end up with is a neural activation that loops in these areas. You see the increase in blood flow, the increase in activity in these areas just to the front of the anterior cingulate. And there's less activation to the frontal part of the brain, the thinking part saying, Whoa, it's not that bad. I can calm down. And it's that ability to activate this part of the brain that has the capacity to down regulate this. But when clients are in distress they lose that ability. They operate from impulsive brain mode rather than whole brain mode. What we need to do is develop programs and various strategies to enhance clients to operate from whole brain mode rather than just the impulsive brain. Does it make sense? 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:51:30
DR. PIETER ROSSOUW Right. So the basic needs, the first one is the need for attachment. If we have time I'll give you one more example. Half an hour. Yeah, I can give you an example. For many years, just to give you an example how research can give us a skewed perception. For many years researchers clearly demonstrated the following and that is if babies cry and they experience all sorts of distress, what we need to do is to help babies to learn to self soothe. How do we do this? A process as introduced called controlled crying. Have you heard of controlled crying? Right. I see someone cringe already, me just mentioning this. Controlled crying is process where you just leave the infant by themselves. They cry for a while and eventually they stop crying. It's called self soothing. So then they learn, I'm safe. I'll survive. I don't need to worry, etcetera. And they'll self soothe. It stops. Trust me, this process of controlled crying was still the gold standard until last year. And it's still happening at this very day and age in Queensland and in Australia. As a lot of mental health nurses, etcetera use this as a guide for moms with post natal depression, etcetera to get some respite, some relief because of the distress of dealing with an infant that's not well. Only last year did a colleague of mine at the University in Texas Wendy Middlemiss, one of her other colleagues is visiting me on Tuesday here at DQ. Wendy Middlemiss did a study to just check is this actually correct? And what she did was using a chemical test called saliva cortisol, so saliva cortisol is a lovely test because you can actually use this with people with schizophrenia, with mental disabilities, etcetera. It's just a saliva test. It's a tricky one to administer and you need to be very much on top of your game to do this because of the variables. Cortisol levels go up and down all day. So you need to be very mindful of all of these variables. It's different for males and females, etcetera. so it's tricky. However if all your variables are in place you can get really good results. So she did this saliva cortisol test with these babies prior to the controlled crying exercise. And the theory was the saliva cortisol should skyrocket-, well it should drop when they self soothe because saliva cortisol is the end result. And we don't have time to discuss this. It's the end result of what we refer to as HPA axis. HPA is the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal system, which is three systems, two systems in the limbic areas and a third system on top of the two kidneys. When we are distressed, the amygdala activates the hypothalamus to produce a substance called CRF, corticotrelfen (ph)releasing factor. And CRF flows down to the pituitary gland to activate the production of ACTA, adreno cortico trelfen hormone which then jumps the brain blood barrier, flows down to the adrenal glands sitting on top of the two kidneys. And that's how stress factor is in the body and it produce huge amounts of adrenalin and activates the medulla to produce norepinephrine. And it also produce cortisol. So cortisol is the end result of this stress response. Cortisol's job is to flow back into the brain, jump the brain blood barrier and basically announce to the hypothalamus, You can shut down. I've done my job. The body is in fight or flight mode. So it has the job to down regulate. However, too much happening at the same time leads to an overproduction of cortisol and cortisol causes havoc in the brain. It kills brain cells. It depletes the glial activation between neurons and eventually has a detrimental effect on the hippocampus. It inhibits the production of BDNF, the brain growth factor, which is the building of new neurons. So if we have too much cortisol, too much stress, it inhibits our production of new neurons, resulting in us being much more vulnerable for neurodegenerative diseases etcetera. When we are very young the brain builds 250,000 new neurons per minute per stem cell. When we are over 28 years of age we produce new neurons, roughly about 800 per day. It's not much. And if we somehow compromise our neural system by introducing way too much refined sugars, too much stress, too much alcohol, certain unhelpful chemicals, benzodiazepene, the sleeping tablets that's another issue, we deplete the production of BDNF. But cortisol is the main culprit. So now I'm getting back to Wendy Middlemiss' study, why she uses cortisol, which means if the babies produce too much cortisol they will be in big, big trouble. So we are all hoping controlled crying will drop the cortisol levels. She did the saliva cortisol test after the controlled crying exercise. They all stopped crying and what happened? Boom. All the babies' saliva cortisol went up, significantly up. But they stopped crying. And suddenly we realized what happened is not self soothing exercise. It's the introduced of learned helplessness. Learned helplessness, which means we cry for help. No one answers so what do we do? We stop crying. How many of us see clients that are victims of significant abuse and they don't ask for help. It's learned helplessness. It's a system that eventually kicks in as a result of cortisol overproduction that leads to an inability of the entire neural pathway, the neural patterns to activate effective outcomes. And we fall trap to becoming victims, the victim picture, somehow who portrays this victim role. Right. Yes? 

00:58:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:58:30
DR. PIETER ROSSOUW Isn't that amazing? And it is unfortunately, now I may be wrong I hope I am, but from my experience I might be right. It is further enhanced by the introduction of a chemical called EtOH. EtOH enhanced trapped patterns, neural patterns, alcohol. So if you introduce (inaudible )alcohol, the brain inhibits its production of BDNF. And as a result we get trapped in this loop. So for clients to shift from this we need a safe, enriched environment. This is where programs become so powerful. We need programs that's the role of the enriched environment to be able to support and slowly, slowly shift a new pattern. And every time they go back home, the old pathway kicks in. The old triggers kick in. And they say, Oh, yeah. I just couldn't help myself. I have to heat the grog because it was just too much stress, etcetera. And the pathways unfortunately are reinforced and eventually form some new genome changes. So very significant. Right. The role of attachment of critical. The role of control is the second key basic need. One of the most essential needs for all of us in terms of our survival and then on a higher order, to proliferate, to be well, is we need to experience a sense of safety and control. It's when the neural system experiences safety it down regulates activity in this area, which means there's less activity in the fear response areas. And it enhances activity in the rest of the cortical part of the brain. So the more clients feel safe, the more they can think straight. They can problem solve. They think about new ideas. And you can just see the client just run to wherever we suggest because we have good neural activation. And when clients are in distress they just sit there. And how many times have we had this experience you feel, I wish I could just this client because they just don't get it. They look at us and you can just see there's no one home. It's because of that fear response system. The activity in the cortical part of their brain is totally compromised. That means we need to close down in what we're doing, focus on safety, focus on building that rapport. And through this eventually we'll be able to slowly work towards more effective neural activation. Yes? 

01:01:10
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:01:20
DR. PIETER ROSSOUW That is part of this mirror neuron effect. As I say, the principle is demonstrated but on a neuromolecular level we don't understand this yet. What we do know is when I talk to you, something activates in your brain. And people say, Oh, the pain has dropped or something's happening. We see the activation pattern. How exactly this sensory activation through being in this environment, listening to me, hearing the information, processing the information help you to facilitate new pathways, how this interaction facilitates this exactly we're not sure. But we see the processes happening. Hopefully at some stage we'll be able to see if I am this close to you and I speak at this decibel level it has this effect. If I'm a little bit further it has that effect. If you hear this or if the environment is slightly different how will things change? That's a lot of experimental stuff that we're not clear yet. 

01:02:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:02:25
DR. PIETER ROSSOUW Absolutely. Absolutely.

UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:02:27
DR. PIETER ROSSOUW Absolutely. And that fear response and this is where the American Pediatric Association suggests not more than half an hour of television for babies or for young children under the age of two, half an hour per day. And then the increments is only half an hour up to a maximum of three hours per day. And then on top of this I think we need to be very vigilant on what kind of video games we expose our kids. Even some of these animations are gruesome. So we need to be very mindful on the impact on the limbic system. Right. Hence, just the last arrow there which is the important one. We constantly need to consider our work with our client as a bottom up approach, meaning we need to start with developing these safe systems, the sense of control. What we constantly were told many years ago when we were still doing our training, the therapeutic alliance. Now we see this from a neuroscience perspective. That's the essence of building effective change.

01:04:00
DR. PIETER ROSSOUW Yeah. Part of-, exactly. Part of the neural system of experiencing a sense of a particular action is completed is the release of dopamine from the basal ganglia back to into the amygdala. And that release of dopamine into the basal ganglia down regulates. So as soon as we've done something and we realize I've closed the door, a little bit of dopamine is released and we can move on to the next task. One of the strong theories these days is it's the inactivation of the release of dopamine that leads to repeating a certain task over and over until there's dopamine released so that we can shut down. And clients feel a high level of distress when they don't have that dopamine release. So-, but that's a small window into a much more complex process. We need more time to discuss that one. Sorry. How are we doing with the time? 20 minutes. Good. Erik Kandel wrote an article in 1998 called "A New Intellectual Framework for Psychiatry." That article was the most pivotal article that was written in psychology, psychotherapy, counseling, psychiatry in a hundred years. If ever you read anything, any article on counseling again, it should be this one. In this article he changed the entire paradigm of how we used to focus on counseling and therapy as from a medical perspective and pointing towards the new paradigm. That was 15 years ago. Now we're at the stage where what he hinted toward is clearly demonstrated. In this article he referred to-, well there's a particular subsection in the article that Kandel says we are in the midst of a remarkable scientific revolution, a revolution that is about to change the way we treat mental illness. And, now remember this guy was a molecular neuroscientist. A lot of people said you are putting your academic reputation on a line here and you're hitting a block because as a molecular neuroscientist you can't say these things. He said the following, now remember 1998. He said, when a therapist speaks and a patient listens, the actions of neural machinery in the therapist's brain is having an effect on the client's brain. In so far as our words produce changes in the patient's mind, meaning feelings, thinking, behavior, it is most likely that our words produce changes in the patient's brain. And this is where clinicians said, similar to what Freud said to Jung, you are crazy. It's like saying this laptop here can talk wirelessly to this one over here. But Kandel was not saying this. He's saying much more. He's not saying we are sharing software with each other. He's saying when this laptop links wirelessly with this laptop, that laptop can change the Intel processor of that laptop. And now you go, cannot happen. You need to open this thing up and you need to remove the chip and put in a new chip. You said you can change the Intel processor just by linking remotely. That's how radical his suggestion was. And now we go, okay this is big. Talking can physically change the neural structure of the brain. And this is a new dawn of the new paradigm of understanding the brain. The brain is not just an electrical system. The brain is not just a neurochemical system. The brain is a network of connections. And it's this network of connections that's constantly adjusting itself due to new experiences. The interplay between our genetics and our environment, the study called epigenetics. It's how the environment informs the brain and changes the brain, which means, especially in the first ten months, a huge of brain expression happens and hence the critical experience in the first ten months. And unfortunately we can't do hypnosis and go back and tell-, our clients tell us this is actually how my birth was or this is actually what I remember of.... We may have implicit memory systems but that implicit memory system, as far as we know these days, maybe in 20 years we may be proven wrong. But as far as we know implicit memory systems cannot make explicit in terms of cognitive expression, that you can actually tell, Oh, I can see the light. I can see the doctor. He's actually smiling. He's having the glasses on. Now he has a tear in his eye. He's so happy to see me, etcetera. We don't know. It seems more of memory confabulations than real memory systems. What we do know is it doesn't mean that memory is not a memory system. And hence clients can have a major phobia for small spaces due to birth anoxia. And cognitively they can't remember this but the implicit system is still there. And it's those implicit systems that play a big role. So what we need to do is facilitate a new sense of control, a reframing of their experiences. I survived. I was fine and that reframing changed memory systems. That's why talking, that's why interacting facilitate new neural changes. So Kandel referred to this big, big change as a remarkable scientific revolution, which it certainly is. Yes?

DR. PIETER ROSSOUW Yes of course.

DR. PIETER ROSSOUW Absolutely right. 

01:10:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:10:25
DR. PIETER ROSSOUW Exactly. That's why I say we see the phenomenon. We need to explain this on a neuromolecular level exactly what happens. When I talk to you and this is where the risk of transference and counter transference happen because I have issues and I'm talking to you. And you have issues with your dad and I'm telling you what you need to do because I'm actually working with my issues with my dad while talking to you, trying to reframe my own memory system. So we need to be mindful of these memory systems. Right. So on some levels we are going back to the future. Where we are heading in the future is probably back to what Freud indicated, talking is the cure. Talking facilitates major changes. It seems that talking facilitates more changes than, for example, medication. We need at least four hours to talk about the new research on medication, especially SSRIs. And amazing study if you would like a copy of the study drop me an email and I'll send it to you. It was published last year by a molecular neuroscientist in Canada with a few other colleagues, Andrews and others. So just email me and ask for the Andrews study, 2012. And the title of this study is "Primum Non Nocere." Primum Non Nocere is the words that Hippocrates used and that is the first thing you do when you treat someone? You do not do harm. "Primum Non Nocere" is the title of this study and the subtitle is "Whether Antidepressant Medications do More Harm than Good." And this is not a hypothetical study. This is not just saying, Oh, we all have some issues with pharmaceutical companies. They are bad people, etcetera. It's a neuromolecular study indicating that if you take SSRIs long term you change the morphological structure of those neurons. And when the morphological structure changes the rest of the brain cells notice those morphological changes as foreign bodies and it kills those cells. It's a process called apoptosis. So you end up with long term use of SSRI killing the serotonin producing cells. And as a result of these cells being killed, as soon as you discontinue medication your risk of relapse is massive, not because you need the medication, because of a depletion in the system. And now we, to use the scientific word, we buggered both ends. If you continue the medication if has an effect. If you don't continue this you have a risk of relapse. You see? And there's much more to this. 

01:13:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

01:13:02
DR. PIETER ROSSOUW SNRIs, SSRIs on that level, exactly the same only SNRIs not only activate the inhibition of the reuptake of serotonin, it also focuses on norepinephrine so they have serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. But their study focuses only on SSRIs. But the principle of the five hydroxytryptophan that activates the depletion of the-, or inhibits the reuptake of the serotonin molecule back into the neuron that released it is exactly the same. So we have five hydroxytryptophan SNRIs as well.

DR. PIETER ROSSOUW That's what we hope. In a few years you'll be able to say to your client, Let's see what your baseline at this stage in terms of neural activation. After 10 or 15 sessions say, Let's see how you're brain's progressing? Rather than saying how are you feeling today? Let's do a little checklist. We're going to physically see to what extent our neural firing is increasing, our release of unhelpful neurochemicals, norepinephrine, cortisol is decreasing. So we can have a much better baseline. Right. So what I mentioned earlier the third arrow there. The big overlap between therapeutic approaches seems to be quite significant. There's a big, big overlap. It's much more about who you are, what you do, rather than the details of what we do. What we do know is as long as our theoretical approach at least adheres to the basic principles of neuroscience and not compromise it, the chances of good outcomes are so much better. We don't have time today to actually discuss how neurons build new neural networks. It's fascinating. I could share some footage how neurons search for others in order to build new networks. How neurons change direction and decide I'm going to unfriend someone like Facebook, and make friends with someone else and how neurons build new pathways and new networks. It's fascinating to see that that's the process of what we do and what we refer to (inaudible ) The principle is between us there is a very strong interconnectedness and the interconnectedness between us form the basis of what we do in therapy. It's the environment that informs the brain. We used to think the brain is a substance by itself and now we realize the interplay between the brain and the environment is quite crucial. And it's this constant interplay that molds the brain into who we are. That's why we get traumatized. when we experience distress the brain changes. Why is this? Because the brain learns much, much quicker through pain than it learns through a supportive environment. Why? Because of protection. So the neural systems in the deep centers of the brain kick in much quicker when we're in distress. So for me, I could have considered getting a bucket of ice water next to each of your chairs. And every time I need to explain something difficult, I just say, Just put your hand in the ice water. And you go, Okay, get over. Get done with it. Your learning system increased because of the production of cortisol. So cortisol helps us to learn but it forms what we call closed neural loops. Within 10, 15 minutes some of you would just go, Bugger this. I'm out of here. And you go because you just feel I'm not putting myself through this. You may learn a lot but you're not doing this long term. That's the problem with trauma is the brain learns but it forms closed neural circuits and that's where we get trapped in our memory systems. So to form new memory systems we need to down regulate this. They need to feel safe enough to risk letting go of this protective pattern and try something new. That's a big risk. And clients need to be safe enough so we need to facilitate that very gentle safety for clients to be able to risk taking one step away from what I used to do and try something different, move in a different direction. And that's where being with others, the role of nonverbal cues, the listening, the nodding, the little smile, the not yawning, those kind of things are actually quite helpful for clients to feel, I can relate to this. I feel safe enough. And we form a new safe enriched environment. And it's within this enriched environment that things change. I need to-, do we have time to share one particular bit of information? Seven minutes. There was an amazing study done in Edinburgh a few years ago by Shannon Battersby. They've isolated two particular types of the genome that activates the production of the protein that build serotonin. And they realized that we inherit two variables from each of our parents, a long allele, that's the tip of that genome, and a shorter allele. The long allele has more molecules sitting on top of each other. And the sort allele less molecules. If we inherit two long SE alleles, serotonin alleles, from one of our parents our risk of developing serotonin depletion is very low just because of the long SE alleles. If we inherit the short ones, scientific word kicks in again. We're buggered. We have a very high risk of developing serotonin deficiency. So what they did was they bred a group of macaque monkeys with two short SE alleles, so their risk of serotonin deficiency would be very high. They split the group and they raised the one group in what they call an enriched environment. Happy family monkey environment, family play, interactions. And the other group in a very sterile environment. And that genetic risk never expressed in this group and it only expressed in this group. And for the first time we realized our genes is not the final answer. It's what happens in our environment. To me the, and that's where we're heading, what you do in therapy is you provide a new safe enriched environment. A client with all their crap and all their distress come and see you and when they see you in your room it's that safety that should never be compromised or violated. They need to feel safe enough to share. And it's through this sharing the eventually we facilitate clients' willingness to change their neural patterns and eventually dare to go out and be that different person, change their entire neural activation. That's the shift in memory environments. The entire concept of neural plasticity is so powerful because without neural plasticity there's no point in us doing what we're doing. It's the ability of brains to reorganize, the ability of neural pathways to form new patterns of connection that facilitate the ability for us to develop new ways of being. It's all memory systems and it's all about facilitating new effective shifts in memory systems. The complexity of the human memory system is just too complex to crack the code for memory yet. Hopefully we'll get there one day and to see how complex one particular memory aspect is. And that's the problem with medication. Medication cannot change memory. It can only activate within a system that's already activated. So if we don't have good neural activation, we just enhance activity within that system. Hence, take an SSRI for someone who's highly suicidal. It's a big, big risk. So the role of plasticity is the essence of what we do which brings me to my last slide. Oh, we don't have this active any longer. Probably this one. We are in the phase of the post-decade of the brain but in a very exciting phase asking ourselves how can what we do, the therapeutic work that you do, be enhanced with understanding some of the basic principles. We don't need to be neuroscientists to do what we do. But for our clients to have a very basic understanding of some of these principles would be very, very beneficial. What we're doing at this stage at UQ is we are developing a series of very basic animations to explain to a client what happens in the brain when certain changes happen and for you to use those animations working with your clients. If any of you are interested in some of this work we're piloting the first group of this work and we'll provide some training in this regard as well. Drop me an email.

DR. PIETER ROSSOUW U-Q, the University of Queensland. uq.edu.au. Thank you so much for listening to this and hopefully it activates a few new brain systems and you may feel this is something that I would like to read a bit more or explore a little bit more. But the future in applications are actually so big and there's so many opportunities in this regard. So good luck with your work as well. Thank you.
