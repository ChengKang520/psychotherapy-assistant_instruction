Perhaps your teenage daughter seems withdrawn or maybe your aging father talks about being a burden on everyone. These are all possible signs that a friend or loved one, maybe suffering from depression and thinking about suicide.

The key to prevention is knowing what the warning signs are and what to do to help. 

00:00:50
DR. ALAN BERMAN Hello, I’m Dr. Alan Berman, Executive Director of the American Association of Suicidology. Suicide prevention is very important because we have evidence that life can be saved, the pain can be relieved, and the people at risk for suicide can lead long and productive lives. Many suicides are preventable especially if we join with professionals, as gatekeepers or first finders and help people at risk get into treatment as needed. If we are informed about the warning signs of a depressed or suicidal person in the ways that we can help. Stigma can be reduced, policies and procedures that now may present barriers to getting help can be changed.

00:02:10
What is depression? 

00:02:20
EVA LOWE Depression can be defined as an emotional state in which people have extreme feelings of sadness, dejection, lack of worth and emptiness. Depression is not the blues. The blues are normal feelings that eventually pass, the feeling associated with depression last longer than a few weeks no matter how hard depressed people tried to feel better, they can’t shake their depression. 

00:02:50
DR. ALAN BERMAN Depression can be characterized by five or more of the following symptoms or warning signs. 

00:02:55
a depressed mood; changes in appetite or sleep patterns; loss of enjoyment or pleasure; loss of motivation; loss of energy; feelings of guilt and worthlessness; inability to concentrate; slowing of speech, thought, and body movement; physical agitation and restlessness; recurring thoughts of death or suicide. 

00:02:55
DR. ALAN BERMAN A depressed mood or markedly diminished interest to pleasure in activities for most of the day. Significant changes in appetite or sleep patterns, a loss of enjoyment or pleasure in most activities, a loss of motivation, a loss of energy or persistent lethargy, feelings of guilt and worthlessness and inability to concentrate or indecisiveness, a slowing of speech, thought, and body movement, physical agitation and restlessness and recurring thoughts of death or suicide. 

00:03:35
What causes depression? 

00:03:40
DR. ALAN BERMAN There are many theories about what causes depression. The biological theory stresses that some forms of depression especially those that appear like a black cloud enveloping the person rather than the response to a stressful event such as a loss are due to our biochemistry or to our genes. The psychoanalytic theory now less involved than in the past cease depression as a response to loss and separation. The prevailing psychological theory is cognitive. It stresses that depression results from how we think, the depressed person develop certain negative ways of thinking about him or herself, about others and about the future. These thoughts lead to distortions in thinking such as I’m a failure or I’m worthless from which depressed feelings naturally follow. Another psychological theory, the behavioral theory views depression, a stemming from a lack of positive reinforcement and a low level of skill in getting positive outcomes from others. As a result, depressed persons often feel and act, helpless and hopeless. Two important things to remember about depression are these: First, most depressions can be effectively treated. The best treatment involves a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Second, left untreated depression can be lethal. 

00:05:20
Why would someone choose to die? 

00:05:30
EVA LOWE Often the underlying reason that someone who choose to die is that they are suffering from depression. They are in so much emotional pain that they see suicide as the only relief from their pain. 

00:05:45
DR. ALAN BERMAN Depression is very much associated with suicide. Remember thoughts of suicide are one symptom of depression. Researcher shown that around 60% of all completed(ph) suicides have one or another form of depression and that having a clinical depression, increases the risks for suicide. The lifetime risk for suicide in males diagnosed with depression is about 7%. For females, it is 1%. Depressed people do not choose to be depressed, depression is a mental disorder just as pneumonia, is a physical disorder. Depression is treatable and most important thing to remember about depression is this. When you think a friend or loved one or even you yourself maybe suffering from depression, take action, get help. 

00:06:45
Warning signs of a suicidal person 

00:06:50
EVA LOWE Suicide can be prevented because suicidal people more often than not will try to let someone know that they are thinking about suicide. Often people are unaware of the warning signs of a suicidal person. The warning signs of a suicidal person can be grouped into three categories. 

00:07:10
• Behavioral Signs • Verbal Signs • Situational Signs 

00:07:15
EVA LOWE Behavioral signs, verbal signs and situational signs. A suicidal person may show definite behavioral signs that indicate they're thinking about suicide. Here are some behavioral signs to be aware off. 

00:07:30
• Behavioral Signs Trouble eating or sleeping; Dramatic changes in behavior; Withdrawal from friends and/or social activities; A loss of interest in hobbies, work, school; Giving away prized possession; Previous suicide attempts; Preparing for death by making final arrangements, such as making out a will out of context of where they are in their life; Excessive risk-taking; A loss of interest in personal appearance; Increased use of alcohol or drugs; Preoccupation with death and dying, or talk about suicide; Talk of feeling worthless or showing low self-esteem.

00:08:25
EVA LOWE People who want to end their life may state their desire very directly. They may say, I’m going to kill myself or I don’t want to live anymore. If a person says this, you must take them seriously. Among them more saddle ways in which a person may state verbally that they are suicidal or these words. 

00:08:45
• Verbal Signs “Soon I won’t be hurting so much anymore.” “They will be sorry when I’m gone.” “I wish I had never been born.” “I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up.” “You won’t have to put up with me much longer.” “Do you think dying hurts?” “They would be better off without me.” 

00:08:50
EVA LOWE “Soon I won’t be hurting so much anymore.” “They will be sorry when I’m gone.” “I wish I had never been born.” “I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up.” “You won’t have to put up with me much longer.” “Do you think dying hurts?” “They would be better off without me.” 

00:09:15

00:09:20
EVA LOWE There are various situations that may occur in a person’s life that may put them at risk for suicide. Here are some situational warning signs that make factor into a person wanting to die. 

00:09:35
• Situational Signs Divorce, whether it is the breakup of one’s own marriage or of one’s parents’ marriage; The loss of relationship through death; Substance abuse; The breakup of a boyfriend or girlfriend relationship; Emotional, physical or sexual abuse; The belief one is not wanted by others; Failure at work or school; Sexual identity conflict; Financial setbacks. 

00:09:35
EVA LOWE Divorce, whether it is the breakup of one’s own marriage or of one’s parents’ marriage; the loss of a relationship through death; substance abuse; the breakup of a boyfriend or girlfriend relationship; emotional, physical or sexual abuse; the belief that one is not wanted by others; failure at work or at school; sexual identity conflict; financial setbacks. If you recognize any of the signs that a friend or loved one maybe suicidal. Ask them directly if they are thinking about suicide and talk with them about getting help from a professional. 

00:10:25
Youth at risk for suicide 

00:10:30
EVA LOWE Although people of any age can suffer from depression that is serious enough to lead to suicide, young people are especially at risk. In fact, suicide is the third leading cause of death in young people. Sue Eastgard, Director of Youth Suicide Prevention Services of Washington State will help us understand why young people may choose to die. 

00:10:55
SUE EASTGARD I hear a lot from teens a sort of this phrase that goes you know I hate myself, the world sucks and isn’t going to get any better and except for those three features that make me particularly concerned when kids are at risk of suicide. Many teens I talked with, talk about feeling as though they will never measure up that they are not good enough. They don’t get that feeling within themselves and they don’t get that feeling from their families and they are feeling very alone. There are certainly other kinds of situations of feeling hopeless uhm… related to problems at home, related to feeling trapped in an environment where there is not the kind of support where mom or dad simply aren't unavailable or don’t understand, uhm… don't make time, have their own set of problems. So, many teens are feeling often times responsible that their parents maybe struggling with their own issues of mental illness or issues of drug and alcohol abuse and misuse or maybe simply overwork and feeling frantic trying to support their families with several jobs. And the young people in those situations not at all feeling as though there is someone who cares about them. 

00:12:15
EVA LOWE If you are worried about a young people and you fear they may be contemplating suicide, trust your judgment. There are three things to remember when intervening with the suicidal young person. 

00:12:25
• Show you care • Ask the question • Call for help 

00:12:25
EVA LOWE One, show you care, two, ask the question, are your thinking about suicide? And three, call for help. Let the young person know you care. Listen carefully to what they have to say. 

00:12:40
• Show you care “Tell me about your pain.” “You mean a lot to me, and I want to help.” “I don’t want you to kill yourself.” “I’m on your side…we’ll get through this.” 

00:12:40
EVA LOWE To show you care, you may say “Tell me about your pain.” “You mean a lot to me, and I want to help.” “I don’t want you to kill yourself.” “I’m on your side…we’ll get through this.” It is important for adults to remember not to dismiss the impact of a teen or early adult crisis that may seem trivial by adults standards. Talking with young people about suicide won't put the idea in their heads, ask the question directly. Are you thinking about suicide? Here are some other questions to ask a young person who you think maybe suicidal. 

00:13:20
• Ask the question “Are you thinking of hurting yourself?” “What thoughts or plans do you have?” “Have you thought about how you would do it?” “Do you really want to die? Or do you want your pain to go away?” 

00:13:25
EVA LOWE Are you thinking of hurting yourself?” “What thoughts or plans do you have?” “Have you thought about how you would do it?” “Do you really want to die? Or do you want your pain to go away?” You may be able to help a suicidal young person only to a certain point and then you need to call for help from someone trained in suicide prevention. Here are something you might say to lead a young person to get help. 

00:13:50
• Call for help “Together I know we can figure something out to make you feel better.” “You’re not alone. Let me help you.” “Let’s talk to someone who can help… let’s call the crisis line now.” 

00:13:50
EVA LOWE “Together I know we can figure something out to make you feel better.” “You’re not alone. Let me help you.” “Let’s talk to someone who can help… let’s call the crisis line now.” When calling or going for help on behalf of a suicidal young person, never leave them alone. 

00:14:15
Ages 65 and older at risk for suicide 

00:14:20
EVA LOWE Older persons are particularly at risk for suicide. 

00:14:25
DR. ALAN BERMAN Clinical depressions of which moderate severity have been highly associated with suicide among the elderly. Preventing suicide among the elderly however, requires the recognition of depression and suicidal risk. However, depression in this age group is not easy to diagnose and primary care physicians often do not spend sufficient time with their older patients to evaluate the possible depression. Moreover, the elderly are less likely to seek help for emotional problems than they are for physical complaints. And are less likely to report symptoms of depression. 

00:15:05
EVA LOWE Suicide rates are higher in those 65 years and older than in any other group. The many losses that older people experience, factor into the higher rate of depression in this group. 

00:15:20
DR. ALAN BERMAN There are physical losses such as failing health, bodily changes and terminal illnesses. These physical losses may involve pain and toward cause of person to feel unacceptably dependent or burden to others. The loss of independence or control may make them feel helpless or depressed. Often an elderly person does not share these feelings with their primary care physician and their physician does not take the time to explore in depth and treat an elderly person’s depression. There are other kinds of losses such as a loss of a relationship through death. This may cause an elderly person to feel abandoned, isolated and alone. For such people, feeling of despair may result and depression may follow and they are more at risk for suicide. Suicidal thoughts are not normal consequences of later life. The elderly need to be encouraged to recognize that depressed feelings are not normal and to share all symptoms, physical and emotional with their physician. Sometimes, it is helpful, perhaps even necessary for family member or friend to go with the elderly person to share their concerns. Older people who are depressed, can be helped with medication and supportive counseling. 

00:16:45
How to help a person you think may be suicidal 

00:16:55
DR. ALAN BERMAN If you think a person maybe suicidal, here are some important things that you can do to help. 

00:17:00
Know the warning signs; Don’t ignore, minimize, or moralize. Listen and offer support. Don’t make assumptions. Offer to help. 

00:17:00
DR. ALAN BERMAN First, know the warning signs, observe carefully. Second, don’t ignore, minimize, or moralize. Third, listen and offer support. Fourth, don’t make assumptions, let someone trained to evaluate to their job. And fifth, offer to help the person get help and help them, get help. 

00:17:25
EVA LOWE Everything that has known about suicide that tells us that people who tried to take their own life, really want to find a better way, so the potential for preventing a friend or loved one from committing suicide is actually quite high. If the cry for help is not ignored, it can have a positive effect for bringing about change and for helping a friend or loved one, turn around desperate situation and find the inner strength to walk through it. 

00:17:55
DR. ALAN BERMAN The United States Sergeant General has called suicide, a serious public health problem and has made suicide prevention a national priority. Preventing suicide remains a broad-based partnership among public and private organizations, professionals and the lay public. Premature and tragic death by suicide robs families and friends of loved ones leaving deep wounds in those who care. Most importantly, many of those who are suicidal can be helped and need not end their lives as a way of ending their pain. Suicide prevention is everyone’s business. It begins with awareness demands that we notice and ends with our willingness to do something.
