MELBA VASQUEZ  Thank you for Voda(ph) very, very much and thank you audience for the ah, faith you have in me. Uhm, I'm incredibly honored to be here today. Uhm, it is a specially wonderful to see how this summit has grown over the years. I, and ah, I hope that what I have to say today ah, contributes to uhm, the goals of this National Multicultural Conference and Summit, and that is to provoke thought in the area of diversity. I mean I'll be talking about the challenge of conflict among allies including both the risks and the opportunities. Those of us who are members of marginalized groups and society often ally with each other. We bond, we unite in support of one another for the purpose of transcending oppressive forces in society and in our organizations in particular. Most of us hold expectations of mutual support. Therefore, it is particularly difficult and painful when marginalized groups, expected or assumed to be allies, find themselves in conflict with each other. In a group conflict, hatred, and violence in national and interna, international arenas had been the subject of max, much study. Alexander and Lavine(ph) have done mental analysis of all the work at an international level, at the national level, and within in our profession. Marginalized groups find themselves in conflict within one another. In our profession, we know that conflict brings suffering for us all. Conflict resolution and reconciliation are goals that offered the benefits of peace and welfare of all concerned. Since in 1950s and 1960s, scholars like Sheriff(ph) and Sheriff(ph) have attempted to understand the complex social mechanisms responsible for generating, sustaining, and resolving inter-group conflicts. Attempts to bridge theory, research, and practice are complex. In addition, it's complex to apply models to reduce conflict to specific groups and individuals. Address in these issues requires multi-strategy approaches and currents attempts have broaden focus from prejudice reduction to promoting social inclusion. That has been one of the goals of this National Multicultural Conference and Summit to promote an inclusive place where groups traditionally marginalized in society have a place to share knowledge and information and support. The final APA report of the task force on enhancing the diversity in 2004 describes how unspoken attitudes, unwillingness to share power or resources, resistance to movement from the status quo, and lack of experience with some of APA's under-represented members, can be under occurrence that lead to organizational barriers of exclusion. This summit has been one major happily on-going attempt to promote organizational change in this regard. Yet, even here, as well in our, ah, as well in our other psychology organizations, events and situations provoked ruptures, triggers, and collisions, resulting hurt, pain, and trauma occur, we end up in conflict. I would like to try to promote an understanding of my perspectives of the causes, the processes, and potential strategies for resolution in conflict among allies. Let me say that I believe we've all been in the role victims as well as perpetrators. These are terms that don't really fit all the time their dichotomies and the situations are often more complex and relativistic. But as I speak, I'm gonna encourage you and hope that you think of yourselves in either role because we're all in both roles at different times. I'm going to be calling upon several resources to make several ah, to make ah, points. Uhm, Aaron McGruder, for example, ah, has used his comic strip "Boondocks" to describe life in America for African-American people of color through the eyes of two kids for a full of attitude, intelligence, and rebellion. Huey, who's a leftist, ah, named for Huey Newton, and his younger brother, Riley, who's a gangster wannabe, are formerly city kids. They're having to live in wide suburbia with their grandfather because the grandfather has always a dream of owning a house in some place beautiful where he can retire. He acknowledges that he doesn't like to have ah, not, doesn't have to like all of the people there and they don't have to like him. This comic strip explores the issues involving African-American experience in society in American politics, and is often been controversial, both among white Americans and people of color as well. He's critical of everybody, challenging of everybody. Some people see Bill Watterson is using his characters, Calvin and Hobbes, as to debate a host of issues. Calvin is a walking embodiment of the human id, basically a good kid who can ah, control his impulses. Uhm, standing at his side is Hobbes, his stuffed tiger who embodies a superego. So I shall used McGruder's ah, Riley, Huey, Huey and Riley and Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes to help me illustrate some points along the way. Here is ah, Riley saying, "We've been walking for 10 minutes and haven't past one subway shop, ball court, Chinese carry-out place or, or rib shack." "Riley, we are pilgrims in an unholy land." (laugh) And here's Calvin and Hobbes. Let me describe the types of conflict that surfaced from time to time. Conflicts occur when injustices are perceived and expressed between men of color and women of color, women of color and white women, immigrants and American people of color, between LGBTQ, I just learned to add the Q last night by the way so I get used to that, LGBTQ communities and people of color, conflict between LGBTQ psychologist and military psychologist, between psychologist of faith and LGBTQ psychologist, between psychologist of color and Jewish psychologist, between persons with disabilities and people who are temporarily able-bodied from all these other groups. These are only some categories of conflicts that have tested the fiber and fabric of the association and its policies. Conflicts can occur within groups as well. For example, last year, APA Council of Representatives approved a resolution that calls on APA to take leadership and, and opposing anti-Semitism. It encourages research to better understand anti-Jewish preju, prejudice and to include appropriate information on anti-Semitism and its training materials and activities. This is a good thing. An addendum has been proposed that tries to distinguished between the length asserted in the context of this course regarding the actions of the state of Israel. The length between criticism of Israeli government policies and anti-Semitism is a subject of intense current debate and controversy. The addendum recognizes the controversial nur, nature of the assertion of such a length uhm, in society as well as within APA. It's, it's a controversy. There is disagreement among the Jewish community about this proposed addendum. Some believe that it undermines a clear commitment to anti-Semitism. Others believe that we have to be free to criticize some Israeli policies without being defined as anti-Semitic. It's a complex controversy and it's similar to the controversy stirred up by former President Jimmy Carter's book, "Palestine Not Apartheid, Peace Not Apartheid," about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The title has brought sharp critiques from American sympathetic to Israel. These issues stirrup intense feelings. Another example of conflicts with, ah, within groups is, is suggested by Aaron McGruder. Now, Huey has a, a, a new set of neighbors across the street. It's a biracial couple and the African-American ah, man is also half ah, black and half white. "Happy New Year, Huey. Well, I know none of the Negroes in this house care but it's also the last day of Kwanzaa. Today is the day of assessment. Today, when African-Americans sombrely meditate on things done and things yet to do, but I guess, Sam(ph), the only one concerned about, about reconnecting with this African culture so never mind. But I was just watching CNN and I saw some Africans getting their New Year's party on." "Well, tell them Ron(ph) Corenska(ph) said they're wrong." "You know, I think part of the problem with Kwanzaa is it kinda perpetuates its fallacy of a mono, monolithic African culture." "Hmm, expound." "The intent is good but the holiday ignores the variety and diversity of African cultures in favor of something oversimplified, even generic, interesting. I think I consider that a fair critique." "And what's with the candles? What is this? Some kinda low budget Hanukah(ph)?" (laughs) "Alright, alright, I get the point." And this is another African-American young man who smooth into the neighborhood as well. "Happy New Year, Huey." Sorry, I couldn't hang with the whole Kwanzaa thing." "It's okay, don't worry about it." "It's just a Kwanzaa feels so made-up like someone threw it together just to say, 'Okay, now we got a Christmas of our own,' but most people really don't understand the purpose, you know." "I guess." "I mean it's kinda like the black entertainment television of holidays." "Stop it." Those of you who know McGruder know that he's highly critical of BE thing. So there are differences within our groups as well. In addition to the addendum on the resolution on anti-Semitism, other specific risen events within APA have been contentious enough to require formal structures for a re, for solutions. One event involves a situation a couple of years ago when six African-American psychologist appointed by the APA board of directors presented their report to Council of Representatives on the World Congress, ah, ah, World Conference On Racism in Durban, South Africa. Tensions arose, tensions arose from the Jewish members of council based on their presumption that our representative should have left the World Congress On Racism when the representatives of the United States and Israel did in response to anti-Semitism expressed by some factions at the conference. Our psychologist representatives to the World Congress believe that their task, which they successfully accomplished, was to stay and ensure that mental health issues were addressed in the final report of the World Congress Against Racism. The result was considerable tension among co, members of the Council of Representatives that took over a year and a half to resolve. A task force was appointed by then APA President Diane Halpern to address the concerns which resulted in a report, the task force and the World Congress Against Racism report, findings and recommendations. You had a task force, you know, report on the report that there are six delegates ah, came, that came with a report on the World Congress Against Racism. The recommendations included that one council received the good work of the delegation. They've got language about the importance of mental health ah, into the UN Declaration against racism. And also number 2, that a resolution condemning the anti-Semitic and anti-Jewish discrimination be developed. That's the one that I was referring to a while ago. Ah, that resolution passed last year and it's ah, one of the outcomes of this task force. Importantly, a complex process of communication and negotiation was involved in reaching the satisfactory place and took over a year and a half. Sandy Shullman, chair of the task force, I served on it as did Neil Altman, Joel Ponte(ph), Florence Kaslow, Khorana Kordudu(ph), and William Parham. It was staffed by Leslie Cameron, of Public, of the Public Interest Directorate. Representatives from different perspectives were on this task force, and we often consulted and processed with a number of different constituents along the way. At the last 2005 Summit, the LGBTQ community was highly upset and offended that the organizers of the conference who consisted of people of color ah, from, with various intersections of identity, representing division 17, 35, 44, and 45 were perceived to have allowed a conversion therapy program to be scheduled and provided. How many of you attended the last summit? Okay, a little over half of you. How many were present at the town hall meeting at the end of the day, at the end of the conference? Okay, the most of you who attended. Immediately after that program and specially during the town hall feedback session, this community expressed the injuries to their dignity and sense of self. Some members of the racial ethnic minority community perceived and later conveyed the presumption that the complaints were overdone to the point of creating new injuries to the community, communities of color. Similar conflicts have occurred in other context at previous summits and in other settings. Now, one of the things that's true, one of the points that I wanna make is that when we do have expectations of safety, expectations of a, alliance, the pain is specially difficult. Here's McGruder showing this, making this point-forming. Ah, this is the biracial couple who lives across from Hewing(ph). "Honey, do you love me?" "Of course, sweetie." "And is that more important than anything else?" "It's more important than the air, than water, than life itself." (laughs) "Honey, I'm thinking about voting for Nader," this is during, during the last election. (laughs) "Get away from me you traitorous lying hussy." (laughs) "I'm sorry, sweetie. I, I just don't like" or "I don't like the whole system in this state," which is Illinois. "Always goes democratic anyway. It won't make any difference, I just don't wanna vote for the lesser two evils anymore." "Well, what about loyalty to your party you two-timing political floozie." (laughs) So, then she starts to push back a little bit okay. "See, ain't gonna be no more floozies in here alright." (laughs) Okay, so ruptures specially happened when we have expectations of being like-minded. A most recent and current rupture or collision occurred when leaders in division 35 and authors of ah, Jean Lochines(ph), edited biomes in women and leadership who have their own list serve, notice that the current January 2007 issue, the American psychologist just focused on leadership and not a single article, not a single article makes reference to leadership issues related to women, race ethnicity, class, ability, social class, age, sex orientation. The editor of the journal, our own Norman Anderson, APA CEO, and a special editor of the issue, Bob Sternberg, former APA president, are both considered allies. The distress is being constructively channeled in my perspective to communicate these concerns and to propose several strategies including new American psychologist po, policies that might prevent such oversights from occurring. Again, both allies have been contacted, both have responded in non-defensive, open, and conciliatory ways. Norman Anderson acknowledged the unacceptable nature of the problem and took a stance of openness and communi, commitment to prevent similar occurrences in the future. Bob Sternberg expressed his regret and agreed that a comment in the American psychologist and contributions of other papers that discussed these topics of leadership among diversity of peoples should be submitted. All involved have conducted their comments, concerns, expressions, and perceptions with respect, in my opinion, in an unconstructive manner. Let me, (claps) yes, thank you. Let, let, let me, let me add something. Last night, uhm, Division 35, President elect Jackie White said to me, and she looked around, she said, "You know, APA has come a long way. We have a long way to go but there are so many changes happened, that have happened." And many of us have been around for 20, 25, 30 years and we've seen these changes as well, but let me tell you these changes are happening and leaps and bounce ever since CEO Norman Anderson came ah, to take over. (applause)

MELBA VASQUEZ  He may not be perfect but he's close to it in my opinion. (laughs) And uhm, one of my points is that we are all vulnerable. We cannot be perfect all of the time. By the way, if you're not a member of APA, now is the time to join. Now is the time to join. We need each and everyone of you, anybody who cares to come to this conference really needs to be a member of the APA. I'm tended to ask you for sure of hands of how many, okay, how many of you are APA members? Raise your hand. Okay. I wanna say anybody who didn't raised their hand needs to go and join. If, if, if you can join online today, do it. If not, do it the minute you get back. It's my commercial for the day. (laughs) Okay. So, well, painful for all concerned and unintended that conflicts describe, underscore the need to recognize the injury that allies can and do cause one another. They illustrate the potential for further conflict, the need for increase to understanding, and the need to open new avenues to healing for all of us. I believe that we're the point whereas leaders and potential leaders of our profession, we must develop the skills to have these difficult dialogues to acknowledge, recognize, and resolve these often unintended ruptures and collisions that lead to pain, trauma, and end in conflicts. And I believe it'll be helpful to have a map of the likely dynamics and processes that are involved. And each of the case's examples that I've provided you, psychologist have eventually applied their psychological training and experience to resolve conflicts when possible and endeavor to engage in respectful and productive dialogue. I'd like to pro, try to provide an analysis of these processes in my talk today. I'm not withdrawing from the social psychological literature on inter-group conflict but mostly it present my own observations and thoughts from my and some of my colleagues' perspectives. Many of us have been working to develop strategies to address these conflicts with respect, compassion, and frankness. Much of my thought development has been influenced by colleagues with whom I've had several indebted conversations including the T, TPA task force members I mentioned, but specially Sandy Shullman, Rosie Phillips Bingham, Armand Cerbone, Linda Forrest, Jessica Henderson Daniel, and many others who worked hard formally and informally to promote healthy strategies. APA has found several models for conflict resolution particularly effective. Among these are mandated and negotiated face-to-face dialogue, diversity training, we have had diversity training at the council of representatives once a year for last the last couple of years. And board of directors arbitrated ah, brokered arbitration among members of affected groups including employments of task forces such ah, a couple of the ones the I've mentioned. Other strategies have involved formal workshop and convention to promote and increase understanding. And example of increasing understanding through dialogue took place in a form at the convention in Washington D.C. in August of 2005 where Rosie Bingham, Sandy Shullman, and I facilitated several panelist who discussed reactions to unlearnings arrived from the conflicts among marginalized groups at the summit in January, 2005. There were couple of pe, couple of hundred people there. How many of you were at that, at that particular program? Okay, several of you. Uhm, panelist and, and participants engaged in respectful dialogue that acknowledged injury, clarified issues generating tensions and trust ah, and, and, and increase trust. In New Orleans in 2006, Armand Cerbone is chair of, of a VIP, organized eight hours of programming by the Public Interest Directorate and other co-sponsor has focused on several topics with the theme, "When multi-cultural worlds collide." Many other groups have worked on this as well including the 2006 workshop by the Division 17 section for the advancement of women by Barbara(ph) and Sing(ph). Others continued this work through various activities including at this conference. The point is it takes a lot of energy, a lot work, a lot of time. Let me talk a little bit more about the nature of conflict and some of the risks involved. For the purposes of this presentation, I'm using the terms "collisions," "triggers," and "ruptures," synonymously. These occur when members of marginalized group ah, perceived a violation, an offense, a threat to integrity and dignity, and a sense of self. These often results in trauma of some sort. Maria, Ruth, and others, have addressed issues involving the insidious trauma that people from marginalized groups experienced on a regular basis, often daily. Ruth Fassinger talks about a thousand points of slights that the GOBTGQ community members experienced on a daily basis as well. Derald Wing Sue and others have point the term "microaggressions" to refer to these ah, events, except sometimes are not so micro. What are the sources of inter-group conflict? Research that identifies sources of inter-group conflict to identify cognitive factors like social categorization and social identity theories, motivational the, ah, factors like social dominance stirring, prejudice attitudes and how are these all manifested and settled rather than overweighs, for example, aversive racism, modern racism, symbolic racism, and enlightened racism, contribute to inter-group conflict even amongst ourselves. We oft, we often conceptualize uhm, ourselves to be in our ingroup. And when we do that, we don't particularly relate to people who relegated to the outgroup. And this process usually happens unconsciously, and has tremendous consequences to how we relate to others. We treat people in the ingroup with regard and respect. We go the extra mile and we are considerate. We giver them the benefit of the doubt and foibles are hardly noticed. On the other hand, people in the outgroup are either ignored and neglected, and when they are ah, on a radar screen, we are at best distant and we convey negative regard. We assume the worst and we're harsher with our judgments and condemnations. Up a toe, a social psychologist described how when we form groups in that "we"-"they" dichotomy, people are more able to treat "they" as objects in insensitive ways to the point of launching an holocaust-types of activities. People in our eye, in our ingroups are more highly valued, more trusted, and engender, engendered greater cooperation as oppose to competition, more compassion as oppose to judgment and con, condemnation. And these processes are largely unconscious. As perpetrators, we can be blind or not a sympathic with the potential effects of our behavior. In the words of my colleague, Nancy Russo, "Sometimes, people who ordinarily maybe supportive get focus and under high cognitive load, and the resulting tunnel vision undermines their otherwise ordinary inclusiveness." In addition, we sometimes engaged in hurtful behaviors because it has not occurred to us, that certain behaviors are hurtful. For example, I was a perpetrator doing a meeting in a former APA President Ron Levant's task force on enhancing diversity(ph). One of the main charges to this group was to incru, im, improve APA's welcomeness to diverse groups within the association. We did most of our work via email but we did meet once. Because we had a representative in a wheelchair, on the first of two evenings, we made sure to go to a restaurant that was accessible. Even though it was accessible however, the access for people in wheelchairs was around back in through the kitchen because the front entrance had six steps. We did not notice that until our colleague, Roda Oaken(ph), who is using her crutches that night, pointed it out. However, the second night, Roda Auken(ph), who by the way, gave me permission to use her name and to share this story, chose to rest and not attend our dinner. It was unspoken but we, therefore, went to a restaurant that was not accessible and had, had chosen it and rejected it the day before. The next day, when Roda realized that we attended a restaurant that wasn't accessible, it was clear to me for the very first time that our doing so was hurtful when I observed her reactions. Later in the day, she made the recommendation that we encourage APA to not hold meetings in hotels, buildings, and restaurants that were not accessible whether a person with disabilities was present or not, just as we would not hold meetings at any place that barred women, Latino or Jews. The community with disabilities would want our support and, to avoid inaccessible structures in order to make a statement. I know the rest of this would want this, the rest of us would want this that members of our groups encountered obstacles to entry of any kind. Now, here was a gathering of Psychologists, hand-picked and invited to serve because of our expertise and sensitivity to diversity, and we were all insensitive to this issue. These processes are unconscious at times until we work or someone makes us work to make them conscious. Now, I've observed that when we get injured and experienced traumas, triggers, or ruptures, we have, we may have a tendency to objectify our perpetrators. Trust is violated and we get traumatized. Sometimes, we respond with silence, often we choose to say nothing. My friend Jessica Henderson Daniel says, "People of color edit themselves on a daily basis," so do members of other marginalized groups. Often, this is a strategy for survival. We have to make choices about choosing our battles or our conflicts. Other times, we do engage in the expression of anger or hurt about the indignity about how we've been treated. At times, this takes a form of what I call "righteous indignation." It's sometimes important to convey and express our outrage in the effects of the perpetrator's behaviors, choices, omissions, or commissions, honest as individuals or as groups, and to point out how these are potentially based in bias and prejudice. These expressions are the points that which we choose to enter into the conflict which maybe minor nature get resolve quickly or major, and take months if not years to resolve. McGruder suggests, and this is a cover of his, one of his books, we have a right to be hostile. We have a right to feel anger and responds to triggers, collusions, and ruptures. Well, perhaps we have a right to be hostile, but we have to think about that. "I got a right to be hostile, men. My people's been persecuted," his grandfather says. "And I suppose you'll find justice in making yourself miserable." Hmm, I hate wisdom. We don't wanna make ourselves miserable in the process.

00:33:50
MELBA VASQUEZ  Armand Cerbone, Rosie Bingham, Shulman, ah, Ra, ah, Sandy Shulman and I conceptualized three ways to view conflict in our uhm, APA Convention Program last year. The wa, the first is conflict is bad and should be avoided. This is based on ah, the, this is view, generally base on a fighter flight ah, response. It's a win-lose perspective. A second way to view conflict is you can't get rid of conflicts so it's either to be manage in a win-lose or compromised manner. And, and compromise isn't always the right kind of compromise as Calvin and Hobbes. This sculpture would be called the Spirit of Compromise. "We'll make each snowman and have them shakin' hands, great. This will be very inspirational. People will weep to see two snowmen overcoming their differences and cooperating. Soon, we'll be rolling in public commissions. Make your snowman's arm longer, his hand won't reach my snowman's hand." "Now, why should I make a new arm just make yours longer? Then, it'll look like my, my snowman had to reach farther than yours did. They should be equal." "Then, build your snowman closer over here. I am not gonna start all over, just make your arm longer." "I refuse, you can't tell me what to do. In that case, my snowman refuses to shake hand, shake with your snowman." "So what? My snowman won't even talk to yours. I'm turning his head the other way." "Ha! While he's looking over there, my snowman will kick your snowman in his big white butt." "Oh yeah. Well, mine knocks your snowman's head off." "Fine, my snowman feeds your snowman his own noise." "Ah!" I don't think this sculpture is very good. It's a compromise. So the third perspective is that conflict should be embraced. It's a desirable opportunity to make a difference. Uhm, here's ah, Calvin and Hobbes again. The fact is that the process of embracing conflict is a difficult challenge. "Everything is so darn hard. I wish I could just take a pill to be perfect and I wish I could just push a button to have everything I want. The American dream leaves on. Why should I have to work for everything it's like saying I don't deserve it." On the other hand, "Why are you diggin' a hole?" "I'm looking for buried treasure." "What have you found?" "A few dirty rocks, a weird root and some disgusting grubs." On your first try, there's treasure everywhere. And sometimes, that's the attitude we have to have to approach conflict resolution. Ah, many of us operate from the first two perspectives and sometimes, that's understandable. Many conflict engagements have negative outcomes, but despite the hard work that engagements and conflict resolution requires, we believe that's worth the effort. When we truly engaged in those processes that I'm gonna describe in a minute, something happens inside of us, something shifts and that's very powerful. Ah, but before I do that, let me talk about the negative outcomes ah, some negative outcomes of conflict. Ah, why we have to be specially careful in the process? Uhm, mental health implications. First, the perpetrations result in violation of identity and shaming. Secondly, telling someone, specially someone from another marginalized group, that they have been perpetrators, risks, shaming and offending. None of us likes to be told that we've made a mistake by offending others. When our errors are pointed out, we're usually horrified and the natural re, reaction is to be defensive, to try to explain our intent. I call it the "during headlights response." That's how I usually feel, ah! You know, so that during headlights feeling. My presumption is that when people of color uhm, and those from other marginalized groups perhaps are accused of mistakes. For most of us, we don't have to be told too many times to get it. Because of stereotyped threat, the work of hot steel and other processes were easily shamed into feeling less then, or we have to expend considerable energy to avoid going there(ph). This is another negative outcome of uhm, conflict. Now, I do wanna acknowledge that people experienced ah, situations differently. You can't just say, "Well, I'm gonna tell him this way because I wouldn't mind being told in this manner. Ah, besides that, they need to know this." Well, if we do enter a conflict, we have to know that it may not have the impact that we intend, so we have to be sensitive to that. Uhm, I also wanna point out something that Maya Angelou have said that continuous to have an impact on me. I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. Uhm, so how do we, when injured, enter into an embraced conflict? How do we, when confronted, embrace the conflict to develop an opportunity to make a constructive difference? Before I talk again about the resolution, ah, ah, conflict resolution process, I'd like to identify a few more factors that makes these processes complex. I've already eluded to some of them. Uhm, That seem, the more you know, the harder it is to, to take decisive action. Once you become informed, you start seeing complexities in shades of gray. You realize that nothing is as clear and simple as it first appears. Ultimately, knowledge is paralyzing. Being a man of action I can't afford to take that risk. Well, you're ignorant but at least you act on it. One of the things that makes these processes more complex is that, well, we may all be created equally, we don't carry equal privilege and power. Society confers uhm, White power ah, society confers White privilege. For example, and then here's Watterson again. "I no longer wish to be called a boy." "Isn't that what you are?" "Yes, but I find that term demeaning and sexist." "What do you want to be called then?" "A chromosomally advantaged youth." That may not catch on. The difficult dialogs that took place about two events uhm, two of the events that I described. There were congress against racism at the last Summit that I described these examples ah, involved an analysis later in each case that identify the fact that expresses, expressions of outrage by those who have privilege, White privilege despite being also part of marginalized groups of LGBTHQ(ph) and Jewish identity in part use their privilege of power that may resulted in some lack of perspective-taking at times. An analysis of four studies by Galinsky(ph), Magi(ph), Enyce(ph), and Greenfield demonstrated that power is associated with increase difficulty in taking other individual's perspectives. Some, a new study that just came out recently. Power is defined as a capacity to influence other people and it emerges uhm, from control over valuable resources and the ability to administer rewards and punishments. The powerful act, more and with greater variability than the non-powerful. Now, I do acknowledge that there are different kinds of privilege and power but we can't underestimate the often unconscious privilege of being White. And he, here is McGruder talking about power. "Life would be so much more interesting if we could have some superpowers like, if you could choose a superpower like flying or super strength or super speed or shooting ah, energy beams from your eyes or whatever, what would you pick?" Hmm. Interesting question. I think I'd like the power to crush the throats of the insolent with force like Darth Vader. You know, I'm starting to understand what people mean when they say that you just go a little too far sometimes. What? I never said I wouldn't use a power for good. Individuals prime with power anchored to have lain their own vantage points and demonstrate reduce accuracy when assessing the emotions and thoughts of others. The authors of the analysis of these studies hypothesize that this is an unconscious psychological state that makes perspective-taking less liking(ph). Compared with low-powered individuals, high-powered individuals are less focus on the meaning of psychological perspective ta, ah, taking of those around them and I suggest that this is another form, I suggest that another form of perspective of, of power maybe that derived from righteous indignation. This emotional state may fuel the unconscious psychological state that wipes out the ability to be emphatic and to take other's perspective. That's my hypothesis but I think I've observed some versions of that. Perhaps this happens especially when the injured party generally has access to power by virtue of being White or possesses other anthesis of power. The authors of the studies, ah, identify number of reasons why power may diminish perspective-taking. First by definition, people in power have control over valuable resources and are therefore less dependent on others. To accomplish their goals, the powerful do not need to rely on an accurate comprehensive understanding of others. Second, power is typically associated with increase demands on attention so that it is difficult for power-holders to take perspective of everybody under their charge. Another factor contributing to uhm, ah, the complexity of conflict-resolution in addition to power and privilege is that racial ethic-minorities in women are jard(ph), judge more harshly in society. This unfortunate reality is describe by all kinds of analysis for people of color in the judicial system and studies that indicate that students tend to challenge the authority of female professors and faculty of color more often than White male faculty. In the literature, that describes the devaluation of women and people of color in the workplace. Uhm, and we know, uhm, that given the historical oppressive experiences in society, we may have a tendency to be more ah, easily shamed. "Time's almost stop, Huey. What's gonna be our big story?" "Sigh, I don't know." He has a, a newsletter that goes out and tries to promote revolution. And this is during the ca, last camp, presidential campaign. I feel like we've gotten lazy with the campaign coverage. I wanna challenge the public, not just talk about how dumb Bush is every week. Of course, if you are eye(ph) with that dumb in running for president, would anyone led up on us? Hmm. Excellent point. So, even when a colleague from a marginalized group makes a mistake, given that we have a tendency to be more harshly judge and more easily shamed. I'm more likely to move towards support rather than move away from in distance myself, you know. Sometimes there's a dynamic that when one of us makes a mistake we go "Oh my god." And sort of move away. My colleague Patricia Arredondo at a meeting where she heard someone berate and ethic-minority who wasn't present uhm, for failure, said, "You know, we have to support each other even if, maybe specially if we're struggling and not doing well." Many of us have had to fight against internalize racism. Days like this, I look at it all to snow and think, "man this is beautiful." Then, I wonder, is it really beautiful or have we just been conditioned to think of everything white as beautiful? Hah. In my mind perhaps, not ah, is my mind perhaps not as liberated from the slave mentality as I thought. Then, I think, what if snow were brown? Would I find it as nice to look at or would it look dirty? Is this indicative that somewhere within my subconscious lurks ah, some heretofore undiscovered self hate. You know, I don't know how much an hour a therapy cost, but I think that's gonna be your Christmas gift for me. Aha. I wonder how febricant(ph) feels about snow. Ha ha. Now, after the last Summit, our colleague Thomas Parnham send a challenging letter to the four sponsoring division news letters, that many viewed as provocative. How many of you read that letter? Hah? He questioned the privilege that he perceived to be inappropriately place in some of the expressions of pain and indignation at the town hall meeting at the Summit. Reactions to his letter varied from outrage and offense to validation and provocative thought. It transformed many discussions whether you like the letter or not, it transformed the discussions. It became clear that expressions by the LB, LGBTGQ community of the pain they express was experienced at least partly, and perceive as shaming as others continue to convey their righteous indignation. Even after the organizers apologized several times, those expressions often have an intended impact and consequences as I said. Now, remember that power is associated with a reduce tenancy to comprehend how others, how other individual see the world, think about the world and feel about the world and there's all kinds of power including I think the power of righteous indignation, perspective-taking and e, empathizing, decreases stereotyping, power increases stereotyping and power decreases perspective-taking. As a result of Parnham's letter in the discussions that ensued, some of the injured realized that they had unintentionally in part become perpetrators. I was very touch by some of the acknowledgments from some of my colleagues. Objective find others in a self-interested way and stereotyping others maybe part of that cognitive tool box that power holders use to stay in control. However, lack of perspective-taking and disregard for the concerns, emotions and individuality of others, their humanity can lead to bitterness and in, in sapient rebellion. Power uhm, and lack of perspective-taking may allow the powerful to accomplish their short-term goals but lead to long term ah, loss of power. Action oriented power combined with perspective-taking maybe a particularly constructive force. If the powerful are led to take the perspectives of others, their actions ultimately might benefit the lives of the less powerful while remaining in power. Another challenge has to do with the difficulty in trying to empathize across too many levels of pain. A psychologist were used to empathizing with other's pain and can't deal with our own perhaps. When we do attend to our pain we may, we may loss the ability to see it in others. One way ah, to do this is to move out of our pain temporarily. We have to cognitively do that and try to listen to the other with curiosity. And here's McGruder talking about perspective-taking. It's one of my favorites. Oh, this is the daughter of that biracial couple. So she's one quarter African-American. She looks White and has curly hair. "Here Huey, I know you've been down so I bought you this card. Oh, Jasmine you shouldn't," says friends and his little kids hugging. "You shouldn't have." "Isn't it pretty? I'm going to be physically ill. This is supposed to cheer me up, the angelic white kids card, but yeah." "You couldn't go a few feet down to the black greeting card section. What? Where the mahogany cards sold out? Sure they are corny but at least there are some card poke on him. I thought it was a thought that counts. You weren't thinking." "I'm sorry I gave you a bad card but you don't have to be so mean," as she cries. Wow, slow down. "I'm, I'm, I'm sorry." "Really? I hate apologizing." Contemporary, ah, ah, ah, le, let's talk more now 'bout their actual conflict resolution process for the opportunities exist. Contemporary theories of conflict-resolution uhm, of conflict reduction include decharazation(ph)-, re-characterization and cross-cutting category membership. The challenge has been to apply these foundational theories to real life in a group conflict and our model that we used last August involved the following: awareness, including effort and practice in developing awareness; communication, including effort and practice in communication; and perspective-taking for both victims and perpetrators. The effort and practice, so I'm gonna describe that process. Now, here is ah, effort and, and practice, important of effort and practice. "Listen boy, you're smart, you really are but you're young boy. I don't care how many of them books you read that can't make up to the lessons life is gonna teach you. Take it from this soul man. The world's gonna show you how things aren't so cut-and-dry, so black and white. There is subtleties and nuances, and kind of multiplexities(ph) that you just aren't learned of, that you just ain't learned about yet, you hear me?" Interesting. And in case she was about to say something smart I realize multiplexities(ph) isn't a word. Hey, I would just figure that it was one of those things I hadn't le-, learned yet, I hadn't, excuse me. So, complexities, effort and practice was them experience. Awareness involves the ability to a, assess evaluate and beware of what's cause in the intensity of one's feelings. The ability to become more and more aware of how we put people in other categories rather than include them in our group, consciously and unconsciously. The Multicultural Guidelines published in 2003 encourages to be aware of these processes in all our work and with each other. This has implications for ability to understand and empathize. Other aspects of awareness and this is modified from Barbara(ph) and Sing(ph), include the importance of, of working on those working alliances, nurturing the relationships. We have to engage in self-care so that we are in good shape, you know. So that we know our limits, we know if we're vulnerable, we know whether we wanna enter the dialogue. We have to ah, be aware of our privilege and our power and our lack of. It's helpful to inculcate an attitude of curiosity about the other when you approach a dialogue. Ah, sometimes groups have to have a separatist period from each other to process. Uhm, we have to express uhm, our, our feelings but we have to be careful that if we enter that room of righteous indignation that maybe ah, ah, ha, hurtful. On the other hand, when people are hurt we may get hurt also. Uhm, be aware of your role. Are you a victim, a perpetrator a rescuer and an abler, a helpless bystander? Aim for a healthy stands of listening. The primary goal of communication in conflict-resolution should be to increase understanding. To increase understanding, not to prove who's right or wrong. Healthy and open communication in a conflict-resolution process involves the ability to understand, acknowledge, validate each other's position, identifying common interest and goals and having mutual participation in solving the problem. Communication for the purpose of increasing understanding not winning as a challenge for most of us. Now, I do wanna say something about activism. Ah, when we do engage in that righteous indignation, it feels authentic and genuine at that time uhm, and, and as I said several times you can run the risk of creating your ruptures. On the other hand, not expressing our feelings ah, is problematic as well. And I, I do wanna say that there is a times, a time and a place to be able to express feelings of intensity and passion. Sometimes our traumas are so triggered, we don't have a choice, we have another consequences but other times there is a place for loud activism. What I would say is that I believe that the place in our association right now that is not necessarily needed most of the time. Uhm, I, I think most of the time we, we can afford to communicate with respect, compassion and consideration. What's the deal? Trying to paid out on issue of the free Huey(ph) world report but I'm feeling uninspired, not angry enough to world I guess. Well, that's odd. G.W. Bush, Eddie Griffin, Bob Johnson tried that, nothing. I'm just having trouble writing today. It's like I have this overall feeling of calmness and well-being, almost optimism. Whew, glad that's over, let's get to work. Men, I was worried there for a second. Uhm, that doesn't need comment I think. Uhm, the uhm, guidelines for, it's important to have guidelines for communication ah, when I was on a task force for the World Congress Against Racism, Sandy Shulman uhm, had this brainstorm the rules that we wanted to use in operations. Sometimes you have to do that when feelings are so volatile. Uhm, communication with respect, compassion is important. It's important to be willing to stay engage, to commit to the engagement even when feelings are intense. You may take timeout but you have to stay engage in the process. And you have to guard against ah, patronizing stances. Uhm, this is ah, a developmental issue ah, and uhm, you know sometimes we have to give each other feedback about that sometimes not. It is important to have realistic goals? If you could have anything in the world right now, what would it be? Hmm. Anything at all, whatever you want, a sandwich. A sandwich, what kind of stupid wish is that? Talk about failure of imagination. I'd ask for trillion billion dollars, my own space shuttle in a private continent. I got my wish. (laughs) Understanding is hopefully the goal or outcome of communication an increasing perspective-taking, understanding, empathy and ability, ability to convey these are involve in the third major part of the conflict-resolution process. Perspective-taking has been shown to be an important strategy for decreasing stereotyping and prejudice and for building social bonds. It takes a considerable amount of motivation and capacity for feedback to move from indignation to understanding and repair. Yes, five minutes. And both perpetrators and victims have to be motivated to increase understanding. Understanding can lead to empathy and repair and can rebuilt trust and as I said earlier something shifts inside of us when understanding has been communicated. It's very important process, empathy. Mom wants to know if we'd like to go to the zoo today, can we tour a prison after work? No, thanks. So how do we engage in this process without walking on egg shells? We have to have an agreement to express our injuries and as hearable in ah, inoffensive the manner is possible. Nancy Russo says, "We will get farther if we focus on what positively can be done rather than attacking what has gone before. I really like that. We have to listen in an open non-defensive manner whether we're perpetrators or victims. Remember that conflicts are compounded by ambiguous communication, a failure to consider different perspective and an autocratic approach to exercise power and communication. When the communication seems cold and uncaring, is disparaging and sarcastic conflict will only increase, more injuries will occur. There is no place for the communication of disdain and contempt in these processes. Assume the best about others involve in the dialogue. Uhm, like Calvin says, "love the sinner, hate the sin." Work to truly listen to the other. If you find yourself not wanting to listen, you should probably not be involve in the conflict resolution process and listen carefully, skip that one. Ah, the importance of authenticity uhm, there's Calvin ah, beating up on Susie(ph) again, I must say the stinging snow makes your cheeks look positively radiant. Some people cannot take a compliment. Be genuine about what you're communicating. Ah, if you speak to soon ah, and, or disingenuous it won't be effective, I mean skip some of these. I do, I do wanna mention these. There is a burden uhm, in raising the issues. Hello? Huey, hey! It's your great uncle Chris, how are you? A better question is how are you? Are you happy living in a world without justice for the masses. Oppression reigns unchecked throughout most of the world, how do you feel about that and what about the environment? Gee, I hadn't thought of it like that. Not to mention, the senseless acts of violence still plague in our people, sees a destruction growing forth from the so-, soil of hopelessness and despair. We must save the next generation. Oh my goodness. Anyway, you wanna talk to grand dad? No, not anymore. I have to go think about some things. Small talk skills continue to elude me. So it is the burden, a burden to raise the issues ah, but ah, sometimes important. Taking a perspective uhm, is complicated again when people are part of the out group. Uhm, let me go ahead and ah, summarize. This is my summary of the key points I want you to take away from here. People will never forget how you made them feel in the words of Maya Angelou so when we heard others the goal is to repair and change those feelings that we've engendered, ah, engendered and that's doable. People who ordinarily may not be supportive, get focus to another high cognitive load and a resulting tunnel visions, sometimes gets, sometimes undermines there what would be ordinarily, ordinarily have inclusiveness. So it's important to have compassion for ourselves when we may cares as well as for others who care that they have made errors. Racial ethnic-minorities in women and probably members of other marginalized groups are judge more harshly in society. Some, most of us don't want to be hit over their head when we made mistakes. This is important to remember in communications. We'll get further if we focus on what positively can be done rather than attacking what has gone before, this is solution focus. Communication as reconstructive, productive ah, after acknowledging regret. The regret needs to be heard, that apology that so hard to, to make sometimes. Ah, we uhm, we do so by awareness, communication, understanding and perspective-taking. Hopefully this model is a helpful one for you. Thank you so much for your attention. Thank you. (applause)
