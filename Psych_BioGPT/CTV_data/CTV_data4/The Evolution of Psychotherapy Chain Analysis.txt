Chain Analysis 

00:00:55
Marsha Linehan, Phd 

00:00:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so, this is supposed to be a clinical demonstration. I’ve never done a clinical demonstration, where you just pick someone out of an audience, known as a big audience, being tapped and it mattered. I’ve done a lot of times in big audience and didn’t matter and then I’m really at my very best. But, I’m going to do my very best, who’ve still viewed my very best. So, this is an example of a chain analysis. First, I have two people willing to be, subjects, guinea pigs, is what I was gonna say I guess maybe some more of that. And so I’m gonna ask -- uhm, so I’m looking to find out who is willing to do this, because I’m hoping to be so good that we need more than one. Uh, but -- so I need someone who has a behavior that they want to change that I can help them with, that they’re willing to be public about. We cannot be so habitual like being substance dependent, where you’re still drunk, because we have found out that uhm, chain analysis -- behavioral analysis would fit for that, but a chain analysis is really, we’re looking at a single instance of behavior. So, who might I have? I know I have someone here. So, could I get you to go over there and get yourself -- you have to sign papers, because you’re gonna be like a movie star. Uhm and can I see -- could you tell me what behavior you’re trying to change. I had to make sure it’s appropriate for the public. 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN Anxiety. 

00:02:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, well, I’m really looking for -- she is -- you said anxiety, but what I -- and that’s always a good one and I know you’re probably anxious just telling me that you have anxiety. So, I got to say, 12,000 girls start to see you right away for that, but what I wanna pick is someone who has a behavior that they do, that has irritated people. For example, coming late to work, uh, not doing the dishes or doing things that harm others or doing things that harm yourself or overeating or are there any other good behaviors that we owned. What’s yours? 

00:03:25
UNKNOWN Well, over here is the one, but the other one is slow to speak, it will take... 

00:03:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Slow to speak. 

00:03:35
UNKNOWN Somebody is talking to me bad (inaudible ). 

00:03:37
MARSHA LINEHAN I didn’t actually hear that, but what I’ve got is one person has got a behavior that’s missing, namely writing. So, now I need a person with a behaviors there. I’ll check you first, let me see yours. 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN I’m consistently late to church, the problem 'cos I’m marrying the minister. 

00:03:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, it’s a problem for who? 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN It’s a problem, because I’m marrying the minister and I... 

00:03:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, she is concerned -- oh, you’re too good for worse. Yeah, I’m taking you, over here. Oh, how divine. This is the best. I hate to tell, but you’re better -- you’re better than my first person. Okay, maybe I’ll do you first. Did you all hear this? She is consistently late to church and she is marrying the minister. You’re gonna make yourself look very problematic in front of the -- the -- the congregation I can tell you, right now. Okay, while they’re signing up and I might need a third, but, uhm, I don’t know, I might not be that good, but, uhm, what -- uhm, and I’m -- you know, what I’m gonna do over here is I’m gonna take the minister person first, friend -- friend over there, writing block person, hello, over there. I’m gonna take the minister's future wife first, ’cos so much fun. Okay, and I can do some real good, maybe. Okay, so here’s a thing that while they’re getting ready and signing all their paper work, I’m gonna do both of them now. But here’s the deal, I’m gonna to tell you what a chain analysis is. A behavioral analysis is what you do when a person first comes in and you’re looking at an entire pattern of behavior. And so, I -- I might have to do a little, uhm, behavioral analysis here, but in a behave -- but what you’re looking for in a chain analysis is there’s certain steps in it. The first step is to find the problem behavior, okay. And generally, you do a chain on just one instance of the behavior and then you do it on another instance, another and another. If you do a whole bunch of these, all -- you’ll see -- you figure out what the patterns across time and events, okay. So, a chain is one time, like, well, I’m just gonna say, when was the last time you were late for church, okay? And we will start with that. So, it’s one instance of the behavior. So, first, you define the behavior, because you’ve got to get clear exactly what are you -- what is the problematic behavior here and what are you talking about, okay. Then, what you’re trying to do is see what are the -- you’re looking for what I call the controlling variables, okay. So, the controlling variables are events that occur ahead of the behavior, that shape that behavior or cause the behavior. So, you’re looking for what was the prompting event, what was the event that started the chain that got you to be late, okay. So, the reason this is important is, it’s that if you were late for church today, you would not say the chain that started it was when you were five years old, your mother punishes you for being on time or for being late and you’re rebelling, okay. That might be what it -- that might be the history of the whole thing, but that would not be the event that prompts it in the present time, okay. That’s just the warning history. That would be called the vulnerability factors, okay. So, what you do is you take the behavior, you go back in time and see when did that start. So, for example, we do chain analysis on any one who’s late to treatment team and we general say, when did you get up or when was the first moment at that you realized you might be late? Or when was the first one -- you know we get usually meetings in the morning sort of what were the events that occurred beforehand. And we try to figure out every single place where had you done something different, you might not had a problematic behavior. So, you’re looking for sort of what are the variables. So for example, I used to be late to my team and, uhm, more often, then it was a good idea and we always do a chain analysis. So, what we discovered was -- was I would get up in the morning and read the New York Times. And then I would sort of forget about time and by the time I remembered what time it was, it was always too late to get myself organized to get out of the house to get there on time. So, we had to get me on the day of team, I couldn’t read the New York Times anymore, okay. And that basically solves the problem, because then I didn’t get lot of course, I couldn’t read any other paper either. Uh, but -- so -- so that’s what a chain analysis is, you also always wanna look at the consequences. Maybe you’re being been forced for a behavior. So, maybe where it is, is there. So, for example, people that I treat sometimes cut themselves for example. And the problem with themselves, they feel better immediately, okay. So, then we know that the behavior's being reinforced as a -- and that was called a negative reinforcement, something aversive goes away. And so, then we would -- I would say the personal -- what the -- what’s another way to feel better other than this? What can we do, so that you could feel better, 'cos I'm feeling better? How can you feel better without cutting yourself? So that’s more or less what it is. I don’t wanna go too much more. We’ll spend all of our time talking and none of our time showing. So, miss engaged to a minister. I can’t wait. This is so great. 

00:09:10
CHANTAL You know what’s really funny is, when I go to therapy I don’t even use my health insurance, 'cos I don’t want any record of anything. So -- so. 

00:09:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:09:25
CHANTAL No, no, no. 

00:09:25
MARSHA LINEHAN No, I’m gonna let you out of this. 

00:09:25
CHANTAL No, no, I’m good. 

00:09:25
MARSHA LINEHAN You -- you’re sure? 

00:09:25
CHANTAL Yeah, I’m okay. 

00:09:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. I mean you don’t have to do it. 

00:09:30
CHANTAL No, I’m good. 

00:09:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, what’s your name? 

00:09:30
CHANTAL Chantal(ph). 

00:09:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Chantal, okay, where do you live? 

00:09:35
CHANTAL I live in Florida. 

00:09:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. This won’t be sold widely. Alright, I assume -- how about if you turn a little more towards me? 

00:09:40
CHANTAL Okay. 

00:09:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Now, let me sit down? I have a bad back from the fall. 

00:09:50
CHANTAL Oh, I’m sorry. 

00:09:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Yes -- okay. Let me get here, okay. Alright, Chantal, uhm, how long you’ve been engaged? 

00:10:00
CHANTAL How long have I been engaged? 

00:10:00
MARSHA LINEHAN How long have you been engaged to a minister? 

00:10:05
CHANTAL Uhm, well, we’ve been talking about -- about for two months. We just finally found the ring two weeks ago and it’s being all made by the jeweler. So, it’s all gonna be official next week. 

00:10:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Ooh, too fabulous. Well, congratulations. 

00:10:15
CHANTAL Thanks. 

00:10:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Alright, so, when you say you’re late to church, what time does church start on Sunday? 

00:10:25
CHANTAL 10:00. 

00:10:25
MARSHA LINEHAN 10 o’clock, okay. And when you’re late, how late would you say you are? 

00:10:30
CHANTAL Uhm, five to 10 minutes, I usually make it before the sermon, but -- but it’s happened that I’ve been up to 20 minutes late. 

00:10:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:10:40
CHANTAL And now people are starting to comment. 

00:10:45
MARSHA LINEHAN I see. Has -- is this always been you’re church or is it just become your church since you’ve been dating and gotten engaged? 

00:10:50
CHANTAL Yeah, I didn’t go to church before. 

00:10:55
MARSHA LINEHAN I see. So, this is new behavior even going at all. 

00:10:55
CHANTAL Yes. 

00:10:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:10:55
CHANTAL But I have this, starting this problem sometimes with my 9 o’clock patience. 

00:11:05
MARSHA LINEHAN I see. So in other words getting to things on time in the morning is not your long sick? 

00:11:05
CHANTAL Right. 

00:11:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. All right. And now, there’s no real point in going through this whole thing unless you would actually like to change it. 

00:11:15
CHANTAL I would. 

00:11:15
MARSHA LINEHAN You would? 

00:11:15
CHANTAL Yes. 

00:11:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, you’re sure? 

00:11:15
CHANTAL I’m positive. 

00:11:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, got, alright. So, that’s where we’ll work on then. Okay, so you’re five to ten minutes late and how -- how far away do you live from the church? 

00:11:25
CHANTAL Uhm, 30 to 40 minutes. 

00:11:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, wow, you have a long drive. 

00:11:30
CHANTAL Yes. 

00:11:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so, uhm, alright, so on Sunday mornings, before church, what time do you ordinarily get up? 

00:11:45
CHANTAL Uhm, anywhere between 6:00 and 7:00. 

00:11:50
MARSHA LINEHAN In the morning? 

00:11:50
CHANTAL Yes. I mean that’s typically my -- you know, 7:30 is the latest that I ever wake up. So... 

00:12:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, alright. So, in other words, you’re awake in time to get to church on time. 

00:12:05
CHANTAL Yes. 

00:12:05
MARSHA LINEHAN All right. So, the problem isn’t that you oversleep? 

00:12:05
CHANTAL No. 

00:12:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So, when you get up at 6:00 or 7:00, give me the blow-by-blow. So, let’s go back to the last time you were late, when was that? 

00:12:15
CHANTAL Uhm, two -- well, I’m always late, but the last time I went to church was two weeks ago. 

00:12:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So, two weeks ago, you were late. And so -- can you -- so if you -- just take a moment here, try to recollect two weeks ago, can you remember it? 

00:12:30
CHANTAL I don’t remember that specific day, but I can -- I remember typically what I do on Sunday mornings. 

00:12:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so you get up on Sunday morning between 6:00 and 7:30. So, let’s imagine, we’ll just take the worst-case scenario, you're up at 7:30. 

00:12:45
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:12:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so then what do you do when you get up? 

00:12:45
CHANTAL I make Cuban coffee. 

00:12:50
MARSHA LINEHAN You make Cuban coffee? 

00:12:50
CHANTAL Yes. 

00:12:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, and then what do you? 

00:12:50
CHANTAL And I sit on the couch with my coffee and I turn on CNN and I look at magazines while I have my coffee. 

00:13:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. And then, uh, so how long would you say you do that for? 

00:13:05
CHANTAL I would say that making the coffee and the whole thing probably 25, 30 minutes. 

00:13:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so if you were up at 7:30, by 8 o’clock you’ve drank your coffee, watched CNN and read your magazines. 

00:13:20
CHANTAL Yes. 

00:13:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so now it’s 8:00, and you’ve got two hours to get to church. But when would you have to leave the house to get there -- to get church on time? 

00:13:30
CHANTAL I should be in my car at 9:15 at the latest. 

00:13:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:13:30
CHANTAL Because ideally I should be getting there a little bit earlier you know that I’m.. 

00:13:35
MARSHA LINEHAN That’d be -- that’d be very good if you got there early, but we’ll just work on being on time. 

00:13:45
CHANTAL Okay. 

00:13:45
MARSHA LINEHAN So, I mean can we -- 

00:13:45
CHANTAL So, 9:15. 

00:13:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, can we guarantee you would actually be church on time if you left the house at 9:15? 

00:13:50
CHANTAL Yes. 

00:13:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So, between 8 o’clock and 9:15, how is that that you don’t make it into the car at 9:15? Give me the blow-by-blow here what happens. 

00:14:00
CHANTAL Because, I think I -- I -- I underestimate the amount of time -- the time that takes me to get ready. So, I think I have time to work out and then I start to work out. 

00:14:10
MARSHA LINEHAN So in other words, so usually what happens is you think, oh, well, I don’t have to be there? Do you think like, oh, well, I don’t have to.. 

00:14:20
CHANTAL Like I think if it’s 8 o’clock, I’ll think I could work out until 8:30 and then get in the shower at 8:30 and get ready in 45 minutes. 

00:14:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:14:30
CHANTAL But that doesn’t happen. 

00:14:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Is that -- is that reasonable -- so you don’t -- do work-out until 8:30? 

00:14:35
CHANTAL Yes. 

00:14:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so you work out till 8:30. 

00:14:35
CHANTAL Hmmm. 

00:14:35
MARSHA LINEHAN And now its 8:30 and you’re 45 minutes to get shower and dressed. 

00:14:40
CHANTAL Hmmm. 

00:14:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, well, let’s say, you have 45 minutes to get in the car. 

00:14:45
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:14:45
MARSHA LINEHAN And you’re ready to go. 

00:14:45
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:14:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So, what is it in the 45 minutes is creating a problem? 

00:14:50
CHANTAL It takes me longer than 45 minutes to get ready. 

00:14:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so what part of it takes you longer? 

00:14:55
CHANTAL One of the blow joints, straighten my hair. 

00:15:00
MARSHA LINEHAN In other words, you wash your hair on Sunday morning? 

00:15:00
CHANTAL Every day. 

00:15:00
MARSHA LINEHAN You wash your hair every morning? 

00:15:05
CHANTAL Yes. 

00:15:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so if you gave up washing your hair on Sunday mornings, would you be at church on time? 

00:15:10
CHANTAL I -- I -- yes, but I wouldn’t want to do that, because I have to look good too. 

00:15:15
MARSHA LINEHAN You have to or you want to? 

00:15:15
CHANTAL I want to. 

00:15:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So, in other words, you wouldn’t want to sacrifice your hair for being on time. I radically accept it, listen there's no problem, why should she do that? We’ll find something else to sacrifice. Okay, so then, uhm, what else -- so how long does washing your hair and drying it take? 

00:15:40
CHANTAL 30 minutes. 

00:15:40
MARSHA LINEHAN 30 minutes. It’s only a problem when we’re trying to get in a car at 9:15. 

00:15:45
CHANTAL Yeah. 

00:15:45
MARSHA LINEHAN So, we’ve got 8:30, so now that’s 9 o’clock. 

00:15:50
CHANTAL Yeah. 

00:15:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:15:50
CHANTAL I could do a ponytail that’s shorter, that’s great, I did this morning. 

00:15:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so 9 o’clock, you’ve now got 15 minutes to get dressed and get in the car. 

00:16:00
CHANTAL Yeah, which is not enough. 

00:16:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Now, given that, more than likely you’ve known if there is a problem in the schedule, we’re dealing on time... 

00:16:10
CHANTAL Yeah, I don’t why, but I bargain with myself and it -- like, oh no know that if I have to leave at 9:15, I really need to be in the shower by 8:15 at the latest. But, then I bargain with myself. 

00:16:25
MARSHA LINEHAN What’s the bargain? 

00:16:25
CHANTAL I just say, oh, no, I could get ready faster, let me work out a little more or let me read this magazine a little more or let me do these emails. So, I -- I try to get most of it done. 

00:16:35
MARSHA LINEHAN So in other words the -- so in other words the problem is, is that you consistently tell yourself that you can do things faster than it’s actually the case. 

00:16:45
CHANTAL Yes. 

00:16:45
MARSHA LINEHAN And since you know that you do that and you know that in fact you can’t do that... 

00:16:50
CHANTAL That’s the question. 

00:16:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Do you have any thoughts on what’s going on? 

00:16:55
CHANTAL No, that’s the question. 

00:16:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:16:55
CHANTAL So, I -- I see that, like I know that I do that and I still do it. 

00:17:00
MARSHA LINEHAN So, have you made any rules for yourself that you haven’t capped. Like, have you ever said, okay, no more working out in the morning on Sundays? 

00:17:10
CHANTAL In reference to that... 

00:17:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

00:17:10
CHANTAL Have I made any rules other than setting the time? 

00:17:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, have you made any promises other than -- it sounds to me, is it that you’ve made promises to yourself that you’ll get in the car at 9:15 or do you make promises yourself that you will cut something out of your routine? 

00:17:25
CHANTAL No, I make a promise to myself that I’m gonna get in the shower at a certain time. 

00:17:25
MARSHA LINEHAN What time? 

00:17:30
CHANTAL 8:15. 

00:17:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, but then you don’t do it? 

00:17:30
CHANTAL Correct. 

00:17:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So, when -- or of course you couldn’t, if at 8:00, you decide to do a half an hour exercise? 

00:17:40
CHANTAL Right. If it’s 8 o’clock, then I should just decide to cut out the exercise. 

00:17:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Or do 15 minutes. 

00:17:50
CHANTAL Or do 15 minutes. 

00:17:50
MARSHA LINEHAN So, what could you do in 15 minutes? 

00:17:50
CHANTAL I could -- 

00:17:50
MARSHA LINEHAN First of all, are you willing to cut off the exercise? 

00:17:55
CHANTAL Yes, I mean I can cut out the exercise on Sundays. 

00:18:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so that’s not a major loss. 

00:18:00
CHANTAL No. 

00:18:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So, are you willing to do that? And can we make an agreement right here in front of all these people? 

00:18:10
CHANTAL Yes, but I’m worried that I’ll find something else to replace the exercise. I don’t know, I -- maybe I like to stay home like I want to stay home, I don’t want to go anywhere. And it’s not just Sunday, but maybe I don’t have enough -- I work too much and don’t have enough time in home and then when I’m home in the morning... 

00:18:35
MARSHA LINEHAN You’re start thinking these sorts of thoughts, I deserve to be home, I like to be home, I wanna be home, it’s wonderful to be home. 

00:18:45
CHANTAL Maybe. 

00:18:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Maybe.. 

00:18:45
CHANTAL Yeah, I’m not really aware that I’m thinking that. 

00:18:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, then if you’re not aware, take it from me, you’re not doing it. And there’s no such thing as unaware thoughts, okay. 

00:18:55
CHANTAL Okay. 

00:18:55
MARSHA LINEHAN If you’re thinking it, you’re thinking it, alright. But, I -- so what happens when you’re 15 minutes late by the way? What’s the consequence? 

00:19:05
CHANTAL There hasn’t been a consequence, but.. 

00:19:05
MARSHA LINEHAN That’s the problem. 

00:19:10
CHANTAL Well, we won’t show this video to my boyfriend. Uhm, no, I just think its bad. 

00:19:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Actually that would be a very thoughtful thing to do. 

00:19:20
CHANTAL To show him the video? 

00:19:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

00:19:20
CHANTAL No, I’m sure I will. 

00:19:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Yes. 

00:19:25
CHANTAL But I -- I feel that it’s, uhm -- it’s by in its -- you know, if he -- if I was giving a lecture every Sunday morning and he was late, I would be insulted by that. 

00:19:35
MARSHA LINEHAN So, in other words, a violation of moral values, but you haven’t been punished by anyone else. 

00:19:40
CHANTAL No. 

00:19:40
MARSHA LINEHAN So, you’re boyfriend has never said a word about it? 

00:19:45
CHANTAL No. 

00:19:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So, part of your problem is there’s really not a consequence other than, uh, your moral values are being violated slightly. 

00:19:50
CHANTAL Yeah. 

00:19:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. And that’s a delayed problem. 

00:19:55
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:19:55
MARSHA LINEHAN And since you’re telling yourself the whole time that you really will get ready on time You haven’t been able to use that to get it to go backwards in time so to speak and mobilize your behavior. 

00:20:05
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:20:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So -- so it’s clear just from listening to you that the actual problem is that you pay attention to what you’re thinking in the morning when you say to yourself I can do this and dress faster, right? 

00:20:30
CHANTAL What do you mean? 

00:20:30
MARSHA LINEHAN If I could get you to stop listening to yourself, that what you habitually do... 

00:20:30
CHANTAL Oh! 

00:20:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Is save yourself.. 

00:20:35
CHANTAL Yes. 

00:20:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Or just dress faster. 

00:20:35
CHANTAL Yes. 

00:20:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. And then not only do you say it, but you actually believe it... 

00:20:40
CHANTAL Yes. 

00:20:40
MARSHA LINEHAN At the time. 

00:20:40
CHANTAL Which seems silly, because consistently I demonstrate that it’s not true. 

00:20:45
MARSHA LINEHAN It’s obviously not true. Okay, that seems clear to me. 

00:20:50
CHANTAL I know. 

00:20:50
MARSHA LINEHAN If it actually takes you half an hour to do your hair and you’re not willing to not do your hair, right? 

00:21:00
CHANTAL I mean, once in a while I can do a ponytail... 

00:21:00
MARSHA LINEHAN I would like to say the following, so what happened if you said yourself that, if I’m not in the shower by 8:30, no 8:15... 

00:21:10
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:21:10
MARSHA LINEHAN I just can’t wash my hair. 

00:21:15
[sil.] 

00:21:20
CHANTAL Yeah, that’s a big consequence. So, how do I discipline myself to do that? 

00:21:30
MARSHA LINEHAN You won’t be able to do it on your own. You’re gonna have to get somebody to help you, namely your boyfriend or a girlfriend. 

00:21:35
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:21:35
MARSHA LINEHAN I mean, you could get anybody to help. 

00:21:40
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:21:40
MARSHA LINEHAN You know, because, uhm, but a -- a smarter move to give -- the trick would be to say to yourself, uhm -- do you really wanna be on time? 

00:21:50
CHANTAL I do wanna be on time. 

00:21:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:21:55
CHANTAL Well, I do want to be on time because I think that that would be the right thing to do. 

00:22:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Hmmm-mm. 

00:22:00
CHANTAL But I don’t know that it’s particularly important to me to be on time. 

00:22:05
MARSHA LINEHAN It’s not important to you... 

00:22:05
CHANTAL I wanna do it for him. 

00:22:05
MARSHA LINEHAN You wanna do it, because you love him? 

00:22:10
CHANTAL Yes. 

00:22:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so the first thing we do is ask him if he cares. 

00:22:15
CHANTAL I think he does. 

00:22:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, I -- why do you think that when he hadn’t said anything? 

00:22:20
CHANTAL I just think he’s trying to be nice and not put pressure on me. 

00:22:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Hmmm-mm. 

00:22:25
CHANTAL But I don’t think it’s good for him, for his congregants to be noticing them late for... 

00:22:30
MARSHA LINEHAN So, what would happen if you asked him? Don’t you think it would help you get yourself there on time if he actually told you he cared? 

00:22:35
CHANTAL Yeah, maybe. 

00:22:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Because that would make it more visible to you. 

00:22:40
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:22:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:22:40
CHANTAL That’s true. 

00:22:45
MARSHA LINEHAN So, one thing I would suggest is asking him if he cares. 

00:22:45
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:22:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Uhm, the only other thing -- right now, it seems to me that the only way to get yourself to be on time is to make up a series of rules for yourself where you say, you’re not allowed anymore to be believe that you can wash your hair and get ready faster. 

00:23:10
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:23:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Because that seems to be the one area that you’re probably unlikely to cut back on no matter what. 

00:23:15
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:23:15
MARSHA LINEHAN And the real problem has been -- is that you get yourself from the shower too late. 

00:23:20
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:23:20
MARSHA LINEHAN And you’re not willing to not wash your hair and do all the things to get dressed. 

00:23:25
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:23:25
MARSHA LINEHAN In other words you’re not really to look unattractive at church. 

00:23:25
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. And so, should I just talk back to myself. So... 

00:23:35
MARSHA LINEHAN One thing you do is ask your husband whether he would rather have you on time unattractive or late attractive. 

00:23:40
CHANTAL Well, I know what he’s gonna say, he‘s going to say I’m always attractive, 'cos he is so sweet. But -- so should I talk back to myself and just when I say, uh, I can get in the shower at 8:30 and still1 make it and then answer myself back and say, no, no, that’s not true, you know that’s not true. 

00:24:00
MARSHA LINEHAN The only way I can think of to do is, you -- you know, generally, what you have to -- consequences control behavior and you don’t have consequences that will control you. And your self-talk hasn’t controlled you either, because that -- so therefore you need to have some regimen when you basically -- if I were you, I’d consider maybe putting an alarm clock or an alarm somewhere. 

00:24:20
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:24:20
MARSHA LINEHAN That rings at 8:15, that basically says, no matter what you’re doing, when the alarm goes off, you get in the shower. 

00:24:25
CHANTAL That is a good idea. 

00:24:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Because that way, you can talk to yourself as much as you want to and -- and pay attention to it even, but the key thing would be to say, if the alarm rings, I have to get into the shower. 

00:24:40
CHANTAL Hmmm. 

00:24:40
MARSHA LINEHAN And -- but the other thing you have to work on, ‘cos your real problem is you don’t have a consequence either. In other words, you feel bad about it, but your husband doesn’t appear to care and all the congregations talking about it is not an actually important thing to you to be there on time. You just wanna do something nice for your husband, who doesn’t appear to care. 

00:25:00
CHANTAL No, I’m sure he does care though. 

00:25:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Hmmm-mm, I’d ask him. 

00:25:05
CHANTAL Okay. 

00:25:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Because your -- other thing you could do is put a big picture of your husband out, if you really think he cares or you could get him to write a note saying, I care and while you’d be on time. What would happen if you got a phone call saying I want you to be on time? 

00:25:30
CHANTAL I think I would make much more of an effort. 

00:25:30
MARSHA LINEHAN You would what? 

00:25:30
CHANTAL I would make much more of an effort than I do now. 

00:25:35
MARSHA LINEHAN No -- yes -- your problem isn’t that you’re not making an effort, your problem is that you listen to yourself when you tell yourself you have time. 

00:25:45
CHANTAL Yeah. 

00:25:45
MARSHA LINEHAN I mean that’s the problem. There's a very simple problem. You say to yourself I can do that quickly when you can’t. 

00:25:50
CHANTAL Okay. 

00:25:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so you’ve sold yourself on that particular idea. 

00:25:55
CHANTAL Okay. 

00:25:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so the main thing you have to do is start believing that and then you have to say to yourself you’ll act as if you don’t believe him. Now, I’m gonna stop for a moment. If I were your therapist right now, I would come up with different plans and then I’d be the one checking him. 

00:26:15
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:26:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So, I would check did you do that. 

00:26:15
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:26:15
MARSHA LINEHAN But the key thing that you really have to do is put a consequence on yourself for not following. 

00:26:20
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:26:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Whatever your plan is, you can do the alarm clock, you can do the talking to yourself and saying, no, that’s not true. 

00:26:25
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:26:30
MARSHA LINEHAN You can say that if I come to the next evolution, Marsha will look me up and ask me what happened. I mean, you know, you could give me your name and email, and I’ll email you to see what happened. In other words, in a sense, uhm, self-talk is -- a plan is gonna work when you’ve got somebody else who cares about it at the end and there’s a consequence for not doing it, even going home and telling your husband about this and saying, I wanna be on time, I've agreed to do this, I’m going to do this and I want you to ask me if I did it. 

00:27:05
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:27:05
MARSHA LINEHAN More in the likelihood would have effect, don’t you think? 

00:27:10
CHANTAL Hmmm-mm. 

00:27:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Has this been helpful at all? 

00:27:10
CHANTAL Yes. 

00:27:10
MARSHA LINEHAN How so? 

00:27:15
CHANTAL Uhm, I think it just showed me that if I just discipline myself and do what I know to be true rather than what I’m trying to convince myself off in the morning. So, in the morning, I try to convince myself that I can do things in a shorter amount of time than I know. And so if I don’t listen to that, and do what I know is true, which is that I need to go in the shower at 8:15 and I like your idea of the alarm clock. I think that’s good. 

00:27:45
MARSHA LINEHAN So, put an alarm on you. 

00:27:45
CHANTAL Yeah. 

00:27:45
MARSHA LINEHAN The trick is to put some consequences in, but your real problem is, is that you don’t have a -- if you’re in charge of the consequences, you’ll just skip the consequences. 

00:27:55
CHANTAL Of course. 

00:27:55
MARSHA LINEHAN That’s the problem. 

00:28:00
CHANTAL But, so, I have trouble also getting sometimes to my -- which is terrible, to my 9 ‘o clock patient. 

00:28:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Do me a favor, to start over and drop the "it's terrible." 

00:28:05
CHANTAL Okay, I have trouble sometimes getting to my 9 o’clock patient. 

00:28:10
MARSHA LINEHAN But doing the same -- engaging in the same sets of behaviors. 

00:28:15
CHANTAL I think so, yeah. Sometimes during the week also just difficulty getting out of bed. So an hour earlier, so just difficulty I snooze the alarm like ten times. 

00:28:35
MARSHA LINEHAN So the one thing you can do there is pros and cons. 

00:28:40
CHANTAL Hmmm-hmm. 

00:28:40
MARSHA LINEHAN And in fact you could do it on all of these times. 

00:28:45
CHANTAL Hmmm-hmm. 

00:28:45
MARSHA LINEHAN You could do pros and cons, like when I don’t want to get up in the morning, when I was on my session, I had to get up at 5. And we had to be in our places five minutes before 5:30. So I can either get up at five, and not get any coffee before I went or be rushing around would be miserable or I could get up a little bit earlier and be relaxed. So, I wake up earlier and say, you want to be relaxed, do you want to be rushing? And I do pros and cons of both and mostly I’ve always get up because I think, oh, well, there is a little suffering now just to save me from a lot of suffering later namely, having to rush. 

00:29:20
CHANTAL Right. 

00:29:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so one thing you could practice is, some pros and cons, is it really in your -- is it worth it to you? How bad do you feel when you’re late? 

00:29:30
CHANTAL I feel bad. 

00:29:30
MARSHA LINEHAN ... to any of these things. 

00:29:30
CHANTAL Well, no -- 

00:29:35
MARSHA LINEHAN I mean for how long. 

00:29:35
CHANTAL I don’t feel bad when I am late to church, but I may feel bad when I'm late for a for a patient, that I felt bad. 

00:29:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Hmmm, hmm. Well, how often are you late? 

00:29:45
CHANTAL Maybe like once every other week. 

00:29:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Do your patients get upset about it? 

00:29:55
CHANTAL Not really. 

00:30:00
MARSHA LINEHAN See, your -- part of your problem, your life is -- you must be a super nice person. You don’t seem to have a lot of native consequences for anything, you know, are you on a treatment team? 

00:30:10
CHANTAL No, I am in private practice. 

00:30:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, that’s too bad because if you're on a team, so you could get your team to shape you up right away. Probably -- a lot of your problem is that really you’re not consequences for what you’re doing. 

00:30:20
CHANTAL Yeah. 

00:30:20
MARSHA LINEHAN And so, what you need to do is, if you’re going to have, the only person you can give consequences right at the moment is gonna be you. 

00:30:30
CHANTAL Hmmm-hmm. 

00:30:30
MARSHA LINEHAN And discipline is not the way to do it. That’s the way of saying, I’ll try harder, which if that was gonna work, it would have worked by now, I guarantee you. 

00:30:35
CHANTAL Hmmm-hmm. 

00:30:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, 'cos, I am sure you’ve already done the, I’ll try harder part. 

00:30:40
CHANTAL How do I impose a consequence on myself? 

00:30:40
MARSHA LINEHAN You do pros and cons -- 

00:30:45
CHANTAL Okay. 

00:30:45
MARSHA LINEHAN You remind yourself in the time of what the consequences are, that I am going to feel bad about my self if I do this. 

00:30:50
CHANTAL That morning? 

00:30:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

00:30:50
CHANTAL Okay. 

00:30:50
MARSHA LINEHAN When you get up, you remind yourself, instead of saying, I have to do this, I have to do this, you say, okay, my choice is, I can either do it or not do it. And if I don’t do it, here is how I am gonna feel later. Is it really worth it to read two more pages in my magazine? 

00:31:05
CHANTAL Right. 

00:31:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Do I -- is two pages worthwhile, what’s coming in my way in the future. 

00:31:10
CHANTAL Right. 

00:31:10
MARSHA LINEHAN So, part of what you have to do is, bring your future into your present. Is five more minutes in bed worth feeling bad later on, for being late with my client. 

00:31:20
CHANTAL Hmmm-hmm. 

00:31:20
MARSHA LINEHAN And do in effect in your mind a pros and cons. 

00:31:20
CHANTAL Okay. 

00:31:20
MARSHA LINEHAN And so, practice the pros and cons in bed to get yourself out. 

00:31:25
CHANTAL Yeah. 

00:31:25
MARSHA LINEHAN And practice your pros and cons when you’re getting ready to go exercise. If you were me and I were you, I would just make a rule of no exercise, but you're probably right, I think you'll find a new magazine to read. 

00:31:40
CHANTAL Yeah, plus I want to exercise, I've more energy if I exercise in the morning. 

00:31:40
MARSHA LINEHAN You tell yourself that, I’ll have more energy... 

00:31:45
CHANTAL No, well I -- 

00:31:45
MARSHA LINEHAN ...to dress faster. 

00:31:45
CHANTAL No, no. Not to dress faster, but just for my day. 

00:31:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

00:31:50
CHANTAL No, I really do have more energy for my day. 

00:31:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, okay, so here is the deal though, one the real consequence, I would say, then would be -- 

00:31:55
CHANTAL The hair I think -- 

00:32:00
MARSHA LINEHAN It’s the hair. 

00:32:00
CHANTAL I think -- 

00:32:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:32:00
CHANTAL Yeah. 

00:32:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so you could just say, in the shower, 8.15 wash your hair, not in there, don’t wash it. that I'll get you in. 

00:32:10
CHANTAL Yeah. I will. 

00:32:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, you wanna make a deal? 

00:32:10
CHANTAL Sure. 

00:32:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Are you gonna come back in two years? 

00:32:15
CHANTAL I am sorry to the conference? 

00:32:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Coming to evolution or -- okay. 

00:32:15
CHANTAL Yeah, since two years now. 

00:32:20
MARSHA LINEHAN More than likely. I think in -- what is it five years? 

00:32:20
CHANTAL Five years. 

00:32:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, okay. Well, good. 

00:32:25
CHANTAL Maybe you can mail me if you want. 

00:32:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Oh, no, I want you to e-mail me. 

00:32:25
CHANTAL Okay. 

00:32:30
MARSHA LINEHAN In two weeks. 

00:32:30
CHANTAL In two weeks? 

00:32:30
MARSHA LINEHAN And tell me -- well maybe a month. 

00:32:30
CHANTAL Okay. 

00:32:30
MARSHA LINEHAN That will give you four Sundays. 

00:32:35
CHANTAL Okay. 

00:32:35
MARSHA LINEHAN And tell me whether you really got on time. But the key thing is, if you decide to do this, let me tell you something, don’t give yourself any grief at all. Believe me, not washing your hair is enough pain. And you have -- when you do consequences to change your own behavior, you have to let the consequences do the work. 

00:32:55
CHANTAL Hmmm-hmmm. 

00:32:55
MARSHA LINEHAN There is no point, you don’t have to let anything else work. 

00:33:00
CHANTAL I was going to ask you -- if I could ask you a question? 

00:33:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

00:33:00
CHANTAL I don’t remember what word I used, maybe terrible. When I -- 

00:33:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

00:33:05
CHANTAL And you told me not to use that. Why? 

00:33:10
MARSHA LINEHAN 'cos it was judgmental of yourself. This is terrible, I am terrible. 

00:33:15
CHANTAL And how is it counterproductive for me to be judgmental of myself? 

00:33:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Because then your -- once we start judging ourselves, we start avoiding ourselves. 

00:33:20
CHANTAL Oh! that’s good. 

00:33:25
MARSHA LINEHAN So, I always try to help you, which is drop the judgment, start over. So, you had to practice same things without the judgment. 

00:33:30
CHANTAL Yeah. 

00:33:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:33:35
CHANTAL Okay. 

00:33:35
MARSHA LINEHAN So, okay. So, now stop the role-play, okay? 

00:33:40
CHANTAL Okay. 

00:33:40
MARSHA LINEHAN So, how did you -- well, we're in a role-play, of course was it. okay, -- but stop this, stop this still thing. Okay, so we’re now back to being participants, okay. So, how did you feel about the entire interaction with me? First did you feel judged by me? 

00:33:55
CHANTAL No. 

00:33:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So any other thoughts about it? 

00:34:00
CHANTAL Yeah, I felt like you’re genuinely interested in helping me solve my problem. And you were very like oriented to finding very matter-of-factly where the problem is occurring and what the solution is that’s gonna work for me. 

00:34:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So the rule of thumb, I’ll say this to the audience, the basic rule of life, when you start a chain analysis is never say why. You just need to erase the word, why, from your vocabulary. So you don't say, why are you late? You say, give me the blow by blow what led up to it, what happened, give me all the events. You get a description of the events, but you never ask why. It’s why almost all way. First of all, no one knows why and secondly it’s almost always comes across as judgmental, like why did you do that? Okay, anything else you want to say to me or the audience? 

00:34:50
CHANTAL No, it was just very helpful, I appreciate it. 

00:34:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, good. 

00:34:55
CHANTAL Thank you. 

00:34:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Thank you so much. 

00:35:00
[sil.] 

00:35:05
MARSHA LINEHAN To be perfectly frank with you, I can’t remember when I am supposed to stop. Am I supposed to stop now? 

00:35:10
UNKNOWN No. 

00:35:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh no, what time do I stop? 

00:35:15
UNKNOWN 4:50. 

00:35:15
MARSHA LINEHAN 4:50, so I have a little more time. So do you want to question the answer, or do another chain analysis? Okay, friend, where are you? Where is my other person? What happened to him? 

00:35:30
GREG I am right here. 

00:35:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, there you are. Oh, fabulous. 

00:35:35
GREG (inaudible ) 

00:35:38
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:35:38
GREG Alright. 

00:35:38
MARSHA LINEHAN Alright. Your name again? 

00:35:40
GREG I am Greg. 

00:35:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Greg, Hi, Greg. Marsha. Okay, Greg, have your seat. Okay, so, tell me -- wait a minute, let me get seated. Okay, okay, Greg -- 

00:35:50
GREG Sorry about that. 

00:35:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, me too. Thank you. So, what’s the problem behavior that we're working on? 

00:35:55
GREG You know, my problem primarily is that, I am avoiding writing. I’ve got a project actually that I am working on with somebody. So I am collaborating with somebody about a project and I am not -- I go entire weeks without writing anything often. And then sometimes I do, I have little spurts, but my goal is to do a 30 minutes a day, and I am not doing that, instead I just keep avoiding it. 

00:36:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So you’re supposed to write 30 minutes a day on whatever project it is? 

00:36:30
GREG Yeah. 

00:36:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. And is this a project you really want to do? 

00:36:30
GREG Yeah, it actually is. 

00:36:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, and do you want to -- do you actually want to get writing done? 

00:36:40
GREG Yes. 

00:36:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Do you enjoy writing when you’re doing it? Or is it that you hate it, I mean, some people enjoy the writing, but they can’t get themselves to start, and other people can’t stand it. And therefore don’t start. 

00:36:50
GREG That’s a good question because -- it’s a good question because sometimes I really enjoy, but I think I get locked in, like my own judgment about my writing or this doesn’t sound good, this doesn’t sound good. And then I’ll just pull away. But when I am in the groove and I am just writing things down then I -- then it just goes, and I really enjoy quite a bit 'cos then I can be very opinionated, you know, and have a place to put it. 

00:37:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, so let me ask you something though, is the problem that don’t start to write or is the problem that you start and stop before you have hours up? 

00:37:25
GREG You know what -- no, the problem is that I don’t start. 

00:37:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:37:30
GREG That is actually the problem. 

00:37:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. And do you have a specific time everyday when you're supposed to do this? 

00:37:35
GREG That’s another great question. I did intend. I could tell you about all the avoidance. No, typically I'd like to do in the morning before I get up, before I go to work out. 

00:37:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Before you get up, you want to -- 

00:37:45
GREG No, no, no before – that would be ideal though. No, I actually tried to do it after I get up, but before I go to work out. 

00:38:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Now, is that a smart move? Okay, so, is that a wise plan? Is that a realistic wise plan? Get up and before you go work out that you would sit down for half an hour right, is that a wise plan? 

00:38:10
GREG You know the reason, I don’t know whether it’s wise or not. The reasoning behind that was, because when I was giving myself larger blocks of time, I thought perhaps that was what was I was avoiding. And -- and I have another time I do it on Mondays, I get home from teaching thing that I do. And then I have the conference call with her to talk about, you know, what we're doing. And so, I have a gap there that two hours, but sometimes I can just eat that entire two hours, just doing.. 

00:38:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so let me ask you something, do you have a history of writing blogs in the past? What’s your degree? 

00:38:55
GREG Ph.D. 

00:38:55
MARSHA LINEHAN So you’ve done it dissertation? 

00:38:55
GREG Yes. 

00:38:55
MARSHA LINEHAN So, you’ve actually solved this problem once in your, in your life before.. 

00:38:55
GREG I have. 

00:39:00
MARSHA LINEHAN At least once. 

00:39:00
GREG Honestly, yes, yeah. 

00:39:00
MARSHA LINEHAN And how did you solve this down? 

00:39:00
GREG You know what, I tried every behavioral principle I could. And I organized my life pretty much around doing my dissertation at the time. And I would do things, like I’d set up all kinds of consequences I couldn’t go out, on the weekend I lived in Austin, Texas, so I couldn’t go water-skiing, I couldn’t go out to party. I couldn’t do anything unless I’ve done a certain amount of writing each night, and I do -- I wouldn’t even allow myself to watch TV, which actually and I think about it that might be a good idea. I wouldn’t even allow myself to watch TV until I completed something that I did a Premack principle. 

00:39:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so and -- interestingly you haven’t tried this strategy again. 

00:39:45
GREG No, interesting, yes. 

00:39:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, what’s getting in the way. It sounds like that worked, right? 

00:39:50
GREG It worked very well. 

00:39:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Hmmmm. 

00:39:55
GREG It took myself a long time to ramp up to be as it worked very well. The -- 

00:40:05
MARSHA LINEHAN So, in other words, the pressure to do the writing right now is not as great as the pressure was to get the dissertation done? 

00:40:10
GREG Exactly right. 

00:40:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Alright. And so, you can... 

00:40:15
GREG It’s like people breathing down my neck more. 

00:40:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, and you can actually manage your weekly call and somehow have a good call, even though you haven’t done a thing since the time before... 

00:40:20
GREG Yeah. 

00:40:25
MARSHA LINEHAN How do you manage that? 

00:40:25
GREG Because -- often because I can just talk about things, well, you know, I didn’t do anything. But you know here are some ideas I have and dah, dah, dah and oh yeah, that’s good. 

00:40:40
MARSHA LINEHAN For you're just like the last person, no consequences. 

00:40:45
GREG I know, I was listening to that and I thought, oh, my god, my future fiancé, I just couldn’t the whole thing yeah. I was thinking maybe I got to get her to give me more of a consequence on the other end is exactly that I was thinking. 

00:41:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Who is the her? 

00:41:00
GREG The one that I am writing with. 

00:41:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh with -- you met a woman you was getting married to the pressure, you two can maybe get together as friends and have a friendly... 

00:41:10
GREG On the phone... 

00:41:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so here is the deal. So what happens, so, you get up in the morning actually, let’s look at this, so... 

00:41:15
GREG Okay. 

00:41:15
MARSHA LINEHAN So, when you get up and you go exercise, you’re supposed to do this before you exercise, right? 

00:41:20
GREG Yes. 

00:41:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Half and hour. 

00:41:25
GREG Yes. 

00:41:25
MARSHA LINEHAN And that’s a reasonable plan in the sense of your job and time and when you had to be places, right? 

00:41:30
GREG Yes. 

00:41:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, and so you don’t have to get up like earlier than you would want to in order to do this? 

00:41:35
GREG No. 

00:41:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So what time do you get up? 

00:41:35
GREG 8 ‘o clock. 

00:41:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, oh, gosh, oh, wonderful. Okay, 8 o’clock and when do you usually go exercise? 

00:41:45
GREG 9:30. 

00:41:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. And then what do you do -- so what happens between 8 o’ clock and 9:30 that eliminates half an hour writing? 

00:41:55
GREG You know, good question, because I think I get up and make the bed and go downstairs, have something to, you know, eat and get my clothes on and gosh, check e-mail I think. I think e-mail might be a big thing that I get stuck in. And then first around I look at the paper. So e-mail and paper and now that you think about... 

00:42:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so look, let me just ask you something. Do you have another -- you know, the question is, why sacrifice this for writing? I mean, that’s an enjoyable time you get up, you have an hour and a half to get dressed, let's take half an hour for dressing, you have an hour of just very relaxed time, which you would have to sacrifice to get this writing done. 

00:42:45
GREG Right. 

00:42:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Alright. So why sacrifice it? So, look again, is -- what’s your job? 

00:42:50
GREG A psychologist. 

00:42:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Where? 

00:42:50
GREG Oh, private practice. 

00:42:50
MARSHA LINEHAN So, you see patients all day. 

00:42:55
GREG Yep. 

00:42:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, so you can’t writing during the day. 

00:42:55
GREG No. 

00:42:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, heaven, it's too bad. So, here is the deal though. That would be one patient a day that you have to give up to write... 

00:43:05
GREG Yes. 

00:43:05
MARSHA LINEHAN ...at work. It would be worth it? How much money would you lose? Well, don’t say that out loud, but.. 

00:43:10
GREG Ahhh. When I give up one patient, yeah, that's tough because that's my income. 

00:43:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:43:20
GREG That’s a good question. 

00:43:20
MARSHA LINEHAN So, how about if you gave up your working out to write. 

00:43:25
GREG I wouldn’t do that. How about that? 

00:43:25
MARSHA LINEHAN How about that. I like that thinking. So, in other words, if you made the consequence of not writing that you couldn’t work out, you probably would write. 

00:43:35
GREG Wow. 

00:43:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Working out for you is like washing your hair for our friend. 

00:43:45
GREG It is -- it is like washing my hair, yes. I don’t like to go a day without it. But I do. That’s a good one 'cos that would be a consequence that I wouldn’t like, that’s interesting. 

00:44:00
MARSHA LINEHAN You like that thinking. Here is my point, you -- the only way to get yourself to do something that you don’t want to do for a long range consequence, is to put a short range consequence then. 

00:44:10
GREG Yeah. 

00:44:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Because your problem is, your consequence for this is long-term, it’s weak and you don’t get a consequence talking to your friend. And you’re not gonna be able to get a friend that start getting irritated with you if she is not irritated now. 

00:44:25
GREG That’s right. 

00:44:25
MARSHA LINEHAN You know, you may destroy the friendship in the end by not getting anything written and making her have to do all the writing. 

00:44:30
GREG Right. 

00:44:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Just to remind you this little detail. 

00:44:30
GREG Right. 

00:44:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. And you could write that in your mind yourself. 

00:44:35
GREG Right. 

00:44:35
MARSHA LINEHAN That is not helpful long-term friendships, not to do your part. 

00:44:40
GREG That’s right. 

00:44:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Do you think of those thoughts by the way? 

00:44:45
GREG Yes, I do. Yes I do. 

00:44:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, and they don't help. 

00:44:45
GREG You know I’ve been slightly aided by the fact, she also runs into, you know, things. So, I guess, I think we support each other in our bad behavior... 

00:44:55
MARSHA LINEHAN So, I see the two of you wants to getting... 

00:44:55
GREG I probably shouldn’t have said that. 

00:45:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, alright. 

00:45:00
GREG We both wash our hair. 

00:45:00
MARSHA LINEHAN So, here is the deal, if she doesn’t write, do you -- what's the incentive actually if you have to do it, if she is not doing it. I mean seriously, why, why not just say, when she is writing, I will start writing, 'cos my guess is, if she were writing something -- tell me if this is true, she were writing something every week, and tell you what’s she had written, do you think that that would mobilize you, start getting some for instance. 

00:45:20
GREG Yeah, yeah, probably it would. 

00:45:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:45:20
GREG Probably it would, because then I’d feel guilty, I don’t like to be the one underperforming. 

00:45:30
MARSHA LINEHAN Right. Okay. So why don’t we just give up on this? 

00:45:35
GREG Oh, no. 

00:45:35
MARSHA LINEHAN I mean seriously. I mean, seriously why not just give up on it until she starts writing. I mean, why bother? 

00:45:45
[sil.] 

00:45:50
GREG You know, I wonder what this -- that I’ve got a real struggle in my head 'cos I really don’t want to give up on it. I see that might be better in some way, but... 

00:46:05
MARSHA LINEHAN No, I mean, I think you either ought to give up on it or unfortunately we’re not gonna be able to get your friend probably 'cos she is not here to change her behavior. 

00:46:15
GREG Right. 

00:46:15
MARSHA LINEHAN And so, the only options you've got in front of you or because it sounds like what you’re doing, is you’re getting up and doing enjoyable things -- by the way, do you think about writing in the morning? does the thought come into your mind? I should write, I supposed to write. 

00:46:30
GREG Yeah, yeah, but sometimes I think it doesn’t 'cos I’ve mastered the avoidance so much, yeah. 

00:46:35
MARSHA LINEHAN And when it does come into your what happens? 

00:46:40
GREG When it really comes up is, when I have two hour block that I specifically, you know, as I am not rushing off to go anywhere because and I know I’ve the call at 3 o’clock. So -- 

00:46:50
MARSHA LINEHAN What about, what’s this two hours? 

00:46:50
GREG Oh, that’s on Monday I have a call -- we have our phone call at 3 o’clock to actually talk. 

00:46:55
MARSHA LINEHAN So you have a call at 3 ‘clock and what you have a two hours before that? 

00:47:00
GREG Yeah, available. 

00:47:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, what would be easier, to get yourself to work for that two hours as four half hours by the way. 

00:47:05
GREG Yeah. 

00:47:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Then or to work on figuring out a way to get yourself to work in the mornings. 

00:47:15
GREG That would probably be easier because of the just getting up and mobilizing in the morning. 

00:47:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, mainly because my guess is, if you’re seeing patients all day, what do you do in the evenings? 

00:47:30
GREG Yeah, I don’t get home until about 9:30, 10 o’clock, so I just, you know, eat and then... 

00:47:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Go to bed. 

00:47:35
GREG Go to bed... 

00:47:35
MARSHA LINEHAN I can’t imagine giving up that time. So my guess is that, that time is your downtime. 

00:47:40
GREG Yeah. 

00:47:40
MARSHA LINEHAN And so, it sounds like it might be extraordinary -- extraordinarily difficult to give it up. And if you, you would only lose a half an hour if you did the other two hours and then you could do one hour on the weekends. 

00:47:55
GREG Okay. 

00:47:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Do you think you could get yourself to actually write for two hours? 

00:48:00
GREG Yeah, you know, at least if I were sitting there and had and just were at least, even if I were what -- or at least if I was sitting there for and just doing something... 

00:48:15
MARSHA LINEHAN So the key thing is you have to sit in front of the... 

00:48:15
GREG Right. 

00:48:15
MARSHA LINEHAN You work on a computer, right? 

00:48:20
GREG That’s right. 

00:48:20
MARSHA LINEHAN So you just have to sit -- you have to turn the computer on, you have to sit in front of the computer and you have to put your fingers on the keypad. 

00:48:25
GREG Right. 

00:48:25
MARSHA LINEHAN That’s it. 

00:48:25
GREG And not look at e-mail -- right... 

00:48:25
MARSHA LINEHAN No, you can’t look at e-mail, you can’t do another thing. And then you could just sit there with your hands there. And you don’t have to work, you just have to have your hands on the keyboard without typing -- with a first page that you’re writing up there. 

00:48:35
GREG Right. 

00:48:35
MARSHA LINEHAN And then you can look at it. 

00:48:40
GREG Right. 

00:48:40
MARSHA LINEHAN And stare at it for a long time. Do you think that would actually work though? 

00:48:40
GREG About sitting there and staring at it? 

00:48:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:48:45
GREG Yes, I do because that’s what I do... 

00:48:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, what are you currently doing for those two hours? 

00:48:50
GREG Yeah, I am avoiding doing other things. I like – during those two hours, I’ve even gone to the grocery store, but honestly I'll check e-mail or look on the Internet or look at the mail. 

00:49:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, because that’s not your writing time right? 

00:49:05
GREG No, those two hours, it is my writing time. 

00:49:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Oh, I see, oh, you avoid that too? 

00:49:10
GREG I actively, yeah. 

00:49:10
MARSHA LINEHAN I see. 

00:49:15
GREG I mean, I do get stuff done. I may again, seem like I get nothing done. I actually do sit down and write, but -- but it’s just been... 

00:49:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, why do more? I mean, it sounds like maybe if that’s all the writing you need to do. What’s wrong with that? 

00:49:25
GREG Oh, I guess I couldn't look at it that way I suppose. 

00:49:30
MARSHA LINEHAN I mean, here is the deal, you had to be clear what you really want, not what, you know, my issue isn’t that if you don’t do it, that means you don't want it. It’s really to me, listening to your life, if you’re working all the way until nine at night, come home and go to bed, it’s hard for me to imagine how it will be reasonable to take the only free time you have and write every day. 

00:49:55
GREG Hmmm-hmm. 

00:49:55
MARSHA LINEHAN And so, I can imagine writing those two hours, but I can’t imagine, if you're -- so it’s just a question of being clear that you want to do this, 'cos if you do, then you’ve got to do your dissertation approach and put in a contingency. And we’re clear now and we know that you’re a person if you put them in can make yourself keep them. 

00:50:15
GREG Yeah. 

00:50:15
MARSHA LINEHAN So, that means that if you wanna do it, you’ve got to put a contingency in. 

00:50:20
GREG Okay. 

00:50:20
MARSHA LINEHAN So, my advise to you on the contingency would be the following. 

00:50:25
GREG Okay. 

00:50:25
MARSHA LINEHAN You’ve got two hours as four half hours, every half hour you’re not sitting there with your fingers on it and a page of writing in front of you is a half hour a day that you do no exercise. 

00:50:40
GREG Okay. Yeah, that’s tough. 

00:50:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Would that do it? 

00:50:50
GREG That would. 

00:50:50
MARSHA LINEHAN And would -- are you a person who could keep the contingency? 

00:50:50
GREG Yes. I can keep contingencies. 

00:50:55
MARSHA LINEHAN I know, see it's fabulous I can already tell that just listening to you. Okay, you seem the type that can. Okay, so, now, you live here right... 

00:51:05
GREG That’s right. 

00:51:05
MARSHA LINEHAN ...in town. And you’ve got friends in the audience, right? 

00:51:05
GREG That’s right. 

00:51:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, where are those friends? 

00:51:10
GREG Hello. 

00:51:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Raise your hands. 

00:51:10
GREG Hello, friends. 

00:51:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Where are those friends? 

00:51:10
GREG Apparently I have no friends in the audience. Oh, there they are – 

00:51:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, there they are, okay. So, we need to make... 

00:51:15
GREG Some in the back. 

00:51:15
MARSHA LINEHAN ...okay, so you need to ask your friends to keep you on track here. 

00:51:20
GREG Yeah, Lynn(ph) and Wadna keep me on track. Lynn I see every week. So... 

00:51:25
MARSHA LINEHAN So, do you go to team with them do you have a treatment team? 

00:51:30
GREG No, but I work in the -- or I do stuff on Mondays with them. 

00:51:30
MARSHA LINEHAN You do stuff on Mondays. 

00:51:35
GREG Yeah. 

00:51:35
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So -- 

00:51:35
GREG So, I'll see on Mondays, so that will be good. 

00:51:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so I want to know, are you gonna do this now? 

00:51:40
GREG Yes, I will. 

00:51:40
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, for absolutely sure, I mean, we’re really agreeing to it. 

00:51:45
GREG No, honestly. Yes -- 

00:51:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, what are we -- 

00:51:45
GREG ...absolutely sure. 

00:51:45
MARSHA LINEHAN So what are we agreeing to exactly? 

00:51:45
GREG We’re agreeing to that, I am gonna sit there for two hours, and for every half hour, I do not write -- I am sorry, every half an hour, I don’t sit there with my fingers on the keyboard, that really -- 

00:52:00
MARSHA LINEHAN With the -- and it has to be the page. 

00:52:00
GREG With the page up there that I am writing on. 

00:52:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Is that you write, yeah. 

00:52:00
GREG Every half hour that I do not do it, is a half hour I cannot exercise... 

00:52:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. So what if you do it for 29.. 

00:52:10
GREG ...never thought it was a contingency. 

00:52:10
MARSHA LINEHAN What if you do it for 29 minutes, but not 30. No exercises to like you know, there has to be the whole 30 minutes. 

00:52:20
GREG That'll be scalp effect, I’ll just have to do the extra minute by that point just to -- in order to get my-- 

00:52:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Hmmm-hmm, you can be late on your phone call. But you can’t put it off and say, you’re gonna write another time. 

00:52:35
GREG No. 

00:52:35
MARSHA LINEHAN I mean, let’s agree, is those two hours are nothing, you cannot say, "Oh! I didn’t get a half an hour, but I want to exercise, I’ll do it this weekend." 

00:52:45
GREG No, I think that’s what’s actually gotten me in. And the fact I just did it in front of a huge audience has really got, you know, now I have to keep it. So -- 

00:52:50
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so let’s be clear now, what are we agreeing to again. 

00:52:55
GREG Okay, so we’re agreeing to two hours, the two hours identified on Monday, which is good. For every half hour, I don’t do it, is a half hour I cannot exercise, if it's even 29 minutes, I cannot exercise for half an hour. For each... 

00:53:10
MARSHA LINEHAN And you cannot put it off till when? 

00:53:15
GREG And I cannot put it off to another time, I have to do it during that time period. 

00:53:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Yes, exactly. Okay, so you may have to lose a couple of exercises, but I guess you'll have to lose more. 

00:53:25
GREG Yeah. 

00:53:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. The key is to remember what I said to her, which is, I'll say to you, is let the consequence do the work. 

00:53:30
GREG Yes. 

00:53:30
MARSHA LINEHAN So, the only thing your friends have to make sure of is, not that you do anything, no one is worried about what you do. What we’re worried about is, if you don’t do it, that you could actually lose four whole days of exercise. 

00:53:45
GREG Yes. 

00:53:45
MARSHA LINEHAN Alright, so as long as you’re willing to miss the exercise, you don’t have to write. 

00:53:50
GREG Yes. 

00:53:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. 

00:53:55
GREG I am willing. 

00:53:55
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. I think that you... 

00:53:55
GREG It scares me a little bit, yeah, it’s good. 

00:54:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, yeah. 

00:54:00
GREG It’s a good consequence 'cos there's a lot tied up in that. 

00:54:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, I am sure, I can tell. Okay, this is good, okay. So -- but we -- just remember the issue is not whether you write or not, the issue is whether you put the consequence in, that’s the key. The key -- the whole key is the consequence. 

00:54:15
GREG Absolutely. 

00:54:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, fabulous. Stop for a moment and tell me, okay, so, now we’re out of this, backwards. 

00:54:20
GREG Okay. 

00:54:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, put your analytic mind on, your psychotherapist mind on. Okay, so how is this for you? What was your experience of this back and forth? 

00:54:30
GREG It was very good because it got me out of myself in a way that I hadn’t expected. And honestly a consequence like exercise, I would have never picked because that seems almost aversive. But it seems like a typical -- or it almost seems like something people usually have to work to do. And I work to get that going, but it’s an interesting consequence that I have to say, I would have not picked for myself, that’s a good one, 'cos I wouldn’t give that up. 

00:55:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah, I want to be sure though, this is not such a big consequence that you'll actually not give it up even if you don’t write because if you do that then of course the whole plan won’t work. 

00:55:15
GREG No, no, I’ll do it. 

00:55:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, because if that happens in... 

00:55:15
GREG You can miss exercise, you can miss and it will be okay. 

00:55:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Thank you, yes. 

00:55:20
GREG Yeah. 

00:55:20
MARSHA LINEHAN Not too okay, though. 

00:55:25
GREG Just not to, you know -- please... 

00:55:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, so anyway, what else, how did you -- did you feel I was judgmental? Did you feel I was helpful? Did you learn anything from it? What about my manner or any of that? Was it... 

00:55:35
GREG No, I got scared. I thought that you were gonna try to convince me not to do the writing at some point. And so I didn’t want to give up on that. So I got scared a little bit there. I didn’t feel judged by you. 

00:55:50
MARSHA LINEHAN And see that was me doing the devil’s advocate 'cos what I was trying to do, was move it so that if you were going to do it, you would have to talk to yourself into it instead of me. 

00:55:55
GREG Yeah, that was good. 

00:56:00
MARSHA LINEHAN Yeah. 

00:56:00
GREG 'cos I was like, no, no, no, I don’t want to go that direction. 

00:56:05
MARSHA LINEHAN Okay, alright. Any other comments you want to make to the audience or to me? 

00:56:10
GREG No, thank you. 

00:56:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Thank you. 

00:56:10
GREG Okay. 

00:56:10
MARSHA LINEHAN Alright. 

00:56:15
GREG Thanks. 

00:56:15
MARSHA LINEHAN Thank you. 

00:56:20
[sil.] 

00:56:25
MARSHA LINEHAN Well, and both of these that was a little more -- there was -- you see that in a chain analysis, I also weave in a little treatment. But both of them were very similar and so the treatments were also very similar. But -- and when you're the therapist, you’re in a position to monitor the consequences much better. So thank you, I think this -- they kept telling me, she kept bringing me numbers to say, how much time I had. And the last time was one minute. So I have a feeling that I’ve used up my time. Thank you, thank you.
