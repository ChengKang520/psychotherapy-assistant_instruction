USING HYPNOSIS IN BRIEF THERAPY 

00:00:20
STEPHEN LANKTON, MSW, DAHB 

00:00:35
STEPHEN LANKTON I'm going to telephones me and says I want hypnosis. I got some X diagnosis and I and I want to know and I understand that you do hypnosis so I want to send and finally with you for hypnosis. I don't accept that I this is like going to your doctor and saying you know I have like really cold extremities I want you to treat me for hypo thyroid maybe you don't have hypothyroid maybe that's not the best treatment for those symptoms so we have to set the pendulum swinging correctly right from the start you can't just call me and say I want brain surgery or whatever it is I'll do psychotherapy and if hypnosis is a useful tool will do it and at some point it's possible that someone will come in and and really we have planned on hypnosis is the intervention I can't think of an example but I'm sure it's happened but for the most part what happens is we start doing therapy brief therapy talks talking and there will be moments when it really is salient to move into hypnosis and those that the natural ones are when if Larry's speaking and he's. Any pauses and he starts thinking back about something that he wants to put into words or explained better for me if we're at the point in the relationship where that seems like he knows I know something relevant for him than that's a good moment that is the moment of conversational introspection that comes up that's a great time to introduce hypnosis you know with the table I want you to close your eyes and get comfortable the other thing that comes to mind here is that I didn't think of saying this sort of put it in a better spot in my presentation but you may have state laws you need to adhere to in Florida for example to do hypnosis you have to pass a certain number of hours in some things like progressive relaxation and so on I don't know I don't know what goes on state to state in Arizona where I live there are no such regulations but umm check your state rules on that so you don't get in trouble and it's all in no matter what state you're in it's not a bad thing you have to do a treatment plan probably in every state and have assigned by the patient. So one of the interventions that is listed that I may use on the sheet of for the treatment plan is hypnosis and I have the initial add if that's relevant and so make sure you cover yourself as a professional for starters protects you. Presumably it protects the patient and I hope it does and also it's going to protect the profession from nuts that are doing things that are going to make us all look bad brainwashing somebody in taking their money makes it to the front of the New York Times it's never good I wasn't going to say that so it's a good thing to keep in mind. Okay so we've covered some of the traditional myths that don't apply we've covered some of the moments that if it's useful to introduce hypnosis. Another moment that it's useful to introduce hypnosis is when you're really at and impasse now this sounds like kind of a cop out this is sort of the I don't know what to do next so we're going to do hypnosis that's not what I'm saying exactly what I'm saying is that you didn't know what to do next and it's not helping is not proceeding successfully to anything you may know somewhat intimately the work of fritz Pearls and pearls would be in a gestalt with somebody and then all of a sudden it would bog down in that be moving anywhere and all of a sudden he would say you're at an impasse. Why not we're at an impasse and that's the exact moment that it would be useful to say let's do something in another modality because this modality has stopped being successful for the productive exchange of ideas. So that's what I'm talking about when those impasses occur it's not a bad plan to say look let's do the following thing and there's a couple of things we can do so I'm not sure how this is going to proceed because I don't know what Larry is going to give me umm it could very well be that we'll have a chance to demonstrate several comeback to waking state demonstrated another moment or maybe it's just going to go on continually I don't know so now we find them so high Larry thanks for coming. 

00:05:10
LARRY hi. 

00:05:10
STEPHEN LANKTON we might. 

00:05:10
LARRY good to be here yeah I was still come up because I have been demo for awhile and then as I was sitting here I I like learning and I'm looking forward to valuing from this experience. 

00:05:25
STEPHEN LANKTON and did you. 

00:05:30
LARRY oh and I didn't have a solid thing before it I've thought of things I want to work on. 

00:05:35
STEPHEN LANKTON okay. 

00:05:35
LARRY I had two things but I think what one's an injury thing but of a nerve issue and this side of my body but I had some stuff come up around focus and around in early session this morning. Around my clarity of five when I was younger. 

00:06:00
STEPHEN LANKTON you were you weren't a demo for now. 

00:06:00
LARRY No but he did a group a group demonstration. 

00:06:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Its This disturbed maybe too strong a word but that disturb you with is somehow what this clarity of thought issue. 

00:06:10
LARRY Didn't disturb me. 

00:06:15
STEPHEN LANKTON a silent mind is some kind of a. 

00:06:15
LARRY what this van well I got in touch uh… with as a child things that I would think that that other people weren't thinking and how it's been. Uh… Our followed up those ideas into I am now and how sometimes others clarity of things that I believe quite young that I've developed quite thoroughly and other times I'm quite brilliant about what I've developed quite thoroughly. 

00:06:45
STEPHEN LANKTON I'm being either one of those things right I I don't understand. Could you tell me how it's the kind of thing you'd work on what what about it would you know. 

00:06:55
LARRY how would I work on. 

00:07:00
STEPHEN LANKTON yeah I mean. Yeah I mean what do you see as the. 

00:07:00
LARRY I guess it's a general kind of a. 

00:07:05
STEPHEN LANKTON I'm not sure yet it sounds like there was some I use the word disturbing that didn't fit for you so I'm not sure. 

00:07:10
LARRY oh I was definitely this served as a child that that my family we're we're seeing very seem to lose a lot of that was important to them that seemed not important to me yeah and so they're usually about something that someone was upset about and I think when I was younger I didn't even realize this elbow I realised quite clearly. 

00:07:35
STEPHEN LANKTON I will you an only child her. 

00:07:35
LARRY No I was the younger child of two child's in my immediate family to children and my immediate family and I'm thinking of my my my uh bigger family with my cousins and my mother's sister and my uncle. 

00:07:50
STEPHEN LANKTON and how far separated you from your next three area or pseudo sibling three Yeah you're the youngest and holding you know. 

00:08:00
LARRY I'm 61 years old as of two two ago. 

00:08:00
STEPHEN LANKTON wow. 

00:08:05
LARRY well HI everyone knows. 

00:08:10
STEPHEN LANKTON wow I still think. Looking pretty young for. 

00:08:15
LARRY yeah I I tend to have some youthful exuberance. As I think I've noticed that you have at times. 

00:08:25
STEPHEN LANKTON and what's this deal about that right hand side of your body. 

00:08:30
LARRY Sometime in June and I woke up with a stiff neck and umm and… and I was in the middle of like helping with a dance therapy workshop and it's kinda work through a little but basically my arm then became tingling and numb for since then to various degrees and I had some stiffness related to that and pain that's subsided somewhat. And however now there's still like it's a little tingly right now and…and comes and goes. and I've been even tracking that I now having times for hours and hours where I'm either not aware of it and or it's not… there's not a sensation that's uncomfortable like that. 

00:09:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Are you right-handed. 

00:09:20
LARRY What? Yes, I'm right handed. 

00:09:25
STEPHEN LANKTON So this becomes a problem for writing or typing or something? 

00:09:30
LARRY so it has been less of a problem for writing, it's a problem for for now that I've finally succumb to an iPhone, it's a problem for texting. It's a problem to playing drums says I'm a musician and it's a problem to holding things in one hand if I need to do that for something it's a problem to movement in some of the movement work that I started doing more of because I'm I partnered with a movement therapist. 

00:09:55
STEPHEN LANKTON I don't know that any either of these things would bring a person to therapy so you know and he said well I don't I didn't advertise it as therapy advertisers. Using hypnosis and brief therapy. So umm… let's just do a quick experiment than you've been addressed before I suppose you close your eyes when you go into trance. 

00:10:20
LARRY sometimes. 

00:10:20
STEPHEN LANKTON won't try closing your eyes and then you'd have to pay attention to me. Other than my voice. 

00:10:30
[sil.] 

00:10:35
STEPHEN LANKTON and of course you have nice relaxed exhale and so take a moment to follow this exhale into a sense of relaxation that goes down both arms down your chest exhale go into your fingers and I don't know if you'd like to let the relaxation spread down pasture built into your legs are up past your lanyard into your neck and face first let it relax your neck and head face as your cheeks relax your eyes relax. 

00:11:15
[sil.] 

00:11:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Certainly your ideas will relax. You'll have an opportunity to become aware of experiences that may be in the back of your mind that you can bring to the front of your mind sooner or later and maybe in such a fashion that it will be helpful for you today and for me in the demonstration today as well and then the relaxation go down into your thighs. Because everybody knows that sooner or later and down into your cans. While you adjust various things in your body you also adjust framework in your mind that there are a number of interesting and comfortable and creative ideas that we can have or that we know are right there waiting to be developed. 

00:12:15
[sil.] 

00:12:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Everybody has their own way of coming up with ideas and sooner or later everyone will come up with an idea conscious mind might be surprised to find out just what your unconscious delivers up to you and of course it can be creative but it can also be a dome normal boring curious So many different ideas and then after you've had a couple of moments and I'll be silent. Maybe you'll have something different to say and if not that's fine I wouldn't want to have you go deeper into transplant counting backwards from ten to one because everybody knows that there's a sense of depth that comes when you're proprioception is altered by walking down a stairway there were ten stairs at nine different feeling than eight as you went deeper. Seven six Eventually people walking downstairs at the ripe old age of sixty forget why they were going down the stairs you get down to four there's even a Joe to one man goes into the doctor and he says I am having the following problems the doctor says I think you ought to start thinking about the hereafter and you to me and says oh gosh doc I I think about that all the time every every day I walk into a room and wondered what am I here after. 

00:14:15
LARRY I heard that. 

00:14:20
STEPHEN LANKTON so run back up the stairs for a second and open you're exuberant. Child and tell me if you were thinking about anything that might be useful well. 

00:14:30
LARRY Well Along the earlier theme I had a wonderful experience of coming into like a light and an open space and like. Various family conflicts like. Like tangled webs of energy where does a broken away and I was free to just walk in my own life and umm that was a nice feeling and and then I walked and then when I was down the stairs I was excited about about learning things down there I can I can start to see things I hadn't yet seen. 

00:15:10
STEPHEN LANKTON No so you want to go back. 

00:15:15
LARRY yeah I liked it down there. 

00:15:15
STEPHEN LANKTON what about this magical web stuff went away and that seems a little. 

00:15:20
LARRY Yeah. 

00:15:25
STEPHEN LANKTON a little rapid of success in breaking. 

00:15:30
LARRY so well that wasn't rapid. For me as a real person. Through my 61 year. 

00:15:35
STEPHEN LANKTON so it was a conceptualization of what you've done. 

00:15:40
LARRY it was sort of a revisiting of reality but part of the problem that I presented with is is how come after going through difficulties and coming to the other side sometimes I'm still caught back in the web or I'm paying attention to something about it that I don't necessarily need to go on for my own betterment or even for others. 

00:16:00
STEPHEN LANKTON do you think that might be what everybody does. 

00:16:05
LARRY I think it is I know you know I mean I revisited it and my own attitudes about for instance to the election and things how we become entangled and thrown backwards when we're not when I'm not. There's no need to give up that power. 

00:16:20
STEPHEN LANKTON well think about this next part for a second while I comment. So my comment is that I'm not sure that we weren't at an impasse. To begin with and so it was a good time to say Well let's and change the modality and change your frame of reference of thinking and so so the so the introduction of hypnosis at that point was basically because we were headed down a dead-end street I think. 

00:16:50
LARRY I thing I like that. 

00:16:55
STEPHEN LANKTON but you didn't hear that and so now and then we also know a couple of other things now Larry knows that interacting with me in that way in front of you guys is not a problem but we've broken the ice and that'll give us an excellent thing to have accomplished and he's got a hell of a quick mind his ability to conceptualize and to articulate what he's conceptualized as above the norm. I'd say and so we can expect quite a bit from him with very little input from me which is a wonderful thing to have in it and I still don't know what direction to go to be therapeutically useful and there may not be a place to go to be therapeutically useful if it's not what's happening for him at this time and maybe it is but I mean maybe it will become that way in the next couple of minutes but so that's my comment on the first interaction here but if you weren't here I wouldn't have said that that would have just been. Then I would just be saying Well so now you know what eats reflect that and what do you have any other thoughts about what you might want to do today with this useful for you Well I am not sure I gave you time to think about it once you you know. Take a moment. 

00:18:10
[sil.] 

00:18:15
LARRY well I know right off the reminder of that of that of that permission for me to be in my own life and to have things out of the way. So that I can continue to learn and find new new new things to be interested in is a powerful thing I like to feel more stronger stronger connection to you. 

00:18:45
STEPHEN LANKTON you have a sense that there's a great deal more to youth you haven't been able to illuminate or beam out for yourself yeah. 

00:18:55
LARRY Yes yes. 

00:19:00
STEPHEN LANKTON do you have a Missouri they want a picture of what that looks is going to look like or or is it just a big unknown for you. 

00:19:15
LARRY it's it's sort of the simple and also complicated. Just to make it harder for you. 

00:19:25
STEPHEN LANKTON it just makes it harder for life and you have it as I read somewhere else thought it was a good job annuity relapse edited to the greatest burden is is an unused potential. 

00:19:40
LARRY Exactly. 

00:19:40
STEPHEN LANKTON And that seems to be where you have. 

00:19:45
LARRY yeah I yeah. 

00:19:50
STEPHEN LANKTON And I don't mean to be. Saying or anything but how come you think you have unused potential. 

00:19:55
LARRY Well I don't know that I have unused I've used a lot of my potential quite a bit. 

00:20:00
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah. 

00:20:00
LARRY And I'm very very helpful to help others use their potentials. 

00:20:05
LARRY that you think there would have been more could have been more maybe more. 

00:20:10
LARRY Yes probably. I'd say yeah I don't know exactly. 

00:20:15
STEPHEN LANKTON Good answer. 

00:20:15
LARRY yeah I don't know exactly yeah sometimes. 

00:20:20
STEPHEN LANKTON I Bonnie summarized in in let's use this moment to find some of that potential and even edit distance we can look at it and not do go back down the stairs and get a little deeper at every step I really need to count you may consider one step her breath or two steps I don't know what you find at the bottom some people like to do hypnosis with sort of a guided imagery I don't really like to do that but in their guided imageries they have people walk into a room at the bottom of the stairway in their own personal private room that nobody knows about and they close the door and within that room there may be a number. Of discoverable cues that help them in some way then I'm just going to say a few of them and I'm not going to elaborate right yet but some of the things is that there's a wise person there waiting that knows answers to things and people made whole psychotherapies about consulting your inner healer. Your inner showman. 

00:21:45
[sil.] 

00:21:50
STEPHEN LANKTON other imageries their axes but not as dangerous as Pandora's box and they open up each box or boxes they select in they discover something in that box that maybe symbolic. Probably is symbolic even if it has a literal meaning if he has some symbolic overtones that are not apparent at the time and those therapies when people talk about those things they sometimes speak about amulets that are found are crystals that are found old books that are found in Reading in the old book they may discover themselves as the main character. 

00:22:40
[sil.] 

00:22:50
STEPHEN LANKTON there's some sort of a jury it causes deep relaxation. So much relaxation in fact in your case that there's a yawn it's on suppressible and when those muscle tensions release as we mentioned in this morning's dialogue there's simultaneous relaxation at least temporarily of a rigid mental set. there are other ways of relaxing or rigid mental set without yawning so you don't want to allow Larry to make any connection that he needs to yawn perpetually forever. 

00:23:35
[sil.] 

00:23:40
STEPHEN LANKTON but in reading those characters in the book there's always a stimulation of unconscious ideas that the conscious mind doesn't exactly grasp at the moment and the postponement of learning is something everybody knows and postpone learning for minutes weeks days years milliseconds your conscious mind may think you've uncovered a meaning which your unconscious has a great deal more to give or possibly your unconscious may think you've uncovered meaning when your conscious mind is a sense that there's a lot more to give you you've been looking at this like a client I knew one time who thought that he had a great deal more to give. it was surprising to him to discover. After giving and giving and giving how exhausted he was never really had a lot more to take good he's learned long ago. Not to take much. Some people can't take because they don't trust the people who give them some people don't take because they've not seen it happening around them and they never learned it other people don't take because they think they'll lose friends if they ask people won't like them there's a myriad of reasons are all written in the book as the main character goes through this story. 

00:25:25
[sil.] 

00:25:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Sometimes the book has a mirror on the last several pages after the person's gone through this long journey of overcoming obstacles and the people that are obstacles in our path to finding our self they come to the last page and see a mirror in disbelief turn to the next page and there's an only to be found another mirror of looking at the self. 

00:26:00
[sil.] 

00:26:05
STEPHEN LANKTON and so on a third mirror. 

00:26:10
[sil.] 

00:26:15
STEPHEN LANKTON and they scratch with curiosity into the mirror to find there's nothing behind it that's all there is. 

00:26:20
[sil.] 

00:26:25
STEPHEN LANKTON in in some of the rooms and some of the guided imageries of this sort of thing people are have a darkened room and other times they turn on the light in the room in that light. Still another idea in some of these fantasies people suggests there's a door. Beyond that room they walk out that door and then it's very private and I don't know if they forget or if they never knew forgetting is something everybody knows how to do they just don't remember and you can forget things suddenly and rapidly. Know that it's there but not appeals to put words on it until you're distracted and then it's gone like when you jibber jabbering with a friend and you drop your keys on the table then when it's time to find your keys it was not something you were very conscious of it to time your conscious mind maybe do something differently jibber jabber but whatever happens they roam around beyond that door in later spoiler alert when they come out through that door back into the room they can't remember what they were doing but they know it was important they know it was good for them there's almost a longing to do it again and that's the interesting thing about being in trance you can begin to rehearse an idea in the back of your mind but failing to completely rehearse the entire idea leaves it in a state of comfortable yet eager unrest to continue Coming back into your mind and allowing you to work on it again and again. So you can rehearse something go to sleep wake up in the morning and rehearse again. Surely every songwriter and musician dancer knows about that sort of thing. 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:10
STEPHEN LANKTON and whatever's left unspoken unheard. Back here are in a dance rehearsal. 

00:29:25
[sil.] 

00:29:30
STEPHEN LANKTON is available for maturation development later on so it would be a great idea for sooner or later it's going to happen that you go back into the room and close that door and maybe still look around the room if the lights weren't on. Turn them on and if they were on turn them off her experience with a different box or different healer different Sharman or whatever it happens to be. Maybe asking the all important question what's the meaning of life just to get a good laugh out of it because everybody should ask what's the meaning of life when they meet some wise Sharman that's what you do. It's almost like a Geico commercial and then coming out of the room on the other side and climbing up the stairway three quarters of the way and recognizing that you're about to be half of the way and you have half of you sensorium and cognition and motor behavior. Cognitive skills back three-quarters of the way out. 

00:30:45
[sil.] 

00:30:50
STEPHEN LANKTON and there's some emotion on your face especially on the right side. Did you notice. 

00:31:00
LARRY the emotions I felt them right away going down the stairs. 

00:31:05
STEPHEN LANKTON you brought it with you. 

00:31:05
LARRY yeah. 

00:31:10
STEPHEN LANKTON do you want to mention what it is you love me too. Oh let me hear your rendition. 

00:31:20
LARRY Umm I went through a lot of it's a little hard to focus like I went through a lot of different learning's on I went down the stairs umm I talked to my grandmother and my mother and there was a wise energy like man before you mentioned that and there was a lot of saying here okay the way you are and the sort of real acceptance. 

00:31:50
STEPHEN LANKTON because out to sadnesses. 

00:31:50
LARRY Yeah I don't remember the different movements. 

00:31:55
STEPHEN LANKTON you need to put the satellite into this sadness and have it instead of just I mean that's not something you normally do I guess now I do this I mean in front of other people and perhaps. 

00:32:05
LARRY well yeah I mean that was a piece of it because one of the things that intrigued me about coming up here was that I was just telling my friend that I used to over volunteer for everything and take a lot and part of this I'm remembering now is this period of my life the last four or five years I needed to start taking again start asking and that was a very significant feeling. 

00:32:35
STEPHEN LANKTON well I hate to break the third wall or whatever it is here in our improved but would you be willing to ask this group of people if they would accept your sadness. 

00:32:50
LARRY Okay yeah would you accept my sadness. 

00:32:55
STEPHEN LANKTON You're laughing. It was just kind of incongruent with sadness can you get in touch with your sadness as you do it so they're sad partners excepted. 

00:33:05
[sil.] 

00:33:10
LARRY Yeah there's there's definitely a feeling of old tired or the sadness. 

00:33:15
STEPHEN LANKTON hmm and also the fourth push the river here but I would if you were part of my life. 

00:33:25
LARRY I've been a trip stay with it. 

00:33:30
STEPHEN LANKTON very well when the world in the past and. 

00:33:30
LARRY well there's been a theme really family. Yes and then there's also a theme that I was a twin and my other twin died. 

00:33:40
STEPHEN LANKTON who that's a birth joseph pre-birth Who told you. 

00:33:45
LARRY my mother and father was unsure but there is enough evidence now and believe that is true but besides whatever those details are I got in touch with this feeling of like oh these angels were around me down the stairs and they've been around different times what I've hadn't near death potentials like. 

00:34:05
STEPHEN LANKTON you say goodbye. You say goodbye. 

00:34:10
LARRY Say goodbye. 

00:34:10
STEPHEN LANKTON close your eyes and imagine your twin in the casket in front of it. 

00:34:15
LARRY oh yes. 

00:34:20
[sil.] 

00:34:25
STEPHEN LANKTON makes me sad watching. So go ahead and do some grief in here that these started. 

00:34:35
[sil.] 

00:34:40
LARRY Yeah. 

00:34:45
[sil.] 

00:34:50
STEPHEN LANKTON ask him to let you go. 

00:34:55
LARRY He's let me though. 

00:34:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Asking if it's okay for you to let him go. 

00:35:00
[sil.] 

00:35:10
STEPHEN LANKTON you can love him and let him go both. 

00:35:15
LARRY I mean he wants me to know whether the message that was here but it's good to feel it in that I'm not I'm not. That sometimes I think I'm dying I'm actually being Born. 

00:35:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Why still with him go back to him for a minute and let's think about another aspect that he's been a friend and you want him to know that you're going to get other friends and you don't want to just rely upon him for friendship and closeness and ask if that's okay. 

00:35:50
LARRY Okay. 

00:35:55
STEPHEN LANKTON even to forget about him sometimes. 

00:36:00
LARRY it's hard to do. 

00:36:05
STEPHEN LANKTON do just keep with it and see if you can wrangler. Way for him to give that permission. 

00:36:10
[sil.] 

00:36:30
STEPHEN LANKTON keep them trying to get that out. Ask if he'll accept your sadness. 

00:36:45
[sil.] 

00:37:05
LARRY It seem to feel a little guilty. 

00:37:10
STEPHEN LANKTON You're telling me you'd like to get the right hand side of your body back under your control and… 

00:37:15
LARRY Yes. 

00:37:15
STEPHEN LANKTON He can't have it. 

00:37:20
[sil.] 

00:38:00
STEPHEN LANKTON And it seems with it for a second to the emptiness goes away. 

00:38:05
[sil.] 

00:38:15
LARRY Feeling more slightly perplexed and how he's been so involved in this, stealing away on my right side. Well, but I also kind of get us are 

00:38:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Sometimes good ideas in the back of our mind in the slowly and gradually come to the front of our mind. Such a way that we're not distressed and we're not disturbed and we become aware that you can handle things and learn things and do things. 

00:38:45
LARRY Yeah. 

00:38:45
STEPHEN LANKTON And let his potential stay with him so the easiest bring your potential with you. 

00:38:55
[sil.] 

00:39:10
LARRY Yeah, I can remember that it wasn't too long ago and I realized how much I missed him. Come here. 

00:39:15
[sil.] 

00:39:30
STEPHEN LANKTON And maybe it's time once again to ask if it's okay to have your sadness and making sure that you still feel connected. 

00:39:35
LARRY Yeah, it feels as though this Larry is enough for the both of them but I also feel like I would have been twice… twice the person I am if… if he was still here. 

00:39:50
STEPHEN LANKTON It's pretty heavy. 

00:39:55
LARRY Yeah, it's a heavy thing. First the fact that, yeah, there was uncertainty about the reality of this, of my twin dying because there wasn't the technology. 

00:40:10
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah, I am inclined to have you tell that Younger Larry inside that you wouldn't be twice the person who were always more with the presence of another, that's true. 

00:40:20
LARRY Yeah. Yeah, I know literally…literally… 

00:40:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Mathematical line, act mathematical accidents adhesive, another Larry but uh… 

00:40:25
LARRY Yes, true. 

00:40:25
STEPHEN LANKTON But tell that part it's still umm driven. 

00:40:35
LARRY Yeah, that's an exaggeration. 

00:40:40
STEPHEN LANKTON Oh, good. Yeah, certainly you'd be more. 

00:40:40
LARRY Yeah, I just denied for too long that…that it would have been a benefit from the actual life of my twin to be alive throughout the days that I'm often. 

00:40:50
STEPHEN LANKTON I know that would be awesome. 

00:40:55
LARRY So that's… that's really all that is. So thanks for grounding, you know. 

00:41:00
STEPHEN LANKTON And one of the things that way to enhance that so that the loss of that particular love is… is replaced by something else. 

00:41:10
LARRY It…it does feel like what the first statement I made that that I'm already enough for both of us, in reality is that I feel that that part of me has always been here and… and helped me be as who I am and as a person. 

00:41:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, maybe dragging you down the myth is from the Curie Jieqi, which I guess is the oldest book in Japan that the… the Japan islands were created as… as there were two gods and one of them died, went to the underworld and got stuck there and couldn't be pulled back. And so a great deal of the purification ritual that you hear about worldwide comes from the Japanese ideas that the purification is to wash off the… the connection to the spirits who have gone to the underworld and now I don't mean in a hell I mean. Yes and… and free you from those kinds of pools and tugs which… which the first didn't… I came here with their names, their brother and sister and one… one them died and got tugged back… went to the Underworld got tucked back, so the purification is to prevent that from happening to anyone else and prevent that from happening to the survivor. What did you do to purifying yourself so that you can get death off of you? 

00:42:40
[sil.] 

00:42:45
LARRY What I'm intrigued by is that I do that a lot. Yeah, there's… there's still some there I guess. So I don't know whether that's valuable or not. 

00:42:55
STEPHEN LANKTON It has been. We only know the past. So you can make the future into a different one and next time you do that find out whether or not you have indeed succeeded fully well I'm definitely making it an obsession of course. 

00:43:10
LARRY Yeah, that's true. 

00:43:15
STEPHEN LANKTON How are we doing time wise? 

00:43:15
LARRY I don't know. 

00:43:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, we could know if my watch would wake up. Ten minutes say. Do you want to stop for second and process yourself and… and see if there's any questions even maybe. But don't ask him any questions for me and let him process. Any questions of me? 

00:43:40
[sil.] 

00:43:45
STEPHEN LANKTON Yes, sir. 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:44:00
STEPHEN LANKTON Sadly that's a great question. I say sadly because it requires an answer I don't know. The question was, it's apparent that I sometimes use humor. Is there sort of a conceptual framework here for, when to use it and when to not use it and when it would mess things up and break the flowing wind it would. When or why do I think it would help at some point time. Umm I do have intuitive answers for that but I'm not sure I have them into word, have them in words. What do you think from what you saw Can you help me answer that? 

00:44:40
[sil.] 

00:44:45
UNKNOWN I don't know. That you… Like the opponent down on the stairs. I know that (inaudible). 

00:45:25
STEPHEN LANKTON Well, I see humor as a shift of cognitive frameworks. So you're going along with the setup of the joke and all of a sudden you realize it ends entirely differently and so you end up with a different framework like I mentioned yesterday that guy sunglass please ask me well what would you call a midget psychic who was running from the police and the answer is that it's small medium and large and so if you're thinking one way with the images of the setup of the joke and then all of a sudden you shifting your cognition to something else so one answer for you for sure is if I think we got to get the current cognition dismissed. So if another use of the humorous when it really helps the two of you become more human together instead of some big scary you know therapist-client serious. World changing things and all of a sudden it's I had a client one time who came in Pensacola whereas working who's totally depressed he'd gotten out of college he was very depressed and he came to see me and I've accidentally hit it off really well with them I sit. But you're you're you went through college and how long you've been depressed and he said since before college and that's it that's funny because usually College is a device that people use and they end up not being depressed on the other side of college so something really bad must happen before you went into college right. And he said oh well yeah my my father died and and I said well what were the circumstances he said well we were in a quarrel and and I actually haven't told the story in a minute let me think how it unfolded here I said Did somebody die before college he said yeah my father died before college and I said did you think you killed him and he said, well, I… I mean, right that's pretty far out answer, you know, guess. And he said, "Yeah, we had this quarrel and I wished he was dead." And I said, "Out loud? And he said, "No, I just said it in my head." And I said and he said we had this really contentious relationship life I really hated my father and gotten a quarrel and I will send you wish you're dead. And I said out loud? And he said, no… no, I just said it in my head. And I said, oh, that's too bad, that would have been a great story. 

00:48:05
[sil.] 

00:48:10
STEPHEN LANKTON And we both burst into laughter and he wasn't depressed after that. 

00:48:15
[sil.] 

00:48:20
STEPHEN LANKTON True story. It made me think about how young talks about, you know, the therapy sort of like confession or something and… and so here at the most crucial horrible thing in his life, I found an angle to it which was pretty humorous. I mean, I can tell you intuitively but the moment it felt right it didn't feel like he was going to sue me for not being serious therapist, you know. But to actually explain what that was all, what was going on there in words it's much easier to explain it after the fact than as it happened, you know. Any other questions. Yeah. 

00:48:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, you talked about, will not be able to (inaudible). 

00:48:55
STEPHEN LANKTON Yes. 

00:49:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:49:20
STEPHEN LANKTON Yeah, there were several who's finding useful stuff all over the place. 

00:49:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:49:30
STEPHEN LANKTON umm… Well, umm… You reminding me of something that you didn't ask, that you…that tyou meant to ask. When… when Larry… When we came out of trance and I don't know if you could see the sadness on the right hand side of his face from where you sat. You couldn't see the left hand wasn't that way because it's turned to me. Could you see the sadness on his face from where you sat? Yeah, see some folks couldn't. So it's not there now by the way. But this… this eye little bit lower. There was a different muscle tension in the cheek. But who saw it in the… Anybody in front row here? You could see from where, because you're in a good angle. Can… Can you describe what you saw on his face that was, you know, it's sad or is it too subtle? 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:50:30
STEPHEN LANKTON And…and…and she reminds me that uh…the difference between the sides of the face which I could see better than you all could was a very, was a good give away too. So I knew he came out with sadness and then he had been discovering things that he wanted to talked about the twin that may have been there as part of the birth myth and so that extra piece of information which wouldn't have come out where we not to have taken the moment for him to use hypnosis and… and… and explore things with more concentration without me there and just throwing out ideas that were helpful as it turns out, you know, so that developed his, that elicited that piece of information from him and now we know that he's thinking about the twin, he's got sadness, it's on his right hand side, he's been talking about numbness on his right hand side, he's been talking about potential that wasn't used, holy crap. I mean, that's a coloring book that paints one picture basically when you connect the dots and so that's how we got to the grieving and letting go. Umm…Any questions you'd like to ask, Larry, it's okay. 

00:51:40
LARRY Yes. 

00:51:40
STEPHEN LANKTON Any questions now for Larry? 

00:51:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:51:50
LARRY Is what? 

00:51:55
STEPHEN LANKTON The question in the, for you in the back is, to what degree does Larry feel that his sadness is relieved. 

00:52:00
LARRY Umm… I don't know if I have an answer for that. I mean, I'm not, I'm umm… I'm not I'm not looking for relief from it right now. 

00:52:10
STEPHEN LANKTON Better answer. 

00:52:15
LARRY I'm really… It was really amazing to discover it was on the side, which I felt sadness but I had no… no awareness until you pointed it out so that added an important dimension for one thing. 

00:52:30
STEPHEN LANKTON Great. Nice answer. Well, if there are no more questions umm… we're… On a call we have one, go ahead. 

00:52:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:52:50
LARRY I'm… Yes. 

00:52:50
STEPHEN LANKTON The question is, is there any relief for the tingling numbness on the right side? Great question. 

00:52:55
LARRY What I'm feeling is… is a better connection in… throughout my scapula and my back to… to this other side and a sense of the tearing away. 

00:53:05
STEPHEN LANKTON Now you described that it is coming and going. So we really need more time to… 

00:53:10
LARRY Yeah, I mean I don't… It's not missing. I still have the tenderness but there's a lightness and has lots of different feelings, like I feel both more solid and more light. 

00:53:20
STEPHEN LANKTON But it's a great question as exactly what you should ask within that's kind of a session to see if that made any impact on. Well, so we've demonstrated I think successfully the use of… the use of hypnosis and brief therapy for… for a couple of outcomes that are useful. So thank you very much. Thank you. 

00:53:35
LARRY Thank you.
