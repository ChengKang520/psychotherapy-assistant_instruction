JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Thank you. 

00:01:35
THERAPY Talks If you're a parent, you know that being a parent is amazingly difficult and sometimes gratifying work. 

00:01:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN When I do public lectures about parenting I often start with a survey and so I'll do that. Here it is. I ask, "How many of you are parents?" And usually almost everybody raises their hands. There are few non-parents in the group, almost always. And then I ask, "How many of you were children?" And of course if people are really listening to me and sometimes they're not, ah, they'll raise their hands and a few people will laugh and, ah, a few people will say, "Well, I'm not a child but I'm still immature." And then I make my point and the point is if you're a parent, you know how challenging and gratifying it is, and you know it's a 24/7 job, and you know it doesn't end when your child turns 18. You're a parent for life. And if you were a child you know how important it is to have a parent that makes it absolutely clear that you are loved. But in addition to that, you know probably how important it is to have a parent that is open to learning and has some knowledge and skills about parenting. Plain and simple. 

00:02:50
And you need to keep learning 

00:02:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Parents need knowledge and skills for dealing with the challenges of parenting in the 21st century. The learning really never should end. In this talk I'm going to, ah, use stories to focus on several issues. First, what parents need in counseling from therapist and psychotherapist. Second, what parents want, their goals for their children. And third, how we, as professionals, what we need to do in order to be more effective in working with parents? 

00:03:30
John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. 

00:03:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Once upon a time, a mom came to see me about her 5-year-old son and she came in and she said, "I have a very strong-willed son." And I said to her something like, "Oh yeah, that's actually seems pretty common nowadays that, ah, a lot of parents seem to have some strong-willed kids." And she says, "No, no, no, no, no. You don't get it. I have a very strong-willed son." I said, "O-- okay. So you have a strong-willed son." She goes, "Let me tell you about it. Just the other night, I asked him to clean his room and he stood at the bottom of the stairs, put his hands on his hips and said, 'No.'" I'm thinking, "Oh, it sounds like a typical kid." And she was wo-- "Let me finish. And then I asked him again and he said no again. And then I asked him the third time and then he put his hands back on his hips and he lifted up his finger and he pointed at me and he said, 'You want a piece of me?'" And then she told me the real problem and that was, at that point in time, she did want a piece of him. So she grabbed him and she hauled upstairs in a way that was not consistent with the kind of parent that she wanted to be which is what she wanted to talk about. 

00:04:45
When you feel tremendous anger toward someone you love immensely, it can be terribly difficult and confusing 

00:04:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN This is one of the mysteries of parenting. How can you have this bundle of joy that you love more than anything else on the planet and then in the next moment just feel a rage attack about whatever that bundle of joy might be doing. This along with other mysteries is why we need to offer parents a unique form of counseling that is specifically tailored toward their particular needs. So, what do parents want? Almost all parents seem to want about the same thing and that is to raise kids that are healthy and happy and that are relatively well-adjusted. But what can we do, what do, what do parents need in a counseling session in order to move toward accomplishing those goals? 

00:05:40
We have to understand the anger and the joy. John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. 

00:05:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And the first thing is that they need empathy. They need both general empathy and specific empathy. They need general empathy because parenting now in the American culture is something that's pretty challenging. There are a lot of forces and factors that make it difficult. And a lot of times parents feel scrutinized whether they are at the playground, at church, or maybe in the grocery store specially, they feel on the spot about whether they're living up to the parenting standard which in American culture often is this sort of vision of once you have your child you'll have this 24/7 bliss together, an altered state of bliss that you have with your children and everything will always smell good and that's just not the way it is. 

00:06:25
What do parents need? A bridge to empathy, collaboration, radical acceptance, and . . . specific parenting techniques . . . But you must listen before you educate. 

00:06:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so, parents need that general empathy for that. They also-- another interesting thing about parents is they often feel simultaneously insecure and indignant. And so, they're insecure because of that scrutiny from the in-laws and the parents and the society but they're also indignant and they think, "Who are you to have the audacity to tell me how I should parent my kid, how I should I raise my kid? Who are you?" So we have to be careful of that particular emotional dilemma that parents are facing. But parents also need specific empathy like the mom who I told you about before. She needed me to hear her story about her strong-willed son who apparently, I think, may have been watching too many Clint Eastwood movies but another issue. 

00:07:15
What do parents need? A bridge to empathy, collaboration, radical acceptance, and . . . specific parenting techniques . . . But you must listen before you educate. 

00:07:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Another thing I've learned from parents is that it don't start with education even if they ask you for it. It's the wrong way to start. You need to start with empathy and compassion. If they ask you directly even say, "Well, you know, I rather listen for a while first. I rather get to know the situation first." Don't fall into the trap of being an expert who's gonna tell the parent how to parent their kid. Second thing-- first, empathy, specific, and general. Second is collaboration. We need to collaborate with parents. We need to be an expert in collaboration and not an expert on parenting to start because the parent is the one who's the expert on his or her child. The parent is the one who's the expert on the family dynamic. The parent is the one who's the expert on the parent, right? And the parent has to bring that in and unless we facilitate that process, hardly anything of what we suggest is likely to be helpful. 

00:08:15
What do parents need? A bridge to empathy, collaboration, radical acceptance, and . . . specific parenting techniques . . . But you must listen before you educate. Get a new attitude Make a plan Get support Be consistently loving John Sommers-Flanagan 

00:08:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And we should have a lot of things to suggest because there's a ton of parenting tips out there. Seventy-five thousand parenting books published a decade, there are a lot to choose from. It's hard to know. And so when it comes to judging the kind of tips and guidance that parents, uhm, are exposed to or that we offer them, we should keep a few, uhm, principles in mind. The first one is we should keep in mind that whatever approach it should focus on parents having an attitude, an open attitude to learning and then includes learning about developmental research and evidence-based approaches. Second principle is, uhm, parents need to be taught a specific new and improved plan. I mean, if they have a good attitude or attitude toward learning, that's great. But they need a specific plan. Third thing is parents need support. They need-- in whatever tips we give to not do it in isolation but to get feedback and to have support. And the fourth principle is that whatever approach that we suggest should have a, ah, that foundation of a loving relationship and a positive relationship. So that we're not-- there's a lot of bad, a lot of bad tips and advice out there for parents. We need to make sure they're relatively safe. Some I'm gonna tell two stories that illustrate some of the concepts of working with parents. Now, this first one is a story about myself and my owns parenting. And, uhm, I'm telling a story about myself partly because it's good to do a little bit of self-disclosure when you're working with parents. Not a lot, it should be limited so only one story about myself. In addition, this is a story that illustrates how important it is to engage in planning and then tweaking of the planning in your parenting. 

00:10:10
The Whispering Story 

00:10:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN When my youngest daughter was 5 she was, again, one of those strong-willed children and I was having trouble with yelling. And I remember one time a scene on the porch specially ugly when we lived in Montana, there was snow, she didn't put her boots on-- ah! I don't know. For whatever reason she was on a different time schedule than I was. Imagine that, a 5-year-old. I was heating up and angry and I got down and her face and I said-- I yelled, "Get your boots on!" You know, vein sticking out, probably spitting bad stuff. Her eyes get big, I scared her, she got her boots on. Later that evening my wife who happened to be, ah, there and witnessed the event, you know, it's sometimes hard to take feedback from our romantic partners. Uhm, it's not my favorite thing to do but she said, "John, I know that that's not the kind of parent you wanna be." And I said, "You're totally right." Absolutely, she was so right. And so now I told her, "I'm not gonna yell anymore." Ah, you know, big promise. Instead, I have a new plan. I'm gonna whisper. I read it in a parenting book. It's a really good thing to do. When you're angry, whisper. So I had that in my mind, new plan. And, of course, if there's one thing that's inevitable in life is that there will soon be another opportunity to try to manage your anger more constructively specially with our kids. So it might have been the next day, the next week but it will soon. We're in the same situation. My daughter is on the porch, she's not putting her boots on, I get down in her face and I'm so angry but I remember I'm gonna whisper and what comes out is like something out of the exorcist movie. I say, "Get your boots on." Not my best moment. She got her boots on. She probably thought, "I wonder my father has been possessed." I don't know what she thought. She got her boots on. But this was a beginning of a big change for me. It was a big change because I became more than a one-trick pony parent. I learned I could yell but I could also do the exorcist. I could growl, I could whisper and eventually I learned the one, two, three counting magic thing. 

00:12:40
Grandma's Rule 

00:12:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And then I learned this really cool technique called Grandma's rule where you focus on the positive and you say-- it follows the formula "when you, then you". Like my 5-year-old daughter on the porch, "When you get your boots on, then you can have your cellphone back." You know, of course I'd never let my 5-year-old use a cellphone but you get the point. When you, then you. Really important lesson. One of the cool things is my daughter who's 26 says the same thing as when she was 15 and that is she says, "Dad, one of the things I love about you is you never yell." She forgot. She forgot but it's because I made a new plan and I had support and it was based on a loving relationship that I had with her. 

00:13:30
John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. That Dog Don't Hunt 

00:13:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN One more story. This is a story that, uhm, illustrates how much parents need people like you to work with them, to collaborate with them, to have empathy with, to validate with them in ways so that they feel more positive about their parenting. Years ago, probably 14-year-old boy, ah, mom brings him to counseling because his dad, he and dad are really not speaking and they don't have much for a relationship left. I'd seen him a few times and I'd never met the dad but one day I went to an IEP meeting, Individual Education Plan, at the school and, uhm, the dad was there. I thought, "All right. Hey, my chance." I'd a little chit-chat with him, I wanted to make a connection. I sat next to him in the group meeting and at some point in the group meeting, uhm, I decided to ask the, the boy a projective question. I said, "Who would you-- if you got an A on the test, who would you show it to first?" And he said, "My dad, and my mom, and my special ed teacher." I said, "Wow! Cool." And I turn to dad and I said, "You know, that's a sign of how important you are in your child's life. I wanna invite you to come up for counseling." He gave me a look that was frightening, he got his hand on my shoulder, he pushed me. I don't really have people who pushed me much in my life. He then ranted for 2 minutes straight about how the school had failed his son and blah-blah then he turns back to me and he's just frothing and he says, "And I'll come up there for counseling. I've been in counseling before, I'll do it again." I'm thinking, "Can I just retract this? Is there any way for me to pull back this offer?" But he came and he and his son were still not talking so I had to ne-- meet with them separately and then, ah, he was actually pretty cooperative and I remember talking with him and I said, "You know, ah, some of the things that you're doing, it seems like you have high standards and this and that and he says to me, "Well, that dog don't hunt so I'm willing to give it a shot," and I'm-- didn't really quite understand what he said. But what it meant was that he's willing to give it a shot or to try out whatever it was that I was gonna suggest. And so I have-- I said, "I got three suggestions for you. Number one, do you love your son?" He said, "Yeah. I love my son." I said, "Well, everyday I want you to tell him that. Say I love you." And he said to me, "I usually leave that to the wife but, ah, yeah, I, I can do that." And I said, "Okay, number two. Ah, I want you to touch your son everyday in some kind of loving and gentle way." And he said to me, "Like give him a hug?" I said, "Yeah. Exactly. Give him a hug." He said, "I usually leave that to the wife too but I'll give that a shot." I said, "Okay, number three, do something fun. Do something fun with your fun, recreational activity once a week. But it's gotta be something he likes not just something you like." He says, "Ah, we both like to do four-wheeling so we'll do that together and it'll be great. No problem." So he left with his son, they had about an hour drive and I thought to myself, "Probably a quiet hour-long drive back." The next day in the afternoon I got a call from the mom and she was ecstatic. She was super happy. And she said, "I don't know what you said to them, I don't know what you did, but they're talking again." And I said, "That's great. That's cool." And she goes, "And you know what? This morning, at breakfast, I was in the other room and they were in the kitchen and I thought I heard him a hug." You probably see this is a mom listening pretty closely. And then she said, "And I saw my son walk down the driveway on his way to school and, ah, there were tears rolling down his cheeks." And I learned a couple of things from this and I learned, number one, how important it is to reconnect the kids with their parents. This is a boy who really needed to get reconnected with his dad. And I also learned that, uhm, no matter how gruff the parent seems, if you can sometimes just give them some direct guidance on how to do some really basic things for parents, it can be helpful. Now, things got better, way better for this kid. He no longer-- I mean, he, he, he didn't get straight As but he no longer got straight Fs and he and his parents had a better relationship and he and his dad were, were doing much better after, uhm, a year after the counseling. 

00:18:05
Final Thoughts 

00:18:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so I have a very simple final thought to this particular talk and that is I hope that this talk has inspired you to want to acquire the knowledge and the skills that it takes to work effectively with parents. And the reason I want this is because I know if you do it, their children will thank you and I thank you. 

00:18:40
THERAPY Talks 

00:18:45
SHANNON DERMER Thank you for that talk and, ah, working with parents. Ah, you, you did a different therapy talk, uhm, on working with adolescents. Who do you find it more challenging to work with, parents or adolescents? 

00:18:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, you know, I used to be terribly afraid to work with parents. Ah, they intimidated me, uhm, I remember feeling very insecure about it cuz you know they can be pretty angry. They're critical consumers, you know, parents. I-- that's my phrase for them, "critical consumers." They're very invested in things. Uhm, and I learned, ah, to actually like working with parents, I was the executive director of, ah, Parent Education Organization for 8 years and although I'm, I'm avoiding your question, - 

00:19:25
SHANNON DERMER You are. 

00:19:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN - ah, I would say that I love both. And the reason I love both is that, that parents-- I mean, I've had a dad who tell me that, "I wonder if we're gonna get in the fist fight," when we go in the office. And 1 minute later he says, "I'd like to cooperate anyway I can." And he says, "You know what? I grew up in a family that fought all the time and there was yelling and I hated it." The transformation with parents, once they recognize that, you know, you're really on their side is amazing. And, and I think is somewhat true for, for teenagers, uhm, but I think the transformation is even faster with parents if you can make a connection. 

00:20:05
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:20:05
SHANNON DERMER No, that's true. And actually, uhm, you know, my background is marriage and family therapy and I actually-- I would avoid the question too and, ah, I like working with them both. 

00:20:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. 

00:20:15
SHANNON DERMER You know, I like working with them both together. I mean, sometimes I might separate it. I only work with the parents - 

00:20:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:20:20
SHANNON DERMER - and only work with the adolescent but I think it's great to be able to work with, ah, both parts of that system. 

00:20:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. I think sometimes you can divide the system up and really be creative in how you work with the subsystems, of course. Uhm, but, yeah, there's-- ah, it's hard to be family therapy when you can get everybody in the room to be constructive. Sometimes I find that it doesn't always work best first and so then I might do a consultation with parents and just stay with that or just work individually with teenager or younger kid. 

00:20:50
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. It's, ah, it's true that when I think back to some of my, uhm, most difficult but also in the end most fun and rewarding cases it's been with parents. 

00:21:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:21:00
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:21:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I remember a dad that I was working with, uhm, and it was actually a parenting class. It was a divorced class and he had to come. He was mandated by the court. And we're going around doing the introductions and he-- we get to him and he says, "My name is blah-blah-blah, I got a 12-year-old daughter. I don't need no stupid ass parenting class," you know. And I, I remember in that moment like thinking, "Nanny, nanny, nanny, yes you do." I mean, I wa-- I mean, I was, I was getting my buttons push but somehow I managed to stay focused and I said to him, I said, "You know, thank you so much for coming. You must really love your daughter." One smoothly after that. "You must really love your daughter to come to this stupid ass parenting class, right?" You know, and he was so nice afterwards. He called me like a week later in tears and said, "Thank you for the class. I hung up the certificate. My daughter saw it. When she saw it, she gave me a hug and said, 'Thank you, Daddy.'" 

00:21:55
SHANNON DERMER Ah. 

00:21:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, and it was just like another example of terrible gruff parent loves his daughter so much. 

00:22:00
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. D-- did you ring and meet the stupid ass parenting class? 

00:22:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Ah, that's-- it would have been a good title. It would attracted a lot of people I think. 

00:22:10
SHANNON DERMER You could have name this Therapy Talk. 

00:22:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That's right. That's right. 

00:22:15
SHANNON DERMER No, it's true that I found that, uhm, some of the most contentious, gruff parents are actually the ones that love their, their kids the most and so are so upset by their children not doing well or not having a good relationship with them but they also can't see that being stuck in that contentiousness actually keeps that relationship with that. 

00:22:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. Right. 

00:22:35
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:22:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN They have so much passion and then they recognize it. You know, if you live with anger, it just does not-- it's not a useful approach. You live with anger and you scare everybody away. 

00:22:45
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:22:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I remember trying to work with a lot of divorced dads about that. It's like no, live with - 

00:22:50
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:22:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN - I, I, I feel hurt. 

00:22:50
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:22:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Or live with I'm concern. 

00:22:55
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:22:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But trying to live with that anger cuz-- but they're so passionate. You're right. You, you can transform that sometimes into really constructive energy. 

00:23:00
SHANNON DERMER Yes. I was thinking of some of my, ah, most famous cases in my mind and one of them was this women that I never thought she was gonna change her relationship with her, uhm, child and they were so contentious that actually the-- ah, I had the adolescent not come - 

00:23:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:23:15
SHANNON DERMER - but it was, uhm, ah, the parent was like, "How do I force her to come?" And I'm like, "Well, don't just-- we'll keep this secret between the two of us." So she wants to know what's going on in therapy, she didn't come but otherwise this is something between me and you. 

00:23:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:23:25
SHANNON DERMER And, ah, I remember asking her at my background is solution focus, - 

00:23:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:23:30
SHANNON DERMER - the miracle question. 

00:23:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:23:30
SHANNON DERMER And, ah, I asked the mom and she answered it and I said, "Well, if your daughter was here, how would she answer that question?" She's like, "She wouldn't. She wouldn't answer you." And you know, the miracle is just imagine a miracle has happened and all that, you know, like you should be able to answer that question but she was so stuck in seeing her daughter that way. And so then I-- as like rebellious and obstinate. So then I said, "Well, like, what if we-- I don't know, we held her down and tickle her so she had to answer?" She's like, "She's not ticklish." And I'm like, "Oh my goodness." So I give it one last try and it was like, "What if you held her down and I shot her with truth serum so she had to answer." 

00:24:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Nice. 

00:24:05
SHANNON DERMER And she's like, "Oh, well then, she would say" it was until we like there was a way we forced her daughter to cooperate - 

00:24:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:24:10
SHANNON DERMER - but that her approach toward her daughter, always trying to force her daughter to cooperate. And actually later on through a lot of steps which I won't take up our time, we actually got it to what you were talking about was approaching her daughter with kindness and showing how much she care and empathy rather than trying to force her to cooperate cuz that never works with a teenager, does it? Or parent as a matter of fact. 

00:24:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN For all thing. You know, put your hand out, if I push what do you wanna do? 

00:24:35
SHANNON DERMER Push back. 

00:24:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Push back. Yeah. Yeah. And so-- that's a really cool story about how you manage to break her out of her rigid thinking. 

00:24:40
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:24:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Truth serum. That's a great idea. 

00:24:45
SHANNON DERMER It was only thing that-- I'm like, "This is the last thing I have in my bag of tricks. 

00:24:45
John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. 

00:24:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. It was the truth serum technique. 

00:24:50
SHANNON DERMER Yes. 

00:24:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It goes right with the miracle question. Miracle question and truth serum. 

00:24:50
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. Yeah. But that's how stuck she was and that's how stuck-- it sounds like some of these parents are toward their kids but you're actually talking about how stuck they in how they see counseling too. And that you use what you're asking the parents to use. You're modeling. I'm gonna come at you with connection instead of seeing you as being resistant. 

00:25:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You are really smart cuz that's actually one of the exact things, you know. We need to be aware of the parallel process, you know, and that we need to treat our parents in counseling the same way that we would want the parent to treat their children and so it is absolutely modeling. 

00:25:25
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. You know, we'll, uhm, and it's easy for us to become obstinate parent with our obstinate parents. 

00:25:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Easy to be reactive. I mean, some of the things that pushed my buttons and that's another part of, ah, what we have in our book about, you know, How to Listen So Parents Will Talk is that you've got to really be aware of your buttons with parents cuz they'll come in-- I remember, one of the ones for me is I think my, I think my, uhm, my son is evil. 

00:25:50
SHANNON DERMER Oh. 

00:25:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So hard to get around then. I have parents who come in and say, "I'm, I'm gonna disown my son because, ah, he's gay." It's like, "Oh my!" You know, how do you find a place to accept and have empathy for that? You know, and what I have found is a lot like teenagers that there's initial posturing - 

00:26:10
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:26:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN - in the parents. As long as you accept that initial posturing I've had a dad say, "I believe in discipline. If I had said that's my kids I had no-- I get knocked down." Or if my dad-- if I had said it's my dad, I get knocked down. And I said, "Oh, yes. So you really believe in that?" And I said, "You know, but I'm, I'm not really into the knocking down." He goes, "Oh, neither I. Neither am I but I'm just saying." And so if you can listen first, a lot of time they can come back around out of their rigid mindset. 

00:26:35
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:26:35
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, and I agree. And actually except for if, you know, with few exceptions of people who are truly, you know, pathological in some ways, most parents if they're being abusive they're doing it because they want the best for their child, they want their kid to listen, they want their kid to be respectful, they want their child to do well in school, that they're-- they may be doing it for a good reason but not in good way. 

00:26:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:26:55
SHANNON DERMER And so you-- they connect with the reason not the way. 

00:27:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, and that's what I-- we write about that a lot too, is join with the goals of the parents, right? 

00:27:05
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:27:05
John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. 

00:27:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Don't join with the strategy. A lot of parents are using really terrible strategies to get their goals and that. And so resonate and join with those goals and then help them change their strategies so that it's more of a kind and loving strategy and a more effective strategy. 

00:27:20
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. Well, I think, uhm, we only have a couple of minutes but I think one of the difficult things is that when you told your story about, you know, yelling at your daughter or the exorcist whisper that, uhm, it works in the short-run and so it gets reinforced in parents. But in the long-run what does it create? 

00:27:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Ah, one of my colleagues developed a class, they only listen when I yell and other parenting myths. 

00:27:45
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:27:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So it's a myth because they're listening all the time. They're absolutely listening all the time and so they're-- they picked up on the fact that you're not serious until you yell. 

00:28:00
SHANNON DERMER You're right. You've trained them that. 

00:28:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN We've trained them to only respond when we yell. They are listening the whole time. And so if parents can re-develop their approach so that they give clear signals without yelling and then they'll do and act in consequence and it might mean a time out, it might mean a loss of a privilege, it might some kind of direct consequence or, you know, the-- I learned to what they say logical consequence, - 

00:28:25
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:28:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN - right? And so we wanna do that immediately and a natural consequence and then they'll be much more likely to respond to those earlier cues and of course - 

00:28:35
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:28:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN - basic rule. If you've said a third time, that's it. If you say it fourth time, you've lost your power cuz then you're angry. 

00:28:45
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:28:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And then they won't response till you yell. 

00:28:45
SHANNON DERMER Well, are, uhm, viewers today, ah, we didn't have to yell, they've been listening the whole time. 

00:28:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN They have been. 

00:28:50
