Supporting People with Chronic Pain Presented by Richard Hill 

00:00:20
RICHARD HILL Have you ever had a period in your life when, the main thing you recall from it was the relentless pain? What about a period when you were a caregiver for somebody with chronic pain? I'm Richard Hill, and this is a talk about supporting those who are dealing with chronic pain. Whether the person supported is the one with the pain, or the caregiver, to the one with the pain. Over the next 45 minutes or so, we'll be defining chronic pain, and suggesting some of its causes, explaining the roles of the nervous and immune systems in creating chronic pain, and outlining the treatment options for dealing with it. And we'll finish with a brief look at rights, responsibilities, and expectations a person with chronic pain should have of the health team helping with the management of their pain.

00:01:20
RICHARD HILL But first, what is chronic pain? The organization, Chronic Pain Australia, talks about it as "pain that extends beyond the expected healing time of an injury, or can accomb-, accompany chronic illness such as arthritis or lupus." Whether your experience of it was as a person in pain yourself, or, as a supporter of someone having long-term pain, you undoubtedly recognize what a drain on your resources it was to be involved in it. Now, that's true on a national level, too. A 2007 report by Access Economics, estimates the total cost of chronic pain in Australia at $34.3 billion, which equates to about $10,847 per person with chronic pain. This estimate is expected in increase over time. It breaks down to about $11.7 billion in lost productivity, $11.5 billion attributed to the burden of disease, and $7 billion of health system costs, including hospitals and medical costs, as well as pharmaceuticals, other professional services, and residential aged care. The situation is similar in the United States, where chronic pain has been said to be the most costly health problem, with estimates of annual costs around $100 billion. The three chief sources for it are lower back pain, affecting nearly 85 percent of people at some stage, cancer pain, with about 1.4 million cases of new cancer diagnosed every year, and arthritis pain, which affects some 66 million people in the US. Further, a Chronic Pain Australia survey showed that, out of 600 respondents, 93 percent were workforce age - that's, you know, between 20 and 65 - and a whopping 97 percent experienced pain at levels of at least 5 out of 10, with 10 being constant pain. Fully 44 percent reported having constant pain. With such high percentages and so high a cost, you might be wondering, 'What causes pain?' Well, I wish the answer was simple. Th-, there are a few points, here, wh-, which will help us to understand how the, the chronic pain response gets going. So, point one: Anyone can develop chronic pain. It commonly affects all the adults and people with health conditions, such as arthritis, cancer, back problems, multiple sclerosis, and diabetes. Point two:... 

00:04:10

00:04:10
RICHARD HILL People can have identical injuries or conditions, but experience very different levels of pain. Medical science doesn't really know whether it's culture, genes, or just individual difference, that cause one person to be very susceptible for feeling pain, while another has a relatively high threshold for experience it, although genetics is increasingly suspected and being looked at. Point three: There are psychological causes of pain, now known to be an untreated consequence of depression, anxiety, grief, unexpressed anger, and emotional overwhelm. Point four: Chronic pain frequently sets the sufferer up for a complex set of physical and psycho-social changes that are at the heart of the chronic pain problem. These secondary changes add greatly to the person's burden of pain. These include: Immobility and, uh, consequent wasting of muscles and joints; depression of the immune system - and, we'll talk more about that in a moment - but increased susceptibility to se-, to disease; upset in sleep; appetite and nutrition issues; there's dependence on medication is a big issue; over-dependence on family and other caregivers creates huge problems; repeated and/or inappropriate use of health care services; poor job performance, or inability to work at all; and withdrawal from friends and family; anxiety and/or fear; bitterness, frustration, and depression. Really, chronic pain is a major risk factor of suicide, and this, and all those factors, make chronic pain a very serious problem. 

00:06:10

00:06:10
RICHARD HILL Now with our points, point five, now: Nearly half - that's 40 percent of cra-, pon-, chronic pain sufferers in Australia, say that their pain is the result of a diagnosed condition, such as multiple sclerosis, cancer, or some inflammatory condition. And additional 40 percent say that their chronic pain has been the quanti-, uh, consequence of some event, such as an operation or an accident-related illness. But 13 percent of chronic pain sufferers says they have no identified medical reason for their pain. Point six: With so many possible causes, the precise cause of pain can be difficult to pinpoint. Moreover, whatever the original cause, pain can persist because of stress, emotional problems, improper treatment, or ongoing abnormal pain signals in the body. And really, what I, I think is possibly the worst of them is point seven: That pain can occur without previous injury, illness, or known cause, and even when it occurs from known diseases or illnesses, chronic pain may carry on long after the disease has been controlled or cured. So, to understand chronic pain and help someone move beyond it, we must examine two bodily systems, which greatly affect the experience of pain.

RICHARD HILL The next time you get a client with ongoing pain - someone who has experienced high levels of stress and emotion - you could look the person straight in the eye and say, "You are causing the pain with your thoughts and emotions. Stop it right now!" Well, actually, hopefully you won't do that, but, uh, you know, it's not a very good psychotherapy. But actually, you wouldn't be inaccurate in saying that thoughts, feelings, and emotions all have impacts on the nervous system, to affect chronic pain. And this is important to understand, so, here's an insight into how this happens. 

00:08:20
PAIN AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM SENSITIZATION: OFF-BALANCE CHEMISTRY AIPC LECTURE SERIES SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN 

00:08:25
[sil.] 

00:08:25
RICHARD HILL In a process called 'central nervous system sensitization,' the nervous system receives chemicals produced by the body, as we respond cognitively and affectively to events in our perceptions, of our environment - both inner and outer. Some of the chemicals produced calm down the system, inhibiting the pain reaction, and others excite the system, stimulating the pain response. The pain experience is related to these ascending and descending messages, and also, those involving processing, centralization, in the spinal cord, itself.

00:09:10
RICHARD HILL Messages ascending to the brain. Messages ascend to the brain, via the spinal cord, about damage or threat to the tissues. And sometimes, the nerve transmits messages to the brain about their health, and this is called 'neuropathic, or neurogenic pain.' Pain centralized in the nervous system. Within the spinal cord, the central nervous system can become highly sensitive to stimuli coming both from within the body and outside of it, in this process - the central nervous system sensitization, I just referred to. The nervous system adapts, becoming like a high-quality amplifier. The analogy with the pain experience is that, of the w-, well, a lot like the princess, in, in the fairytale who could feel the pea, placed under the 20 mattresses. The person's system becomes so aware of stimuli that even low-key events, not noticed by other people, like chronic pain sufferers do, are perceived as painful. Messages descending from the brain. Fibers coming down from the brain, via the spinal cord, involve the sympathetic nervous system - that's our emergency 'fight or flight' response - and also, the parasympathy, parasympathetic, the endocrine, immune, and motor systems. Now, these systems are functionally bound with resting, digestion, hormone production, defense, and movements. The nerve fibers associated with each system, make a contribution to the pain experience. Normally, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system work to find a balance with each other, so that we can functionally, uh, function in an optimally way, in response to our environment. This is the autonomic nervous system as a whole. What we also need is a way to let the brain know when nerves or other tissues have been damaged - uh, what we call an 'insult' - so that the brain can try to sort out a repair job. And we also want the body to know when the brain has detected danger, so that it can respond protectively or defensively by pairing us, preparing us to fight or fly, or raise in the level of defense and the immune system, to keep out the potential unwanted biological invaders. This is a big role, here, of the sympathetic nervous system. SO let's imagine this: You are the parent of a young child. You're happily walking along the footpath with your toddler, when she breaks free from your hand, and, and darts off into the street, just at the precise moment that a car comes around the corner at breakneck speed. The young hood at the wheel fails to see your daughter and worst case scenario, stops the car an instant too late, running her over. In complete shock, you run out to the car, unbelievably, to all those who witness it, you rescue the child by lifting up the car. Well, that's sounds amazing, it sounds miraculous, and it may be, but, in fact, there are recorded instances of this very thing happening. The 'miracle' lifting of that car by a single person, is by courtesy of that sympathetic system. The part of us that allows us to respond to emergencies by distributing the stress hom-, hormone adrenaline, and also other chemicals, such as the pain-masking endorphins. The adrenaline gives us a, a shot of turbo-charged oxygen, which activates the muscles, dilates the pupils, and, in a way, helps us to become super human, in order to take care of the emergency. With long term stress, however, the picture begins to look a bit different. So, let's change the scene, now, and imagine that your daughter makes a, a full recovery from being run over - she's healthy and happy. Excellent. One day, however, a terrible illness comes over her slightly older brother - fevered and listless, he lies in his bed, unable to do terribly much. For weeks, you sit by his side, caring for him, trying to make him comfortable. Now, your 'fight or flight' hormones, those immediate response hormones, they may not be helping, because the body cannot stay at a level of red alert for long periods of time. If the situation causing stress - your son's illness, in this case - does not clear up and is not dealt with, then, one of the other main stress hormones we produce, called 'cortisol' eventually begins to cause damage to both brain and body. You can eventually become sick yourself. Descending fibers: the chemical transporters. The descending fibers, coming from the brain, transport chemicals to the spinal cord, just as other chemicals are coming up, from the body. The chemicals meet and mix, putting it rather simply, but, they meet and mix and if there are more stimulating chemicals than inhibitory ones, the person has relatively more pain. If it's the other way around, the person experiences relatively less pain. The nervous system's role in the experience of chronic pain is thus crucial, but it's not the only player in the game. There's also impacts from the immune system.

RICHARD HILL Like the nervous system, the immune system is set up to protect us, responding to anything that it deems a threat. It works by releasing chemicals which attack invaders. The chemical triggers inflammation, which can feel hot and cause swelling, and even superficial redness. The immune system, then, works in further ways to protect us. On the positive side, the chemicals responsible for the inflammation make the surrounding area much more sensitive, which reduces a person's desire to use or move that area, thus, ensuring that the injured or sick part is allowed to rest and recuperate. Similarly, to the nervous system chemicals released in the 'fight or flight' response, the chemicals brought forward by the immune system are a great aid to healing, in the short term. But when the inflammation becomes long-term, the immune system becomes overactive and hypersensitive, responding to many innocent substances, as if they were threats. We simply have not yet evolved ways to manage long-term inflam-, inflammation, and this can result in autoimmune issues, making people ill with diseases such as ulcerative colitis, and rhemiti-, rheumitoidal arthritis, asthma, and that's not the end of immune system's effect on us. There is also the situation that the spinal cord immune system becomes active. The immune system contributes to spinal sensitization - the central nervous system sensitization we've just described. So, even if the inflamed area is a person's big toe, she may have inflammation from that showing up in the spine, causing pain to spread and worsen, more than would be affected for such a localized injury. The release of these chemicals into the spine causes a number of symptoms, uh, fever, fatigue, sleepiness, malaise, loss of appetite, loss of libido, social withdrawal, irritability, and a heightened sensitivity to everyday activities, causing increased pain. This group of symptoms, called 'the sickness response,' or, sometimes referred to as 'sickness behavior,' and it can be triggered by many stressors, including: physical stress, as when one pushes one's body too hard, say, by overdoing exercise; long-term use of codeine of high-di, high doses of morphine; nervous system injuries and infections; ongoing stress, such as being involved in a legal case or caring for a long-term chronically ill family member, or as Robert Sapolsky says, "the 30-year mortgage." After hearing how the body's systems collude to spread pain's influence, you may very well be wondering w-, w-, what medical science or alternative health systems could come up with, that would counter pain? Although it's important to remember that pain is a normal mechanism to getting our attention and eliciting our response, this is a good thing. But there is good news, and it is on two counts: One, there are a wrath of treatments and techniques to help manage pain. Two, many of them involve training the mind of the sufferer to think differently - skills, at which counselors excel. So, you can make a positive contribution in a chronic sufferer's, uh, chronic pain sufferer's management. Let's see the range of treatments a chronic pain management might have available, and then focus on the psychological support and coping techniques, in which you are likely to be able to participate.

Treatment modalities for chronic pain AIPC Lecture Series Supporting People with Chronic Pain 

00:19:05
Medication 

00:19:05
RICHARD HILL Some of the usual options for chronic pain management include medication, physiotherapy, electrical stimulation, uh, neurostimulation, surgery, and the complementary therapies, including psychological support. For many people, medication is probably the first port of call. Doctors may try several combinations of drugs, and, and dosage, before feeling satisfied that they are giving the patient the most effective treatment. Pain relieving drugs can be delivered orally, rectally, transdermal, or as an injection, which could be intravenous, subcutan-, subcutaneous, or intramuscular.

Physiotherapy

00:19:50
RICHARD HILL Physiotherapy. Injury goes hand in hand with restricted mobility, with implications for pain and consequent quality of life, so, physiotherapy aims to bring about controlled movement and exercise of painful body parts, in order to restore function to stiff joints and muscles. Physiotherapists help clients by assessing movement, and strength, endurance, and other physical abilities. Assessing the impact of an injury. Evaluating a person's readiness to return to work or sports. Educating people about how to restore movement and reduce pain. Customizing treatment for injury or disability. Physiotherapy is principally active, involving exercises and postural-gained correction. But also effective are passive therapies, such as remedial massage therapy, and, even hot or cold pads are very effective. Electrical stimulation/neurostimulation. When a client has pain in specific areas of the body, electrical stimulation, also known as neurostimulation, can help reduce the pain through stimulation devices such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation - called 'TENS', T.E.N.S. 'TENS.' These work well when applied with electrodes on the skin, next to the painful area. The electrodes are connected to a neurostimulation device, which is usually bant-, battery operated and worn on one's belt. Alternatively, TENS devices, which we can think of as 'pain pacemakers' can be surgically implanted, giving the electrical stimulation more direct access to the nervous system. Surgery.

00:21:55
Surgery 

00:21:55
Complementary therapies. 

00:21:55
RICHARD HILL Doctors tend to support less invasive treatments, before resorting to invasive surgery. Uh, this is an option that generally occurs, after other treatments have failed. Surgery can provide pain relief by correcting an underlying problem, such as a, a structural back problem - a bulging disc. When the cause of pain is clearly mechanical, for example, a, a disc irritating a nerve or scar tissue obstructing a valve, surgery can be the best option. Sadly, there are cases of surgeries which have resulted in little or no pain relief. This just adds to the chronic pain patient's frustration and despair. It's a very difficult situation. Complementary therapies. In addition to medication, physiotherapy, neurostimulation, and surgery, there are a growing number of allied health treatments, sometimes used in conduction, uh, conjunction with other therapies, that are doing a reasonable amount of good help. Chiropractors, osteopaths, and acupuncturists have helped with pain relief, along with therapists using massage, reiki, homeopathy, uh, hypnosis, naturopathy, and foot reflexology. If you have the opportunity to assist a chronic pain patient in assembling or managing a healthcare team, you may provide valuable help by ensuring that the pain sufferer knows about all these options, and how each could work to support him or her.

Psychological support AIPC Lecture Series Supporting People with Chronic Pain 

00:23:35
1 out of 5 survey respondents had considered suicide 

00:23:40
RICHARD HILL Pain can have a profound social and psychological impact on those who suffer from it and also those who care for them. Sufferers can become dependent upon medication and over-reliant on their families and other caregivers. Those seeking relief from long-term pain can be inappropriate in their repeated utilization of healthcare services and anxious and fearful, even when tended to. Because pain is invisible, well, particularly to those not suffering, chronic pain patients are frequently stigmatized as well, in an online survey of over 2,500 Australian adults, 58 percent of respondents responded that other people sometimes doubted the reality of their pain. 1 out of 5 survey respondents had considered suicide. So pervasive was their, their bitterness, their frustration, their depression. So, you ask, what can you do? A mental health helper, helper, uh, wh-, what can you do for such a client? Talk therapy does not always have the same quick response time as, say, a painkilling medication, but it can be hugely effective in helping the chronic pain client come to a place of acceptance, and opening the door to establishing a new life - one which accommodates the changes that have occurred. You look at both psychotherapy and cognitive, cognitive therapy - including techniques for working with ones' mind and attention - to change the relationship with the pain.

Psychotherapy: Getting at the roots of the pain AIPC Lecture Series Supporting People Chronic Pain 

00:25:25
RICHARD HILL Even the most conservative of medical practitioners are coming to acknowledge the close interaction between our body and our thoughts and emotions. Yet, chronic pain clients are often reluctant to explore the possibility that their pain is, has an emotional root. Part of the stigma may lie in the sufferer's fear that they will be accused of making up the symptoms or causing them on purpose. Yet, that's not how true somatizing works. The pain is real, and often results from unexpressed emotions, literally frozen or stuck in the body. Emotions release large amount of chemicals into the muscles and organs, and the longer they stay there, the more pain and problems they cause. The pain is just as real as any caused by medical condition. And also, people tend to dislike acknowledging, even to themselves, that their pain might be, might be psychogenic, because doing so deprives them of the hope that there'll be a medical cure. Instead, if the pain is psychological in origin, they must face the challenging emotions that they have avoided in dealing with in the first place - the ones that caused the pain. Facing these emotional challenge, well, these challenges can generally provide relief in the short term, and in the long term, but unfortunately, if emotions have been held for very long time in the body, they become primarily physical symptoms. And in this case, even with catharsis, chronic pain may not go away very easily. So, in addition to working with emotions, you have the possibility of helping chronic pain clients via a powerful tool, their minds, focused appropriately through cognitive therapy and mindfulness training.

00:27:25
RICHARD HILL Cognitive therapy and its associates, cognitive behavioral therapy and REBT, uh, relational emotive behavioral therapy, place thoughts and the emotions that come with them, at center stage of a person's potential for well-being. Sessions of psychotherapy look into the client's past to explore how unfinished business with others, and unexpressed emotions are driving pain from underground - from the subconscious. Meanwhile, the cognitive therapies help people discover which thoughts and consequent, uh, emotions, in the 'here and now,' are causing pain and impairing clients' ability to live as fully as possible, given the illness or injury that they may have. Changing the way a person thinks may not render him or her pain- free, but this sort of therapy shows people how to change their relationship to the paid, reducing it, and becoming less affected by it, thereby enhancing a person's effectiveness and contentment. If you're using any sort of cognitive therapy with a chronic pain client, you're likely to be helping the person learn to cope with their lives and their pain by teaching them a number of things: To think more realistically about their pain and other life phenomena; to relax more deeply than they did before; to manage their activities, given that they have this pain; to solve problems related to their pain and other life stresses. You'd be likely to start with a, a focus on pain management, and move, move from there to other issues or concerns. The primary target for change is the client's negative and unrealistic thoughts, images, and the emotions about their pain - the consequences of having it, and where these are stressful. So, what are some coping techniques to enhance your client's capacity for positive, uh, realistic, more compassionate self-talk and beliefs?

00:29:50
RICHARD HILL If you have only had minimal training in cognitive therapies, you know that people shape their lives by the beliefs, thoughts, and expectations that they hold. Albert Ellis' ABC Program - coming from the school of rational, emotive behavioral therapy - can be enormously helpful to people in pain. Let's take the case of 'Joan.' Now, she's an active, 73-year-old. She recovered quickly from her first hip replacement, but at age 77, when she needed to get the other hip done, she was in a, unfortunately, a victim of medical misadventure. Dirty hip replacement parts used in the procedure caused a huge infection, and the legacy of having to have this second hip redone was chronic hip pain. Well, earlier, she'd always managed to think positive, positively, she now descended into the misery of believing that she would never feel better. Joan eventually went to counseling for help. Her counselor helped her to identify the 'A' of the ABC paradigm - the 'activating event.' So, the 'A' is the culmination in hopeless thought. For Joan, that event occurred when she had a day during which she could not get on top of the pain. Joan originally thought that her feelings of despair were a direct result of the pain itself. The counselor worked with her to understand how, in fact, Joan's hopelessness was mediated by an underlying 'B,' or belief, which ran something like, 'No matter what I do, I will be in pain. I will never get better.' The 'C,' or consequent emotion, of despair then followed. Joan began to practice becoming conscious of her belief, whenever she experienced unrelenting pain. She learned to correct her 'B' replacing it with a more hopeful thought. And for Joan, that ran something like this, 'This may be challenging, but every day, I am healing from this procedure.' That belief, correcting on her part, is called the 'D,' added later to the paragon, uh, the paradigm, for 'disputation,' so really, ABCD. Joan was disputing her unhelpful belief in order to alleviate her hip pain. It didn't happen overnight, but it did happen.

Distraction and attention: Closing the pain pathways AIPC Lecture Series Supporting People with Chronic Pain 

00:32:35
Fact 1: Focusing on pain means more pain 

00:32:35
Fact 2: Attention is finite 

00:32:35
Fact 3: Attention is like a muscle 

00:32:35
RICHARD HILL Managing thoughts by actively replacing limited ones, is a solid tool for pain clients to use. Yet, there are also other ways clients can mainta-, manage their pain, through managing their minds. Here are three facts, which, taken together, can constitute a strong case for distracting ourselves from pain by putting attention elsewhere. Fact one: Focusing on pain means more pain. As I noted in discussing the relationship between pain and the central nervous system, the way we focus our attention has a lot to do with how much pain we experience. This is because, every sensation of pain, which registers on our consciousness sends a signal through our pain pathways. The more signals we send, that is, the more thoughts focused on the pain, the more pain receptors our nerves create to handle all the signals. These signals are biochemical - they're not just magical thoughts - they're biochemicals, and the more receptors we have, the more sensitive our nerves become leading to central nervous system sensitization, which we described before. The more sensitivity we have, the more pain we experience. The more pain we experience, the more bad thoughts we have, and there we have a vicious, maintaining cycle. Attention is finite. You can help your clients to interrupt the cycle if you get them to think about it like this, each of us has a finite amount of attention to give to our various life experiences. The more we give to one area, the less attention there is available for others. Putting major amounts of attention into one's pain, therefore means much less attention for anything else. By inserting pleasurable experiences to our lives, we increase our production of the so-good, the feel chem-, feel good chemicals, and the neurotransmitters, such as the endorphins. With a high percentage of attention on our enjoyable experiences, we're emotionally and chemically reducing our pain. Attention is like a muscle. Attention can be strengthened by using it, and it can be directed to do the heavy lifting in whatever direction we require. Therefore, the name of the game in pain control is attention enhancement. Growing the capacity for attention, and then, directing that newly enhanced capacity to those experiences that generate feel good - that is, pain inhibiting chemicals - and, and, and thus limiting or closing the pain pathways formerly experienced. This means that we can help clients control their pain, when we help them to distract themselves from the pain, reducing pain signals, and add in enjoyable cent-, uh, sensations and experiences, facilitating the pro-, the, the production of pain inhibiting endorphins. When we help them grow their capacity for paying attention, they are even more powerful at regulating these processes. Now, mindfulness exercises and techniques will help them do this.

Exercise 4: Defusion practice: Developing the Observer Self 

00:36:10
RICHARD HILL Some of the most potent methods for developing the 'attention muscle,' reside in mindfulness. It's a practice hailing from ancient Buddhist and other Eastern traditions, but recently, is enjoying soaring popularity in the West. Mindfulness practices include both meditative and non-meditative ways of concentrating awareness and attention. Today, I'd like to give you several exercises from that course, uh, that you can use with clients to help them distract themselves from pain, while they grow their attention focused upon pleasant sensations. The exercises all encourage what mindfulness advocates called being with what is, or developing the 'Observer Self.' I'll speak the instructions addressed to the person practicing the mindfulness - say, your chronic pain client. Exercise one: Mindful eating. Sit down at the table with your food but no television, radio, book, computer, music, or conversation. Eat your meal, paying full attention to each bite - how it looks, how it smells, what is happening with your various muscles as you cut it and raise it to your mouth. Compare any differences you notice between food eaten this way and that eaten when you were focusing on other things. Meals eaten mindfully are more filling than others, and also very good for digestion. Exercise two: Mindful walking. You can do mindful walking in the same way that you do mindful eating. While walking, you focus on everything in and around you - the feel of the ground under your feet, your breathing, the sky, your view, the flowers, the trees, or, all the foliage along the route, the other walkers, the feel of the wind on your face and in your hair. The sun on your skin. If you lapse into thinking just thank your mind for its contribution, and go back to the experiencing the walk. Enjoy the outing. One minute of breath. In this exercise, your task is to devote a whole minute - measured by a clock or watch in front of you - to your breath. Nothing more and nothing less. Notice that what you observe about yourself at the end of the minute. As you develop your attention muscle, you may wish to gradually extend your mindfulness time of breath focus from one minute to more. Diffusion practice - developing the Observer Self. Mindfulness experts encourage development of the Observer Self as a core skill; to create the Observer Self, is to give oneself another perspective, and thus a more spacious psyche from which to be with incoming stimuli. So, if we, or our clients are experiencing profound pain, there is a sense of distancing ourselves from our pain, and thus, reducing it. If we're able to create a space from which we watch ourselves experiencing the pain, as mental health practitioner, you can work with clients to develop this capacity by encouraging them first to diffuse - to identify - with a given experience, say, the intense pain by sitting in, say, in a particular chair, which we will call 'the Painful Self.' The person should focus intensely on the experience, let's say it's one of the strong, lower back pain, uh, for about 10 to 20 seconds, noticing everything about the pain, mindfully - what it feels like: hot, tingly, sharp, throbbing, where it is, how big it is. Then you instruct the client to walk across the room to another chair - we'll call this one the, 'Observer Self' chair. From this second vantage point, the client is to mentally look back at the Painful Self, noticing how that self looks, what it seems to be going through, what it's thinking, and so on. Ask your client if he or she experiences any distancing from the pain, when in the second position. Is there any reduction in the sensation of pain? Having two places to put one's awareness, at the painful self, and also the Observer, Observer self, creates a more spacious psyche and a less intense pain experience. And there's yet another category of mindfulness that we can call on to reduce pain.

RICHARD HILL Because pain is an inherently unpleasant sensation, we're drawn to notice it. In fact, we often become mired in it, with most of our awareness consumed by our hurting stomach, toe, head, or whatever. Having our entire consciousness tied up with pain, well, it's miserable. So, you can use mindfulness training to increase the capacity to identify with and then disidentify at will, from a particular focus - the pain. Similarly learning to focus the attention on an image or a scene which is more pleasant, safe, or comfortable than the pain, allows some escape from its drudgery and overwhelm. This happens particularly, uh, or partially, through the production of pain inhibiting chemicals, as I noted through mindful thought, but whatever the target of awareness, such exercises help to reduce pain by distancing ourselves from it. The very act of learning to experience the Observer Self, that is, experience the part of ourselves that is pain, uh, that is not pain, gives the capacity to choose to be in pain, that is, identify with it, or not. That is, to relatively disidentify. And here are several exercises which help a person learn to direct awareness. Technique one: altered focus. This technique powerfully demonstrates how the mind can alter sensation in the body. Encourage your client to focus her attention on any specific non-painful part of her body, the foot, the hand, the buttocks, uh, uh, direct her to alter sensation in that part of the body, say, by imagining her hand warming up. This takes the mind away from focusing on the source of her pain - the sore back, or wherever else. Technique two: mental anesthesia. Here, the client uses his imagination to direct a numbing shot of anesthetic. For example, uh, the Novocain used by a dentist, into a painful area, such as a painful shoulder. Alternatively, he could imagine a cooling ice pack, soothing, say, an inflamed ankle joint. Once the patient is competent with mental anesthesia, you can build on it by having him mentally inject a strong painkiller, such as morphine, into the painful area. Similarly, the client could imagine his brain producing huge amounts of endorphins - natural pain relieving substance produced by the body - and having them flow to parts in the brain. And lastly, I'd like to remind you about the possibilities of pacing.

Pacing AIPC Lecture Series Supporting People with Chronic Pain 

00:44:25
RICHARD HILL Have any of your chronic pain clients prope-, protested that they can't do s-, 'X," something anymore, because they're too tired to do anything the next day, or perhaps, they fear reinjure. The irony of this stance is that by ceasing normal activities, people become demotivated and experience a weakening, or stiffening, of the muscles, which then creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. The person really does become able to do the activity. If the activity is one that is precious, or meaningful to the client, such as gardening or taking the grandchildren out for the day, then the person may be helped by pacing. Now, the central goal of this pain management technique is to be able to do the activities that are most important, by prioritizing them, and doing them in smaller segments. If the activity were a visit to the fun park, with the grandchildren, for example, the client would be well advised to get a park map beforehand and work out a route for going through the park where you could stop at cafes or other points of rest or, or pause, uh, between the various attractions. Obviously, it would also be important to communicate to the grandchildren that any expectations about the pace of the outing and how long it might last. And what insight the chronic pain clients may take away from the wrath of pain management techniques I've presented today is that they, the client, are responsible for, and to some degree, have some control over their pain. Which brings me to the last segment of this talk, that is for clients to know about their rights, their responsibilities, and expectations.

Right, responsibilities, and expectations AIPC Lecture Series Supporting People with Chronic Pain

RICHARD HILL The unfortunate truth for some people with chronic pain is that they do not wish to take an active role in their own healing. Such individuals possibly prescribe to the, the old, the medical model paradigm for healthcare, the livery which says, 'Doctor, fix me! Somebody, fix me!' You can remind such clients, or invite their caregivers to remind them, that while they can choose to do that, they will not realize the maximum benefits of their health expenditure. For this, they need to be aware of not only proposed treatments and what those will mean for them, but also what their rights and responsibility as a patient are. And they need to know how to manage expectations - both their own and those of the health providers. Let's just touch on a few of those. How clearly does your client, or your client's supportive person understand their rights to access professionals who are competent to deal with their illness? To be believed and treated with dignity and respect, have providers who are willing to work with them to find the best treatment solutions for them. ON the other hand, you may need to work with the pain patient, or the caregiver, to help them understand that they have responsibilities, if they would be a contributing team member, helping to work towards their own health. The patient's responsibility is always to ensure that they have the highest possible level of skills and understanding to deal with the issues, and to let the professionals know what is happening with them, with as much clarity and honesty as they can, so that the health system can be utilized effectively, and as effectively as possible for their treatment. Both sides, patient and professionals alike, will have expectations that need to be managed. The chronic pain sufferer will have many expectations, and probably not all of these will be conscious. For example, uh, a pain patient can realis-, realistically, uh, expect practitioners to act responsibly, ethically, and with respect. But yet, may also be holding unconscious expectations that the healthcare providers are the ones to do all the heavy lifting, towards improving their health. She may see herself as just, well, along for the ride. Your role may be to help the person and/or their caregiver, depending on who is your client, to make conscious as many expectations as possible, so they can be managed to become realistic and helpful to the overall healing.

Summary AIPC Lecture Series Supporting People with Chronic Pain 

00:49:40
RICHARD HILL This talk has examined chronic pain - it's chief causes, contributory roles played by the nervous system and the immune system. I've identified multiple consequences of living with chronic pain and named the principle types of treatments available to manage pain. One of those is psychological support, and we have shown how getting that through counseling can help lessen the experience of pain, through coaching on mind and pain control techniques, which have helped pain sufferers place their attention elsewhere. Chronic pain is not easy. The relentlessness of it grinds a person down, but with your help, clients may realize that, while some pain is inevitable, they have some choices about that unbearable suffering. With your help, either directly or to a caregiver, a chronic pain patient may ulta-, ultimately find a way to relaunch a life that has meaning and purpose and is, through effective management of pain, reinfused with that most healing element of all, hope.
