MARCUS GENTRY A recent survey was conducted. It was determined that 52% of Americans who were surveyed were experiencing physical health problems because of stress related matters. It was also determined that 59% of those said that they were doing an excellent job at recognizing if they were having any stress problems going on at all. But here is the interesting numbers. They say that only about 26% of those felt that they were doing a good job at not just recognizing them but preventing some of those stressful conditions and then, being able to successfully manage them. So, that brings up the issue, how do we successfully manage stressful matters when they come up? Because it’s obvious that its, if it’s not effecting you, it could be possibly effecting your clients or your friends or family members or neighbors. Something that everybody, on some level will be impacted with. So, let’s talk about it. what are some of the things that create stress that we know of? Relationships, financial issues, um, family matters, children, maybe physical concerns or weight issues. Or sometimes just being caught in traffic can create stress for some people, is that right? So, we know that these are some of the issues that we have to be concerned about, but, how do we actually manage that? Or wouldn’t it be wise if we first determined how we should define stress. With all the advances in technology, and everything that has been done so far, do you up until this point there have been no x-rays, no uh, surgeries, no MRIs, no CAT scans, no medical intrusive procedures done where they have been able to go in and find something inside of the body that they say, this is stress. And once we get this out, you’re gonna be much better. So then what actually is this stress, that’s causing all the problems? Well, for the sake of our brief conversation, why don’t we define it this way, as stress being an uncomfortable reaction to a stimulus. Something that happens, and we have an uncomfortable reaction to it. Whether its emotional, or whether it’s a physical reaction, well just use that for the sake of this time. So that means ultimately what we want to do it either change the situation, or change our thoughts. Now it’s much more involved than just doing that, isn’t it? We have to do a little bit more. I have condensed it in what I call, the triple A plan. As a system that we can use, that if you process things put it in perspective and proceed forward, it will help you be able to successfully manage a situation that could be very stressful for you. Processing, which means, asking yourself exactly what happened, not using assumptions, asking yourself, how does this make me feel, now that this event has actually happened? Put it in perspective, which means being able to find what's necessary to restore our emotional or even physical balance, and getting clarity about what resolution looks like. Does it mean that we are responsible for resolving this situation that’s creating stressful thoughts for us? Is it someone else's responsibility? In fact, what does success actually look like, in terms of this situation that we have identified, as being stressful for us? So, what I would like you to do, is think very personally about this as we, as we talk about it. because the next step obviously is to proceed forward, which means taking action and asking ourselves, what is it we are prepared to do and then being about the business of getting it done. Processing, proceeding, uh, putting it in perspective, and proceeding forward. But think very personally about examples that you may know, people that you may have worked with. Maybe even yourself personally. The triple A plan is the system we are going to talk about, and this system is actually used in every single crises management system that you'll find. Hospitals use it, um emergency rescue systems use it, the military uses it. It's basically assessing, making an adjustment, and then activating a plan, putting it in place. Now, all of this rest on a foundation. And you know the foundation that those three things rest on? Relaxing and breathing. Isn’t it important that we before we can start anything, before we can make a careful assessment, we have to first stop and just be still, and breathe. You know if you are not able to relax, if you are not able to breathe, sometimes you may rush in too quickly. Or, you may wait too long, or procrastinate, or not do what's necessary. So the first thing, we want to be able to relax and breathe and knowing how to do that ahead of time. It’s a skill isn’t it? When is the last time that you took a few minutes just for yourself to do nothing but relaxing, and breathing? The challenge comes in, when you haven’t practiced that skill, and a crisis comes up or a situation that comes up, and causes you stressful thoughts, you don’t have that to easily refer back to. So, what we encourage is to learn how to practice relaxing and breathing ahead of time, so that you can be able to successfully manage a situation when it comes up. Now, that brings us to the first A, of the triple A plan. Making the assessment. Unless you make a careful and proper assessment, you will not be able to devise a plan that will successfully resolve whatever the situation is that you're thinking about right now, or that your client might be thinking about, that they are having difficulty with. So, we have to take the time to assess. Now, there is about seven different points I am going to give you here to look at. The first one is this, ask yourself, or the client, the question, are you free enough to act in your own best interest? When it comes to resolving a problem or something that’s creating stress for you, are you free enough, now, you may say well of course a person would be free enough. They would want to act in their best interest but, when we examine it just a little closer, you know what we find? We find that many people are shackled to the opinion of others, and it prevents them from doing what they need to do. Sometimes a person knows exactly what it is they need to do to resolve an issue, but they won’t do it, or feel that they can’t do it because, well, what would my spouse think of me if I did that? And, well, what would my co-workers feel and, and what about the people at my church, what would they say? And, my children, what will they think? How about my friends? The neighbors? If I were to do this thing, that I actually believe I should do, that would resolve my problem, how would other people look at me? So even though they may know the answer, they may not feel free enough to act in their own best interest. The next question that we ask in our assessment of determining how to manage the stressful matter is, what level of attention is required? Red, orange, or yellow. Now, red alert is an emergency, that means that is something that requires immediate attention, right now, if you don’t do something specifically right now, things will drastically get worse. An orange situation means that this is something that requires heightened attention, but it might not be critical to move on it this very instant. Yellow basically means that we are always consciously aware of what’s going on. We are not blindly operating in our life, or blindly operating with our relationships, but we are consciously aware. Aren’t there some people that you know that always act like everything is an emergency, is a red alert? We have to do it right now. Well, when you relax and breathe, and you take the time to make the assessment about the situation that’s causing you some stressful thoughts or your client, what if you could help them see, well, you know, this is something that you may have some time to manage or work out. The third questions that you would ask yourself is this. The information that you are gathering, is it the absolute truth? Some people, as they are trying to find the answer, they are only looking for confirmation for what they already believe, as opposed to searching for truth. Are you searching for truth, or are you searching for confirmation? There was a recent earthquake in Haiti, and some of the people who were victims of the earthquake were concerned that everybody was not acting in their best interest. So, some food was delivered to them in massive quantities, and some saw the food, and they looked at the labeling on it. And read the labeling and believed that the meals that they were being given was outdated, and it was unhealthy, and it was going to cause them health problems. And they discouraged people from eating it and they threw a lot of it away. Only to find out that their information really wasn’t based on truth. One way of determining whether something is true is to verify from three separate sources, and be clear yourself, are you looking for truth, or are you looking for confirmation for what you already believe. The next area of assessment that’s good for us, is what is your score? Assessing what your score is, and I identify that as skills, consequences, options and resources. What skills do you have? In terms of managing the problem, do you have skills to manage it yourself? Or is it better if somebody else takes care of that? In terms of the consequences and looking at the options and resources that you have, what are the consequences of various options that you may put in place? And if you take your time to look at each one of those, it might help you better determine, what is the next move that needs to be made. And lastly, of course, what are the resources for making that necessary change? What is your score? Simply, by taking a careful assessment, you are in a little bit better position to decide exactly how you want to proceed forward, and what kind of plan you need to make. The next A in our triple A plan, is called the adjustment. Cuz, you know, everything is created twice, first mentally and then the physical manifestation of that. So, once we have determined what we have during our assessment, the next thing is the adjustment. Uh, Robert Green, in his book, The 33 Strategies of War, speaks about elevating above the battlefield. Sung Sew in his book, The Art of War, also makes reference to the same point. It’s about elevating yourself to a pinnacle so you can decide which matters need immediate attention and are unavoidable and which ones you can avoid. You know the expression, sometimes you can’t see the forest from the trees? Well, when you elevate above the battlefield, but maintain your balance, your able to see the forest and the trees. Your able to step back far enough to decide exactly what has to be done. And they call that being a strategist, as opposed to being a tactician. Have you run into some clients that’s always battling something, all the time, there is always this crisis and this matter, and this is causing him stress because they haven’t stepped back far enough just to see, this might be something I can avoid. The next area in our adjustment, is recognizing that we might have to walk away from certain situations. Everything really doesn’t require our active involvement. And maybe it would be better if we were not involved and maybe the situation would resolve itself. A dear friend of mine his name is Rod Gilfrey, he is an opera singer. And he had an operation on his throat. Doctor told him don’t speak at all. He said, if you speak for at least the next week, you can lose your voice permanently. So he couldn’t speak. I asking him in one of our conversations, I said well, what did you learn during that time? You know what he said? He said, I learned that things work out pretty well even when I am not giving my input. Things that he saw going on with his family, he said they managed things on their own. I simply had to step out of the way, I realized that sometimes being quiet, or not being involved can help things work smoothly. The next area of adjustment is this Steven Covey says, that there is power in the gap. He says, between something happening that could cause stressful thoughts, and out reaction to it, he says, there's a gap that exists in there. And he says, in that gap, that’s where our power lies. He identifies four different things that are inside of that gap and if you can recognize those things in your adjustment, you and your client can become even more powerful in managing situations that could possibly cause them stress. In that gap, one of the things is imagination. Being able to find creative ways to resolve an issue. How do you build your imagination? Children use it constantly, they are always using their imagination and creativity in doing things, but if you don’t practice that skill, do you know it will not be available to you? The next area that lasts inside of that gap is your conscious. The things that help you decide what's right and what's wrong. But what do you use to determine what's right and what's wrong? What determines your conscious? Because of a book that you might read or something that you watch on television or a radio program? Or, how do you decide if something is right or wrong? Cuz, that exists between something happening and your reaction to it. and the more you recognize this in your adjustment, the more powerful you'll become in being able to manage stressful thoughts when they arise. Self awareness, knowing clearly who you are, is a powerful piece that lies in that gap. And lastly, in that gap, your independent will. They say, the ten most powerful two letter words is, if it is to be, it is up to me. So, once we recognize that we have the power to make some very powerful decisions, and we recognize our independent will, we'll expand that gap, giving us greater power and more ability to successfully handle a situation that could be stressful for us. The last piece I am going to give you as a bonus piece. And it is this, when you have done everything you can, thinking about that situation that’s causing you stressful thoughts, when you've done everything, your client has done everything they could, remember there is always one more thing that you can do. I call it keeping your computer plugged in. You know when you are on the internet, and your working the computer and you hit the enter button, to search for information, and it searches the world wide web? Well obviously, when you unplug the computer, you can’t search that, can you? But you know, our greatest computer, the brain, works the exact same way? But, its used, not by a plug, but by our language. And when we use language like I can’t do this, and this can’t be done, there's no way to resolve certain things, it stops us from thinking. But as long as we say to ourselves, I know there is one more thing that I can do, there is another option that maybe I can consider, then your mind will continue searching for the answer. Let me show you how that works. Have you ever been in a conversation with someone, and you are trying to think of somebody's name? And you say, I know his name, I just can’t think of it. and later on that evening you may be at home or washing dishes, or something and then all of a sudden you say, Bob, his name is Bob, that. Well, you weren’t thinking about Bob that whole time, were you? No. but your mind continued searching the world wide web of everything you have seen, heard or experienced in your life, coming around, until it found the answer. That is a very powerful tool in being able to resolve situations that you have identified as stressful. That brings us to the last A. You remember what it was? Activation. There is a poem that I wrote many years ago, and a part of it says, there were no citied built or great battles fought by people just sharing the things they thought. Action is truly the ultimate goal, because only from this, can the story be told. So, no matter how much we relax and breathe, no matter how well we do our assessment, no matter how many adjustments we make mentally or physically, until we take action, it has no impact at all, does it? So, in terms of taking action there are basically two ways we can do it. We can take our time and do what I call, from the book a Japanese Strategy, the Kaisen way. One small step, that means a very gradual process towards creating that change. Now that’s extremely powerful for a couple of reasons, one, is because when you move to fast to make a drastic change in your life, and something is going on, sometimes that fear factors pops up. Yes, and when that fear factor pops up, it inhibits, sometimes it even paralyses our movement. But when you take small, very little steps towards your goal, you are able to sneak right past the fear factor. But the other side of this is what happens, is that you build momentum, and the more you find success doing small things to create change, it builds momentum and you are able to make major changes, but just like they say, uh, a walk or a, of a thousand miles, begins with the first step. You are able to make thousands of miles of changes in your life, by one small step at a time. And the last one, is obviously doing it expeditiously. Moving swiftly, there are some things that must be addressed that way, and done immediately. So, in recapping the information for you, we are talking about the power of the triple A plan. To make the assessment, to make the necessary adjustment, and then to activate a plan, putting a plan in action, that is going to be able to make the change that we are looking for, to create. And we said, all of this rests on the bed, the foundation of what? That’s exactly right, being able to relax, and breathe and center yourself. What I encourage you to do, out of all the things we talked about, look for just one element that you could hold on to. That you can embrace. One small piece of information, and the moment that you share that with someone else, it will become stronger in you. Thank you so much for listening, I look forward to the next opportunity. Thank you.

SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Mr. Gentry, thank you so much, that was a very powerful presentation. 

00:20:45
MARCUS GENTRY Thank you. 

00:20:45
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D I um, I supervise students uh, who are training to become counselors, marriage and family, in school, and um, clinical mental health. And, uh, I come from an approach where I very much say, you have to speak the language of your clients, what moves them, what connects with them, and I think um, from listening to your talk, that’s something that you are very good at. Is putting things in a language where they can get activated, where they can be motivated to follow up on some of the suggestions that you make. 

00:21:20
Marcus Gentry 

00:21:20
MARCUS GENTRY Yes, well that is very much my intention. Uh, I believe in respecting other people as well, and in respecting other people, what that means for me is realizing that they actually have the elements and the tools inside of them already to process things, put it in perspective, and proceed forward. And I like to think of being someone who inspires them, to um, be able to look in the mirror at themselves and see different things that they can do to create the change that they are looking for, that’s important to them. 

00:21:50
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Great, um, you’d be very similar to what in my field we call solution focused. Um therapists, or counselors, someone who believes you already have the strengths within you, and that our role is to help motivate them and define where their goals are, and kind of guide them there, but its, its within them. 

00:22:10
MARCUS GENTRY It is, it is. 

00:22:10
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Now, when I was listening to you, you said that um, it sounded if I was going to put it in counseling jargon, that you are really talking about, um, prevention, and you’re talking about making choices rather than being reactive. 

00:22:25
MARCUS GENTRY Definitely making choices is critical, um, it not always prevention, because there will be something that will come up that will be out of our set of expectations, that will sometimes throw people off, and create emotions that are very stressful for them. So, we can’t always avoid those kind of things, but I am talking about being prepared when those emotions come up, to successfully assess them and be able to manage them with some measure of clarity. 

00:23:00
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Well, in know you do um, you do presentations for the military. 

00:23:00
MARCUS GENTRY Yes. 

00:23:00
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D And, of course, you know, when you’re out in the field, you can’t, you can’t um, predict everything that will happen, but they do in the military, is they prepare them to deal with unpredictability. 

00:23:10
MARCUS GENTRY That’s right, that’s right. 

00:23:15
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D So, it sounds a little bit that that’s you’re your doing, there are some things that you can learn when you are not in the moment of stress, to help you when you are actually in that moment. Some skills that you can learn. 

00:23:20
MARCUS GENTRY That’s exactly correct, even the piece that I talked about, some people um, look over and that’s just being over to relax and breathe. Cuz we are in such a fast paced society. But, if you are able to tap into that element, that space that situation that allows you to relax, and breathe then when that crisis hits you, you might be thrown off track for just a few moments initially, but, if you can go to that place, it will allow you to be more effective. And uh, the part where I was talking about Steven Covey's um, a power that lies in the gap, again, recognizing how to use your imagination in non crises moments, so when a crises comes up, you are very skilled at being creative. You are skilled at using your imagination, cuz you just used it that morning in something else. And the same thing with your conscious, and self awareness, and getting to know who you are, and obviously your independent will. 

00:24:15
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Yeah, so those are ways that you can be prepared for the unexpected or prepared for stress- 

00:24:20
MARCUS GENTRY Yes. 

00:24:20
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:24:20
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D When it comes up. Uh, now you did talk about stress almost as something to deal with or avoid, but as someone who specializes in motivating people, do you think stress can be useful sometimes? 

00:24:30
Marcus Gentry 

00:24:30
MARCUS GENTRY Absolutely. It can be very powerful. Um, stress is used sometimes to narrow your focus, as a matter of fact, some people can’t work well, until they are at the deadline. If they have an assignment or test that has to be completed six months ahead, they seem to uh, procrastinate, and not do very much. But when they get the call, that they have to uh, have it in by that next day, it narrows their focus, they are able to zero in and do some very good things because of that. So, stress can have some positive benefits, as long as we are conscious about its working. Because it has some, some subconscious uh, um, effects as well. 

00:25:10
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D So, stress can be motivating, it can help us narrow focus, it’s when it maybe sneaks up on us, or when it becomes it can become overwhelming, and then it works against us, instead of for us. 

00:25:20
MARCUS GENTRY Yes. and I would say, even when we use stress to narrow our focus, and to accomplish more things, if we don’t create balance, even when its being beneficial, it can create some difficulties later on. So, anybody who is living constantly under a stressful environment, even though there is some benefits to it, it can have some negative effects later on. 

00:25:50
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D True. And you talked about, and I want to tie this back to um, what you kind of call your self, but in your presentation, you talked about being a strategist. 

00:25:55
MARCUS GENTRY Yes. 

00:25:55
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Um, and to me, that was when you were talking about making choices rather than just being reactive. Can you say a little bit more about what it means to be a strategist? 

00:26:05
MARCUS GENTRY Absolutely. Uh, being a strategist means more at looking at your long term goal of where you are ultimately trying to get to. Being real clear of what your destination is, and not being caught up in some of the smaller things along the way. Um, tacticians, as I was mentioning earlier, are people who aren’t long term focused, and are just looking at the short term. And there's always something immediate. There is a crisis that has to be dealt with immediately. But, being a strategist means stepping back a little bit and say, this is a situation that actually I don’t have to give immediate attention to. As a matter of fact, I can delegate this to someone else, or, it's not even my issue to resolve, its someone else's. So, I can operate as a strategist, step back and just decide which ones are avoidable, and which ones are unavoidable. 

00:26:55
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:26:55
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Ah, very good. Um, we only have a couple more minutes, but I want to ask you, since you call yourself a transition strategist, uh, what exactly does that mean, and how does it relate to what you were just defining as a strategist? 

00:27:05
MARCUS GENTRY Transition strategist means helping people look at the long term destination of where they are going as they are trying to manage their transitions in life. Whether that transition is from um, in terms of the military from um, pre-deployment to deployment, or whether it’s a person who is employed, and they are trying to transition into uh, a retired state, or unemployment. Uh, whether someone is transitioning from marriage to divorce, or divorce to marriage, or um, from different financial situations, maybe when the economy changed, uh, people had a lot of difficulty transitioning from one set of incomes to a different set. Uh, children being home, to being empty nesters and they are no longer at home. Um, all sorts of things, we are always trying to transition or we are always transitioning from one phase of life to another. As we go from being teenagers, to young adults, from being young adults, to older ones. To being older ones to senior citizens. There's transitions that’s happening in our lives, and we need to develop if we are going to enjoy our journey in our seasons, develop strategies for being able to do that. And that is where I specialize in. Trying to help people determine what strategies are going to work for them in terms of their long term goal. 

00:28:30
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Good. And it’s interesting because it relates to what you were talking about, that transitions, even the happy ones can be a time of a lot of stress. 

00:28:35
MARCUS GENTRY Sure can. 

00:28:35
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D You know going to, marriage, having kids, um, leaving school, those are happy things, but they also have a lot of unpredictability in them, and therefore usually have a lot of stress for people. Um, and I do want to say that sometimes a transition can be a crisis, if we are not aware of the stress that’s involved. 

00:28:55
MARCUS GENTRY Absolutely, absolutely, it can. One of the things. 

00:29:00
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Oh, sorry we don’t have time- 

00:29:00
MARCUS GENTRY That’s fine. 

00:29:00
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D I would love for you to go on about it but I have to, I'm sorry I have to wrap up. 

00:29:05
MARCUS GENTRY No worries. 

00:29:05
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D But, if you want to hear more about what Mr. Gentry um, has to say, please visit the Alexander Street Press website for more of Mr. Gentry, and some of our other speakers.
