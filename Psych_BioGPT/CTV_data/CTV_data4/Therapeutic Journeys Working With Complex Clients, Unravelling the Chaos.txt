00:00:35
JOANNA SKEWES Um, I don-, I don-, I don't know where to start. 

00:00:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. There's a lot there, hmm? 

00:00:45
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:00:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, yeah. Okay. It's really important that you've come in and, to, to see someone if you're in this kind of state, cuz this is not ok to carry this all by yourself, is it? Hmm? No. 

00:01:00
JOANNA SKEWES Sorry. 

00:01:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Why? I, I, I think it's for you to feel sorry for yourself, that you're carrying as much, hmm? And it's for us to spend the next hour together, this part of the hour, to go through what it is that's piling up for you, yeah? And, um, to try and help you get some sense of order about where to start, hmm? Because there will be a place that we can start together, hmm? 

00:01:25
JOANNA SKEWES Sorry 

00:01:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah 

00:01:30
JOANNA SKEWES Just feel like an idiot 

00:01:30
SANDY WILLIAMS You feel like an idiot? You feel like an idiot for what? 

00:01:35
JOANNA SKEWES Things I'm missing. 

00:01:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. 

00:01:40
JOANNA SKEWES I just, uh... 

00:01:40
SANDY WILLIAMS No. You think you could've stopped it, hmm? Well, maybe that's, that's for us to do. To look at, together, at what are the things that you do have some control over, and what are the things that have been thrust upon you that you have less control over. Hmm? Does that sound like an okay way for us to go? 

00:01:55
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah. 

00:02:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. So, wh-, where would you like to start?Wh-, what's, you know... 

00:02:05
[sil.] 

00:02:05
JOANNA SKEWES Um, uh, my other half walked out two weeks ago. That's when I called... 

00:02:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:02:15
JOANNA SKEWES ...for an appointment and it's just, uh, everything's just falling in a heap. 

00:02:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:02:20
JOANNA SKEWES Was falling in a heap before he left, and... 

00:02:25
[sil.] 

00:02:25
JOANNA SKEWES ...I feel kinda sick. 

00:02:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Yeah. 

00:02:30
[sil.] 

00:02:30
JOANNA SKEWES And the kids are, uh, it's just too much. I've got two, two kids and they... 

00:02:40
[sil.] 

00:02:40
JOANNA SKEWES ...I just get up in the morning and I just start... 

00:02:45
SANDY WILLIAMS You don't know where to start, yeah. 

00:02:45
JOANNA SKEWES ...but, the young one's just crying and the other one wants my attention, and I am just, I just can't think straight anymore, and... 

00:02:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So the last two weeks have been particularly bad? Hmm? 

00:03:05
JOANNA SKEWES Honestly, yeah. I, I've come such a long way, and, and it's just... 

00:03:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:03:10
JOANNA SKEWES ...gone down the toilet again. 

00:03:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Oh, okay. 

00:03:15
JOANNA SKEWES Eh 

00:03:15
SANDY WILLIAMS And so, you've, you've come a long way, you're gonna need to... 

00:03:15
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:03:15
SANDY WILLIAMS ...to tell me about that at some point... 

00:03:20
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:03:20
SANDY WILLIAMS ...but so, so your partner, your husband... 

00:03:20
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah, uh, just, um, partner. 

00:03:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Partner? Yeah, and you'd been with him for? 

00:03:25
JOANNA SKEWES Gosh, nearly 10 years? 

00:03:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So he's, he's the father of your two kids. 

00:03:30
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah. 

00:03:30
SANDY WILLIAMS And, and your kids are? 

00:03:35
JOANNA SKEWES Um, 1? 

00:03:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:03:35
JOANNA SKEWES Sophie. 

00:03:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Yes? 

00:03:35
JOANNA SKEWES And John is 4. 

00:03:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. That's quite a hand full, aye? Yeah. 

00:03:45
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:03:45
SANDY WILLIAMS And your, your partner's name? 

00:03:45
JOANNA SKEWES Adam 

00:03:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Adam? Okay. 

00:03:45
JOANNA SKEWES Was Adam. 

00:03:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Was Adam.

00:03:55
Exploring the Presenting Problem drug use 

00:03:55
SANDY WILLIAMS So, he left two weeks ago? 

00:04:05
JOANNA SKEWES Uh-huh 

00:04:05
SANDY WILLIAMS And you said there'd been difficulty up to that point, anyway, and obviously, people don't separate without there having been... 

00:04:10
JOANNA SKEWES Out of the blue? 

00:04:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:04:15
JOANNA SKEWES No. We, um, sort of, drugs had come up again... 

00:04:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay 

00:04:20
JOANNA SKEWES ...and, um, I'd been on methadone for two years, and um... 

00:04:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm-hmm? 

00:04:25
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah, I'd done so well, but he just got back into the drugs again, and... 

00:04:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:04:30
JOANNA SKEWES ...uh, I just got sucked in again, then. And, the same old thing happened, like, the bills aren't paid... 

00:04:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:04:45
JOANNA SKEWES ...and, uh, just everything's falling in. 

00:04:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So, you said that you got sucked back in again, that you, you started to use a bit again w-, with him? 

00:05:00
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah. 

00:05:00
SANDY WILLIAMS It's very difficult, isn't it, in a partnership, um, to hold a firm line, which is, you know... 

00:05:05
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:05:05
SANDY WILLIAMS ...kind of separates you from your partner, in a sense. So, I imagine... 

00:05:10
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:05:10
SANDY WILLIAMS ...that was a big challenge for you, and if you'd been together for 10 years, you've got quite a history. You've got two children. 

00:05:15
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:05:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm? 

00:05:15
JOANNA SKEWES And now, he's just walked out on me... 

00:05:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:05:20
JOANNA SKEWES ...and left me with, all of it. 

00:05:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:05:25
JOANNA SKEWES I... 

00:05:30
[sil.] 

00:05:30
SANDY WILLIAMS So, that's, that's been a huge issue for you and you're saying that, sort of, managing the kids on your own has been a huge challenge for you... 

00:05:40
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:05:40
SANDY WILLIAMS ...you're still on the methadone program? 

00:05:40
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:05:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah? 

00:05:40
JOANNA SKEWES I've been doing, um, a reduction. 

00:05:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:05:45
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:05:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Have you? 

00:05:45
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:05:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Well, when you say you've been doing well, that does sound like you've been doing really well. So you hit a bit of a bump, and when Adam... 

00:05:50
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:05:55
SANDY WILLIAMS ...was, did Adam ever stop? Or, or... 

00:05:55
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah, he stopped. 

00:05:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Was he on the program as well? 

00:06:00
JOANNA SKEWES No. 

00:06:00
SANDY WILLIAMS He was not. 

00:06:00
JOANNA SKEWES No 

00:06:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:06:00
JOANNA SKEWES We're both, we both sort of stopped using heroin a couple of years ago, and I got on the 'done, and, um, yeah, he sort of just stopped, and I just wasn't doing so well, so I started on the 'done... 

00:06:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay 

00:06:10
JOANNA SKEWES ...and then just sort of been cutting that back, but, you know, I've been doing all right with the heroin. Just a couple of recent uses... 

00:06:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay 

00:06:20
JOANNA SKEWES ...that was the problem, was getting back into that (inaudible). 

00:06:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:06:20
JOANNA SKEWES The speed's been more of an issue, really. I just, um, now. 

00:06:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay, so, you've been using a bit of, a bit of speed. 

00:06:30
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah. I just, I don't like, like the idea, but I'm just, um... 

00:06:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm 

00:06:35
JOANNA SKEWES I just can't handle everything, like, I'm always, so tired, and... 

00:06:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Yes 

00:06:45
JOANNA SKEWES ...I just... 

00:06:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, and it is a... 

00:06:45
JOANNA SKEWES I don't 

00:06:45
SANDY WILLIAMS ...it is a drug which gives ya a, a bit of energy in the short term, isn't it? 

00:06:50
JOANNA SKEWES Yes 

00:06:50
SANDY WILLIAMS So, that's kind of understandable that you've been drawn into that. Was, was that a drug used before, or is it one that you've been leaning on a bit more recently? 

00:07:00
JOANNA SKEWES No, I, probably more recently. 

00:07:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:07:00
JOANNA SKEWES Like, um, I think, I didn't wanna go back to (inaudible), so... 

00:07:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:07:10
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah, and I don't know. It's not so much been around anymore... 

00:07:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm-hmm 

00:07:10
JOANNA SKEWES ...and it's sort of this speed thing coming up... 

00:07:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:07:15
JOANNA SKEWES ...and... 

00:07:20
[music] 

00:07:20
Looking at the Broader Picture 

00:07:20
SANDY WILLIAMS And, w-, what else is, is going on in your life?You said there's just so many things, it's been a big pile-up of things. I mean, they're big enough issues, but... 

00:07:35
JOANNA SKEWES True 

00:07:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Maybe, if I can, you know, if we can set out everything that's, that's troubling you at the moment, we can then kind of look at the territory together, and work out, maybe, where the, the best place to start is. 

00:07:45
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah. I don't know. It's just, it's just all about the bills and... 

00:07:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay 

00:07:50
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah. I'm just starting to get worried about paying, about paying the rent, and, um, yeah, our money's sort of gone on the drugs, and it's not that I've been using heaps, It's just been enough, it's just been enough to get me through... 

00:08:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Uh-huh 

00:08:05
JOANNA SKEWES ...but, um it's the in between him, sort of, walking out and the kids are just, every time they, sort of, I don't know, probably just the noise is getting to me, and I just, uh, it's just like, I get to the point where I feel like I just can't take anymore, and my head feels like it's about to just, spin off. 

00:08:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. 

00:08:30
JOANNA SKEWES And, it's like, I'm gonna go, crazy or something... 

00:08:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay, yeah. 

00:08:35
JOANNA SKEWES ...I just... 

00:08:40
[sil.] 

00:08:40
SANDY WILLIAMS It's, it's difficult for you to kind of, keep cool enough to keep the wheels turning over, as far as the household's going? 

00:08:50
JOANNA SKEWES Yes. I've just, there's just a thousand things to do, and, I just seem to start one thing, and then, do another thing, and do another thing, and then, I've just got everything going on in my head at once, and, you know, then family turns up, and, uh... 

00:09:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Your, your family? 

00:09:10
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah, and they may turn up and I'm just trying to cover, you know, and... 

00:09:15
SANDY WILLIAMS You're trying to cover? 

00:09:15
JOANNA SKEWES I don't know, that, that it's all falling apart, like... 

00:09:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:09:20
JOANNA SKEWES I don't want them to know what's going on, and I'll just, cuz I just, uh, they've been through it so many times before... 

00:09:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm. 

00:09:30
JOANNA SKEWES ...I'm just worried they're just gonna walk out the door on me. 

00:09:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So, when you say family, is it like, what, your parents, your mother, or... 

00:09:40
JOANNA SKEWES Mum 

00:09:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Your mum? 

00:09:40
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah. 

00:09:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah? 

00:09:40
JOANNA SKEWES Dad 

00:09:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:09:40
JOANNA SKEWES Mum's all right, yeah. 

00:09:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:09:45
JOANNA SKEWES I just, ah, I just can't bear it alone again, again with a... 

00:09:50
SANDY WILLIAMS I wonder whether they might, they might actually see that, that Adam leaving a couple of weeks ago, is probably going to throw anyone, you know, anyone's husband, any partner, leaving, is going to throw things into a bit of disarray. 

00:10:00
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:10:00
SANDY WILLIAMS It sounds to me like you might be trying to do this alone a bit, when maybe... 

00:10:05
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:10:05
SANDY WILLIAMS ...if your folks are on side, and you have been doing pretty well, um... 

00:10:10
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:10:10
SANDY WILLIAMS ...in the past, and they know about that. They know you're on, on the program? 

00:10:10
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah, but they don't know about the recent drug use, like, um, I just... 

00:10:20
[sil.] 

00:10:20
JOANNA SKEWES ...I just feel like such a dickhead cuz I've just , uh, they've seen me go through it time and time again. 

00:10:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Yes 

00:10:25
JOANNA SKEWES I feel like, that if I have to tell them... 

00:10:30
SANDY WILLIAMS There's been... 

00:10:30
JOANNA SKEWES ...time and time again, I just think, you know. 

00:10:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. So, you're kind of concerned there'll be a, a point at which they'll just say it's too much? Hmm... 

00:10:40
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:10:40
SANDY WILLIAMS ...and yet, the evidence is, they've kind of been there... 

00:10:40
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:10:40
SANDY WILLIAMS ...with you all through, haven't they? 

00:10:45
JOANNA SKEWES That's true. 

00:10:45
SANDY WILLIAMS And I imagine that... 

00:10:45
JOANNA SKEWES That's true 

00:10:45
SANDY WILLIAMS ...that, you know, they would be sympathetic to the fact... 

00:10:45
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:10:45
SANDY WILLIAMS ...that your partner's actually gone, and now that you've got two little (inaudible) that are a real handful. 

00:10:50
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:10:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah? 

00:10:55
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:10:55
SANDY WILLIAMS I mean, the proof's in the pudding, they're, they've kind of hung in with you. Mmm? 

00:10:55
JOANNA SKEWES That's true. 

00:10:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah 

00:11:00
[music] 

00:11:00
Assessing the Risks 

00:11:10
SANDY WILLIAMS You, you said that you feel like your head's gonna burst... 

00:11:10
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:11:10
SANDY WILLIAMS ...off, at times. Um, a 1-year-old and a 4-year-old can tax anybody's patience, you know? 

00:11:15
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:11:15
SANDY WILLIAMS And tell me a little bit more about how you're managing with the kids. 

00:11:20
JOANNA SKEWES I sort of feel like I'm not managing, like... 

00:11:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm-hmm 

00:11:25
JOANNA SKEWES ...I know I, even with Adam there... 

00:11:30
[sil.] 

00:11:30
JOANNA SKEWES I felt like I was doing it by myself, anyway. 

00:11:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:11:35
JOANNA SKEWES Uh, and I just don't know if I'm doing the right thing, and, uh, I'm scared about what, uh... 

00:11:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm-hmm 

00:11:45
JOANNA SKEWES ...how, what, what I'm doing is, uh, with them... 

00:11:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:11:45
JOANNA SKEWES ...what's been going on in my life, and how it's affecting them, cuz I just, I lose my temper so quickly now days that... 

00:11:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Which is understandable. 

00:11:55
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:11:55
SANDY WILLIAMS You must have a pretty short fuse, given the pressure you're under. 

00:12:00
JOANNA SKEWES I just don't, uh, I just really worry, given everything that's , sort of, gone on... 

00:12:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm-hmm 

00:12:05
JOANNA SKEWES ...with Adam and I, and what's been going on, that, uh, that it's, they're gonna get damaged. 

00:12:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:12:10
JOANNA SKEWES And it... 

00:12:15
SANDY WILLIAMS So, you care about your kids, deeply 

00:12:15
JOANNA SKEWES ...and. Yeah. 

00:12:15
SANDY WILLIAMS You care about... 

00:12:15
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:12:15
SANDY WILLIAMS ...them very much. 

00:12:20
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah, yeah. I just, yeah. 

00:12:20
SANDY WILLIAMS It sounds, to me, like, you, you're concerned about the impact of everything on them, and whether they are gonna be okay. Yeah? And... 

00:12:30
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:12:30
SANDY WILLIAMS You say that you, you know, understandably, can lose your temper. Mmm? Do you feel, at any point, that you might harm them? You know, when you're kinda not in your right mind, is that a worry... 

00:12:40
JOANNA SKEWES Nah... 

00:12:40
SANDY WILLIAMS ...for you? 

00:12:40
JOANNA SKEWES ...I just, um, it's, uh, look, um, I'm not the sort of person to harm my kids? 

00:12:50
SANDY WILLIAMS No 

00:12:50
JOANNA SKEWES Um... 

00:12:50
SANDY WILLIAMS No, no. I don't have a sense of that either, but I do know that... 

00:12:55
JOANNA SKEWES I just... 

00:12:55
SANDY WILLIAMS ...you're being pushed to the limit... 

00:12:55
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:12:55
SANDY WILLIAMS ...at the moment, and I wonder if, you know, that's one of the things we can do together. 

00:13:00
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm? 

00:13:00
SANDY WILLIAMS You know, not rush into it, but, you know, when we set it all out and look at where to go. One of the things we could do together, might be, like, when your kids are being 1 and 4-year olds, which can drive anyone crackers at times, that there are some things you can do, when you reach (inaudible), that... 

00:13:15
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:13:15
SANDY WILLIAMS ...you know, would tolerate more. There are some simple things that maybe we can talk about doing that will help you, kind of, just... 

00:13:20
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:13:20
SANDY WILLIAMS ...get a little bit of breathing space. 

00:13:25
JOANNA SKEWES Okay 

00:13:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm? Yeah. 

00:13:25
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:13:25
SANDY WILLIAMS But I sense that you care for your kids deeply, and um... 

00:13:30
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah, yeah. 

00:13:35
[music] 

00:13:35
Offering the Client a Positive Perspective 

00:13:35
JOANNA SKEWES I get a bit worried about being here, cuz, um... 

00:13:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm-hmm? 

00:13:45
JOANNA SKEWES ...um, the Department's been involved before... 

00:13:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:13:50
JOANNA SKEWES ...and, they, um... 

00:14:00
[sil.] 

00:14:00
JOANNA SKEWES I'm worried that someone'll say I'm not a good parent and that... 

00:14:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, right. 

00:14:05
JOANNA SKEWES ...the kids shouldn't be with me. 

00:14:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:14:10
JOANNA SKEWES Um 

00:14:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay, so, there's some bumps in the past that, that had the Department involved. 

00:14:15
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:14:15
SANDY WILLIAMS And, how long ago was that? 

00:14:20
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm, I think, three years ago? 

00:14:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Years ago? That was before you were on the program, and before you'd made lots of the progress that you're talking to me about. 

00:14:30
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah, I just, um... 

00:14:30
SANDY WILLIAMS And here you are, sitting here... 

00:14:30
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:14:30
SANDY WILLIAMS ...well before anything has happened that's... 

00:14:35
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:14:35
SANDY WILLIAMS ...serious, as far as I can gather, so, I would see you coming here is a very constructive step, in the context of you having made a lot of significant changes in your life. 

00:14:45
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:14:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm? So... 

00:14:45
JOANNA SKEWES I just don't see... 

00:14:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm? 

00:14:45
JOANNA SKEWES ...them as big changes, like... 

00:14:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:14:50
JOANNA SKEWES I should've don-, I could've done better than they said. I just, uh, it worries me that, when the Department was involved before, they sort of, I mean they basically said, if I used drugs again, it's, it's bad news, and... 

00:15:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:15:10
JOANNA SKEWES ...um... 

00:15:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. What... 

00:15:10
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:15:10
SANDY WILLIAMS ...I'm understanding, though, is, that this has been quite recent... 

00:15:15
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:15:15
SANDY WILLIAMS ...hasn't it? You know, and you've... 

00:15:15
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:15:15
SANDY WILLIAMS ...you've kind of woken up pretty quickly to, to... 

00:15:15
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:15:20
SANDY WILLIAMS ...the fact that you were getting into territory that wasn't, okay... 

00:15:20
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:15:20
SANDY WILLIAMS ...and I imagine that was part of the blow-up with Adam, is that right? 

00:15:25
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah, it was... 

00:15:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Part of it? 

00:15:25
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah, it was more like blowing up with him, I guess. 

00:15:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Yes, yeah. 

00:15:30
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:15:30
SANDY WILLIAMS But you know, that you were worried... 

00:15:30
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:15:30
SANDY WILLIAMS ...that something had happened, started to happen again, in your life, that you didn't want to happen. 

00:15:35
JOANNA SKEWES Well, that was before I cleaned up. 

00:15:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm? 

00:15:40
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah, when he kept using, and, like, he was going a lot harder, and I was, like... 

00:15:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:15:45
JOANNA SKEWES ...I am worried that, that means... 

00:15:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah 

00:15:45
JOANNA SKEWES ...you know, that we'll end up where we were before, with... 

00:15:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah 

00:15:50
JOANNA SKEWES ...the Department... 

00:15:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, so I say the fact that, actually, your separation has been brought about by you being very concerned about what was happening with drugs in your life... 

00:15:55
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:15:55
SANDY WILLIAMS ...is actually a pretty constructive way that the department could see it. You know, here you are... 

00:16:00
JOANNA SKEWES Okay 

00:16:00
SANDY WILLIAMS ...you've come for help because things came to a head, pretty quickly, and you, kind of, said "No. I don't wanna be here. I don't want this happening again." Mmm? 

00:16:10
JOANNA SKEWES Oh, okay 

00:16:10
SANDY WILLIAMS So, I, you know, I think there's a, there's a take on this, that the Department, perhaps, with, you know, reports from, from us, you know, might be helpful, if it came to that. 

00:16:20
JOANNA SKEWES Okay. 

00:16:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah? If, do you see how I'm looking at it? 

00:16:20
JOANNA SKEWES Okay 

00:16:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:16:25
JOANNA SKEWES I guess I, yeah, haven't thought about it that way. I just, um... 

00:16:25
SANDY WILLIAMS You've taken pretty constructive action. 

00:16:30
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah? 

00:16:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah 

00:16:30
JOANNA SKEWES Nah. I just feel like I should've, just not started again, and, uh... 

00:16:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm 

00:16:35
JOANNA SKEWES ...I just feel so guilty that how could I, you know, uh, it just feels all, yeah, it just feels all bad to me. 

00:16:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. You've been in this game long enough to know, that relapses are, is an old, old enemy lurking... 

00:16:50
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:16:50
SANDY WILLIAMS ...in the wings, isn't it? It can pounce... 

00:16:50
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah, (inaudible) 

00:16:50
SANDY WILLIAMS ...just when you think you're cruising along, doing fine. Mmm? 

00:16:55
JOANNA SKEWES I'd just about done that.

SANDY WILLIAMS I wonder if you could tell me a little bit more about the, sort of, lead up to Adam leaving? 

00:17:10
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:17:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Cuz that's.... 

00:17:10
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm? 

00:17:15
SANDY WILLIAMS ...a pretty big thing. Mmm? What, what else was going on? 

00:17:15
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm. I guess things have been, um, building up over time, really, like, there's always been some tensions in the relationship, and, um, sometimes, he just doesn't understand where I'm coming from, and, um, yeah, just the drug use and then, with all of that, it just, we sort went downhill, though. 

00:17:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm-hmm? 

00:17:40
JOANNA SKEWES He, um... 

00:17:40
SANDY WILLIAMS You mean, there were sort of difficulties before, and then the drug use... 

00:17:45
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:17:45
SANDY WILLIAMS ...kind of escalated, and things went... 

00:17:45
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:17:45
SANDY WILLIAMS ...really downhill. 

00:17:50
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah. 

00:17:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm 

00:17:50
JOANNA SKEWES Sort of, um, sometimes I just, I don't know, but there's a lot of things, I think, going on, with the finances and stuff, and... 

00:17:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm-hmm? 

00:18:00
JOANNA SKEWES ...he just doesn't understand, uh, some parts of me, like... 

00:18:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm-hmm? 

00:18:05
JOANNA SKEWES ...um... 

00:18:10
[sil.] 

00:18:10
JOANNA SKEWES ...he, he wants to just get, sort of, close to me, and... 

00:18:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:18:15
JOANNA SKEWES ...and, I, yeah. I just, sometimes he doesn't understand that I'm not after that? 

00:18:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Uh-huh 

00:18:20
JOANNA SKEWES Um 

00:18:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. It's a funny thing, isn't it, that, I think, it's not uncommon for men to want physical closeness... 

00:18:25
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:18:30
SANDY WILLIAMS ...with their partner, when things go wobbly. 

00:18:30
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:18:30
SANDY WILLIAMS It's kind of like they want reassurance... 

00:18:30
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:18:30
SANDY WILLIAMS ...that they're still wanted and things are still okay, on that, kind of, base level. 

00:18:35
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:18:35
SANDY WILLIAMS But, for women, it's actually quite difficult for closeness to occur when the context is pretty awful. 

00:18:40
JOANNA SKEWES (inaudible) exactly... 

00:18:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm? Yeah 

00:18:40
JOANNA SKEWES We're either completely pissed off with him... 

00:18:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah 

00:18:45
JOANNA SKEWES ...the last thing I want is sex. 

00:18:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Yes 

00:18:45
JOANNA SKEWES I mean... 

00:18:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Yeah? 

00:18:50
JOANNA SKEWES Really. 

00:18:50
SANDY WILLIAMS And yet, he's probably seeing it as... 

00:18:50
JOANNA SKEWES Uh-huh 

00:18:55
SANDY WILLIAMS ...as kind of a way to still feel connected, and maybe, is kinda comfort, but that doesn't mean that you need to oblige. Hmm? 

00:19:00
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:19:00
SANDY WILLIAMS It's important that you feel okay... 

00:19:00
JOANNA SKEWES It, sort of, doesn't... 

00:19:00
SANDY WILLIAMS ...about... 

00:19:00
JOANNA SKEWES ...it doesn't, he doesn't, he doesn't understand that I like this, and stuff that's happened to me, but, he, he just doesn't get it, and he... 

00:19:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:19:10
JOANNA SKEWES ...he just, sort of, does stuff, that, um.... 

00:19:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay 

00:19:15
JOANNA SKEWES ...that reminds me of stuff that happened. 

00:19:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay 

00:19:15
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah. 

00:19:20
SANDY WILLIAMS So you've had... 

00:19:20
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:19:20
SANDY WILLIAMS ...had some experiences that have been... 

00:19:20
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:19:20
SANDY WILLIAMS ...pretty, pretty awful in the past. 

00:19:25
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:19:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah 

00:19:25
JOANNA SKEWES I've talked to a couple of other people about it, so... 

00:19:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay 

00:19:30
JOANNA SKEWES ...yeah 

00:19:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. What? When, when you were very young, or... 

00:19:30
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:19:30
SANDY WILLIAMS ...or older? Right. 

00:19:30
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah. It's just, one of the family members. 

00:19:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay 

00:19:35
JOANNA SKEWES (Inaudible) so... 

00:19:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Sorry to hear that. 

00:19:35
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:19:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah 

00:19:40
JOANNA SKEWES So am I. 

00:19:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Yes, of course. 

00:19:40
JOANNA SKEWES Anyway, I don't know. Yeah 

00:19:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Does it have reverbrations, in terms of your relationship with, with Adam? 

00:19:45
JOANNA SKEWES Uh-huh 

00:19:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah? 

00:19:45
JOANNA SKEWES It just keeps coming up. 

00:19:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm 

00:19:50
JOANNA SKEWES I don't know. I don't know if I even want to talk about it, like... 

00:19:50
SANDY WILLIAMS No... 

00:19:50
JOANNA SKEWES ...it's just a bit... 

00:19:50
SANDY WILLIAMS ...I'll bet it's, I guess, you know, when you kin-, when you said to me, this 'whole bunch of stuff,' you know, it's kind of, like, you have got a lot on your plate, haven't you? 

00:20:00
JOANNA SKEWES Yep 

00:20:00
SANDY WILLIAMS There are some old, historical things, which are still having an impact in the here-and-now, and there's some rec-, more recent things that have happened. 

00:20:05
JOANNA SKEWES I know 

00:20:10
[sil.] 

00:20:10
SANDY WILLIAMS And all the shit hits the fan, and I end up with, end up with this different stuff that's happening now, the last thing I want to be doing is visit the shit that happened before, and, now, so, I end up with, walking around the house during the day, and I've got all this stuff going on. I've got the kids going crazy, I've got bills coming in that I can't pay. The old bills that are coming in... 

00:20:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Yeah. 

00:20:30
JOANNA SKEWES ...him walking out the door, on top of these, all, all the other stuff that's happened in the past, decides to... 

00:20:35

00:20:55
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I just, just like I, I just, I don't know, go through by it, sometimes I just don't feel like I can keep doing this? And it... 

00:21:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. It just feels too hard. Yeah. 

00:21:10
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm, mmm 

00:21:10
SANDY WILLIAMS D-, do you ever feel that it's so hard that you just don't want to be here anymore? 

00:21:15
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:21:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:21:20
[sil.] 

00:21:20
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah. Yeah. 

00:21:25
SANDY WILLIAMS And have you ever actually thought about doing something that would mean that you weren't here anymore? 

00:21:30
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm. Uh, I've thought about it, but I, I think it would be 

00:21:35
[sil.] 

00:21:35
JOANNA SKEWES ...a leap, to actually do it. 

00:21:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Yeah. 

00:21:40
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah, it's, um, it's just, uh, I know it's just that, some mornings, I just wake up, and I'd be quite happy if I didn't. 

00:21:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah 

00:21:50
JOANNA SKEWES You know? 

00:21:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Of course. 

00:21:50
JOANNA SKEWES That's all. 

00:21:50
SANDY WILLIAMS And, I think that that's perfectly understandable, that you would just, sometimes, imagine that if you weren't around anymore, what, all of this shit wouldn't be around. Hmm? 

00:22:00
JOANNA SKEWES Exactly 

00:22:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah 

00:22:00
JOANNA SKEWES That's all I want, just for it all, I just want a break from it all, though. 

00:22:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Yes. It's been pretty relentless, hasn't it? 

00:22:05
JOANNA SKEWES Just an hour, like... 

00:22:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah 

00:22:10
JOANNA SKEWES ...to myself, without... 

00:22:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Yes, yeah. 

00:22:10
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:22:15
SANDY WILLIAMS What keeps you going? Cuz you're still here, you're sitting on the seat, talking to me... 

00:22:15
JOANNA SKEWES I don't know 

00:22:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm? 

00:22:20
JOANNA SKEWES I don't know. 

00:22:20
SANDY WILLIAMS How come you haven't succumbed to these rather idle thoughts, and... 

00:22:25
[sil.] 

00:22:25
JOANNA SKEWES I don't know. The kids? 

00:22:25
SANDY WILLIAMS The kids? 

00:22:25
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:22:30
SANDY WILLIAMS They mean a lot to you, don't they? Mmm? 

00:22:30
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:22:30
SANDY WILLIAMS So 

00:22:30
JOANNA SKEWES I think, without them, I'd pretty stuffed. 

00:22:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:22:35
JOANNA SKEWES It's stuffed anyway, but, yeah... 

00:22:40
SANDY WILLIAMS So, Sophie and John are really important, little, little creatures in your life, you know, and they would certainly, um... 

00:22:45
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:22:45
SANDY WILLIAMS ...suffer terribly, if you were not in their lives. 

00:22:45
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah. 

00:22:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm? 

00:22:50
JOANNA SKEWES And, I think, you know, in some ways, they drive me crazy, it's probably the thing that keeps me in there.

SANDY WILLIAMS I think another thing that we need to look at, together, is how you can find the odd hour for yourself, so, that you can have some respite from some of this, cuz it's not okay... 

00:23:15
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:23:15
SANDY WILLIAMS ...for you to be, you know, relentlessly on tap, and feeling like your head's gonna burst, and you just can't do it. You know, one pair of hands, to manage all of this. Hmm? 

00:23:25
JOANNA SKEWES But people do it? Like, I, I look around, and, you know, other parents are doing it. 

00:23:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm-hmm 

00:23:30
JOANNA SKEWES So... 

00:23:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:23:35
JOANNA SKEWES ...why can't I, you know? 

00:23:35
SANDY WILLIAMS So, you've got a, a bit of a, a standard in here, that says, you know, I should be able to, to do this in a certain way, otherwise I'm... 

00:23:40
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:23:45
SANDY WILLIAMS ...I'm not an okay mum, or... 

00:23:45
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:23:45
SANDY WILLIAMS ...I'm not an okay partner, or daughter, or wh-, whatever. Yeah? 

00:23:50
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:23:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Where does, where does that come from? Where does, you know? Who's, who's kinda... 

00:23:55
JOANNA SKEWES I don't know 

00:23:55
SANDY WILLIAMS ...holding the whip over you, there? 

00:23:55
JOANNA SKEWES I've, uh, been stuffing up for so many years, like, have to make up time. 

00:24:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:24:05
JOANNA SKEWES You know? I just, um... 

00:24:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Why do you say you've been 'stuffing up' for so many years? It's kind of like, when you say it like that, it's like you set out to, you know, to do these things. Mmm? I don't imagine for a moment that you woke up each day, thinking "What can I do to stuff up, today?" Hmm? 

00:24:25
JOANNA SKEWES No. 

00:24:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah 

00:24:25
JOANNA SKEWES I guess not. 

00:24:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, yeah. I mean, my, my sense is, that, you know, you've been kinda trying to do what you can... 

00:24:30
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:24:30
SANDY WILLIAMS ...um, so far, on your journey, and it has been less than ideal, in terms of, of some of the consequences for you, but they haven't intentionally set out to stuff up. Hmm? 

00:24:50
JOANNA SKEWES I just, I just, yeah, I feel I, yeah, just, yeah. 

00:24:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm 

00:24:55
JOANNA SKEWES What you're saying makes sense, it just... 

00:24:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:24:55
JOANNA SKEWES ...it's looks bad. 

00:25:00
SANDY WILLIAMS It looks bad to? 

00:25:00
JOANNA SKEWES Me 

00:25:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. I think you've hit the nail on the head... 

00:25:00
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:25:05
SANDY WILLIAMS ...because I think unless you can, kind of, turn things around and be how you view yourself, you know, that you could be a bit more of a compassionate ally in this process. Hmm? 

00:25:10
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:25:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Um, then you are gonna be prey to wondering what other people think of you. Mmm? 

00:25:15
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:25:15
SANDY WILLIAMS But your folks have hung in with you? 

00:25:20
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:25:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:25:20
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:25:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Your kids are attached to you, I imagine. Yeah? 

00:25:25
JOANNA SKEWES Sometimes, too much. 

00:25:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah? 

00:25:25
JOANNA SKEWES Yep 

00:25:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Do you, do you have any friends, Jo? 

00:25:30
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah. It's been hard, I haven't, I've got a couple of, I guess, longer-term friends that have stuck in with me, but, um, for the, I lost a lot of them, lot of other friends on the way, and... 

00:25:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm 

00:25:45
JOANNA SKEWES ...since I, sort of, started on the 'done, it's been trying to just keep my distance... 

00:25:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah 

00:25:45
JOANNA SKEWES ...from anyone that's using. 

00:25:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay 

00:25:50
JOANNA SKEWES so, it's... 

00:25:50
SANDY WILLIAMS That's a really wise thing to be doing, but at, you're kind of, damned if you do, and damned if you don't, aren't you? Because if you gravitate towards them, you kind of get caught in that old slipstream. If you hold back from them... 

00:26:00
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:26:05
SANDY WILLIAMS ...then, in some ways, you, you'd, it's a bit lonelier. Mmm-hmm? 

00:26:10
JOANNA SKEWES Sort of, um, I just don't feel, normal? 

00:26:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:26:10
JOANNA SKEWES I'm trying to be normal... 

00:26:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah 

00:26:15
JOANNA SKEWES ... and I just... 

00:26:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Now, when you say you j-, you just want to be normal... 

00:26:20
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:26:20
SANDY WILLIAMS ...it feels not normal to have all of these things on your plate? 

00:26:25
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm, I don't feel normal. 

00:26:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Oh, okay. 

00:26:25
JOANNA SKEWES Like I'm, trying to be normal. 

00:26:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Yes. How, eh, um, I mean, h-, h-, h-, how long is it since you've felt normal? 

00:26:35
JOANNA SKEWES Well 

00:26:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Is that, do you have a sense of, of, you know, your life being okay, to some point, and then kind of going off into 'not normal?' 

00:26:50
JOANNA SKEWES Just about all the time, I've felt not normal. I guess, part of it's been the drugs... 

00:26:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm-hmm? 

00:26:55
JOANNA SKEWES ...cuz of, it's been in a different, with, it's like being in a different world, really. 

00:27:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, you're right. Yeah... 

00:27:00
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:27:00
SANDY WILLIAMS And that's been in your life for quite a long time? 

00:27:00
JOANNA SKEWES Well, since I was a teenager. 

00:27:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:27:05
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah. I'm pretty young, actually. 

00:27:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:27:05
JOANNA SKEWES Yes 

00:27:05
SANDY WILLIAMS So, you started using stuff round about what age? 

00:27:10
JOANNA SKEWES 15? 

00:27:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Well, that is pretty young, but... 

00:27:10
JOANNA SKEWES To start them 

00:27:15
SANDY WILLIAMS ...I imagine, pardon? 

00:27:15
JOANNA SKEWES To start them 

00:27:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. 

00:27:15
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:27:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Which is not uncommon. 

00:27:20
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:27:20
SANDY WILLIAMS And, it was like, that was just kind of experimental, or was it something that you were pretty keen to get into? 

00:27:25
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm. sort of started experimental. 

00:27:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:27:30
JOANNA SKEWES And then, sort of, um, yeah, I don't know, started using it a lot. 

00:27:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:27:35
JOANNA SKEWES Really, pretty quickly, so, yeah. 

00:27:40
SANDY WILLIAMS When you said before, that, you know, some pretty awful stuff had happened, earlier in your life... 

00:27:45
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:27:45
SANDY WILLIAMS ...had that happened before you, you know... 

00:27:45
JOANNA SKEWES Ooh 

00:27:45
SANDY WILLIAMS ...in your earlier life, or did it happen around the time you were 15 and started using... 

00:27:50
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:27:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Is it okay if we go there for a little bit? And you tell me a little bit about that? 

00:27:55
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:27:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, okay. 

00:27:55
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah. Yeah. 

00:28:00
SANDY WILLIAMS So, how old were you when, when your, that stuff was happening to you? 

00:28:05
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm, I think it was about, it started when I was about 8. 

00:28:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:28:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Yes 

00:28:10
JOANNA SKEWES It feels yucky, talking about it. 

00:28:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Yes, absolutely. Mmm. And you said it was a family member? 

00:28:20
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:28:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm-hmm? 

00:28:20
JOANNA SKEWES Dad's brother. 

00:28:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay, that's pretty close. 

00:28:25
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:28:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Did you, did your folks know? 

00:28:25
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-mmm, they still don't. 

00:28:30
SANDY WILLIAMS They still don't? Right. 

00:28:30
JOANNA SKEWES Uh-huh. 

00:28:35
SANDY WILLIAMS So, you've carried this, you've carried this for a long time, hmm? 

00:28:40
JOANNA SKEWES It's not something that I really want to tell them. 

00:28:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Because? 

00:28:45
[sil.] 

00:28:45
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah, they're hardly gonna believe me, but... 

00:28:50
SANDY WILLIAMS They're hardly gonna believe you? That's your fear? 

00:28:50
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:28:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:28:55
JOANNA SKEWES Or, you know, I was enough of a problem then, so, I, I, it'll just tear the family apart and I just don't wan them to know. 

00:29:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:29:00
JOANNA SKEWES And... 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:05
JOANNA SKEWES ...I don't know how they'll react. 

00:29:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm 

00:29:10
JOANNA SKEWES And I, I don't know, if I'm, ready to tell them, though. 

00:29:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm 

00:29:15
JOANNA SKEWES It's... 

00:29:15
SANDY WILLIAMS I don't have an agenda that you... 

00:29:15
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:29:15
SANDY WILLIAMS ...need to tell them, I guess, it's just important for us to look at, you know, what, what might have have, kind of, set you off on a, on a path where... 

00:29:25
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:29:25
SANDY WILLIAMS ...you know, you've encountered difficulty, and things have got more complex... 

00:29:30
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:29:30
SANDY WILLIAMS ...than you want them to be, hmm? And it's a huge thing for, a child, to be sexually abused by a close member of the family. It's kind of the ultimate in betrayal. 

00:29:40
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:29:45
SANDY WILLIAMS It should never have happened. 

00:29:45
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:29:45
SANDY WILLIAMS It should never have happened. 

00:29:45
JOANNA SKEWES It just makes me feel so gross. 

00:29:50
SANDY WILLIAMS It makes you feel gross. 

00:29:50
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:29:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Yeah. 

00:29:50
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:29:55
SANDY WILLIAMS But you and I both know than an 8-year-old would never do anything to invite that happening to them. Hmm? Hmm? 

00:30:00
JOANNA SKEWES I just, I just felt like I could have stopped it. 

00:30:05
SANDY WILLIAMS You could've stopped it? At 8? 

00:30:10
JOANNA SKEWES I got older, though. That was the thing, I could've stopped it. 

00:30:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:30:10
JOANNA SKEWES When I got older. 

00:30:15
SANDY WILLIAMS And how old was your uncle? At the time it started? 

00:30:20
JOANNA SKEWES He would've have been in his 40's. 

00:30:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. And I imagine that he said some things along the way, that led you to believe that if you did tell anybody, there was gonna be big trouble. 

00:30:30
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm. 

00:30:35
[sil.] 

00:30:35
JOANNA SKEWES Told me it was, told me... 

00:30:40
[sil.] 

00:30:40
JOANNA SKEWES ...that I liked it, and... 

00:30:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So he, really, he really got in your head, didn't he? You know, in a, in a way that was really bad. 

00:30:50
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:30:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm-hmm? 

00:30:50
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:30:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. And he's got ya to, still believe, that telling people, you wouldn't be believed, and you've been, you would be seen to be a bad person. Hmm? Yeah. So, he was pretty clever. 

00:31:15
[sil.] 

00:31:15
SANDY WILLIAMS You know, I guess I'd wanna really challenge the notion that, an 8-year-old, could, in any way, make this happen. And, I'd also want to challenge the notion that an 8-year-old, or a 9-year-old, or a 10-year-old, however long it went on, who had been drawn into that kind of world, with a, an older man getting in their head space. With all sorts of, you know, skewed logic. That you had the capacity to make it stop happening. Hmm? 

00:31:50
JOANNA SKEWES It was... 

00:31:50
SANDY WILLIAMS How long did it go on, Jo? 

00:31:55
JOANNA SKEWES Years. 

00:31:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:32:00
[sil.] 

00:32:00
SANDY WILLIAMS And what, was it still happening at the point that you started to use a bit of (inaudible) at school? Yeah? And my guess is, that you using a bit of (inaudible) gave you a bit of respite from some of this stuff that was going on in your head. Hmm? Gave you a chance to chill out a bit. You know? Feel a bit soft, feel a bit, have a bit of fun, get the munchices, have laughs, like the kids do. Yeah? 

00:32:25
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:32:25
SANDY WILLIAMS So you could be a kid? 

00:32:30
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:32:35
[music] 

00:32:35
Finding the Ally Within 

00:32:35
the way forward 

00:32:35
SANDY WILLIAMS That was a pretty creative, pretty clever way to handle a lot of stuff that was going on inside you, at the time. Mmm? 

00:32:50
JOANNA SKEWES That's one way 

00:32:50
SANDY WILLIAMS It was kind of a strategy that you used, to manage, what was unmanageable, really, in, in, when you were stone cold sober. 

00:33:00
JOANNA SKEWES That's true. 

00:33:00
SANDY WILLIAMS That is true. 

00:33:05
[sil.] 

00:33:05
SANDY WILLIAMS What's the sigh about? 

00:33:05
JOANNA SKEWES Why me? 

00:33:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Why you? 

00:33:10
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:33:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. That's a fair enough question. 

00:33:15
JOANNA SKEWES What is it about me? 

00:33:15
SANDY WILLIAMS What is it about you? 

00:33:15
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:33:20
[sil.] 

00:33:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Feels like, it's not fair, that, that happened, and the whole sting of things that have happened since... 

00:33:25
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:33:25
SANDY WILLIAMS ...then. Yeah. 

00:33:35
SANDY WILLIAMS I guess that's why I say what I said a few moments ago, which is, it's gonna be really important for you, from here on, to be your biggest, and strongest, and most compassionate ally in this process. You know? If you, kind of, think about yourself as gross, as inadequate, as a bad mum, as a bad daughter, as a bad partner, whatever. That's gonna make it a helluva lot harder than, you can't, somehow, see yourself as someone who a series of things happened... 

00:34:05
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:34:05
SANDY WILLIAMS ...that really went back a long way, um, that would've interfered with, kind of, normal development. You know? We talked about what's normal. 

00:34:10
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:34:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm? 

00:34:15
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:34:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah? I think if you get the whip out on yourself, you know, that's gonna give you three things to deal with, you know? Sorting through all the challenges on your plate at the moment... 

00:34:25
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:34:25
SANDY WILLIAMS ...but, if in the process, you're also telling yourself that you're a, you know, you're a gross, rotten person, as well, that's kind of... 

00:34:30
JOANNA SKEWES Making it worse? 

00:34:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Absolutely! 

00:34:35
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. It's the stuff I've always done, though, I guess. 

00:34:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm? 

00:34:40
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:34:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Well, you had pretty good training to question yourself, going way back. Hmm? 

00:34:50
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:34:50
SANDY WILLIAMS And, in some ways, it's... 

00:34:50
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:34:50
SANDY WILLIAMS ...it's a shame that your folks didn't know, somehow, and, and could've responded in a way that, that it would've, [0b0:35:00]would've been supportive and helpful. 

00:34:55
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:34:55
SANDY WILLIAMS That can happen, but didn't. Hmm? 

00:35:05
JOANNA SKEWES I was too scared to tell 'em at the time. 

00:35:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, yeah. 

00:35:10
SANDY WILLIAMS So you moved in, to kind of, you know, experimenting with a bit of (inaudible), and that did the trick... 

00:35:15
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:35:15
SANDY WILLIAMS And, you know, as you know, drugs, after a while, though, can take on a bit of a life of their own, and so it kind of spiraled. Mmm? 

00:35:20
JOANNA SKEWES And it did. 

00:35:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Such that... 

00:35:25
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:35:25
SANDY WILLIAMS ...you can't, kind of, do without them. Mmm? 

00:35:25
JOANNA SKEWES It's, sort of, got away from them, really 

00:35:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, yeah. 

00:35:30
JOANNA SKEWES So, you know, I was using too deep before I realized it, really. 

00:35:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. But, you've, you've said some, at several points, in the, in the discussion we've had so far, that you recognized when things have gotten too far away from you... 

00:35:45
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:35:45
SANDY WILLIAMS ...and you've done something about it. Hmm? 

00:35:45
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:35:45
SANDY WILLIAMS You've either told your partner about what's happening that you don't want to see happening. 

00:35:50
JOANNA SKEWES That's true. 

00:35:50
SANDY WILLIAMS You went on the program . 

00:35:50
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:35:50
SANDY WILLIAMS You've gone onto the 'done program? 

00:35:55
JOANNA SKEWES Yep 

00:35:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Um, you're telling me that sometimes you feel your head's gonna burst, and you might do some stuff with your kids that, you, you... 

00:36:00
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:36:00
SANDY WILLIAMS ..you know, is against your grain. 

00:36:00
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:36:05
SANDY WILLIAMS You've got all sorts of, kind of, safety valves in there, which, they haven't been destroyed by this process. 

00:36:10
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm. True. I hadn't thought about it that way. 

00:36:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Oh, yeah. 

00:36:10
JOANNA SKEWES That, um... 

00:36:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah 

00:36:15
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:36:15
SANDY WILLIAMS I mean, I think you need a helluva lot of help right now, I think we need to look at the things that you've talked to me, that you're dealing with on your plate at the moment... 

00:36:20
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:36:20
SANDY WILLIAMS ...and we need to work out some relief for you, you know, we need to, to see what can happen on the financial front... 

00:36:25
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:36:25
SANDY WILLIAMS You know, a bit of a relief from the kids... 

00:36:30
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:36:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Um, kind of, getting you, maybe, there's gonna be a way to tell your folks there's been another bump, but you're on the road, you're doing, you're getting some counseling, you feel really keen... 

00:36:40
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:36:40
SANDY WILLIAMS ...to sort things out, and maybe they'll be there for you, and you won't feel so lonely in the process. 

00:36:45
JOANNA SKEWES That's true. 

00:36:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah? 

00:36:45
JOANNA SKEWES That's true. 

00:36:45
SANDY WILLIAMS So, you know, I think, if we, we can sit down and work out what to do, that might help you with the things on your plate at the moment. 

00:36:55
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:36:55
SANDY WILLIAMS There are obviously bigger issues to deal with, in terms of your relationship with Adam. I mean, is this something you, you want to salvage with, what do you, you know, are things over with this man? Or do you think it's workable? 

00:37:05
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm-hmm 

00:37:05
SANDY WILLIAMS With some help. 

00:37:05
JOANNA SKEWES To be honest with you, I think he's sort of looking at (inaudble). I told him no. 

00:37:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. 

00:37:10
JOANNA SKEWES Um, it's. I just don't want to be living my life like that, with the kids, anymore. 

00:37:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. 

00:37:15
JOANNA SKEWES You know, I don't like the way I'm living my life right now, with the kids, so... 

00:37:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right 

00:37:20
JOANNA SKEWES ...I, um, even if it is harder, just want to put all this behind me, and if he's carrying on, like the way he was before he left, um... 

00:37:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm? 

00:37:30
JOANNA SKEWES ...no. 

00:37:30
SANDY WILLIAMS It sounds like you're really staking a claim for yourself, there, and the kids. 

00:37:35
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm. True. 

00:37:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:37:35
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:37:35
SANDY WILLIAMS But, I guess you'll need to, whatever happens with him, you'll need to negotiate how you're gonna relate around the children. Hmm? 

00:37:45
JOANNA SKEWES Mmm 

00:37:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Cuz the kids have a dad. Hmm? 

00:37:45
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:37:45
SANDY WILLIAMS And, if something can be worked out, if you're not gonna be reconciled, if something can be worked out where your kids can see their dad, and you feel that they're safe, you need to be reassured about that... 

00:37:55
JOANNA SKEWES Yeah 

00:37:55
SANDY WILLIAMS ...um, that may be something else that maybe we can look at together.
