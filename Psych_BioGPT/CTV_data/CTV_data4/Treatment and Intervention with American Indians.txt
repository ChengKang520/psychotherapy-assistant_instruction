JEANNETTE JOHNSON Well, thank you everybody. I'm really pleased to be here. I wanna thank Fred for inviting me but I especially want to thank Fred for introducing me to Beth. Beth and I never met before. We'd never talked before. We'd never emailed before. And I'd read some of her stuff and she'd read some, some of mine and it's one of the biggest delights of the, of the fault to meet somebody as charming and smart as Beth. So thank you very much. Um, I'm going to be talking about a background that we need to understand in order to develop effective prevention, uh, I mean effective intervention and treatments with American Indians. And so one of the things I want to start with is the importance of history and the importance of time that has to be accounted for in all of the development of our effective treatments and interventions. The events which transpired 5,000 years ago, 5 years ago or even 5 minutes ago have determined what will happen 5 minutes from now, 5 years from now or 5,000 years from now. All history is a current event. So encapsulated in that uh, phrase is what American Indians live in a day to day basis. It's also I might add something that many indigenous cultures live through. The concept that history is current. That history is present and that time is fluid. So when you develop treatments or interventions you have to take into account that concept or that world view of time. And we saw that in some of the interviews that Jill showed yesterday on, on the screen. Because when Indians talk they flip back and forth from the past to the present, from the past to the present as if it's one continuous thing. And that's how Indians think. Indians think not just in a medicine wheel but the think in a holistic way and this concept of time is a real concept. And so I'd like to demonstrate it um, more effectively with something that was taught to me when I worked with the Mari Indians in New Zealand and for this I have to walk around. But the Mari, the Mari that I was working with said that the [non-English narration] which is the European person has a different concept of what life is all about. The [non-English narration], let me take this and this, the [non-English narration] walks into the future. If this is the future and this is the past, this is the present my body in this plane, the [non-English narration] walks into the future like this with the past behind them. The present moving with them and they look to the future. However, the Mari and I'd like to say the American Indian and many indigenous cultures walk into the future like this. The past is in front of them, they walk back to the future while they look to the past. Their present is with them but they constantly are looking at their history as it informs their present and their future remains unknown. But this concept of time is not accounted for in many of the uh, developments, in many of the interventions, in many of the treatments for American Indians. It's hard to grab. It's hard to wrap your brain around but it's actually how American Indians think. And if you want to get a change in thinking, change in behavior, influencing how people live you have to really intergrade how that concept of time and how that concept of history is so important to their present day functioning. So I'm going to be talking about cultural trauma, inner-generational trauma and how that concept of time, how that concept of history not just effects American Indians thinking but how it effects this biochemical machine which is our body. Because what is also important with American Indians is the holistic perspective. We have a lot of evidence from neuroscience, we have a lot of evidence from genetics but what we think influences our body and vice versa. And there's a woman named Candice Purt who said the mind is not in the brain, the mind is in every cell, single cell of the body. That you can find your mind in your stomach, you can find your mind in your feet, you can find your mind in your body. That mind can be seen on a cellular level from the influence of neurotransmitters, transmitters to how we feel to the influence of meditation and Yoga and in Indian culture ceremonies how it affects our body. So the holistic perspective has a language. Time has a language and it has not really been incorporated into our treatments and interventions with American Indians. So why should the Native American experience be the organizing feature of treatment? Why indeed? Why would be bother? It's very complicated. It provides the experience of the person not just the Native American, provides a context for self-definition. What happened to my grandmother or what happened to my father or what happened to me provides a context of self-def-, definition. My grandmother was born on the Heron Reservation in Canada, a small tiny reservation. The Herons were practically killed out. Part, her parents were also Mohawk. My father was born in Canada and when he came to Detroit that's where I was born. But the first day of school my mother said don't tell anyone you're an Indian. So inherit in that is the con-, the self-definition. So what does that mean? Hide it, be ashamed of it, be embarrassed by it, and don't let anyone know. The concept of shame has influenced my behavior, not just me many people's behaviors. And so that experience should be the organizing feature of treatment. But is anybody gonna ask me if I go to see a therapist because I'm depressed, were you ever ashamed of your Indianness when you were a little girl? No, they aren't even gonna ask if I was an Indian actually. So, the Native American experience provides context for the production of goods and services. As therapist these are our services, these are our resources. My experience if you develop an intervention or a treatment from me you need to account for my experience and you need to understand it. It provides anxiety buffering structures and enhances my self-esteem and it did in later years. Being released from the shame and embarrassment from being an Indian from what my mother told me uh, helped me understand that there was great pride and it was great uh, there was uh, a wonderment that I had yet to discover about being an Indian. And so in that case it helped me develop my own resilient factors, my own resilient, my own resilience. My Native American experience was not lost on me and it's not lost on many Native Americans when they come together. It provides rules and prescriptions for life. The ceremony of the Native American have helped many people overcome many kinds of problems. And finally it provides protection and I talked about resilience. So, my Native American, if you, my Native American experience as is the Native American experience of many Indians can, can help develop a treatment and intervention in, in a way that speaks to them as an individual, that speak to them as a group and helps the developer understand the process of our thinking. So the diversity of the American Indian and Alaskan Native group, Gone talked about it yesterday and the other Gone talked about it yesterday as well. There's 565 federally recognized American Indian tribes and Alaskan Native groups. To say nothing of the First Nations People and the Mate in Canada. And so when you add them all up you have a widely diverse, you have a uh, a, a group of people who speak many different languages, many cultures, traditions, ways of dress, food, eating, uh, the, you know, from the salmon fishermen in the Pacific Northwest to the rice gatherers in Minnesota to the Plains Indians to the Indians down in Florida to the Apache down in uh, Arizona to the many Indian tribes in California. You have a vault, wide and vast diversity. And so the, the, how do you address this diversity in developing an evidence based treatment? Well, I don't think you can. I don't think you can address the diversity. But what Beth will be talking about is addressing the process. So to make the process evidence base as a little different way of thinking other than making the product evidence based. So the diversity within the American Indian/Alaskan Native group has many different reasons for the diversity. It's not just because, oops, it's not just because we speak a different language but federal policies adapted to us as Indians were different. Some of us were relocated and some of us weren't. Some of us were forced to go to boarding schools and some of us weren't. And the boarding school experience was a very powerful experience. Some of us were adopted out and some of us weren't. The level of acculturation is different from tribe to tribe. There are some tribes were there are no speakers left of the original language. How if, how many speakers are there in the Seneca language? Because I, I knew two when I was in New York. There were two, two old guys. 

00:10:10
UNKNOWN There's about a hundred. 

00:10:10
JEANNETTE JOHNSON About a hundred. Yeah, there, so there's about a hundred. So the languages are dying out, many of the traditions are dying out. But what's most interesting for us today is that 64% of American Indians live in urban areas. So many Indians, most Indians live in the big city. So these Indians flock to the big city for jobs or a small city like in Baltimore, but you have Suez with Lumbees(ph), with Black Feet, with uh, Apaches, with Mohawks, with Herons all living in one area coming together with this diversity. How do you develop a treatment in a city for this diversity. So, Okay, let's click on this. Okay. Now we often talk about health disparities so let's take a look just briefly at some of the health disparities in American Indians. And this is from a report by Walker in 2006 and the data still stands today. American Indians have a six times greater incidence of alcoholism, six times incidence, greater incidence of TB, a three and a half time greater incidence of diabetes. They have more accidents, they have more suicides, they have more PTSD. They have lower educational achievement. They live in worst houses, their poverty is three times greater, and their health care access, access is three times worse. So these disparities are they, what are they a result of? Are they the result of the individual who just doesn't try to go to school. Are they the result of eating too much fatty food. Is it a result of just uh, the genetics of alcoholism. Well, we're here to tell you that it's not just a result of the individual which is a Western notion of care. It's not just the individual in American Indians but the world view or the most Indians believe they are part of a greater whole; that is the collective. And it's not just the collective of Indians it's the collective of people as they move across time. It is what happened to the seven generations ago to the sixth generation ago to the fifth generation that influences it. So let's take one last look at what's happening here with these health disparities. These health disparities show you a mind body connection because alcoholism is a disease of the body, TB is a disease of the body. And most, and most health disparities are the diseases of the body. Now how could thinking affect the make or affect the disease of the body? And it's because of what happens when you, when you do something that your body reacts to it. And so if you drink too much you, you can uh, drink enough, have larnikeesencipholitus(ph), have a brain disease. If you eat too much sugar when you're too old and you're too overweight you can have diabetes. So the thinking and the behavior and the affect on the body affects the Indian in the way that the Indian believes. And the Indian believes that the holistic person, the holistic view is what matters when you want to treat a mental illness. So if somebody comes, so there are no interventions around that really, that really point to the holistic view of the individual in helping the whole person. So, the causes of behavioral health disparities and this is common list, you see it everywhere especially in youth. Uh, there's high levels of violence. There's a lot of oppression and race, racism. There's not enough money to go around for care. There's of course a disregard for effective indigenous practices. There's an over reliance on evidence based uh, treatment uh, and practices. And these evidence based pract-, uh, practices as I've just talked about are hard to come by given the diversity within the American Indians, given the concept, the real view or the concept of time and history that is not accounted for. And there's a lack of cult-, uh, what is known, what we know as academics is cultural competence but can be translated in the real world as not understanding the Indian experience. Understanding the Indian experience will help develop a prop-, help, uh, uh, develop a process for an effective intervention. Will you let me know when I have 10 minutes left to my 25 minutes thanks. So, I want to talk about this in a global sense. So I've given you a little precursor for what we're now gonna talk about which is cultural trauma. Cultural trauma defined by Alexander is a horrendous event that leaves indelible marks upon the consciousness of members of a collectivity, and changes their identity fundamentally and irrevocably. So cultural trauma is an idea, granted it's an idea. Is there data behind cultural trauma? There is data provided by Les Wettback and actually I, I did a paper with urban Indians where we found incidents of cultural trauma in urban, in urban Indians. But it's a wide ranging uh, thing to think about. It's a wide ranging opinion. And there's a lot of controversy about cultural trauma but not in the American Indian community. Cultural trauma, I have 10 minutes left, okay, thanks, alters the basic structure of the cultural system as a whole. Now how could a cultural trauma do that? Well, you can think about something as simple as Katrina. How did Katrina alter the cultural system as a whole down in New Orleans; in many different ways. It revealed the substandard housing, it revealed how, how this, a certain segment of the population was ignored and not cared for. How did for example cultural trauma in the Trail of Tears, making Indians march from say uh, Georgia to Kansas where they were marched to, killed along the way. How did that trauma effect those people, those Cherokees especially at that time. Many died out, many families were separated, uh, many children were taken away and there, and that cultural trauma effected them as a whole. What happens is the mechanisms, the homeostatic mechanisms might not function to restore the culture. So what are homeostatic mechanisms in contemporary society? Give 'em more money, let's see if that money's gonna help them. How many people do we know, do I know, many that have money and it hasn't helped. Money does not make you middle-class, money does not send you to school, money does not buy you a house. What buys you a house, what sends you to school, and what makes you healthier are the ways you think about how you're gonna help yourself and your people. And so, the homeostatic mechanism uh, commonly money, throw money at them is not the answer. I mean the ans-, I don't really have the answer but the answer is the, is in listening to the people, developing effective treatment intervention that speak to their experience, and helping them learn how to de-, find um, resilience. Cultural trauma, when the cultural is overwhelmed by trauma it loses its ability to protect and support its members. It disintegrates, it has no choice it's been weakened by this trauma. And it, and, and from that weakened state where we see health disparities. There are cultural traumatic events: colonialism, slavery, war, genocide, terrorism, natural disasters like hurricanes, um, forced relocation, and epidemic disease. Epidemic disease, the epidemic disease of HIV in the early '80s really was culturally traumatic for the gay population in San Francisco. It changed and strengthened them but at the time when it first, from when it first was announced many people were ashamed of it. So it's that concept of trauma which influences the behavior. So effective, effects of cultural trauma on the collective we can see for example in the loss of identity. Cul-, I cannot say to you why my mother told me to not tell anybody I was an Indian except that there were many people that I've talked to who were like that, many people did not admit were, when they were younger had this, were embarrassed or ashamed of some aspect of them self. This was an effect of longstanding cultural trauma and it helps to maintain the loss of identity. How do people come to their identity to make them whole again and how do we take that identity and development, in the development of our interventions and treatments. So trauma is what we see, cultural trauma is what we see in our worl-, in our therapy when we see individuals for therapy. They're over anxious, they have a lot of grief, they're paranoid, they have PTSD, disease, health problems, substance abuse, domestic violence, and something we, I'll introduce you to as historical or intergenerational trauma. Tell me when I have five minutes, okay. 

00:19:35
UNKNOWN You have five minutes. 

00:19:35
JEANNETTE JOHNSON Okay, thanks. Um, so, I'd like to go back to this slide. Events alone don't inherently create trauma. It's not the event that creates the trauma it's the meaning that you give to the event. The trauma process, the meaning that you give the event is accomplished in a larger picture by what people are telling you the meaning of that is. And if you don't have the inner strength or the collective strength to make meaning out of that treatment that meaning can either knock you over like a boo-boo doll or bring you back up. And so it's the meaning that Indians give to this cultural trauma. So, I'm a slip over to here. So examples of historical trauma or intergenerational trauma are genocide, uh the Jewish holocaust, slavery, and even the crusades were examples of historical trauma. So cultural trauma would be something that happened today like Katrina or a, a fire in Southern California. What is historical trauma or intergenerational trauma? It is this thing that happened to my grandparents, two generations, three generations ago. The stories that were told about that trauma in a way that it's influenced my life today. So intergenerational trauma they, uh, has affects me as an Indian as well as cultural trauma. The cultural trauma, I have to say because of the Indian resurgence among many Indi-, or Indians is not so traumatic. Many Indians are proud to be Indian, many Indians are seeking to understand their past, and many Indians are not affected by the cultural trauma as they were in the '50s because there was not, there's hardly, there's no shame being an Indian anymore. But the historical trauma lives on. So this historical trauma influences our responses. And Marie Braveheart calls this the historical trauma response. And it might include substance abuse. It might as eve-, as a vehicle for attempting to numb yourself of many other things. It includes other kinds of self-destructive behavior, suicide, anxiety, and that whole list of things that you see in the therapy room that you try to treat. So, the historical unresolved grief process what Maria Braveheart calls is the, is the thing, the feeling that accompanies the behavior or the trauma. The grief maybe considered impaired, delayed, fixated and/or disenfranchised. And she has developed an intervention for treating the historical unresolved grief process. So there are many traumas that Indians live through from first contact, to colonization, to the last one the BIA Relocation Program. Indians were forced off the, of reservations during the Trail of Tears and then the, and then they were forced back on to reservations with the BIA Relocation Program. So what Indians lived through and I'm gonna leave you with this before Beth gives you uh, an astounding presentation. Um, so buffalo or the four-leggeds if you can see this. This is a picture of buffalo hides. So Indians had two-leggeds, us and they had four-leggeds which they used as their life force. Buffalo were not killed for their skin, they were killed to eat. But when the Westerners came in they kill-, especially at the New York were all the lakes were and where they the uh, the snow was um, to get the hides of the, of the animals to sell and make coats and blankets. That was a trauma to the Indians. They saw these piles and piles of fur. So, what else was a trauma to the Indian? The Western came in and they hired under-, other Indians to go get, to be trappers and to go get these furs. And so they disenfranchised, they broke a po-, the group. And um, at that point the culture started to disintegrating in a subtle yet meaningful way. Another trauma, the Trail of Tears, marched from Georgia all the way to Kansas to Quapaw country. Uh, but there were many Trail of Tears where Indians were, yes, one minute, Okay, I'll be done. Uh, there were many Trail of Te-, Tears that Indians were forced to, to march on. This broke apart families, killed people, um, and it just was another sign of the disintegrate, another way to disintegrate the culture. We have the Wounded Knee Massacre where Sitting Bull was just marching his people across. And they were killed by the Calvary because they were the Indian wars. And we have finally one last one it's a heartbreaker actually, it's the Carlisle Indian School. Pueblo children before and after, Indian children were taken off the reservation and you can see them in this picture, and they were forced to go to school. And the schools model in Pennsylvania was, was this: kill the Indian to save the man. And this picture is all the Indian kids at the Carlisle Indian School that were taken from their parents. Kill the Indian save the man meant what? It meant get rid of the Indian culture and assimilate them to our culture because we're the better culture. And so, with this background of understanding cultural and historical trauma, and with the motto of "Kill the Indian and save the man" we address what we need to do for Indians in the development of evidence based treatment. So in developing treatment how do we keep into account the fluidity of time, the importance of treat-, of understanding cultural trauma, the importance of understanding how history effects us and the world view that our future is not in front of us but our future is behind us. So, bye. 

00:25:45

00:25:50
BETH BOYD Thank you Jeannette for giving such a, a good context. And I think it's, it's very um, it's important to recognize the we, we have to keep this context in mind as we go forward in thinking about intervention. I think this is, I, I'm a member of the Seneca Nation. I'm originally from New York state but I live in South Dakota. I've been there for about 20 years. When I first moved there I was made very aware of how history is in um, in our lives every day. In South Dakota there are people still alive whose grandparents survived the Wounded Knee Massacre. Um, so, it is raw, it is, it is still pain, it is very much alive and it's here with us every day. And so as people understand that um, their self and their community includes not only themselves but those ancestors are part of how they um, define themselves. So, it's, I'll talk a little bit more about that in a minute. But it's very much of importance. So as we think about um, developing interventions that will be appropriate with Native people we have to consider this context. Uh, we have to know what the sociopolitical history of the particular group is. And it needs to be specific for that group because we have many different histories, many different traumas, many different um, experiences uh, in, in contact with the Western world. The continuing transfer of unresolved trauma and grief across the generations. Children now hear those stories. They understand um, what has happened to their ancestors as not as ancestors so far removed themselves. They understand that as their family now. And so that trauma is being um, generated across the uh, or, uh, continued across the generations. Um, the complication of socioeconomic issues and the current and past experiences of racism and trauma of an oppression. Um, as Gone/Bahn(ph) mentioned yesterday um, the Indian Health Service has been tasked with providing um, mental, the health and behavioral health services for Native communities. Which means about 700 reservation based hospitals, clinics, and other facilities, and um, 30, there's 34 urban clinics that also include uh, some sort of behavioral health in most of those. Um, the Indian Health Service is divided into 12 service areas across the country um, which are vast. Um, for example the National area covers um, areas from Maine to Texas. And so there are many cultures and um, uh, languages and um, different practices pr-, in, in between them. Um, the most reservation and urban based Native communities have some sort health and behavioral services um, and behavioral health services uh, through IHS but the funding is uh, continuing problem. Um, 2010 10% of the funds allocated for clinical services um, to IHS was dedicated to behavioral health. So um, and personal health care expenditures for that IHS user population per capita was about 27 hundred um, dollars compared to about $69 hundred in the general population. So, un-, under funding is a constant issue. Staffing is often in-, inadequate um, for, because many of these uh, facilities are in very rural areas it's difficult to keep people and a lot of times uh, people are just fulfilling their payback requirements for uh, their educational uh, um, financial aid and so they're often only there for a year or two. And the higher you go um, in terms of uh, level of, of the profession they, the greater the turnover is. The less likely you are to find a Native professional providing services. Um, those services that are often are, that are offered are often not used and that's for a number of reasons. Sometimes it has to do with confidentiality in a small community, sometimes it is distrust of anything having to do with the US government. Um, sometimes there is stigma and misunderstandings of past interventions. In one community I was in where um, there had been a large number of youth suicides um, they had one half time masters level health person for the entire community of about 3,000 people. So there is no way that person could handle all of the um, issues that were happening there. And so whenever a young person made a suicidal um, gesture or had any suicidal ideation this child was sent several hundred miles away to a hospital and the, and the nearest city. Because of financial and transportation issues the family was often not able to go with their child. So the child would stay four or five days but stabilize, so put on medicine, sent back to the community with no after care. The family was not informed of what the medicine was about. In the next month or so that child committed suicide. The families understood they took their child to a mental health person, their child was sent away, something was done to them, and they came back and committed suicide. That was the understanding. So, the, even with inadequate services there are people still literally, um, arrived there. There were dozens and dozens of suicidal attempts that have not even been reported to mental health because of that kind of understanding in, in the community. Um, and no explanations of services that makes any kind of sense to clients. In another community we did interviews on um, of, uh, consumers and family members, um, people who have severe and persistent uh, illness. Over 90% of them consumers and family members did not have any idea what the diagnosis was, had no idea what the medicine was that they prescribed, and no idea why they were taking it. So, you can imagine why it would be um, difficult to uh, comply um, in those kinds of situations where you have no idea what um, what you're being asked to do. So evidence-based treatments for Native people, I mean we've heard over and over again that ethnocultural populations are underrepresented resunted, I, I'm sorry, there's not enough in there in the efficacy studies. Um, and um, luckily Dr. Bahn has done a review of the literature um, uh, for mental health interventions for Native people experiencing psychological distress. Of 56 out of the present chapters identified um, the vast majority of these did not systematically assess outcome of specified treatments under um, controlled conditions. Of nine studies that did do this only two were controlled studies with adequate sample size and interpretable results um, relative to evidence based treatments. These were two quasi experimental outcome studies um, both adaptations of mainstream approaches. One was the Mason and Brennenman, um, uh, adapted uh, the coping with depression curriculum for 22 older Native people with chronic health problems. Um, and the other was the, LaFromboise and Howard-Pittney um, the Zuni life skills curriculum which is a school based um, uh, skill curriculum for um, those kids who are risk for suicide. Um, there were no studies of treatment outcome using traditional Native approaches for healing. So, as, as Gone has um, raised the question yet what are mental health practitioners to do when um, pressed to use evidence based treatments uh, but no empirical evidence to turn to. Um, in terms of cul-, treatment adaptations um, culturally adapted um, evidence based treatments for ethnocultural populations include um, these four, um, oh, um, five or six here. I'm sorry. Um, the programs that have looked at symptoms of depression and PTSD. Um, the LaFromboise and Howard-Pitney um, the study looking at uh, a risk for suicide. Um, Dee BigFoot had done a lot of work with um, sexual abuse trauma in a cultural adapted CBT. And um, a couple of uh, programs that looked at um, that addressed substance abuse departments. Um, so we find that overall mental health um, interventions with cultural adaptations are moderately more effective than uh, with ethnocultural clients than those that are not. But they're seldom done with Native populations and there are no studies of clinic based interventions with Native people. So, it raises the question of relevance um, of evidence based treatments in Native communities for all the reasons that we've heard over the past couple of days. Are they valid assessments for psychological attributes and outcomes for Native people? Um, is there cultural congruence of Western models for intervention and evaluation? Are the targets relevant? Are we assessing, the ways that we asses them um, valid in this context? So cultural competence is one way of uh, in the absence of EBTs for, for treating uh, ethnocultural um, populations which focuses on the clinicians acquiring some requisite amount of skills and self-awareness, and knowledge to be able to provide effective services. That how do we know how, what is the, the right amount? How do we deal with it, uh, intergroup diversity. Even um, in the, if the, if we could know that many clinicians, clinicians do not use evidence based treatments in clinical practice. And even if all of those conditions were met it may not, it may not be preferred by Native people. So, have to remember that they use Western psychology has, does have a culture. I hear my students talking about how they're doing cultural free therapies sometimes. And I just shrug you have to understand that psychology itself has, has a culture. It's infused with cultural notions of the appropriate outcome, what wellness looks like, who the target of interventions, how a "well" person will be relative to others around them, who should do the "helping" and the "healing", how psychological healing is uh, positioned relative to the whole person. And these are all things that um, are part of how we look at what we do from a psychology perspective. In taking a Native perspective um, there are many people who believe that traditional uh, that healing, traditional healing methods do not need to validated um, by Western scientific methods. That we know what works. And we um, talk with people who are in the community and doing the work, and um, who are working with Native people um, and who have been in the roles of working with Native people and Native healing for, um, forever they, they'll talk about we have ways of knowing that are different but also valid. Um, and they, if you're truly going to be helpful in a community you need to derive um, outcome to the expectations of the community. Um, expectations like who goes for help, who, what does that look like, who uh, who gives help, and who's involved. What is the expected outcome? From this perspective uh, clinicians need to draw upon the cultural strengths in the context of the community in respect to uh, respect local uh, definitions of wellness and healing, and incorporate these, this field driven kind of knowledge into our phases of treatment including engagement, assessment, diagnosis, intervention, and after care. Um, altery-, see which things I can skip here. Um, so, Gone talked yesterday about his alternative communities for generations. It uses community defined practiced based evidence for effective treatment in Native people. And in fact it uses the culture as treatment. And here Dr. Gone um, recommends that at least one rigorous demonstration that um, rather than starting with an evidence based treatment an trying to adapt it to um, uh, a Native community that we instead start with uh, a locally grounded mental health intervention on the basis of a Native ethnopsychology and therapeutic tradition for evaluation with regard to um, locally specified outcome criteria. So community defined intervention, um, I found, I do a lot of disaster mental health work is I found that thinking about this from a disaster mental health perspective is kind of um, helpful. Um, it was that perspective we were talking about um, normalization, instilling hope, um, engaging strength, restrengthening uh, culture, um, and it has to be completely community based. It has to be, it has to come from, it has to be locally defined. And um, we require practitioners to um, be-, become involved in the community, to understand who the community is and for the community to get to know who they are. Making relationships with community members, Elders, decision-makers, cultural and spiritual leaders, natural helpers in the community. We have, we have to identify and build on strength in the community, learn about the sociopolitical history, understand how the community has been resilient in the past in the face of adversity. Learn about local understandings of health, wellness, unwellness, help and healing. And support local healers and leaders to fulfill their traditional roles. That means making collaborative partnerships with traditional healers. And empowering the community to provide support for each other. Um, for example in [non-English narration] of uh, and it's hard to put it, [non-English narration] of understanding on well-, wellness is a balance. Not only a balance between physical, mental, and emotional, and spiritual parts of the self but a balance between the self and the creator, the people all around us, the relatives, and the environment. So, unwellness is an unbalance, something in that is unbalanced. So there is no way to come in and only address the emotional or mental part of, of health to help the person um, heal. So, um, restoring balance is, is a, what has often been through ceremony, through traditional healing. We don't go to ceremony alone, we go with the community, we go with our relatives. Um, and relatives includes everyone. Um, ceremony requires discipline, commitment, personal and community cooperation, and responsibility for healing. Um, it requires a delayed gratification. It does, some of those processes that we were talking about this morning. Um, it provides uh, many preventive kinds of um, pieces. Provides children with healthy role models and understanding of how they fit into the community. They do not have to wonder who they are and how they fit in because they know who they are by how they fit in. Um, it honors the wisdom and experience of Elders and gives them a special role in the community. It gives people the opportunity to identify and express emotions in an affect holding environment. It shows those who are suffering the support of the community around them. The um, young men, learn to manage conflict as they sit around the drum and are responsible for the heartbeat of the Nation. They um, others learn about uh, leadership by um, learn how to inspire and empowering others by pushing others up to do the best that they can. Um, but, uh, uh, last night I saw a, a documentary on CNN about the Orca whales and um, it just sort of struck me they talked about um, that they travel as a family and they always stay together as a family, as a community. And that they, the whole self, whole sense of self seems to be distributed amongst the members of the group. It's just, it's, it struck me as that so much like um, uh, what I'm trying to express about how a Native community works and when it's in balance and working well. Um, when someone is grieving there's a process with the community to um, help them um, wipe their tears and come back into the circle of the community. Healing from this perspective is not, isn't passive like taking a pill. It's not even active like doing homework assignments. It is a constant movement and process of be-, balance between the self, the community, the uh, creator, the others, the environment. And so if any, it's like a see-saw, anybody got off of it, it would throw the balance completely off. So we need to be able to approaching healing from that perspective. So, need um, I think Jeannette this is probably gonna, we need to provide interventions that can be shown to be um, effective. We need to find demonstra-, demonstrate them in ways that are culturally congruent. Um, incorporate those culturally relevant metaphors and um, I know you're gonna talk in front of me. Look at us two. Allowing us to take on different roles that weren't.

JEANNETTE JOHNSON Well, Beth wanted me to come up and help close the talk about the importance of language of the people in the time that's important with the people and understanding the social justice perspective which in Native Americans is really understanding that the, that the collective is just as important as the individual. And so the language of the people remind me of the discussion we were having yesterday. And I thought one of the problem, I talked with her and I said, one of the problems is that we think in boxes and lines. We think about a box that's uh, intervention, a group of people that can fit in and we analyze it using uh, statistics that require boxes, you know ourselves. And that our lines uh, that we draw from point A to point B are just so esthetical to the way the Native American people live that we, we need a new language in which to analyze the data because the data is going to be data of fluidity and process. And I don't just mean qualitative data although that's partially included. And so, taking on the different roles other than the 50 minute hour, it might mean that we need longer sessions or shorter sessions, or sessions in the home, or sessions at the school, or sessions at the gas station where you know a lot of reservation people congregate. And finally our social justice perspective really calls that we have a, an attitude of respect for the people and not a talk down approach which is I know more and you know less. So, in that we'll close. Thank you very much.
