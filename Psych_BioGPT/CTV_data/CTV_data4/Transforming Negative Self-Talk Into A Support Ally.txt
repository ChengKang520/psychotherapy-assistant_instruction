Steve Andreas, MA 

00:00:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, I'm Steve Andreas. This is Pat, Pat just volunteered. We haven't met before. I've just got her voice which is, I'm never going to be smart enough. So when you hear this voice inside, can you hear it now? 

00:00:45
UNKNOWN Umm… can I hear? Well, it's there it's usually there most of the time, you know like that. 

00:00:55
STEVE ANDREAS Up here on the left side. 

00:00:55
UNKNOWN On the left side I don't know. 

00:01:00
STEVE ANDREAS Well, yeah, that where you gesturing. 

00:01:00
UNKNOWN Okay, we'll say it's on the left. 

00:01:00
STEVE ANDREAS Well, close your eyes. 

00:01:00
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:01:05
STEVE ANDREAS Listen to the voice and find out where it is. You seemed to have a little doubt, although, I trust your hand. 

00:01:15
(crosstalk) 

00:01:20
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, I can't do anything about that but maybe the sound people can. Sound person. What is the problem specifically? 

00:01:30
UNKNOWN Unclear. 

00:01:35
STEVE ANDREAS Unclear. Well, I think my voice itself is relatively clear or a little harsh. Can you hear me right now? Yes and no. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:01:50
STEVE ANDREAS Yes, back there. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:01:55
STEVE ANDREAS Well, I'm gonna go ahead and we'll see if sound guy can fix things up, for us. Okay, so where is it located? 

00:02:05
UNKNOWN Okay, where is it located umm… it must be left, it's my hand right, that's the one that likes to gesture? 

00:02:15
UNKNOWN Okay. And then I'll see your hand in a loop. 

00:02:15
UNKNOWN In a Loop, that's… so it's, we're gonna guess, I'm gonna guess, I'm gonna assume. I don't know much, do I, that's the problem. I'm gonna go if it's, it's here in this, it's kind of in the space. But my hand helps me to find it. 

00:02:35
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:02:35
UNKNOWN That's all I can tell you. 

00:02:35
STEVE ANDREAS Now, you just ring with your hand like this all run over. 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:02:40
STEVE ANDREAS There's voice for feel over and over. 

00:02:40
UNKNOWN Oh, yes. 

00:02:45
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, so this goes over and over in a loop, that's all right? 

00:02:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:02:50
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. And it's basically right in front of you. You may feel proud sit little on your left side. 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN Hmm… yes, I would agree. 

00:03:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, now notice how you feel now in response to it. Not too good right? 

00:03:05
UNKNOWN It's uneasy. 

00:03:05
STEVE ANDREAS Uneasy, yeah. And what sort of situation was this really with, to stand to come up with. 

00:03:15
UNKNOWN Umm… mostly in my professional life. 

00:03:15
STEVE ANDREAS Professional life. Okay. Now you got this circle here which kind of right in front of you. Find it what happens if you move it further to the left. To your left and hear it over there. You're still rotating it's still saying the same thing but it's more to your left. 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:03:45
STEVE ANDREAS You'll notice any shift in your response? 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN Hmm… not particularly. 

00:03:50
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Now what happens if you speed up that voice a little bit? 

00:04:00
[sil.] 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN It reminds me if when I was a child and I was uh… ill and I would, I had a fever sometimes it would be as if there are voices going faster and faster and faster and faster. 

00:04:15
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Now this may well, have a historical background. But I like to know what happens right now specifically I'm interested in. So if you speed it up right now. 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN I speed it right now what happened is. 

00:04:30
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. Like it makes it worst, right? 

00:04:35
UNKNOWN I can't identify much difference. I can't say there's a lot of difference. 

00:04:45
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Try slowing it down. Slow it down by about a third from whatever it is, to start with. 

00:05:00
[sil.] 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN It's a little less threatening. 

00:05:15
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, so is that make you feel little better? 

00:05:20
[sil.] 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. A little. 

00:05:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, not too much but a little. 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN A little. 

00:05:30
STEVE ANDREAS Can you slow down even more. 

00:05:35
[sil.] 

00:05:40
STEVE ANDREAS So I'm gonna say it the way wouldn't want you say it. I'll say it until how you consider inside. I am never 

00:05:55
[sil.] 

00:06:05
STEVE ANDREAS Going to be smart enough. You said that inside with that tempo. 

00:06:15
[sil.] 

00:06:55
STEVE ANDREAS So it's not like can you do that. 

00:07:05
UNKNOWN It's okay. It's, it's, it's still there. It's… 

00:07:10
STEVE ANDREAS It's still there but you still have the response to it to do you have a different one? 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN I think I'm, I have to say I think I'm struggling to get my physiology to calm down. Just get with the circumstances. 

00:07:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, so you worried about the people watching you? 

00:07:30
UNKNOWN No, no, I just it's, it's like here I am in this place. I don't know what I'm doing here. 

00:07:35
STEVE ANDREAS You never begin that we get enough for this, either, right? 

00:07:40
UNKNOWN Probably not. 

00:07:45
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. So what is, what is, gesture like this to your stomach? What does… it has somewhere like catching up for something like that? What is causing that? 

00:07:55
UNKNOWN Without my hands to do that? 

00:08:00
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. Well, the experience that you're having with your gestures and with your hands. 

00:08:05
[sil.] 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN I don't know I just do with my hands a lot I think I don't know. 

00:08:10
STEVE ANDREAS Which one? 

00:08:15
UNKNOWN I just do with my hands a lot. 

00:08:15
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah, that's great, that's wonderful. 

00:08:15
UNKNOWN So I'm not, I'm not sure what that, what it means or makes it happen. 

00:08:20
STEVE ANDREAS Well, you said you're having trouble concentrating. All right, something like that. 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN Well, my physiology is responding just to kind of generalize nervousness from you know coming up here and being in this context that is uncertain. 

00:08:40
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, let's choose something a little different. Did you open them… Okay, now the physiology may real be old as mine is a old too 'cause we're on stage. 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. And I'm doing something on stage that I don't ever do. 

00:08:50
STEVE ANDREAS Wanna teach, wanna teach you something that Fritz Perils taught me many years ago. Look out of the people and use your eyes hide your eyes back essentially you have experience of being watched. And instead of being watched, watch them, look around them. Look at the everybody eyes, and the smiles and the different expressions on people's faces. Get your eyes back. And I predict that, that you're under feeling better to see them rather than imagining them seeing you. 

00:09:25
[sil.] 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN I'm not on accustomed to being up front. I'm just not accustomed to being up front in this way. 

00:09:35
STEVE ANDREAS Right. 

00:09:35
UNKNOWN So it's like you're lovely, I, you know, you're all beautiful. Happy to look at you and it's all, but it's for me to be observed this intensely I guess is something that is unusual for me. 

00:09:50
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah, right. 

00:09:50
UNKNOWN And umm… scary. 

00:09:55
STEVE ANDREAS This is still scary. 

00:09:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:09:55
STEVE ANDREAS What's going to happen? 

00:10:00
UNKNOWN I know exactly was going to happen because it's pinning I'm going to cry. 

00:10:05
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, so you would cry. 

00:10:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:10:05
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, close your eyes. What is it got you to cry? What did you do inside that cause you to cry? 

00:10:20
[sil.] 

00:10:30
STEVE ANDREAS Did you say something to yourself or did you imagine some memory image or what, what went on there? 

00:10:40
[sil.] 

00:10:55
STEVE ANDREAS You tell me a little bit good about what's going on? 

00:11:00
UNKNOWN Yes. They refuse… 

00:11:00
STEVE ANDREAS I'm sorry. 

00:11:05
UNKNOWN They refuse to see me deeply. 

00:11:05
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN Well, I frighten you when you run away. 

00:11:20
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Can you hear that voice now? Did you see me deeply when you frighten me no when I frighten you? Okay? Now this sounds like it's your voice. Is that right? 

00:11:45
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Well, yeah. 

00:11:50
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Now you just ring with your hands kind of back and forth. So it's sort of your voice and sort of someone else's, isn't that right? Who else is or who else could this voice base be uh… be? 

00:12:05
[sil.] 

00:12:10
STEVE ANDREAS Who else might say this to you? 

00:12:15
[sil.] 

00:12:25
STEVE ANDREAS So no one have any clinics? I mean… 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN That's all right. I don't, it's okay, I don't need it, that's okay. 

00:12:30
STEVE ANDREAS Oh some are here. 

00:12:30
UNKNOWN Now I don't even need it that's okay. 

00:12:35
STEVE ANDREAS No problem when you tell me one. 

00:12:40
UNKNOWN Thank you. Umm… the voice is both mine and umm… people I've encountered in my life when I've been when I used to I my strength or my power or when I've… 

00:13:00
STEVE ANDREAS Pick one of these people, pick of the worst one. I don't need to know who it is. 

00:13:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:13:10
STEVE ANDREAS Just pick the worst one can you see that person? 

00:13:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:13:10
STEVE ANDREAS Can you see them as they say this? You've been saying it to yourself. Sensually they've been saying it to you. 

00:13:25
[sil.] 

00:13:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:13:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. As you see this person saying us, you know who this person is right? 

00:13:40
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:13:40
STEVE ANDREAS You know something about their history or who they are? 

00:13:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:13:45
STEVE ANDREAS Are they related to you and so on? 

00:13:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:13:50
STEVE ANDREAS Something about their limitations and their strengths and all the stuff. 

00:13:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:13:55
STEVE ANDREAS As you see this person saying this to you does not clarify the message at all. Does it change the message at all, does it change your response at all? It may or may not. 

00:14:10
UNKNOWN It's a very old and bettered message. 

00:14:15
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. That's fine and I don't need to know much about it. I just want you to answer my questions though. 

00:14:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:14:25
[sil.] 

00:14:30
UNKNOWN I'll do my best to answer your questions. Does it change it in any way? 

00:14:35
STEVE ANDREAS When you see this person saying this to you, you were saying it to yourself a little while ago, right? 

00:14:40
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. 

00:14:45
STEVE ANDREAS And then it was when it brought your tears. Now someone else is saying it to you, does that change your response to it? You're not crying right now I notice. So I guess a change at least somewhat. 

00:14:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:15:00
[sil.] 

00:15:05
STEVE ANDREAS Does it, does it bring tears now? 

00:15:05
UNKNOWN Not at this moment. 

00:15:10
STEVE ANDREAS Not at this moment? 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN Not at this moment. 

00:15:10
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. All right. So that's a pretty significant shift, isn't it? 

00:15:15
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:15:15
STEVE ANDREAS Just a little while ago you were crying quite a lot. 

00:15:20
[sil.] 

00:15:25
STEVE ANDREAS Now, I want you to expand the context you've already got the person. In the words of this uh… and you know something about this person. So that expands the context somewhat. I want to expand the context even more so that you see the surroundings, the time and the place where this was said to you. And I might have been said to you several times but just pick one. The work place. And see more of the context around this message that was given to you. 

00:16:00
[sil.] 

00:16:10
STEVE ANDREAS And as you do that does it change the meaning of this message at all? And does it change your response? 

00:16:20
UNKNOWN There's a slight range and response. 

00:16:25
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, in which direction? To make a little better? 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN It's a little less intense. 

00:16:30
STEVE ANDREAS Less intense. You understand the message a little better before you just had a set of words, dire of words and an image of the person who was saying these words and also the larger context. Does that change the meaning of the words at all? 

00:16:50
UNKNOWN Hmm… 

00:16:50
STEVE ANDREAS Not really. 

00:16:50
UNKNOWN Hmm… 

00:16:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Now this person is speaking to you. I mentioned already that this person a certain limitations, certain biases, certain history, and certain genetics who knows what, out of which they're speaking this to you. I like you to review some of them as a background for understanding what they're saying. And then I also want you to do something else, I want you to imagine that this person who was here right now and you could talk to them just as you're talking to me and asked them to clarify their message. What else could they have? What could they have about their state, their understanding at this moment? Their difficulties at this moment or whatever else might be going on. And I don't need to know the answer. 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN Uh… I need to clarify the question. 

00:17:50
STEVE ANDREAS Good. Okay. 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN Are you asking me what am I know about them? 

00:17:55
STEVE ANDREAS Yes. 

00:18:00
UNKNOWN And what's driving the message or what's? 

00:18:05
STEVE ANDREAS Yes. Let me give you an example. Uh… one on I worked with umm… had her sister's voices in her head cheering out her and criticizing her all the time. When she had it in the faces in the larger context she realize that the, that her daughter her sisters are envious. She can tell that by the expression on the, on the sisters faces. And that their criticism and their put downs came out of their envy, they actually respected her a great deal and were feeling diminished by that and changed the whole meaning of the message. That's something one of many, many examples I can give you of how additional information can change the meaning. And when you change the meaning it can change the response. When she realized, they were envious suddenly the putdowns became meaningless or rather than a all different meaning. So as you know this person and their background, their strengths and weaknesses and so on. And as they think about the context that they're in does that change the meaning of the message at all? 

00:19:15
UNKNOWN Somewhat. 

00:19:20
STEVE ANDREAS So it changes it somewhat? 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN Somewhat. 

00:19:20
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. And then I ask you, to you imagine that this person is here in the room you could talk with them just as you can talk to me. And ask them to clarify their message. What did they not say that was going on? What did they not say about their feelings, their fears, their assumptions or whatever? 

00:19:40
[sil.] 

00:19:45
STEVE ANDREAS And again I don't need you to tell me answer I just look to you to try it out and then report back. 

00:19:55
[sil.] 

00:20:10
STEVE ANDREAS Can you tell me a little bit about what's going on now? I saw you nodding first and now you're in some feeling. You just need a grief with her some time, no rush. 

00:20:25
[sil.] 

00:20:45
STEVE ANDREAS Something very nice is going on maybe uncomfortable and I think it's really good. 

00:20:50
[sil.] 

00:21:15
STEVE ANDREAS Something change, can you tell me a little bit about it without saying too much content just as you get some clarification. 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN Oh, yes. 

00:21:25
STEVE ANDREAS And that changed the meaning? 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:21:25
STEVE ANDREAS You all right? 

00:21:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:21:30
STEVE ANDREAS Could you give me a general description of the feelings you're feeling just a little while ago and there still be feeling some of. Look like it might be some kind of compassion or something of that nature. Feeling sorry for the other person? 

00:21:45
[sil.] 

00:21:50
STEVE ANDREAS Or maybe something else entirely. 

00:21:55
[sil.] 

00:22:00
UNKNOWN That's so hard to speak. 

00:22:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:22:05
UNKNOWN Umm… it's feeling sad that the other person couldn't know me. 

00:22:10
STEVE ANDREAS They couldn't know you. They weren't capable of that. All right. That's important. People are limited. No matter how much we would like them to be on a certain waits, certain people. At least at certain times maybe they can learn to be different. And at certain times we're simply not capable of something else. 

00:22:35
[sil.] 

00:23:25
STEVE ANDREAS I like you to take another step, are you ready for that? 

00:23:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:23:30
STEVE ANDREAS Ask this person what their positive intent was in speaking to you. 

00:23:35
[sil.] 

00:23:40
STEVE ANDREAS What are they that they want from you? 

00:23:45
[sil.] 

00:23:50
UNKNOWN I don't uh… I'm not sure they wanted anything from me. 

00:23:55
STEVE ANDREAS I'm sorry. 

00:23:55
UNKNOWN I'm not sure they wanted anything from me. 

00:23:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:24:00
UNKNOWN I think they wanted something for themselves. 

00:24:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. So what was your positive intent for themselves. They might not have had any positive intent for you. They might have just needed to blow up steamer, express their frustration and who knows what. 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN To be important. To be seen as important as special. 

00:24:25
STEVE ANDREAS They needed to be important and special. 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:24:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. And it just happen to be in the neighborhood uh? 

00:24:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. Definitely neighbourhood. 

00:24:40
STEVE ANDREAS We're too close now. 

00:24:45
[sil.] 

00:24:50
STEVE ANDREAS Now if you think again of the voices that spoke to you originally. You know that are never be good enough or something like that. 

00:24:55
UNKNOWN I'll never be smart enough. 

00:25:00
STEVE ANDREAS Never be smart enough, alright. Never be smart enough. 

00:25:00
UNKNOWN That's the most often, you know… 

00:25:05
STEVE ANDREAS I'm sorry. 

00:25:05
UNKNOWN That's the voice the part that shows up often. 

00:25:10
STEVE ANDREAS All right and if it says that do you know, how do you feel? 

00:25:15
[sil.] 

00:25:20
UNKNOWN What do you know you're son of a bitch. 

00:25:20
STEVE ANDREAS What is it? 

00:25:25
UNKNOWN I said, what do you know you son of a bitch. 

00:25:30
STEVE ANDREAS Oh, okay. What do you know you son of a bitch. You have to behave your stack, oh, it's all right, thank you. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:55
STEVE ANDREAS So I wanna test again. Hear that voice inside now so you feel you'll be never be smart enough. 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah it hangs around. It likes to hang around. 

00:26:05
STEVE ANDREAS It likes to hang around. 

00:26:05
UNKNOWN Yes. It likes to hang around. 

00:26:05
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. But does it, does it bother you still? As we made quite a few shifts I want to know what more we might need to do. Because I'm greedy I want to go for all. 

00:26:25
UNKNOWN Oh, well umm… you know, if we were scaling this psych, you know, 1 to 10 and 10 was, you know, it shows up and it's they're strong and loud and frequent. It's probably more like around five, six. 

00:26:40
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:26:40
UNKNOWN It's gonna hang around, it's gonna show up, it's gonna wanna invite me and induce me into that. 

00:26:45
STEVE ANDREAS And you're making, you're making predictions. You all right? 

00:26:50
UNKNOWN I don't know umm… what? You, you… 

00:26:50
STEVE ANDREAS You say it's going to stick at around, it's going hang around. 

00:26:55
UNKNOWN Not really they definitely wants to… 

00:26:55
STEVE ANDREAS I just wanna know, I just wanna know something and I'm quite serious about this. 

00:27:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:27:00
STEVE ANDREAS Give me fortune telling license. 

00:27:05
UNKNOWN Now that would be interesting, wouldn't it? Hmm… no. 

00:27:10
STEVE ANDREAS I don't think you're qualified now to make predictions about the future. 

00:27:15
UNKNOWN A little bit hell that just goes to show you. I'll never be smarter. 

00:27:20
[sil.] 

00:27:30
UNKNOWN I'm sorry. 

00:27:30
STEVE ANDREAS I'm not. 

00:27:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:27:35
STEVE ANDREAS I'm cool. 

00:27:35
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:27:40
STEVE ANDREAS Now let's try that something, try to feel the thing, you hope for someone trying? 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN Oh, sure why not. You tell this much. 

00:27:45
STEVE ANDREAS As I like to get it down the way below five… 

00:27:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:27:50
STEVE ANDREAS …I think you would too, okay? 

00:27:50
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. 

00:27:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. One of you what is the voice slang to you now, is it changed at all? As it's telling you'll be smart enough? 

00:28:00
[sil.] 

00:28:05
UNKNOWN Well, it's kind of like if you really go to that place where you think you are smart enough or you gonna be that arrogant son of bitch. 

00:28:15
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. That will be the opposite, opposite then right? 

00:28:20
UNKNOWN Hmm… Well, it would be in, in, it was the word iteration of it, it would be uh… 

00:28:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Now this… 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN And I don't want to go there. I wanna be smart enough I don't wanna be arrogant. 

00:28:35
STEVE ANDREAS Really? Do you really think there's some danger in that? 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN Oh, God. I don't know I see enough more people who are arrogant but so I don't know. 

00:28:45
STEVE ANDREAS Oh, yeah. Now there's a huge deletion in this, in this sentence. 

00:28:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:28:50
STEVE ANDREAS Smart enough for what? Reason are enough to put your clothes on in the morning? 

00:29:00
UNKNOWN Well, I'd like to go a little bit beyond that. 

00:29:05
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, Well. That's fine with me. The question is, here, here's a situation though. When you have a voice like this that says, you'll never be smart enough. It does, it does all your fault or what? I'm not smart enough to be uh… what we call nuclear physicist. Or a greater degree in chemistry. Well, I'm, I'm not smart enough for that probably, I'm not smart enough for certain things, I'm not good enough for certain things. But I'm plenty good enough for other things. So the key thing is to fill in the blank with something and then you can find out if you're smart enough or not. And smart enough just means smart enough to do the job, doesn't mean smarter than anybody else just means far enough to do the job. Whatever you choose for the task. 

00:30:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:30:00
STEVE ANDREAS So just try it out in your mind a little bit just go quickly through, go through some context. While I'm smart enough for this I'm not smart enough or whatever. This is just self-knowledge, this isn't arrogance. Arrogance is I know everything there is past and present, future too. So you can get little arrogant when you're predicting the future just go while you know. 

00:30:20
UNKNOWN Oh, dear, stop. See, there you go. 

00:30:30
[sil.] 

00:30:35
UNKNOWN Am I supposed to talk to you? 

00:30:40
STEVE ANDREAS Till you give me a whole report what going on here. 

00:30:45
UNKNOWN Okay. Umm… well, I think that it's more like, you're never gonna be smart enough to be that respected Clinician whom… 

00:31:00
STEVE ANDREAS Which respected clinic clinician? 

00:31:05
UNKNOWN A any… 

00:31:05
STEVE ANDREAS You have some kind of idea? You've been trying to go for it. 

00:31:15
[sil.] 

00:31:20
UNKNOWN I must have. 

00:31:25
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Now I think ideals are wonderful as long as you never achieve them. 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN Well… 

00:31:30
STEVE ANDREAS Seriously I think the idea… 

00:31:35
UNKNOWN Thanks a lot. Okay, I'm sorry. 

00:31:35
STEVE ANDREAS I think the ideal is a wonderful as, as guides to what you want to accomplish to what you wanna do in life to how, how you wanna uh… exhibit your values and whatever's important to you. And heroes are wonderful examples of whatever it is that you would like to be can be inspiring, can set a direction and fully forward to be more from you can be, I think that's all fine, but not as a sure, that not as must and that's the difference I think. And I'd like to get across to you. 

00:32:20
[sil.] 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN Okay. Go for it. 

00:32:25
STEVE ANDREAS So what's going on now? I need a little help you back. 

00:32:35
UNKNOWN Umm… 

00:32:35
STEVE ANDREAS You struggle to tear up there for a while. 

00:32:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, I… 

00:32:35
STEVE ANDREAS Thinking about the never becoming the perfect clinician or whatever. 

00:32:40
UNKNOWN Oh, I don't think perfect. I think perfect would be uh… I don't go there. It's more. Can I be know little way… 

00:32:55
STEVE ANDREAS You know that 50% of men are memorized? 

00:33:00
UNKNOWN Do I give a shit? 

00:33:05
STEVE ANDREAS Unless you're a perfect assholes. 

00:33:05
UNKNOWN I've known a few. 

00:33:10
STEVE ANDREAS Me too. May not or may neither. 

00:33:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. This is true. 

00:33:15
STEVE ANDREAS So where are we now? 

00:33:20
UNKNOWN No, I, I think that, you know, what I would like to… achieve is to be known in a professional life as someone who is umm… skilled incompetent and, and a little, a little bit above the average, a little bit above average umm… 

00:33:45
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:33:45
UNKNOWN …not special but at least somewhat unique… 

00:33:50
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:33:50
UNKNOWN …and umm… or respected. 

00:33:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN For that uniqueness and for being… known and, and understood. 

00:34:05
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah, you want to be heard. You, all right? You always seem the way who you are. 

00:34:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:34:15
STEVE ANDREAS You all right? Great. I think that's wonderful. I don't know is fame and fortune is a way to get it. 

00:34:25
UNKNOWN I just wanna do it without scaring people. 

00:34:30
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:34:30
UNKNOWN I want to be powerful. Well, I don't want to instil fear. 

00:34:35
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. Can you think, can you think of… 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN I want to have wisdom but not arrogance. 

00:34:40
STEVE ANDREAS Got it. I know the one prevents the other. You know, we have wisdom you don't have to worry about arrogance 'cause wisdom keeps things in perspective. Arrogance loses perspective completely. 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN But maybe since I consider it I'm more on the wisdom side I'm hoping. 

00:35:00
STEVE ANDREAS I think so. So think of a situation where you'd like to be seen by some particular person. And you think you scare them. That's what's you concerned about right? You want to be seen but you don't want to scare people. It's all right? 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN Yes. But I don't know if there's a particular person. 

00:35:25
STEVE ANDREAS Well, pick one. 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN Okay, How about you? 

00:35:30
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN I don't know you but that's okay. 

00:35:35
STEVE ANDREAS Well, am I seeing him? 

00:35:40
UNKNOWN Umm… superficially yes. 

00:35:40
STEVE ANDREAS Well… 

00:35:40
UNKNOWN Yes, I mean we just met. 

00:35:40
STEVE ANDREAS Yes, of course. 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:35:45
STEVE ANDREAS To the degree that we're directing. 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:35:45
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. Do you wanna experiment? 

00:35:45
UNKNOWN Do you, do you look scared? 

00:35:50
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN Umm… not yet. 

00:35:55
STEVE ANDREAS Would you like to try and scare me? 

00:36:00
UNKNOWN I'm not, I don't, I don't know, I don't want to scare you. 

00:36:05
STEVE ANDREAS Well, here's the thing you, you were concerned that you wanted to be seen for who you are. 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:36:10
STEVE ANDREAS And to the limited extent that we've had an interaction here I think I'm seeing you. 

00:36:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:36:15
STEVE ANDREAS Now you also said that you wanted to do that without scaring other people to show your strength and not to scare other people. Right? 

00:36:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:36:25
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Well, I'm here and I'm not scared yet. So is there something you could tell me about yourself? Because I'm going to get to know you better than you think might scare me. Trying to go for the worst catastrophic (inaudible ), catastrophic expectations. 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN I know you want me to scare you with something about myself. 

00:36:45
STEVE ANDREAS No, I want you to tell me something about yourself you're worried might scare me. 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN That I'm worried might scary you? 

00:36:50
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. Some what little bit different, slightly different to this one. 

00:37:00
UNKNOWN You okay, let's say it. I have to think about it because I don't know what it is that scares people. But I get that kind of feedback sometimes. 

00:37:10
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Think of the time when you got that feedback. Tell me a little bit about what people, what, what about you scared someone else? 

00:37:25
UNKNOWN I guess I've gotten to a point in life where I am not inclined to invest myself in uh… relationships with other people when I find them quite superficial. 

00:37:45
STEVE ANDREAS Right. Me too. 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN And so I'm telling you about it when I've gotten feedback. I may not scare you with it but umm… and so I tend to kind of be that person in that circumstance who is more likely to say well, that's very nice, it's so nice to me and so I wanna this way. 

00:38:10
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. It went away. Yeah. Well, that's one way go about it. Can you think of others? I mean one way would be to take the superficial situation and make it deeper. Have some something really important what's really important to you what, what do whistle out, what blows you dress up? 

00:38:35
UNKNOWN Umm… 

00:38:35
STEVE ANDREAS I'm just posing it as an alternative possibility. 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN Yes. Well, I can do that. 

00:38:40
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN I don't choose to. 

00:38:45
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:38:45
UNKNOWN Umm… 

00:38:45
STEVE ANDREAS But if you do it? 

00:38:50
UNKNOWN Umm… sometimes I mean I have done that. 

00:38:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:38:55
UNKNOWN And, and sometimes it's… you know, you get a little gem and other times you get a polish shit. 

00:39:00
STEVE ANDREAS Right. 

00:39:05
UNKNOWN So, uh… 

00:39:05
STEVE ANDREAS Right. The world doesn't always cooperate. 

00:39:10
UNKNOWN No. And so umm… I've, I've been kind of given the feedback that that I'm that I scare people with, with, you know, kind of not being as attentive or not being as engaged or being more, being too aloofer. 

00:39:30
STEVE ANDREAS Well. You talk about the word scare but this doesn't strike me as scary. If you're aloof is that scary to other people or do they just not like it? 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN I'm not sure. 

00:39:40
STEVE ANDREAS You're not. Pick one of these people which said you were aloof and scary. Close your eyes, go and ask them, "What's going on here. What about me put you off or do you not like or whatever. Can you describe it and clarify this more for me?" See there could be some useful feedback here. Sometimes voices have useful information for you. 

00:40:10
[sil.] 

00:40:15
STEVE ANDREAS You put your nose in the air for instance. Ask this person what was, what was it, if there was a problem. Did you feel insulted, did you feel cut off, did you feel whatever? 

00:40:30
[sil.] 

00:40:40
UNKNOWN That when that, when that happens that I am that that's turn them out to being arrogant. 

00:40:50
STEVE ANDREAS You didn't turn out to be arrogant? 

00:40:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, I did. I guess so. 

00:40:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, all right. I know this is something you don't wanna do, right? 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN No. 

00:41:00
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, close your eyes. 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:41:00
STEVE ANDREAS Talk to this person until and, you know, I was there again. What can I do or what could I do to make amends? I screwed up, I messed up that's what our kids used to say. I messed up unlike that it has love less hooks and that than you did wrong and you did bad later or something like that. I messed up. 

00:41:35
[sil.] 

00:41:40
STEVE ANDREAS Make peace with that person. Hey, I'm sorry I did that. And probably you could say something like I was acting out of my own fear of my own discomfort of not knowing what to do in the situation. And so I was stronger than I meant to be was more emphatic that I meant to be here when I wanted to be. Or something… that fit for you. 

00:42:10
[sil.] 

00:42:20
UNKNOWN I don't wanna lose my strength. 

00:42:20
STEVE ANDREAS No, absolutely not. True strength is gentle. It's only false strength it is violent and hard and brutal, and damaging. 

00:42:40
[sil.] 

00:42:45
UNKNOWN I think, I, I should get there. 

00:42:50
STEVE ANDREAS Hmm? 

00:42:50
UNKNOWN I said, I don't know if I should go there. 

00:42:55
STEVE ANDREAS You don't wanna go somewhere? 

00:42:55
UNKNOWN No, well, I didn't know I shouldn't, you know, maybe I shouldn't. I shouldn't go there. I… 

00:43:00
STEVE ANDREAS But give me a little report how are things now? 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN Uh… 

00:43:00
STEVE ANDREAS What's going on? 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN Okay, it's okay. 

00:43:10
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Let's go back to the original sense, I'll never be smart enough. 

00:43:10
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:43:15
STEVE ANDREAS Hear that sentence, does it sound the same as it used to? 

00:43:20
UNKNOWN Hmm… it's, no. 

00:43:20
STEVE ANDREAS Does it still going to make you uncomfortable? But last time we checked and it was a five I think down for a nine or something. 

00:43:30
UNKNOWN It's, it's less, it's less and… 

00:43:35
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, more give it a number. 

00:43:35
UNKNOWN Hmm… maybe two or three. 

00:43:40
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, maybe a three. 

00:43:40
UNKNOWN Hmm… maybe a three. 

00:43:40
STEVE ANDREAS That means it's on a two side of three or four side of three. 

00:43:45
UNKNOWN Well, let's just go with three. 

00:43:45
STEVE ANDREAS Just go with three. Okay. Let's try a few other little things and some of these may not be appropriate. I, I should have mentioned right at the beginning that, my way of working is to offer you a lot of understandings and a lot of instructions mostly process instructions and from which you to pick and choose. I like to say I'm a expert on what might work and you're the expert on what does work. I think that's called co-creating or something like that. So if listen to that voice you'll never be smart enough is it you now or I? Because when we added the interaction with that person it turned into a view. Right? So now it's you'll never be smart enough. 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN I'm a little confused. 

00:44:40
STEVE ANDREAS Hmm? 

00:44:45
UNKNOWN I'm a little confused maybe that's a good think. Confusion is always helpful. 

00:44:45
STEVE ANDREAS Okay, on in all. Okay. As you hear that voice now is it that say I were you? Does it say I'll never be smart enough or does it say you'll never be smart enough? 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN Oh, Well, you know, I think you're gonna wanna know the answer it's both end. 

00:45:05
STEVE ANDREAS Both end? I suggest you make it into you because it's clear that it's somebody else's opinion not your own. 

00:45:15
UNKNOWN Okay. I'm trying it down. 

00:45:20
STEVE ANDREAS We don't pop out of our mother's belly's talking and using words. Those are all things that we learnt from other people. And little babies never worry about being smart enough. (inaudible ). 

00:45:40
[sil.] 

00:45:45
STEVE ANDREAS What's going on now? 

00:45:50
[sil.] 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN Well. I got to this place of this message being embedded in, in patriarchy. Essentially that as a woman I have to be careful. 

00:46:15
STEVE ANDREAS All right. So who's saying this to you now? 

00:46:20
UNKNOWN It's a generalized kind of societal patriarchal influence. 

00:46:25
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. Okay, well, pick one particular person. 

00:46:30
UNKNOWN Okay. I'll go with uh… 

00:46:30
STEVE ANDREAS The Donald, Donald, Donald Trump or somebody like that. 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN That would work. 

00:46:35
STEVE ANDREAS C'mon he doesn't mind. 

00:46:40
[sil.] 

00:46:45
STEVE ANDREAS So if you hear Donald Trump saying this to you. 

00:46:50
UNKNOWN Be careful you're a woman. You don't wanna let your, you don't wanna let your power escape. Get it I'll put it out there it might scare somebody to death. 

00:47:00
STEVE ANDREAS All right. I want to you notice something. That voice is presupposing that you have power. 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:47:05
STEVE ANDREAS So you got the power. 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:47:10
STEVE ANDREAS It's just a matter of expressing it. Preferably for a boy in the way he doesn't make too much way. 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN Then I, yeah… 

00:47:15
STEVE ANDREAS That's useful to you at little extent. 

00:47:20
UNKNOWN Well, I'd like it to be of use to be and valuable context and… 

00:47:25
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:47:25
UNKNOWN …not terrifying the other people. 

00:47:30
STEVE ANDREAS All right. 

00:47:30
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:47:30
STEVE ANDREAS Well, the terrifying to other people who's come back who will be terrified by this? 

00:47:40
[sil.] 

00:47:50
STEVE ANDREAS I'm not terrified by it. 

00:47:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. Umm… most likely anyone who has, you know, who's, who's doesn't feel sure of themselves who is insecure about themselves who is… 

00:48:10
STEVE ANDREAS Really 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN …feels unsafe about who they are. 

00:48:15
STEVE ANDREAS Right. Got you, I agree with you completely. Pick somebody specifically you know, I'll die a lot with. 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:48:25
STEVE ANDREAS Because I wanna, I wanna make you bullet proof. I'd like to have you, have competencies so that you can express yourself fully and strongly in a way that maybe it doesn't put down the other person, doesn't destroy the other person's ego and because that gets messy. That gets wild, that gets weird kind of warms. 'Cause somehow to us… 

00:48:50
UNKNOWN Can I ask you a question? 

00:48:50
STEVE ANDREAS Sure, sure. 

00:48:55
UNKNOWN Uh… when I get, when I bring this whole question of patriarchy into that it's as if I'm sort of umm… oppressed by that in terms of expressing in a way that's a natural. 

00:49:10
STEVE ANDREAS Right. And that's what I'm trying to work with you. So pick a patriarch. 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN Okay. I'm sorry. 

00:49:15
STEVE ANDREAS Pick a patriarch. 

00:49:15
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:49:20
STEVE ANDREAS And picture that person in a particular context. How can you express your strength? And invite your unconscious mind to participate fully in the search. How can you express your strength in a way that's quiet and not demeaning? Because that's our natural tendency, is to put down somebody who puts you down. That works for both males and females as far as I know little kids too. How could you express your strength in a way that doesn't challenge that insecure person's… situation? And we might have to send you and do some homework and send you on a search for this. Do you understand the principle? 

00:50:10
UNKNOWN I understand the principle. 

00:50:10
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN I don't think it's an, I think it's an old struggle. 

00:50:15
STEVE ANDREAS Sure. 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN I think it's a, it's a, umm… it's a conflict of, of how do I be fully human… 

00:50:30
STEVE ANDREAS Right. 

00:50:35
UNKNOWN …in my female body? They can say, you know, you're fully shit. 

00:50:45
[sil.] 

00:50:50
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Now how can you acknowledge the humanity of the other person of the same time? Well, that's gonna be the clue. If you say you're full of shit, that's going to stir up a whole bunch of… you know that right? 

00:51:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:51:00
STEVE ANDREAS That's for war thing, that's the conflict in the war. How could you say that would acknowledge maybe uh… nonverbally or covertly acknowledge his insecurity? One way is to talk about your own insecurities. And that can be an invitation for the other person to admit and mention there is. I don't know there's lots and lots of, this is basically skill building at this point, do you understand? 

00:51:35
UNKNOWN I can say, you know, it's really difficult for me… 

00:51:45
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:51:45
UNKNOWN …to say with strength and power… 

00:51:50
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:51:50
UNKNOWN …that I disagree with you. Then I think you don't see me… 

00:51:55
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:51:55
UNKNOWN …you don't hear me. 

00:52:00
STEVE ANDREAS Right. Who do you need to say this to you? Who in your past you need to say this to you? This sounds like a very old one. Your papa or grandfather, minister or something? 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN You're making the list. That's the list. 

00:52:20
STEVE ANDREAS Multiple, multiples uh? 

00:52:20
UNKNOWN Yes, the list, the list is long. 

00:52:20
STEVE ANDREAS That's called multiple personality. 

00:52:25
UNKNOWN Pardon? 

00:52:25
STEVE ANDREAS That's called multiple personality. I'm trying to make a joke. 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN Oh, well, I hope so because I'm like, God know I don't think so. 

00:52:35
STEVE ANDREAS It so, it's so flat, it's so flat. So, please excuse me. 

00:52:40
UNKNOWN No the list is… 

00:52:40
STEVE ANDREAS I'll never be perfect in it. 

00:52:45
UNKNOWN Uh… I don't, I, I don't that's, I'm that's okay. We don't need to be umm… 

00:52:50
STEVE ANDREAS Let me, let me just outline with it. We're, we're going to run out of time a little early soon. 

00:52:55
UNKNOWN Yes. Andreas, thank you. 

00:52:55
STEVE ANDREAS I wanna outline some homework. 

00:52:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:53:00
STEVE ANDREAS Study particularly powerful and like Virginia Satir. 

00:53:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:53:05
STEVE ANDREAS Or any other first powerful woman you know who models hence demonstrates the skills that you want. 

00:53:10
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:53:10
STEVE ANDREAS Of being able to assert yourself in a way that doesn't demean other people… 

00:53:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:53:15
STEVE ANDREAS …because that one just leads you in trouble. 

00:53:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:53:20
STEVE ANDREAS And one of the things Virginia Satir was very clear about is acknowledging your own power in your own strength and she was a very powerful woman. 

00:53:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:53:25
STEVE ANDREAS You've ever seen any of her moment? 

00:53:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:53:30
STEVE ANDREAS Well, at the same time acknowledging other people and their vulnerabilities and their power and know well who they are as a person. Now that suppose to be really seen you need to be really see others in the same way that you want to be seen. And that means getting fastest thing about and there will be smart enough involved so. I'm gonna just try a couple more things that I think might be useful. But that's the homework, okay? 

00:53:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:54:00
STEVE ANDREAS And we don't have time for all that here. 

00:54:00
UNKNOWN Umm… no, sure. Okay. 

00:54:05
STEVE ANDREAS Listen to that voice again who would you started with I'll never be smart enough. 

00:54:05
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:54:05
STEVE ANDREAS What is it like him? What is it like now to hear it? Now you'll never be smart we changed it. 

00:54:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:54:15
STEVE ANDREAS I hope. 

00:54:20
UNKNOWN Umm… it's umm… not as relevant. 

00:54:25
STEVE ANDREAS I'm sorry. 

00:54:25
UNKNOWN It doesn't have the relevance as much relevance. 

00:54:25
STEVE ANDREAS Give me the numbers since you like scaling(ph). 

00:54:30
UNKNOWN I'll give you. Well, it's just easier. Umm… you know go with, with two. 

00:54:35
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Now through the same voice you're not smart enough hear it in some foreign accent. Can you do that? 

00:54:50
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. 

00:54:50
STEVE ANDREAS Does that change your response to it at all? 

00:54:55
UNKNOWN Umm… sorry no. 

00:54:55
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. Right, no, that's all right, some things work and some things don't for different people. Okay. Here's another way to go. Think of some kind of inspiring music that would support you in your goal of being yourself and showing your strengths while acknowledging other people strengths and weak, weaknesses as well. You have some favorite piece of music that is uplifting or inspiring in someway. 

00:55:25
UNKNOWN I do, I don't know the name of it but I know. 

00:55:25
STEVE ANDREAS That's all right. Can you hear it? I mean, I mean to know what it is. 

00:55:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, it's sort of Spanish dance. 

00:55:30
STEVE ANDREAS Great. Okay. Now I want you to close your eyes and hear those voices says you'll never be smart enough. And the background you have this music playing. 

00:55:45
UNKNOWN That worked. 

00:55:45
STEVE ANDREAS Say them together. 

00:55:50
UNKNOWN That works. 

00:55:50
STEVE ANDREAS I can, I can feel that works. 

00:55:55
STEVE ANDREAS So now here's something you can do, you know, and maybe install and consciously already. But if it's not you can do consciously anytime the voice comes and you can hear that music whatever it is. 

00:56:05
UNKNOWN Mm-hmm. Thanks. 

00:56:05
STEVE ANDREAS And all that can way, way, different. 

00:56:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah, that's excellent. That's helpful I like a lot. 

00:56:10
STEVE ANDREAS You know I have a couple of minutes more. Do you have any questions about what we've done here? Take a deep breath. 

00:56:20
UNKNOWN I'm not smart enough forever. I don't have any questions now I was just teasing you. 

00:56:25
STEVE ANDREAS Great. I love it. 

00:56:30
UNKNOWN Umm… I don't think of any questions at, at this moment. 

00:56:30
STEVE ANDREAS As I… 

00:56:35
UNKNOWN I don't think of any questions at this moment but I'm sure they will bubble up. 

00:56:35
STEVE ANDREAS Okay. 

00:56:35
UNKNOWN Shall I, shall I write you? 

00:56:40
STEVE ANDREAS Yeah. 

00:56:40
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:56:40
STEVE ANDREAS Actually I'll ask you at the end to give me your email and your phone number so that I can check up on your point. 

00:56:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:56:50
STEVE ANDREAS I find that some people are less in diligent about checking up with me. 

00:56:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:56:55
STEVE ANDREAS But I will do it. 

00:56:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:56:55
STEVE ANDREAS We perhaps have a time for one or more questions, one or two maybe or maybe we just end here? I don't see any questions. Thank you for your attention oh, we've got one more over there. 

00:57:15
UNKNOWN Does voice inside your head that's critical that you're talking about almost always tuning into the external voice, somewhere? 

00:57:20
STEVE ANDREAS Yes. 

00:57:20
UNKNOWN I can see it's always go back to that to bring up the connection. 

00:57:25
STEVE ANDREAS I assume, I assume that the any voice of his internalized as something that has been borrowed from somebody else or that its language that sometimes it's a personal has been made a conclusion. I worked with one woman who uh… had a voice that says you're not good enough much similar to yours. And her mother never said that to her but she always kept telling, telling her how she could improve what she did. And so our conclusion from hearing the mother's voice was it she was not good enough. So there are, there are variations on this but we don't pop into the world with voices we don't pop into the world with language. We learn that from other people sometimes it's very useful and uh… you, you all have voices that help you make decisions on what to do. You all have positive voices and then there's also the negative ones. And some people try to get rid of the negative ones but I got news for you if you get rid of those you get rid of them all at once and it's not good. So what you need to do is educate the voice. And learn more about it clarify the relationship by, by having this face to face kind of con, conversation. Learn more about it where Virginia Satir used to say, "Peace comes from understanding not agreement." 

00:58:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:58:40
STEVE ANDREAS I like that to be blazoned on the universe. Piece comes from understanding not agreement. 

00:58:45
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:58:45
STEVE ANDREAS In this whole process we're going through, we're going through here, this help her understand different parts of herself that are expressed as an internal voice and song, images that come up on the feelings and stuff that are resulting from that. So I think that's a good voice to stop. Thank you all for your time. 

00:59:05
UNKNOWN Thank you. Thank you. 

00:59:10
STEVE ANDREAS Thank you very much.
