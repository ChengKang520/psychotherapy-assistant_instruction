DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  In this next film, a session is recorded between a woman, her two sons, and a family therapist. This was a first interview. There had been no prior discussion about whether or not there would be follow-up sessions. Here is a part of the interview and segments from the Mutual Recall of family and therapist. 

00:01:05
Interview: Family 1 

00:01:05
COUNSELOR  Will you make of what your mom saying? 

00:01:15
SCOTT (inaudible ). 

00:01:20
COUNSELOR Hmm. Is that how it is? Was you described that? 

00:01:25
MIKE Yeah. Like if we wanted to go with our dad. She, we were gonna go on the day we were going with our dad. We'd say no because we wanna go with our dad instead of her. 

00:01:35
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. Ah, I wonder if sometimes you feel in between your mom and your dad do you ever feel like you're in the middle between them. 

00:01:45
SCOTT Uh hmm, hmm. 

00:01:45
MIKE Yeah. 

00:01:45
COUNSELOR You both feel that. Can you talk about that some more? 

00:01:50
SCOTT  You know, sometimes there are stuff I wanna do, better with my dad because he is a boy and we are, and other thing is 'coz my mom is a lady. 

00:02:05
 Hmm, sometimes you just wanna be with a man instead of a, instead of a woman huh, 'coz you are man or, or you're gonna be a man at someday. 

00:02:15
[sil.] 

00:02:15
COUNSELOR  How about you Mike? 

00:02:20
MIKE I feel the same way. 

00:02:20
 Uh hmm. Sometimes you just wanna be with your dad coz he's a guy. Uh hmm. 

00:02:25
BETTY  Your dad has lot of new things to do(ph). 

00:02:30
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. Let me ask you a question. You told me a few months ago that, ah, you separate in January. 

00:02:40
BETTY Uh hmm. 

00:02:40
COUNSELOR And, ah, time has usually go for a lot of changes when something like that happens. And, and what was the process like an obvious certain time(ph) adopt that and get use to that without dad being at home? Can you talk about that so? What was that like for all of you to have dad move out? 

00:03:00
SCOTT  Oh, I just got out of order. 

00:03:05
MIKE We could go to bed when we wanted... (crosstalk) 

00:03:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:03:10
MIKE ...on a certain time. 

00:03:10
  Uh-huh. 

00:03:15
COUNSELOR It sounds like things were confusing during that period and I guess mom had a lot of feelings and must have been upset and so you two got your own way quite a bit, you could do whatever you wanted. How is it for you Betty(ph) during that time? 

00:03:30
BETTY  Okay, uhm, usually, I'm not a disciplinarian uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:03:40
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:03:40
BETTY Jerry always say, you know, in fact, we kind of worked contrary to each other and that I tried... (crosstalk) 

00:03:45
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:03:45
BETTY ...to compensate for his strictness by being more lenient. 

00:03:50
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:03:50
BETTY Uhm, I've usually found that the boys are fairly level headed kids and I could always trust their decisions and, you know, and their, uhm, okay, it's just like on going to bed, they usually know when they're tired... (crosstalk) 

00:04:05
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:04:05
BETTY ...they usually go to bed on their own, uhm. 

00:04:05
COUNSELOR Well, I hear one of the, one of the shifts you had to make was kind of taking over for part of Jerry's role that is you hadn't become more... (crosstalk) 

00:04:15
BETTY Hmm. 

00:04:15
COUNSELOR ...of a disciplinarian... (crosstalk) 

00:04:15
BETTY Uh hmm. 

00:04:15
COUNSELOR ...exert some more influenced. 

00:04:15
 Hmm. 

00:04:15
COUNSELOR  Is that accurate or not? 

00:04:20
BETTY Yeah, it is. And I'm, I'm just kind of like thinking what did I, you know, what changes did I actually make myself that I'm not even aware of... (crosstalk) 

00:04:30
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:04:30
BETTY ...that I made, uhm. 

00:04:35
[sil.] 

00:04:35
BETTY  Okay, I think what I tried to do was set down a few limits and not make it, not make too many things if they couldn't do. I don't put too many "no's" up but put up enough for their own safety. 

00:04:50
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:04:50
BETTY  Uhm, and I really feel that they're responsible young boys, uhm. 

00:05:00
COUNSELOR  Hmm, you, you look at, at Scott(ph). What? (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
BETTY Yeah, I guess I'm looking for a reaction to see if they thought that I was too lenient. This is the first time I've heard that. 

00:05:15
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:05:15
BETTY Uhm, what I usually hear from you guys is "Me no mom." 

00:05:15
MIKE  Did I? 

00:05:20
BETTY Oh, you didn't really actually say that in words but a lot of times I picked up from what, you know, what I say to you and things that you don't always agree with what I think or saying. 

00:05:35
[sil.] 

00:05:35
COUNSELOR  Is there a hard time to think about, to talk about that period when your mom and dad first got divorced or when dad first move out of the house. Is it hard to think about that, painful. That is for you Mike(ph) and for you too Scott(ph). 

00:05:55
BETTY  Okay, and for me it was more of relief. 

00:06:00
COUNSELOR Uh hmm, it was more for a relief. 

00:06:00
BETTY Relief, right. Uhm, I felt that there was no quite attention in the house prior to his leaving. Uhm, it was almost like, "okay, Betty(ph) you can, you know, do it your way now." Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:06:15
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:06:15
BETTY I always felt like I had, ah, that I was very restricted by all, the pressures that he put on us. Uhm, the boys... (crosstalk) 

00:06:20
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:06:20
BETTY ...weren't allowed to have friends and, and make a noise, uhm, and it was just nice to be able to do things that we wanted to do. 

00:06:30
 Uh hmm. It sounds like, ah, that you and the boys had very different reactions to that. There is was... (crosstalk) 

00:06:35
BETTY Uh hmm. 

00:06:35
COUNSELOR ...one of sort of grief and lost. And yours was one of relief. 

00:06:40
BETTY Uh hmm. 

00:06:40
 Why is that may it hard for, that a communicate with each other about that since you has such a different feelings? Did you get a chance to talk about that with each other by yourself about mom and dad, ah, separating in? Did you ever talk with your parents about that? 

00:06:55
MIKE  Sometimes. 

00:07:00
BETTY Uh hmm. Uhm, I think both their father and both the boys were very against my decision, (crosstalk) 

00:07:10
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:07:10
BETTY you know, to get to divorce. 

00:07:10
COUNSELOR Hmm. I'd like to hear from the guys about it... (crosstalk) 

00:07:10
BETTY Okay. 

00:07:10
COUNSELOR ...a little bit more. Can you talk about that some more? I think it might help. 

00:07:15
MIKE  No, mom. 

00:07:20
BETTY Okay. What did you feel about mom and dad getting a divorced? 

00:07:25
MIKE What did I feel... (crosstalk) 

00:07:25
BETTY Uh-huh. 

00:07:25
MIKE ...about it? 

00:07:35
[sil.] 

00:07:35
SCOTT  Yeah, I don't know. I can't put it in words. 

00:07:40
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:07:40
SCOTT  I have it here in my mind but I can't put it in, in words. 

00:07:50
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:07:50
BETTY  Can I help if I gave you words? You tell me if they were right or wrong. We're you mad, hurt. (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
COUNSELOR Hurt. I think Scott(ph) must to find his own words. 

00:08:00
BETTY  Okay. 

00:08:05
MIKE I will say it. 

00:08:05
[sil.] 

00:08:05
MIKE  And I think I know one of the reasons why you gonna divorce is that, that you and dad went to different churches. 

00:08:20
BETTY Uh hmm. 

00:08:20
COUNSELOR  Uh hmm. And so I guess part of the process of understanding was trying to find reasons why that happened. And one of the reasons was that mom and dad went to different churches. Uh hmm. 

00:08:40
[sil.] 

00:08:40
COUNSELOR  Did you try to understand why that happened to you? 

00:08:45
SCOTT  No, I really didn't do long very good. 

00:08:50
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:08:50
SCOTT They did, hmm, we go each other then. 

00:08:55
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:09:00
[sil.] 

00:09:00
COUNSELOR  Do you have some feelings you'd like to express to your mom about her decision to divorce such you haven't have a chance to talk? 

00:09:20
SCOTT Yeah, uh hmm. 

00:09:20
COUNSELOR  Mike(ph) says he does, what would you like to say to her? Go ahead. 

00:09:25
MIKE Uhm, I've already. 

00:09:25
BETTY  Tell me children. 

00:09:30
MIKE Well, I was mad at you... (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
BETTY Hmm. 

00:09:35
MIKE ...that you got it. And I thought you'd never gonna, gonna divorce but you did. 

00:09:45
[sil.] 

00:09:45
COUNSELOR Okay. I think maybe it would be useful if you could explain to them why. 

00:09:50
BETTY  Okay. I think that they've said a lot of the, the things that, you know, really was, is that Jerry and I really disagreed on a lot of things and the religious factor was really, really important. And there were so many times that I wanted to talk to your dad and he would never listen to me and he'd never see my side. And it's kind of important to be able to, you know, to let the other person know how you feel and have them respect what you think. 

00:10:30
[sil.] 

00:10:30
BETTY  And I guess there's a lot of, you know, kind of other things that, uhm, that were very hard for me because I really like your dad and I realize that we couldn't get along together. And so sometimes even though you care about people that it's better that you don't live together. And I think, I guess from what I see, I see both of us as being a little bit happier than what we used to be. You know, I see your dad as being a lot happier and I, I feel that I'm a lot happier. Do you see the same thing? 

00:11:15
COUNSELOR  Hmm, I'll talk about those. 

00:11:25
SCOTT No, there isn't a lot of things that, uhm, that we don't like (inaudible ) I don't like some of the things that my mom and dad, and some, some of the things (inaudible ). 

00:11:39
COUNSELOR Uh-huh. You don't like some of those things. 

00:11:40
SCOTT Uh hmm. 

00:11:40
 Ah, maybe you are to tell us what they are so we could know... (crosstalk) 

00:11:45
SCOTT I don't know. (crosstalk) 

00:11:45
COUNSELOR and understand what feeling. 

00:11:45
SCOTT Were going shopping with stuff(ph) to, with dad going to city. 

00:11:50
COUNSELOR Uh-huh. 

00:11:55
[sil.] 

00:11:55
BETTY  So those are things you're mad for me? 

00:12:00
SCOTT Right. 

00:12:00
MIKE My dad wasn't happy living where he is right now. 

00:12:05
SCOTT You just get often then your(ph) always fight (inaudible ). 

00:12:11
COUNSELOR Why don't you do that? 

00:12:11
SCOTT 'Coz my girlfriend going really(ph) to strike to. 

00:12:11
COUNSELOR  Yes I'd love too. Hmm. 

00:12:15
[sil.] 

00:12:15
COUNSELOR  Well then, you know, I think, ah, that the three of you need to sit and talk about this some more(ph) and find out what each others feeling about it still. Scott(ph) seems to have a lot of feelings about that, hmm. I'm sure both of you do too. 

00:12:40
BETTY Okay, and I think one of the things that I've been telling Scott(ph) is I asked him, you know, an awful a lot to tell me, you know, how he feels and what he feels. And you don't always tell me Scott(ph). 

00:12:50
Mutual Recall Session: Family 1 

00:12:50
COUNSELOR  How do your kids, ah, feel about that? Will you make of what your mom is saying? 

00:13:05
SCOTT  We love her(ph) much. 

00:13:10
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. Is that how it is? Was you described that? 

00:13:15
MIKE Yeah. Like if we wanted to go with our dad. She, we were gonna go on the day, we were going with our dad. We'd say no because we wanna go with our dad instead of her. 

00:13:30
COUNSELOR Uh-huh. I wonder sometimes if feeling in between your mom and your dad, did you ever feel like you're in the middle between them? 

00:13:35
SCOTT Hmm, hmm. 

00:13:35
MIKE Yeah. 

00:13:35
  You both feel that. Can you talk about that some more? 

00:13:45
SCOTT You know, sometimes there are stuff I wanna do, better with my dad because he is a boy and we are, and other thing is coz my mom is a lady. 

00:13:55
COUNSELOR I had a lot of feelings about this whole sequence. And it started with, ah, just before we went on camera that he mentioned that she had, ah, divorced in January. And I took that as sort of a readiness to talk about that if you brought that up on your own (inaudible ). I thought maybe in need or some wanting to talk about that. (inaudible ) I know that, that's ah, a very painful thing for most families to go through. And I thought well, I need to talk about it but, ah, no, we have time to really talk about. We will have time together to explore, the way it might need to be explored. And so I brought that question up about, ah, being in the middle 'coz Mike's(ph) said something that indicated that. With a lot of ambivalence inside of me. And I don't know if I'm glad I do that in a. 

00:15:00
  And that's talking about when you look something and kind of wondering whether or not it should of(ph). What, what could the three of you feel about that? 

00:15:15
BETTY Okay, if someone would, would have asked me what we probably would have talked about, would have probably let the same kind of things, (crosstalk) 

00:15:25
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:15:25
BETTY ...you know, uhm. 

00:15:25
COUNSELOR So that was an agenda for you, for you to talk about that. 

00:15:30
BETTY And I think the boys had in their agenda too. (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
COUNSELOR Did work? 

00:15:30
BETTY Uhm. 

00:15:30
SCOTT  Well, I just got out of order. 

00:15:35
MIKE  We could go to bed when we wanted... (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
MIKE ...on a certain time. 

00:15:45
 Uh-huh. 

00:15:45
 It sounds like those were confusing during that period and I guess mom had a lot of feelings and must had been upset and so you two got your own way quite a bit, you could do whatever you wanted. What's for oyu Betty(ph)? 

00:16:00
BETTY Okay, uhm, I think I've felt on the spot when you said that I gave them their own way. I didn't feel like that was an accurate thing. 

00:16:10
COUNSELOR Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
BETTY  And I guess I kinda take people that give their own way as, (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
COUNSELOR So. 

00:16:15
BETTY ...and not go and I felt that I had to defend my position. 

00:16:20
COUNSELOR (inaudible ). 

00:16:23
BETTY A little. Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
COUNSELOR Yeah. 

00:16:25
 Can you recall how you felt when you're saying (inaudible ) spot, uhm, (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
BETTY Yeah, usually, I don't always feel like I have to defend, you know, what I said. But I didn't know if you, I didn't know if you were getting there a (inaudible ) me as I am or how I see myself as and I get the one who's right me now. 

00:16:45
COUNSELOR That's as a go, ah, the picture I have was like, ah, that you're probably very upset when that happened and so probably you don't have it together (inaudible )... (crosstalk) 

00:16:56
BETTY Uh hmm. 

00:16:56
COUNSELOR ...and that is, ah, and now it's, it's difficult for me they're now(ph) expecting. So. (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:17:00
 But I felt, ah, I was talking too much and not, and not letting you give me the information as making assumptions maybe that I should have been making instead shou, maybe should ask that, there's a question. How was it confusing? (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
BETTY Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
COUNSELOR  And waited for you to tell me rather. 

00:17:20
BETTY Yeah, I guess I didn't see... (crosstalk) 

00:17:20
COUNSELOR So. 

00:17:20
BETTY ...this confusing but they did, (crosstalk) 

00:17:25
COUNSELOR Uh-huh. 

00:17:25
BETTY ...that I didn't know. 

00:17:25
MIKE  I was thinking that we're not spoiled or anything that's just, ah, there was no certain time because when my dad was living with us, no, we go to bed at 9 or 9:30 but when he wasn't there, we just wouldn't go to bed 9 or 9:30. 

00:17:50
 Did you try to understand why that happened to you? 

00:17:55
SCOTT Oh, we really didn't do long very good. We didn't, we go to each other then. 

00:18:05
COUNSELOR Uh-huh. 

00:18:10
[sil.] 

00:18:10
BETTY Although I(ph) can stop you I guess what I'm feeling is kinda like uncomfortable right now because I, there's a lot of things that I like to say to you right now, Scott(ph), and I don't know if you want me to, you know, I don't know if we can handle that right now because I know what I'm gonna say that I was, that was like the only indication that you gave me that you had any understanding of why I did it. I always felt up until that time. You thought there was no reason for it and that we could, you know, make the most of that, you know, living together and I guess in a way, I'd felt kinda relieved that you realized that wasn't very a happy home. 

00:18:55
 (inaudible ). 

00:19:00
BETTY Ah, up until that time, I'd always thought that Scott(ph) viewed our life as a family as being relatively good and relatively happy. And I thought he is blocking out some of the bad things that happened. And, uhm, I guess I was, it made me feel good to us to realize that he did see it as it was, as if we did argue a lot. It wasn't, ah, it wasn't tranquil. 

00:19:25
SCOTT  No, there isn't bad things that, ah, that we don't like, but I don't like some of the things that my mom and dad, and some, and some of the things (inaudible ). 

00:19:43
COUNSELOR  Uh hmm, you don't like some of those things. 

00:19:45
SCOTT Uh hmm. 

00:19:45
COUNSELOR Ah, maybe I have(ph) talks with her so we could know. (crosstalk) 

00:19:50
SCOTT I don't know. 

00:19:50
COUNSELOR I understand what you feel. 

00:19:50
SCOTT Were go in shopping with stuff but (inaudible ) 

00:19:57
  Was there anything going on in that Betty(ph)? 

00:20:00
BETTY Ah, yeah, uhm, I was, you know, like I hadn't given my kids much credit as he deserved. And it, I, I, I, and I think I know Scott(ph) in a way and I know that he's really, now he thinks not a lot and does, and he's really a sensitive child. And I was, I guess prior to that I have really felt that he was kind of been sensitive to what I want, you know, to what I felt and it was like another brochure(ph) and at this whole things that I don't do right and things that he does, his dad doesn't do right. And I think that's kind of important, I'd ever see people who's being perfect all the time. And I thought he, I thought his dad was kind of perfect all the time. 

00:20:40
  Uhm, do you recall how you're feeling as you were thinking those things? 

00:20:50
BETTY Yeah, that, and here's what I'm showing right now as like I'm really proud of that kid. It was, you know, uhm, I know it was, that was a really, really difficult thing for him to say and it was like I was trying to help him, I couldn't help this kind of(ph) thing. 

00:21:10
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) Did you notice in this tape how the mother had the chance to tell the boys about her concern that they maybe blaming her for the divorce? How she fears that they may believe. She broke up a perfectly happy home and how relief she was to hear from them that they understood the things were far from perfect. It was also useful for the mother and boys that the boys finally expressed their pain to her both verbally and through tears which they apparently had not done previously. The recall was useful for the therapist who felt responsible that somehow he had opened up a very painful interaction. For him to hear from the mother that this indeed had been their agenda seem to be both a surprise and a relief. After the family interview, but before the recall session began, Dr. Kagan, ask the family and the therapist, if they wanted to go ahead and do a mutual recall session, continue as the group session or stop the process altogether. Each member asked to proceed so everyone, including the boys, chose to go through the recall. Nonetheless, Dr. Kagan has stated that he will record not having conducted separate recall sessions with the boys alone and was the mother alone. His belief was that the boys would have gotten more from the recall session if they had been given the security and comfort of an individual recall session, part of an individual recall session.

  Hmm, sort of crowded here and there sometimes. 

00:24:25
  Crowded. 

00:24:30
 And frustration with me when I, if I put together, a jigsaw puzzle there's frustration. It's a lot of frustration for me. 

00:24:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:24:45
  Can you say more about that? What's, what's frustrating about it? What's that mean? (crosstalk) 

00:24:55
 Uhm, the time. 

00:24:55
 Uh hmm. I just thought something there. My mother does that. She talks with him. She says all the words. That's exactly what I was doing. He was saying frustration and I was going to frustration... (crosstalk) 

00:25:15
 (inaudible ). 

00:25:18
 ...and my mouth was moving. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
 (inaudible ) 

00:25:21
 Hmm, I did notice that at all. (crosstalk) 

00:25:21
 (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:25:24
 I did either(ph). 

00:25:25
 I just saw it. Did you? That I was, (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
 I notice you were smiling. (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
 ...that I was fairly. 

00:25:30
 I noticed you were smiling and I wondered why because Troy was talking about something quite serious. 

00:25:35
 Yeah. 

00:25:35
 I thought that was sort of, ah, very complicated word to come out with... (crosstalk) 

00:25:40
 (inaudible ) 

00:25:42
 And I wasn't sure how, sure to use words, ah, that was his word or somebody else's word. I think I need that feeling that was his word. 

00:25:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
[sil.] 

00:25:50
  Wanna says there anything else? Yeah, okay. 

00:26:00
 Ah, sometimes, uhm, I tried to get more often. 

00:26:10
 How you manage to do that? 

00:26:10
  Stop. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
 Uh hmm. How do all the members of the family deal with their frustration when they have it at home? 

00:26:20
  Hmm, I don't know. Ha, I don't really know that but I know that they do get rid of it. 

00:26:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:35
 Stop (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:26:39
 Maybe they can say something about that but. 

00:26:40
 Yeah, I, I remember, it flash in my mind, why is Troy answering for everyone? My intent was to invite everyone to comment on how they dealt with their frustrations but it's as if he was speaking for the family. 

00:26:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:55
 And I didn't know whether that was, that he was programmed to speak for the family because others were kind of an... (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:27:05
 ...not ready to take a risk... (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:27:05
 ...or whether he felt like it and uhm. 

00:27:10
TROY It just felt like doing it. 

00:27:10
 You just felt like doing it. (crosstalk) 

00:27:10
TROY Uh hmm. 

00:27:10
  Yeah, I thought it was a little, you know, 'coz I heard the question kinda going to all of us, and all of a sudden, his voice came out and he started responding to it. 

00:27:20
  Bob smiled and they had a message between the two of them. Could you, before you go on, Roger, could you give us a sense of what the message was between the two of which is then? 

00:27:35
 Tell me what were you feeling when you look to the, about... (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
TROY Hmm. 

00:27:40
 daddy's decision. 

00:27:40
TROY I was, I wasn't really thinking about it. (sighs) 

00:27:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:27:45
 Were you thinking about it one day? (crosstalk) 

00:27:50
TROY I was, I was remembering. 

00:27:50
  Can you tell us what you remembering? 

00:27:55
TROY When he did go to school at Bolt(ph) State. (clears throat) 

00:28:00
  What was that like for you Troy. 

00:28:05
TROY  Hmm. 

00:28:10
 I asked Troy because I felt that in a sense you were uhm, shifting the, the opportunity to answer or the responsibility to answer, what I have to him. You kinda rather than speaking for yourself, you were ah. (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
 How did you feel Troy? 

00:28:30
 Right. Which, uhm, then I'd remember that he had earlier been very active in answering for the family and I had the, the thought and have it now. Uhm, do you kinda program him to say first, (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
 Yeah. 

00:28:50
 to test the waters like ah, "Troy, why don't you run down on the beach and see... (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
 But it's cold. (laughs) 

00:28:50
  how cold it is?" And then, come back and tell us, and you kinda waiting and if he says, "It's too cold," he won't go. And if he says, "Hey, it's okay." Okay, gang, let's go. That he is the environment tester so to speak. 

00:29:05
 It might be I haven't looked at up before. 

00:29:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
  Seems like it is to what is them. (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
 I'm, I'm thinking about something that was said the other day about the, you are speaking for me at times and I just wonder if somehow or another, very subtly, we haven't set it up so that ah, in certain situations, he speaks for us. 

00:29:35
 And I have never seen it before but. 

00:29:35
  Yeah. 

00:29:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
 I have to take a look at that. 

00:29:40
  Because Roger was absent so much from their home, I was very close to Troy and that, I think I probably overprotected him. And when he begun school, we had quite a few problems. Troy can talk about that. 

00:30:00
TROY Hmm. I didn't really wanna go... (crosstalk) 

00:30:05
 Stop(ph). 

00:30:05
TROY ...to school. Then, uhm, I didn't, I know what she meant by, uhm, he had a lot, lot of problems but I just remember, uhm, I was wanting to be with through too much than I was suppose to. I didn't wanna go, I wanted to stay home and not do anything, and thing like that. (sighs) 

00:30:35
  Maybe I made it sound like too many problems or maybe I should have said we had a few problems, I really guess I didn't mean too many. Did that scare you when I said, so many problems or... (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
TROY Hmm. 

00:30:50
 ...a lot of problems? 

00:30:50
TROY  A little bit. 

00:30:55
 Yeah. I, I guess I didn't mean that, Troy. I think I meant we had a few problems, but we, we did find out what they were and we did work on them, and now, today I feel like we've worked a lot of that out. Do you? 

00:31:10
TROY Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
  I don't really know that the decision's where arbitrary decisions. I think there were things that were given or if I thought, it was quite a bit of discussion Nancy and I traveled a little bit ah, different places to check out different jobs and, and the process of our travels at more opportunity to talk, I think the most apprehensive part of it was the financial security because I was making good money in industry and changing fields meant that I was going to have to work for less. 

00:31:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:31:55
 And. (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
 Where did Marcia(ph), where do you think she got that arbitrary thing from? We, did you hear that Julianton(ph)? 

00:32:00
MARCIA I was, I was, I was looking at Troy. 

00:32:05
 Oh, I said at once, what is like, I didn't accuse you of being, you know, arbitrary. 

00:32:10
  That's what I was feeling. 

00:32:15
 Uh-huh. 

00:32:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
 That, that made up his mind that, ah, we were gonna move and so that's what we did. 

00:32:20
  Did you feel I said that or Nancy said that? Or implied that? 

00:32:30
 I don't think it was implied, I think Nancy may have implied a little bit but I, it doesn't seemed true because of all, (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
  Deal with her now. Let's have the two of you. (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
 because of all the discussion. Yeah, I don't, I don't really think she implied it. I think I have to own it 'coz sometimes I feel like the decisions were almost arbitrary and... (crosstalk) 

00:32:50
 (inaudible ) 

00:32:54
  that's what I was doing and I don't think I really need to put it on anybody else or that she implied, yeah. And. (crosstalk) 

00:33:00
 Innocent guilt? 

00:33:00
  Yeah, that maybe I have been. 

00:33:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:33:05
  Uhm, I, I was feeling that, that I didn't feel so much, you know, be courteous now but, but I remember being at then the feeling, "Hey, we're loading on this guy, he's the bad guy." (crosstalk) 

00:33:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
 Hmm. 

00:33:15
  And when I was looking at Troy, uhm, I was thinking something about that too as he saying that too, "Is this the bad guy?" 

00:33:25
  When in fact, I don't think we felt that way. And we, (crosstalk) 

00:33:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:33:30
  I think I don't know. As I was looking at Troy but I felt bad that that was happening. 

00:33:35
  You mention the time in your life before the kids came, could you give us a sense of, how did the two of you, of all the people in the world, connect? 

00:33:50
 It's funny. (laughs) 

00:33:50
 (inaudible ) 

00:33:55
 Uh-huh. 

00:33:55
 Well. (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
 Can you tell me about that sometime, not really like necessary itself but... (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
  Not really, 'coz it got meaning, yeah. 

00:34:00
 ...the idea of the whole people, why you two and why you connected and decided to stay as a family. (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
 We kinda know about some background influence, we move both race about three blocks away from each other... (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:34:10
  and a lot of influence there, the school, same schools, same friends. 

00:34:20
 When was you first know each other? 

00:34:20
 I was about 12 and he was about 14 or 15, (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:34:25
 and we dated. 

00:34:25
 I guess what I'm thinking right there is, (sigh) how we we're too young to know what we want really. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:34:35
 (inaudible ) 

00:34:37
 I think that's just a little thinking. I have very strong feelings about that, that uhm, it was because we were three blocks away from each other at first uhm, for me and Roger is still a different thing to say about it but then time is what, we both found the goals that we wanted to reach, I think that's what we're going to talk about and we found out that we, both like the same things. 

00:35:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:35:00
  But even we got married, I felt, I feel now, when I was feeling in a tape there that we were really, really didn't know as adults what we wanted. 

00:35:10
  Any kind of feeling so we're going along or are you having those thoughts? 

00:35:15
  I think I was, I'm happy about what's involved, climb some peaks and valleys but I put it that way we'll get smooth that again. 

00:35:30
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Well, conducting a family therapy session especially with two therapist involved and then conducting a recall session with a separate inquirer can certainly be a complex situation. What are some of the things that interested you? How about the illustration of the so-called "family systems at work?" Was it interesting to see the way in which different members of the family assumed different roles and different assignments? Recall how Dr. Kagan talked in the theory tape about people programming each other? Well, we saw an example of this with Troy, who presumably was programmed to be the tester of the waters of the family. The family's rocky roads and their struggle to smooth it out again are certainly poignant. Life indeed is a journey, not a destination.

00:36:35
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  A logical sequence for studying and facilitating, helping relationships is to begin first with individual recall sessions of the helper, the counselor, physician, or supervisor, then, to move on to recall sessions of the client, patient or supervisee(ph). And finally, to do a mutual recall was helper and client. These three-stage process can be use in a classroom interactions. In the next film, two teachers work as a team. They have agreed to be inquirers for each other. First, a regular class session is videotaped. It usually doesn't take long for the students to overcome the novelty of having a camera in the room. An individual recall session, is then conducted, was the teacher's colleagues serving as inquirer for her. And the second stage, the entire group of students can be treated as the equivalent of the client. First, several minutes of the class session is videotaped. In this case, the class was in art lesson. Before leaving the room, the teacher prepares the students for what will follow. 

00:38:40
Interview 

00:38:40
MR. PHILIP  Okay, okay, if you took the distance from the bottom of the eye to the top of the eye, there would be about the same distance as there is between the top of the eye and the eyebrow. 

00:39:00
 (inaudible ) 

00:39:03
MR. PHILIP All right. Ah, are you a doubter? Hi, Mrs. Rappa. 

00:39:05
MRS. RAPPA Hi. How are you? 

00:39:10
MR. PHILIP Good. Hey listen. Kids, today as you know, we've been videotaping this class and I've asked Mrs. Rappa to come in and take a look at the videotape with you people. Now, I'm going to leave the room so I want you to be as truthful as you can about your feelings that, that have happened while we've been going over the lesson. The thoughts you've had while we've been going over the lesson, and, and Mrs. Rappa will, will be able to talk to you about them. So I want your, your very, very, most honest feelings and ah, just be good class like you always are. 

00:39:45
MRS. RAPPA  Great, thank you so much. (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
MR. PHILIP I'm gonna step out. We'll see you later. 

00:39:50
MRS. RAPPA Okay, fine. Thanks. (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
MR. PHILIP Bye-bye. 

00:39:50
MRS. RAPPA Uh hmm. Well, as Mr. Philip said, you've videotape this lesson and the reason that I came down is to go over the tape with you. We all know that we can think a lot faster than we can talk. Is that right, do you think? 

00:40:05
  Uh hmm. 

00:40:10
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) The recall process is then carefully explained to the students again by the inquirer. Many people have difficulty engaging in the recall process at first, but in time, most are able to use the process productively. 

00:40:25
Student's Recall Session 

00:40:25
MR. PHILIP  Okay, where are the eyes in relation to, to the other parts of the face? Anybody see some. 

00:40:40
MRS. RAPPA Brat. 

00:40:40
BRAT When he asked the question, "Where are the eyes in relation to the face?" I felt, what a stupid question. I mean, you know, you know all, where are the eyes are, you know, in your face, they're right above the nose and the mouth. 

00:40:50
MRS. RAPPA Okay. 

00:40:50
BRAT I was ready to say, "Mr. Philip, what are we in? Kindergarten?" 

00:40:55
MRS. RAPPA Okay. What were the risks involved in saying that, Brat? 

00:41:00
BRAT Well, he, he probably would have said, "Well, I wasn't asking about where they were on your face, I was asking where they were, you know, in relation to everything else on how high and low they are from the forehead and everything." I will really felt like an idiot because... (crosstalk) 

00:41:15
MRS. RAPPA Okay. 

00:41:15
BRAT ...everyone else would have thought that. 

00:41:20
MRS. RAPPA Okay. How would it feel to feel like an idiot, Brat? 

00:41:20
BRAT  Uhm, say, like you're this tall and everyone is five feet, six feet tall, 

00:41:30
MRS. RAPPA Okay. 

00:41:30
BRAT and you're gonna be trampled. 

00:41:35
MRS. RAPPA Anna. 

00:41:35
ANNA Most teachers, (clears throat) if you get it like your question wrong, they make you feel just like a fool and say, "Look at this stupid person. They got it wrong." And about Mr. Philip, he just can't ignores it and goes in. 

00:41:45
MRS. RAPPA How, how does that make you feel when, (crosstalk) 

00:41:50
ANNA Uh hmm. 

00:41:50
MRS. RAPPA when he ignores it and goes on? 

00:41:50
ANNA Well, it makes you feel good 'coz if you got it wrong, hmm. 

00:41:55
MRS. RAPPA Uh hmm. 

00:41:55
ANNA You just, just stupid. 

00:41:55
MR. PHILIP  I want you to turn towards your partner and measure from the very, very bottom of the face, way up to the very top of the face, now that's way up to the top of the head, too. See how tall your face is. 

00:42:15
MRS. RAPPA  Mary. 

00:42:20
MARY Ah, like in some teacher like in Math or something when they, when they tell you something, do something, they just say, "Do it." They don't explain it if, if it's possible to explain it, they (inaudible ) but Mr. Philip, when he said to measure he showed you how to do it and some teachers just say, "Do it," you know. 

00:42:35
MRS. RAPPA Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
MARY And I don't, and it, it all confuse, you know, what do you mean? 

00:42:40
MRS. RAPPA Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
MARY Like he wouldn't, usually doesn't confu, tries not to confuse people. 

00:42:40
MRS. RAPPA  Okay. And how does that make you feel, Mary? 

00:42:45
MARY Good, and I don't feel so confused, you know. (laughs) 

00:42:50
MRS. RAPPA Uh-huh. Okay. Anything else? 

00:42:50
MARY No. 

00:42:50
MRS. RAPPA  Uh hmm. Okay. Louis. 

00:42:55
LOUIS Well, he, he mixed in, (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
 Uh-huh. 

00:42:55
LOUIS in the things like, like if he was baking a cake, you know, uhm, you got meters and centimeters and inches, different things like, you say, "Uhm, we got, we got a good measuring systems, you know, I don't want to hear about that." But you know, he said, "It's, you gonna measure your partner's face and that," you know. He put in some interesting, interesting stuff was, with boring stuff. 

00:43:20
MRS. RAPPA Oh, I see, okay. Anything else there, Louis? 

00:43:25
LOUIS And I just thought I would tell you. 

00:43:25
MRS. RAPPA Okay. Mike. 

00:43:25
MIKE Well, I was sort of happy about Mr. Philip a bit 'coz he could see that we are starting to get bored and he did that like to cheers(ph) it up. 

00:43:35
MR. PHILIP Dave, got some milk? 

00:43:35
DAVE  Just a little bit (inaudible ) 

00:43:41
MR. PHILIP Did you measure way up to the top of the head? 

00:43:41
DAVE Yes, I do. 'Coz I'm a little bit sure. 

00:43:45
MR. PHILIP I think you'll find if you measure it carefully, you will find that the eyes are exactly almost, exactly half way down the waist. Wow, huh? 

00:44:00
MRS. RAPPA Maureen. 

00:44:00
MAUREEN It like, you know, almost exactly in the middle, I thought, you know, how can we be almost exactly, you know, like that's really weird. 

00:44:10
MRS. RAPPA Uh-huh. 

00:44:10
MAUREEN I couldn't figure out what's the reason behind it. 

00:44:10
MRS. RAPPA  Did you wanna let him know, now... (crosstalk) 

00:44:15
MAUREEN Uh-uh. 

00:44:15
MRS. RAPPA ...that your thinking this? How come? 

00:44:15
MAUREEN  'Coz ah, I feel really weird if I tell the teacher, you know, that, you know, I don't understand, you know, what their giving at or something like that. 

00:44:25
MRS. RAPPA Uh hmm. Okay. Any risks? 

00:44:30
MAUREEN Embarrassment. 

00:44:30
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  The third stage is mutual recall. Again, a classroom interaction is recorded in this example. Part of a lesson on careers was taped. The mutual recall sessions which follow are conducted with one teacher serving as inquirer for his colleague and her students. 

00:44:50
Mutual Recall Session 

00:44:50
MRS. RAPPA  Is there anybody that would like to, like to talk about some of their thoughts, as to what they'd like to be when they grow up. 

00:45:05
LINDA Teach the deaf. 

00:45:05
MRS. RAPPA  Either a speech therapist or teach the deaf. Okay, that's interesting. Were there any particular uhm, things that make you decide? 

00:45:15
LINDA Yeah. 

00:45:15
MRS. RAPPA Do you think about that? 

00:45:15
LINDA  My best friend is deaf. 

00:45:20
MRS. RAPPA Okay, your best friend is deaf, great. 

00:45:20
MR. PHILIP Jackie, what was there? 

00:45:25
JACKIE I didn't see it when I was, what was going on, but I just notice, now looking at, she looks really nervous about what she was saying. I mean, I couldn't see which was saying some way back here and she's up there. But when, I, I saw her saying it now, she looked really nervous about what she was saying. 

00:45:40
 (inaudible ) 

00:45:41
MR. PHILIP Okay, Mrs. Rappa, was there anything there for you? 

00:45:41
MRS. RAPPA  Yes, there was something there for me. And soon, Linda said that her best friend was deaf and as soon, at my response to that was, great, great. And as I soon as I said that I thought, "Oh," you know. (laughs) I don't wanna communicate that I mean, great, great that her best friend is deaf, but that's what it sounds like I did, I meant... (crosstalk) 

00:46:00
LINDA I didn't notice that. 

00:46:00
MRS. RAPPA ...to mean, great, great that, that that was your decision to become a speech therapist or work with the deaf. And as soon as I was finished saying that, I wish I wouldn't said something different. 

00:46:15
 Did anyone pick that out? Did, Mark. 

00:46:20
MARK Uhm, I'm, I was thinking of something else about when she said that. I was thinking like, you know, she's the type of girl that, you know, has these things like that, like her best friend and stuff and she doesn't, you know, go on and taking no less, ah, she doesn't go around saying, "My best friend is deaf." 

00:46:40
MR. PHILIP Uh hmm. 

00:46:40
MARK You know, she, she treats people like doing(ph) the same as her , you know.

00:48:35
MR. PHILIP Uh hmm. 

00:48:35
JACKIE There's something like that and I just don't, I mean, I, I was so scared of making a fool out of myself in front of everybody else, that I don't wanna say the thing that anybody else is gonna think stupid.

And then, Mark raise his hand, and I thought, that was really need of Mark to do that because he admitted to the whole group that he had really hadn't thought much about what he wanted to be.

MR. PHILIP Okay, how's that make you feel? 

00:53:05
JERIC  That she understands what I'm talking about. 

00:53:10
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  Well, what did you think? Notice the young girls comment about the teachers nervousness, uh-oh, she's nervous again, she's going to ask us a big question to cover up her nervousness and then the look on the teacher's face, as she heard that comment. We believe there's a lot to be gained from such sessions in terms of opening up communication between teachers and students. In fact, where the entire IPR program including classroom recalls has been used, there have been significant positive changes especially in the way children feel about teachers and about to each other.
