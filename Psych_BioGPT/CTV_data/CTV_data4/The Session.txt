BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
UNKNOWN So, welcome back Jen(ph), and we have a better now work together. 

00:00:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:00:05
UNKNOWN Where would you like to start? 

00:00:10
UNKNOWN Actually it just struck me as, you know, I've been thinking about coming back to see you today, and, ah, just as you just said welcome back, we got an hour I'm aware of it, I'm really nervous about, uhm, coming back and, ah, talking to you. 

00:00:25
UNKNOWN So thinking about it just made you feel nervous, here right in this moment. 

00:00:30
UNKNOWN Hmm. Yeah, yeah. Uhm, partly about, you know, what I'm going to be saying, and, uhm, once it said, it's, it's out there. 

00:00:40
UNKNOWN All right, so speaking it, makes it more visible. 

00:00:45
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. Almost having acknowledge it to myself. 

00:00:45
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN Uhm, but, uhm, I suppose what I was thinking about was, uhm, oh, it sounds really weird to say it really, but sort of, uhm, uhm, because be-- eh-- eh, you know, become a grandmother this year and gonna be another grandmother and, ah, sort of made some choices about career. And uhm, and I suppose it's sort of thinking about, well, again what, you know, now what? Uhm. 

00:01:30
UNKNOWN Where did I go from here? 

00:01:30
UNKNOWN Hmm. Yeah, to a certain extent, uhm, been feeling really tired, uhm, and sort of asking myself, is this normal? You know, to feel this tired all the time. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN Hmm, so it concerned about your tiredness. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:01:55
UNKNOWN You know, asking, this is how it should be, is this normal? 

00:01:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, uhm. Because I'm really sick to expect that things I used to be able to do in day, you know, the tasks that I used to set myself to do in a day, I don't seem to achieve and, and is that, you know, is that, you know, why I can't I do it? 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN Hmm. Why couldn't you do the things that came naturally? 

00:02:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, but I had so much more energy for. And, ah, I supposed what brought it too hard is thinking about, you know, ah, being the grandmother and thinking well, all the things I'd liked to be able to do, uhm, with, you know, with the grandchildren. Am I gonna have the energy for, oh my. 

00:02:50
UNKNOWN So that's what's added to your thoughts becoming a, a grandmother. 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:02:55
UNKNOWN Yes, probably did you think in this, in this way? 

00:03:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, sort of, sort of brought in my head, you know, because I supposed what it's got me thinking about is all the things I used to do when the children were little and how energy I had and, ah, you know, things I used to do with the children and, and one thing about to do them, you know, when I have the chance with the grandchildren and am I going to? You know, you know, I'm gonna be able to, and then there's a part of me, uhm, thinking, I can't even (inaudible ) two on to, which is a bit of surprising feeling actually. 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN It's surprise you that you can think clear about that, do I actually want to? 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:03:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, when you want to talk first how you know, how am I gonna do it? 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN Do I want? 

00:03:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, sort of the almost easier just to, uhm, not getting involved, not do anything with them, not, uhm. 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN You should have step back from it? 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Hmm, yeah. Less effort and I wonder if part of me thinking, you know, physical effort well, certainly le-- less physical effort, but also, you know, to an extent sort of less emotional effort. 

00:04:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, less getting emotionally involved. 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN With them. 

00:04:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. Uhm, and sort of thinking because possibly that means than less chance of getting hurt. 

00:04:50
UNKNOWN So if you don't get emotionally involved is less likely that I will get, you will get hurt. 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:04:55
UNKNOWN By the experience. 

00:05:00
UNKNOWN Hmm. Sort of disappointed that, ah, that I've, you know, and perhaps not as important to them as, I'd like to be or I don't see them as much as I'd like to or they don't love me as much as they love their other grandparents so... 

00:05:15
UNKNOWN So a lot underlying for you. 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. So, sorry, sorry, so in some ways it's almost easier to not do anything. 

00:05:30
UNKNOWN You shall not to do with anything but risky, perhaps to involve yourself. 

00:05:35
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:05:35
UNKNOWN The risks are higher there. Tell me if I got that right? 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, you ha-- you have, I was, I was thinking about it cuz I think, you know, if I am-- if I thought logically I would say, well, no. But, ah, I think you're right, I think the risks are higher to lay yourself open to someone, you know, to or be, maybe I am not probably not aware at all, all of this, you know, they're probably not aware how, ah, how much I sort of love them, or want to love, and want to be part of their lives and actually how more important to me they are than perhaps I am to them and I'm-- there's a part of me hoping that I will be, you know, the granny that they love and the granny that's fun, and the granny that's got a lot of energy but, uhm, there's a chance that I won't be that person. And, ah, even if I tried hard so, you know, that, that sorry the, the, the risk is, you know, to put the effort and then they don't like me or I could sort of say, oh, well, you know, I don't see them very much so they, yeah. 

00:07:05
UNKNOWN So I ca-- I can-- you can rationalize, you're saying I can rationalize or take the risk and involve myself and the end result of that is that they won't, they won't love me, they won't like me. 

00:07:15
UNKNOWN Hmm, or they like others better. Oh, jeez. 

00:07:20
UNKNOWN Like them better than they like you. 

00:07:25
UNKNOWN Yes, they want to spend more time with them and I supposed to know kind effect from that is, uhm, that means I'll see less of my own children because if the children don't like going to, you know, grandma Jen(ph) then, you know, then I won't see. 

00:07:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, your children won't bring your grandchildren. 

00:07:50
UNKNOWN That's right. That's right. 

00:07:55
UNKNOWN So you'll miss-- you lose the two of them, you lose your children. 

00:07:55
UNKNOWN That's right. 

00:07:55
UNKNOWN And your children's children. 

00:07:55
UNKNOWN That's right. 

00:08:05
[sil.] 

00:08:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. But that feels, I'm sorry but, it feels really, uhm. That feels really upsetting actually. 

00:08:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. I open up to think for a few minutes, you know, there are tears in your eyes. 

00:08:35
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN It's actually painful. 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean the thought that went through my head, as, as a, as you're talking was, ah, I sort of don't deserve to have them love me, ah, which is, you know, sort of be the ultimate payback. For all that, you know, for all the, uhm, you know, all the things I didn't do as a mom, you know, sort of the ultimate payback as, ah, you know, you lose out on the-- as a, as a grandmother. 

00:09:25
UNKNOWN Not closer or comes around. 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN Sort of, yeah, sort of. And I supposed what I've noticed myself doing, I mean, I've only got grandchild at the moment but I know some self-doing is, is putting awful lot of effort in to trying sort of talk to them everyday and I'm thinking-- I mean, sometimes it feels like an effort, I mean not that I don't love them or anything but it feels like I have to keep doing that, just to keep reminding them that I exist, I exist. Remember me. 

00:10:05
UNKNOWN Here I am. 

00:10:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, love me too. 

00:10:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, please don't forget me. 

00:10:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, and I think it's made harder because we don't live close by and, uhm, and it's my son's child and so my expectation is, you know, the daughter-in-law are not going, you know, not necessary gonna phone me if the baby is not feeding, or the baby is, yeah, and so, ah. 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN So you'll be excluded again. 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. And I'm fighting with part of me thinking, you know, well sort of you know, I get on my own life, you know, I won't, I won't worry about them, I won't, uhm, you know, do stuff, uhm, because I don't wanna get hurt of being rejected which is, you know, which is what I fear is. 

00:11:00
UNKNOWN So to prevent the rejection or the risk of rejection it's soiled give away. 

00:11:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. So if I don't go close then I won't get hurt. 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN And then you'll see. 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN Almost like a stomp. 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, well it was a little bit. I mean that is my modus operandi, you know, always has been I remember from a child, you know, very noisy (inaudible ) in the hope that they've notice. 

00:11:26
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:11:26
UNKNOWN I guess it's the same, you know, so of course they don't. 

00:11:35
UNKNOWN And you're left high and dry. 

00:11:40
UNKNOWN Well I'm left having to put... 

00:11:40
UNKNOWN More of it, more of it again. 

00:11:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, more of it. 

00:11:45
UNKNOWN Okay, so I feel empty every time. 

00:11:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. I'm sort of be the magnanimous woman doesn't get upset when I don't get a mother day card, don't get upset when I don't get a birthday present and don't get a Christmas present, you know, and yet thinking or why not, you know, why don't they do that? 

00:12:00
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:12:05
UNKNOWN You know, why don't they send me a Christmas card dear grandma, you know, when I see other people doing it, and I used to do it and, you know, well. 

00:12:15
UNKNOWN But they might not. And they don't. 

00:12:20
UNKNOWN No they don't. 

00:12:20
UNKNOWN And that really hurts? 

00:12:20
UNKNOWN It does, it does. Yeah. 

00:12:30
UNKNOWN And it sounds like it hurt so even though you might give every appearance that it doesn't, you know, I don't know of that's. 

00:12:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. I mean I, I've tried sort of them, ah, we tried subtle hints, I've tried, uhm, I've tried, you know, my husband trying to, ah, tell them, you know, remember it's your mom's birthday, remember it's your mom's birthday, you know, what you're getting your mom for Christmas this year? And then, and I suppose what brought it to her head this, you know, before coming to see you, was that, it was my son's birthday, ah, last week and I didn't buy any present, I send him a card but I didn't buy him a present and I feel really, really mean and really cruel, ah. 

00:13:25
UNKNOWN You feel mean and cruel because you didn't send him a card. 

00:13:30
UNKNOWN I send him a card. 

00:13:30
UNKNOWN Not a present. 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN But I didn't send him a present. 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

00:13:35
UNKNOWN Because, because I didn't get one. But, you know, it was like, ah, something has gonna stop, you know, if, if it doesn't matter to you not getting present and things then... 

00:13:55
UNKNOWN If it does matter to you I'm gonna show it, doesn't matter to me - 

00:13:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:14:00
UNKNOWN - either. 

00:14:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:14:00
UNKNOWN But it looks like it matters greatly. 

00:14:00
UNKNOWN Oh, I feel really guilty. I feel really guilty, I feel, you know, I've upset them. You know, I feel guilty that I don't buy something for the-- my grandson and send it on a regular basis. I feel guilty that I haven't put load to (inaudible ) for them, you know, I feel guilty. You know, you know thinking as you sa-- I so saying that, you know, that it's all about material things and actually I feel guilty that I haven't done the material things because in many respect it's the most obvious way of showing love - 

00:14:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:14:50
UNKNOWN - somebody especially when they are not close by cuz I can't have him to stay and I can't, you know, uhm. 

00:15:00
UNKNOWN You can't have what you really want. 

00:15:00
UNKNOWN Well, yeah, yeah, to see them and be part of their lives. 

00:15:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:15:05
UNKNOWN You know to be needed I suppose. 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:15:15
UNKNOWN So you give it back in material ways but even you've cut that off - 

00:15:20
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:15:20
UNKNOWN - as well. And it's hiding what you really want as to be noticed by them. 

00:15:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:15:30
UNKNOWN To be loved by them. 

00:15:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, to sort of be a part of their life. 

00:15:35
UNKNOWN Hmm, not to be excluded. 

00:15:35
UNKNOWN Hmm, yeah, that's the, that's, you know, that for me is the most painful bit, I mean that's the bit that sort of got like the, sort of historical, sort of hurt. Is that, you know, being excluded. 

00:16:00
UNKNOWN That's hurt really hits. 

00:16:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, it is. You know like a, a like the party that you've, your bets friends having that you are not invited to something, you know that sort of, that's so bad. 

00:16:15
UNKNOWN Be uninvited one. 

00:16:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. That they're all having a nice time and I am not sort of, you know, that's, you know, that's sort of failing. 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN They're all... 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN They're all there except me. 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN Almost like you looking in through the window. 

00:16:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. And I suppose that's the feeling that I get with, you know, my son and his wife and my grandson that they are having a life, understandably that I'm not a part of but also that, they're also sharing that with other family members that are not part of. 

00:16:55
UNKNOWN So you understand it? 

00:16:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:16:55
UNKNOWN You know, the rational is that... 

00:16:55
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah, totally, totally. 

00:17:00
UNKNOWN You know, you can say well they have every right to do that. 

00:17:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:17:00
UNKNOWN But I'm still on the outside. 

00:17:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. And they might be giving to others that you are not receiving. 

00:17:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean it, it doesn't-- once feel like quite a childish sort of emotion really, you know, you got to love me sort, you know, you've got to love me. 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN Uhm, but. 

00:17:25
UNKNOWN I cry for you, you've got to love me and also feels very-- a very childish - 

00:17:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:17:35
UNKNOWN - emotion. 

00:17:35
UNKNOWN It does, it does. 

00:17:40
[sil.] 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, I sort of like to be special, you know, like, ah, you know, I can remember my relationship with my grandparents I only had to, ah, my dad's, ah, well, ah, my dad's mother died, you know, when I was of two so I can't remember her, that my mom's, uhm, parents, I had them, you know, real awareness that I was special, you know, that, that real special relationship being going to grandparents and look at my granny was not the most vociferous so demonstrative but my granddad was and I knew I was special and it was really nice, you know, sort of... 

00:18:35
UNKNOWN You were cherished. 

00:18:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, to, yeah, it's a nice word. 

00:18:35
UNKNOWN Really precious, special and you knew that. 

00:18:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:18:45
UNKNOWN You experienced that. 

00:18:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. There's a part of me sort of passes well how do you get that? You know how am I gonna create with my own grandchildren. 

00:18:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:18:55
UNKNOWN How do you get it? You know, do you have to spend lots of money or do you have to cook a lots, or do you have to? 

00:19:05
UNKNOWN It's like you just thought know how to do that. 

00:19:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:19:10
UNKNOWN Like you're figuring it out, do you cook for them, do you spend money on them to buy them presents. 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. You feel... 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN It feels like you're saying it just don't know. 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN Yeah, (inaudible ) actually. Yeah. Yeah, how do you made them love you? Yeah, can you make them children, you know, sort of no, uhm, we're not you even know what it, you know, what they need. Uhm, to, to, to make me feel loved and it's not, you know, it's not the fact to, you know, suddenly like I wanting someone to send-- spend lots of money and buy me lots of present but it's the fact that they don't. You know, they don't, don't dream of treating their mom, and I'm thinking but why not? 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN Sounds like you're saying you feel unloved by them or your children that it might be that you will be unloved by, your grandchildren. 

00:20:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:20:20
UNKNOWN And what on earth can I do to change that. 

00:20:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, what can I do and what have I done? 

00:20:30
[sil.] 

00:20:35
UNKNOWN What have I done, let me see if it, this is right, what have I done that I've become so unlovable? 

00:20:45
[sil.] 

00:20:50
UNKNOWN Pity much. 

00:20:55
[sil.] 

00:21:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:21:10
[sil.] 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, because, whatever you've done you can't, can't do it. And in order, whatever I've done in order for this sort of spelled to be broken you've got to talk about it. You've got to, uhm, you got to hear their feelings and that takes, you know, that takes, uhm, willingness, you know, and I supposed, I supposed I've try to, uhm, show that, you know, that, you know, whatever it is I've done I'm very happy, oh, happy is a wrong word but prepared to hear the effect it had on them. 

00:22:25
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah. 

00:22:25
UNKNOWN But if it goes unsaid then there's never any chance to say sorry, or to, to move on. 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN And the spell remains. 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN And it remains. 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN And you can't break it. 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN I can't because it needs, it needs, you know, the children, it needs, you know, my son in particular to, to say well, this is what I really like this with you. 

00:22:55
UNKNOWN It needs for them to say this to you before you could show. 

00:22:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:23:00
UNKNOWN And you can damaged stay back, and you're willing to do that. 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN I can really... 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN But it feels one way. 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, I can only say sorry. 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN If they can tell me what is it, that they, ah, angry with me for, or... 

00:23:15
UNKNOWN So that you mean to saying you don't know, why? Why are they angry with me? And they won't tell me. 

00:23:20
UNKNOWN No. 

00:23:20
UNKNOWN That's really stuck in a, between a rock in hard place. 

00:23:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. You know, I got some good ideas just to why, you know, there is you-- I'm but I, I haven't got any good ideas, I've got lots of fantasies, I assume why they think I don't want Christmas present from them or a birthday card, for, uhm, a birthday present for-- or mother's day. 

00:23:50
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:23:50
UNKNOWN You know, I've got some more ideas as to why they... 

00:23:55
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:23:55
UNKNOWN Uhm. 

00:23:55
UNKNOWN But you can't check it out. 

00:24:00
UNKNOWN No, I can't. 

00:24:00
UNKNOWN And it remains with you. 

00:24:00
UNKNOWN You know, yeah, it's just sort of the big unsaid and I, you know, I feel sort of resentful cuz it almost feels quite childish, you know, to say to, you know it, you know, your middle aged son, you know, why don't you buy me flowers for my birthday? You know, do you not love me? And I know what they'd say, of course we love you mother, you know, of course we do, you know, don 't be so silly but what they don't hear is, it's actually it's not me being silly, it's me really wanting to know, why? Especially when they are on the both, they have another. You know the mother-in-law, uhm, a present or a Christmas present or flowers. 

00:24:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:24:45
UNKNOWN Why not me? 

00:24:45
UNKNOWN I think experiencing (inaudible ) really unfair. 

00:24:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:24:50
UNKNOWN That they can give to others but why not me? 

00:24:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:24:55
UNKNOWN What the hell that I've done? And they don't seem quite to hear the what your need is - 

00:25:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:25:00
UNKNOWN - they can't hear you. 

00:25:05
UNKNOWN And they won't tell me either, that's the thing, you know, so if they could tell me, you know, ah, we don't give you that because we think you've got enough already or, uhm, you know. 

00:25:15
UNKNOWN So they might hear you but they won't give you the answer that you, you need. The answers that you need. That closer to what they're saying. 

00:25:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:25:25
UNKNOWN And they see that kinda leave me with only one conclusion to draw and almost that they-- it must because actually they don't really care. 

00:25:35
[sil.] 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN That's the conclusion. 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN It can't be not. 

00:25:40
UNKNOWN They don't care. The just don't care. 

00:25:45
UNKNOWN No. 

00:25:50
UNKNOWN And you can't check that out either. 

00:26:00
UNKNOWN Well, I mean, I try, ah, I try. 

00:26:10
UNKNOWN Sounds really weary, Jen(ph) when you said I tried sound it's so tired. 

00:26:20
[sil.] 

00:26:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean, as you said that, I sort of thought of three thoughts that went through my head, and the main one was, well, you know, why, why I get so bothered about it, ah, you know, yeah, you have tried, I have tried. And they, you know, when I have tried to talk to them and I do, you know, have tried over the years and that we have had sort of like deeper meaning of, ah, except our-- the other feeling that, uhm, and this might, you know, this might be me that because I get, I get the feeling that actually they're not really saying when I feel because they don't wanna hurt me. 

00:27:20
UNKNOWN Okay. So you have had deeper meaning for - 

00:27:25
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:27:25
UNKNOWN - conversations in the past. But your experiences-- your experience of it is that they are not quite hearing you. 

00:27:35
UNKNOWN Look quite hearing me they are not really... 

00:27:40
UNKNOWN Interested. 

00:27:40
UNKNOWN And not really saying what they want to say. 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN Okay, so they hold back. 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN Yes, they hold back, is a, yeah. 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN That's the way to put it because if that, because I can't even check that out. But the impression, the feeling I get is that, that, that, they're holding back cuz they don't want to hurt me when I've actually said to them look we need to say this, and I'm accepting that what you're gonna say I'm like the one to hear. And I suppose the message I'm gonna say to him, ah, you know, I'm ready for the hurt. 

00:28:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. You're putting it out there, look I'm, I'm open to this. 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN You can say it. 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN It might hurt me but that-- this is what I want. 

00:28:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:28:35
UNKNOWN I want you to be honest with me, I don't want you to protect me. Just tell me. 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN How it is. 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. That's... 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN That your experiences that they, they can't do that or do it. I don't know. 

00:28:45
UNKNOWN No, no. I sort of, ah, no. I get, I get told that it's my problem, you know, I should, ah, is my problem. There isn't a problem, you know, it's my problem it's in my head. It must be all about me, and yet. You know, the evidence if it was all about me then why is it that they can't hear what I'm saying, you know, or just my curiosity, isn't it? 

00:29:25
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:29:25
UNKNOWN You know, how we do that-- he can be so different with, ah, difference mother, you know, the mother-in-law to me, you know, how is that? That's not in my head, I've got the evidence. 

00:29:40
UNKNOWN So you, you notice. 

00:29:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:29:45
UNKNOWN You notice how they are with other people the evidence is there. 

00:29:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN And it is clear as clear. 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN This can be to you but not for them. 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN Is it not to your problem. 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN We're fine. 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:30:00
[sil.] 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN And of course this, you know, will have, you know, thinking about the grandchildren, you know, this will have, you know, this is why it feels really exhausting. I'm not gonna have the energy to, to get it right, you know, it have to sort of be, you know, the diplomat the, you know, the one that is always. Yes, yes no problem, you know. Yeah. 

00:30:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. So sort of you are the one that smooth it over. 

00:30:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:30:40
UNKNOWN Because if you don't you might lose them as well. 

00:30:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. You know put their needs first and, you know, the problem with that, there's something about equality of having needs in my head. You know, that there is, you know, I'm willing to put their needs first. 

00:31:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:31:10
UNKNOWN But sometimes... 

00:31:10
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:31:10
UNKNOWN You know, I have needs that need to be met as well. 

00:31:15
UNKNOWN I'm willing to meet your needs but what about mine? 

00:31:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:31:20
UNKNOWN Please what about mine? 

00:31:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. And actually that I mean, that's it, isn't it? You know, I do have some needs in, in my family relationships, you know, especially with the children. And I know they may sound, you know, when I'm talking to you it may sound really sort of mercenary, you know, I need them to send me some flowers on mother's day, I mean, I don't. Actually what I need is for them to think about it. 

00:32:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, you don't want the present you want the thought. 

00:32:00
UNKNOWN Yes, I want. 

00:32:05
UNKNOWN You want them to notice you. 

00:32:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:32:10
UNKNOWN Acknowledge you. 

00:32:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. And feel a part of their lives not, not because a bulge on the way but because they wouldn't think of it, be in any other way. 

00:32:25
UNKNOWN Yes, are you gonna have to struggle for that love, ah, it just be a given. 

00:32:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah, sort of unconditional, you know, sort of you're just there. As for but it does for very exhausted I have to think about that all the time. 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN Exhausting for you. 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:33:00
[sil.] 

00:33:15
UNKNOWN Her buckle between meeting their needs and wanting your needs is it legitimate to have my needs met. Am I worth it? 

00:33:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:33:35
UNKNOWN And I'm not sure if that was coming from my (inaudible ) or not then. 

00:33:40
UNKNOWN Well, I think they are my worth if it, you know, the answer I want to give based on would be apparently not. Yeah, apparently not. 

00:34:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:34:05
UNKNOWN And... 

00:34:05
UNKNOWN That's the answer for you. 

00:34:10
UNKNOWN That's the only answer I can draw. 

00:34:15
[sil.] 

00:34:20
UNKNOWN I'm not sort of complete the circle because that sort of the next thing and I think is both, they don't even bother. 

00:34:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:34:25
UNKNOWN They so, you know, I step my foot, then you miss me. 

00:34:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. Then you were sad. 

00:34:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. But of course it didn't work in my childhood so I don't realize going to work now, you know, it didn't, you know, it didn't work. Then... 

00:34:50
UNKNOWN Sort of he doing that childhood stomping. 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN Didn't work in-- doesn't feel if it works now. 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN No, I don't think it will cuz I can't see anyone who notices is me really. Cuz the reality there is I'm not that important to anyone else in the world. You know, the only one I'm important to is me. 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN I feel so alone. 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN Oh, it does feel, you know, it's a bit but it's that... 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, so alone. 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN The only one that you're important to is you. 

00:35:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. I guess that's it, isn't it? 

00:35:45
[sil.] 

00:36:10
UNKNOWN Now, I almost feels like, uhm, what I'm saying here I'm sort of, uhm, well I'm not but almost sounds like but I'm almost putting pressure on, you know, or anyone else I would say this to just say, "Oh, not you, you're not, you're not, you're important to me. Yeah, you're important to me, and it's..." I think it's not what on-- so, you know, this is not what I'm wanting to say. 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN I supposed it is what I wanting to say with my children I wanted them to say, oh, no, but you are, don't you matter. 

00:36:50
UNKNOWN Well, I guess for me it does evoke at needs to say that Jen(ph) you, you matter to me but I know I also at the same time feel it's not what you want. It's not enough. 

00:37:15
[sil.] 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN No, it, it's not, nothing if it's too much. 

00:37:25
UNKNOWN Okay, so what you really need is what you can't take as well. 

00:37:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, does that make sense? Jesus, that it is almost too much because that, than, ah, if I matter, you know, if I matter to you and it means you'll have expectations of me and I might have the ability to, to, to fulfill them. 

00:37:55
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah. How could the energy to give back what I give to you. 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN No. 

00:38:00
UNKNOWN And there's an expectation that I'll need something off you, as well. 

00:38:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, because that makes sense. 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN Sorry. 

00:38:25
[sil.] 

00:38:40
UNKNOWN Yes, it's so really weird sort of a concept that, you know, with that feeling of just being on your own alone, you know, even that's has always sort a negative connotations of being excluded and not being in it, not there, you know, that's the down side and the, but the good side is that, that you don't have to disappoint people or, commit to people or let people in, no. I didn't know what it feels a bit like a battle. 

00:39:20
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:39:20
UNKNOWN You know what... 

00:39:20
UNKNOWN Battle between the two. 

00:39:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, but yeah. Cuz there are, you know, that there are benefits even though the pain it is. 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:39:35
UNKNOWN Strange that-- when you thought about that before, you know. 

00:39:40
UNKNOWN The benefits to you being alone and are alone. 

00:39:45
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah, yeah. 

00:39:45
UNKNOWN Less of struggle. 

00:39:45
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, you can become an observer and become a quiet person. 

00:39:55
[sil.] 

00:40:00
UNKNOWN It almost feels-- is less painful over here. 

00:40:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, cuz, you know, you are not disappointed. 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN And you don't disappoint. 

00:40:20
UNKNOWN And you don't disappoint. Yeah, yeah, yeah and you can sort of comfort yourself with the thought that, you know, if they had known me, if they had let me in, they don't know I was a really nice person but you know, not but, but I didn't so, so sooner that can be, you know, can't. 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN Very protective of being. 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN Very protected, very, yeah. And I think to certain degree I had, you know, being working towards feeling quite comfortable with that position, I think what sort of, uhm-- matter there has been, you know, the grandchildren. 

00:41:10
UNKNOWN Oh, you're in a mess to spit-up. 

00:41:15
UNKNOWN Well, I have a little bit, yeah, because I didn't know if I'm love, you know, at least anyone but is important. You know, imminent, I didn't know if I love them I'm not sure amazing I do. 

00:41:30
UNKNOWN You really love this child. 

00:41:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, even though, you know, Carl(ph) I can imagine that you know, that he can love your grandchildren cuz they remind you of your own children was strange enough. I think I'm the only one in the whole family who said he doesn't look like his father. You know, my son he doesn't cuz he doesn't remind me at all of my son, at all in any respect. But I still love him. 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN But this is quite the fact that he doesn't look a bit like your son, you still love him. 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN And it's son-- it sounds surprising as of, oh, my goodness. 

00:42:15
UNKNOWN I sort of figured you say, you love them because it sort of takes you back and, you know, I didn't think you'd love them because they... 

00:42:20
UNKNOWN No, because you are just a little individual. 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN More strength. 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah I seemed to get it what, you know, we've had-- because I live overseas so we have a short time together, and, ah I seem to get it right, you know, I seem to. I seemed to, ah, you know, he slept or (inaudible ) and he is very happy and his mommy and daddy went away for a couple of days, and I got it right. 

00:42:55
UNKNOWN Or this at large you got it right? 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN I did for that, you know - 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:43:00
UNKNOWN - the actual time and, ah, you know, I felt I was useful and, ah, appreciated, and, ah but it was easy, you know, it was easy enough that was a surprises as well. Easy. 

00:43:25
UNKNOWN So that mean is about to you that really surprise you. 

00:43:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:43:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:43:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, cuz I, I - 

00:43:35
UNKNOWN You're appreciated and, yeah. 

00:43:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, cuz I was always quite an anxious mom first time and, you know. 

00:43:40
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:43:40
UNKNOWN And, ah, and I mean, I wasn't. Yeah. 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN Kind of natural with this one. 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, I did it felt natural and, ah, yeah, I'm supposed I'm sad that they live sort of far away. 

00:44:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:44:10
UNKNOWN So even sort of being able to see him at, you know, ah, talk to him, talk to us involves, you know, Skype is a wonderful thing but it still, you know, you got the time log, and, and, ah. 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN Skype was wonderful but it's not the real thing. 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN No, no it's not, and if... 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN Still far away. 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN You've got a sort of talk whereas if they were there, you know, you could just me - 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN Hug. 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN - and just be, that's right, I could just, you know, like so you go out for the day and another comes the baby and. 

00:44:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:44:50
UNKNOWN And that could be my way of, you know, showing my son how much I love him as well. 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN So it would be evidence. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN That you love him as well. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. Yeah. 

00:45:15
[sil.] 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, then we got to talk about this, this, s-- I don't want you to talk about this really, I was just feeling really tired. 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. No intention really of opening this up. 

00:45:45
UNKNOWN Not really, no. 

00:45:50
UNKNOWN Only were feeling was tired. 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. And really it was clear how much, uhm, you know, upset it makes me feel still. 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, not just how upset you feel but how ups-- that, how upset it still makes you feel. 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, yeah, how I still sort of need to feel, yeah, sort of loved really. 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. You need to feel loved. 

00:46:35
[sil.] 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN No chance at that. 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN Like to what you pack and got. 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:47:10
UNKNOWN I feel sort of ashamed for you know, admitting it. 

00:47:20
UNKNOWN Shame about saying it hurt of admitting. 

00:47:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:47:20
UNKNOWN I need to be loved. 

00:47:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. You know it doesn't go in my philosophy being all you hurt, that's it cuz it's doesn't fit. You know, sort of (inaudible ) I'd have to hard work so hard on that one. 

00:47:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:47:45
UNKNOWN Oh, yeah. 

00:47:45
UNKNOWN I have to hard work so hard in that one. 

00:47:50
[sil.] 

00:47:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, put a lot of effort into that. Need sort of ought. 

00:48:05
UNKNOWN Yeah, so I had a mental picture from like Wizard of Oz, you know. I don't need to be love that actually look at person and so say, I yes I do. I do you don't have to tell me all the time, please. 

00:48:20
UNKNOWN Tell me, tell me. 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:48:25
UNKNOWN And show me. 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN Make it absolutely clear. 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, come looking for me. 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN Ah, you love me, pursue me, search me out. 

00:48:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN Let me know. 

00:48:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:48:45
UNKNOWN Don't be oblique. 

00:48:50
[sil.] 

00:48:55
UNKNOWN Just notice me. 

00:49:00
UNKNOWN Is that, is that wrong to ask that? 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN It doesn't feel wrong to me but I guess you probably think why you would say that anyway. 

00:49:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:49:25
[sil.] 

00:49:50
UNKNOWN If we stay working together Jen(ph), uhm, part of how it will be for me is that I'm constant in, uhm, in trying to demonstrate that you do matter to me and that I know now how difficult that would be for you to hear that I'm not going to-- I won't run away. 

00:50:30
[sil.] 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN And you don't have to demonstrate anything to me. 

00:50:55
[sil.] 

00:51:05
UNKNOWN I feel such pressured, you see I don't know why I should feel like I'm pressured but it does actually. 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:51:20
UNKNOWN It's the words like, uhm, yes, I want to hear what you say but actually I don't want you to bother. 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. You both wanted and you both don't wanted. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN At the same time. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN Yes, yes I do. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, it feels that so real pressure - 

00:51:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:51:35
UNKNOWN - for you. Really hard for that. 

00:51:40
UNKNOWN What I, I, I, what I don't want is that sort of sense of obligation from, you know, from you, you know. 

00:51:50
UNKNOWN When it go start that, that's important as well that you, you know, I'm not pressing this on you. It's offered freely, truly, it's offered freely and, you know, I'm not gonna expect that you will want to take this offer up. Oh, uhm, it's here if you wanted. 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:52:15
UNKNOWN It's absolutely here if you wanted. But if you don't that's alright as well. 

00:52:25
UNKNOWN It does feel strange and actually normal to, ah, to he-- you know, it does feel strange, you know, the question runs right, why she is saying that? You know, what she gonna get after that? 

00:52:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, what's my motive here? 

00:52:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, you know, what, what for? What she see that, you know, that, ah, she's making to do that? Hmm. 

00:52:55
UNKNOWN Almost what I want in return. 

00:52:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:52:55
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:53:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, and it feel, you know, is it something I can give you, cuz I might have be able to at the end of course you'll be disappointed of me. 

00:53:10
UNKNOWN Oh, are we back into that? 

00:53:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:53:15
UNKNOWN Cycle again. 

00:53:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:53:20
UNKNOWN And so we'll be here reaching you and I. 

00:53:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:53:25
[sil.] 

00:53:30
UNKNOWN So there's a part of me already thinking going next session, goodness, you know, am I gonna come back? 

00:53:35
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:53:40
UNKNOWN You know, am I gonna come back because of, you know, this-- you know, you know, I have told you this now. 

00:53:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:53:45
UNKNOWN Uhm, ah, you know, I can't shut the door in this now if I come back. 

00:53:55
UNKNOWN It's open, here it is. And what's gonna happen next time if you come back. 

00:54:05
UNKNOWN That's right, because I have told you I need, you know, I have told you what, you know, what I'm needing. 

00:54:10
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:54:10
UNKNOWN And if it had, had, ah, that just feel-- made me feel very vulnerable actually. 

00:54:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. And I can see that. 

00:54:25
[sil.] 

00:54:40
UNKNOWN It might just about the end of our time together. 

00:54:45
UNKNOWN Maybe I... 

00:54:50
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:54:55
