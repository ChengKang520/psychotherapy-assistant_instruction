MARTHA M. MANNING For me the symptoms of depression came on so insidiously. You know it’s sort of like a fog that creeps up on you. 

00:00:30
STEPHANIE HARRINGTON You push away your family and your friends and people are asking you what's wrong, what can I do and you are just saying, “Nothing, just leave me alone,” you know. 

00:00:40
KEARA DEPENBROCK I remember when I was, when my mom was depressed I was you know 11-12 and there is really very little written about depression for… for children and are very little information we had to deal with… with your children and I mean my parents had a difficult enough time and they were both therapist. 

00:00:55
BRIAN DEPENBROCK When Martha was there, she was a ghost and we both felt that, we both knew that. 

00:01:05
MARTHA M. MANNING The irony with depression is that um… you can particularly if you are used to function in it sort of high levels of functioning, you can be absolutely deathly miserable and be thinking about dying. And for at least a while maintaining this outer self that keeps going where no one picks up that you wanna die and that you are feeling more deathly ill than you’ve ever felt in your life.

THE DOCTOR IS IN 

00:02:00
JAMIE GUTH Hello I’m Jamie Guth. This program is about women and depression. Every one experiences the blues from time to time, but the lows that follow frustration or unhappiness usually pass pretty quickly. Clinical depression is different. It’s not unhappiness or anger or grief. It’s not a feeling, instead it’s a collection of symptoms that go on for an especially long period of time and affect a person’s sense of wellbeing, an ability to function in a variety of areas. 

00:02:30
MARTHA M. MANNING , PhD Psychologist, Author I think I was born you know I was sign saying, you pin a target on this one um… certainly I’ve got that family history that’s where there is lots of depression, there is lots of sense of abuse. 

00:02:45
JAMIE GUTH Martha Manning is a therapist who also suffers from severe depression. In her book, “Undercurrents” she talks about her experiences. 

00:02:55
MARTHA M. MANNING That wasn’t really until I got severe symptoms like my sleep started to really go where I would walk up earlier and earlier and earlier, so that I was at my worst. I was down to sleeping two hours a night, and for months. Umm… and that you know, I knew clinically was a hallmark sign of trouble. Umm… you know and then that feeling of slowing down like… like all of a sudden you are walking in molasses. 

00:03:30
STEPHANIE HARRINGTON Hi! How are you? 

00:03:30
Hi! How are you? 

00:03:30
STEPHANIE HARRINGTON I am fine. 

00:03:30
JAMIE GUTH Stephanie Harrington had a different experience. 

00:03:35
STEPHANIE HARRINGTON I have been having a series of health problems. You know excessive weight gain, lots of sleeping, lots of increased appetite, no motivation to do anything umm… calling into work sick, but not physically sick. Just not feeling good and I just didn’t know what was wrong with me. 

00:04:00
JAMIE GUTH With good treatment 80% to 90% of people with depression can expect significant relief. Unfortunately, nearly 2/3rds of those who suffer with this disease will not get the help they need. 

00:04:15
Clinical Depression • Affects more than 19 million in US • Women suffer twice as often as men • 42% of mothers of toddlers suffer • It is a treatable illness 

00:04:15
JAMIE GUTH More than 19 million people on the United States will experience clinical depression this year. Roughly twice as many women suffer from this disease as men and 42% of mothers of toddlers have symptoms, but depression is not a female weakness or simply a normal part of being a women. Clinical depression is an illness that can be treated. 

00:04:40
DAVID SACHER , MD US Surgeon General Not only are mental disorders and mental health problems real, they are treatable. And I think that’s the great news of this report. They are treatable. 

00:04:50
JAMIE GUTH In December 1999, the US Surgeon General released the first Surgeon General’s report on mental health. In which he defined mental disorders as diagnosable conditions that impair thinking, feeling and behavior and interfere with the person’s capacity to be productive and enjoy fulfilling relationships. 

00:05:05
Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General Department of Health and Human Services Mental Disorders Impair… Thinking Feeling Behavior Capacity to be productive and enjoy relationships 

00:05:10
DAVID SACHER A scientific revolution has taken place over the last 25 years and our understanding of mental health and mental illness and that revolution has resulted in a vast array of safe and effective options to treat mental disorders. These treatments will allow people with mental disorders to return to productive lives. 

00:05:30
Symptoms of Depression • Persistent sad, empty mood • Loss of pleasure • Restlessness, irritability, anger • Guilt, hopelessness • Difficulty concentrating 

00:05:35
JAMIE GUTH There are many symptoms of depression. The hallmark is the persistence sad, blue or empty mood. 

00:05:40
VALERIE DAVIS RASKIN , MD Psychiatrist Its not I feel depressed because I couldn’t find a parking spot, or I feel umm… sad in reaction to something. With clinical depression that mood is really umm… not related to what's happening in life. It’s not reactive… 

00:05:55
JAMIE GUTH Valerie Davis Raskin is a therapist and research psychiatrist whose practice is solely dedicated to women. 

00:06:05
VALERIE DAVIS RASKIN So umm… good things happen, you still feel blue and empty. Umm… bad things happen, you feel blue and empty. It’s a very persistent all day ever day, typically for two weeks or more of this sadness. 

00:06:20
JAMIE GUTH Other symptoms include a loss of pleasure in things that normally bring you happiness, a sense of restlessness, irritability and anger, feelings of guilt, worthlessness, helplessness or hopelessness, difficulty concentrating or making decisions. 

00:06:35
VALERIE DAVIS RASKIN My screening question for concentration is what's it like to go in to one of these mega grocery stores. When you walk in to a massive grocery store, if you have any kind of problem with concentration you have left the store without the things you went there to get. 

00:06:50
Symptoms of Depression • Changed sleep patterns • Changed appetite/weight • Low energy/fatigue • Physical symptoms • Despair, thoughts of suicide 

00:06:55
JAMIE GUTH Changes in sleep patterns either sleeping too much or too little is another sign of depression. Women may lose their appetite or over eat. Many feel low energy levels and fatigue, describing it as feeling slow down. This fatigue often leads to a loss of sex drive, ongoing headaches, digestive disorders and chronic pain can all be symptoms. In its most extreme form depression leads to thoughts of death or suicide. 

00:07:25
VALERIE DAVIS RASKIN Sometimes they are not specific like I’m gonna do X, but what I hear a lot is I go to bed and I pray that I will wake up and sometimes women are thinking very specifically about suicide. The most alarming suicidal symptom that I see is when a mother in particular begins to think that her children will be better off without her. Depression is an illness that effects how you think, it makes you hopeless and helpless and you cannot imagine feeling better again. It’s part of the illness. You cannot believe you’ll ever feel like yourself. 

00:08:05
JAMIE GUTH What is it about women that makes the more susceptible to depression? Biological differences such as hormone changes in genetics may contribute. 

00:08:15
MARTHA M. MANNING The one thing that was clear for me is that I had two very difficult miscarriages in the year and a half before that so that’s… that’s only a one vulnerability that women have around loss in pregnancy and things like that. 

00:08:30
JAMIE GUTH The menstrual cycle, pregnancy, post pregnancy, infertility, menopause and sometimes a decision not to have children, all of these things can cause fluctuations in mood, there for some women include depression. 

00:08:45
MARTHA M. MANNING What they said was you know pregnant you have a 1/3rd chance of getting worst, feeling worse. You have a 1/3rd chance of feeling better and 1/3rd chance of staying the same. But I don’t like those odds, particularly so. But it was a… that was a difficult decision in terms of knowing that should my hormonal situation change like in a pregnancy, I could be really at risk and really at risk for postpartum depression. 

00:09:10
JAMIE GUTH The postpartum period right after her baby is born is a time which triggers depression in many new mothers. 

00:09:20
ARDIS OLSON , MD Pediatrician, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Med Ctr It used to be thought that postpartum depression was limited and kind of win away and it was all gone. As people started to look at populations over time they are clearly women who remain depressed through that first year of life and into the second year of life as well. You have very big … 

00:09:35
JAMIE GUTH Ardis Olson is a pediatrician at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Her research includes recognizing and managing depression in mothers of newborns and toddlers. 

00:09:50
ARDIS OLSON So we looked at moms who are working and not working and when they came to Well-child visits between ages one and two, whether they were depressed or not. We found that 42% of mothers of toddlers had significant depressive symptoms. 

00:10:05
LAURA Frog. 

00:10:05
Frog… 

00:10:05
ARDIS OLSON In these moms, who are just living with it, sucking it up that was what life was about. 

00:10:10
JAMIE GUTH When they dug deeper Dr. Olson and her colleague discovered a direct relationship between a mother satisfaction with her role and their likelihood of being depressed. 

00:10:20
ARDIS OLSON During this time are you working or at home? 

00:10:25
JAMIE GUTH Moms who are not satisfied whether they were working mothers or not, were four times as likely to be depressed as those who were satisfied. 

00:10:35
ARDIS OLSON In addition we found that moms who are fortunate I think to have either careers or life circumstances where they could work part-time did better. They were about half as likely to be depressed. You have been home for a while with Laura right. How are you finding it? 

00:10:50
It was difficult pregnancy. 

00:10:50
ARDIS OLSON Hmm… Hmm… 

00:10:50
And I had significant postpartum depression. 

00:10:50
ARDIS OLSON Hmm… Hmm… 

00:10:55
I couldn’t stop crying and she wouldn’t stop crying and so… 

00:10:55
JAMIE GUTH Maternal depression is an important problem to treat because of its negative effects on children. 

00:11:05
ARDIS OLSON Mothers who are depressed are likely to have children, but they come and complaining about sleep troubles, behavior problems, they have higher rates of accidents. There is a whole bunch of things that trickle into the child’s health and development. 

00:11:15
JAMIE GUTH Postpartum depression is a particularly difficult problem for healthcare providers to identify because women are discharged from the hospital so quickly after giving birth. 

00:11:25
Postpartum Depression • Persistent weepiness • Insomnia • Marked anxiety • Feeling worthless • Other unusual behavior See your doctor for diagnosis and treatment 

00:11:25
JAMIE GUTH Some warning signs include persistent weepiness, insomnia, marked anxiety, feelings of worthlessness or any other unusual behavior. A family or friends see these symptoms they should encourage the new mom to see your doctor right away for diagnosis and treatment. 

00:11:45
ARDIS OLSON A lot of the treatments for new moms involve appropriate social support, appropriate help not necessarily medication, moms who have very severe postpartum depression are really a whole different groups of moms who need more intensive therapies, who may need medications. 

00:12:05
JAMIE GUTH Certainly motherhood places real stress on many women, but there are other changes in a women’s life. 

00:12:10
JAMIE GUTH Menopause has been blamed for brining on depression, but its often caused by sleep deprivation. When women are waken by hot flashes, estrogen therapy can stop those problems, but women who have had a history of depression are at risk during menopause for more depressive episodes. 

00:12:30
JAMIE GUTH Women who are victimized are also more likely to have clinical depression. Stephanie Harrington experienced physical violence and sexual abuse as a child. As a young adult she found herself in mentally abusive relationships. When she went to her doctor complaining of headaches and chronic fatigue, he couldn’t find any physical problem and asked if she was ever sexually abused. 

00:12:50
STEPHANIE HARRINGTON I (inaudible ) when he asked me that question. And I didn’t give him any answer that day, but when I had to go back for my follow up, appointment, you know I said to him, “You know why did you ask me that,” and he said well, “You know you’ve been my patient for some time now and I’ve watched you and you seem to be a classic text book case for somebody who has suffered from sexual abuse,” umm… he asked me if I would you know be opposed to go and to talk to a psychotherapist about it and you know of course you know I was very hesitant at first and if… 

00:13:30
JAMIE GUTH Why were you hesitant? 

00:13:30
STEPHANIE HARRINGTON Mm… I was hesitant for a lot of reasons. Probably first and foremost you know that whole cultural thing that you know black people don’t go and see a psychiatrist. The other issue for me was the pain of even having to remember and talk about these things. 

00:13:55
JAMIE GUTH But Stephanie did talk about them. A combination of psychotherapy with the qualified mental health professional and medications eventually enabled her to feel better and move on. 

00:14:05
STEPHANIE HARRINGTON I was just on top of the world. I mean, it was just like I was a completely different person. I was much more higher functioning then I had been. I think to have dealt with stressful situations a lot better. I did not have the crying. I didn’t have the mood swings. 

00:14:25
JAMIE GUTH Treatment for depression does work. Valerie Raskin’s book, ”When words are not enough,” provides practical and reassuring information women need to make choices about treatment options. 

00:14:35
VALERIE DAVIS RASKIN And we know very well that the best treatment for depression usually is a combination of talk therapy of psychotherapy and medication. That their combination seems to work best and sometimes talk therapy has to do with life circumstances, with stressful events, with coping skills, with trying to figure out what aspects of a person’s life she might change. 

00:15:05
Traumatic events would be much more… 

00:15:05
JAMIE GUTH Psychotherapy can help people learn better ways of handling problems. When talk therapy is not enough, medications could be very useful in managing this condition. Anti-depressant medications act on chemical pathways of the brain related to mood. 

00:15:25
VALERIE DAVIS RUSKIN The field has been revolutionized by Prozac and the medications that have followed Prozac. The term people use for that are called Novel Anti-depressants. 

00:15:35
JAMIE GUTH For most disease people expect to feel better soon after taking medication and to stop taking the drug after a short period of time, with depression medication can be a long term commitment. 

00:15:50
VALERIE DAVIS RASKIN Endurance in anti-depressants is a lag of onset. They don’t work right away. They always take a minimum of two weeks and sometimes take three, four even six weeks to kick in and we know that if people stop or even reduce the amount of medication that they are taking for depression, too soon they relapse. 

00:16:10
JAMIE GUTH The good news is that there are many different types of medications. So if the side effects of one or something you don’t want to deal with, there are others to choose from. This is important because those who choose the medication with an unmanageable side effect will often stop taking the drug, but if you get the right one you are more likely to keep taking it. Side effects include sexual problems, weight gain and sleepiness 

00:16:40
VALERIE DAVIS RASKIN That maybe that a women doesn’t really care about whether or not she has an orgasm. Is not a big deal to her. Lots of women don’t have orgasms and that’s not a big concern for her. But what would be devastating for her would be just sleep through the night when a baby woke… you know woke up and not be there or to not be able to drive car or to gain 15 pounds. That’s you know that’s… that’s really it’s got a fit her. 

00:17:00
JAMIE GUTH Anti-depressants work for approximately 60% to 70% of people who try them. Often people need to try several different medications or combinations before finding something that works. 

00:17:15
MARTHA M. MANNING I was treated for depression and anxiety in my twenties umm… with relief. For me the problem was that the meds stopped working and the psychotherapy was very useful, but I needed more and more and meds and umm… until just in terms of cardiac problems we couldn’t take the risks. 

00:17:40
JAMIE GUTH So Martha’s doctor recommended Electroconvulsive Therapy, known as ECT. This is a painless procedure performed while you sleep. 

00:17:50
You are going to go off to sleep now. 

00:17:50
JAMIE GUTH A small electrical current is delivered to the brain. This maybe recommended when medications don’t work or whether there is a high risk of suicide. Martha was dealing with both of these issues, but still hesitant to try it. 

00:18:05
BRIAN DEPENBROCK Martha’s husband Even when Martha went in to the hospital, with my own family and I’m in the field, you know again it was… well, she is having some test run, we don’t know what's going on, there is a lot of fatigue, there is a lot of… I mean, I couldn’t say the words. I mean I couldn’t… 

00:18:20
JAMIE GUTH You yourself could not say a word… 

00:18:20
BRIAN DEPENBROCK I could not say the words. I could not say that she is… she is in the psychiatric unit. Much a lot saying she is having ECT. So it was and then… in this we found as we talked to people in groups that there is so much shame still connected to this and umm… and we certainly felt it at that time. 

00:18:45
MARTHA M. MANNING I came very close to killing myself and it was… it was that bad and it really did come down to the choice for me umm… of saying yes I’ll have ECT and going to the hospital or shoot myself. And I had even convinced myself that Brian would be okay. You know but when I came to Keara, I don’t know whether it was that mother tiger part of you know that macho, I’ll stop a truck if it’s… you know that will run over my kid or the more intellectual knowledge about what it means for a kid to have a parent suicide. Either way it doesn’t really matter what would it do that was the thing. Motherhood for me was a very protective thing because it made me get help. 

00:19:45
BRIAN DEPENBROCK After one treatment was the first time I had seen her really smile and probably at least a year. I mean, really a relaxed kind of smile. 

00:19:55
MARTHA M. MANNING I knew that I was feeling better towards you know towards the third week. I knew, umm… that I just I was hungry for the first time in a long time. I knew I was sleeping. I was curious unless you feel like you are getting back, then you believe all these people who are saying you are doing better. 

00:20:20
JAMIE GUTH Martha and her family have learned how to live with her disease. Since her ECT her disease is controlled on medications and she has an act of life writing and speaking publically on depression. 

00:20:30
KEARA DEPENBROCK Martha’s daughter When she was able to articulate it is when I really start to understand that she was better now, but she had been umm… you know. 

00:20:40
JAMIE GUTH What did you think of her book when you read it? 

00:20:45
KEARA DEPENBROCK I loved it. I mean, a lot of it is stuff that conversations that we’d had, that my family has had. So all my friends joke about that I didn’t read the book very closely. And it’s so good what she did and I think it really also helped her to make peace with some of the… some of the… 

00:21:05
BRIAN DEPENBROCK For her doing clinical work I think was toxic in that she… she was a terrific therapist, but she would take on so much of the pain the people what she was seeing and to speaking intolerably I think for her. So the writing life I think suits her better and I think ironically she probably was touching a lot more lives through her writing than she ever would have done, staying as a straight clinician. 

00:21:40
[sil.] 

00:21:45
STEPHANIE HARRINGTON Now what happens when a person is clinically depressed is… it’s a whole body experience. That mean it effects the way we eat, it effects the way we sleep, it effects the way we feel about ourselves… 

00:21:55
JAMIE GUTH Stephanie Harrington has found another way to make a difference. She is now the Director of Community Relations for the Chicago Office of the National Mental Health Association where she speaks to various community groups about issues surrounding depression. 

00:22:10
STEPHANIE HARRINGTON Director of Community Relations, NMHA-Chigago I talk about it umm… specifically because the campaign that I’m involved in has targeted the African-American community and women in particular because culturally they… they have no research and studies that there is a difference in how the illness exhibits itself in some cultures. Umm… for instance with African American’s there tends to be more physical symptoms such as headaches that have no cause, digestive problems, where nothing can be pin pointed its not an ulcer, it’s not a… you know something that we ate and also because culturally as a people African Americans have not always had access to the appropriate treatments for a mental and emotional disorders and also I mention it I mean, the cultural sense because of the myth that surround going to get help for this illness. Medication is not always looked at in this culture as the healer or the cure for whatever ails you and so that’s… and that’s another reason why in this particular culture we have a lot of people who still suffer from diabetes and do not go and get the appropriate medical care and a lot of people who suffer from high cholesterol and high blood pressure and it seems it here these are some very easily identifiable illness and very treatable, if people would go and seek the appropriate care. 

00:23:55
JAMIE GUTH Stephanie works hard to de-stigmatize depression by sharing her own experiences. 

00:24:00
STEPHANIE HARRINGTON At 15 umm… I tried to take my life. I think it helps them to put a phase to what this illness really is. Most of the time they are surprised. They look at me and as with any of us you know, we are impressed by what we see on the outside first and so we would not necessarily look at a person who is appropriately dressed and hair is done and make up is done. We don’t necessarily think that’s a person who may be suffering from a mental illness. But when I do indicate that this is something that I still continue to deal with most people are shocked. Most people are shocked. 

00:24:45
JAMIE GUTH After Stephanie finishes her presentations, the school staff does confidential depression screening among the students. These types of screening tools are available free of charge from the National Mental Health Association and maybe accessed online at www.nmha.org. Nurses, counselors and social workers can use these to help young people. 

00:25:05
National Mental Health Association www.nmha.org 

00:25:10
JAMIE GUTH Reaping the benefits of treatment begins by recognizing the signs of depression. If you think you have this disease see your doctor or mental health professional. Together you can choose the treatment plan that works for you. It worked for both Martha and Stephanie. 

00:25:30
STEPHANIE HARRINGTON I feel like it’s pretty stable and I have got a good family and good friends who support me and now that this is an everyday struggle for me. I would advise anyone who has been subjected to either sexual abuse or their home life is very violent to take advantage of school nurses, social workers, principals, family friends or you know family members who can support them. 

00:26:05
MARTHA M. MANNING Probably the biggest mistake and I can’t say that I have stopped making this mistake is to try to go it alone as much as I have done. 

00:26:20
BRIAN DEPENBROCK The best thing I could just say to her was, “How can I be helpful?” and then she said you know, “Just… Just be with me.” You know, just… and I think she has even mentioned this in the book you know, “I don’t need you, I don’t want you to be my therapist. I want you to be my partner, my husband.” The irony is that probably during this period of time we’ve had some of the almost intimate of moments. Because of the sense of you know we are really connected here, I mean we are really working to try and you know still stay with each other in some sort of meaningful way during this time and I think it’s that kind of sensitive partner despite all that’s going on and still working to be with you. I think that’s a tremendously affirming statement when it comes to intimacy. 

00:27:10
KEARA DEPENBROCK Their marriage is amazing to be able to get through something like that and I mean, a lot of people comments when they read the people is your father and its true. I mean it is. 

00:27:20
MARTHA M. MANNING It was a such an isolating experience and yet it such a defining experience among the three of us that we’ve all shaped and changed by it and we have all come out on the other side. It really takes that sense of like alright, I’m… I’m going to be back in this game called life and its okay. You know what it may even be pretty good.
