 Welcome! Ah, I'm here to introduce our next speaker, Dr. Marsha Linehan. She is a person who has worked with very challenging populations. She has, uhm, addressed problems, the very few psychotherapists are willing to, to work with, or comfortable working with. And her insight and perseverance, and skill in working with very difficult populations has benefited everyone. With her attention to these more difficult populations, she has brought-- she has made a fundamental contribution to psychotherapy, and at the same time, she is the leading edge of work with difficult populations.

 So, I just want to say that I have had the privilege of seeing her work and it is a real joy to see the skill with which she presents very complex information makes it look achievable even e-- easy. And yet, when you go back and review what she's done, there is layers and layers of depth and complexity. It is my great pleasure to introduce Dr. Marsha Linehan.

DR. MARSHA LINEHAN Well, thank you so much for being here. I was worry if that what if no one shows up? Uhm, so it's always good to have someone here. I'm going to talk about my old-time favorite topic which happens to be the field of suicidology and the field of clinical research, trials to try to develop effective treatments. Uhm, and that's really what I'm gonna talk about and sort of the state of the art. Uhm, this has been, ah,-- I've been primarily in suicide most of my life, studying it. I, for many years, was the only person, and the good thing about that, it turns that, you can be the best when you're the only one. And I tell my students, I say, "This is finally an area for you. This is really nice being the best." But fortunately, we finally got in the field kind of up and running a group of us got together and experts, and try to-- try to keep it saying up and running and going. So, I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about, just sort of what the state of the art is which really what I'm talking about. 

00:02:35
Suicide • National public health problem -36.035 U.S. deaths in 2008 • 98 per day • 1.5% of total U.S. deaths -900.875 reported attempts in 2008 (in U.S.) • 10th leading cause of death in U.S. in 2008 -Increase from 11th leading cause in 2007 -National rate: 11.8 per 100,000 (CDC, 2011: SAMHSA, 2009) BRTC Behavioral Research & Therapy Clinics University of Washington Lack of Available Treatments • 52 RCTs designed to target suicidal behaviors -Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (search: "[cause of death] AND randomized" in title) • Liver disease (12th leading cause of death): 582 trials • Hypertension (13th): 1, 398 trials • Parkinson's disease (14th): 198 trials 

00:02:35
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN So, the first thing I wanna point out to you that suicide is a national public health problem. You've probably heard about this cuz we hear so much about the military suicides there. But really, it's endemic, ah, across our country. Ah, there are 98 suicides per day, uhm, and, uhm, it's 1.5% total of all the deaths. But most importantly, ah, it's the attempts leading cause of death in the United State in 2008, and that tends to go up by a point-- not-- it has never really gone down much, but it does go up and down somewhat. Uhm, and, uhm, so, you would think that if you have the 10th leading cause of death in United States, you would have a lot of research. However, the facts are-- there only 52 randomized clinical trials that have been conducted targeting suicidal behavior. Now, ah,-- and that's looking at the Cochrane Central data-- ah, Central, ah, Register of Controlled Trials and, ah, and they are sort of the, the major players in selecting trials, ah, that are, ah, at, at the level that you can actually look at some. Now, liver disease, which happens to be the 12th leading cause of death than have too many ether, only got 582. But hypertension, which is the 13th, has 1, 398 trials. And Parkinson's disease, the 14th, has 198. So, suicide, which is really a much greater leading cause of death in the other group, has very few clinical trials which is so interesting, or by itself. Because we have very-- almost no research that would tell us what to do. Fortunately, we have research telling you what's useless to do, and I'm gonna tell you about that too, because that's the most important we have found out. So most of work, people think you should do, there's no evidence, or whatsoever, that's effective. 

00:04:40
DO WE NEED RCTs? Percent Eventual Suicide of Persons at High Risk for Suicide Who Obtain Treatment vs. Refuse Treatment % Suicide 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 Treatment No Treatment 2.7 1.7 4.9 3.2 7 4.4 10.2 6.8 1 2 3 4 Years at risk Motto (1976) 

00:04:40
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN So, the first thing, I heard a rumor here that some people have said that randomized clinical trials are just stuff that, us, researchers liked, and that they're really not necessary or important. So, I'm pretty clear that lot of people seem to think that way so I just want to tell you that if you also believe that what the implications of that would be for you. And that is a study that looked at the percent of eventual suicides of people at high risk for suicide who got treatment versus those who didn't get treatment. Now, as you can look at this right now, it seems utterly clear therefore that treatment is iatrogenic, and that people who go to treatment are much more suicidal-- get, or killed themselves more often than people who don't. And that would suggest that this is we should start thinking about whether we should continue to have suicidal people go to psychotherapy. Because clearly, more of them killed themselves, and the people who didn't go to treatment did a lot better than the ones who did. Now, if you don't believe in-- and you can have it both ways. You can't say, when I like the outcomes, we'll agree with them, but we-- if we don't like these outcomes and we have another reasons for it, we'll say that people who went to therapy here were more serious than the others. But you can't-- so therefore, we're not counting the study. But you, you know, you can't do, you can't-- you can't make up your own rules and say, when we like the outcomes we believe, and then, when we doubt, we don't. So, if you don't want to say that therapy causes suicide, now, mentally, you'd have to replicate this, we're like guarantee, probably, could, you'd have to replicate that. Then, you have to be in favor of randomization because without randomization you can't really make any causal statement, whatsoever, about what is working, or what is not working. And having a causal st-- being able to make a causal statement, that a treatment either does or does not work, is important. Because it's the only way you can decide what treatments to give people. Cuz this would suggest that the treatment to give suicidal people is no treatment. I don't think any of us-- I, I don't know how many of you agree with that, but I don't, myself. 

00:07:10
Methodological Problems to Date • Lack of operational definitions • Infrequent use of validated measures • Infrequent use of blind assessment • Exclusion of high risk suicidal subjects Operational Definitions • Common language is necessary to interpret and replicate findings • 28 (54%) trials included at least one definition -24 (46%) trials included no definitions • 18 identified target outcomes across all trials 

00:07:10
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN Now, the methodological problems in this area, I realize that a lot of you aren't researchers, but I'm gonna talk a-- point out to you the problems with the research. Okay? The methodological problems to date are nothing short of amazing. For one, the research don't have operational definitions. Is that means that people treat suicidal behavior without ever telling you what they are talking about what they mean? I actually had to study once where they said, "We have five-- we have 15 people attempted suicide, but, uhm, a lot of them didn't wanna die." Then, you have to ask yourself, "What is that? If you don't wanna die, how could you attempt suicide? How can you go something, a suicide attempt, if you didn't wanna die?" Uhm, I hope this isn't going by itself that appears to be. It is. Okay. So, I'm gonna look at-- okay. I did not do this. Okay. This is-- my graduate students who did this, probably to make me go fast. Okay. A common language is that-- or, the reason you have to have definitions of things when you do research-- and I, you know, I've-- have my workshop the other day on DBT. I was really saying to the audience that you-- we need-- we, the researcher-- we, the academics, we now need the clinicians in the world, start doing research, start collecting data to start measuring outcomes, to start describing what you're doing. And we are not gonna be able to advance the field by just having the academics doing all this research, we need you. And so, one of-- these were things that you need to think about in your clinical practice, when you start collecting data. And the first thing is, is that you have to have a language, you have to have a description or definition of what it is you're treating and what it is you're measuring. And in the field of suicide, 54%-- only 54% of the trials included at least one definition of the behavior, and, uhm, and only 18 people out of the 56 identify what the outcomes were. So, the point thing is that, if we're-- if you're measuring something one way and someone else is measuring in another, someone else is measuring in another, then, we can't tell what we're measuring, and if you don't know what you're measuring, you don't know what effect you had in your research. So, for those of you in clinical practice, you're gonna, one, to be looking at, uhm, measures that clearly define outcomes that you clearly interested and having an effect on. So, I'm not really making argument for what outcome you should have and making an ar-- an argument that you should be able to state what the outcome is, specific way, so that someone else could replicate it if they wanted to. So, this is what we're trying to get across really to everybody. 

00:10:00
Suicide Suicide completion Suicide attempt Suicidal behavior Parasuicide deliberate self-harm Self-harm Deliberate self-poisoning Intentional self-poisoning Self-poisoning suicide ideation Suicide ideation intent Suicide intent Suicide event Self-destructive behavior Self-injury Non-suicidal self-injury Self-mutilating behavior Operational Definitions • 18 terms • 34 total definitions • 4 definitions repeated in multiple trials Validated Measures • Reliability and validity are necessary -Reliability: Are scores reproducible and consistent? -Validity: Does the assessment measure what you think it does? • Psychometrically sound measures exist -Suicide Attempt-Self-injury Interview (Linehan et al, 2006) -Scale for Suicide Ideation (Beck et al, 1979) -Modified Scale for Suicide Ideation (Miller et al, 1986) • 13 trials (25%) used published measures with demonstrated reliability and validity 

00:10:05
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN Uhm, there are 34-- we found 34 definitions of suicide attempt and suicide in literature. You would never think that, right? Who would think they're gonna be 34 different definitions? But turns out that they are, okay? And, uhm, only four of the definitions were repeated in multiple trials. In other words, every trial has its own definition of suicide. The other problem is, people don't use measures that are validated, validated-- you know, I don't know what's-- I'm sorry about this group, I'll just-- okay. They don't use, ah, validated measures. Now, a validated measure is one that if you do it and another person measures the same thing and the same person, they come up the same answer. So, if you're gonna do research in your clinical practices and, and in your research studies, etcetera, you have to have reliable measurement. So no science can advance without that. And reliable measurement mean that if two people measure the same thing, they come up with the same answer. And it turns out that our field, in the field of suicide, does not the field of treatment research, per se, which is actually very strong, is specific quite frankly to the, the research and suicide which is primarily not being done by people in aca-- ba-- with research backgrounds for the most part. So, reliability is really important. That means really that you can simply get two people to say the same thing, okay? But the other thing you have to do is know that is valid. In other words, is it measuring what you think is measuring, okay? So, for example, we have found in our research that if you just ask people, "Did you attempt suicide, did you enga-- engage in self-injury," for example. Then, you get a number four higher than if you actually explore whether they actually intended to die or not, whether they actually attempted to harm themselves or not. In other words, when you explore what they mean by a suicide attempt, you suddenly find that people cause suicide attempts practically anything, you know, if I harmed myself, it's just suicide attempt. And so in other word, you want to be sure that you're really measuring what you think you're measuring, but in our field of suicide, this is not been abided by in the field itself. Uhm, only 25% of those clinical trials used published measures with demonstrated reliability and validity. Now, for those of you interested in clinical researching your program or in suicide research, you can find-- their loads are free, really good measures that are free, that you can get your hands on, that are-- have been published, are reliable and valid. So, these are things that are very findable. As long as you find somebody who's doing research in the area you're interested in. However, it is not been followed in the field of suicide. This means you can interpret the results of many of the studies. So, it means that if we had a lot of research, not a lot with what we've had, but we don't know what it means. 

00:13:10
Non-validated Data Collection Methods 14 12 10 5 6 4 2 0 13 9 7 4 1 12 Med record Subject report Idiosyncratic MD quest One item Unknown 

00:13:10
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN Uhm, and the biggest problem is with, uhm, subject self-report. But people get medical record, self-report is encratic that means that we can't figure out what-- where they got the information. They call a physician and ask them if the person try to kill themselves. There only have one item, or it's unclear completely. I review a lot of grants for the national survey of mental health. And it's stunning how many people decided to exclude suicide without describing how they knew the person with suicidal, and so you have no idea who's now being excluded from the research studies that are being done. So that's also a major problem. The other problem is the infrequent use of blind assessment. So, there are two things that are really important in looking at clinical trials of treatment to see whether the treatments are effective and the person who did that, ah, used good strategies. One of them is you have to have blind assessment. We know that expectations change outcomes. If you believe, something's gonna work and you know which, which, which treatment the person is getting, you're likely to skew your answers towards what you believe even though you do it without any awareness, or whatsoever, okay? So, even in, in clinical work that you're doing, uhm, which you're doing in private practice, which many of-- I think the people in the room, probably are. You gonna have-- you wonder your biggest promise how to solve the blind assessment problem, and that apprehends where you have to develop methods, ah, in these situations where you get your colleagues, someone who is not treating the patient, to be looking at the outcomes for you. But in research, it's required. Mainly cuz we know there's a complete bias, okay, in that expectations. Ex-- expectations are stunningly effective. The placebo effect lives. So, a lot of them are not that. 

00:15:05

00:15:05
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN And it prevents bias, prevents allegiance, and only 41% of the clinical trials have blind assessment. For those of you in here, who know evidence-based treatment, who read research solution and treatment, you now know how really problematic this research is. And you've got to remember that if you-- without really good research, you can't say something evidence-based, and without being the same as evidence-based, you really don't know whether it's effective or not. That doesn't mean it's not effective, which is means, you don't know. The worst part of the whole field, you're not gonna believe this, but people who do suicidal research often exclude high risk for suicidal people. We can-- right, uhm, we got to think about this for a moment and think this is a problem. Okay? Suicidal people though, uhm,-- suicidal people are like pregnant women. They can't get into research and we don't know how to treat them. And so they're being excluded, they're actually excluded in a lot of universities now. I have colleagues who's university said that they would not allow them cuz it was too high risk. University of Washington has already told me multiple times that I am the highest risk research at the whole university including the medical school, or cancer and everything else. I am the highest risk person. But they have let me there. And the reason is, is there's a real ethical problem to keeping suicidal people out of research. In the same way, there's another problem about not knowing how to treat women and is, is that we end up with the group of people that we don't know what to do with. No one knows how to treat them. And so-- ah, is a major problem. Uhm, 35% of the suicide clinical trials excluded high risk for suicidal people, I finally sort of blows my mind, myself. How do they define that? They're need of psychiatric treatments, that means to have a mental health, or they're in need of inpatient hospitalization, not that there's any criteria, or whatsoever, for knowing that someone needs inpatient hospitalization, and we'll talk about that in a minute. They've been diagnosed with the mental disorder whoever heard of that, okay? Or they need immediate treatment for suicidality, and the point I'm gonna make here, we have absolutely no research, whatsoever that would tell you, empirically, there's no data to tell you when somebody needs hospitalization. Ah, you're-- oh, which you're actually gonna find out there's no data that shows hospitalization is effective in anyway, whatsoever. In other words, there's no data state anyone ever needs hospitalization. We'll get to that. So, the typical language for exclusion are suicidal individuals at imminent risk, high suicide ideation in need of urgent treatment, they give no rationale, they give no description of criteria used, and it destroys our ability to know what treatments work for who. So eit-- you know, I hope I'm not forcing you too much, I guess, a little better as we go. The thing we do now is that when you take high risk for suicidal people, you have a much greater probability of therapy being effective, being more effective than no therapy, being more effective than treatment as usual and being more effective than, ah, weighing much control. So, the main point is, little risk people is possible that they are much more likely to get better with almost anything, and you don't really need these specialized treatments that are aimed-- specialized interventions for suicide itself. That's kinda good to know. So what we need here is simple better methodology. We need definitions, sound assessments, blind assessment, inclusion of high risk subjects. So these are the problems with the area. Now, what do we have by way of treatment? So, of our 53, or 53, 53 studies, what have we found out? I-- we have found out a lot, but, ah, but not-- but it hasn't advanced as very far. This is what we found out. There are only-- there are two of six pharmacotherapy trials that have been done. Okay? May two out of six pharmacotherapy trials have been done, two of them show reduction and suicidality in the medication. One of them is never-- neither one of them that ever been replicated. Okay? If the treatment is not replicated, you cannot call it evidence-based, in just in case you didn't know that. Because it's very easy by chance in one study to get a result. So, you have to have things replicated. So, on-- so, pharmacotherapy, in one of those trials, uhm, was compared to another treatment that there's reason to believe mind itself be making people worse. So, in other words, you don't know whether your treatment made him better or the other one, made him worse. So, these things have to be replicate-- so we have no pharma conclusion, not one single pharmacotherapy drug out there that is known to reduce suicide, just in case you thought they're worst, there isn't, there's a zero data, for any of them. And they-- one of the biggest fears of everybody was that everyone absolutely believe lyceum was needed. So no one would research it and federal government would-- and the survey is too high risk. I don't know, if the federal government said, I think the researcher said, it's too high risk to take every single way from by which is bound that they gonna all kill themselves. But it's turned out, that study of this, uhm, in comparative to another medication, and it's no more effective. So, in other words, we don't have a pharmacotherapy that is known to reduce suicide. I-- if we have time, I'll give you a lot of data on that. Second, we have two hospitalization trials. These are two trials where people, uhm, randomly hospitalize one group, didn't hospitalize the other, and there is no difference, or whatsoever, in suicidal behavior. In other words, it's zero, zero, zero data, not this latest bit of data, but putting your person hospitalize ever kept any by your life, or an extra five minutes. Okay? And even-- and, and just think of the ethics of this, we take away people's freedom because we believe hospitalization will give them lot. We take away their freedom and that's enough. And what can only be thought of it is jails and hospitals. It's their very equivalent to jails and hospitals, and we don't let them out under the expert opinion that somehow this is an effective intervention. Even though, there only two trials, and neither trial showed that it was effective. So, it's just a belief. And the courts have sustained it which doesn't-- would quite make sense to me why that would sustain. And you can tell him, very opposed to this. Uhm, we have two, ah, trials of various inpatient treatments, neither one of them were more effective and controls, but that just one of them was behavioral and it wasn't better than a non-behavioral, I think, there are two-- but look, and-- you know, so neither one-- both have-- two of them have behavioral interventions compared to non-behavioral, they were not better, so. Now, there's a very interesting research on-- it was called the green card. This is a treatment where you say to people, you don't have to be suicidal to get it-- to get treatment in the emergency run. Okay? And so what they did was-- and particularly with kids, if a kid came in, they were suicidal, they got this green card and the green card meant that suicidal or not, if they came back and show their green card, they get a treatment. And the first one that was done was very-- lot very effective. So everybody thought, "Wow, too fabulous." We've gone very sound theoretically and saying that, you know, taking away the reinforcements for suicidal behaviors. So actually, everybody thought it was just defined except that nobody spin over the replicated. So that it's just okay, maybe that's not an effective treatment. Uhm, the next one-- oh, this is my old-time favorite. Oh, I may have said that on all over so far, but this really is my favorite. Okay, This one is the continuity of care trial. So, this was based on the idea that if people were in a hospital for suicidal behavior, then they left, that they would do better if they get continue to see the inpatient psychiatrist that they'd had. So, they decided to study if that was true. So, what they did was they, they, they put them in and then, what else, they, uhm,-- half of them went to a suicide crisis clinic, and half of them continue to see the inpatient psychiatrist for therapy. Not only did see inpa-- patient psy-- psychiatrist, not work, but what-- there had significantly more suicide attempts in the other group. Now, my take-home on this, I'll talk about it later, is that what we're looking at is that expertise and the treatment is, suicide is probably very important. And, uhm, uhm, there's almost no requirement in the United States, in any training programs including psychiatrist, psychology, social work, mental health, mental council, etcetera. There's actually no real training in how to treat effectively suicidal behavior. And the requirements that do exist are things like six hours, and no one's gonna learn what you need to learn about suicidality and the treatment of it in six hours. Now, this is their replicated intervention. This is two colorful words, I wanna suggest-- I got to make sure this isn't go anywhere. Make-- ah, there's-- there's unbelievable data. And uhm-- I gotta hold up talking about it, cuz I have another set of slides that I have got to. So, I'm gonna-- we'll try to get there cuz I'm gonna try to get everyone in the room to do this treatment. I'm gonna talk about some of these later. The only other treatment has been replicated and still we can. So, there only two approaches to treatment that happen replicated. And both have been replicated in independent trials which is where here required to do to be able to call yourself it, and evidence-based treatment as you have to have independent people. So they don't have too much bias. So, uhm, so those were only two. What it means is they are-- ah, we have 39% of the treatments had their experimental condition doing better than control. But only 2% have been replicated. This doesn't mean that ones that aren't replicated, aren't good, that's not the point. The point is, is that, we, or the people who will replicate the trials. Now, lot of these, they have not been able to replicate as you can see, two or four, three of nine, two of nine, one of three. So, that they often get something that everyone is excited about and then no one can replicate it afterwards. So, that's obviously a real problem cuz how could you use that-- so, the pharmacotherapy trials are these. And 2.6 was just a second one by Montgomery. It was done on 1979. And it is, ah, significant finding, it was a well-significant finding, and no one's replicated so I've-- I just crossed that up of any list because if-- from 1979 you haven't replicated it, there's no point in thinking about it. The clozapine was looked-- compared to olanzapine. I did a research study with olanzapine where we have significantly slower reduction and suicidology in olanzapine that with the-- uhm, with the placebo. And there are other people who think that, that's not significant, it was a trend. But, uhm, there is-- ah, other people think it's possible that we have some medications than increased suicidology, we know that in adolescence that we've got medications, and you've got, ah, the box, ah, you know, the black box on the pills that the evidence is what they in fact increasing. What's really amazing is even though it's true, they're wildly prescribe anyway. So, there's a real belief in the field that medication was over, problem was suicide and with-- in the absence of many evidence, and in fact, that does that. It was the hospitalization what I'm sort of going over them a little bit more, but that's the one I told you about. There's the green card, uhm, and the really the, the promise that was done with adolescents and, uhm, the problem issue that it doesn't work. My, my own opinion is that it-- we ought to try more. Mainly, cuz the theory underlying is so strong, that if you let people get help with that'll be-- ah, having to be suicidal is possible that you could get that to work, if people played around with it, ah, a little bit maybe mismodifications to that. This is the basis of DBT strategy which is, you don't have to be suicidal to call your therapist and we never say things get worse, call us, you know, or if you get suicidal call, we say call if you need help, if you need coaching for any reason or whatsoever. And in fact, in DBT, for person who harms themselves or attempt suicide, they cannot call their therapist for 24 hours. If they do call in that 24 hours, we do nothing more than a medical check on risk of whether they need medical treatment or not, and that's it. And we, then, make sure they get their medical treatment. Uhm, and you know, DBTs have been a very effective treatment. Uhm, there's the continuity of care, I told you about that already. Now, this is really some of the most exciting research out, and why this is not, uhm, been disseminated is just beyond me. This was done by Jerry Motto in 1976 and it has been replicated. So now, I wanna tell you what it is and I want to very much suggest that you follow through with this. What they did or what Motto did, was he took people leaving the hospital, who were in the hospital for major depression of suicidal, both of them, and when they left, the people who do not go to treatment-- remember, there's a whole group of people that didn't get into treatment, he sent them caring letters once a month. And these letters were think they were non-demanding caring letters saying, "Hi, how are you? I'm thinking of you," and things like that. Okay? N ow, then, he said, "If you would like to write back you can," and the next time he wrote letter to him, he reminded them with that letter. Okay? Overtime, during the time that they were sending the letters, they had significantly fewer suicides than the group who did not get letters. Okay? So on this study, I know, ah, that's actually reduce death by suicide. This was simply short caring letters. Then, Carter in 2007-- in 2005 and 2007, decided to try that again. And he sent caring postcards and he got postcards that had little dogs on them. And they printed them on their computer saying, "Hi, how are you? We're thinking of you," and sweet things like that. Since those are on a regular basis and sure enough, the incidence of suicide attempts and self-injuries went down. I think they've had trouble, ah, replicating that again so it's not quite a strong. But if, uhm, uhm,-- but it has-- it's been replicated, but it's not clear how much you need to send. They've had a lot of work using phone calls and it appears that ke-- keeping in touch with people by phone call. So, what is this all about? It's about expressing caring for another person with no demand that they respond to you. So, the other reason DBT maybe good-- I hate to say this but it's true, is this, we sent every year a Christmas card. I've already signed, I think about eight or 900 Christmas cards this year. We send them to every person who's ever been in our clinic, every single year. And for people and treatment, we send not only cards but we send birthday cards and sorry you're sick cards, and also things like that. In other words, we do a lot of caring letters where we demand absolutely nothing. We just say, thinking of you, might this year-- might, I said, we're thinking of you. And that's how we send, and or-- and, uhm, first, the people I know personally, I'd like to hear-- love to hear from you. So, the question is, is this seems to be, ah, or, you know, cross- multiple type studies, really the strongest, next to DBT, the next strongest interven-- whereas, just strong or maybe stronger than DBT. This is the easy thing you're ever going to do. Okay? You take the clients and when they leave, you just put them on some rotating system of where you send them something, not necessarily every month, but where you send them a card or send them a letter, or send them something, and the people knew that the one from Carter was that, they said, "Yeah, we knew that you'd print it out on the computer and all that, but we still love getting it anyway." So that, you know, computerization, I guess, in that group is gonna say this all. And so, you know, if you just get little postcards, put something cute on it and start sending them out. And you signed them and you don't-- you know, it's not a lot of work. So, I maybe the most-- one of the most important, do you now know what lives you may save if you start sending this? The trick is not stop, that is your problem. The reason we're still sending them after 20 years is that when Motto quit sending them, then the suicide raise leveled up. And so I thought, "Wait a minute, we can't do that. I can't send them a key in my life for a short period of time, and you need to get them alive for a long period of time." So that's why every year, I have more cards on. So, okay. Uhm, there was all sorts of other treatments that been looked out. The real problem with all of them is they haven't been, ah, replicated and have been replicated by independent people. Ah, many of them have-- didn't have blind assessments as great of good to know, you can't really trust an outcome, ah, without that. So, uhm, and so many of them were so proud we've have a million promising ones, they come up, you're so excited, they go, yey, we've got a new treatment, are you ready-- are ready to do that. They start doing it as everybody were saying, "Here's the treatment to do." And the next thing we find is the next study found, you know, either it didn't work, or was worse than the control condition. So, this is why you want to be looking for replication, replication, replication. Ah, so, what I wanna talk about now is looking just the DBT which no one thi-- everyone thinks is effective. I wanna talk about what about-- what component of this treatment might be the reason and I wanna-- have you ever thinking about how-- what-- ah, which of these components are gonna be important to you in your treatment. All right? So, the first is, we reduce excessive medications. So when a client comes into DBT, we check their medications, many of them are on multiple medications. You've got to remember the two effective treatments put together do not able an effective treatment. They will-- ah, and stand your treatment that we know nothing about. They have no data. It's not evidence-based anymore. And with pharmacotherapy in particular, there's no evidence for probably pharmacy, very little, like one study that I know. And so, what we do is we have them go to their, ah, provider, whoever, ah, or either nurse or physician. And have them, ah, have their medication check. We really asked to see if you can get a lot of the polypharmacy taper and start all over again going up with what exactly you might need. Okay? And so, what we have found about suicidal people and research study, for example, you cannot tell them to go aftermath by-- you know, at all because they're afraid they're gonna kill themselves, they believe in the medication. And since, I believe in the placebo fact, I'm definitely not gonna take some after medication. But trying to get them-- to, to get them more reasonable, you know, to go from polypharmacy to having someone really evaluated can be very important and we always do that. The other thing we do is we immediately have the patients talk with their physician or nurse, whoever, precisely, for them that they can't have lethal drugs. Now, you may think that lot of people think that if a person wants to kill themselves, they'll just do it. This is nothing could be further from the church. If you can get rid of mean, so that if a person doesn't have access to mean, you can't stop a suicide. Uhm, the second thing that DBT does is, is not that we never hospitalize cuz occasionally, I will, but it's rare. But we have way put down the emphasis on hospitalization. I am now, uhm, thinking that is possible hospitalization itself is iatrogenic as opposed to being therapeutic. Suicides are number one, ah, cause of death on psychiatric inpatient here. Uhm, the very highest risk for suicide is living, is when you get out on one of these places, a lot of people think-- well, that meant that, you know, you are so suicidal and you went it, and that's why you're high bit as possible to your highly suicidal because you are in there. Ah, for one way, you go-- when you leave your job, you leave school, you leave your family, but also, I really started looking at why and all of our studies in DBT. We have control conditions who hospitalize a lot where-- we have 73% less hospitalization of DBT. And yet, we have also a lot less suicidal behavior so I started thinking, it could be that the communication of hospitalizing a patient is I can't treat you. You're too serious for me. So, it's possible that you've-- you've-- is, there's an abandonment issue not exactly being at least with my analyst friends would say, but they could be right, you know. And that is either abandonment or is the message of you're too serious for me, which is not a good message to ever give a client. So I think, ah, I don't think that what you get on in inpatient in that is necessarily problematic. The next one is suicide expertise. I can't recommend too highly to people in the room, that if you're going to treat suicidal people which I hope that you will, that you get expertise and their treatment of it. We are developing at, uhm, University of Washington and at a, uhm, ah, company that are young, uhm, a suicide safety net. And while I'm thinking about a company that I own. I realize that I don't have all my conflicts of interest on here so let me just take a break and tell you what they are, so. Ah, first of all, I got paid to give this talk. Uhm, secondly, ah, I own a company that develops, uhm, uhm, safety net, things for suicidal behavior. Third, I get research grants that, ah, pay for my research, and, of course, if your research comes out good, you'll get more money. So, that's always a conflict. I get paid for workshops all over the world on suicide. So in other words, you should take with somewhat of grain of salt that's what I have said. You know, there's always a bias when you're making money. And there's no good way to get money out of research, but at least you need to know what it is. So that you'd have your risk assessment in management protocol. It's a protocol that you can get now for free on my website at the University of Washington. And, uhm, it's a checklist designed to have therapist use the checklist, and it's designed to sort of say that they get you to do high quality evidence-based treatment. And it's also designed to reduce your fear being said. Because it is set up in such a way that it's-- after you do your risk assessment, it then ask you what you-- what you did for treatment, and it says, did you do this? If you say yes, you'll go to the next question, if you say no, it says, why not. Then, it gives you all the good reasons for not doing what you didn't do. So, whole thing set up is sort of make force you to justify what's you're doing. So, checklist which we know makes people more effective and it's also set up to help you justify your decision making. And so, it's-- it's organized around that and we're developing one now to be online and all that kind of stuff, but in the meantime you can get a free one, uhm, at my, ah, website which I tell you about by the end of this. Uhm, the other thing that, uhm, could be stopping suicide is skills-focused. There's a problem solving treatment that hadn't been replicated, but had fabulous, really fabulous results. And what is problem solving, but teaching people the skill of how to problem solve is what it was. And so skills teach people how to solve the basic problems that they have. They're gonna push some problems there, motion regulation problems, distress tolerance problems, and there's a lot-- so, there're evidence that just skills training are selflessness or-- uhm, remember, you always have to remember suicide is a problem for the therapist, but it is a solution for the client. So, you have to remember that. And so, if you teach them adequate skills, adequate problem solving, you don't need DBT, problem solving, skills training, but you do need skills training. There is a research that I've done that also has been replicated that shows there are two kinds of problem solving, there's active problem solving and passive problem solving. So, passive problem solving is when you're very good in solving problems by getting other people to do it for you. And active problem solving is when you're very good in solving problems by doing it yourself. Okay? And the research is that people with passive problem solving are much more likely to attempt suicide than the people with active. And this is a teachable skill, to teach people how the problem solve. There are a lot of really good problem solving books out there, uhm, not problem solve-- yeah, problem solving, ah, books. The other thing that maybe working is just that, that when, when you have manualized treatment-- I think, I'm gonna skip that for a moment, but you may not know this but the research is that people do manualized treatments have better outcomes than people who don't. Part of the reason is when you don't have a manualized treatment, you start slipping away from the treatment, you start doing whatever the client feels like doing. They've done some research and their standard treatment as usual, ah, which without a manual and found that large proportion of its total had nothing to do with therapy, discussing baseball games and which awarded the prom, and stuff like that. Uhm, the other thing that I think is important to DBT that you could replicate without doing DBT. I'm really trying to give you things you could do without doing DBT, which is 24/7 access to coaching. Now, I just want to tell you something about this. Everyone thinks, "Oh, I don't wanna do DBT, I wanna take phone calls." Every single expert I have talked to in the field of suicide takes phone calls. I never met one-- and they don't do DBT, and they do their own treatment. But they all take phone calls. So, there's no one who treats highly suicidal people done take phone calls. There would be like a pediatrician saying they weren't gonna take a call. And pediatrician takes them as I keep telling my students when they play about this, they say, "What's wrong? Pediatricians take them. Look at all the other people that take off." I have a guy who's in charge of, uhm,-- in Seattle, of all the people who clean that, you know, and they have water overflows and stuff like that, and he's in charge of making sure someone goes out and gets the water working, who oscillates with this pe-- to group every time. You know, because its on-call 24/7 on that. In other words, psychotherapist, we seem have this idea that somehow, we shouldn't-- don't need to take all that group, but we, you know, we want our electrician to call it, come when we need them. We want people to fix the phones, you know, when the phones go out, and this is really no different, and I say, "I wanna make an argument to you." This is part of the job. Part of the job is being a fail book when needed, and I guarantee, you'd rather talk to your client then go to the more. And I've had to go to funeral clients, and I tell you, it's not any problem. So, okay.

00:45:35
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN Making mistakes are usually made which was I outlined my talk, and then, I have my talk all set up. And I then gave the talk on the outline. So, I'm gonna skip some things here. And, uhm, I'm gonna give you some of the medication data. So, these are the some big round-- big, uhm, examinations of pooled data that the federal government had. So this is looking at 17 anti-depressant RCTs with 3, 065 patients. Now, you can see that the, ah, lowest number of, uhm,-- cuz I think, with suicide attempts-- could have been suicide, the lowest number was the placebo, and the highest was the people who got anti-depressants. However that was not significantly different, and that's important to keep in mind when something is not significantly different that means if you did the research again, it could go the other way. So, even though they look different, you can't think they are different. Okay. But it does say, there's no evidence that anti-depressants reduce suicide behavior. There's another study of the same thing where they looked at anti-depressants, there's no evidence that anti-depressants reduce suicide behavior. There's another one. These are all, you know, 23,000 people. This one was 10,000 people. These are huge studies. Not showing-- no effect of pharmacotherapy. This is important to keep in mind. This is one looking at rates, uhm, for, for suicide and attempted suicide, and this is looking anti-psychotic medication. And what you'll find here also is that the lowest rates most of the time are-- is either-- is either the, ah, for suicide attempts that see, you know, psychotics and there's no significant difference on suicide. So, there's no evidence whatsoever that medication is going to save your client, but doesn't mean it won't treat a lot of other things. It's just that if you want to treat suicide, you have to treat suicide and you have to treat the cause and factor of suicide. And the fact that the person has a mental disorder does not necessarily mean the mental disorder itself is the cause or factor, it could be something else. This is the data for DBT, uhm, which has said that, that compared to expert therapists, reduce suicide attempts by 50% and ER inpatient. So with that says about inpatient is that we've been able across studies to reduce suicidal behavior and also not hospitalize. So, what I'm trying to help you do is think about the nature reaction of expert opinion usually that you should hospitalize. But even worse and I do have to tell you this, I know a lot of people have been sued for not hospitalizing. So, we have a culture that is acting like you could-- you could be sued and lose a lot of money for not engaging in the treatment that has no date or whatsoever that it was. And the mental health communities as a whole is going to have to rise up as one to get extra change. This are, uhm,-- I think I'm going to end there. Uhm, I have other things to say but I think this, with my most important things, was to reassure you that there's no data for these treatments, uhm, that's you're feel compelled to give but also to tell you that we all have to rise up. But I hope I gave you some ideas and what I'd like to do even though it's an invited address is see if there's any question or comment, I could take one or two. 

00:49:50
[sil.] 

00:50:00
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN Yes. 

00:50:00
 Yeah. I just like to mention a resource as a follow up. Ah, there is an American suicide association and a conference on suicide, and add to that, some professionals have formed a Yahoo group for therapists who will be there, experience, there's, ah, suicide of a client or in their own network, and that group connects around research and around conversations. One of the most that's fascinating one lately was, ah, one, ah, therapist who would had a suicide of a client and she felt 50% of the-- her fellow clinicians had no empathy or understanding for the circumstance in the people. 

00:50:35
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN Well, thank you. 

00:50:35
 We would like to know that if you'll give me your card. 

00:50:40
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN Thank you. 

00:50:40
 I'll give you the contact. Thank you. 

00:50:40
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. Thank you. Yes? 

00:50:45
 Well, I'm, I'm curious about, uhm,-- I don't know if I believe this but it's-- it's more of, uhm, ethical concern, do you have any ethical concern about the cards that you send, you ask permission cuz I can see risk management person, just freaking out about the confidentiality of getting the card with... 

00:51:05
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN First of all, I send them an envelope that has no-- that will have a compliant, whatever the word, have a compliant group for it. And so, there's nothing on it that would make anybody think it can-- whereas, in the card, I send of an envelope. And envelope has no identifying information. 

00:51:20
 Okay. 

00:51:20
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN So, and, uhm,-- yeah. 

00:51:25
 Okay. Thanks. 

00:51:25
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN So, I mean, we-- you have to follow of all this stuff. Is there someone over there? 

00:51:30
 What's your website? 

00:51:30
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. My website is, uhm,-- if you look up, ah,-- BRTC in Google, and then you-- and put my name next to it, Linehan, you should find my website. And then you go into assessments and that's where it is. This has been told, you're looking for the suicide, ah, risk assessment and management, and it's there and it's free. Yes? 

00:52:05
 So, in speaking-- in speaking to the, ah, concern about risk management with suicidology, and as you mentioned, ah, people are used successfully for not hospitalizing patients who report suicide litigation. Ah, how do you negotiate that then, ah, without being sued? 

00:52:25
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN Okay. I'll tell you, I'll tell you, I'll tell you, okay? Generally, they are not really sued for that, they're sued for not having good enough, and not justifying it. And our whole thing is aimed that justifying not putting people in the hospital, okay? And all I can tell you-- and this is just what I've been told by the forensic people have told me that if anybody used our system that's in my-- on my website, they can get for free, if you filled that out, the chances that you would be sued or almost nothing, because in general, if you're not gonna hospitalize, you simply have to have a good reason for it, a good clinical reason. And I've listed all the really good reasons on there. 

00:53:00
 And I notice on that when I looked it up last night actually, ah, that there aren't necessarily certain criteria in terms of numbers of symptoms that you have to do in order to do it. It is just demonstrate... 

00:53:10
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN There's no evidence that symptoms having to do with suicide. 

00:53:10
 Exactly. So that's the point in filling that checklist out that you do demonstrate where the follow up is to ensure that you're maintaining safety planning as possible. 

00:53:15
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN I don't know, are you criticizing it or making a comment? 

00:53:20
 No, I'm just, ah, continuing, it's not a criticism at all. 

00:53:20
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN All right. 

00:53:20
 It's just the question that's verifying your statement about that. 

00:53:25
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN I think that's what-- I'm not sure what's you're asking unfortunately. 

00:53:30
 Just that it demonstrates the follow up and that's the point that you're putting across. 

00:53:30
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN The fact, there is a follow up, yeah. 

00:53:35
 Exactly. Yeah. Okay. 

00:53:35
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN You just have to have a good reason for what you're doing. 

00:53:35
 Right. 

00:53:35
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN And fear, as I say to my clients, you know, you have to ask yourself, who you're treating here, the client or yourself. What you're gonna do is make decision without fear. You're in the wrong profession and you need to be somewhere else. 

00:53:50
 Thank you. 

00:53:50
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN And I just had this whole conversation with little bit of psychiatry resident who wouldn't let my patient out. Ah, because he said, "She dissolves it." But please which wasn't true, she would just kick some into that. And they laugh her out clearly, and said, "She's suicidal." And then they said, "We will not let you take her. I came-- went to get out-- to get out of there. We will know it." They, they say, "We will only let her out in your custody cuz they're afraid of being sued. I'm sure." And so I said-- she said, "Now, you have to agree, if she get suicide again, you'll bring her right back to the hospital." And I said, "You realize, there's no evidence for this." And she said, "I feel threatened." I said, "Look, you're making decision out of fear, a wrong reason for making decision." So, I think, you know, therapy takes courage. Let me take two more-- what is it? Two more questions, one more here and one more here. 

00:54:55
 Okay. Thank you for your presentation. Uhm, I'm wondering if you could address the, ah,-- first of all, the attitude of suicide in the United States compared to Europe. I mean, we're much more opposed to it and, ah, some states are having more and more the right for suicide. And don't you think that sometimes people deserve... 

00:55:15
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN I, I totally believe in the right of suicide. 

00:55:20
 Okay. 

00:55:20
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN I completely believe in it. However, if I-- I have to roll it, I believe that a therapist either has to be a therapist who consults with people, who want to kill themselves and how to make that decision, or they have to be a person who's helping people with severe mental disorder. Even though, I believe mentally disorder people have right to go-- I consider total pressure against mentally ill that they can kill themselves and which they can't, all these right things. So you know, if those people that ever been mentally ill, they wouldn't have those lots. But nonetheless, I believe that you can't do both. 

00:55:50
 Uhm-hmm. 

00:55:50
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN You can't be a person who's helping the person put their life together and be a person's helping ability to decide whether to kill themselves or not. Okay? So, I just had to roll it on, suicide is off the table into my mind. 

00:56:05
 Thank you very much. 

00:56:05
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN Because if I was on, on the table, I would agree with all my patients killing themselves is a good idea, frankly. 

00:56:10
 Okay. 

00:56:10
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN So, since we don't want me to do that, I doubt. Yes. Look, suffering, I mean, frankly, I mean, you all know, how many somebody is people suffer, I mean, it's invariable. Yes? 

00:56:25
 Do you know, uhm, if any crisis hotlines, utilize the caring letters, other than way to decreasing inpatient hospitalization or crisis exhibitions? 

00:56:30
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN No, but actually, to be perfectly honest with you, I never heard if anybody have that idea, that's one of the most fabulous ideas, I've heard. 

00:56:40
 Yeah. I'm thinking about taking, uhm, this idea-- cuz I work in a crisis hotline in Kern County, and I'm thinking about taking that idea to my bosses in which she says. 

00:56:50
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN I think it's too fabulous words, but if you do it, you gotta round my sympathy, (inaudible ) and check your data. I mean, do not do this without finding after work. 

00:56:56
 Oh, yeah, of course, got to research, research, research. 

00:57:00
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN If that will work. 

00:57:00
 Okay. Thank you., 

00:57:00
DR. MARSHA LINEHAN I think that's a fabulous idea, and you-- I, I never even you're my own mind. I want to get pediatric-- family doctors to do it. So, ah - 

00:57:10
