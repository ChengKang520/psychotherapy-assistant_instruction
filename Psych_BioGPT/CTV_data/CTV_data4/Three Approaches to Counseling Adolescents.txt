Navid Zamani, MFT 

00:00:25
NAVID ZAMANI My name is Navid Zamani and I'm a licensed marriage and family therapist in the State of California. I work with families of experiencing domestic violence through supervision of trainees, as well as in my private practice. I'm also a faculty member of the marriage and family therapy program at San Diego State University. I use narrative theory in my practice and in my conversation with clients. In this next session with Camille, I'm interested and curious to learn more about her and how she makes sense of the world around her. Thanks for meeting with me, Camille. 

00:00:55
CAMILLE Hi. 

00:00:55
NAVID ZAMANI Umm… Before you get started I just want to check with you, if it's okay that I take some notes? 

00:01:00
CAMILLE Yeah, of course. 

00:01:00
NAVID ZAMANI Umm… It's just for me to track kind of what you're saying and they're not my secret notes and I'm keeping over here. So if you want to see them, just let me know I can always share them with you. 

00:01:10
CAMILLE All right, perfect. 

00:01:10
NAVID ZAMANI Umm… So what kind… What has you coming into today? 

00:01:15
CAMILLE I just gonna to have a lot of stress with balancing school and friends and my family life. 

00:01:20
NAVID ZAMANI So it's stress with balancing school and friends and family life. Yeah. These are one of those items that kind of make sense to start off with and kind of hear a little bit more about? 

00:01:30
CAMILLE I mean my family's particularly just been stressful lately. So we can start off with that one. 

00:01:35
NAVID ZAMANI Okay. So when you talk about stressful, how are you gonna making sense of that? 

00:01:45
CAMILLE Umm… It's kind of just been like my siblings and my parents are fighting a lot. 

00:01:50
NAVID ZAMANI So stressful with the siblings and parents are fighting a lot. What do you… How do you experience stressfulness in those relationships? 

00:02:00
CAMILLE I mean it just kind of… When I go home it's supposed to be like… I'm supposed to go there and relax and be able to like do my schoolwork but it's just been hard with constantly fighting with my siblings and then hearing my parents fight, it's just, it's just not peaceful enough to do any of my schoolwork. 

00:02:20
NAVID ZAMANI Do you mind sharing a little bit about your parents and your siblings, like who are they? 

00:02:25
CAMILLE Yeah. So I have a brother and a sister. My brother's name is Sam and my sister's name is Mariah. 

00:02:35
NAVID ZAMANI How old are they? 

00:02:35
CAMILLE Umm… Mariah is 21 and my brother is 14. 

00:02:40
NAVID ZAMANI So you got Sam and Mariah and then your parents? 

00:02:45
CAMILLE Yeah. My dad and my mom… Well, my step mom. So… 

00:02:50
NAVID ZAMANI Cool. How would you kind of describe your relationships with, I guess maybe Sam and Mariah your siblings? 

00:03:00
CAMILLE So Sam's just kind of… He's kind of like that annoying little brother that always wants to like get in your space and I guess play, but I don't know he's getting older so I feel like he shouldn't not hang out with me more, but just kind of relax and find his own friends. 

00:03:20
NAVID ZAMANI Do you say he shouldn't hang out with me more? 

00:03:20
CAMILLE Not, not shouldn't, but he should find his own friends and have his own friends to spend time with and not just rely on me spending time with me. 

00:03:30
NAVID ZAMANI So you say he's annoying little brother and then you said I guess play? 

00:03:35
CAMILLE Yeah, he like always wants to hangout, like watch a movie, go to the park, go shoot, like hoops at the basketball court, and like that's fun when we have time to do it but I mean I've just been so busy trying to do all the stuff for school. So… 

00:03:50
NAVID ZAMANI So in some… And correct me if I'm wrong, and it is in some context you liking that and in other places it doesn't seem to work out so well? Is that sort of… 

00:04:00
CAMILLE Yeah, so it's… It's like, it's fun when I have time for it but it's just been, on like weekdays it's especially busy for me to balance that and spend time with him but then also be able to do my schoolwork. 

00:04:15
Externalizing Language used in Paraphrasing 

00:04:15
NAVID ZAMANI Umm… So… So there's something and correct me if I'm wrong and as I'm trying to make sense of what you're saying here that, there's something that you like about the playfulness like he kind of invites into your relationship with him, but also there's something to be said about how to balance that with schoolwork and the weekdays versus the weekends… 

00:04:35
CAMILLE Yeah definitely. 

00:04:35
NAVID ZAMANI How about Mariah? 

00:04:40
CAMILLE Mariah is almost never home. I mean she's 21, she has a full time job and she's going to school. So I rarely see her but I mean, we do that normal sister stuff where we steal each other's clothes and I mean, we fight a lot on the aspect. 

00:04:55
NAVID ZAMANI The normal sisters stuff? 

00:04:55
CAMILLE Yeah, I guess you can say that. 

00:05:00
Scaffolding Questions used in conjunction with externalizing language 

00:05:00
NAVID ZAMANI And I guess something about balance. How… What did… How would describe balances kind of role or presence in your relationship with Mariah? 

00:05:10
CAMILLE Umm… Well, we… When she's off of work we usually go and hang out umm… but I try to like make her priority one because she doesn't have a lot of time, rather than my brother, he's always home. So that's kind of make her priority one when she has the time and I'll kind of schedule around her because it's hard especially for her because she goes to school fulltime, plus works fulltime. 

00:05:40
Uncovering and Naming of Values 

00:05:40
NAVID ZAMANI What's important for you to make her priority one? 

00:05:40
CAMILLE I mean, she's like my sister. So I feel like I share with her more and she kind of is older and has the experience with, you know, the high school umm… aspect of what I'm kind of going through. So it's always nice to talk to her and kind of fill her know my week and also hear what she has to say about college because I mean, I'm gonna be there in a few years, so, yeah. 

00:06:05
NAVID ZAMANI So in some ways the time that you're spending with her umm… And correct me if I'm wrong because I'm making an assumption here about when you said that. Your conversation with her are feeding some hopes and preferences looking forward into your life as you're going into college and things like that? 

00:06:25
CAMILLE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:06:25
NAVID ZAMANI Does that make sense what I'm saying? 

00:06:30
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:06:30
NAVID ZAMANI So, I'd like to hear more about Sam, Mariah uh… Camille but I also want to check in on how you're making sense of your relationship with your dad and step mom, would you mind sharing a little bit about that? 

00:06:40
CAMILLE Yeah. So I actually just… Well, beginning of my freshman year, I actually moved to, moved in with my dad and my step mom. So it's kind of like a new relationship for me umm… but umm… With my step mom I'm more… I have a closer relationship because she's home more and I can ask like more questions about, you know, I don't know being a girl and stuff like that. 

00:07:10
NAVID ZAMANI So you've been able to connect with your step mom in some ways around, well, her presence being home which makes me think of also some of the ways that you're balancing your relations with Sam and Mariah. 

00:07:20
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:07:20
NAVID ZAMANI Umm… But also around uh… you said being a girl? 

00:07:25
CAMILLE Yeah, just like some from personal stuff like, like, I don't know, hair, make up and like boys and stuff. I mean, she's always kind of there like give me advice for school and stuff like that. 

00:07:40
Mapping the Effects 

00:07:40
NAVID ZAMANI Umm… What effects you noticed from having conversations like that with your step mom? 

00:07:40
CAMILLE Umm… It kind of helps. You know, when I come home she's there with like dinner and I can just distress by just talking with her and then kind of jump back into like stuff with school. 

00:07:50
NAVID ZAMANI You said you de-stress by talking to her? 

00:07:55
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:07:55
NAVID ZAMANI It kind of… 

00:07:55
CAMILLE Just kind of like organize my thoughts and everything, by like telling her about my day and telling her like what… 

00:08:05
NAVID ZAMANI Is that important to you to have time to organize your thoughts? 

00:08:05
CAMILLE Yeah. I feel like, at the end of the day if I can like talk to anybody about it or like, not, like write it down or something to like organize it, it just becomes so overwhelming. 

00:08:15
NAVID ZAMANI Umm… Are there other people in your life? Umm… I mean, I'm thinking about the four that we've been talking about but even beyond that they help you with this organizing thoughts thing that kind of that into your life? 

00:08:30
CAMILLE So I do have like other friends and stuff but mainly they're just like, on my sports teams or something and they don't… We don't really have time like sit and talk. Kind of like, like I would want to. 

00:08:40
NAVID ZAMANI So while there's… While you're noticing that organizing thoughts might be a helpful part in that relationship, it's kinda hard to find the time to manage that? 

00:08:50
CAMILLE Yeah. Because I mean in school and sports and everything. 

00:08:55
NAVID ZAMANI Does that… Is that kind of connected to what you said earlier about things being stressful with your parent's, siblings and friends? 

00:09:05
CAMILLE Yeah, because I mean, well, my friends and I have like a relationship like on the court, like while playing basketball. Umm… Like outside of it, it's just kind of, we don't really have time to kind of really go and hang out really. 

00:09:20
NAVID ZAMANI Is that okay for you? 

00:09:20
CAMILLE Umm… I mean, I would like too more. I just… I mean, my, sister is important to me and like, we do have to… I mean, I have time with them, it's just not like on a real personal level I guess. 

00:09:30
NAVID ZAMANI On a real personal level? What does that mean, a real personal level? Like, what does that look like in your life? 

00:09:35
CAMILLE I mean, like, we talk about… My friends and I, we talk about like school and like tests that are coming up but we don't sit and talk about like our personal problems or like, what we go through or what we feel and stuff like that, like our emotions. 

00:09:50
NAVID ZAMANI Is it okay that I'm kind of gonna hopping around with people in your life? Umm… So you mentioned this real personal level and how, with friends it's difficult to find the time and I get something of the word balance, I don't know if this fits in here. Umm... Would you… Would it be safe to say that real personal level uh... is present in your relationship with your step mom? 

00:10:15
CAMILLE Yeah. I felt like she's the number one person I would go to like, kind of tell everything to. So she's in, in an essence like my best friend. 

00:10:25
NAVID ZAMANI Umm... umm... It's your personal level and organizing thoughts might have some sort of relationship? 

00:10:35
CAMILLE Uh-mmm… 

00:10:40
NAVID ZAMANI So if it's okay for me to circle back to your sibling, Sam and Mariah. I was really caught by what you're saying about balance, because that word is kind of cropped up a couple times in our conversation. 

00:10:50
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:10:50
NAVID ZAMANI What is… What is balance mean to you? Like, how does that…? 

00:10:55
CAMILLE I feel like, it's kind of just finding the time to do my schoolwork, have those relationships and still like, I guess be like healthy or like, still find time to like sleep, you know, like, have the time to do my school work and sports and have those relationships and be able to still have like healthy lifestyle I have. 

00:11:20
NAVID ZAMANI Umm... So balance being present in your life allows you to do your work, attend to relationships, go to school and be, and kind of live a healthy lifestyle. Is that a fair capture of what you're saying? 

00:11:35
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:11:40
NAVID ZAMANI How have you come to recognize balance as something important in your life that you even want around? 

00:11:45
CAMILLE Yeah, I mean, I know I've like skip school a couple times because I'll just become so overwhelmed that I can't handle it all. So I've kind of just like not go to school to get on my schoolwork done if that makes sense. Like I know that it's a weird concept but huh… just finding the time to get everything done and still have those relationships is kind of, what I've kind of resorted to. 

00:12:05
NAVID ZAMANI He said it's a weird concepts? 

00:12:05
CAMILLE Like to skip school but still get on my, like school work done. So, I mean, I'm missing school but then I'm like trying to make up work. 

00:12:15
NAVID ZAMANI What has you thinking that, that might be weird versus because I'm hearing it kind of, it kind of make sense to me as I'm… 

00:12:25
CAMILLE Yeah, because I mean like I'm making up schoolwork but then again I'm missing that day. So I mean I'm still gonna be behind no matter what. So… 

00:12:35
NAVID ZAMANI So it's going to perpetual making up and then falling behind and making it up. Yeah. 

00:12:35
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:12:40
Statement of Position Map: 

00:12:40
Mapping the Effects of "Balance" 

00:12:40
NAVID ZAMANI So in some ways… Well, let me ask this, like, how are you… How would you describe the presence of balance if at all in school? Is balance there right now? 

00:12:55
CAMILLE No. So I've been trying to like do my schoolwork and, but it's just, with those problems outside like fighting all the time with my siblings, it's just kind of like gotten me behind. So… 

00:13:05
NAVID ZAMANI So in some ways balance gets energy from a couple domains in your life? 

00:13:10
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:13:10
NAVID ZAMANI Like if the balance… If balance is struggling to get some energy from the siblings area, it has effects on the school stuff? How do you make sense of that relationship? 

00:13:25
CAMILLE I mean, it's definitely hard. I mean, I've tried to umm… Like, I said balancing but it's hard. Umm... Can you say that again? 

00:13:35
NAVID ZAMANI Uh… No. I mean, it's, it's… I'm asking kind of a… I guess a complicated and convoluted in some ways question. And I guess just explaining like how I'm thinking about it is umm... you're… you're mentioning some of the… But at least from what I heard you mention some of the ways a balance shows up and how you do attend to things in your life that you think are or you find important, is that fair, what things said? And then in some ways that balance, it's got its kind of tentacles in a couple of places in your life. And in some places in your life, you're noticing that one of the tentacles might be, I don't know how you describe this and I kind of looking to you to support me and talking about this, like… 

00:14:15
CAMILLE Like, my priorities I guess, is that what you… 

00:14:20
NAVID ZAMANI Well, let me back up, so perhaps, would it make sense to maybe talk about balance for a minute? 

00:14:25
CAMILLE Sure. 

00:14:25
NAVID ZAMANI So I ask this question when has balance or when did you identify balance as something important in your life? 

00:14:35
CAMILLE I mean, like, like when I don't have time to you know, hang out with my sister or when I don't have time to do my school work. Like, that's where it becomes imbalance and I can't like… They're all important to do. I just feel like it's, if I don't have time to do either one of them or any of them umm... it becomes imbalance and then it doesn't, it doesn't work. 

00:15:00
NAVID ZAMANI So when, when balance is around, how would you describe your relationships with all these people like with… with school, for, for instance? 

00:15:05
CAMILLE I mean, I feel like it all runs kind of smoothly when I do have that balance. It's like get a chunk of time with my sister or a chunk of time with, you know, friends at school, I still have time to do my schoolwork. So everything kind of runs smoothly and it's going good. 

00:15:25
NAVID ZAMANI Can you think about time where balance was present with you at school? 

00:15:30
CAMILLE Umm... Kind of like in the beginning of the year when I didn't have so much schoolwork to do and I was, had that time to balance and do everything I wanted to do. 

00:15:40
NAVID ZAMANI So you said when, in the beginning of the school year when there was less work? What do you think was umm… What do you think, it was about less work that was supporting balance? 

00:15:55
CAMILLE Umm... I mean, it was kind of easier to get all my work done at school. So I didn't have that carry into my home life. I guess it was easier. 

00:16:05
NAVID ZAMANI When did you noticed balance, balances influence at school starting to kind of move away or not… 

00:16:10
CAMILLE I started trying to like spend more time with my brother and my sister and everything like that. So then I, and I got but I still have the work to do, so it's still kind of piling up while I was allocating other time for like my brother and my sister. 

00:16:30
Naming and Co- Authoring "Importance" 

00:16:30
NAVID ZAMANI Umm… So you're, you're kind of attending to your family and spend some time with them. What would you call that thing that you're, that you're doing in terms of prioritizing your relationship with your families? 

00:16:40
CAMILLE Well, what I call that? 

00:16:40
NAVID ZAMANI Yeah. 

00:16:45
CAMILLE Umm... I'd call that like, I don't know like they are important to me and I just wanted to be able to spend time with them because I don't always have the time to spend time with them. 

00:16:55
NAVID ZAMANI So importance in some way that… And I… And I remember you mentioned with Mariah that she's priority one? 

00:17:05
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:17:05
NAVID ZAMANI And so that word prioritized has been kind of stuck with me. What is it about prioritizing your family that's important? 

00:17:15
CAMILLE Umm… Well, I know like, I have a personal relationship with my step mom as well as my sister Mariah. So I just have that umm… kind of deeper relationship to be able to talk to them, rather than like a friend outside of school. Like, if I had a friend outside of school or a friend outside of my family to kind of have that personal relationship, I probably prioritize them. So I'd be able to talk to them about, kind of like personal issues that I go through, like in school, and in, at my home, but it's, it's more and my family that I'm closer with. 

00:17:50
[sil.] 

00:17:55
NAVID ZAMANI Umm… Would you mind if I ask a question about something you brought up earlier? 

00:18:00
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:18:00
NAVID ZAMANI Uh… You said that you moved in with your dad and step mom, freshman of your high school? Uh… Where were you before that? 

00:18:05
CAMILLE Umm... I lived in Utah. 

00:18:05
NAVID ZAMANI Utah. So when you moved in with your dad and step mom, umm... and then, were Sam and Mariah there as well? 

00:18:15
CAMILLE Yes. 

00:18:15
NAVID ZAMANI So you had to live with Sam and Mariah prior to that? 

00:18:20
CAMILLE No. 

00:18:20
NAVID ZAMANI How would you describe balance at that time in your life? And I making an assumption that about any move like moves in my life have been really challenging. 

00:18:30
CAMILLE Yeah. Like, I mean, it's totally different in Utah. I mean, there's not as much people. I like cultural differences, you know, moving here to California. It was definitely harder umm… to see all the differences and be like, just, it's just different culture. So it's hard. It's kind of… The transition was different and hard but… 

00:18:50
NAVID ZAMANI How did you manage all that? 

00:18:55
CAMILLE Umm... It was hard. But, I mean, I kept going and I kept like trying to find people to kind of help me. Like, my sister helped me a lot because she was still in school at that time. 

00:19:05
NAVID ZAMANI Mariah? 

00:19:05
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:19:10
NAVID ZAMANI So Mariah was really kind of critical in… 

00:19:10
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:19:10
NAVID ZAMANI This transition thing? 

00:19:15
CAMILLE Yeah. So she was like number one to help me move to that school and find kind of like, not who I am, but like play things that I liked in that school, because I didn't… When I first moved I did not like it, I wanted to move back. 

00:19:30
NAVID ZAMANI In the context of our time like balance at school, like words, how did you kind of sometimes prioritizing family and then trying to play catch up and all the stuff. How are you making sense of balance at that time, was it, was it around? 

00:19:45
CAMILLE Like back when I lived? 

00:19:45
NAVID ZAMANI When you first moved? 

00:19:45
CAMILLE When I first moved? Umm... There was a lot of imbalances I feel like because everything was new to me. So I didn't know how to balance kind of any of it. The school is different, people were different, like the sports teams were different. So it was just learning a new culture and the kind of place to be. 

00:20:10
NAVID ZAMANI This might be kind of a bizarre question. But we're gonna try out if that's the okay? 

00:20:10
CAMILLE Okay. 

00:20:15
NAVID ZAMANI What did you kind of… What did you come to know about yourself during that time? 

00:20:15
CAMILLE Umm... I kind of learned that I really like sports, I really like to be athletic and out there. Umm... I also like to be in the community helping, so I also joined like clubs and stuff like that. Umm... And that's kind of where I found kind of myself and I liked. I was like a student athlete and that's kind of like who I was. So I really like that aspect of myself rather than like my sister who is kind of more like… She had a job and she did school but she kind of prioritized her job more than anything. 

00:20:50
NAVID ZAMANI Why you like being seen as athlete? 

00:20:55
CAMILLE I mean, like I said it it's like a balance. I mean, you get like… I feel like sports and clubs and stuff, they draw you more to school. So you get to like, you're more, you want to go to school. So it's not as overwhelming and you want to like be a part of the community that I just moved to, so that's what really helped me make the transition. 

00:21:20
NAVID ZAMANI So student athlete supports being connected to communities? 

00:21:25
CAMILLE Like, yeah, within my own school. 

00:21:25
NAVID ZAMANI Yeah. 

00:21:25
CAMILLE (inaudible(00:21:27]). 

00:21:25
NAVID ZAMANI Sorry… 

00:21:25
CAMILLE No, go ahead. I'm sorry. 

00:21:30
NAVID ZAMANI No, 'm sorry I interrupt you. So it invites communities like you said at school and it also supported balance being in your life. So is that correct? 

00:21:40
CAMILLE Yes. 

00:21:45
Continuing to Map the Effects of "Balance" with breadth, depth and length 

00:21:45
NAVID ZAMANI So, Camille, if I may ask umm… I'm gonna try out this question. So if it doesn't make sense please let me know and I'm happy to reword it and restructure. When balances in your life and I know you've mentioned kind of the flipside of balance, imbalance. So I'm interested and perhaps looking at that as well if that makes the question more clear. When balances in your life, how would you describe "What it feels like to be in your body?" 

00:22:20
CAMILLE When balance is present? 

00:22:20
NAVID ZAMANI Yeah, like what's present in your body like what's different about how you navigate the world? 

00:22:25
CAMILLE I kind of feel more like happy, not happy but like excited to continue and because everything's working smoothly so everything is like good to go. So, like, I'd just, it's happy and more like encouraged to go to school, I want to go to school and you know, keep that balance in my life. 

00:22:45
NAVID ZAMANI And happy and excited you mentioned, right? How would you… How would you describe that sensation in your body? 

00:22:55
CAMILLE It's good. 

00:22:55
NAVID ZAMANI Does there certain places that you feel, feel happiness or exicited? Does it, a fullness in your heart or uh… 

00:23:00
CAMILLE Yeah, I mean it's really good to be a part of a community, so that, like, feeling of I fit in, in a place and I have, I belong somewhere, that's such a good feeling in my heart and in my head to know that I can go to them. And even though in my family it's good to know that I can go to my mom if anything would happen, you know, like, actually talk about it. 

00:23:25
NAVID ZAMANI Yeah. And, and, and there's the, the energy and the connectedness the community and the fullness of the heart umm... are those things that or I guess, let me ask like what is the relationship with stressful or the experience of stressful in your life? 

00:23:45
CAMILLE When things like start colliding I guess, when things start… When I start like messing up in school or like not having time for Sam or not having time Mariah, it's hard to like… That’s what stresses me out, is not having that priority and like letting someone down, because I mean in essence that's what I do and Sam wants to go play and I can't go with him because I have to finish school work. I mean, letting him down stresses me out because I know I didn't have that time because of something I did. So it was just kind of that, like, uh… you didn't get it done and still have priority for other people. 

00:24:25
NAVID ZAMANI So, Camille, I want to just thank you for, you know, letting me into a little sliver and window of your life and sharing about Sam and Mariah, your dad, and your step mom, your move from Utah and some of the ways that you were managing umm... that situation. And it's interesting to me that Mariah was a pretty critical person in that transition and as you're going into another big transition, Mariah is priority one. 

00:24:50
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:24:50
NAVID ZAMANI Umm... That's kind of makes sense to me. 

00:24:55
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:24:55
NAVID ZAMANI Umm... And, you know, I'm really interested about how balance has its tentacles, to use that language, I was earlier and it, it kind of draws from a couple of different areas of your life and one area has kind of impacts on others. 

00:25:10
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:25:15
NAVID ZAMANI Is that a fair little capture of my own of your life? 

00:25:15
CAMILLE Yeah, yeah, it's crazy, I know. 

00:25:20
NAVID ZAMANI That I can relate in my own life with how much balance affects my own ability to move around and be okay. So thanks for... 

00:25:30
CAMILLE Yeah, of course, thank you. 

00:25:35
Session Two: 

00:25:35
Cognitive Behavioral Approach 

00:25:40
Sarah Archer, MFT 

00:25:40
SARAH ARCHER My name is Sarah Archer, I'm a licensed marriage and family therapist. I am program manager at UCSD Eating Disorder Treatment and Research Center and have a private practice. Next, I'll be meeting with Camille using a cognitive behavioral approach where we'll be examining how her thoughts and feelings impact her behavior. Hey, Camille, how are you? 

00:26:00
CAMILLE I'm good. How are you doing? 

00:26:05
SARAH ARCHER Good, good to see you this week. 

00:26:05
CAMILLE Thank you. 

00:26:10
SARAH ARCHER I recently spoke to your step mom and she's been letting me know that you're still struggling a bit with your grades and recently got caught cutting class. 

00:26:20
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:26:20
SARAH ARCHER Yeah. What's been going on? So is that… How often are you cutting class? 

00:26:25
CAMILLE I mean, not like that much. I mean, she's kind of being overdramatic. But I mean, I cut a class a few times with my friends just to like go and (inaudible(00:26:37]) some other stress and stuff. So… 

00:26:40
SARAH ARCHER What about… How are your grades? I know your grades historically have been really important to you, but I heard they were dropping a bit? 

00:26:45
CAMILLE I mean, yeah, just because I've, I feel like I've been missing some school obviously umm... but… I don't know I just, not my priority one right now and I don't really know why but it's just kind of become on the side. 

00:27:00
SARAH ARCHER So school has been kind of pushed to the side and it sounds like blowing off steam has been more of the priority? 

00:27:05
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:27:10
SARAH ARCHER And that's a bit… I know you're friends have always been super important to you but I know school has been in the past. Is it you trying to figure out like what's going on or what, what do you think the shift has been? 

00:27:20
CAMILLE Honestly, I don't know. I mean, I've been playing sports with them for a long time and we just been, you know, hanging out more and more. So it's just us, you know, doing our own thing. 

00:27:35
SARAH ARCHER Being teenagers. 

00:27:35
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:27:35
SARAH ARCHER I know that's normal. 

00:27:35
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:27:35
SARAH ARCHER Have you been getting them into trouble because of the cutting class and the grades, like, I know your step mom super into your academic… 

00:27:45
CAMILLE Yeah, I mean, I know like we used to talk a lot, but now, we just, she's been fighting a lot with my dad. So I mean we don't get to talk as much. 

00:27:50
SARAH ARCHER Umm… So there's a lot of conflict and… Okay. Has your dad or your mom, they given you any like, you're not able to go out or you're not… 

00:28:00
CAMILLE I mean, it's just school and sports right now. I mean, they basically, I don't have time to do anything else but it's just school and sports. So I got into a little trouble. 

00:28:15
SARAH ARCHER Yeah, I heard you said that you kind of don't understand maybe why you're doing what you're doing thing when you're more stressed. Do you think it would be helpful for you to see potentially what's influencing your behaviors? 

00:28:30
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:28:30
SARAH ARCHER Yeah? 

00:28:30
CAMILLE Yeah, that would be a good idea. 

00:28:30
Core Beliefs or Feelings Tree 

00:28:30
SARAH ARCHER Yeah, sometimes it can be helpful to look at like what influences our actions and maybe you and I could focus on examining that and then maybe taking some steps to change that. Cool. All right. What I like to do with a lot of my clients is make what I call a core belief or a feelings tree and I list, so I want to draw tree and bear with me because I'm a poor artist. So, I'll make a tree umm... and eventually we're gonna get to look at the branches which I call like behavioral branches, but we'll start out at the bottom of the tree. What's underneath the tree? 

00:29:05
CAMILLE The… What do they call them? The trunk of the tree… 

00:29:10
SARAH ARCHER The trunk and then what's under the trunk in there? 

00:29:10
CAMILLE Okay, like the roots. 

00:29:10
SARAH ARCHER The roots, perfect, exactly. So roots, when I think of roots, I think of umm... First I like to talk about, maybe for roots like what are some, maybe like unpleasant things or challenging things that maybe you've had to deal with throughout your life. Child now, any time of your life that have been maybe difficult. 

00:29:35
CAMILLE I mean, one thing that I think is really difficult was moving from Utah to California. 

00:29:40
SARAH ARCHER Oh, wow, that must have been really hard. Okay, and we're gonna get into what feelings that brought up into a sec, but first I wanna just list out as many routes as possible. So you move from Utah to California. Okay, what else? 

00:29:50
CAMILLE Umm… 

00:29:55
SARAH ARCHER What about like your parents divorcing? 

00:29:55
CAMILLE Oh, yeah. 

00:29:55
SARAH ARCHER Yeah? 

00:30:00
CAMILLE Oh, yeah. 

00:30:00
SARAH ARCHER Yeah, parents divorcing. Those could be challenging. What else? 

00:30:05
CAMILLE Umm... When my dad decided to move to California and he took like my siblings and like not me. 

00:30:10
SARAH ARCHER Oh, okay. So dad taking your brother and sister and not you that must've been a pretty significant event. Any other routes you can think of that have been challenging for you throughout your life? 

00:30:35
CAMILLE I can't think of any. 

00:30:35
SARAH ARCHER Those are pretty significant. Well, why do we start there and if any other ones pop up you can tell me. 

00:30:40
CAMILLE Okay. 

00:30:40
SARAH ARCHER So let's start to like… So what I like to do with this tree is, first we have the roots and then exactly what you said prior we're gonna look at the trunk and really look at umm... How… Let's start with Utah. So moving from Utah to California. What… How do you think that impacted the way you see Things? And the way I like to do it is kind of like the world is. I am others kind of fill in the blank. So what about that trip, that move, like what was hard about it? 

00:31:20
CAMILLE I mean, like it, there were two totally different like cultures. Like, I… When I went to school in Utah it was like mainly like one race or like, we were all like the same. 

00:31:30
SARAH ARCHER Not very diverse. 

00:31:35
CAMILLE Yeah, and then when I went to California, it was like such a diverse school and like there was all these different clubs and it was a lot going on, I guess you can say. 

00:31:40
SARAH ARCHER So it was more… So they moved from Utah to California, it was a big change for you. Was it sudden or like what was hard about for you the most? 

00:31:45
CAMILLE I mean, for me like I felt like I didn't fit in like, there is no other place for me to go. 

00:31:50
SARAH ARCHER Got it, so take that with. So you didn't fit in with the change. So what does that say about you? 

00:32:00
CAMILLE I felt like I didn’t belong. 

00:32:00
SARAH ARCHER Okay so, I… Yeah, I don’t belong, awesome. So I don't belong. Okay, so that's a belief that you have coming from that experience. Okay, and then your parents divorcing. Divorce can be really difficult. 

00:32:15
CAMILLE Yeah. And I mean they divorced kind of when I was young. It was just like… like… what, like brought them to the decision where like my siblings would go with my dad and I would stay, you know, with my biological mom until I moved. So it's kind of like… I don't know I just felt like I never really had a relationship with my siblings or my dad. So… 

00:32:35
SARAH ARCHER That must been a really devastating? 

00:32:40
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:32:40
SARAH ARCHER Yeah, what did… Especially, like think about your relationship with your dad. Like, I can imagine feeling as a child especially like, you used the word 'he chose.' So if he chose your siblings over you, if that's the way you think about this, what does that say about yourself, like, how must he then view you? 

00:32:55
CAMILLE I feel like I didn't… Like, he didn't think of me as his daughter. Like I wasn't part of his family I guess kind of. Like I was an outsider. 

00:33:05
SARAH ARCHER I'm an outsider? Did you feel loved? 

00:33:10
CAMILLE Umm... I felt by my mom, but I felt like he didn't care really about me or like what would happen to me when I, while I stayed in Utah. 

00:33:20
SARAH ARCHER So if he didn't care enough about you to stay in Utah, kind of pull from that too, like what does that say about how he, how you were, like you're what? 

00:33:30
CAMILLE Yeah, like I felt like… Like my mom was the only one that really cared and then…. I mean she was working all the time, so she didn't have a lot of time to spend with me, so I was kind of by myself a lot. 

00:33:40
SARAH ARCHER Like you aren't like a priority? 

00:33:45
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:33:45
SARAH ARCHER Okay. So based on, I just wanna make sure, I'm not putting any words in your mouth. Based on what some of the roots were that occurred, it sounds like the move, the parents divorcing your dad, umm... being with your brother and sister, that led you to some of the beliefs that I don't belong, I'm not a priority, I'm an outsider. Do you think any, other thoughts pop up when you, when you focus on those events like how you view other people as the way they look at you or the way the world is. Like I have a lot of patients that say, you know, bad things happen or the world is unpredictable or you know, other people don't like me, like, do any other things pop up for you? 

00:34:30
CAMILLE I mean, I feel like, my… Like I feel like my dad and like that part of my family like me, Sbut I feel like also they moved may realize that, you know, we all… I felt like we all feel like we're outsider sometimes and we just have to find our way, but I mean for me I am away for a while and I mean it was really hard to find like someone that I liked. I like, would accept me for like who I was because I felt like I always had to like change who I was to fit in. 

00:35:05
SARAH ARCHER Wow. So it's like I'm not accepted or I'm not good enough. 

00:35:05
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:35:10
SARAH ARCHER Yeah. Okay, so if we take a minute to really think about these significant core beliefs like I'm not good enough, I'm an outsider, I don't belong. When you focus on that for a second what, what feelings pop up for you? 

00:35:25
CAMILLE I feel angry. I think a lot at my, at my dad. 

00:35:30
SARAH ARCHER So anger? 

00:35:30
CAMILLE Umm... I kind of feel sad being left out as well. 

00:35:35
SARAH ARCHER Yeah. 

00:35:35
CAMILLE I like the family and at school. Umm... Kind of like disappointed to like because I feel like a lot of things that happened in school too, like, I could have done something, like I could have just stuck to who I was and not change myself. 

00:36:00
[sil.] 

00:36:05
SARAH ARCHER How intense are these feelings of anger, sadness, and disappointment? 

00:36:10
CAMILLE Uh... It kind of depends on the day I guess. 

00:36:10
SARAH ARCHER Uh-mmm... 

00:36:15
CAMILLE Umm... Some days is like I really think about it and like it gets me down, especially when my mom's at work and I don't really have someone I do feel like alone. But, I mean, the change also kind of helped with the feelings I guess umm... 

00:36:30
SARAH ARCHER Were they pretty significant? 

00:36:30
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:36:35
SARAH ARCHER Okay, it's kind of again if you focus on the tree, we have our roots and we can't change the roots, right? Like, I can't change the fact that you moved from Utah, I can't change the fact that, you know, your dad for whatever reason, umm... your siblings were with him or that your parents divorced and we've now examined your thoughts sassociated with those events and those thoughts elicit a lot of anger, sadness and disappointment. And then I sometimes think like thoughts and feelings are like a drug and make us act in a certain way uh… because based on meeting you I can tell that you're really caring, like a really nice fun girl. And I think a lot of the behaviors that you're showing recently, they are kind of, not, they go against your value system in a way. 

00:37:20
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:37:20
SARAH ARCHER Right? So I think that when you're under the influence of anger and sadness, next usually what happens is our behaviors, right? So I thought events impact our thoughts, our thoughts impact our feelings and then feelings of anger, sadness, and disappointment impact our actions. So if you look at the tree, next I'm looking at like the behavioral branches because I felt that. So we know that you're cutting class, so that's a behavior. So when you're under the influence of anger and sadness, you cut class, you don't make school a priority and I know in the last session we talked about getting in like arguments and conflict with your dad, brother, and sister. 

00:38:05
CAMILLE Uh-mmm... 

00:38:05
SARAH ARCHER Are there any other behaviors that have popped up in the last couple months that you've noticed that are problematic for you or they go against your value system or who you are? 

00:38:15
CAMILLE Umm... I feel like the kids that I hang out with like, I kind of allow them to like bully other people too and like I don't stick up for them. 

00:38:25
SARAH ARCHER Uh-mmm... So maybe don't stick up for others. 

00:38:30
CAMILLE Uh-mmm.. 

00:38:35
SARAH ARCHER Any others? 

00:38:35
CAMILLE Umm... Not that I can think of. 

00:38:40
SARAH ARCHER And how problematic do you think these behaviors are like? We know the consequences like, I know a couple weeks ago you weren't able to go to that big party you wanted to go to, that was the consequence from your step mom, but like… So you know some consequences are you don't get to do what you want to do but what are the other consequences for you like, do you think you struggle with guilt or…? 

00:39:00
CAMILLE I mean, I feel like, a lot of times I feel like spiteful, like to my parents. I feel like maybe that would be why I cut class, or like why I choose to hang out my friends instead of going home. 

00:39:15
SARAH ARCHER Well, that anger you talked about? 

00:39:15
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:39:15
SARAH ARCHER Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Do you think after the behavior though, there's any guilt? 

00:39:20
CAMILLE Yeah, I feel like when I don't stick up for other people too, when my friends like make fun of them, I feel like I feel guilty. And I feel guilty when my grades go down because I know I can do something about it. 

00:39:35
SARAH ARCHER Yeah. Okay. So the consequences are like actual punishments and then feelings of maybe guilt are continued anger. 

00:39:40
CAMILLE Uh-mmm... 

00:39:40
SARAH ARCHER Okay. So, ooking at this and kind of recognizing more… Sorry for my not using artistic creativity, but does that make more sense because I think you came in today wanting to understand a little bit more of why you do what you do, it's not that you're a bad kid or that something's really wrong with you, it's that some of the events that you've experienced in your life have kind of trickled to thoughts and feelings and behaviors, does that make more sense? 

00:40:10
CAMILLE Yeah, definitely. 

00:40:10
SARAH ARCHER Great. 

00:40:10
CAMILLE So like my thoughts leads like my actions, so I can change kind of a... 

00:40:15
SARAH ARCHER Yeah, like what? Is that the reality is, "can I change, can I take away your roots?" 

00:40:20
CAMILLE No. 

00:40:20
SARAH ARCHER No. What I would like to do is add roots because a lot of the times we tend to focus only on what's gone wrong in our life, but the idea is that if we spend some time you and I may be in the next session, we could spend a lot of time looking at what are some other routes in your life that may be either work difficult but umm... more balanced or that were great, you know, like, I know the time that you made the, the soccer team. So wow, that's a really good event we can have that or the time that you and your dad went on that trip just the two of you. 

00:41:00
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:41:00
SARAH ARCHER And then what we wanna do is revise our thoughts and look at creating more balance thoughts so that like instead of I'm not good enough, saying something like well, maybe umm... I wasn't as effective in this area of my life but I really succeeded in this or that maybe my dad umm... was focused more on my brother and sister and he also was there for me during this period of time. And the goal is that, if we can revise your thoughts, maybe your feelings uh... won't be as intense, umm... and that, then your behavior would change. 

00:41:40
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:41:40
SARAH ARCHER Does that make sense? 

00:41:40
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:41:40
SARAH ARCHER Okay. Good. Well, thank you so much for spending the time doing this. Did it… Did it seem helpful? 

00:41:50
CAMILLE Yeah, a lot. 

00:41:50
SARAH ARCHER Good. Well, let's set up an appointment. We'll go to the front desk set up the appointment for next week. Can I look forward to see you? 

00:41:55
CAMILLE All right. Thank you so much. 

00:41:55
SARAH ARCHER Thanks. 

00:42:00
Session Three: 

00:42:00
Solution-focused Approach 

00:42:05
Mayumi Yamanaka Douglass, MFT 

00:42:05
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Hello, my name is Mayumi Yamanaka Douglass. I'm originally from Mexico. Uh... and then my license marriage and family therapy, graduated from San Diego State University and then AMFD approved supervisor. And my professional role includes to be a consultant, a clinical supervisor, and then I joined faculty member for San Diego State University. Next you're gonna see me talking to Camille. She's a teenager and all I knew was that she was experiencing some stress. So using the solution focused approach, what I'm doing is trying to clearly identify the problem, use compliments, scale in questions, and to be able to identify your motivational so for making changes to this problem. I'm trying to find a specific changes that she can start making within the same week to help her to move towards her goal. My language is umm... mostly present and future oriented when we're thinking about finding solutions to her problem. And again you're gonna see me using compliments and really identifying the things that she's doing right. Uh... its an opportunity to identify these exceptions to the problem and continue building in what's working. Hi. 

00:43:35
CAMILLE Hi. 

00:43:40
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So I know that your name is Camille. 

00:43:40
CAMILLE Uh-mmm. 

00:43:40
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay, nice meeting you. 

00:43:45
CAMILLE It's nice to meet you too. 

00:43:45
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS My name is Mayumi. 

00:43:45
CAMILLE Mayumi? 

00:43:45
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yes. 

00:43:45
CAMILLE Okay. 

00:43:50
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS I know it’s a little strange, actually Japanese, but I'm from Mexico so it's a combination. 

00:43:55
CAMILLE Okay. 

00:43:55
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yeah. 

00:43:55
CAMILLE It's cool. 

00:44:00
Identify specific problem 

00:44:00
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So umm... we've some time to talk about anything that you like to discuss. 

00:44:00
CAMILLE Okay. 

00:44:00
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Is there something that you would like to focus on today? 

00:44:05
CAMILLE I mean, I'm just kind of been stressed out from school and my home life and just trying to find the balance to kind of work with them. 

00:44:15
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay. So there's stress happening at school and in your home life. Would you like to focus on one of them in particular or both? 

00:44:25
CAMILLE I mean, mainly school because I mean, my grades have been kind of been dropping a little bit umm... and like my friends and stuff have become a really big influence. 

00:44:35
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay. So there's two things that are stressing you at school, one is your grades and the other one is about your friends. Would you like to focus on one of those for our time? 

00:44:45
CAMILLE Umm... No, not particularly. 

00:44:50
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay, so both of them. Okay, so tell me more about uh... your friends, what's happening? 

00:44:55
CAMILLE So, I mean, I'm in basketball. So umm... it's kind of basketball season. So I've been kind of been going to practice and getting closer with my friends in school and then on the court. 

00:45:05
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay. 

00:45:05
CAMILLE It's just, but they're kind of umm... When we're around other people at school they're kind of mean to them and they bully them. And I feel like I don't really do anything about it, I just kind of sit back and watch. And I feel like that's what makes me feel bad too because I mean I like hang out with my friends, but they also like make some bad decisions and I don't agree with them. So… 

00:45:30
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So what makes you feel bad is that you're not agreeing with the way that they are acting with other people and not saying anything in the moment gives you like this feeling that… 

00:45:40
CAMILLE Uh-mmm... 

00:45:45
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay. And then umm... what about your grades, what's happening there? 

00:45:55
CAMILLE Umm... Well, I've missed school a few times umm... It's kind of put me back umm... with like turning an assignments and stuff like that. So missing school and like, just haven't been there, so I don't really know what's going on and then. 

00:46:05
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Of course. 

00:46:05
CAMILLE So like my grades been dropping. 

00:46:10
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So it's not that your grades are dropping because you don't know this object in terms of like umm... it's really difficult for you is just that you haven't been there. So because you have been missing that umm... the class then you don't know how to go about that? 

00:46:20
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:46:25
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS And how come you are missing out on school? What's holding you back from attending school? 

00:46:30
CAMILLE So, I mean, I've just kind of made… I mean, I keep going and leaving with my friends, so like I'll… I'll go but then like me and my friends will leave and then… 

00:46:40
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS The same friends from basketball practice? 

00:46:40
CAMILLE Yeah, so we'll just leave school and disco and hang out or like go get food. It's just a kind of like destress from like home and anything that were like, you know, thinking about or whatever. 

00:46:55
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So let's go back to that moment in which you are at school and you're planning to go to the class umm... and you know that you need to be at the class to know what's gonna be on the test and quizzes and all of that, but then you see your friends and I'm guessing that they are inviting you to come over with them, right? I'm guessing that it's not your idea. You're not like, okay. So what do they say? What type of… 

00:47:20
CAMILLE Just kind of like, oh, like come on, come on with us, Camille, like, you know, just urging me to go and then if I'd say, no, I mean, we should have school, they, they call me like a nerd or whatever. 

00:47:30
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay. 

00:47:30
CAMILLE So it's just kind of like, if I don't go with them, I feel like I'll miss out on something that they do and then I won't know what they're talking about later or like… So I just feel like that pressure to be with them and be like who I guess. So… 

00:47:45
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So the pressure should be with them and should be cool? 

00:47:50
CAMILLE So that kind of… And then like I know, like I'm gonna miss school and I know I'm gonna miss like stuff in the text and I know it's gonna lower my grade. I just feel like… Lately I just haven't cared and I just wanna to go and like relax to. Like, part of me wants to go and then part of me wants a stay in school. So it's just kind of like pulling me both ways. 

00:48:10
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yeah, but that part of you that wants to stay at school, when your friends are saying come over let's keep it, something is happening that you are not giving voice to that part. 

00:48:20
CAMILLE Uh-umm... 

00:48:25
Summarize client's description of the problem 

00:48:25
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS And you are going along with what your friends are inviting you to do. So what I'm hearing is that actually there should be from problems are not so different or not so separate, but actually kind of the same problem if I may say. And you tell me this sounds like a problem umm... that you are experiencing. It sounds to me that the problem has to do with, being in this situation in which something doesn't feel right and not giving voice to this part and then umm... going along and then having the consequences for that causing the stress. So when you are in the lunch tables and your friends are calling somebody names and you are not saying something, you are again not giving voice to this part of you that wants to advocate for those that are being, you know, bullied in a way. And then because you don’t do that, then the stress comes and just feeling overwhelmed about that. 

00:49:25
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:49:25
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS And then when you're at school and then your friends are telling you, common, let's skip class and there's a part of you that wants to go to class, you know that you want to be able to graduate and to move on with your, you know, education plans. But then they again there is something that is happening that is not allowing you to voice that and to say out loud, hey, I'm sorry but I actually don't want to miss school, I'll see you later. 

00:49:50
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:49:55
Asking client to define the problem(s) 

00:49:55
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So there's, there's this problem of not… How will you define this problem if we can name it? 

00:49:55
CAMILLE Like, I don’t know. I feel like I'm too scared to say anything because like, I'm going to get like the backlash of that or like they won't want to be my friend anymore or like, stuff like that. 

00:50:05
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay. So it's some type of a problem of umm... related to fear for umm... not, not want, for them not wanting to be your friend? So it's fear of… Is it just them or like a fear of being alone, fear of disagreeing with people, fear of people not liking you? 

00:50:30
CAMILLE Yeah, I feel like they won't like me if I stand up for myself and for them. 

00:50:35
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yes. 

00:50:40
Validate client's experience 

00:50:40
CAMILLE And then, like after I do that I feel like I'm gonna be alone and like they're not gonna want me in the team anymore and like… I don’t know, I just feel there's a big thing of being alone and not having any friends. 

00:50:45
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yes. 

00:50:50
CAMILLE So… 

00:50:50
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS No, that's big. 

00:50:50
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:50:50
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS That's big. And at your age, you know, there's so much pressure about who are your friends with and what part of group you are with and all of that and then suddenly feeling like, this group that is a cool group, in the basketball practice they are not liking you anymore, that seems like… Yeah. 

00:51:10
CAMILLE This is all like pressure like, and like stress. So that's what really has been going on and I just feel like it's not. Like, either way that I do it, I'm gonna wind up like being left out or… 

00:51:20
Identify client's motivation to make changes 

00:51:20
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS And that's what we're thinking right now because right now umm... you have choices, right? And you are choosing to silence this voice and go along with them because you don't want to risk for them not to like you and "to be alone" right? But then, is this way of going, is that working for you? 

00:51:45
CAMILLE No. 

00:51:45
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS No, right? Because it's making you feel overwhelmed and is giving you this… He's giving you, he's causing you trouble at school because you are skipping classes, your grades are going down, I'm sure that's causing some type of trouble at home, right? And your parents are not happy about that or whoever is living with you. And now so we're not voicing, when you are not liking what they're saying to other friends or, or the people at school, then he's giving us a sense of not feeling okay, with that and that's a heavy feeling, right? 

00:52:20
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:52:20
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So what you're doing right now is not working? 

00:52:20
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:52:25
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Would you agree with that? 

00:52:25
CAMILLE Yes. 

00:52:25
Identify exceptions to the problem 

00:52:25
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Has there been any times in which you have been able to speak up for yourself even having the pressure from other people? 

00:52:40
CAMILLE Umm... I feel like in my classes. 

00:52:40
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay. 

00:52:40
CAMILLE I'd be able to stand like… Because I know for sure what's gonna happen if I stand up and say like the right… I don't know, let's say, because we do like group projects in school, in our classes and I feel like that's like my strong subject. Like, I know school, I usually know like the subject matter and stuff like that. So we're in a group projects. I always speak up and like, out like, allocate the jobs of what we do for our project. So I feel like that one part where I feel like good about, like, speaking up for myself and speaking up for others when we are doing like academic work and stuff like that in the classroom, so that’s like the only time. 

00:53:20
Offer compliments 

00:53:20
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So what I'm feeling that not only in that context you are able to speak up and is your voice and say what you want but you're also a leader. Do you have some leadership skills and you're able to say, okay, I'm assigning the work and you can do this and that and things actually go well and people appreciate the way that you are leading them. So have you noticed before that you're actually a leader, that you have leadership skills? 

00:53:50
CAMILLE No. I feel like… 

00:53:50
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS How come? Nobody has told you that before? 

00:53:55
CAMILLE No, I feel like I've never thought about myself like that. 

00:53:55
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Oh, wow. I'm surprised. Because it's the first thing that came to my mind. It's like wow, you know, not only you're speaking up but you're are directing work, you're leading the assignments and things are going well. 

00:54:10
CAMILLE Umm... Wow, I never thought of that. 

00:54:10
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yeah. How does it feel to feel that, you know, you actually have some leadership skills that you haven't fully developed, but they are already working? 

00:54:20
CAMILLE Because I feel like I've never… Since I've never thought about that, I mean, now it feels empowering like I can go and lead people. But I just never thought about myself like that and no one's ever called me that. So… 

00:54:35
Identify exceptions to the problem 

00:54:35
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So, let's, let's find more examples for that. 

00:54:35
CAMILLE Okay. 

00:54:35
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Let's think about another situation in which you had some type of a leadership role. 

00:54:40
CAMILLE Okay. Umm... 

00:54:40
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Can be at home, at school, after school, anything. 

00:54:45
CAMILLE Umm... So I know I watch my little… When my little brother was littler, umm... I used to watch him a lot and we would go and I would like to lead him and like, my little cousins when we go to the park and stuff like that, so I'd be like in charge. So that's like the only other… I can think of. 

00:55:10
Offer compliments 

00:55:10
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yeah, I mean, good luck trying to manage a group of children, it's not easy. You know, I see the preschool teachers and they reckon them like wow. I don't think that if I could ever do that. I mean, it takes a lot of patience and structure and everything to be able to do that. 

00:55:20
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:55:25
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So you were, you were actually leading a group of children. How many? 

00:55:25
CAMILLE Umm... One of my little brother is only a few years younger than me. 

00:55:30
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay. 

00:55:30
CAMILLE Umm... But him and then my two other cousins. 

00:55:30
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay, so three children? 

00:55:30
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:55:35
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS At a park. 

00:55:35
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:55:35
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS That can get very rowdy and like, they can, right? And you were right there taking the position of the charge and leading the activities and being in charge of that? How does that that feel to… 

00:55:45
CAMILLE I mean, it's like… I felt like it's different. 

00:55:50
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yes. 

00:55:50
CAMILLE Just because it's like family. 

00:55:50
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yes. 

00:55:50
CAMILLE Umm... But I felt, I felt good, you know. I mean, I like being a boss and directing people. 

00:56:00
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yes. 

00:56:00
CAMILLE Umm... But it's also fun because I knew they would listen to me and I knew what was going to happen if I told them to do something or if I like gave them something to do, like, for us to do together, we would all listen and be like one. So it was easy for that, but… 

00:56:15
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS It was easy for you? 

00:56:15
CAMILLE For me, yeah. 

00:56:20
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Not for everybody is easy. Some people they just don't have those leadership skills, they just don’t see themselves or can't prove themselves as leader of the packs, they prefer to stay on the back and be left, but I'm seeing that there's something inside you that… 

00:56:35
CAMILLE It's like going. 

00:56:35
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS That ability and that skill and you are really young. So you're really at a beginning, you know, stages of learning to develop your leadership skills. So that sounds very, very befriend, than these or there version of yourself in which you are silencing yourself and then feeling the effects of that, that they are not working. So I wonder what is needed here? What do you think? 

00:57:00
CAMILLE I don’t know. I feel like I need to… I mean, I felt like I need to speak up for a while, I know, what's right. And then just not like think about the consequences of what's going to happen because at least I know what was right. 

00:57:20
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yes, because there's also a sense of not only speaking up, but it has to do with congruency, it has to do with, in the way like social justice, like doing the right thing. And you're feeling like "Hey, it's not worth to be talking to people like that." And if I were being silence, it doesn't feel good for me. And if I just continue skipping school because I don't, I wanted for you to like me, I'm also having the affects about that. 

00:57:45
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:57:50
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So you are becoming in a way an advocate for yourself and then advocate for others. 

00:57:55
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:57:55
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So not only do you have these leadership skills but you also have these strong sense of advocacy for yourself and for others because you're not only worrying about you. 

00:58:05
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:58:05
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS You're actually thinking about others and that’s also a quality that not everybody has. So I just wanna recognize that. 

00:58:15
CAMILLE Thank you. 

00:58:15
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So, to be able to advocate for yourself and for others. 

00:58:20
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:58:25
Scaling question to measure self-advocacy 

00:58:25
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So right now if we can name this umm... your label of… Let's say the number 10, you are that strong leader and advocate for yourself and for others. You're speaking up and you're standing for you know that what is right, that's Number 10. And number one, you're silencing yourself, you are full of fear for people not liking me or not wanting to hang out with me, you are not saying what you want, you are a follower and you are feeling very overwhelmed about, that's one. So from one to ten, where do you think that you are right now? 

00:59:10
CAMILLE Right now, I'm probably like, at one or two. 

00:59:15
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay, so it feels really, really low, okay because all of this has been accumulating. 

00:59:20
CAMILLE Yeah. 

00:59:20
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay. 

00:59:20
CAMILLE And I've been letting it happen for so long. 

00:59:20
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yes. Yes, so maybe one or two. 

00:59:25
CAMILLE Like right now. 

00:59:30
Identify client's motivation to make changes 

00:59:30
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yes, yes, I can see. Do you want to stay there? 

00:59:30
CAMILLE No. 

00:59:30
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS No? Okay. Where would you like to be umm... at the end of, I don't know let's say, let's make a plan for today. 

00:59:40
CAMILLE Today? 

00:59:45
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Uh-mmm… 

00:59:45
CAMILLE Umm... I probably want to be like a 10, but I mean I know I'm like reaching it. 

00:59:50
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay, okay, okay. 

00:59:50
CAMILLE Umm... But it's probably slowly. So it's not like I'm, so probably like a four or five. 

01:00:00
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay, so you would like to be able to meet, and may be not today, maybe that's, sort of a just say like, in short term of period and in that short period of time, do you like to go from my one or two to a, you say five or six? 

01:00:15
CAMILLE Yes. 

01:00:20
Identify specific actions to problem with grades 

01:00:20
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS One or two and five or six. So right now we're here and we wanna move here, right? So let's find out what do you feel that will help you to go from this one to three, five, six? Let's go to the next one. Let's go to the level three. 

01:00:45
CAMILLE Uh-mmm... I feel like umm... what I can do is, kind of be an advocate for myself first before I go and help other people. 

01:00:50
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yes. 

01:00:50
CAMILLE So the first thing I could do would be like just kind of tell my friends that I just want to be in school and they should probably stay to, just because we're missing so much, so we can just stay at school and go to school. 

01:01:05
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS That's huge. 

01:01:05
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:01:05
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS That’s huge. So you're advocating for yourself, but do you see what you did? You're not only advocating for yourself, you're also thinking about them and like, you're also missing a lot of school, so you're started advocating for others, right? So let's think about umm... That's right. So advocating for yourself and you have some specific examples of something that you could do. So umm... today is Friday, so you don't have school until…? 

01:01:35
CAMILLE Monday. 

01:01:35
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Monday. So when you go back on Monday and they say hey, this is boring, whatever, let's go to McDonalds and I'll get…. I don't know how you guys talk… 

01:01:45
CAMILLE Yeah, yeah. 

01:01:50
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS And so, far from high school now but… You know, when they are inviting you not to go to class. 

01:01:55
CAMILLE Umm... Like what? 

01:01:55
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Tell me again what you could say? 

01:01:55
CAMILLE I guess I'll say, I'm not hungry and I'd rather go to class and just learn since we're missing so much. 

01:02:05
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay. 

01:02:05
CAMILLE And then they may put more pressure on you because that’s a problem, the pressure, right? 

01:02:05
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:02:10
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS come on. Don't be, blah, blah, blah. 

01:02:10
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:02:15
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS What will you say? 

01:02:15
CAMILLE I could just… At that point I probably would just walk away instead of like be in confrontation. 

01:02:20
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Nice. 

01:02:20
CAMILLE Because I don't like confrontation. 

01:02:20
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yes, no, and you don't have to. You just have to find whatever works for you. 

01:02:25
CAMILLE Yeah, that's true. 

01:02:25
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Wow, that's great. So you would just walk away and say like, okay, I'll talk to you later, I'm not gonna give out… 

01:02:35
CAMILLE Yeah, and go to class. 

01:02:35
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay. Wow. That's great. So this is very umm… clear something that, you know, will you be able to give this a try as an experiment and see how it goes? 

01:02:45
CAMILLE Yeah. Yeah, I'm kind of scared but… 

01:02:45
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay. Okay. 

01:02:50
CAMILLE I mean, I can try. 

01:02:50
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Does it feel like too much? Should we break it down a little bit? 

01:02:55
CAMILLE I know, I'm like, we're just jumping right into it. But I mean, I feel like, umm... I can probably start by just speaking up to like, just start talking them about school being important and just starting that conversation with them. 

01:03:05
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yes. 

01:03:05
CAMILLE And so they are right at the back like, just walking away. 

01:03:10
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay, so that's a good idea. So not waiting until that movement that you may have to say no. 

01:03:15
CAMILLE Uh-huh. 

01:03:15
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS But right when you see them or before that, you speak up and say, how is that, school is important to you. 

01:03:25
CAMILLE Uh-huh. 

01:03:25
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So what could you say, you know, in, in the language that you use with your friends? 

01:03:30
CAMILLE Umm... I probably just start by like talking about homework that’s due, that I know that they have as well. 

01:03:35
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay. 

01:03:35
CAMILLE Just start making the conversation and if they keep saying like no that's stupid or something, like, I can just keep time like let them be. Like, it's important to me. I wanna have like good grades, so we can keep playing basketball and stuff like that. 

01:03:50
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Uh-huh. And this is umm... I'm gonna give you. These notes aren't for you, just, it help me to write it down. It's important umm... to meet you said? 

01:04:00
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:04:00
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS And again you are advocating for yourself. 

01:04:05
CAMILLE Uh-huh. 

01:04:05
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS You're using your voice to advocate for yourself and even though they say, whatever, blah, blah, blah. You say like well, it may not be important for you, but is important for me. 

01:04:15
CAMILLE Uh-huh. 

01:04:15
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS And I'm worrying about this homework. 

01:04:20
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:04:20
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS And I do want to get it done. 

01:04:25
CAMILLE Good, yeah and get good grades. 

01:04:25
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS And I do wanna get good grades. And why do you wanna get good grades? 

01:04:30
CAMILLE So we can graduate, keep playing basketball, hopefully move on. 

01:04:35
Identify specific actions to problem with people being called names 

01:04:35
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay, okay. So speaking up, saying what's important to you and advocating for yourself. Those are important would takes towards this direction? 

01:04:40
CAMILLE Yeah. Yeah. 

01:04:45
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS And something a little bit, I'm just gonna, because you said that you have two different problematic areas, right? Umm... One was about the grades and we saw that it was because you were missing school and that we're identifying some specific things that you could do to avoid missing your class, right? 

01:05:00
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:05:00
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS And the other one was umm... in this context with some things that your friends were doing and you didn’t like in terms of calling other people's names. So in that moment, it seems and you don't have to do it right now. I just wanna get an idea of something that could be an option whenever you feel ready to do that, right? So if you're thinking about being an advocate for yourself and for others, if you're in that situation, why is that happening you're saying, what context, like the lunch tables, like recess? 

01:05:30
CAMILLE Like, yeah like sometimes well we have like a break. 

01:05:35
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay. 

01:05:35
CAMILLE Like between third and fourth I think and then we have lunch time. So I feel like its people that passed by and they wanna pick on them or they can say stuff to me, but they don't necessarily hear it but it still makes me feel uncomfortable. 

01:05:45
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Okay. So even if other person is not hearing that because they are telling that to you, they are something in you that want's to so say, I'm not agreeing with you. 

01:06:00
CAMILLE Yeah, so I just kind of, I think I could just be like well, that's not really something nice to say or like, because I mean I don't want to be mean back to them and be like, oh, well, you're that way too or something, like… 

01:06:10
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Yes, yes. 

01:06:10
CAMILLE I just feel like I could say something to stick up for them instead of or just say like oh, that's not nice you shouldn't say that. And if you wanna say that then you can probably tell somebody else because… 

01:06:20
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Oh, wow, that’s really strong. 

01:06:25
CAMILLE I know, but it's like scary but I mean that's what I didn't want to say. 

01:06:25
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS I know, I know, but just been able to visualize want you want to say that's step one. 

01:06:30
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:06:30
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS You're doing it right now. 

01:06:35
CAMILLE Uh-Huh… I'm daunting but… 

01:06:35
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS But, but do you know what I'm saying that umm... and its part of developing these leadership skills. A leader, an advocate doesn’t have to come across in that confrontational way. 

01:06:45
CAMILLE Uh-Huh. 

01:06:50
Summarize and validate client's strengths 

01:06:50
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So what I'm hearing right now is that you have natural leadership skills that you are discovering right now, right? 

01:07:00
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:07:00
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS And that you also an advocate for yourself and for others and that's something that is part of who you are. And when you are silencing that it doesn't feel good. If it's overwhelming, it feels stressful, something is not right. So you're learning how to be able to give voice to these umm... advocate that you are, but there's something that was holding you back that was related to fear, right? Like, you don't want to be confrontational. 

01:07:30
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:07:30
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So I was thinking about another, you're learning that you're a natural leader and I'm sure that you hopefully are gonna be looking more into how to develop leadership skills and all of that. You're gonna find that a leader doesn't have to be confrontational, doesn't have to be aggressive. Actually, those type of leaders are not the most effective leaders. 

01:07:55
CAMILLE Uh-Huh. 

01:07:55
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS So learning how to be the leader that you're in a non-confrontational way and you're giving me great examples. 

01:08:05
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:08:05
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS Right? So when they're telling you hey, umm… let's go to McDonald's, whatever, skip the class. Like, hey, I'm not hungry yet, but blah, blah, blah. Like, hey, you know, this is really important for me and I really want to get this done. 

01:08:15
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:08:20
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS I really want to graduate because I want to keep playing basketball and this is part of my goals. Without being confrontational. So you're just naming what's important to you. And when you are at the break and they may be saying something to you that's feels mean about other people and it's not feeling right to you, instead of staying silent, you can may say, umm... You're saying something like, well, do you know that sounds mean, I don't really like hearing that. And if you wanna say that, you can tell that to somebody else. 

01:08:55
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:08:55
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS That was strong… 

01:08:55
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:08:55
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS But it was like, hey, you know, like I'm using my voice. 

01:09:00
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:09:00
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS And it doesn't have to be this huge change from one day to the next one, right? It's just like finding these little ways in which you can continue putting in practice and showing to the world the leader and the advocate that you are, that's great. So great meeting you. And, you know, I'm thinking about umm... talking to you in five years from now and just learning about all the things that you have done for yourself and for others, because I think that you're gonna be that type of person, you're that type of person. 

01:09:35
CAMILLE Thank you so much. 

01:09:35
MAYUMI YAMANAKA DOUGLASS You're welcome. Great meeting you.

Post-sessions Review 

01:09:45
LUCIE Hi, Camille. 

01:09:50
CAMILLE Hi. 

01:09:50
LUCIE Umm... As you know I'm Lucie and I'm the producer of this project and umm... if you don't mind I'd like to ask you a couple of questions about this. You've been very brave to meet with these three different counselors. Umm... Does anything initially come up for you that you wanna say about that experience of meeting with three different people? Did you notice a difference or… 

01:10:15
CAMILLE Yes. 

01:10:15
LUCIE You did? 

01:10:15
CAMILLE I, yeah. I feel like I noticed a difference between after they all went and I feel like the two, the two last ones they kind of was more confident and like, I felt better walking away I guess with my, you know, problems. Umm... I feel like the first one was just like talking answer. Like, it wasn't really getting deep into like problematic stuff or like emotions and stuff like that. 

01:10:45
LUCIE Okay, the narrative, that was the first one and then the second two were, you don't need to know this but CBT and umm... and solution focused. So, yeah, anyhow so… Okay, excellent. Umm... Was there one particular one that you noticed was the best fit for you or so you're just to be clear and please correct me if I'm not getting it right, right, but you umm... noticed that after the last two, you did you say you felt better, is that the language you used? 

01:11:15
CAMILLE Like, I feel like we addressed not only like my problems but like a tool for me to walk away with and actually use them in my everyday life to not fix them, but like help that. 

01:11:25
LUCIE Yeah. Well, you can want to fix them if you want to. 

01:11:30
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:11:30
LUCIE Yeah, yeah, yeah. Umm... Excellent, okay. It sounds good. Umm... Was there any particular one that you thought were a good, was a good fit for you or…? 

01:11:45
CAMILLE Umm... I liked the second one because it gave me like a visual because I'm a visual learner umm... and it gave me like the roots of my problems. How I felt with them, like my emotion, my thoughts and then how to umm... like, tool or like outcomes that were coming from my thoughts and stuff like that. So I kind of knew the roots of the problem, how I was feeling and then how my actions were in reflect, in like response to my feelings and thoughts and stuff like that. 

01:12:15
LUCIE Wow. Yeah, you really got that one. 

01:12:20
CAMILLE Yeah, that one was good. 

01:12:20
LUCIE Because you came like, yeah, say right back exactly what happened and that isn't always the case. So that's the meeting with Sarah, the CBT one, yeah. 

01:12:25
CAMILLE A reciprocal. 

01:12:30
LUCIE Awesome. Umm... It had the visual aspect of it too, right? Umm... Each one had somewhat of a visual aspect whether it was notes or something that, but that had a particular drawing and you noticed the roots part? 

01:12:40
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:12:45
LUCIE Yeah. 

01:12:45
CAMILLE I feel like the way that she said it and the way that it came across, like it was just, like perfect. 

01:12:50
LUCIE Yeah. 

01:12:50
CAMILLE I think it worked. It really resonated with me. I don’t know. 

01:12:50
LUCIE Yeah. Well, it's always, there's always a different approach for every one that fits best, you know. Umm... But that was my question, which one fits best? So you answered that. Yeah. Umm... Were there any questions that stood out to you in any of the sessions that umm... you feel like you liked or didn't like umm...? 

01:13:10
CAMILLE Umm... I feel like in the last one that we did umm... the beginning of it was kind of like, oh, what do you wanna talk about and at first I was like well, I don't really know what to talk about but I can throw out some of my problems and see which one sticks, you know, it's just kind of… I feel… I felt it was awkward to start off like that but, I mean… 

01:13:35
LUCIE Because you got the chance to or you were given the option to what do we wanna talk about today? 

01:13:40
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:13:40
LUCIE Yeah. 

01:13:40
CAMILLE So it's weird. I wasn't expecting that I guess. The other ones I feel like they more directed it to where they wanted to kind of focus rather than just putting me on the spot, I guess. 

01:13:55
LUCIE Okay, yeah, and that works better for you when they're more directive than… 

01:14:00
CAMILLE Yeah, I feel like… Well, again, I like the second one the best the way she like… She asked me questions and then I answered and then she would kind of go deeper into the answer. 

01:14:10
LUCIE Yeah. 

01:14:10
CAMILLE Rather than just well, what do you want to talk about because like, she… The second one she mentioned my mom and what my mom's concerns were rather than my concerns or why do I think I'm here for counseling and stuff like that. 

01:14:25
LUCIE Okay, excellent. Well, that's good to know. I think you've answered this question but I'll just ask it in, again in a different way in case but umm... What was the most helpful to you do you think umm... out of these three sessions? 

01:14:45
CAMILLE Umm... Well, I feel like number two and number three were the most helpful because I feel like number three, she like pointed out characteristics in myself that I didn't think about before and it kind of like empowered me and encouraged me o go out and make like subtle differences that would make an overall difference in my life. 

01:15:05
LUCIE Yeah, the leadership and that she pointed out your leadership skills that you didn't hadn't recognize so clearly or, yeah. 

01:15:10
CAMILLE It's like me just describing myself without that, like, title on it, she then pointed that in myself. So I feel like that was really nice. Umm... And then like I said before the second one with the visual and knowing where my feelings actually come from and then that's what triggers me to make actions in my life and decisions. And if I just kind of like go back and realize that I can more control it and control like the different decisions that I make. So those were the two best one's I think. 

01:15:45
LUCIE Excellent. Umm... In the first session he was talking a lot about the relationships between people, is that right? And like your relationships with your mom and umm... with your step mom and your dad and your brother and your sister and kind of trying to get umm... to the bottom of those things first, where the others just kind of jumped right into the… 

01:16:05
CAMILLE Yeah, it's like a specific. 

01:16:10
LUCIE Solution. Yeah. 

01:16:10
CAMILLE Specific problem and then a solution. Yeah, I feel like the other one, the first one, the narrative you said… 

01:16:15
LUCIE Yeah. 

01:16:15
CAMILLE Was umm... more just kind of learning I guess about me, not really specific problems just like what I found was like priority one and why I felt like there was an imbalance or balance in my life which kind of… It was good to kind of realize and be like challenged with. Well, what do you think is balance or imbalance? But umm... I don't know, I just didn't feel like I really walked away with anything. I just felt like, well, I sat there and talked and I tried to think about what balance is but I didn't, I didn't feel like it really helped me a lot. 

01:16:55
LUCIE Yeah. So you like umm... But what I hear you saying is this right is that you like kind of the session that has a take away? 

01:17:00
CAMILLE Yeah. 

01:17:00
LUCIE Umm... a tangible something kind of solid that you can work on the next week or yeah… Well, that's good to know. 

01:17:05
CAMILLE My goals are… Like, the third one was also goal oriented, like she gave us scaling. 

01:17:10
LUCIE Yeah. 

01:17:10
CAMILLE And she gave like well where are you right now, what's your ultimate goal and then, like, can you get here within the next like few days or like how can you do implement those changes to reach your goal. So far that was really interesting. 

01:17:25
LUCIE Yeah. 

01:17:25
CAMILLE Really good. 

01:17:30
LUCIE Excellent. Umm... Anything else you wanna say about it? 

01:17:35
CAMILLE I don’t think so. 

01:17:35
LUCIE Any… Okay. All right. Well, thank you so much for participating in this. We so greatly appreciate it. 

01:17:40
CAMILLE It was… It was interesting.
