00:01:35
BRYAN EVANS Thank you. 

00:01:35
JUSTIN IDLEBURG Thank you. 

00:01:35
THOM PANCELLA So Bryan let start with you. Ah, what led to your studying suicide among African Americans? 

00:01:45
Bryan Evans 

00:01:45
BRYAN EVANS One of the major reasons for, ah, me choosing this is a part of my (inaudible ), my studies but even prior to attending, ah, Washington University was the fact that in the-- when we talk suicide among (inaudible ) communities, African American is one of those areas that, ah, is not believe that there's, ah, incidence, ah, there's, ah, even among their culture there is, ah, among those of us in the culture there is not a belief that there is an incidence of suicide. So, ah, as persons knowing me in social services and, ah, would start to, ah, talk about my studies or start to talk about the work that I was doing in suicide prevention, ah, I, I had a lot of people, ah, particularly tell me about family members that will said me too but I don't know what to do. Or what avenues or there any supports out there. And that generated, ah, ah, a need both personally as well as for a community to educate about the incidence of suicide. What are the warning signs? What are the, ah, accesses to, ah, or access to help that's available, ah, those are-- in terms of the die or name particularly in the community in regards to, ah, particular agencies such as boys and girls clubs, educational institutions, ah, the faith based community all of those places where, ah, African Americans, ah, oftentimes we, ah, we need, we fellowship, we have activities, ah, and so we see this symptoms being played out in, ah, in front of us but were not certainly how to intervene. 

00:03:15
THOM PANCELLA I, I think that, that most people hear about violent deaths in the African American community being were homicide related so what you're saying is suicide is more prevalent than we really know about. 

00:03:25
BRYAN EVANS Suicide the 11th leading cause of death, ah, in our nation. Homicide is a 15th leading cause of death. There are more suicides and homicides and most of us don't even aware that because on the news when you hear oftentimes it said there, there was this murder or there was this event that occur, ah, oftentimes when it comes to suicide in, in particular among African Americans and in African American males in general, ah, I mean specifically, ah, there is the-- there is the incidence of suicide that occurs and the symptoms of again being played out and we're not noticing them. Oftentimes, because the stigma around suicide, a suicide can occur on attempt to occur and then, ah, it's almost taboo is almost like somewhat shamed of course for our family member to say I had, ah, relative to that by suicide, or I myself made an attempt all my life. So there, there this-- there's this part of us that recognized that didn't occurs but there's a part of us they just, just not want to talk about it, there's a part of us that even that stigmatization prevent us from getting help. But suicide is a prevalent, ah, cause of death. Now we among African Americans but why Americans native of Alaskan and na tive Americans, ah, latino population, ah, is one of the incidence that we in particular in (inaudible ) groups we are not paying attention. 

00:04:46
THOM PANCELLA You break it down, uhm, look at the occu-- occurence in like 14 to 24 year olds. 

00:04:55
BRYAN EVANS Fourteen to 24 year old, basically if just go back for-- but as, as the third leading cause of death for adolescence there's anyone age of 10 to 24 years of age, and for African Americans we-- were the same as the third leading cause of death for some, ah, someone be a-- between the ages of 14 years of age to 24 years of age. But if we look at that in terms of the middle school student, ah, in middle child whose between 10 to 14 years of age it still the third leading cause of death. Uhm, African American males have a higher percentage or a higher rate of death in suicide, ah, than African American females. Ah, African American males die five to one in comparison. That's greater in it-- in particular among adolescence than any other in terms of race than any culture or race that we've seen. Ah, that's staggering when you think of that in comparison that African American males die by suicide five to one. Ah, African American males we also know that they, ah, comprise, ah, ah, greater percent about 30, ah, 6% or more of those who in cause rated. Ah, by the time in adolescent, ah, reaches the age of 24 years to 36 years there are greater incidence of being involved in criminal activity or in the law system. Ah, in some effort these are also the areas oftentimes when you see other things that are going on that psycho social factors they may, ah, ah, lend itself for someone to be at risk of suicide but someone maybe at risk in terms of a, a-- incarceration they maybe, ah, if, if they have been incarcerated makes them a greater risk for other factors that might lead them self and shown warning signs of depression, ah, warning signs of anxiety disorders, ah, ah, warning signs of the symptoms, ah, that leave themselves of warning signs of, ah, of a suicide attempt. So we need to cognitive of this community because we see the signs and symptoms all around this but we're not aware. 

00:06:55
THOM PANCELLA On addition to working with the Independence Center and having then diagnosed with bipolar disorder we do know that Justin himself has attempted suicide twice - 

00:07:05
JUSTIN IDLEBURG Yes. 

00:07:05
THOM PANCELLA - one well in college and one's well in your mid-20s. Can you tell us a little bit about your experience? 

00:07:10
Justin Idleburg 

00:07:10
JUSTIN IDLEBURG Well, first I'm attempt I was, uhm, a student in a state university year, uhm, I feel like the way my world was on my shoulders, uhm, if I like had a lot of expectations in which I didn't-- I didn't wanna take point into, uhm, expectations such as from my family, my friends and my community you know, people had always told me I'll be great person but in time that's not want I to be. I wanted to have I would say I'm more of, ah, any of how type college experience but that's not what was my vision for me. So I would that I kind of buckles and depress you get to me and I decided one day to take sort a lot of Advil. And my friend you know, there's-- they came in the room after the dawn whatever they don't know at campus they say we continue to take them and so they took it about my head and I told them you, you know, you can't stop what I'm doing. Uhm, there was like men you know, life doesn't have to go this way. Uhm, so I had tried you know, I have found after the rest of my friends I had made it down to a bridge that's have race to campus over a lagoon, and I tried that jumped off the bridge was those prior to more 3 feet fill of water. Uhm, but I thought that they are quick and easy death and they are won't, uhm, feel it burn on me anymore and my friend kind on my age and said a lot of great things to me to help me to stop doing that, you know, I went to the hospital and get my stomach pump in. When I came back to campus and another (inaudible ) are very supportive of, uhm, of my feelings of what I have been going through. The administration also helps me out so, uhm, that's will about that. 

00:09:00
THOM PANCELLA I know but that, ah, later on when you're on your 20s? 

00:09:00
JUSTIN IDLEBURG Uhm, well, at that time I was, uhm, I been went of very deep state of depression base of, ah, I had I was working in a law firm that the job I had left and, uhm, I just turn see actually in myself away from friends and family that I won't go thanksgiving. Uhm, and I like-- I like to be very social so I lock myself in a room play video games and read a lot. And I also found out that I wouldn't go to sleep I never-- I never thought there was a problem that I wouldn't go sleep. Uhm, but one, one dark day came I was just like tired of everything you know, I came to the point where at all call my mother and my friends told me you know, I had good run. You know, I told my mother I feel like I was a disappoint to her and, uhm, that I let her down. All the hard work she put into me that I was not able to live what to what she had wanted me to be. Uhm, you know, I told my friends you know, I, I won't be here anymore they started you know, start to call and follow back and forth, uhm, and at that time I was loading a gun you know to go downstairs and I ex-- my grandmother and my sister to leave I told them I need to be around this you know they had to screaming and hallowing and going outside and, uhm, next thing I know I'd got a, uhm, call from the so again from squad captain from seven district, here were the police department. And, uhm, he try t o talk to me about a similar situation that he had but at that time I was really tried to hear what he had to say, you know, because I strongly felt that there was no really point for me living anymore. I got to-- I think that prior be the deepest, darkest and most harmful time in my life. Uhm, but some came to I had to say, ah, ah, very bright raves such came through for me was my one of my very good friends from (inaudible ) he came, he was outside and, uhm, he called on telephone he had told me you know, men I love you and an African American community mean and maybe some family members don't, don't share their words that's enough. You know, that, that led me to come out the house you know, uhm, and so I load the gun and the police cop and then ask me to come out and when I came said, you'll my friend and hug I've never like hug any males not my uncles, my father any of that so for me my friend do that I was like a very I guess a breaking point. If that really good you know, and, uhm, continues to help, help me now and support and I think there something that a person has doing I got, ah, need you need a big support from friends and family to make it through this. 

00:11:40
THOM PANCELLA Bryan I see you not in your head a lot you, you hearing some things, ah, in what Justin talking about respond a little bit to some of the things that you, you are hearing in, in the back of the story. 

00:11:55
BRYAN EVANS I think his story is, ah, for anyone who has may an attempt on a life you go-- you gonna see some similarities. One is the isolation, ah, from family and friends, ah, the feeling of burdensome, feeling that, ah, the perceive burdensome that I am somehow burden on my family or burden to my fri-- ah, friends or, ah, that life is use-- useless or I, ah, it-- you know, their pessimistic attitude oftentimes person who are thinking about taking their life, ah, have, ah, have lost the joy or seize for life. But it's a more than just, ah, a feeling, it's more than just a blue mood or punk. It is you know, a there are best of loneliness and separation, ah, ah, feeling isolated from the world even in the middle of a crowd. The other part of that, ah, that Justin was talking about was that, ah, making statement you know, when he start to take the pills and his friends that his friends were around, ah, there's, ah, there's a belief that oftentimes, ah, a persons who were-- ah, take who were thinking about taking their life will, ah, not make they are no warning signs but there are warning signs all around and one of the things the isolation the other part is being actively engaged and talk about that, actively engaged in making, ah, visible signs in taking their life. Uhm, the other part of the one that I think the most, most safe-- significant one was when he talk about he in his, ah, mid 20s when he was, ah, taking us thinking about taking his life in made the attempt was the fact of, ah, having a gun. African Americans died by guns far greater in terms of percentages than any other racial group. Ah, we had access to guns, we are more likely to have hand guns in our homes, ah, to have hand guns are access to hand guns. And, ah, a study done by the Harvard, ah, public health, ah, by Harvard Public Health, ah, talks about the fact in their means matter campaign is the fact that, ah, the gun in the hands of an adolescents is more likely to belong to a family member or a parents, ah, in regards to that. Oftentimes there is a short term crisis that, ah, ah, is, is proceeded in attempt on someone's life or there are other crisis that you know, in terms of han-- handling that particular event or in our life but the thought of suicide occurred long before those attempts. They occurred, uhm, you know, for, you know, oftentimes they thoughts, thoughts he may have been there in the teens. Ah, he, he talk about the fact that he was in college the first time he made an attempt on his life. The other part of that is for many persons who'd made an attempt, ah, in particular, ah, adolescents you are a high school in those college age which is the college age is-- you know person between the ages of 20, 24 years and even those, ah, of the some mid-20s 25 years, ah, that's when we have had, uhm, less parental control, we've had more, ah, ability to control our own lives. And then also because we are in that adult, ah, face of our life we are also more isolated from those family members and caregivers. But there are always signs there and that's when, when you talk about his, ah, ah, a friend calling him and say, hey I love you, ah, that, that someone stepping in and say no you're not a burden. That someone stepping in and say no I'm concern about you and I'm here for you. Ah, and then being there, ah, after the event you talk about the same and it would have been one thing if you just made the statement on the day when the crisis were there but , ah, Justin I talk about this instead of talk about being committed to him while he was in treatment. Being committed to him while he was, ah, even in you know, out long after that. Someone who is thinking about suicide and whose made an attempt on their life. But they made one attempt in particular if there's not been an intervention or treatment there more likely to make another attempt on their life. Ah, or there are a greater risk let me say that way. The other part of that when appropriate intervention is there and not just by the our mental health community but by family and friends who surround us person as a support their less likely to make an attempt on their life one's those support on their. Ah, ah, there are more likely to continue in taking care of themselves. This is a 100% guarantee we only wishing where. But the other part of that s by someone stepping in a friend, stepping in and saying I'm concerned about you, I care about and I'm here in this place. Ah, means that these person has another resource someone whose there, who someone whose not afraid to deal with it. Deal with the real issues and that burdensome if you will that perception, ah, that a bits of pain in psychological pain becomes lessen because someone else is entered in. And that's what we use a community have to do and, and being, ah, involve, ah, Justin also talk about one of the thing that comes in mind was that in addition to family and friends being there and addition to the police being there and trying to intervene it was the fact that someone else came in and made a connection with him. Uhm, what, what we do know and this is now even true to the African Americans but it's true for, for, ah, ah, every racial group in every community that, ah, oftentimes we will seek out, uhm, someone whose close to us will talk to someone who is close to us about our thought of suicide rather than our initial response going to a clinician and saying, "Hey I'm thinking about it." So I thinking about taking my life and, and those of us who work in a clinical field we know that sometimes will ask those questions, ah, doing an assessment and, ah, the person may not be as, as completely honest for a number different reasons. But when someone who is close to that person a family member has this you know what I'm recognizing this warning signs. Ah, I'm recognizing this, this things. Ah, are you thinking about suicide there are more at to talk about it with someone who they feel they have a relationship or they are confident in and that also can be the catalyst for help. Particularly among African Americans because all of us had that extended family, ah, environment. Many in our communities where we have, ah, big mama and you know, papa and all those persons who were close to us or even on those of us who play football, we talk about our culture, we go back to our high school and we talk our teacher. So all those-- all those persons who are gate keepers, there are-- they are caregivers, ah, for us and they are gatekeepers. And when they are able to recognized a signs and intervene it lessens the probability that are violent death will occurred through suicide. 

00:18:50
THOM PANCELLA That's were I think we need to go with conversation. Ah, Justin what, what do you think you told people ahead of your attempt? How do you think you may have projected to people told people that, that you think that, that there are problems going on. 

00:19:05
JUSTIN IDLEBURG I think but the isolation I think that's the biggest one because, uhm, it's very hard for me to a person who knows-- who knows me very best to see me not wanna go out in party, happy hours, or you know, anytime for functions. You know, I just say no or not even answer the phone at all. You know, my cellphone ring, I just turned it off, you know, uhm, nobody came about it , nobody came back the house or anything like that you know, there was a call to the house from my grandmother was saying, you know, Justin a telephone call I just act I was sleep. You know, she come on my room I just look at her, keep on the TV and she just say that you know, his busy or he has wanna talk. So I think those are the signs that let people know but my grandmother she is prior about 70 at that time she doesn't know much about, uhm, mental health and the signs that, uhm, that occur when a persons going through some dramatic situations like that, uhm, so but I think you people educated little more about the signs and a symptoms they would be able to have the family members are a little bit more. 

00:20:15
THOM PANCELLA Let's go through some of that. Let's talk about some of those who already gone down this path a little bit now. Let's talk about what particular people might be able to look for and be able to see. 

00:20:25
BRYAN EVANS One of the things in terms of, uhm, knowing about, ah, the, the warning signs of suicide and the warning of depression we, we often hear one of those warning signs, ah, ah, depression we hear the term depression but we don't know what depression is. Ah, when you hear those thoughts, ah, someone has a pessimatic-- pessimistic outlook on life where they feel thing seen and fear to hopeless. Have you noticed, ah, a change in appetite, have you noticed that their eating more or that they're eating less or not eating at all. have you noticed that they're sleeping patterns have changed. Where they sleep all the time. Or they haven't sum it they are not able to sleep. Have you noticed, ah, talk about death or suicide, have you noticed those things. Have you, ah, noticed that there are changes in terms of their-- the way they care for themselves. Uhm, ah, you know, once they were taking care of themselves but now, they, they ma y not beginning to haircut on, they may not be combing their hair their getting themselves stress, Do they find it hard to go on with the activities of the day. Uhm, have you noticed also, ah, in regards that they have her inability, ah, asking how's your day going. And, and they respond with, ah, with some, ah, some anger or rage or they have trouble focusing. They have trouble thinking or concentrating. All of these or often are the warning signs of-- or not warning signs these are symptoms of depression. A clinician would look for five or more those symptoms occurring over two week period, ah, but for any person if we see one of these symptoms, ah, it's important for us to look closer and to maybe ask what's going with these person. Oftentimes, African Americans are don't exhibit enough of the depression symptoms to be, ah, to be diagnosed with depression. However, oftentimes they have other symptoms that lead into be, ah, an anxiety disorder or they or more likely to have, ah, situations in the life short term crisis, ah, in which they respond. So oftentimes the way we respond while we, we may exhibit only a few with the depression symptoms they are other things they might be there. Ah, how do we handle, ah, how do we cope? Have you noticed they were using drugs. Have you noticed that were, uhm, ah, that there's involvement in other activities, ah, risky behaviors. Ah, other things to be paying attention to, are there, ah, fights with families and friends and you know, in, in terms of that have they become irritable. Some of these things are, are in play when someone maybe thinking about that and not just the you know, in terms of being, ah, angry or violent or aggressive or substance abuse. But again the, the isolation the, ah, they stop-- they stop socializing with families and friends. Those are important, important things that to recognized. One of the things Justin just say was said no one came to the house. Sometimes we will see someone going through something and the, the response is will they get through it. Or the response is I don't know what to say. And sometimes that's just the most important part to just knock on the door and say "Hey, what's going on? Let's have a conversation, how you're feeling?" and when you see that not being afraid of asking that question are you thinking about suicide. Ninety percent there's a research that talks about 90% of persons who are, ah, thinking about suicide or 90% in greater who are, ah, thinking about suicide will evidence it in some way by something they said or something they will do. So when we see this symptoms, when we see this warning signs is important to pay attention to it. They will verbalized it oftentimes it may not come out and say well I'm thinking about taking my life I'm thinking about I'm kill-- ah, thinking about killing myself or I just that sometimes think I, I what would it be like if I just didn't wake up. Life is just too hard. Ah, painful experience I had someone that's, ah, talk about an incident and say ask, ah, a family member, ah, had you thought about killing yourself and the response was, ah, I never thought about doing it but I think about it the time. And it was a first time someone I ever ask that person had you ever thought about taking your life? Ah, ah, sometimes I just don't wanna be here, ah, some of those, those final, ah, those worst that we hear that talk about some finality in their life that life is coming to a clause. Ah, and then oftentimes the interventions is the most important part, ah, oftentimes there's a fear if I ask them about suicide there somehow I'm gonna plan the idea of suicide. Ah, I'd like it to same thing is, is in terms of like sex. You don't have to talk to someone about sex they not know if they're thinking about it, it, it just-- it's there. And suicide is not as such a rare occurrence that we don't know that it happens. So the first time as, ah, ah, someone asking about suicide it's not the first time they thought about it and it really does not plan the idea what it does is show that you have been paying attention to the pain of that person that's in. Suicide in many cases most cases is not about death, it's not about ending the la-- ah, ending life is about ending the emotional pain in the deva station emotional factors that are feel in my life. Ah, how do I intervene? The other part there Tom and let me flip this is that when you have that conversation with that persons to, to offer them hope I'm concern about you I want you to live. Ah, I love you, ah, in let, let's go get some help I'll go with you. If you need me to go to the hospital with you, I'll go with you. I'll stand by you. Oftentimes, you tell someone, uhm, well if you go to you know, go to the hospital you go see a clinician and because of the stigma oftentimes we won't seek out help. But if I know that someone is there with me and say I'll be here with you, I'm gonna go to the hospital with you I'll go and see a clinician will go talk with someone. Will go talk to our pastor, ah, will go talk to-- will call the suicide crisis line together I'll be here with you let's and you know call. If you're not gonna call, I'll call you and you can talk to him. Uhm, I used to work for a crisis line, I know they when someone else intervenes on behalf of that person there, there with him even when they, they most help, ah, ah, resistant they have found that help to be, ah, a life changing of then in their life like you said, with your friend whose that end. That is oftentimes been the, the catalyst for that person coming out of that their best and seeking help. So what's important for us to know how to properly intervene. 

00:27:10
JUSTIN IDLEBURG If I may ask something on about the, the friends and family are expected is so much greater than people that you even know because from my own situation I know that if I not have my, my cousin and my friends come visit was, uhm, I'm seeking to see me for about three weeks, uhm, I prior that because I was not there, ah, by the stage can stand I could have just told them I was to leave and resi-- so I had to cycle all over because prior of that I have been to the hospital two or three other times before I had got to the stage of uhm, I was a have, have done this. I had the hospital gave me medicine they told me to take it I was like, ah, nuns are all of me and then African American community you are thought that are you not crazy just go and through something you know, ah, I only need medicine you don't need this. You know, ah, you know they talk about you know, family pride you know, you come from a long line of men to like this you know, you don't need this. You know, but without those supports friends , family and great treatment none of-- none of the rebirth that a person goes through is even possible. Are you a person, ah, by not helping is kind of worst on the problem I would say it is. Uhm, and we all need someone and some important time in my life it may not be as, uhm, to my extent but maybe you may at least may you have pay your gas bill like will do take other times. And you calling a friend for that you know, in, in my world you do need friends and family and also places like the Independence Center that helps you get your life back on track will give a great opportunities. 

00:28:50
THOM PANCELLA Who needs to-- who needs t learn to watch for things? Who are they, who are the people who can watch? 

00:29:00
BRYAN EVANS Ah, you heard me I use a word caregivers. Caregivers or anyone who impacts the life of someone else I remember since we're talking about and we trained will follow this is the, ah, suicide PREV training and we do, ah, ah, adolescent and gatekeepers. Ah, a gatekeeper or the, the caregiver is any person who impacts a life of someone so that's a parent that is, ah, a teacher, that is a clergy in the faith based community that is, ah, the coach that is any one who is actively about those are-- those of us who are in social services, those of us who are clinician, ah, it's anyone who impacts the life. This training, ah, oftentimes and those of us in the professional field oftentimes we think of it as, okay, this is my client. But 86% of parents who have had a child to, ah, die by suicide were unaware that their child was at the serious point of crisis where they were take life. So that means 86% of clinicians 86% of, ah, of police officers, 86% of, ah, clergy who had a child to died about suicide, 86%. So that's not only the person who is who I work with. It's also the child in my family. It's also, ah, the, the you know, that again they are extended family. It's anyone who impacts. Everyone needs to know how to improperly intervene. Everyone needs to know whether those crisis numbers. They need to know their access to crisis intervention line or EC guidelines, ah, in Missouri. Ah, in saint Louis is behavior health response, ah, everyone needs to know, the, ah, national suicide prevention number 1 800 273 talk or they need to know how to access the life crisis. You know, these are numbers that are helpful. Ah, we need to know in terms of being able to intervene, ah, what are the warning signs. But then one of those resources that I need to help. Ah, if I need if I go to the hospital you need to know that oftentimes a person while they were, ah, in the high point of taking their life, ah, thinking about suicide. And then oftentimes when you take them to hospital oftentimes they will they were-- they're not that high so they might be release from care. But with that is going to come a care packet you need to follow up with that care packet. And that may even in the hands of that person. So we're gonna continue from this day go on and continue and to see treatment we're gonna go on and seek help. Uhm, if you're not aware those resources and what those resources are mental health America of Eastern Missouri, ah, we're available and we can offer you now only training and through grant funded by the Missouri Foundation for Health we're able to go throughout this simple of Missouri to any school or any agency or any family, ah, there's no to-- there's not, ah, gra-- an audience that's too large or, ah, audience is too small. Ah, I've had an audience of one and I've had an audience of 170 people. Uhm, in regards to knowing how to air properly intervene and help someone. Ah, in terms of being able to now recognized the warning signs but then one of those resources that are available to me. 

00:32:20
THOM PANCELLA You guys are both talk about stigma. Tells about the role that, that, that stigma played in your world and then how we kind of deal with that? 

00:32:30
JUSTIN IDLEBURG Well, in my life stigma is, is very big because it's very hard to go on a community and tell a person, uhm, my name is Justin Idleburg and, uhm, I have my own illness you know, but well usually meet somebody as not what you tell them. You know, uhm, but for coming say, of I'm live on campus somewhere stay one institution people are like what is that there, you know, where are you coming from? You know people are very ashamed to say you know, this is they facility they help us me gonna do treatment and I'll just to happen to live here. So it's just I have noticed human nature but it is some type of nature where people like back up like if they see a mouse or let me see the mouse the really back up real quickly. You know, ah, is, is hard for you to deal with something that you-- that your doctor and, uhm, your nurse practitioner have told no you're just as normal as everybody else you just have, ah, imbalance but the rest of the world does not see that. They see us as being, uhm, be a mentally retarded and they weren't able to do anything. Ah, what I like to do is to show the world that we are not. You know, we are much more than, uhm, a diagnosis you know, we are here with jobs, uhm, it has been many great man in the world history that has did things you never-- you never ever knew. You know, you have western church you know, Abraham Lincoln they both had a form of mental illness. Do they, uhm, does it worst you know, slap them on their wrist and put them in classes no they don't. They keep on applied those men for other great works and as a consumer I was that I not, not I wish not to getting on that list but I do want to be able to say that I'd made, made a dent in helping changing in people's mind on how they see us in the service that we are provided. 

00:34:20
THOM PANCELLA Can you follow that? 

00:34:20
BRYAN EVANS I think Justin is, ah, ah, a model in a appropriate model for African American, uhm, the African American community and, ah, not just the African American community but, ah, I'll speak from a personal place for African Americans in particularly, ah, people of color and men of color because there is such heavy stigma, stigma in regards to mental illness, ah, suicide, depression, bipolar illness and he has, ah, been very active in his care, ah, but also has a community of support when you Justin today you also see all the family members and friends who are behind him, ah, to help him get to the point where he is today. You see the work of his clinical, ah, treatment but more and more much more importantly in the net you see again those persons who were behind him. And, and the other part of stigma because, ah, particular in many, ah, communities when we start talk about communities it again, ah, we don't go seek out, you know. If you-- if your men you know, you, you just, you know, you just deal with it. Ah, go play some ball and work through it or you know, drink it out smoke it out, do whatever you have to do to get through it but whatever you do don't say that you had to go seek an clinician and you had to go see a psychiatrist or psychologist or a therapist because that meet that put in a whole different category. Ah, and I realizing that mental illness is not person, ah, he, ah, Justin is as well all the rest of this all of us in the family have someone or not ourselves who have to deal with a mental illness or a crisis in our life. Ah, how we chose to handle that oftentimes is based upon how we been educated. What we believe about seeking treatment. And stigma not only happens in terms of the person but the family members because family members can feel well if I had only did something, if I had only step in then maybe this one will happen, maybe this is my fault. maybe I cause this to happen. So they're also becomes a barrier when you say someone as well I have a friend or my child is going through something. Ah, my brother is, ah, my sister is how do I deal with that. We have to break the barriers of stigma and the only way that we can do that is be by coming becoming aware, by intervening and the other part of again is looking at models just like Justin. Ah, who becomes a our champion but there are many more champions out there who are telling their story, ah, and, and, and not being ashamed of it. And also saying, look at where I am in my own recover. Look at where I am today. 

00:37:10

JUSTIN IDLEBURG I think I'm, I'm the best I have been in a long you know.
