Why emotion is important and why we get stuck in them 

00:00:15
ROBERT COLLINS Why emotion is important and, uh… how we can get stuck or have problems with our emotions. So, human beings have emotions because they developed them or ancestors developed them over time because they helped our ancestors survive, um… and so over, uh… Millions of years of Animal Human Evolution, uh… We developed various kinds of emotions. Some of the earliest emotions developed was for example: fear, uh… and then things like love and compassion developed, um… More recently, in, in, in our past ,um… And so now, we have a full range of emotions and, um… so emotions are quite important to us but, uh… specifically emotions are important three ways. Uh… First emotions have, have information, emotions a point to important situations in our lives so, every different kind of emotion points to something important happening in the situation around us in our environment so, uh… if we're angry, it tells us that something, uh… some boundary of ours is being violated or could be our person, our children, our property, but something is infringing on that boundary and we angered tells us that, sadness tells us that we've lost something, we've lost a connection. Um… Loves tells us we were in the presence of a highly valued object, um… And so and umm… we, uh… so emotions point to important things in, in our lives and they have information for us. So that means, if that we, if we are not in touch with our emotions then we are losing valuable information, we are being cut off from our situations, and um… we will not be able to cope as well because we won't have um… The input that we need. uh… Emotions are also important, uh… because they give us a sense of continuity or direction in our life. So, uh… part of how I recognize who I am, and over time is by the quality of my emotions, uh… the quality of maybe the sadness I feel at, at, being slightly separate from other people I recognize that from my childhood, my adolescence, my adulthood, and so emotions are important because they give us a sense of continuity or hold us a sense of being a whole self, which is important for human beings, so we don't feel so fragmented, um… and the third way that emotions are important is that they connect to action. They help us to prepare us for action the word "emotion", basically means what puts us in move, in motion but what moves us forward, uh… and so, um… If we know what we're feeling then we can figure out what we need, what that emotion is, what need that emotions pointing to, what we need in our lives. What needs to happen because of the emotion and so the, motions point to needs or wants and if we know, we need or want, we can figure out how to get those needs or wants met. So, if we don't have access to the emotions. We don't know what we need and we can't figure out what to do and that means that people, uh… who have severely blocked their emotions or constrain them, or people who have suffered injuries to the part of their motions where they experience emotions, those people, uh… lose the ability to make choices in their lives and they feel lost and aimless. So emotions, uh… gives a sense of continuity, um… They give us information about their situation and they help move us to action, uh… Those are three ways in which emotions are important to us and, um… Are valuable and it's even an essential for us being human and navigating through our lives but people get stuck in their emotions, they have different kinds of difficulties with their emotions and, um… And, and they have three main kinds of difficulties. Uh… I believe with their emotions. The first of those difficulties is that the emotions can get out of whack they, you know, it's like your emotional thermostat gets set too high in which case your stiflingly hot, and you're overwhelm with the heat in your, in your house for example or the emotions can, uh… be turned down to low, so to the emotional thermostat can be turned way, way down and then you're kind of cut off. It's as if you're kind of emotionally frozen and you get cut off from your emotions, so motions can get out of whack either by being too low or turn down too much, so they're blocked in which case you don't have the information, you can't, you lose the, uh… sort of impulse to action in the sense of continuity I was talking about, uh…or the emotions can be too much they can feel overwhelming, we can feel like they're just in our face and that we're it's not that we're having the emotion, the emotion is having us. We're in the grip of a powerful fear or an overwhelming sadness and we just get stuck and can't get out and so, so sometimes the emotion is too much and we need to find a way of moderating or containing or pulling back from that that really strong or painful emotion. That's one way we get stuck in emotions, uh… we can also get stuck in our emotions. If we don't fully develop them, emotions connect all the experiences we have to our, our sense of the situation, uh… to our body, to our minds, and how we symbolize experiences to our actions, so motions tie all that together and if we don't fully elaborate emotions, they'll be pieces missing from them and we can get stuck because we're not able to get out all the information in all the different aspects the emotions, so another way. And, the third way we get stuck in our emotions is if we have one emotion that's fits the situation and then we do something to, we react against that emotion and we block it with another emotion. So, another emotion come basically comes in and sits on top of or interferes or stops the first emotion, for example if I have a quarrel with my partner, um… Over something, you know, about when dinner is going to be ready or who's doing what, um… Then I might feel anxious or frayed that she's gonna, it's gonna, the relationship is gonna go downhill, everything will fall apart and, um… so I might, students start feeling afraid or anxious, um… but, um… then instead of working with the fear, uh… and examining it and reflecting on it, uh… Seeing what it needs, uh… I might start, I might get angry, uh… Instead, I might get angry at the fear and that anger is going to come out either anger towards myself for being weak and afraid what might come out as anger at my partner for causing me to be afraid. And, so then I might go pick a fight with her. um… or I might get depressed and pull back into myself and, you know, if I've just had a fight with my partner me pulling back and pouting and being depressed or me picking a fight with her both of either of those things are gonna not help the situation at all in fact, they'll make it worse. So, we can get into trouble if we let another emotion come along and cover up the most important or useful emotion. So, we can get stuck in our emotions, you know, by, uh… not fully processing them, by letting them get too much or too little or by allowing another motion to come and basically shut down the main most, most useful emotion.
