00:01:00
EUGENE GENDLIN Uh, any two? You're already on your way, is that right? Okay. All right. So hello. Hello, hello. They're gonna chop us off at the end, so I'm eager to get started. I can't hear you. Okay. Uh, the most important thing I wanna tell you is focusing.org because you can find out everything there. So if you can remember the word focusing. Dot org simply goes for any non-profit organization. Focusing.org will get you an ant hill full of stuff, material. Huh? Yes. So if you will remember focusing.org, everything will be perfectly clear when you get there. Uh, to introduce focusing briefly is difficult. We're all familiar with, uh, feelings and emotions and, uh, this is a way to pay attention to the body from the inside, not the ordinary body the way you're used to, uh, where your belt is tight or where your neck hurts but the body from the inside which is a place that's a little bit hard to find. Some people have it already, some are close to it, some, uh, very far away from it. Uh, it starts with the ordinary body in the chair but then when you pay attention to it, there's a change there in time and there's a change. The space gets larger and the steps come there. There's a healing process that's there. It's a, it's a natural physical healing process but it, uh, makes little steps. Now I, it'd be nice if I could show you that but I can't promise that. I will work with whoever comes up here and, uh, I will probably at some point do something like focusing. So I want to alert you to that because this is the purpose here. We had a workshop on focusing yesterday. The purpose here is to show how focusing is integrated into psychotherapy. Now psychotherapy to me is that I use anything that I ever learned and I wanna learn some more. I'm interested in helping the person in front of me. I know that the most important thing in psychotherapy, to me, is for me to keep that person company and I'm working for that person and I know that with all the different things I've learned, if I keep that person company, if I can hear that person, if I can take in what that person is feeling and saying, it will happen. Now, probabl ndifferent process and it has a different set of steps. It's how the body has the whole thing, very much more finely, very much more intricately than our emotions and our feelings have. We get stuck with out emotions and feelings. This place is deeper, not far down but further down. If you meditate, you'll skip it and go all the way down. That's not where it is. It's on the way down but it's a physical feel of whatever you're talking about and if you just ask people what does it make here, some proportion of them, less than half, will immediately find that, even if you don't. The other two-thirds will say what did you say? And so then just go back to where they were and go on with them and invite them to do that again maybe a week later or so 'cuz they're not gonna find it just like that. It usually takes us two, three days to really show it to somebody. Okay. Uh, now to keep a person real company means that I put all my stuff over there. All the stuff that I know and all the different methods that I can hide behind, if I need to, I'll go hide but mostly I don't wanna hide. I put them all over there and my own junk also. It's over there and, you know, if I'm listening, I'm, I'm free. And then if something there upsets me, I go say oh yeah, that's got my taste on it. Yeah, I know. I'll deal with it later. Uh, sometimes it indicates something that's happening here, then I've got to do something about it. So you will see me sit down with a person and be a very large sort of presence. So I want you to know that when I'm the client, I don't look like that. Okay? Okay. I know something there. I know that the process only requires a person and I am a person and if the person working with me looks into my eyes, they'll notice a shaky person. That's me. Usually they don't look but if they look, they'll see that. That's gotta be okay. With that attitude, it becomes very easy and peaceful to keep someone company. I'm not asking to take over their life. I'm long past the idea that I've got to say something smart every minute. I, I say something and then I look carefully to see if it takes and if it doesn't, I say get it out of here. It's wrong. How does it go? And, uh, the whole process becomes relatively easy to do. And then there area whole lot of little skills that we add to that but that's enough introduction. So where's my person, my first person? Now they're gonna have to put mics on us and all that stuff. 

00:07:50
[sil.] 

00:07:50
EUGENE GENDLIN So can you all hear me? 

00:08:40
AUDIENCE No. 

00:08:40
EUGENE GENDLIN (inaudible[00:008:44]). Working. Now it's working. All right. You try it. 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN Am I on? 

00:08:50
AUDIENCE Yes. 

00:08:50
EUGENE GENDLIN Okay. Good. So hello. 

00:08:55
UNKNOWN Hi. How are you? 

00:08:55
EUGENE GENDLIN Not bad. 

00:08:55
UNKNOWN That's good. You're better than I am. 

00:09:00
EUGENE GENDLIN Not bad. Oh, I forgot to say, you don't have to say everything. You can keep, you heard me yesterday, I think. You were there. You, she just told me, I said do I know you. She said no but I was there yesterday. So that's good. So you heard me say that you don't have to say anything that would make you uncomfortable, especially in this place. So you can hear from your own inside very privately whatever and say whatever you like, part of it. So, so take a minute and calm down. Just breath. 

00:09:30
UNKNOWN Okay. I'm feeling very tight in my, across my shoulders. 

00:09:40
EUGENE GENDLIN You're feeling tight in... 

00:09:40
UNKNOWN Very tight and... 

00:09:45
EUGENE GENDLIN Tight in your shoulders. 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN Tenseness. 

00:09:45
EUGENE GENDLIN Ah. 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:09:45
EUGENE GENDLIN Tight and tense then. Does that belong with this situation. There's more. Ah, there's more. 

00:09:50
UNKNOWN It's associated with the sense I'm not under lights and in the spot, yes. 

00:09:55
EUGENE GENDLIN There's more. Okay. 

00:09:55
UNKNOWN Yes. When I'm in front of people or making a presentation to colleagues or people, um, not students, I... 

00:10:10
EUGENE GENDLIN I see. 

00:10:10
UNKNOWN Have a little anxiety. 

00:10:10
EUGENE GENDLIN Okay. So you took a big step of practice here? 

00:10:15
UNKNOWN Very big. 

00:10:15
EUGENE GENDLIN Congratulations. 

00:10:20
UNKNOWN Thank you. Big step. 

00:10:20
EUGENE GENDLIN That's real nice. Good. 

00:10:25
UNKNOWN And right now, it feels like there's something right, right here. 

00:10:35
EUGENE GENDLIN You feel it here? So you see, I don't have much work to do. 

00:10:35
UNKNOWN Hard ball. 

00:10:35
EUGENE GENDLIN So be gentle with it. You, you want it to do that so there it is now and we get to hear from it if, if it'll talk to you but it's there, hmm? 

00:10:50
UNKNOWN Yes. Very much so. 

00:10:55
EUGENE GENDLIN So now I wanna say be pleased that it's there 'cuz you wanted to work on it. 

00:11:00
UNKNOWN I'd like to take care of it, some way. 

00:11:05
EUGENE GENDLIN To take care of it? What did you say all morning, I didn't hear you? 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN I'm sorry? 

00:11:10
EUGENE GENDLIN You said to take care of it. 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN I wanna take care of that... 

00:11:10
EUGENE GENDLIN You want to take care of it? 

00:11:15
UNKNOWN I would like to take care of it so that it's not a barrier in my way. 

00:11:20
EUGENE GENDLIN Yes. Yes. Yes. 

00:11:20
UNKNOWN It's like a boulder. 

00:11:20
EUGENE GENDLIN So you the person wants that barrier out of the way. You would like it to resolve or something so it isn't in your way. 

00:11:30
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:11:30
EUGENE GENDLIN And I would like you to be nice to it, even though you want it gone of course. To be nice to it like it's some part of you, but has to tell us why it's there. It knows why it's there. You can speculate but it would, so can you be nice to it even though you're mad at it over in some other department? 

00:11:50
UNKNOWN Okay, yeah. I'll try. 

00:11:55
EUGENE GENDLIN Good. 

00:11:55
UNKNOWN Uh. 

00:11:55
EUGENE GENDLIN That's good. 

00:11:55
UNKNOWN It's causing me to be shaky. 

00:12:00
EUGENE GENDLIN Yes. It's not that simple. That's all. 

00:12:00
UNKNOWN No. 

00:12:00
EUGENE GENDLIN It's not that simple. But inside if you could treat it like a wounded part of you or like a scared part of you and then we'll hear from it. Maybe it isn't wounded or scared, it's some other thing but treat it like a, like a wounded bunny or something like that that you can be mad at whoever wounded it but you're not mad at the bunny. 

00:12:20
UNKNOWN Well, right now, I'm, um, I'm petting it. 

00:12:25
EUGENE GENDLIN Oh good. 

00:12:25
UNKNOWN And I'm, I'm stroking it. 

00:12:30
EUGENE GENDLIN Yeah. Okay. Thank you. 

00:12:30
UNKNOWN That is feeling better. 

00:12:35
EUGENE GENDLIN Mm-hmm. 

00:12:35
UNKNOWN And I need to, to touch it and hold it. 

00:12:40
EUGENE GENDLIN Yes, you need to touch it and hold it. After a while, it'll, it'll tell us things. For the moment, this is just right. Needs to be touched and held. 

00:12:55
UNKNOWN And it seems to becoming softer. It's not as hard. 

00:13:00
 (crosstalk) It's becoming softer. 

00:13:00
UNKNOWN Like a fist. It's... 

00:13:05
EUGENE GENDLIN It's loosening a little, is that right? 

00:13:05
UNKNOWN It is, yes. 

00:13:05
EUGENE GENDLIN It's more, it's like a fist still? 

00:13:10
UNKNOWN No, it's not as tight. 

00:13:10
EUGENE GENDLIN (crosstalk) I couldn't hear you. It's loosening. 

00:13:10
UNKNOWN But it does need to be stroked and touched. 

00:13:20
EUGENE GENDLIN Stroked and cuddled you say? Sounds good. 

00:13:25
UNKNOWN Feels good too. 

00:13:30
EUGENE GENDLIN Stroked and cuddled. And be there and do that. There's no rush. 

00:13:40
UNKNOWN I'm not nearly as shaky. It was, it was shaking like this. 

00:13:50
EUGENE GENDLIN It was shaking and now it's not so shaky. 

00:13:50
UNKNOWN It's not quivering. 

00:13:50
EUGENE GENDLIN Not quivering now. 

00:13:50
UNKNOWN Anymore. 

00:13:50
EUGENE GENDLIN It's not quivering. So that was really right what we did. 

00:14:00
UNKNOWN My shoulders are not as tense right now. 

00:14:05
EUGENE GENDLIN Shoulders are not so tense. Oh, that's beautiful. So really perhaps what we should be sure of is that you know how we came, 'cuz this is already except stay and hold it and cuddle it. 

00:14:25
[sil.] 

00:14:25
EUGENE GENDLIN It's real good. It's not a whole, time is long down there. You stay a long time and hold it a long time. Cuddle it a long time. Not only three minutes. Up here. 

00:14:45
[sil.] 

00:14:45
UNKNOWN I see a softness from your eyes also that has helped... 

00:15:00
EUGENE GENDLIN Ah, yeah. Yes. Just right. 

00:15:05
UNKNOWN To make it feel better. 

00:15:05
EUGENE GENDLIN Right. It's true. 

00:15:10
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:15:15
[sil.] 

00:15:15
EUGENE GENDLIN And can you promise it that you'll come back and do that some more? 

00:15:25
UNKNOWN I'm definitely gonna come back and do that some more. Thank you so much. 

00:15:30
EUGENE GENDLIN (crosstalk) Yeah? Does that work? Are you willing to do it? 

00:15:35
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Yes it did. 

00:15:35
EUGENE GENDLIN Okay. 

00:15:35
UNKNOWN Yes it did. 

00:15:35
EUGENE GENDLIN Okay. 

00:15:35
UNKNOWN Wow. That was very powerful. It's very powerful. Thank you. 

00:15:40
EUGENE GENDLIN So probably that's all it wants for the moment. Is that right? 

00:15:45
UNKNOWN That's... 

00:15:45
EUGENE GENDLIN Check it. I mean, you might want, but it really, is that right? It's really saying this is okay. 

00:15:55
UNKNOWN It definitely is saying that it's okay. I do not feel like I did when I walked up these stairs. 

00:16:00
EUGENE GENDLIN (crosstalk) That's, well that's great. That's great. 

00:16:00
UNKNOWN Thank you very much. 

00:16:00
EUGENE GENDLIN (crosstalk) That's great. Thank you for coming up. 

00:16:05
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:16:05
EUGENE GENDLIN First one, that's real brave. Absolutely. Yes. 

00:16:15
UNKNOWN Thank you very much. 

00:16:15
EUGENE GENDLIN Yes. 

00:16:15
UNKNOWN Appreciate it. 

00:16:15
EUGENE GENDLIN Yes. 

00:16:15
UNKNOWN So much. 

00:16:20
EUGENE GENDLIN So will you all get up and stretch so we have a distinction between working in somebody's soul and, uh, discussing things? And will someone turn the lights on so that we can talk a little bit? You can't hear? Oh. Oh, all right. Could you hear most of what was going on? Okay. Good. I can use this for, for standing and talking. So have a seat. Thank you. It's just, it's a good demarcation 'cuz we sit too much anyhow. So I want to tell you real quickly that, uh, the people that I see during the week, this stuff doesn't work that fast. People who come to these conferences are, uh, have already done a lot of work inside themselves and so everything is very fast. So I didn't even have to say oh your neck is tight but what is here? She just could feel it there and I turned and said I don't have any work ot do. Remember? And the same is true with how easily she took this, this instruction of oh sure, you're angry at this thing. It's in your way. You want it out of the way. It's a barrier and all that but be nice to it. It's a wounded bunny so immediately could do that. I can work three months with somebody to get that. So it's lovely for me in demonstrating to show you these things, provided you don't get the illusion here that I'm some sort of magician. I'm not. Uh, you, if you understand it, then you can, with some patients, work for a long time to get your client to have that sort of attitude. It's not the thing you talk about of accepting yourself. That's not what it is. It's like I'm, I have these things wrong with me and I'm furious about those and you tell me to accept them and I'll kill you, you know? But if there's gonna be any change with them, I have to come downstairs in this kindly way and I have to say oh yeah. There's a wounded part there, you know. Then I get furious and say okay fine, you're furious but if we're gonna hear from this place, we have to be nice to it, you know? There's a distinction between the, the, the, the, the wounded bunny or the overloaded horse or the, the thing down there that is the reason why it's like this and, and how angry I am about what happened in my life about it. Well sure, I got both. So it's not a matter of accepting. It's not a matter of being a kind person. It's, you're not gonna hear from it unless you're willing to take this attitude towards it. Does that makes sense? Okay. So now I'd be glad to hear maybe three questions about what I did. Anything that you saw that was strange. You wouldn't have done it or something else like that and then I'll take my second person. Somebody say something. Okay here's somebody right in front. 

00:19:25
[sil.] 

00:19:25
EUGENE GENDLIN Ah. Oh, I see what you mean. No, I regularly would like it if the person I'm working with would pay attention right here, which means in the belly, abdomen area. That's where everything works the fastest and the easiest but some people can't get there so they feel it here. So, well, so I respond to the chest and then I say what do you feel in your belly about your chest? Or they have an ache over here in the shoulder and I say well what in your belly responds to your shoulder, you know? But it might take a lot of work to get them in here. But once they're in the belly, I say well, is it nice and comfortable there? Oh yeah. Okay. If you're really there, what does your belly feel about your shoulder. Something happens there. That's how I like to work and then there are those exceptions where it does not, it doesn't do that. It stays in the shoulder and those are typically what you're talking about. It has something to do with injuring my shoulder when I was 12 or something like that. That exists. Yes. Yes, yes. The first question was aren't there people who have certain things located in certain parts of their body, like in the shoulder let's say. Well, typically, the shoulders are burdened by the situation and if you come in the stomach, uh, you hear better about what's wrong and that moves and then the shoulder eases but there are people, I said to her, who had their shoulder damaged or beaten up or something like that and then it doesn't move and you have to work with the shoulder. So then she said yes, but what about a lump in the throat? So I realized no, she's right. That's also what I, what I first meant. Get people to come in their middle of their body and typically better down here but if it's something in here that wants to cry that's a knot in the throat, well, maybe we have to hear from it there. So I gave her a split level answer. I prefer it here so I try for that first but then if it's really here, well, so then we work with it here. Yes? Do I work on physical problems? You still have the what from it? Ah, yeah. 

00:22:15
[sil.] 

00:22:15
EUGENE GENDLIN I think there is a healing process in the body which is more holistic than whether it was this injury or that thing and it does help to get to a healing sense. It helps to, to get to a place where it's not just a theory, where you can feel yourself going out of the whatever it is you want to call it, the earth, the universe, the whatever and there's a healing there and there's a breath that it can give you there and that, that I know helps but that's not really answering your question. I don't know the answer to the question. It works on physical things. That's for sure and it helps the immune system according to our latest research and it probably helps healing. Now whether it will help what's left of your injury, I, that I don't know. It, one more. Yeah. 

00:23:10
[sil.] 

00:23:10
EUGENE GENDLIN Yes. Yes. It's very hard for me to work on my own problems. Other people's problems don't feel so difficult to me. So, so when somebody says, you know, I feel all tense, well, you've got I don't know how many thousand people sitting, of course you're tense. You know, so I kind of said to her is that why and she gave me the sign that's, that no, no, that's not the point and then said this thing is always there when I'm talking to anybody but, but students and I want it out of the way, right? So then I said oh yeah. So everything a person says, if I understand it, gives me the sense of oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I'm with you. Oh yeah. And so then it was clear that she could feel it but she felt it here so that was nice for me but then she looked pained and I could tell as of course is human normal that yeah, she could feel it but she didn't like that she could feel it. So I said well, you did want to work on it, so be glad it's here, you know? That didn't work so then I said, uh, well, uh, uh, let's welcome it because now we can work on it. So that didn't work. So then I said well, but we have to treat it with some kindliness or we're not gonna hear from it. It knows why it's, why it comes and you only think about it. I mean you've got all this past record and everything but it's still coming so it knows why it comes and, and we don't so, uh, treat it nicely. You know, treat it like a wounded bunny and that worked. But meanwhile, my sense of being with her is, is that when she finally said, uh, the warmth out of your eyes is helping me, I thought yeah, you're right. That's probably there. Makes sense. So am I answering the question? I, uh, I don't do exactly that. I learned way back with, with some method where you were supposed to watch whether the person's eyes moved to the left or the right or up or down or something but it totally lost me the person. So I don't, I don't do that but I know that, without any specific consciousness, I am very aware of her totally there. I'm sort of watching her so I know I take in her body and when it goes like that, I can, I, I feel it and when the voice breaks, I, I hear it and so yes, and the same with the, with the breathing. I, I mean I know that I see all that but I don't look for it separately. It's more the feel of, the feel of the person there but I watch the person. That's the most thing, the biggest thing I do, is I'm over there watching. So yes, I think the answer would be yes. Okay, where's my second person? Oh, somebody was ready? 

00:26:30
[sil.] 

00:26:30
EUGENE GENDLIN Well, if it falls, it falls. 

00:27:40
UNKNOWN Hello? Is that work? 

00:27:40
EUGENE GENDLIN I think so. 

00:27:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:27:40
EUGENE GENDLIN Say a little more. Testing one, two, three. 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN Hello? Hello? 

00:27:45
EUGENE GENDLIN Can you hear her? 

00:27:45
UNKNOWN Can you hear me? 

00:27:45
EUGENE GENDLIN Go to, louder? Turn up the mic. No, it's not for us to be louder. They can turn it up. 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN Is that better? 

00:27:55
EUGENE GENDLIN Sounds like it. 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:27:55
EUGENE GENDLIN So hello. 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN Hello. 

00:28:00
EUGENE GENDLIN Hello. Take your time and let all the tension go, if that's possible. Start anywhere you like. 

00:28:15
UNKNOWN I'm real excited to be doing this with you. 

00:28:20
EUGENE GENDLIN I may have to come closer because I have to (inaudible ). I hear you but I don't hear what you said. Say it again. 

00:28:25
UNKNOWN I said I'm real excited to be doing this with you. 

00:28:25
EUGENE GENDLIN Oh. Okay. All right. So there's excitement there. 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:28:30
EUGENE GENDLIN Oh. 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN Uh, I had a trauma recently that I've been avoiding and, uh, just the last couple weeks, I decided I should not avoid. 

00:28:40
EUGENE GENDLIN Ah. 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN You know. 

00:28:40
EUGENE GENDLIN So there is a trauma that you're working on and that's one thing you wanna be doing now? Yeah. 

00:28:55
[sil.] 

00:28:55
EUGENE GENDLIN So I feel like looking away so that you can be with yourself 'cuz I see you coming out (inaudible ). See now she's putting her hand here. So she's already going to go look there. 

00:29:30
UNKNOWN I feel like I need to tell you, maybe I don't but, uh... 

00:29:35
EUGENE GENDLIN Oh yes. Feel free to say anything. I'm just making sure you don't feel pressured to say things. Oh no, you're welcome, yeah. Anything. 

00:29:40
UNKNOWN Uh, I recently had a, a cancer operation. I, I had a hysterectomy. 

00:29:45
EUGENE GENDLIN Ah. 

00:29:45
UNKNOWN So I'm going through that kind of loss. 

00:29:50
EUGENE GENDLIN That's, yeah, right. 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN My ovaries and I'm, the hot flashes are... 

00:29:55
EUGENE GENDLIN So there's a loss there and also stuff comes. 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Those kinds of things. So. 

00:30:05
[sil.] 

00:30:05
UNKNOWN So that was a bitter breath already. 

00:30:10
EUGENE GENDLIN Was that yours or mine? 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN Mine. Yours too. 

00:30:15
EUGENE GENDLIN It's a bitter breath that came in you, not just in me. 

00:30:20
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:30:25
[sil.] 

00:30:25
UNKNOWN So should I just wait for you to... 

00:31:00
EUGENE GENDLIN (crosstalk) If you're asking me, what I would say is come down here and see if that's possible. Can you be in there? If that's not hard for you and then let that guide us. Let it sort itself out. What would it like to do? There's probably two or things together. Let it sort out, itself out. What's there now? 

00:31:15
UNKNOWN It's sort of screaming. 

00:31:20
EUGENE GENDLIN Something is screaming. 

00:31:25
[sil.] 

00:31:25
UNKNOWN I have this sense of, of different, uh, like, organs but they're kind of like balls and kind of... 

00:31:40
EUGENE GENDLIN It feels like they're different organs in there and some of them are screaming? 

00:31:45
UNKNOWN Like don't know where to be. 

00:31:45
EUGENE GENDLIN Like they, somebody who, they don't know where to be. Where do I be? Is that right? Somebody's saying where do I be. Where can I be? Is that right? 

00:32:00
[sil.] 

00:32:00
UNKNOWN Well, I'm telling them they're gonna be okay. 

00:32:05
EUGENE GENDLIN Okay. You're telling them they're gonna be okay and that, that helps but let's wait and see where it says that you can be or somebody can be. Was it your or was it, what did it feel like? Somebody said where can I be, where can I be, where can I sit down? Where can I, where can I make, like that? Where can I make a home or base or, that's how I protect (inaudible[00:32:34). 

00:32:30
UNKNOWN It sort of started with a sense like they were just sort of in space but... 

00:32:35
EUGENE GENDLIN They were just in space and they needed to land somewhere, be somewhere. 

00:32:40
UNKNOWN And then now I visualize sort of they're in a home, I guess. They're not screaming anymore. 

00:32:50
EUGENE GENDLIN They're not screaming anymore. Okay. 

00:32:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:32:55
EUGENE GENDLIN And they like the idea of a home. Is that what happened there? 

00:32:55
UNKNOWN I think so. 

00:33:00
EUGENE GENDLIN Out of all the stuff I said, that one word, it took one word out of it and did something with it. 

00:33:10
[sil.] 

00:33:10
EUGENE GENDLIN Just freshly look and see what's there. Sort of, doesn't have to be exactly how we said. Whatever's there. 

00:33:25
[sil.] 

00:33:25
UNKNOWN It just feels a lot more peaceful. 

00:33:25
EUGENE GENDLIN Something became a lot more peaceful. 

00:33:55
UNKNOWN Well, now they're saying they still don't know where they belong. 

00:34:00
EUGENE GENDLIN They still don't know where they belong. 

00:34:00
UNKNOWN I'm always in a hurry to fix things, I think. 

00:34:05
EUGENE GENDLIN Yeah, no, that's, that fits. Yeah. That makes perfect sense. Some, it, it did become more peaceful but now they still say where do we belong and just stay with them because we don't have to figure the answer out upstairs. Just stay there and so oh, you don't know where you belong? Uh-huh. You wanna know where you belong. Just wait a minute. Something comes there. They don't know where they belong. 

00:34:35
[sil.] 

00:34:35
EUGENE GENDLIN And just appreciate that, in itself, kind of you're hearing from them and so, I, I would like you to be glad that you can hear from them. Oh, they want to belong and they don't know where to belong. That's where it's at right now. 

00:35:05
UNKNOWN I think they're glad I'm finally paying attention. 

00:35:10
EUGENE GENDLIN Yeah. Good. See how happy I get when she says that? That you're, you're, you're sensing from down there that it's glad you're playing attention and that's already a step. Does something want to cry or is something else? 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN I'm sorry? 

00:35:25
EUGENE GENDLIN I just want to make sure you're free to cry but... 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Oh. Yeah. 

00:35:30
EUGENE GENDLIN If that comes. They're glad you're paying attention. 

00:35:35
[sil.] 

00:35:35
EUGENE GENDLIN You know, we can be okay here for a while. Yes? 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Right. 

00:35:50
EUGENE GENDLIN Yes? Yeah, get the smile from her. Yeah, acknowledgment. That's okay. 

00:36:00
[sil.] 

00:36:00
EUGENE GENDLIN Still there? Yes. Good. 

00:36:20
UNKNOWN They're teasing me about my hot flashes. 

00:36:25
EUGENE GENDLIN They're doing what about it? 

00:36:25
UNKNOWN Teasing me. 

00:36:25
EUGENE GENDLIN They're teasing you about your hot flases. 

00:36:35
[sil.] 

00:36:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, something good can finally happen. I'm warm once in a while. 

00:36:35
EUGENE GENDLIN Something good can finally happen, you're... 

00:36:45
UNKNOWN Oh, I'm warm once in a while when I have hot flashes. 

00:36:50
EUGENE GENDLIN Ah, yeah. So they're saying something lighthearted about them. Well, at least they keep you warm a little bit now and then but this in sense that those are not so serious or so scary or something. Did I get that right? No, not exactly. 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) That they're, that they're not, I'm sorry. Couldn't hear you. 

00:37:20
EUGENE GENDLIN That there's something okay about their saying well at least those hot flashes keep you warm or something, so there's some lightness came. And they're still waiting to find out where they belong are they? 

00:37:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. They're a bit angry at me for doing this. 

00:37:45
EUGENE GENDLIN Oh, they're angry at you for doing this. Which is this? 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN I guess cutting them up. 

00:37:50
EUGENE GENDLIN Oh, oh. So be gentle. Be gentle. You didn't ave a choice probably about it very much. But just stay and be understanding. Oh, they're angry you think at this moment but we'll hear more. They might be angry that you cut them up and now they don't know where they belong. Something like that? Be very gentle with them. Oh, of course that might be, that might be. Can we just say back are you angry because I cut you up? Is that what that is? 

00:38:35
[sil.] 

00:38:35
EUGENE GENDLIN So be ready to understand that with some warmth of your own rather than feeling condemned or some, something like that. 

00:38:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. It switched to just, uh, a general anger now. Yeah. 

00:38:55
EUGENE GENDLIN Just anger here. So we'll let anger through, right? Anger is good for us if it moves forward. So let it through. You're angry that all that stuff had to happen. Is that right? What's the right way to say that? There is anger here. 

00:39:20
[sil.] 

00:39:20
EUGENE GENDLIN Is it okay with you that you're angry? 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, it's all, it's much better now. 

00:39:30
EUGENE GENDLIN Oh, okay. Okay. 

00:39:30
UNKNOWN To see it's more expression. 

00:39:35
EUGENE GENDLIN Amen. 

00:39:35
UNKNOWN Got me a little dizzy. 

00:39:40
EUGENE GENDLIN Take it easy. That's fine. 

00:39:45
UNKNOWN But it feels good. I'm not sure why it was so threatening that I just wouldn't, I wouldn't do this exercise for a couple months. I wouldn't let myself do that. 

00:40:05
EUGENE GENDLIN You don't know why but you weren't able or willing or something to come down like to it like that. Is that what you're... 

00:40:10
UNKNOWN (crosstalk) Right, right. 

00:40:10
EUGENE GENDLIN Oh, okay. That's, well. 

00:40:15
[sil.] 

00:40:15
EUGENE GENDLIN Stay a minute and then we can stop. Just, it's good there. 

00:40:30
[sil.] 

00:40:30
EUGENE GENDLIN You don't need to say another thing unless you want to but just take a minute of peace down there. 

00:40:40
UNKNOWN Well, now I'm feeling selfish. Uh, I hope, I hope somebody learns something from this because I'm certainly getting a lot out of it. So. Yeah. 

00:40:55
EUGENE GENDLIN Well that's good. 

00:41:00
[sil.] 

00:41:00
EUGENE GENDLIN And it's also good to be selfish sometimes. 

00:41:15
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:41:15
EUGENE GENDLIN Be nice if you could just be selfish. 

00:41:25
[sil.] 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN Feels good. 

00:41:25
EUGENE GENDLIN Good. 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN I mean, peaceful. 

00:41:25
EUGENE GENDLIN That's great. Okay, so just check. Is the right place to stop? It probably is. 

00:41:45
UNKNOWN Feels like a good place to stop. 

00:41:50
EUGENE GENDLIN (crosstalk) Okay. Good. Okay? 

00:41:50
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:41:50
EUGENE GENDLIN Yeah, thank you. 

00:41:55
[sil.] 

00:41:55
EUGENE GENDLIN Yes? 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN Yeah, good. 

00:41:55
EUGENE GENDLIN Yes, yes. 

00:42:05
[sil.] 

00:42:05
EUGENE GENDLIN I'm always glad to hug somebody but I just do the sort of and then if they want it, oh yeah. Then okay. I don't push hugs on people. Um, well, again, people who come to a conference like this have done a lot of work and so it doesn't take very long. So my work consisted in making that good space there and so it was lovely for me to be able to show you that. It's a kind of oh yeah. Can you sympathize with that? Because I know what happens the other way. It's like oh, you get all upset about you had no choice but you did this and, no, something is speaking. Be glad it's speaking. Can you be glad it's speaking? No. And then she went to saying oh, sure. It was glad she came and at that point oh, now we're all right. You know, so then I relaxed. Good. I'd like to hear, well, would you stand up and sit down. I forgot my ritual. And now you can sit down again. Say again? There'd be lovely to have a mic. Where's the mic? The mic is in the middle row where it usually is so come up and ask a question or make a comment or anything like that. I wanna say again, be connected with us, uh, the focusing organization is, is big. It's all over the world. It's got all kinds of materials. Uh, one important thing to say about focusing is please don't think that anybody wants you to do only focusing. Focusing combines very well with everything else that ever helped anybody. Uh, it will make whatever you already do better. It's my new slogan. Don't do focusing by itself. Mic's not on. Turn our mic on please. 

00:44:10
UNKNOWN Oh there we go. That was, uh, kind of my other question. Uh, where would you go, for example, in subsequent sessions now that you've, uh, processed where it was and such and... 

00:44:20
EUGENE GENDLIN Well, you see, for some reason, I lucked into two people who could do actually focusing right away but that wouldn't be typical. Uh, when a client first comes, they're very often very far away from that but it varies a lot. Uh, borderline people and adolescents who are so difficult to work with, they get focusing right away. You can start there. But many other people take a long time. So in a, in a normal therapy, it isn't likely that that would happen in the first 15 minutes. Does that answer it a little? 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN Uh, kind of but what was the, what would be the next step after they've had some, like, acceptance? Do you keep checking in with them? 

00:45:00
EUGENE GENDLIN Oh yes. Yes. Once you know where that is, you keep checking in there and not to do anything, but just sort of hello? Am I okay? And typically, you know, if I check in way down there and say well, how am I now? Oh, okay. All right. So what's there. Oh yeah, of course this. All right. That. Yeah right. Well, is that it? You know? And it feels better right away. You know? Or this and that. Yeah, okay. But is that all? All right. Well, what's? Oh yeah, that. Okay. All right. So what I do all the time is what I just demonstrated I check in and I see that there's things between me and feeling, uh, good or at ease or wonderful and I sort of, I let them tell me what they are and then right away, I feel better. Now of course that doesn't mean I make big progress on those things. All I'm doing is finding myself under them and feeling, feeling better. And then once in a while, when I have to, I work on something, right? So, so that too, during certain periods, I, I have to do a lot of work on them. Yes, and I asked her that. I said, you know, just make sure, can you come back here? Will you come back? They're glad they have your attention. Will you come again? And she said oh yes. And I could tell she would. But, uh, then there are more steps. Typically you check and something that's a problem, it doesn't go away in, in, in, in five minutes. It makes a little step and then another little step and then another little step and another little step. So chances are, later today when she checks in, it's gonna say and she's gonna say what is that? Ah. And it'll be some other thing that they want or that they have to say. Does that make sense? 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:47:00
EUGENE GENDLIN Thank you. That was a helpful question. 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:47:05
EUGENE GENDLIN Another question? Where's my time person? Well, I let him (inaudible ). 

00:47:13
UNKNOWN What are your thought, what is your thought process in between the patient's verbalizations? 

00:47:15
EUGENE GENDLIN What is my thought process when? 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN In between the patient's verbalizations? 

00:47:20
EUGENE GENDLIN Oh, I see. Well, that's also a nice question. Up here, for me, every god damned thing goes by. You know, you know. I, but what I am doing is I don't pay much attention to what goes by. I am sensing whether we're connected, whether we're all right, whether, and there's a certain smoothness when we're connected which you saw, because I lucked into these two people. There's a certain ease and then when that's interrupted because I've misunderstood something or said something wrong or something new came, then it's sort of like, uh, so then I have to say what was that or what I said wasn't right was it or something like that until it's restored again. So my, my focus is there, on the person and are we connected and to me, that comes first. So if I'm teaching focusing and a person decides to get tight, I have to know what is that. Well, the focusing isn't welcome now. Okay, the hell with it. Out with it. Where are you? All right. The relationship is more important than anything else. So that's where my thought process is really but up here, everything comes by. Ridiculous ideas and diagnostic concepts and philosophical thoughts. Uh, you know, I've probably been working on, on philosophical text in the morning and that comes by and, and, you know, somebody thinks it's an awful shame that I don't have a chance to write those things down but that's too bad. Uh, stupid, insulting, irreverent things. All kinds of stuff. I don't mind. They're free up there. The constitution says they can think anything they want. It's something like if you're looking for a dime in your pocket, sort of. You know, you, you, it's hard to concentrate on the two fingers feeling through all these different things 'cuz you have all these thoughts but you keep coming back to your hand. You keep coming back and keep coming back until you've sorted through everything in your pocket. Yes? Somebody here stirred? No? Okay. Someone there? 

00:49:30
UNKNOWN I'm thinking in the context of eastern medicine, that there's more than one energy center in the body and I'm wondering what you think it is about this energy center around the solar plexus. 

00:49:40
EUGENE GENDLIN Now wait. Let me repeat it and I only heard it up to there. From an eastern point of view you said, there is more than one answer, more than one center? 

00:49:50
UNKNOWN More than one energy center, uh, in eastern medicine. 

00:49:50
EUGENE GENDLIN (crosstalk) Center, yeah. Chakras you mean? 

00:49:55
UNKNOWN Yes and... 

00:49:55
EUGENE GENDLIN Yes. 

00:49:55
UNKNOWN And I'm wondering what you think it is about the, this energy center that makes it so, um, easy to work with a lot of problems from this center. 

00:50:00
EUGENE GENDLIN Well, I don't know. No, I really don't. I don't. I, I have correlated sort of over the years with the chakra thing and I'm, I'm impressed with the similarity. It's like in one tradition they have five chakras and the other tradition, they have seven, which lets you know that it isn't that definite. Well, that's my experience too. You know? Is it the stomach? Well, maybe it's the abdomen. So, so it's similar. Uh, what I do see is that both I and they find, uh, find it over again, that the characteristics are different from the different ones and I think you said that also there. That here, this is indeed the heart center. This is a place that can fight back when it's strong and gets wounded when it, and it, it's much slower here. Uh, but it's very important when it's here but it's much slower. So when something is here, the first thing I say is how does your stomach feel about that? Works faster. Basically the answer is I don't know. Yes? One minute, one more question. 

00:51:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. My question is, I was aware, more especially in the second, um, the second person that you worked with that your breathing was mimicking hers and, or vice versa and, um, I use breathing a lot and I was wondering, and oftentimes I'll consciously tell them, I want you to breath into your body. 

00:51:25
EUGENE GENDLIN Uh-huh. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN But I was noticing that you were doing that same process without even saying anything about it. 

00:51:35
EUGENE GENDLIN Well. 

00:51:35
UNKNOWN And are you consciously doing that? 

00:51:35
EUGENE GENDLIN Yes. For me, uh, it's typical when you get a step in focusing, when something here speaks and you hear it and it's right, there's typically an involuntary breath that comes. Ha. And I am so used to that big difference that something involuntary breathes like that that I don't deliberately do any breathing. Now once in a while when I'm very anxious, I remember, oh yeah, breathe through your belly. Yeah, that'll help. Okay. But, but most of the time, no. It's, uh, it, it comes before I'm aware that it came and there was this funny moment when I heard my own breath. I didn't know that was gonna come there and my own breath that I heard was so loud that I couldn't be sure that she had one. So I said to her, you know, you mean yours? No, she said, her breath. So no, I don't do that. I let them come but I sure hear them when they come because they indicate to me that ah, now we're okay somewhat. 

00:52:35
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:52:35
EUGENE GENDLIN (crosstalk) So let, let the involuntary come and if you know something about breathing, I'm not against it. Okay. Thank you very much.
