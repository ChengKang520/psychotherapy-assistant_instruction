Unfinished business/ unresolved grief 

00:00:15
ROBERT ELLIOT So the under main task in depression is unfinished business, uh… and we use empty share process for that, um… and here the person, uh… is stuck in, umm… an older relationship, uh… which has ended because the person died as unresolved grief or because the other person has left the relation, the relationship is broken up and the client continues to dwell on this relationship, um… and this, they, there… there… there's still hooked into it and often this, um… unresolved relationship means the person, the client cannot be open to new relationships. They kind of close themselves down, uh… still holding out for this, other relation, the person might have died 20 years ago but something in the client are the person is still holding out forgetting, uh… something resolved with, with the other person that they're grieving or mourning for or resenting in some way and so, um… the client comes in there, they're blaming and complaining about the other person, if only my father had listened to if, only my mother had supported me, only, uh… my old boss had, um… seen how good I was, if only ex- partner had been more understanding and so the person is stuck or locked in these old bad feelings, but actually what's driving the unfinished business is one or more un met needs, so the client needed something from this person, they need validation, they need support, there's some important need in their life that they needed from this other person and they didn't get it. They didn't get it because the person died, the relationship ended, they got into fight with each other and, um… drifted apart and so there's still the unmet deed and the unmet need keeps the unfinished business alive. It's like part of the person is still looking for that… that need to be met. That need for support, love, protection, whatever it was, they're still looking for it and they get stuck, um… in this hanging on refusing to let go of the unmet need and basically an eft, they way we help our clients with that is we help the clients to go through that an emotional deepening process with the go from the secondary reactive blaming, complaining about the other to accessing, uh… more deep anger and sadness about what happened between them and the other person, sadness about the they've missed, anger about, um… how they were mistreated by the person, um… and um… we helped them to fully express the anger in the sadness and as almost always anger and sadness, um… and we help them to access the core pain, the pain that's, you know, what's the worse part about what happened with you and your ex- partner or with you and your dad. What's the part that hurts the most, we help the client access that, that's what's, you know, they're doing, uh… 'cause they keep circling round in the more secondary emotions and we helped them access that and then, um… we have them see whether, it would ever be possible for that other person to beat that unmet need and the answer is almost no, 'cause that have other persons gone, they're dead, um… and yet the unmet need is important develop mentally and within often go into a self soothing process, we help the client to meet that need themselves or too find other relationships, in other words letting go the unmet need from the, the person that was originally connected with and finding other people to meet it or to meet it ourselves through self soothing process. So that's the other key process in depression which we find in the context of unresolved grief or a broken relationships, um… that people get stuck in
