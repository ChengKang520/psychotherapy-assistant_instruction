DR. SHANNON DERMER Welcome to Therapy Talks: Powerful Ideas for Modern Practitioners. I'm Dr. Shannon Dermer from Governors State University, and I'm hosting this series of innovative talks presented by Alexander Street Press. We will focus on important topics in counseling for the trainee, professional, and educator. Experts in the field of counseling will offer solutions to some of the most challenging issues moderns practitioners face. Today, we have the honor of Kim Olver joining us. She is the best-selling, award-winning author of Secrets of Happy Couples, co-authors of Leveraging Diversity at Work, and creator of Inside Out Empowerment, and Executive Director of William Glasser International. Kim is an internationally recognized speaker and coach who helps people get along better with the important people in their lives, including themselves; themselves at home and at work. She will be speaking to you on the topic of counseling military members and families in her therapy talk: The Emotional Cycle of Deployment. And today, before we have Kim do her talk, I'd like to ask her a question, and that's: how did you get involved in counseling families of the military?

00:01:35
KIM OLVER Well, it actually started when my baby boy, who was 17 years, 51 weeks old, came to me and says, 'mom, will you sign me up for the Army? I want to go fight in Iraq.' And it was one of the hardest things I ever had to do, was to actually go with him to the recruiter's office and sign my name to this piece of paper that I knew was going to send him off to a war zone. And I knew that he was never going to tell me what it was like because he wanted to protect his mom, but, you know, as a counselor, I needed to know. So, I became what's called a military family life consultant, which is, uh, you know, a mental health professional who works with the military, and I did that work for a while. And then, I eventually became one of the cadre speakers that speaks at the Yellow Ribbon programs, now, that we have for our returning veterans. 

00:02:25
DR. SHANNON DERMER Wow. We want to thank your son for his service and you...

00:02:45
KIM OLVER Okay, we want to talk to you today about the emotional cycle of deployment. There is a predictable cycle that military members and their families go through during a deployment. There are seven stages; two of them happen pre-deployment, three happen during the deployment, and two happen once the service member returns home. The first two are anticipation of departure and detachment and withdrawal. The three that happen during deployment are emotional disorganization, recovery and stabilization, and anticipation of return. Then, once the service member is back, they go into a, a phase of return adjustment and renegotiation, and finally, they settle into what we call reintegration and stabilization. We'll look at each one of those individually. So, the anticipation of departure starts as soon as the soldier gets their orders and they know that the deployment is coming. A lot of the, uh, reactions to this time start with denial. There's a period of time where both the service member and the family member pretend as if nothing's happening and life goes on business as usual. Then, they get into thinking about the anticipation of loss, and the first loss they think about is loss of that one year period of time, anywhere from six months to a year that the service member is gone. Both people are going to lose that time in each others' lives. There's also conflict that happens during this phase: Service members have the conflict of actually feeling good about being called up for service, being able to use their skills and serve their country, and they also are conflicted about taking care of their families and not being there when they want to be there for their families. Family members have the same conflict: They want to be proud of their service members, they want to support the service that they're providing to the country, and at the same time, they want their service member home with them and the family. There may be some disagreements during this period, and often, those disagreements are about how to spend time. The service member's being pulled in the direction of the to-do list for deployment and deployment training while the family member wants to create special memories and have quality time with their service member before they leave. This can lead to some angry moments, some resentment. There's a restlessness that comes up during this period, also, because of the lack of control and power that people have to prevent this deployment from happening. People can go into depression at this time, and there's irritability, and you'll notice irritability is one of the emotions that kind of goes throughout the whole deployment cycle. There's also a bewilderment, sometimes confusion, over a lot of things that the military can throw at family members. There's a lot of acronyms that get thrown around, and civilians really don't understand what those acronyms stand for. Uh, there's also sadness and fear; fear about your loved one's safety. The next stage is that detachment and withdrawal phase, and this is a, a period that when I talk about this to military members and their families, you'll see a lot of elbow jabbing and heads turning because they can really relate to this. It usually happens about a month before the service member leaves. They start to pull away from each other and they start to build walls around each other, and they really start to bicker a lot more, and it seems like leaving when anger is in the equation is a little bit easier than leaving when they're feeling very connected. So, that emotional distance happens; there's a sadness during this time because they're trying to stay connected but really, their emotions are pulling them apart. There can be despair over what's about to happen, a hopelessness about not being able to stop the deployment. There'll be greater conflict as they go, and this usually is conflict between each other; they'll fight over the silliest things just so that they can create that emotional distance. A lot of people feel a lack of energy during this stage, and that just comes from the emotional roller-coaster that people are on as they prepare for deployment. There's indecision, also, and there's a good thing there is because this is not a time to be making big decisions, and there's a lot of focus on the what ifs; what if my loved one is hurt or injured, what if he's killed, what if my family can't handle the time when I'm away? There's a lot of those what ifs, and even fidelity becomes a question that people are concerned about. Will my partner be able to stay faithful while I'm gone? The next period is emotional disorganization, and this usually starts when the, when the service member goes to deployment, and it happens on both sides. And it usually happens when both parties take a little break from the daily routine of what's happening, and it's a time when emotions run rampant, and there's not a lot to do. Service members experience this as they're traveling to their destination; there's a lot of down time, a lot of travel time, there's no mission to focus on, so they have a period of time where there's no routine and there's a lot of time for reflection, and emotions can run rampant. The family has a situation where a lot of times when their service member leaves, they're actually relieved, and they're relieved because of all the stress and strain of the time leading up to that deployment. Then, they feel a little bit guilty about being relieved. I remember this one woman who told me that her, when her service member left, her husband left, for deployment, and something happened at the airport, and he was going to be delayed 24 hours, so he came back home. And she said, 'what are you doing here?' And he said, 'well, I have another day; I couldn't leave today.' And so, she did whatever adjustments she needed to, and the next day, as he was leaving to deploy, she said, 'honey, if this happens again, please don't come home. Stay at the airport, stay at a hotel; I can't go through this again.' So, during this phase, there's definitely a restlessness; there's no routine, so there's some confusion, people report feeling disorganized and not really having any, uh, goals or any routines ahead of them, they're indecisive, irritable, they have trouble sleeping - which is not a big surprise because the person they'd been sleeping with for the last several years is not there anymore. There's an anxiety about what the, what is this going to be like? What's going to happen? And then, there's also a loneliness as you miss the person who's gone, and a frustration sets in, a frustration over the fact that there's nothing that can be done to change the situation. That phase should only last about a week, two at tops, and then they move into a period of stability and recovery. And hopefully, this period lasts for almost the duration of the deployment, and this is where routines start to be, uh, set again. They'll go into old routines, but they have to add new ones because there's new responsibilities to handle. Military members are getting their routines and their missions, and they have, uh, things set for them, and now, families start to do the same. Some people during this period will continually feel stressed because there, there's more on them, there's more things that they have to attend to. They'll sometimes have mixed feelings of success and failure. Some days, they feel like, 'I got this; I can handle this,' and the next day, they'll feel like, 'I'm just not going to get through this. It's too hard.' There's, uh, some people will maintain a sense of depression or anxiety throughout this whole time; it usually is mild and it's something that just underlies the life that they're leading as they go through everything that they're working on. Some family members feel vulnerable; their rock, the person that keeps them safe, is gone, and so, they feel a sense of vulnerability. And then, there's some people who really do well and thrive during this time. They feel in control, they develop a great sense of independence, they're able to handle things, they develop a confidence in what's going on. And the deployment turns out to be a very healthy thing for them. About a month before we find out that the soldier is going to come back, there's the anticipation of return, and that anticipation of return happens when we know that the, the service member's coming back. There's an excitement on both ends. Everybody's happy and excited to, to get home, there's an anticipation of what that's going to be like, and the anticipation is usually, uh, very high expectations for what's going to happen. There's also an apprehension, there's a nervousness, about, 'what's going to be different, what's changed? I know my, my service member has been through some things; I don't know how that's changed him or her.' Most service members come home expecting that nothing has changed even though a whole year has gone by. So, the people at home sometimes are nervous about how will that service member look at the things that have changed around here? 'Maybe I've lost some weight, maybe I've gained some weight, maybe I changed the color of the bedroom to a color that he or she may not like.' So, there's a restlessness around that. There's also indecision during this phase, and a lot of this comes from, 'do I bring everybody to the airport to have a big party when my service member comes home, or do I go by myself and maybe sneak off and have a little quiet retreat or respite when he comes back?' There can also be irritability during this phase, and a lot of time, that irritability comes from well-intended people who are giving advice about what family members should do when they may not even have any understanding of what that person is going through. The service member comes back, and it's like a honeymoon phase all over again; everybody's happy, everybody's trying to make up for the past year of, of time apart. Things are pretty good for a while. There's less independence and more interdependence as people start leaning on each other again for things that maybe they did before the deployment. There can sometimes be a resentment during this time, and that resentment comes from expectations, usually. Family members may expect that as soon as the service member walks in the door, they're going to take over everything that they, uh, left while they were gone, and maybe the service member isn't ready to do that. Or, the opposite may be true; the service member may walk in and resent the way family members maybe handled some things while they were away, and they want to take over things again, and the family member may not be ready for that. So, sometimes, that can be the cause of some resentment. There can also be irritability during this phase, as you try to reacquaint yourself with each other. This is the time when families and service members are trying to negotiate what we've come to call the 'new normal.' Things will never go back to the way they were before, and to expect that to happen is, uh, folly, so we want to make sure that people have a sense of you're trying to get to a new normal, not the way things used to be. The last stage is reintegration and stabilization. This takes patience; this doesn't happen overnight. You want to remind your clients that it's going to take a while. You want to help them with effective communication so that they can speak to each other during this time in a way that supports their, uh, their renegotiation. You want to encourage people to take this time slow and to lower their expectations so that people aren't disappointed. I want to also share with you a slide on deployment resources. You need to be aware of these resources if you're working with military families. It's important that you know about Military OneSource. Most questions for military members and their families can be answered there. There's also AfterDeployment.org, which has good information for deployment; there's some financial information at DFAS.mil; Fort Family has good resources for the family; Military Family Network, also excellent resources; there's joint service support; Operation Military Kids has great stuff for children of family members; and Military Homefront also provides some excellent resources for service members and their families. So, if you're working with military families and service members, make sure you're familiar with these resources and that you can send families and their service members there. So, hopefully, during this talk, you've learned some things that will help you help military members and their families create a smoother deployment, recognize how their emotions, however strong they may be, are normal, help them find ways to support their loved one and develop new coping strategies so they can manage stress levels better, help them to openly share their feelings with each other, and help their children cope because their children are going through the same military deployment cycle as their parents are. You want to help families build resilience so they can handle multiple deployments.

Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:16:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER Kim, thank you so much for that informative talk on the military deployment. And I have to say, I have never had the experience of having a family member in the military, like you have. I did have some experience counseling with the military, though, when I was a doctoral student; uh, we were right next to Fort Riley. And I remember being shocked that the military really is its own culture; it's like its own town - for the people who are in full-time service - its own town, its own housing, its own, uh, language, as you mentioned. Uh, I'm wondering if you have noticed any difference between people who deploy who military is their full-time career, versus people who are in the Reserves, who aren't part of that every day culture in the military. 

00:17:45
Kim Olver 

00:17:45
KIM OLVER Absolutely, I do, and, in fact, the presentation that I did was, uh, a presentation that was done for the Yellow Ribbon events, uh, by the Department of Defense and Penn State University. And they do those Yellow Ribbon events for the Guard and for the Reservists because the huge difference is that most people in the Reserve and the Guard, they're individuals; they're not living on a base, they don't have that culture supporting them, they don't have neighbors who know exactly what they're going through. A lot of the things that I hear from people is, you know, they'll say that their husband or their father's in Afghanistan, and there are people who will say, 'oh, are we still fighting a war over there?' So, there's a real misunderstanding that happens with family members of the military when they're not in a base, so I think that being on the base can be very helpful for military. And when they're Reservists and, uh, Guard, living a civilian lifestyle most of the time, that deployment can be even harder. 

00:18:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER Now, I imagine you, even though it scared you that you were supportive of your son going into the military, um, something that I've noticed, though, or I noticed when I was working with military families, is that while many are very proud that their family member is in the service, um, a lot of people resent, as you talked about, that time that their family member is away. How do you deal with that resentment? 

00:19:10
KIM OLVER It takes a special person to be able to support a person in the military. I always say, when I'm talking to audiences, the only thing harder than being in the service is loving someone who is. 

00:19:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER (inaudible ). 

00:19:25
KIM OLVER And I really mean that because they're doing their job, they're doing the thing they're trained to do. When they get deployed, they're, uh, many people are actually happy; it's like, 'wow, I get to put my skills to use, I have a purpose.' And those of us left at home are, are left to support, to understand, and, really, work hard at being proud as opposed to resentful. And I think it's okay to let our clients know that feeling both is all right, and it doesn't make you a bad person; you're allowed to be a little bit selfish and wish your partner were home or your, your kids' father were there, mother were there, but you don't let those feelings overtake everything, and you remember the, the, that they're coming home, and that you'll have that time again. 

00:20:05
DR. SHANNON DERMER Yeah, it's a lot different than saying goodbye to a family member who's leaving for a job where their life isn't at risk... 

00:20:10
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:20:10
KIM OLVER Right. 

00:20:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER ...or your, um, son or daughter who's going to college and you know that there's good things that are going to happen to them, um, you know there's going to be hardship when you send your, your family member out to serve, you know, uh, in action. Um, what do you think is the hardest adjustment for when the service member comes home? 

00:20:35
KIM OLVER Hmm, I think the hardest adjustment is that, that balance that we do of needing together time and needing space. A lot of time, the person who's been left back, left home, wants together time - they've been deprived of that and they need that close time. And a lot of times, military members needs that decompression time; they need space. In fact, my son was engaged when he came home, and they broke up because his fiancee needed that together time and he needed his space. The good news is, three years later, they found each other again, and now she's my daughter in law, and... 

00:21:15
Kim Olver 

00:21:15
DR. SHANNON DERMER Aw. 

00:21:15
KIM OLVER ...I'm the grandmother of their children, so it all worked out. But that is a real conflict, and probably the hardest thing to negotiate. 

00:21:25
DR. SHANNON DERMER What, uh, so there are many people who've had experience with having family members in the military, um, but what kind of advice would you give to a clinician who's working with family members of a military person, who've never experienced having a family member, themselves, in the military? 

00:21:45
KIM OLVER I would really encourage them to encourage the family to find support systems, and I don't mean their usual support system of, you know, mom, sister, best friend; those are important, and I'm not saying dismiss those, by any means, but find people who have been through what they're going through that can kind of help them through the process, almost like, uh, a support group would be. You want to, you want to find people who have been there and have successful navigated those waters to help that person get through. 

00:22:15
DR. SHANNON DERMER Do you find that most people naturally seek out those resources from in the military, or that some people just don't know or don't want to use those resources? 

00:22:25
KIM OLVER Some people don't know; again, that's one of the purposes of the Yellow Ribbon Program, is to help them connect with and, and learn about their resources, but there's also that culture of the military where, you know, especially the Army - 'we are Army strong' - and Army strong is great and, and Army strong gets us through, but there's times when we're not strong and we need those resources. So, sometimes, the culture can be preventive in people reaching out and getting those resources, but I find family members are more likely to do it. So, talking with the family members about what's out there and available, uh, usually gets them connected and tapped in. 

00:23:00
DR. SHANNON DERMER And what, um, what led you to get - besides that your son was in the military, what led you to get connected to this, um, emotional cycle of deployment, because it's not really something I had heard about before. You know, I hear about individual, you know, development cycle, um, family development cycle, but not this particular, um, cycle. What led you to get connected with this idea? 

00:23:25
KIM OLVER Well, it came through my work as a speaker. Um, it was a topic that, uh, people really needed to hear about because a lot of individuals, you know, I'm working with Reservists and Guards, Guards, you know, National Guard. And they're experiencing this and they feel like it's in a vacuum and nobody else feels this way, and that they're going crazy and that there's something wrong with them. So, it was very helpful when Penn State came out with this model of the emotional cycle of deployment to just be able to share that with family members and service members so they can understand what's happening and that it is normal and that they're not alone. 

00:24:05
DR. SHANNON DERMER Mm-hmm. You know, sometimes, um, as clinicians, we are engaged in premarital counseling, telling people what to expect with this big, huge transition in their lives. Uh, do you think that every family should go through pre-deployment counseling? 

00:24:20
KIM OLVER I, I do, and, uh, you know, they do get that at a Yellow Ribbon Event. They have Yellow Ribbon events prior to deployment for service members and families, but I also think that in, in therapy, it could be very helpful to, to really specifically hone in on that particular family and what that particular family needs because at Yellow Ribbon, we talk in generalities and... 

00:24:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER Mm-hmm. 

00:24:45
KIM OLVER ...you know, I think with counseling, it can really help understand your particular emotions as you go through that deployment cycle. 

00:24:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER So, uh, most, if not all, of the families get some general type, uh, maybe psycho-education into what to expect and what will happen, but you feel, uh, like that individualized help would also be very helpful for military families? 

00:25:05
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:25:05
KIM OLVER I really do, yes. 

00:25:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER Okay. I would like you to say a little bit more - because it may be surprising to some people - a little bit more about that emotional distancing that happens before, because everyone thinks, 'oh, you want to spend every last second that you can with your military, uh, member,' but, um... 

00:25:25
KIM OLVER There... 

00:25:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER ...I can understand that distancing, so say a little bit (inaudible ). 

00:25:35
Kim Olver 

00:25:35
KIM OLVER There comes a point when you want to just kick them right out the door. Um, it hap-, well, it happens because that, that time is such high stress for people and the loyalties are divided. I mean, service members really are conflicted. They do want to take care of their families and they want to be there for them, but they also have this higher calling, and that's the commitment that they made to the military, so, you know, they have so many things that they have to do before they leave, and there's training that they have to go through, so their time is really allocated with the military, and it takes a lot of time away from families. So, that stress and that push-pull - 'I want you here,' 'well, I, I have to be at the barracks, I have to be with the troops,' - it, it really can be stressful. So, by the time the, the deployment comes, you're ready. It's like, 'okay, hurry up and go so that you can hurry up and get back,' and, and it also helps them when they're saying goodbye; it's not as painful when they're a little annoyed with each other than it is if they were, 'oh, I miss you.' You know, so, it's, it's self-protective. 

00:26:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER It is, and if someone comes back, you know, unharmed, I suppose, you know, you move through that, but I imagine there's a whole 'nother level of guilt and grief if you had that distancing beforehand and something happens to them, whether they're hurt or killed, when they're away. 

00:26:55
KIM OLVER Yes, but what happens, also, in these wars, which, it's a, there's pros and cons on both sides of this issue, but communication is so much easier now than it has been in the past, so even though that period of emotional distance happened, people reconnect via Skype and, you know, email and things like that. So, I don't think that's as much of an issue if something does happen; usually, they've reconnected and, and found their way back to each other before that happens. 

00:27:25
DR. SHANNON DERMER That's an excellent point, the fact that there is a whole different level of communication in the last, you know, ten, fifteen years; email, uh, Skyping, um, many other forms of communication. So, your point is, even if you don't do the pre-deployment perfectly, you have a chance to connect and reconnect and connect and reconnect and keep working through it. 

00:27:50
KIM OLVER Yes. 

00:27:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER Okay. 

00:27:50
KIM OLVER Yep. 

00:27:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER We have a little bit of time left, but if you had to, uh - and I know you talked a little bit about this in your talk - but if you had to boil things down to one piece of best advice for a family who is about to have a family member, um, deployed, what would that be? 

00:28:10
KIM OLVER Hmm. 

00:28:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER I know that's a tough one. 

00:28:10
KIM OLVER Oh, one piece of advice; I think what I would say is support your military member and get the help that you need to support yourself. Don't count on your military member to be your support system because they're not going to be able to do that for you. So, you need to find your own way of supporting yourself and taking care of yourself so that you can be the best you while your family member is gone, and, and you do your service while they're doing theirs. 

00:28:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER That's right. Service, uh, to the country isn't just the person who's deployed, it's the whole family. 

00:28:40
KIM OLVER It is. 

00:28:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER Okay. Well, thank you so much, Kim Olver, for helping us understand a little bit more about the emotional cycle of deployment. If you'd like to know more about, uh, Kim's talk or some of our other experts, please visit the website for Alexander Street Press. And I want to thank you, and especially you, Kim, for joining us today.
