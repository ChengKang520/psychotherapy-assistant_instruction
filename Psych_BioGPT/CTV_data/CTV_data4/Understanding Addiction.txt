RICHARD HILL Have you ever watched while someone you cared about drank until he literally fell down trying to walk out of a bar? What about seeing the desperation on the face of a loved one trying to win back some of the thousands lost at the blackjack table? Or grimly helped carry out the spoils of victory that came in the latest shopping spree of a near and dear compulsive spender, especially when you know her credit cards are now maxed out? Hi, I'm Richard Hill, and this talk is about explaining how all of those seemingly unrelated behaviors, and more, are in fact coming from the same brain wiring, or perhaps we should say brin re-wiring. But that's indeed the process we're talking about when we discuss substance abuse and compulsive behaviors. For the next half hour or so, I'll be going over a few aspects of addiction and compulsion with the purpose of showing how, regardless of which behavior someone is doing to excess, they are acting from the same neurological impairment. We'll define addiction and give you a mnemonic to help you remember the five crucial elements of it; and five is a big number, again, when we look at the stages of addiction. It's also, uh, to discuss a few things that you can do to aid the addict; from setting boundaries to eliminating triggers, there are ways to support those in the cruel grip of compulsion. So, first, let's see what this is all about. What do the statistics say about the effects of out of control behavior on addicts, their families, and really all of the community? Here are some of, well, what really are rather frightening statistics. Over 3,000 deaths per year are attributed to excessive consumption of alcohol in Australia. Over 5,000 - that's five percent - of all cancers, are due to chronic, long-term, abusive alcohol. Alcohol and, alcoholism is a factor in the development of liver, breast, and esophageal cancer, among others. Eight percent of Australians have had a drug addiction problem, and this estimate actually in-, excludes alcohol. Of drug users, about 47 percent had used prescription drugs for non-medical purposes more than once in the month prior to being surveyed. Problem gamblers, gamblers lose about 12,000 dollars a year, as opposed to around 650 for non-problem gamblers. The job performance of nearly 50,000 gamblers is adversely affected by their gambling. Sadly, the statistics go on and on, but let's get a common definition of what we mean when we talk about addiction or compulsion. I, you know, I, I, I kind of use these terms interchangeably, um, during the talk cuz they're similar, but interchangeable, I think. The American Society of Addiction Medicine defines addiction as a primary chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory, and related circuitry which results in the continued use of a mood-altering substance or behavior despite adversive consequences or a neurological impairment leading to such behaviors. We now know that there are five crucial elements in these definitions, and we can use the A-B-C-D-E mnemonic to help us remember them. With addiction, there is abstinence inability, behavioral control impairment, craving or increased hunger for drugs or reward experiences, denial and diminished recognition of significant problems in one's behavior and relationships, and emotional response that is dysfunctional. So, let's take these one at a time because we can really drill down into these if you can give you some insight. Abstinence inability means that a person suffering from addiction finds it impossible to consistently, uh, stay, abstain from the substance or the behavior; the alcoholic cannot leave the liquor alone, the sex addict must find another object of sexual gratification or conquest, and the over-eater wants another binge as soon as their stomach stops hurting from the last one. Whether it's a substance abuse, such as heroin, or behavior, such as spending, there's a sense of urgency or a 'must do' or a 'must have'. Behavioral control impairment occurs when the repeated engagement in the substance or, and/or the behavior causes adaptation in the neurological circuitry of the brain which leads to inferred, impaired control over further drug use and addictive behavior: changes in the frontal cortex of the brain involved in inhibiting compulsivity making it difficult to the glade, uh, gratification, even if having the substance or behavior leads to aversive consequences in the person's life. The person begins to lose the mental mechanisms that help stop the behavior. Craving, or increased hunger for drugs or rewarding experiences: this element means that because of other cognitive changes resulting from the addiction, there's a preoccupation with substance use or compulsive behavior. The person's behavior choices narrow to focus on rewards that are part of the addiction. In other words, in addition to not being able to stop the behavior, the addict now becomes less and less interested in anything that is not the addiction. It doesn't matter, in, in terms of brain activity, whether the addiction is being acted out with heroine or with hypersexualtiy. Brain imaging studies show that substance abuse and behavioral addictions have much in common, as many of the same areas of the brain are activated or lit up in a FMRI during the anticipation of the reward. Denial and diminishment recognition of significant problems in one's behavior and relationships: part of the cognitive changes which occur with addiction are that the affected person has an altered evaluation of the relative benefits and costs associated with drugs or rewarding behaviors, and also tends to inaccurately believe that problems experienced in life are attributable to causing, uh, to causes other than the addiction. Now, this denial combines with difficulty in identifying feelings and describing them to other people. In major self-deception, the addict experiences problems (inaudible ) personal relationships. Impaired social functioning, in turn, affects his or her resilience and coping abilities. Emotional response which is dysfunctional: with addiction, there's generally increased anxiety, depression - particularly long-term - and emotional pain. There's increased sensitivity to stressors; things just seem more stressful. Beyond that, at the time, the substances or behaviors come to be associated with decreasing reward in the circuitry of the brain, such that the same amount of, say, marijuana, or the same amount of binge eating, will be subjectively experienced by the addict as less rewarding. When the person receives less of a high for the same behavior, he or she's driven to engage even more in the substance use or in the behavior in order to create the former euphoric state's experience. Thus, tolerance develops. Then, while a person seeks the high more and more, what they mostly experience is a deeper and deeper low. Now, as time goes on, the person may not even experience the high. What they experience much more is the low, and the need for the, the substance or the behavior shifts to avoid this, the terrible symptoms of the low: the withdrawal. Thus, we see how addiction comes to be a forced, rather than chosen, behavior, altering the thoughts, emotions, and interpersonal behaviors of the addict. So, how can we tell, uh, when we or someone we know is becoming an addict? there are five stages of addiction. If addiction is an illness, wherein a person's drives are operating improbab-, improperly, then the stages of addiction are the signposts that indicate how far down the road those drives have taken them. For the next few minutes, let's say you have a friend named Dave. He's a good mate, but lately he's been behaving in strange ways towards women and sexuality. Now, you think back over the last 18 months or so, and realize that you can divide Dave's growing obsession with sex into several stages. In fact, they match the stages of addiction. This is what you've noticed. Stage One: experimentation. About a year and a half ago, you recall being at a party with Dave when, unbeknownst to both of you, a stripper was hired to come and do her thing. And while most of, uh, of you attending the party, you know, just laugh it off, uh, uh, as an entertaining part of the routine and went back to drinking and chatting, Dave was sort of entranced. He tried to get her details, and then he wanted you to come with him to her next performance. Well, now, you're realizing that this was probably where it all started cuz soon after that, Dave began to go into nightclubs that had (inaudible ). You also began to notice pornographic magazines at his house, which you'd never seen before, and you thought Dave was just, you know, playing with porn, that it wasn't too serious, that he would, was going to grow out of these, um, phase of experimenting with it, uh, where it was (inaudible ). Well, in fact, the opposite began to happen and Dave kept going, and he went down the road into Stage Two. The Stage Two: regular use, sometimes called misuse. Here, people are not truly addicted, but some may remain at this stage for several months or even years, possibly never becoming a, a, a complete addict. Generally, this is a time when the negative consequences of doing the substances or behavior begin to make themselves known. In Dave's case, being at Stage Two meant that he became a regular at one of the local clubs, which features a strip tease act every night. Dave got into a habit of going on Fridays, and once, when you suggested you go to a movie instead, which he used to love doing, he refused, saying he needed the fun of the club to unwind. His wife found out, and was really hurt, accusing him of being addicted. He said he, he couldn't be because, cuz he could stop any time, which he did seem to do for a while. But as all the fuss died down, he started back going to the club in conjunction with, well, as you found out on his work computer, uh, one day, seriously visiting porno sites. When Dave casually mentioned that he might just like to meet one of the gorgeous dolls he was seeing on the sites, you realized that he was probably evolving to Stage Three. Stage Three: risky use, also known and called abuse. The point at which Dave may have crossed the line from regular use to risky use, or abuse, is not a clear one for you, even observing as a close friend. What began to be clear to you were the escalating relational, financial, legal, health consequences that Dave was beginning to experience. His relationship with his wife was at an all-time low. He met up with a few of the girls from the pornographic sites, and, well, one became pregnant, threatened to sue him for major amounts of money if he didn't accept responsibility and pledge ongoing child support. His work was suffering from reduced energy from the hours given to his addiction. He was sneaking off early to meet women, and coming in with little sleep from having been all up, uh, up, uh, all night at the, at the nightclub. Well, he began to look washed out and exhausted, he couldn't concentrate at work, (inaudible ) you began to realize somewhere along that area that Dave was probably coming into Stage Four. Uh, Stage Four: dependence. Many people at Stage Four appear to be quite functional, although the underlying reality is that work, personal, and social obligations are not being met. In Dave's case, this was certainly true. As you worked with Dave, you realized that the rumors flying around about his decreased performance meant that his job had come into jeopardy. Similarly, his wife confided to you that she didn't know how much more of this behavior she could take. He was completely absent from all domestic happenings in their household and, and utterly vacant on an emotional level. Literally, there was nothing left for her to stay in the relationship for, yet, he was so moody and aggressive, uh, that she hesitated to confront him, and instead, well, she tended to walk on eggshells around him when we was recovering from, well, what he described as being on a sexual mission. The reality for Dave at this stage, you realize, was that his claimed functionality was just a facade. In reality, he had already become addicted to hypersexuality and the manipulation, justification, defensiveness was probably only going to increase as he attempted to keep up his new way of life. Dave had arrived at Stage Five: addiction. The last stage of persistent abuse of substances or compulsive repetition of harmful behaviors is addiction. You finally acknowledge that, for Dave, this meant that he no longer had a choice, and he was engaging with the hypersexuality under compulsions generated by changed brain circuitry dictating that new sexual conquests were rewarding and must be undertaken at all costs. Out of control, and often, often not even enjoying the high as much as needing to avoid withdrawal, Dave was engendering repeated negative consequences and harm from his actions. Ultimately, his addiction to sex cost him his marriage, his job, and his health, and his friendship with you was forever strained by this sad compulsion to seek out unhealthy ilicit sex. With Dave, you fully comprehend how addiction is a progressive, chronic, and for some people, fatal disease. The Intercept Intervention Website states that, "if left untreated, addiction can only lead to jails, institutions, death, and dereliction in no specific order." Addiction can be a very serious condition. Let's look briefly at how different addictions can be recognized. Recognizing addiction: in this talk, we're looking at addiction and compulsion more in general terms, as a phenomenon which, regardless of which type of addictive behavior we're talking about, changes the underlying brain circuitry, making it difficult to stop doing the behavior or using the substance, or stop, you know, stop using the substance. We're mostly considering the six major forms of addiction or compulsion; uh, that is, alcohol, drugs, gambling, compulsive overeating, hypersexuality, and compulsive overspending. Although, there are other forms of compulsions, such as over-exercising or excessive use of caffeine, uh, or, as we're now learning, sugar. Of course, each additional, uh, addiction has its own set of tell-tale signs and symptoms, oh, such as the red eyes and heightened perception of the marijuana user, or the reduced inhibitions of those taking party drugs. To get more specific, detailed information on each of these six, I recommend that you enroll in the AIPC course, Aiding Addicts, which is part of the Mental Health Social Support Series. Um, visit the website that you see on the screen, and that'll let you know about that. You know, again, excellent course that we've seen, here. But that's it. There are some basic characteristics of addiction that do not change much between the various manifestations. We can say that, generally, when addictive, compulsive behavior is showing up, you will find escape - the person engages in the substance or behavior in order to improve mood, relieve stress, to escape some problem; tolerance - the person needs to ingest more of the substance, to engage in more of the behavior, to get the same effect. Well, eventually this includes doing the substance or behavior not for reward anymore, but just to feel normal. And there is a strong compulsion or preoccupation to engage in the substance or the behavior. Doing more than intended; the person is drinking or doing more of the drug, spending more, having more sexual encounters, or eating all, uh, on the plate despite being full. And attempting to hide the behavior or the extent of it; an inordinate amount of time, energy, and probably money, is spent doing the substance or behavior, or recovering from it, and the person may even lie about the extent of their involvement. Withdrawal symptoms or binging behaviors occur when the person tries to reduce or quit. Becoming irritable: if the person is not able to engage in the behavior or substance, he or she becomes cranky or depressed. There's a decreasing interest in or giving up of activities that are not related to the substance or behavior, but in order to engage in it more. With over-eating, as one example, people may give up activities because of embarrassment about their weight. Having legal, financial, relational, health problems as a result: this includes others being concerned about the behavior. Continuing the substance or behavior, even though it's causing problems. The person acknowledges the problem, but carries on drinking, spending, gambling, or, or whatever, often blaming other factors or people for the problems. The person is neglecting responsibilities because of the substance, uh, abuse or of the behavior. The person is struggling to reduce the substance use or behavior problems and is failing. Engaging in illegal or immoral acts: the person may steal, for instance, in order to fund drug use, uh, or their spending sprees. Bailout: the person turns to third parties for financial assistance, either to, to continue the behavior or substance abuse, or to pay off debts incurred because of it, such as a problem gambling. If you have dealt with addiction on either a personal or professional level, you may be familiar with these symptoms. You're possibly not as well versed in what you can do about it when you find that someone you know is dealing with an addiction. So, let's take a look at that, now. What you can do. Some doctors and social workers and mental health practitioners - many counselors, psychotherapists, and psychologists - make a career out of dealing with alcohol and drug problems. Now, if that's you, in this clip, there may be things that are less relevant, and I, I may not be offering new information. But if you don't deal with addiction regularly, especially if you're a non-professional mental health social support person, then stay tuned; I'll be suggesting both a general stance, and also specific behaviors that will help you help the addict. This is a general stance, a framework for addict aiding. If you're dealing with addiction, it's well to remember a few basics. Addiction is a disease; it's not a manifestation of weak will or moral failing. And not all treatments for disease work equally well, especially on the first attempt. So, you may be trying and the addict may be trying, but they still may continue to exhibit out of control, destructive behavior. Unless you're trained particularly in addiction treatment and recovery, some of what you do towards helping may end up having the opposite effect. And that happens because some of what does help seems initially counter-intuitive. You're unlikely to get it totally right all the time, so don't hold that expectation. Other addictions and personality disorders frequently occur at the same time as the addiction that you're trying to help someone overcome. It makes the picture even more complicated, and the beneficial effect of your actions can be less certain. The important thing to do is to remember that you are not the addict, and so you cannot control what happens to the addict. Therefore, you are not responsible for their life; only they are. You may do a stellar job of throwing a lifeline their way, but really, if they don't grab it, this is not a fault of yours. Addiction therapy is full of ups and downs. Addiction is being generally spoken of as being, uh, treated or possibly in remission, and addicts are in recovery or clean or sober for a certain time. But the person in not usually referred to as being cured of the disease. Now, this meaning acknowledges that relapse can occur at any time. How you treat yourself in this work is just as important to the addict's ultimate excess, success as how you treat the addict. You may have to face the realization that sometimes your actions or attitudes can serve to maintain or sadly, even strengthen the addiction. With addiction, you want to be compassionate and helpful, but sometimes the best way to do that is by standing firm and engaged in well-boundaried tough love. Well, here are some specifics that go with this stance. Addict supporting: the specifics. First, understand addiction. This goes for both you and the addict. To help someone overcome addiction, you both need to know what you're getting into. If acts are ready, uh, if addicts are ready to hear it, there's a, a wealth of free literature available to support their recovery. The more you know, the more supportive and compassionate you can be. The more the addict knows, the more he or she can take the responsibility they need to for healing into his or her own hands. Get help, including around your possible roll as an enabler. This is a less well known one, but even as a counselor, it's possible to behave in a way that enables an addict to continue dysfunctional, compulsive behavior. Now, have you done any of the following: loaned the addict money as a friend or family supporter, or unintentionally enabled mismanagement of finances by inappropriately allowing the addict to run up a tab of counseling sessions? That's the same as lending them money. Allowed the addict to lie or deceive you, unchallenged, about the extent of their involvement with the addiction, especially when it's obvious that they're not telling the truth; for example, the alcoholic that says he's not been drinking, but then he comes to a session or has been going home with alcohol on his breath. Observed excessive compulsive behaviors and refused to confront the addict about them? You've done this, seen these behaviors, but, like watching a fashion victim spend more than she can afford on new clothes, especially when they may not be may, needed. To, have you be rest, have you rescued the addict from themself? (inaudible ) by regularly agreeing to pick them up at the bar to bring them home. It seems like a really positive idea, but it can relieve them of the responsibility of their drinking responsibility of drinking responsibly, or perhaps you've not set boundaries, uh, around the use of alcohol prior to counseling sessions or around the use of household funds to support the addiction? No, I'm not wanting to appear harsh; you, you can create porous boundaries which keep both parties enabled. You don't want to do that. Have you avoided confronting the act, the addict with out of control behavior because you (inaudible ) confrontation? Or, sometimes for counselors, you fear losing them as a client. Here's a small sample of the ways in which you can enable a client. Remove triggers and plan fun things away from a triggered environment. For example, friends and family members of a compulsive over-eater may choose to meet up for an activity, say a walk, rather than go to a restaurant. Use your counseling micro-skills for laypeople as well as counselors to both listen and to confront where appropriate. Organize a formal intervention to explore the addiction. Confront the person with their addictive behaviors and assess their red, readiness to seek treatment. Again, this can be initiated by a counselor or by a concerned family member or by a friend. Readiness for treatment can range from, well, complete denial all the way to, 'I'll do anything to get past this,' some more a form of surrender than a form of strength of will. Many will fall somewhere in between. Remember that quitting is easy. Staying quit is tough. Addicts will need all the recovery capital, capital they can amass. You can help them by encouraging them to understand that. It's okay to ask for help. They need to choose their recovery team wisely and while good friends, family members, and effective counselors are important, research shows that the most important supports are those who have been there, done that; that is, fellow recovering addicts, those a bit further down the recovery track. Encourage their attendance at the 12-step or other recovery meetings. If you're a family member, you probably need to go to your own meetings for the first year. Staying on the wagon is really important. They must be patient with themselves. You must practice detachment (inaudible ) mis-identification. You must protect yourself, including, if necessary, by walking away, or for counselors, setting down boundaries on how, where, and in what way you are prepared to work with them. So, what might you expect when a person is in recovery from their compulsion? What to expect in recovery. Let's say you have been a highly effective support person. You waited patiently for the right time, organized a formal intervention just after your addict hit rock bottom. The addict went into complete surrender and enrolled in a treatment program. Eventually, the person will come out of rehabilitation and be considered to be in recovery. Well, what does this mean? What can you, as a support person, expect the former addict to experience? Recovery from a compulsion or addiction can be divided into four phases: initiation into recovery, which often occurs during treatment, rehabilitation, beginning recovery, it's those first few months of sobriety or clean living, you know, without whatever the, the problem behavior is, when the individual will have to adapt to life without the alcohol, drugs, gambling, sex, binge eating, or, or excessive spending. Recovery maintenance: from around the third month or so, up to about two years, when the person has really begun to settle into recovery, but needs to put work into staying sober or clean. Advanced recovery: after around two years, when the former addict can be considered to be in a stable place of recovery. The person is by no means cured, but doing the things he or she needs to do to stay sober or free of the problem behavior. The non-addicted behavior will become second nature, become normalized. Social support: there's one aspect of supporting an addict that we haven't addressed. When the perfe-, then when the person begins their recovery, they need help with sorting out the social support. We'll think of it like this: the person coming into recovery may have had an extended stay in rehab or, worse, prison. And while there, they probably developed some mate-ships, but the prison or rehab center may be far from the community they return to, uh, live in when they come out. Moreover, it's unlikely to be in the recoveree's, uh, the recovering addict's best interests to continue hanging out with the people they knew when they were using or getting drunk or problem gambling, problem spending, et cetera. It's just too risky in the term, for the terms of, uh, relapse. So, just when the person needs social support the most, then they find that they have the least of it. Your role in this regard can be both to educate the person about how important social support is, and also to help them access both the resources and the roles that can support them. For instance, you can help the recovering addict to find, uh, fellow recovery members, a peer leader, um, who is likely to be in advanced stages of recovery and who can coach and mentor the person, a sponsor, uh, a counselor, if you're a helper, uh, you know, that's already your role as a counselor. You know, a chaplain or a minister, and any doctors or allied healthcare practitioners. You and they can help the person to feel motivated to keep sacrificing time and energy to work on the changes. You can help them be realistic, realistic about the, the efforts that will be needed, and about the likelihood of encountering plateaus where there is little visible change. Through you and other support roles, the person can feel more supported, cared for, and accepted, emboldened to pursue new paths for lifestyle change, and ultimately to feel better about him- or herself. A summary of understanding addiction: in this talk, we've tackled several major concepts in order to better understand addiction, viewing it as an adaptation of brain circuitry that forces the addict to engage in the unhealthy substance or behavior, uh, behavior action repeatedly for diminishing rewards and with decreasing awareness about their behavior. I identified the five stages of addiction, from experimentation to addiction, and talked about how to recognize when addictive compulsive behavior is showing up in a client or someone you care about. I've named things that you can do to support an addict. Addiction, whether in the form of alcohol or drug abuse or excessive gambling, eating, spending, or sex, is a cruel disease and it's a gift not only to the addict, but to all of society, to help free them from its cruel embrace.

Over 3000 deaths per year are attributed to excessive consumption of alcohol in Australia. Over 5000 (5 per cent) of all cancers are due to chronic, long-term abuse of alcohol. Alcoholism is a factor in the development of liver, breast, and oesophageal cancer, among others. 8% of Australians have had a drug addiction problem (this estimate excludes alcohol). Of drug users, about 47 per cent had used prescription drugs for non-medical purposes more than once in the month prior to being surveyed. Problem gamblers lose about $12,000 per year as opposed to $650 for non-problem gamblers. The job performance of nearly 50,000 gamblers was adversely affected by their gambling.
