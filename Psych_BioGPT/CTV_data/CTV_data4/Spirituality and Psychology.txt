NARRATOR Thinking Allowed, conversations on the leading edge of knowledge and discovery, with psychologist Jeffrey Mishlove. 

00:00:15
THINKING ALLOWED wih Jeffrey Mishlove 

00:00:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE , Ph.D. Hello and welcome. Our topic today is psychology and spirituality, and my guest, Dr. Frances Vaughan, is a clinical psychologist, and an author of several books, including The Inward Arc and Intuition. Frances, welcome. 

00:00:45
FRANCES VAUGHAN Thank you. 

00:00:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's a pleasure to have you here. 

00:00:45
FRANCES VAUGHAN Its a pleasure to be here, Jeff. 

00:00:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You write extensively about spirituality in your work, and as a former president of the Association for Transpersonal Psychology, you… you really have an extensive professional interest in the interface between spirituality and psychology. And this is an area which fascinates many people, and also confuses a lot of people, I think, because spirituality is often associated with so many dogmas. How does psychology… What… What is the role of psychology, as opposed to the role of religion, in helping people to develop spiritually? 

00:01:25
FRANCES VAUGHAN , Ph.D. AUTHOR, THE INWARD ARC Well, the way I see it is the traditional psychology tends to take a very dim view of spirituality, because psychology tends to see many people trying to avoid issues of personal confrontation with… by turning to spirituality. 

00:01:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Sort of head-in-the-clouds. 

00:01:45
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes! 

00:01:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Airy-fairy, avoiding-the-gut-feelings… 

00:01:45
FRANCES VAUGHAN Exactly! 

00:01:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …kind of criticisms. 

00:01:50
FRANCES VAUGHAN Or finding a… a kind of escape from the realities, the existential realities of our mortality, our aloneness and the situation of the human condition. 

00:02:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:02:00
FRANCES VAUGHAN And in other words, a lot of times psychologists will see spirituality as a kind of escapism. 

00:02:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:02:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN Or something that people believe in in order to make themselves feel better and but this… 

00:02:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And the converse, it almost seems to me that you have a lot of religions describing psychology in… in those same terms. 

00:02:20
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes! 

00:02:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The fundamentalists feel that it… psychology is sort of a fantasy, that they're avoiding the real issues. 

00:02:25
FRANCES VAUGHAN Exactly! So that they tend to say take that view, an oppositional stance. 

00:02:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes! 

00:02:30
FRANCES VAUGHAN Traditional spiritual teachers, for example, or traditional religions often see psychology as simply concerned with the ego, selfishness and they fail to see the value of that in terms of personal growth or healthy personal development. 

00:02:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:02:45
FRANCES VAUGHAN So… 

00:02:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Or at least not dealing with real values. 

00:02:50
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes! And so, I think there's a lot of education that needs to happen on both sides. 

00:02:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:02:55
FRANCES VAUGHAN Because, in fact, I see them as complementary aspects of human development, both of which are necessary for wholeness and for real healing… 

00:03:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:03:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN …in our lives. So, I feel that there needs to be a lot of bridging work between the two, so that people don't feel that they have to choose either a psychological discipline or a spiritual discipline, but that in fact both are important. 

00:03:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now, in your work what I've noticed is that you've drawn from many traditions. You've looked at the Christian spiritual path, you've looked at Zen Buddhism, you've looked at yoga and… and a number of others in your writings. And you seem to be saying that they all point in the same direction, don't you? 

00:03:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN Well, I like the analogy of truth as a mountain. 

00:03:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:03:45
FRANCES VAUGHAN With all the different religious paths as different approaches to climbing the mountain. So that you see many different paths up the mountain, and when you're down in the lower slopes, you may argue about the shape of the mountain. 

00:03:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:03:55
FRANCES VAUGHAN But the more you work on it and the more… the further up you go, the more you see that there's a convergence, that there are certain values, for example, that tend to be common to all different traditions. 

00:04:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:04:10
FRANCES VAUGHAN And that even though different paths provide different experiences along the way, I feel very strongly that there is a universal experience of self-transcendence that's possible, and that in fact this can be very healing for people. It can have a very positive effect in terms of their psychological development. 

00:04:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:04:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN If such an experience is appropriately integrated. 

00:04:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE A universal quality of self-transcendence. 

00:04:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes! 

00:04:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's sort of putting it in a nutshell, isn’t it? How does that translate, say to a therapy practice, when you're working with someone? 

00:04:50
FRANCES VAUGHAN Well, in… in my practice… 

00:04:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:04:50
FRANCES VAUGHAN …I find that sometimes people seek me out because they know I have a transpersonal orientation. 

00:04:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:04:55
FRANCES VAUGHAN And particularly if they've had some kind of experience that has opened up some spiritual issues for them or perhaps if they've been practicing meditation and they want someone… want to talk things over with someone who has an understanding of the practice and what those experiences might be like or they may have had some kind of spontaneous opening. 

00:05:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:20
FRANCES VAUGHAN And had an experience of self-transcendence that… that they want to make sense out of. 

00:05:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:05:25
FRANCES VAUGHAN That they want to integrate in some way. 

00:05:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Is it something that people need to seek? I mean, if a person came to you and they were having marital problems. 

00:05:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Or… Or some other type of conventional psychological problem. 

00:05:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And they don't have a thought about spiritual experience. 

00:05:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN Hmm…hmm… 

00:05:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Is… Is there any application there? 

00:05:45
FRANCES VAUGHAN Well, my… my experience is that it depends how deeply people want to do inner work. 

00:05:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah…ah… 

00:05:50
FRANCES VAUGHAN Because often people will come into therapy seeking relief for some kind of interpersonal stress. You know, some relationship issue is very common, for example, either marital problem or… or a breakup of a relationship. 

00:06:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:06:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN And… But sooner or later I think everyone has to confront themselves. 

00:06:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:06:10
FRANCES VAUGHAN And that very often in relationships we tend to think, "Well, if only the other person were different, then everything would be all right." But ultimately I think we have to take a look at what we're contributing and how we can make a difference in terms of the quality of relationships that we have in our lives. And so, as soon as we start to do this, as soon as we look at how it is that our state of being or our state of consciousness affects the relationships that we tend to bring into our lives, that were the patterns that we find ourselves repeating. 

00:06:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Can you… Can you give me an example of this? Is there an illustration, maybe, to make it a little more concrete? 

00:06:45
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes! For example, I recently have been working with a woman who is in her second marriage. And she separated from her first husband because of… he was… he had a problem with alcohol, and she felt that it was all his problem. Well, she found that she was recreating similar patterns in her second marriage. And the second time around she didn't want to just leave. She wanted to stay in the relationship and work through some of her own issues. 

00:07:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, she thought she might get rid of the problem by getting rid of the first husband. 

00:07:20
FRANCES VAUGHAN Exactly, exactly! And of course it never works. 

00:07:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:20
FRANCES VAUGHAN Because as soon as you get rid of a relationship you find that you either recreate a similar relationship or you have to deal with the same issues in yourself. 

00:07:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's like Pogo who once said, "We have found the enemy and he is us." 

00:07:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes! 

00:07:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah…ah… 

00:07:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN And I think that that's one place where spirituality and psychology converge. 

00:07:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:07:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN Because we recognize that we are all mirrors for each other in some way. 

00:07:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:07:45
FRANCES VAUGHAN I see that, for example, in some way all of my clients reflect aspects of myself. 

00:07:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Of yourself, yeah! 

00:07:50
FRANCES VAUGHAN I can empathize with them, because I know how it feels to be in the kinds of situations that they describe. 

00:08:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's almost essential for a therapist really, isn't it? 

00:08:00
FRANCES VAUGHAN Well, I think it's something that's really available to all of us. 

00:08:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah…ah… 

00:08:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN That the more we're willing to look at ourselves and understand the dynamics of the way the mind works, the more we realize that these are really universal patterns. And that people everywhere have to deal with issues of love and fear and anxiety about loss and facing death. And often it's just at these times when people feel some kind of crisis in their lives, maybe facing their own mortality or the death of someone that they're close to, that's when spiritual issues become really meaningful and important. 

00:08:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now, in the case of this particular woman that you just mentioned, how did she begin to look at spiritual issues? 

00:08:45
FRANCES VAUGHAN Well, basically it was a question of values in her life. 

00:08:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:08:50
FRANCES VAUGHAN It’s what were the things that really were most important to her? And what she came to see was that in order to really love her partner, the person she was with, she also had to take herself into account. 

00:09:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:09:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN And this is often true that it's not a matter of either loving oneself or loving someone else, it seems to be both. Both are necessary. 

00:09:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:09:15
FRANCES VAUGHAN So, I sometimes think of spirituality or spiritual disciplines as teaching us to forgive others, and psychotherapy is a way of learning to forgive ourselves. 

00:09:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's a very interesting distinction. You… In… In your work you sort of described the self as if it were an onion, with… with different layers and… 

00:09:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes. 

00:09:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE There's an existential level of the self, there's an ego level, there's a transpersonal level. Could we go through the onion a little bit and sort of see it from your eyes? 

00:09:45
FRANCES VAUGHAN All right! Well, I like to use the image of concentric circles. 

00:09:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:09:50
FRANCES VAUGHAN Because I think that as we become more conscious and more aware of the nature of the self, the sense of self expands, so that when we're afraid or when we're unwilling to be in touch with the world around us, our sense of self gets constricted and smaller. So, first of all, I see it in a developmental framework. 

00:10:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:10:15
FRANCES VAUGHAN I see that we are… are usually primarily identified with the body, the physical self. 

00:10:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:10:20
FRANCES VAUGHAN Then we also become aware of our feelings. We get a sense of the emotional self, the mental self, our thoughts about feelings. 

00:10:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:10:30
FRANCES VAUGHAN We even start to think about thinking at a certain stage. 

00:10:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So the… the first three layers be physical, emotional, and mental. 

00:10:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN Right! And those have been mapped by Western psychology… 

00:10:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:10:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN …very thoroughly. The areas that haven't been mapped so clearly are the ones that go beyond ego. 

00:10:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:10:45
FRANCES VAUGHAN That is, the… the ego is generally referred to as that what we think we are. 

00:10:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:10:50
FRANCES VAUGHAN The… The ideas about our identity in terms of roles and relationships and… 

00:10:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… The mask or the persona. 

00:11:00
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes, that's part of it. 

00:11:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:11:00
FRANCES VAUGHAN And then the existential self is what we generally get in touch with when we become concerned about authenticity… 

00:11:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So that's… 

00:11:10
FRANCES VAUGHAN …when it's not enough to have a good image. 

00:11:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:11:15
FRANCES VAUGHAN Or to play a role, but it really matters if you feel that you're authentic. 

00:11:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:11:20
FRANCES VAUGHAN A sense of integrity, a sense of choice, a sense of having your inner experience match your outer expression, so that there isn't that split between the two. 

00:11:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:11:30
FRANCES VAUGHAN This would be a… a sense of a healthy existential self. 

00:11:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And a good deal of contemporary psychology begins and ends right there, I suppose? 

00:11:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN Oh yes! And I have great appreciation for the contribution of the existential psychologists, such as Rollo May, James Bugental and some of the people who have really pointed out the… the importance of coming to terms with the existential issues of value, meaning, and purpose in our lives. 

00:11:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:11:55
FRANCES VAUGHAN And so… Then there's a another area though, because with the existential view, we're only isolated, individual, separate entities in the world, existing usually in a state of alienation in our lives. 

00:12:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It reminds me of Camus famous book Nausea, I think or was Sartre? 

00:12:15
FRANCES VAUGHAN No, that was Sartre. Yes! 

00:12:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay! 

00:12:15
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes! But both Camus and… and Sartre are certainly gave us a good exposure to that point of view. 

00:12:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Camu and… and Sartre and Genet the… the… the sense one gets from these existential writers is that when you really get in touch with life… 

00:12:30
FRANCES VAUGHAN Hmm…hmm… 

00:12:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …as it is, it will make you sick. 

00:12:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN Well, and because the… the ultimate reality there is the idea that we're separated and alone. 

00:12:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:12:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN However, it seems to me that there's another side to experience which is just as valid, which is that we're all connected. And that, yes, we have the experience of being separate… 

00:12:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:12:50
FRANCES VAUGHAN …and alone, but we also have the experience of being connected to each other, to the environment and that we’re not just independent, we’re also interdependent. 

00:13:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:13:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN So that as soon as we start recognizing how we all exist in this intricate network of mutually interdependent relationships, then I think that we wake up to the possibility of another kind of awareness that transcends the existential separateness. 

00:13:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So, we're moving beyond the existential here into… 

00:13:20
FRANCES VAUGHAN This is… 

00:13:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I would… I would think of this is sort of a systems approach. 

00:13:25
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes! 

00:13:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We're beginning to look at networking or… 

00:13:25
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes, exactly! 

00:13:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:13:30
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yeah! 

00:13:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Seeing human beings as… as like analogous to cells of the body. 

00:13:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes! 

00:13:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The social structure could be thought of as like a body. 

00:13:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes! 

00:13:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In that sense, but it's also transpersonal. 

00:13:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN It is, and it's what Ken Wilber has called vision logic, which is looking not only at ideas and how beliefs affect experience, but also at networks of ideas, and how we become more creative in terms of the way we view ourselves and the planet as a whole. It's a more global view, if you will. 

00:14:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:14:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN Which tries to take into account not only the individual in isolation, but also in relationship to the larger whole, both in relationship to the society as well as in relationship to the environment. 

00:14:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now Frances, you're an expert on intuition. You've written a book on intuition. When we get beyond the existential self, the agony and the loneliness, what I’m thinking of the creative process. How many artists do we hear about who struggle and they experience this alienation, and then they have this breakthrough, and what comes out of it is, you know, the music of Mozart or Wagner. 

00:14:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes! 

00:14:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The… You know, the great creativity. Now, that's not the same as… as what we've described as… as this networking phenomenon of people. That's a different level also, isn't it? 

00:14:50
FRANCES VAUGHAN It is a different level, and I think that intuition is often associated with inspiration… 

00:14:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:14:55
FRANCES VAUGHAN …and insight. And again, it's… it's a kind of self-transcendence. 

00:15:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:15:00
FRANCES VAUGHAN In that something seems to come through us rather than being a product of something that the ego invents. 

00:15:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:15:10
FRANCES VAUGHAN In other words, once we learn to be quiet, to quiet the mind, and this is where we can learn something from some of the Eastern disciplines, is that learning to quiet the mind opens up all kinds of creative possibilities. And that seems to be something that psychology needs to investigate, I think, in more depth. 

00:15:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:15:25
FRANCES VAUGHAN And also that what we believe to be true about this process tends to become true in our experience. 

00:15:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We create our own psychology. 

00:15:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN Well, we certainly have create our own inner experience by our beliefs about it. 

00:15:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:15:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN So I think that it's an appropriate task for psychology to investigate these experiences and to understand more the role of beliefs in generating our experience and also in terms of what it means for psychological health. 

00:16:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… How do you define the term transpersonal? I think we were kind of getting at it, and… and I've added this dimension we’ve discussed intuition, creativity, and the sense that there's a… a larger part of us that's not totally separate, that we're connected with other people. 

00:16:15
FRANCES VAUGHAN Hmm…hmm… 

00:16:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Am I missing something? 

00:16:20
FRANCES VAUGHAN Well, sometimes we… literally we say transpersonal means beyond the personal. 

00:16:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:16:25
FRANCES VAUGHAN But it also, I think, refers to the transcendental as expressed in and through the personal. 

00:16:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:16:30
FRANCES VAUGHAN So that it's the link between the personal and that which is transcendent. And again, it's a psychological view of spiritual development rather than a religious point of view, so the transpersonal psychology doesn't espouse any particular religious orientation, but it tries to understand the universal human experience that leads to different paths of exploration. 

00:16:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The Transpersonal psychologists have been accused, say by the existentialists such as Rollo May, of being advocates of religion and not practicing psychology at all. 

00:17:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN Hmm…hmm… Hmm…hmm… 

00:17:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But you know when your clients come to you and they meditate in a full lotus posture that you should really be wearing orange robes or something instead of a business suit. How… How do you respond to that? 

00:17:15
FRANCES VAUGHAN Well, that's not my experience at all. 

00:17:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:17:20
FRANCES VAUGHAN That as the way I see it and I've certainly had opportunity to talk to a lot of transpersonal psychologists, actually all over the world. And they are indeed psychologists and some of them have a religious… particular religious affiliation and some do not. But I don't know that any of them would try to convert anybody or impose their beliefs on their clients. 

00:17:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:17:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN If the… the functioning or working as a psychologist means, I think, maintaining a certain objectivity or if you will or at least putting the client's interests ahead of your own… 

00:17:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:17:55
FRANCES VAUGHAN …whatever your beliefs may be. 

00:17:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Were there's this enormous movement in modern, so-called modern psychology that is everything we do as psychologists must be scientific, it should be researched, it should be experimented. 

00:18:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN Hmm…hmm… 

00:18:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And we should always never go beyond the bounds of what the experiments say as the scientific psychologists. And yet, as I read your writing and the writing of other transpersonal psychologists… 

00:18:15
FRANCES VAUGHAN Hmm…hmm… 

00:18:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE  …the sense is that the science that you're looking to is not experimental science, it's the accumulated wisdom of people who have practiced meditation and spiritual disciplines and have reported phenomenological on that. 

00:18:30
FRANCES VAUGHAN Hmm…hmm… Well, I think that we do need more investigation. 

00:18:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah…ah… 

00:18:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN I think that more research would be an excellent contribution to the field that in fact that's something that… where there's a lot of work to be done yet. But, in fact, there's considerable data to say that there are methods of training awareness, of training the mind, that have worked very well in other cultures, that we could learn something… something from. 

00:19:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… It's almost as if I could describe you in a way as a psychologist’s psychologist. I mean, for people who have kind of mastered the Western traditions the scientific literature. 

00:19:10
FRANCES VAUGHAN Hmm…hmm… 

00:19:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The existential, the social, the… all the issues of alcoholism and child abuse and now they're looking for something more in their lives. They begin to wonder about the spiritual dimension, and yet many people in… in the modern world can’t really… religion is unpalatable… 

00:19:25
FRANCES VAUGHAN Hmm…hmm… 

00:19:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …to them. So do you sort of serve as a substitute priest in that sense? 

00:19:30
FRANCES VAUGHAN In a sense perhaps that's so, because I think it's too bad that if a person doesn't feel comfortable with conventional religion, that they should not have the opportunity to do the inner work and to find out for themselves their own connections to that inner source of wisdom or that sense of relatedness. It may or may not be a sense of connection to God. It depends. Some… Some religious traditions such as the Zen Buddhist for example, are not theistic at all. But nevertheless, they have a lot to contribute to spiritual development. 

00:20:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:20:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN And to values in the… in one's life. 

00:20:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It’s… It’s almost as if I recall reading a Carl Sagan novel recently. And he… he describes the Buddhist practice as saying the Buddhist God is so great he doesn't even need to exist. 

00:20:20
FRANCES VAUGHAN Well, I think we get into a… a question of semantics. 

00:20:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:20:25
FRANCES VAUGHAN Whether we talk about God or no God. It’s the same thing happens in psychological language, talking about the self and no self. And we do sometimes have experiences of oneness… 

00:20:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:20:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN …which might be called experiences of the one self. 

00:20:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:20:45
FRANCES VAUGHAN And sometimes we have experiences of the void which are… might be called experiences of no self. 

00:20:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:20:50
FRANCES VAUGHAN So, I think that we need to be careful not to get too bogged down in oppositional language when it… because I think we are talking about a universal experience. 

00:21:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:21:00
FRANCES VAUGHAN Or the potentiality for it anyway. 

00:21:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And in your work you've had a chance to study the phenomenological, personal, autobiographical reports of mystics of many different religions, and… 

00:21:10
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes! 

00:21:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …you've come… you've come to realize similar patterns, I think. 

00:21:15
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes, I think there are certainly universal experiences. 

00:21:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:21:20
FRANCES VAUGHAN And I always like to look for the transcendental unity of religions, that from a psychological perspective I sort of take the psychological viewing frame. It’s as though seems to me that we… we can't not take some type of viewing frame if we're gonna say anything at all. 

00:21:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:21:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN So we need to speak in a particular language, and as soon as we say anything we're already taking a position. 

00:21:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:21:45
FRANCES VAUGHAN And It seems to me that psychological language offers a way of exploration and investigation that is not already kind of predetermined by a long tradition of particular religious views. 

00:22:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know, one of the most intriguing areas in the interface between spirituality and psychology is the notion of kundalini that… 

00:22:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN Hmm…hmm… 

00:22:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …perhaps some people who we would define in our traditional Western sense as going crazy, having a nervous breakdown or a psychotic break or becoming schizophrenic, from another perspective they may be experiencing a spiritual awakening, a spiritual breakthrough. 

00:22:20
FRANCES VAUGHAN Hmm…hmm… 

00:22:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Is this part of what you deal within your practice? 

00:22:25
FRANCES VAUGHAN Well, I think the real issue here is to say, what happens when you have an experience that you don't… can't account for in terms of ordinary psychology… 

00:22:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:22:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN …if you will. And I think that there are… there are two possible hazards here. One is to pathologize experiences that might in fact be an opportunity for a larger, expanded sense of self. 

00:22:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Because they have these categories in the Diagnostic and Statistical manual for psychologists… 

00:22:55
FRANCES VAUGHAN Right! 

00:22:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …which say, you know, if… if you can't think of anything else, it's some form of undifferentiated schizophrenia. 

00:23:00
FRANCES VAUGHAN Right! And I don't think that's always true. 

00:23:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:23:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN But on the other hand I think that… that on the other side, there's also the hazard of romanticizing all experiences that are in some way the dissolu… involving the dissolution of ego boundaries as being breakthroughs or transpersonal… 

00:23:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE God intoxication. 

00:23:15
FRANCES VAUGHAN …nothing that there… Yes, and I think that there are both kinds. 

00:23:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:23:20
FRANCES VAUGHAN There are breakdowns and there are breakthroughs. 

00:23:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:23:25
FRANCES VAUGHAN And that as psychologists we need to know the difference. 

00:23:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE How do you do that? 

00:23:30
FRANCES VAUGHAN Well, there are certain… definitely certain characteristics that are typical. 

00:23:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:23:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN Say of pre-personal experiences and characteristics typical of transpersonal experiences. 

00:23:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:23:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN The pre-personal, for example, are generally regressive and they are… they generally have a lot of fear associated with them, and there's the sense of the reality that's perceived at the moment seems to be the only reality, the only possible reality. 

00:24:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And you use… 

00:24:00
FRANCES VAUGHAN And there's a kind of constriction of consciousness. 

00:24:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You use the term pre-personal? 

00:24:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes! 

00:24:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE What does that mean? 

00:24:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN Well, when we talk about, when we take a developmental frame. 

00:24:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes! 

00:24:10
FRANCES VAUGHAN We talk about pre-personal development that's before you've become fully self aware of your own ego identity. 

00:24:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah…ah… 

00:24:15
FRANCES VAUGHAN And we talk about personal. 

00:24:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes! 

00:24:20
FRANCES VAUGHAN And then transpersonal. 

00:24:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay! 

00:24:20
FRANCES VAUGHAN So that I think one of the confusions is… 

00:24:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… In other words a pre-personal… 

00:24:25
FRANCES VAUGHAN …between the pre and trans. 

00:24:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE …kind of break would be one where I'm… I'm really regressing back to say when I was eight years old, because something incomplete occurred at that time that I have to go back to. 

00:24:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes! 

00:24:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And… And that's not the same as a real spiritual breakthrough. 

00:24:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN No! 

00:24:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Okay! 

00:24:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN That's… That's trouble. 

00:24:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:24:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN There’s a confusion between the two, I think. 

00:24:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:24:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN And that's probably a very important area that needs further documentation and investigation so that it can be clarified, but I think we were really on the way to doing that. 

00:24:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… Now, in the transpersonal area, though, sometimes I should think it be hard to tell. I… I've read a book by an Eastern guru Meher Baba and she talks about the mad Musts or God-intoxicated people, they can't tie their shoelaces. 

00:25:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN Hmm…hmm… 

00:25:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE They can't dress themselves and they have their disciples, they come and feed them. And the disciples somehow recognize these people are very holy, their consciousness is lost in God. But to another person they might seem to be so severely retarded. 

00:25:20
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yeah! Well, I think that that's… I think we need to take the cultural differences into account here. 

00:25:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… Yeah! 

00:25:25
FRANCES VAUGHAN And that when we're talking about a developmental approach, we're looking at expanding consciousness in a way into higher states. Now, we differentiate higher states from altered states. 

00:25:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah…ah… 

00:25:35
FRANCES VAUGHAN Because altered states are simply other states other than our ordinary waking state. 

00:25:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:25:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN And that might be include this God intoxication that you're talking about. Higher states include all of the states… all of the faculties of the ordinary waking state plus additional… 

00:25:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:26:00
FRANCES VAUGHAN …faculties, so that they have a no attic(ph) quality, that means that there's a sense of deeper knowing and understanding. 

00:26:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yeah! 

00:26:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN And they also have… usually have the affect is one of loving kindness. 

00:26:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:26:15
FRANCES VAUGHAN And the motivation that comes out of these experiences tends to be one of service in the world. 

00:26:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And what you seem to be saying, Frances, is that people who are experiencing these higher states have integrated the transpersonal level into their lives, and… and they're really functioning with… what comes to mind the someone like Helen Keller. They're more than just average or normal, they're able to inspire other people and motivate and… and share peop… with people a… a sense of enthusiasm. 

00:26:40
FRANCES VAUGHAN Hmm…hmm… Yes! 

00:26:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… 

00:26:45
FRANCES VAUGHAN I think that's true, but I also think that it's available to all of us. 

00:26:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Ah…ah… 

00:26:45
FRANCES VAUGHAN And that we all have moments, if not days and times, when we tap into these states. And so I think that that's what we need to remember that we all have access to that source of transcendent wisdom within ourselves, if we're willing to take the time and give it the attention that it deserves. 

00:27:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE To recognize those moments? 

00:27:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes! 

00:27:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE To catch that spark? 

00:27:05
FRANCES VAUGHAN Yes! 

00:27:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, Frances, it's been a… a pleasure sharing that transpersonal spark with you. Thank you very much for being here. 

00:27:15
FRANCES VAUGHAN Thank you! It's been a pleasure for me too. 

00:27:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hmm…hmm… And thank you very much for being with us also.
