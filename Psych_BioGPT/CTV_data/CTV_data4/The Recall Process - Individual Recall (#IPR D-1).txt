We are grateful to the many people who gave of themselves in the hope that we might ultimately effect improvements in human interactions. All participants gave their informed consent, nonetheless, all material in these films must be regarded as if the information had been presented to each viewer personally, privately and in confidence. Dr. Henya Kagan (Klein) 

00:00:00
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  The core of this human interaction program is the recall process. In fact, it is this process for which the entire program has been named, "Interpersonal Process Recall" or "IPR". 

00:01:05
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) This method has been continuously evaluated and refined since 1961 when it was first designed at Michigan State University. Essentially, Dr. Kagan developed the recall process by audio or video taping in interaction between people and then inviting them to view a playback of that audio or videotape immediately or soon after the session. As they watched the tape, they are encouraged to recall any thoughts or feelings they were experiencing during the session. Each participant is encouraged to stop the tape whenever anything is recalled. The person who reviews the tape was the participants serves not as a critique or evaluator but rather as an inquirer and facilitator, an interested listener. 

00:01:55
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) With the IPR method, most people are able to study their own inter-processes to learn more about themselves and to improve their interpersonal interactions. To understand the recall process and IPR better, we urge you to view and discuss the demonstration tapes made of candid interactions. As you will see, there are several different ways of experiencing the recall process. The first of this is called, "Individual Recall." In Individual Recall, only one member of the recorded session is present, with the inquirer. In this unit, we will show you excerpts from those recall sessions selected by your instructor. The film you are about to watch is an initial session between a client and a psychotherapist. The interview portion is shown separately elsewhere in this program. Only the recall session of the therapist is presented here. By the way, at the time this tape was made, the therapist was the director of a Clinical Psychology Graduate Program at a major university. The inquirer was a graduate student. When using the IPR model, you do not have to know more than or be more experienced than the person you do recall with in order to provide that person was a useful learning experience. We think you will find the psychotherapist recall fascinating. In addition to the many things you will observe, you also might consider the following: How could this process be valuable or instructive for the psychologist? What is the inquirer probably learning, whether one's goal is to become a skill psychotherapist or simply more effective in one's interpersonal relationships? How could a person improve her or his competencies through this process? 

00:03:55
Recall Session: Psychologist 

00:03:55
  Review the session that you just had and ah, as you look at it, for you to recall, it will stimulate your own memory of thoughts and feelings, expectations that you had as you were in the interview. As you know that what you actually say and do is sort of like, the, the tip of an iceberg and underneath that is a lot of information that you're either processing... (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
DOZIER THORNTON Uh hmm. 

00:04:25
 ...or semi-processing. What we'd like to do now is get in touch with ah, as much of that as we possibly can. So what we're looking for is, uhm, quantity here, everything that you remember and whether you regard it as relevant or il, irrelevant at that time. (crosstalk) 

00:04:45
DOZIER THORNTON Uh hmm. 

00:04:45
 We'd like to, now, pick up, remember, and make fully aware and explore a bit. 

00:04:50
DOZIER THORNTON Okay. 

00:04:50
 You like to start the tape? And here again, just stop it by pushing the button as many times as you want, and as often as you can. 

00:05:00
DOZIER THORNTON Uh hmm. 

00:05:00
JOHN  Uhm, I, I told you how that brother was in the National Guard. 

00:05:10
DOZIER THORNTON Yes. 

00:05:10
JOHN Christian, he wouldn't drink, smoke or swear. 

00:05:10
DOZIER THORNTON Uh hmm. 

00:05:10
JOHN  Then he beat up those men. Then after he got out of the National Guard, a few years later, he took up drinking and then he, he gave up religion but my ma has loved. 

00:05:25
DOZIER THORNTON  Here I talked with him briefly in the waiting room. And here, ah, to me he seemed to be locked in on the past. And as I heard him start out this way, I, ah, in a sense felt that kind of sinking feeling because I thought as we had talked outside that he was willing to move on to something more current, but, ah, he started in at the same place. So one of my concerns was how can I get him to see that there's nothing he can do about what's happened in the past. He can only begin here and move from this point. So as he was saying that I was kinda listening to him with one ear and also, ah, trying to think of a way to get him to move to the here and now... (crosstalk) 

00:06:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:06:20
DOZIER THORNTON ...focus and to, to abandon this comparison between himself and his brother and really, ah, judging himself on the basis of the way his mother had, ah, responded to him and his brother. 

00:06:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:06:35
JOHN And the ground he walks on, but with me she has condemned me, condemned. 

00:06:40
DOZIER THORNTON Now, here as he was saying that that she worshipped the ground that he walked on. One hypothesis I had, and I started to, to ask him but I decided not to interrupt this flow, was that this guy probably didn't smoke, drink, screw, do anything else. He was really a good boy. 

00:07:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:07:00
DOZIER THORNTON And, ah, I also, at this point, had the hypothesis that he probably live alone. And, ah, again was tempted to interrupt him and checked that out but decided that I wouldn't that that would get me off track... (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:07:15
DOZIER THORNTON ...that it was really more for my own pleasure in verifying a hypothesis that I had rather than helping him move so I decided not to ask him. 

00:07:25
 How are you feeling towards him at this point? 

00:07:30
DOZIER THORNTON At this point, I was feeling somewhat, ah, like, ah, oh, that I wasn't gonna be able to get very far with him, that I had hoped and really believed that I could say something to him that could be helpful to him in this brief period of time. And at this point, I was beginning to abandon that somewhat even though I was still thinking about how I might try to help him. 

00:08:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:08:00
DOZIER THORNTON I wasn't sure that he would hear it. 

00:08:05
 Uh hmm. How are you feeling, ah, about him as you have this kind of wondering? (crosstalk) 

00:08:10
DOZIER THORNTON Well, I, I'll, I like him. Ah, when I first met him, I had very little positive feeling toward him. And as we talked, I came to feel the greater warmth, ah, toward him. And I, I was feeling warmly toward him here but more like, I wasn't going to be very affective one as affective as I would like to be. 

00:08:35
JOHN  Well, I guess... (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
DOZIER THORNTON How does that affect you? 

00:08:40
JOHN ...I guess it, it gets me the feeling that others reject me. 

00:08:40
DOZIER THORNTON Uh hmm. 

00:08:40
JOHN  So as I just said a minute ago, when, when a friend calls me on the telephone I'm, I'm so thrilled, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:08:45
DOZIER THORNTON Uh hmm. 

00:08:45
JOHN  to think someone, ah, takes an interest in calling long distance for 20 minutes or thereabout. 

00:08:50
DOZIER THORNTON  So you kind of expect that no matter what you do in the world, people aren't going to give you the affection and the love and attention that you'd like to have? 

00:09:00
JOHN That has been a thought of mine although my thought on that has been changing a little bit. (crosstalk) 

00:09:05
DOZIER THORNTON Oh. 

00:09:05
JOHN I've been looking at people as individuals instead of as a group, you know, I know each person has indiv. 

00:09:15
DOZIER THORNTON During that period, the thing I was trying to explore with him was, uhm, all the notion that, ah, because my mother lo, didn't love me, no one else ever really loved me. The other thing I thought I was sensing was a great deal of sadness in him, ah, later I asked about that and he said he wasn't feeling sad. Ah, and I was probably projecting a lot of my own feelings on to him as though, well, if I had memories of that kind, I think that's the way I would feel anytime...(crosstalk) 

00:09:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:09:55
DOZIER THORNTON ...I would begin to talk about that kind of situation. But, ah, that wasn't something that he was experiencing. 

00:10:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:10:00
DOZIER THORNTON  Ah, another thought that ah, made me wonder about that was it seemed as though he felt overlyjoyed if a friend were to call him or to initiate some contact with him. And that seemed a little too intense for me, ah. 

00:10:20
 In what sense? 

00:10:25
DOZIER THORNTON In the sense that it's the kind of joy where's people often cry, ah, someone does something good for him and they begin to weep, uhm, so happy and tears... (crosstalk) 

00:10:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:10:35
DOZIER THORNTON ...begin to flow. And often I think what that kind of thing is, is, represents both things, the feeling of joy but also the feeling of loss that I haven't experienced this as often as I would like and that, the two things would mix. And I had wanted to try to get to the other side of that for him to touch on the, the sadness. 

00:11:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:11:00
DOZIER THORNTON 'Coz I, I didn't feel that this is, that John had very often been in touch with tender, warm feelings. 

00:11:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:11:10
DOZIER THORNTON And for him to express sadness, I, I felt would be a freeing experience for him. 

00:11:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:11:15
JOHN And for a long while it's hard for me to believe. 

00:11:20
DOZIER THORNTON That someone could like you or would like you? 

00:11:20
JOHN  Ah, I'm lost here. 

00:11:25
DOZIER THORNTON  For a long time, it was hard for you to believe that someone would like you or could like you? 

00:11:30
JOHN  Yes. 

00:11:35
DOZIER THORNTON Uh hmm. 

00:11:35
DOZIER THORNTON  Now, here I was confused, uhm, after repeating that to him, ah, there seemed to be an impact on him. He seemed to get much more reflective but I felt a moment of loss, the sense of loss at that point because I, I didn't have any good clue as to what was going on with him. His. (crosstalk) 

00:12:05
 What was the loss? 

00:12:10
DOZIER THORNTON Ah, what's he, what is he doing with that? What impact do that have on him? 

00:12:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:12:15
DOZIER THORNTON Ah, he didn't hear it. I, I repeated it. He apparently heard it and agreed with it but it stopped him. And when work is stopped in that way and the person begins to reflect, I wonder... (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
DOZIER THORNTON ...what's going on, have I redirected, ah, his attention in a way that's not productive? 

00:12:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:12:35
DOZIER THORNTON  Uhm, has he moved into something that's, ah, gonna be very uncomfortable for him now to begin to... (crosstalk) 

00:12:45
 Yeah(ph). 

00:12:45
DOZIER THORNTON ...talk about? Have I, have I moved too, too rapidly? Have I sort of touched something that he feels, ah, exposed or naked, you know, he didn't want, ready to do that. 

00:13:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:13:00
DOZIER THORNTON So, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:13:00
 Were there a feeling, you know(ph), these are several different kind of hypothesis... (crosstalk) 

00:13:05
DOZIER THORNTON Yeah. 

00:13:05
 ...about the silence. Were, were there feelings of yours associated with those? 

00:13:10
DOZIER THORNTON Yeah, I felt, ah, a sense of, ah, some anxiety, some sense of, ah, I'm not sure what to call it but loss is what comes to my mind... (crosstalk) 

00:13:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:13:25
DOZIER THORNTON ...like I may have lost him the contact. 

00:13:25
 I see. 

00:13:25
DOZIER THORNTON And that... (crosstalk) 

00:13:30
 Hmm. 

00:13:30
DOZIER THORNTON ...felt almost alienating but not, I didn't feel like either of us was alienating the other but I wanted to reach out to him even more at this point. It was as though he had withdrawn for me and I felt we were beginning to come closer together. 

00:13:45
  Uh hmm. 

00:13:50
DOZIER THORNTON And, ah, well, I didn't wanna lose him... (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:13:50
DOZIER THORNTON  of the, the contact that I felt we were developing. 

00:13:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
DOZIER THORNTON Yeah, I used the word "anxious." It, it was like a momentary fear that I, I had lost touch. (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:14:00
DOZIER THORNTON  And ah, ah. 

00:14:05
 Is that something that you wanted to communicate to him? 

00:14:10
DOZIER THORNTON  No, not at that point. Uhm, not to him. 

00:14:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:14:20
DOZIER THORNTON I think if I had had that feeling with some other people, it, I could've just reached over and touched them for a moment and would've felt okay that there is some contact being made... (crosstalk) 

00:14:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:14:30
DOZIER THORNTON  here. (crosstalk) 

00:14:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:14:35
DOZIER THORNTON With John, I didn't feel that comfortable about touching him, uhm, and there isn't have a long enough contact with him to know how he would respond to that. 

00:14:50
[sil.] 

00:14:50
DOZIER THORNTON  I don't know, we're to go with that any further. (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
 Okay, that's fine. 

00:14:55
DOZIER THORNTON  Uh hmm. 

00:15:00
JOHN I've had a few friends for a number of years and that they're really good fiends. 

00:15:05
DOZIER THORNTON You seem to feel sad at this point. 

00:15:05
JOHN Do you see that or sense that or what? 

00:15:10
DOZIER THORNTON Yes. 

00:15:10
JOHN Sad, I'm not really sad. 

00:15:15
DOZIER THORNTON Uh hmm. 

00:15:15
JOHN This past week has been quite a pleasant one, the past two weeks. 

00:15:15
DONZIER THORNTON Okay. Here I felt a lot better. Ah, even though I was wrong, you know, I thought he was feeling sad and he said no, but the fact that he said no, ah, uhm, I could call that resistance or whatever, I'm more inclined to believe that, that that's exactly what he meant. And he wasn't feeling sad but we will back in touch and it's like, ah, even if we're disagreeing at least, ah, we're in contact with each other. 

00:15:45
  Uh hmm. 

00:15:50
DONZIER THORNTON So, I felt a great sense of relief here. 

00:15:50
 Uh hmm. How do you think he felt about you? 

00:15:55
DONZIER THORNTON At that point, I think he, what I was thinking then was that I was on target and that, that was shocking to him. This is all in my head. (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
 Fine. 

00:16:10
DONZIER THORNTON The, the notion that somebody had looked close enough to see that and he didn't want it acknowledged... (crosstalk) 

00:16:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:16:20
DONZIER THORNTON ...that anyone could read him in, in that way. 

00:16:20
  Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
DONZIER THORNTON Ah, I felt some sense of suspicion from him. 

00:16:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
DONZIER THORNTON Ah, if you can see things on me, tell me how you go about doing that so I can cover up even more. 

00:16:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:16:35
DONZIER THORNTON Ah, (coughs) those were my initial thoughts about that. And after he thought about it and he said no, and, ah, I accepted that but ah, even if he could say, "No, okay, we could go ahead and have a fight if we want to," but you know, we're still together. 

00:16:50
JOHN  Sad? Can't think of anything sad about them. 

00:16:55
DONZIER THORNTON Uh hmm. 

00:17:00
[sil.] 

00:17:00
DONZIER THORNTON  What are you thinking? 

00:17:10
DONZIER THORNTON  Okay, with his, with his sigh, ah, I felt that he, that this was an important part in, in our meeting. And that that may have been a turning point. The way I interpret it was that it, he felt safe now that... (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:17:30
DONZIER THORNTON ...I was not going to challenge him. 

00:17:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:17:35
DONZIER THORNTON That if he said the world is blue and I was gonna accept that and, and he could go on. And, ah, I felt some relief too when he saw it like, uhm. 

00:17:50
[sil.] 

00:17:50
DONZIER THORNTON  Well, like, like we overcome a barrier that, ah, okay, we're not gonna fight, ah, but we are gonna remain in contact. 

00:18:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:18:05
DONZIER THORNTON Now, here again he was silent for a brief period of time but I felt freer to go ahead and pursue that, you know, asking him what he was thinking. 'Coz I, I thought that now he knew that he could tell me whatever he was thinking or not and that I would accept that and that would be okay that he was in control. And that I wasn't gonna be telling him how he was feeling or what he should do. And, so I saw that as I kind of turning point. I also felt a lot freer at this point to, ah, well, to ask him, "What are you thinking?" To ask him any questions that I wanted to because I felt like he now, felt that he could say yes or no or whatever. I'm not sure how to go further with that but that seem to be a clear turning point. 

00:18:55
 Uh hmm, and, and how did you feel about yourself right then? 

00:19:00
DONZIER THORNTON I felt, I heard myself actually asking him, "What are you thinking?" and I became aware that I was feeling different at that moment, that I felt more comfortable and freer with him. And so I let it go ahead and flow out, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:19:15
  Uh hmm. 

00:19:20
DONZIER THORNTON You know, I was feeling good at that point. 

00:19:20
 Uh hmm, do you think he know, he knew then how you felt at some level? 

00:19:25
DONZIER THORNTON I, at some level, I think he knew that I also felt in control, that I also had a sense of confidence at this point. And, ah, so there was a non-written agreement that we can be mend here together. 

00:19:40
DONZIER THORNTON You seem to have a tremendous amount of anger toward her and you, you keep coming back to her as though she's done some unforgivable thing to you that you wanna get her for. 

00:19:55
JOHN She sure, ah, did and if I could use the dirty word I would. She screwed up my life. 

00:20:00
DONZIER THORNTON Okay, here's another change to me, initially, I didn't wanna go into this bid about his mother. 

00:20:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:20:05
DONZIER THORNTON And here, okay, he brings it up, again, I feel comfortable about, "Okay, what is it about your mother? Let's, let's talk about her?" 

00:20:15
 Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:20:15
DONZIER THORNTON Not without talking about him of course, I'd felt this was still on him but I, ah, I felt okay about getting back to that at this point. 

00:20:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:20:20
DONZIER THORNTON  Partly because I felt that we could, could talk about it differently. 

00:20:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:20:25
DONZIER THORNTON  And by differently, I mean, in a more here-now fashion, ah, more in terms of the impact that was having on him rather than just his anger toward her. 

00:20:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:20:40
DONZIER THORNTON And the things she did wrong. 

00:20:40
  Do you have any expectations of him at this point? 

00:20:45
DONZIER THORNTON  No, I don't feel like I have that I want him to go in any particular direction, you mean, anything like that. 

00:20:55
 Yeah, (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
DONZIER THORNTON No. 

00:20:55
 either in content or in process. 

00:20:55
DONZIER THORNTON  No, uh-uh, no, ah, the earlier segment I think was therapeutic for me too (laughs). Ah, 'coz it, it unhooked me from, ah, oh, ah, a preconceived, ah, direction that I, I think I was locked into. And, uhm, "We're not gonna talk about your mother," 

00:21:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:21:20
DONZIER THORNTON ...as I think where I started up. And, ah, here, yeah, we can talk about your mother. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:21:25
DONZIER THORNTON but I'm gonna suggest some ways to do that. And of course, he didn't have to follow those. 

00:21:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:21:30
DONZIER THORNTON But I think he was also more ready to hear suggestions that I have. 

00:21:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
JOHN You know. 

00:21:35
DONZIER THORNTON  John, what is it that keeps you locked into your mother? 

00:21:40
JOHN Brother, I can't get to that answer yet but I'm working on. 

00:21:45
DONZIER THORNTON Uh hmm. 

00:21:45
DONZIER THORNTON At this point, when he said "brother," I felt a sense of intimacy between us (laughs). The way he looked at me yet and said that. Ah, there was a moment during the sequence where I had a, a feeling like, uh-oh, he's going further and further into blaming and damning his mother again. And I told myself, "Well, wait and see." And so I just let that go on and it became clear that he wasn't really into the same kind of old talk that he had been into earlier blaming and damning his mother. 

00:22:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:22:25
DONZIER THORNTON So, I felt good about that and. (crosstalk) 

00:22:25
 That you had waited. 

00:22:30
DONZIER THORNTON Yes, that, (crosstalk) 

00:22:30
 Okay. Uh hmm. 

00:22:30
DONZIER THORNTON that I had waited, uh hmm. Uhm, I was trying to recall if I had any hypothesis about direction here, and I don't remember any. 

00:22:35
  Uh hmm. 

00:22:40
DONZIER THORNTON Ah, I was more into the, the data myself here and now what's going on with John and I at this point rather than, ah, I want to move from this point to point A by such and such a time. 

00:22:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:22:55
DONZIER THORNTON Ah, I wasn't doing that kind of thinking here. 

00:22:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:22:55
DONZIER THORNTON Uh hmm. 

00:22:55
  Ah, you mentioned that the brother had, had an impact... (crosstalk) 

00:23:00
DONZIER THORNTON Yeah. 

00:23:00
  on you. Can you take that a little bit further? 

00:23:05
DONZIER THORNTON Yeah, in the sense that I was feeling like he was moving away from a direction that he knew that I had hopefully would go into which was more the focus on him and the focus more on what's going on between us. 

00:23:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:23:20
DONZIER THORNTON And, hmm(ph), that when I asked the question, he is beginning that with brother and then the statement was a way of saying to me I thought, "I'm with you." 

00:23:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:23:30
DONZIER THORNTON  You know, I got off truck but I, I understand, we're still together. That was the way I interpreted that. 

00:23:40
 Hmm. 

00:23:40
JOHN Hmm, people were suppose to have nice relationships with their mothers, I didn't. 

00:23:45
DONZIER THORNTON Where, where did... (crosstalk) 

00:23:45
JOHN But(ph). 

00:23:45
DONZIER THORNTON ...you get that? 

00:23:45
DONZIER THORNTON  Here when he said people are suppose to have nice relationships with their mothers, I felt, okay, (laughs). Uhm, I felt in control, okay, he's beginning to give me some of the hypothesis that he lives by. And with that, I felt I can work. 

00:24:10
 All right, ah, can you take that, ah, feeling of control a little bit further? 

00:24:15
DONZIER THORNTON Yeah. 

00:24:15
 What that, ah, how you experienced that? 

00:24:15
DONZIER THORNTON  Yeah, this is some material that we can deal with. It, it's whether concrete and specific and we can talk about it. We can look at it from many different knowledge... (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:24:30
DONZIER THORNTON ...points. That's what I mean by control. 

00:24:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:24:30
DONZIER THORNTON That, ah, ah, this is an area where, that we can pursue and I think we can be productive then(ph), if we do that. 

00:24:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:24:40
DONZIER THORNTON And I know how to pursue that. I feel quite comfortable and confident about pursuing, ah, thinking problems of that kind, distortions of that kind. 

00:24:50
 Uh hmm. So part of the feeling of control for you is the, the sense of I have something to work on concrete than I know... (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
DONZIER THORNTON Yes. 

00:25:00
 ...what to do with it. 

00:25:00
DONZIER THORNTON Yes. Uh hmm, (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
 Uhm. 

00:25:00
DONZIER THORNTON you know. 

00:25:00
  Ah, what's that feeling like, do you, you, is it, uhm, I guess is there a body feeling that's associated with that? 

00:25:10
DONZIER THORNTON Oh, yeah, that there is a body feeling. Part of the body feeling, when I'm not feeling that sense of control, I feel more generally tight. I don't think he gets expressed very well in gross body movements. When I'm not feeling that, I, I feel, ah, specially in the gut part of me, ah, a sense of openness, a freeness. It's, is though, ah, if there were a little ball in there, ah. 

00:25:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:40
DONZIER THORNTON When I don't feel in control, it's being crashed... (crosstalk) 

00:25:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:40
DONZIER THORNTON  by the sides of my stomach or... (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
DONZIER THORNTON ...this whole area. And when I am feeling in control, it's like it can move freely not necessarily bouncing but it's ah, there's an open receptivity to whatever comes and, (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
  Uh hmm. 

00:26:00
DONZIER THORNTON uhm, and I, I was feeling that more here. Now, this doesn't take away from the earlier sense of freedom that I was talking about, that was more of the relationship kind of freedom. And this is more of the kind of cognitive freedom, ah, that I, I know this area and I will be able to think much clear here. 

00:26:20
  Uh hmm. Hmm. 

00:26:25
DONZIER THORNTON Ah, I haven't sufficient data that I can generate (laughs) a wider way of examples and other things to work for it. 

00:26:30
 Uh-huh. Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
JOHN  To really get her, ar, around and get along well in life. I have been told that, yes, by different people. 

00:26:40
DONZIER THORNTON You have to have a good relationship with your mother (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
JOHN Mother. (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
DONZIER THORNTON  in order to have a good relationship with me. 

00:26:45
JOHN Or other people, yes. 

00:26:45
DONZIER THORNTON  Explain to me how that follows. 

00:26:50
JOHN Hmm. Maybe I'd, maybe I misunderstood something. 

00:26:55
DONZIER THORNTON Okay, so(ph) to me I haven't thinking here. And if he's doing this kind of thinking, I think he's working and I think it would be the kind of work that he will not ignore tomorrow, next week, next year. My impression at, at this point was that one area that he may protect very much is a feeling area trying to hide feelings, keeping people from knowing anything about his feelings. And that maybe nobody had ever really confronted his thinking. And here, he kinda smiled as he's thinking was confronted. 

00:27:30
  Uh hmm. 

00:27:35
DONZIER THORNTON And I thought that smile was one of pleasure that someone regarded his thinking as important enough to, to check or have him checked. 

00:27:40
  Uh hmm. 

00:27:45
DONZIER THORNTON Like confirming that you have the ability to do this and take a look. Ah, so I thought he was feeling, ah, like I respected him to be able to do that and, ah, that I had something to offer. 

00:28:00
 Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:28:00
DONZIER THORNTON  I think the notion of respect with him is very important. And I think that increased in our relationship as we went through this. I'd love to hear a recall on him (laughs). 

00:28:15
JOHN I want a woman that doesn't drink or smoke. 

00:28:20
DONZIER THORNTON Uh hmm. 

00:28:20
JOHN Because I don't drink or smoke and I want my own kind. 

00:28:25
DONZIER THORNTON Hmm. 

00:28:25
JOHN It's almost an impossibility to do and then I feel uncomfortable. 

00:28:30
DONZIER THORNTON  Now, just one phrase in there, "I want my own kind" when he said that, I took that very personally like I smoke. He knows I smoke. 

00:28:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:28:45
DONZIER THORNTON And that he was putting distance between me and him, you know, he doesn't want anybody although he's talking about women. (crosstalk) 

00:28:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:28:50
DONZIER THORNTON He doesn't want anybody who smokes. Well, I'm a smoker. And so I had been feeling very close to him and that was increasing as we went through this up until that point. And I felt some distance. It didn't last very long but there is like I think pushed away a little bit. 

00:29:10
DONZIER THORNTON Yeah. You, you see that in some ways, your own development as a child was retarded compared to many people in our culture. 

00:29:20
JOHN Right. 

00:29:20
DONZIER THORNTON But at the same time, you're out there trying, now your trying to make up for the lost time. 

00:29:25
JOHN Yeah, yeah, yeah and I'm feeling a lot happier this way too. 

00:29:25
DONZIER THORNTON Uh-huh. That's fine. Yeah. 

00:29:30
DONZIER THORNTON I had no idea of how much or often he had ever received praise and he wanted to thank him or complimented him. And, ah, I think he wants it and he received it very well. 

00:29:45
 Hmm. 

00:29:45
DONZIER THORNTON Ah, but I, I felt very pleased that I attended carefully enough to go ahead and acknowledge that as a real achievement. 

00:29:55
DONZIER THORNTON  That, that seems to be more freeing. I can see it. (crosstalk) 

00:30:05
JOHN Yes, I feel like jaywalking now (laughs). 

00:30:05
DONZIER THORNTON All right. 

00:30:05
DONZIER THORNTON Well, when he said, ah, he feels like jaywalking now, again, I felt our greater sense of closeness in part because he's talking about violating the law. I don't know when anybody in this area has been ticketed for jaywalking but still, you know, you're encouraged not to jaywalk. 

00:30:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:30:25
DONZIER THORNTON And, ah, this guy it seems to me has lived so closely by the law and the rules, uhm, but here he's feeling good enough or to acknowledge that "Hey, I might even stretch some of the rules a bit." 

00:30:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:30:40
DONZIER THORNTON  And, ah, that felt good. (crosstalk) 

00:30:45
 The, the impact of that on you. 

00:30:45
DONZIER THORNTON  Ah, I, I felt happy with him. Ah, I don't know it ju, just felt good. It was a good, freeing feeling too. 

00:31:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:31:00
DONZIER THORNTON And that we had shared that. 

00:31:00
  Uh hmm. 

00:31:05
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) Do you see how this process can be valuable where any of the hunches that you had about the interview confirmed by the recall? 

00:31:15
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) Notice that even though Dr. Thornton is a highly competent psychologist with many years of experience, he was clearly invested in the session, he wasn't cool or detached. He really was genuinely concern about the client and visibly uncomfortable when he thought that he might not be able to be of help. Do you suppose that emotional investment in the interaction by the therapist or helper may be an essential ingredient in the helping process? Some of the other aspect Dr. Kagan found intriguing about Dr. Thornton's recall were: How pleased he was when the client felt strong enough to disagree with him because that meant that the client now felt the sense of control and power in the situation. Also interesting was his comment about why people cry when something good happens to them, that they may be getting in touch with how often this has not happened to them in the past? Fascinating too was the fact that he had some guesses about the client but chose not to test them because that would have been for his own curiosity and not for the benefit of the client. Did you notice the positive look on Dr. Thornton's face when he spoke of how he would have normally reached over and touched some clients to make contact but he felt uncomfortable doing so with John. What do you suppose it to mean when you avoid doing something that you would ordinarily do? Wouldn't it make you wonder what was different about this interaction? He looked as if he were asking himself those same questions. And what about the inquirer? What kind of learning do you think she was experiencing? 

00:33:00
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  There are many aspects we could focus on in this interview. However, the most important point at this time is for you to see how both participants can learn and benefit from the recall process and to begin understanding how this process could be useful to you.
