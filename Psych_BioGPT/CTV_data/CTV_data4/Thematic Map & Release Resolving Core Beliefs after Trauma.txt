ANNA B BARANOWSKY Yes, I am delighted. Thank you so much for the invitation. I'm really, really excited to be able to talk about this particular, uh… approach that we've been using, we've been having great result with it. And, for, for anybody who has heard me speak or, or understand some of the work that I do, uh… all that work that I do is really embedded in a model, a tri-phasic model. So I'm actually going to continue with exactly that focus. But, you know, really what we've developed is something called Thematic Map and Release and it's really all about resolving core beliefs after trauma. And, you know, I, I actually really love that they have included criterion D in the new diagnostic criterion 4 PTSD and that's, you know, something that I'm gonna refer back to throughout uh… the presentation today. And uh… of course trying to give you a better understanding of how thematic map and release fits within our treatment, our trauma practice approach in general, uh… as well as covering the actual intervention. So we have a couple of different materials that are available for people who want more detailed information after. So just be aware that I'm not gonna give you everything right now but these in, the materials you need to be able to use the, the exercise will be available to you. So, umm… I want to thank Carol, and Jane, and Karin for helping to coordinate and put this together, so that I can share this information with all of you and have some time to talk about this, this issue. So what I wanna do to start with is just look at this idea of how Thematic Map fits into a Tri-Phasic model. Now Tri-Phasic model is really based largely on Herman seminal work, her, her book, uh… in 1992. But really our trauma practice, tools for stabilization and recovery which is now it's, in its third edition is a Tri-Phasic model. It was based on, on Judith Herman's, uh… Tri-Phasic model because we found that it was so important not to just take a approach and use it piecemeal but you embedded into an approach that allows first for individual to have a good grasp of stabilization book, we're moving into any exercises that help them to work through trauma and thematic map and release is a phase 2 exercise. And then finally when we get to phase 3, we're really pulling everything together and helping people move back into a meaningful life. I want to just talk about, why it's so important to think about adverse childhood experiences and really just adverse experiences through the life span because in terms of thematic map and release, we're talking about a lifetime of events that have us look at our life in a very specific way. So we've had a lot of events in which we've see that people can be cruel, we start to believe that life is cruel or we can't trust people. So we start to look at our lives through a certain lens and even go on a hunting expedition for reasons to believe that life is a certain way. And we know that when people experience many adverse childhood experiences and, you know, we know that the ACE, uh… studies suggest that, umm… those that experience four or more had increased risk of depression, uh… chronic diseases, uh… suicidality, lung disease. And they are much more at risk of believing certain negative things about their lives. And, so, you know, I think everybody has experienced this in their practice, who's been seeing uh… patients directly, that sometime you can work on trauma memories and they'll still be suffering and struggling with the negative beliefs. So when I tell you a little bit about my perspective of this work in my Confessions of a Trauma Therapist, recognizing that I'm exactly like my patients. In that I'm also shaped, by what? I experience in sea. And in order for me to do well in my work after, it's actually more than 20years of doing trauma work. I have to know what keeps me going. And a lot of what keeps me going is seeing that my work is making a difference with my clients. Uh… One of the things that I am very much involved with is the online portal of the Traumatology Institute. We offer courses right around the globe, 42 different countries. And one of the very interesting things that, uh… we do when somebody takes the clinical traumatologist or the community work place, traumatology stream in our online programs is everybody has to complete a genogram. They could either do it of somebody that they know, uh… a family member, a client or themselves. And it's so interesting because the large number of people who take these courses, choose to do a genogram of their own personal history, that they are getting the opportunity to look from the inside at what are those experiences that have shaped them. And I think this is really important because here's where the negative beliefs come. Because when we have, uh… a large number of experiences and they seem to keep repeating themes or beliefs, is hard to shake those. And if we don't understand what our own themes are from the perspective of being a trauma therapist, we can also get stuck in negative beliefs. So, you know, I think the implications are pretty enormous because what I found is, from people who submit their genograms, a 100% of those genograms turn into traumagrams, they are very significant trauma. And what that means is that the, the students who take programs with us and they are quite a large number of them. Large numbers have a history of trauma and I look at trauma has being the great human equalizer. Most of us have experienced something in the course of our lifetime or will or we know somebody who has and then we're working with trauma clients. And so it becomes very important for us to approach this with a deep sense of understanding of what happens when we look at our lives and the kind of beliefs that are formed. And what it means for the people that I work with, the students that I work with? It, it makes it pretty clear to me that unless we have approaches that get to the heart of. And one of the things that I am seeing at the heart off is, what beliefs do we have about the world around us and how rigid did those beliefs become? When they become rigid, we absolutely have to have real practical tools with that work and make a difference. Who is vulnerable? Umm… Now, because I work with such a abroad spectrum of trauma survivors, I mean everybody from the cameraman to the police officer, somebody who is in a car accident, somebody who grew up in a household where there was trauma, umm… so many different avenues can lead to these rigidly held negative beliefs. So I am less interested in who is vulnerable and much more interested in the pattern of beliefs that arise overtime. So here are a couple of examples I'm actually gonna focus on Peter, who is a paramedic. I work with a lot of uh… EMS, emergency services, police, RCMP, umm… that are (inaudible ). So let's talk about Peter. He was, umm… first on the call, uh… after an officer down event. And this is a incident in which an officer was harmed on the job. Uh… he responds. Now Peter comes from a huge history, uh… many years on a job, lots of exposure to numerous events. So he just assumes that he's okay, it seems like a normal response. Then unfortunately what ends up happening to Peter is, somehow this officer down event becomes embedded and he goes to the movies and he sees a chase scene and there is an officer down in the movie and he has a panic attack in the movie theatre and he is in just a state because he can't make the connection at the moment but this is a panic attack, despite all he knows, he goes to the hospital and, you know, he gets uh… you know, full work up and they say, you know, you're having a panic attack and this is anxiety related. And now he feels absolutely devastated. He feels like a weakling. He tells himself, he's worthless, he can't go back to work, he's a helper, he's not, he's not somebody who needs help, he, he just can't stand this new version of his reality, the fact that he's suffering. So we start to look at it from this whole perspective of the negative beliefs, uh… this is this negative belief, new criterion D expectations, self appraisal and mood. And the way its written is persistent trauma-related negative alterations, in cognitions and mood, beginning or worsening after traumatic event occurred, as evidence by one or more of the following states. Emotional negative states, fear, guilt, sadness, diminished interest in significant activities, socially withdrawn, reduced expression of positive emotions. So Peter is really struggling with criterion D after this event. And, you know, he kind of says with a lot of people, say time heals all wounds, but he's in extreme pain, he's just expecting it to go away. He really is actually demanding that it goes away on his own. He's frustrated with himself. We know that stress left unmanaged leads to all sorts of problems. And Peter is now stuck with a feeling, uh… really unwell most of the time. We know that from, uh… (inaudible ) work in the, the 30s that diseases of adaptation occur when there is no relief. So stresses ongoing too frequent, too intense, so Peter struggling, he's getting headaches, he's got chronic, uh… gastrointestinal problems. His symptoms are not getting better at all. And he's feeling like a very different man now, than he was. Now this make sense because what happens is, we only need one event to really embed and learn, learn something. This I actually hard wired, so that we can get away from danger. Unfortunately, you know, this onetime learning has left Peter absolutely in an extreme state. There was a research project uh… number of years ago, in which they were uh… rats on a maze and they put down either a liquid or food that was embedded with a, with a substance that made the rat ill. And so the rat going on the same maze after the rat recovers will never drink or eat from the same place again. It's one time learning embedding so that we, we stay safe, it makes sense. But from an evolutionary perspective, it's true that it helps us in a lot of ways to stay safe. But if we keep remembering over and over again and telling ourselves that this world is a dangerous place. Remember, if that's the theme and if that's Peter's theme, if this world is a dangerous place and everywhere I go, I tell myself that. Even when I am safe, I am gonna be absolutely exhausted. Problem is, is that, our mind is a storytelling machine that's wired to terrify us. And when we get these big dumps of adrenaline, we have a spike followed by a cortisol release. And the more adrenaline spikes, we have the longer cortisol lasts and the longer we stay in a highly agitated state thinking about these negative things. And so it actually starts to wire in a very powerful way, whatever our, our negative belief is. It starts to become hard wired in our brain. The more we think about something, the more we believe it, I think so it becomes a real powerful draw. I mean, we've, we've all experienced clients who get so, uh… strongly wired to believe a certain thing. This just doesn't seem to be able to pull themselves out of it, no matter what we say. And logical, rational conversations will not change that because the wiring is so powerful. So what's happening to Peter, it happens to all of us. And, you know, classical conditioning really, really helps us to understand that. This whole idea of the unconditioned stimulus, uh… which in the case have lost work, is meat powder, uh… and then a dog is exposed to meat powder, the dog drools, it's a normal response, that the unconditioned response. And then you pair that with a, uh… conditioned stimulus and this time it's a(inaudible ). So you're pairing the meat powder with a tone. And now the dog salivating, just listening to the tone. Well, with the officer down incident, it's the same thing. Peter had a real event, officer down. This was extremely stressful for Peter, then he goes to the movies and he sees an officer down, he's experiencing extreme panic to the condition stimulus and anything that is a remainder of the officer down. It doesn't have to be the officer down anymore, it could be just watching somebody, you know, be surprised or, you know, feeling that some how things are not going his way or going to the supermarket and somebody drops the can and he hears the bang. Whatever it is, it becomes related and he is looking at his life and saying, this world isn't safe. All these experiences start to link together and we start to be on a hunt for reasons to believe that this world is not safe. We're talking about Peter(inaudible ). So what we need to do is find a way to help Peter face that conditioned stimulus, the things that's really not dangerous with relaxation in order to get a new response. More relaxation and extinguishing of the fear respond. That could be pretty tricky. And we have to find pretty clever ways to get access to what's underneath the surface, the negative beliefs. Sometimes people don't even know what they, their negative belief is or the cognitive distortion, but we want to get access to it. So what we do is we try to get access to it. I wanna show you what we do. We want to get access to it by using a strategy of identifying negatively held fear, triggered responses, real events and then find the theme. But before we do that, and I'm gonna just be really clear. Whenever I present a new approach to clients, even when if I work with the client many, many times, I always explain the approach, confirm that they understand the approach, give time to ask questions, give consent and confirm that they can stop whenever they have needed. I always teach them exercises for safety and stabilization before I move them into any trauma processing work. Now Thematic Map and Release is a trauma processing work. I love using different breathing exercises. And, you know, there are number of exercises that we have either some of our videos that you can watch or, uh… some of our material. We have a breath trainer that you could either access through our YouTube video link. And if people want any of these resources, uh… we're happy to offer that to them. But you could just go to YouTube and type in 36 breathing and you'll see how we use our 36 breathing, or go to the App Store for Breathe 911. You can also get access to the first 10 days of our video stabilization program. Its part of our trauma recovery program, which is a, a self-guided, uh… trauma recovery approach. And people, if they are interested in, uh… those first 10 days free, you can get that at… whatisptsd.com (inaudible )find-com, so that is free and it is available to anybody who goes to the whatisptsd website. What I do to get access to the themes before I start thematic map, is I use the trigger list. And I am very, very clear about how I start the trigger list. What I really want is experiences that are representative of the difficult things, things they have not been able to get over and things they might call traumatic. I put some really clear guard reels around it, 7 to 10 words maximum, a timeline, when the thing happened or how old they were and a rating. So between 1 to 10, where one is not at all disturbing, 10 is the worst feelings of distress and any number in between. Intel, they identify. Let's say whatever is on their list. Let's say they have got five or seven, really significant events and they identify them like this. So I've got four here, umm… in this case, uh… this individual has had umm… four significant events occur. Umm… age ten, teased in school. Age 12, cornered by boys. Age 12, uh… parents came to house and listen, police, parents were silent. Uh… Age 27, shamed by a doctor. Now the themes are, I'm unacceptable, unlovable, rejected when people get to know me, people are cruel. So this is a very significant set of beliefs. Now I can work with this woman focusing on the themes or I can work with this person focusing on the memories alone. Problem with the memories is, there are times when we work on the memories alone and we can actually get to resolution on the memories, but this, the themes stay ignited and that's a big problem, because then they remain in pain and discomfort. And not able to access the content that is really disturbing to them. So before I get into, uh… the thematic map, I look at, uh… making sure that they are ready to do the trauma work. Resolving danger, making sure they understand the difference between being safe and feeling safe, self soothing, self rescue and practicing or demonstrating self rescue and then just negotiating or contracting for informed consent. This is really when we move into phase 2. Umm… and we get the opportunity to work with our clients directly on that, uh… working through trauma material. And we're getting access to the content that lays below the surface, the unconscious mind with thematic map, because you're no longer having a rational or direct conversation about the theme. You are trying to get access to it through a different stimulus. So some of the research on eye movements suggests that, we are searching for information served that stored in long-term memory when we're changing our visual focus. And that these eye movements facilitate thinking, memory, and other cognitive function. This is what I have noticed in, in working with my clients that when we deliberately hold these focus point, we seem to be able to access, uh… information historical traumas, old beliefs, feelings. It can we pretty profound because they might not be able to get so deeply uh… connected with what's happening to them, uh… based on the, the things that they say to themselves. So, if the deliberate hunt for thoughts, emotions and body sensations that go along with the theme that the individual is struggling with. Posted two video links and one of the video links that we have is a long one and one is a short one. And the nice thing about the video links is they take the, the long one takes you through an entire session with the client. The short video link actually just gives you, uh… a short form and uh… I always start, usually I will capture the theme in the previous session because there's not enough time to both capture the theme and uh… do a complete thematic map and release. Uh… Usually it will take me a full 50 minute, 50 or 45 minute to finish thematic map and release. I like to take my time and which, with each focus point, uh… we go through a script. Uh… There's nobody here on the line I believe, uh… other than, I think, James(ph) said that she's using the map, the trauma practice manual, the book that was released in January this year and it has the full script. But for people who are interested in the script uh… and the template for thematic map, that will be made available as well. So, now we're going to rate the theme once we have it. Explain thematic map and release. And I like to do all of this in the session before and get permission to use thematic map and release with my clients. I get all of that prior to the session where I am working with thematic map and release. The other thing that I have done is, I put together of, about a five minute video that gives uh… just a kind of short form of doing one of the focus points. So that if a client finds this exercise very helpful, I can give them the link and then they can just watch the video of that, so that they can harness this sensation for themselves. The other nice thing is, once I have done this, once with a client, if they come in and they have another theme, we can jump right into thematic map and release with the material. So here's thematic map and release, this is the, the template. Uh… This one is actually missing the lower, uh… two points. So we start with, uh… point one and you will see here that some for emotion, thoughts, and body sensations. And then here you will see GS, that's grains of sand, uh… and then below that is hands and body. And they are just cues to help uh… the practitioner, keep focused on the task at hands. So you would go with focus point one, then uh… below focus point two. It's below this one. You just can't see it on your screen. Then we go to the next one which is below six. Here up to four, then we go lateral five, six, and then straight ahead seven. Now the script, and I don't know how many people have had a chance to, uh… use this, uh… watch the script on, on the video. But when you do, you start to understand how powerful it is for a client going through the material. Uh… But as I said, we find the core theme and rate it. We get, explain the approach and gain permission. We practice the imagination. We test the first focus point and ask is it okay to continue and we'll repeat for each of the, the six points. Now I have added this link here. You'll see uh… psychink, ticlearn, thematic-map-release. If you want to get access to the, the, the scripts, the materials related, then just go to that link and you will be able to get access to it there. The next thing that I want to do is, I actually want to give you a brief overview of this and just walk you through the short form of just one focus point. 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN This is our release exercise. You think about this. 

00:26:20
ANNA B BARANOWSKY We have all been to some place where there's a sandy beach and you know what it seems like to have handful of warm sand? 

00:26:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:26:30
ANNA B BARANOWSKY You know that feeling? 

00:26:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:26:30
ANNA B BARANOWSKY You know how nice that is? 

00:26:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:26:35
ANNA B BARANOWSKY And then you also know the feeling of having that sand's spilling through your fingers and how nice that feels. 

00:26:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:26:40
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Can you just close your eyes for a minute and just imagine yourself doing that, and tell me when you have that? 

00:26:45
UNKNOWN I do. 

00:26:45
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Okay. So you can picture the feeling of the release that goes along with that. 

00:26:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:26:50
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Now the next piece of release is… I want you to imagine inside of yourself, that you're an empty vessel filling with sand from the top of your head and sand flows in like an hour glass slowly, filling up, going into the front and back of your face, down your neck into your shoulders, down your arms, into the core of the body, down your legs, (inaudible ) and calves into your feet. And when it gets to the tips of the toes and the tips of your fingers, I want you to actually picture that the sand is being released, just spilling out in the way from you. And tell me when you have that feeling. 

00:27:30
UNKNOWN I do. 

00:27:30
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Good. Okay. Now bring your awareness back into the room. 

00:27:35
UNKNOWN I do. 

00:27:35
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Yeah, absolutely. So now what I'm gonna have you do is, just notice all of that. I want you to harness your imagination, use your mind to harness that powerful imagination. Open up your hands and let them rest on your lap. And, I want you to picture that you got two large warmed heavy dry handfuls of sand and the sensation of the warmth miss deeply into the center of the palms of your hands and it feels soothing as it moves up your arms, and use your shoulders. I want you to get the sensation of that one being very comforting in the center of the palms of your hands. I want you to get the sensation of the grains of sand, its spilling through your slightly palmed fingers, just down in a room. Getting the sensation of release and just allow yourself to do that. And then focusing inside of yourself again using your mind to harness your imagination, picturing that you are an empty vessel filled in with sand from top of your head, the sand spills in, filling in slowing, moving into the front of that, the face down your neck into your shoulders, down your arms, into the core of your body, down unlocks through to the tips of your toes and tips of the finger tips. Just release it. Emotionally just allows yourself to picture that for the moment. I want you to get the sensation of all those thoughts, the emotions, and body sensations, the feeling of being cold, sensation of surprise, pressure, towards being at shock. But all of that attached to the grains of sand, which are carried down and away, spilling out to tips of the toes and finger tips and just allow yourself to have that sensation. Just do whatever you need to do. Your witness being compassionate observer to that storyline that you release. 

00:30:05
[sil.] 

00:30:15
ANNA B BARANOWSKY No one should bring your around a spark into the room and I want you to just notice what you are aware of. Just notice how you feel right now and allow yourself if you need to, to practice again to focus on releasing thoughts, emotions and body sensations as best as you can to help you get through your day. 

00:30:40
ANNA B BARANOWSKY And I just want to say that the resource for, uh… all those videos and the material are available. Uh… I just wanted you to get a sense of, umm… a review of that content. And why we're getting the kind of results. We are with clients when we use the material is. There seems to be this, oh, a access first of all to the negative beliefs and then there is this very, very deliberate focus on release and an opportunity to get access to where our own harnessing calm capacity while we're facing this negative belief. And so the kinds of results that we're seeing are quite interesting, because people who have been holding on to old stories or old negative beliefs like this individual, uh… had been, there has a quite a significant trauma history, but was carrying on a belief everywhere he went, that he, he was gonna bee at risk if somehow, uh… loosing his safe and stable base in life. He just always felt that he was at risk. And it didn't seem to make any difference what he was doing in life or who he was interacting with. This was something that would always come to the surface leaving him feeling greatly at risk. So umm… What I want to do is leave you with this material and also just talk a little bit briefly about some of the resources. So if I am working with client and they haven't yet been able to integrate fully and I am at the end of my, uh, session, I may use, uh… some vault imagery. And we have another video that's linked to this. Again, I'm not gonna show it because I understand that we, uh… we might lose our bandwidth. So I'm not gonna show that one. Uh… But I might close off the session using something like the internal vault, uh… and I have a video to demonstrate that or Grounding Lightstream. And again, if people want those videos or any of the materials that we have available. Uh… Uh… Like this material is, is actually all free. It's just available to people who subscribe to the YouTube channel, whatisPTSD and we are realizing, uh… daily, weekly videos, umm… on Trauma Growth and Recovery. Different things that we're working with ideas and materials that might be helpful. Uh… And as well, if a client is not able to fully integrate or they recognize that they are stuck and they need a practice to take home with them to help them through something that hasn't fully resolved in the course of our session. I might give them the self compassion reflection exercise. And in this one, umm… it, it's about 10 minutes and it really gives them just a chance to integrate this idea of, you know, directing a sense of self compassion towards themselves. And we're getting a lot of good feedback on that one as well. For people who are not familiar with our Trauma Recovery Program, uh… it say, it's a self directed program and that's where a lot of the videos come from, that might be of interest. So if people want to get access to the 10 days free. You will see here it says resources. You just select resources and find comments. Uh… In this resource section, you can just login to that and get access to, to those ten free videos. Uh… So we know that certain things in our life can have indelible, distressing, uh… impact. And a recognition of that is so important because I really see that it's the negative beliefs that we carry with us, that keep us from being able to move forward and live our lives as well today as we can. Umm… I'm going just leave, uh… this for now and ask are there questions or things that you want to covered before I finish. And I want to just thank you for your time today. 

00:35:00
CAROL M. SMITH Anna. 

00:35:00
ANNA I'm, I'm on the phone now, that's interesting. Umm… Your numerical points in the positions on the chart, one, two, three, four, five. Umm… Are you using a theoretical rational for the order of where you will use your points? 

00:35:15
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Oh that's a great question. Umm… You know, what? I, I have to tell you that, umm… this whole thing came to me in a dream. I know that sounds really ridiculous, but, the, the reality is that the whole map came to me in a dream one night. I was thinking about a client of mine, who was very, very badly bullied over, that… Well, the course of about 10 years. And he had these terribly negative beliefs. Then every time we, we had a session, I saw his eyes rolling and wandering. And so I was trying to remember what he was doing and, and talking about and all of a sudden this map just came into my head. I'm just playing with it. I started to use it with, uh… clients who are willing to practice new things. So whenever I worked with something new, I always tell my clients, you know, this is a new approach, uh… I want to tell you what we're doing. Uh… Explain it to them and if they are willing, if they are open to try it out, that's great. So the, the reality is, as I started to look for the theoretical under pinning's after the map came to me. 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN That's good. Thank you. 

00:36:30
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Um, huh… So it's not, uh… you know, it's not until I really started to think about what was happening with the client, that I came to this, umm… kind of the, the layout of all of this. And, you know, and I guess this is where, you know, the strangest things can, can happen. I'm sure everybody is familiar with mirror neurons and how, umm… you know, this little, uh… laboratory in Parma, Italy, they had these, uh… monkeys hooked up to these umm… scan, brain scans. And, and what they were doing is, you know, the, the monkeys would have these peanuts and the monkeys would open up the peanuts and then, uh… you'd see their brains kind of laying up in certain areas and then all of a sudden, uh… .There was an event in which the monkey saw a researcher opening up a peanut and all of their same brain areas started to light up. Totally not by design, they discovered something that was really remarkable. So this is kind of like, how I came up with this idea of where the ordering of the focus points were. Umm… Completely by random watching my clients searching in their own minds for, uh… material or talking about something that was very traumatic in their lives. So as I said before, what I want to do is, if people are interested in the material and you want to try it out on your own, uh… we're actually in the process of looking at thematic map and release as it is embedded in the trauma practice approach, uh… with York University. So we're in the middle of a, of developing the protocols for the research project right now. So if people are interested an established trauma therapist and want to be involved in a research project, then please do let us know as well, because we are trying to, umm… form partnerships with different organizations or clinicians in the community or at universities, wherever you are, uh… in order to, uh… create a good study. So that's something else, just in case you have interest in doing that. Okay. So Jane and Carol, I am going to hand it back to you and if you want to close out, that's great. 

00:39:05
CAROL M. SMITH Anna, this is Carole. I did have one question. And do you find that clients need to do a thematic map and release with each theme or memory? Or do you find sometimes that clients will spontaneously apply a thematic map and release session from a, a given memory that you've worked with together, two other memories or themes in their lives spontaneously or you find a mix of that? 

00:39:40
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Yeah. So that's actually really good. Okay, so I'm gonna go back to what I talked before about the trigger list. Uh… Usually, you know, clients will identify a whole series of events that, then, they, I , they, they can recognize, uh… create or form a theme. People tend to have fewer themes than memories. Umm… In general, just as in doing good trauma work, clients might spontaneously resolve umm… other traumas that are some how related or trigger in a similar way. When you do a good, umm… trauma therapy session, whatever approach you are using, you might find that they might be focused on a car accident that they had 10 years ago. But when they think of the one that they had 12 years ago, that also feels more resolved after the, umm… the good trauma work you did on the more recent trauma accident. So in the same way, I have been finding that if somebody struggles with a theme, they may also be able to apply what they are, umm… their mechanism for resolution. Sometimes, what I've been hearing from clients is that, when I give them the little link uh… to the short session, they can use that approach, just turn it on and kind of imbed the strategies themselves. If there is a new theme and it's more complex and they are struggling with it. Sometimes they will bring it to session and we'll just start from scratch. But there are clients who are using the, the short link, the five minutes video that I tried to show you and that seems to help quite a bit. Because the work takes a whole hour, the, the, and the strategy is so easy to learn, clients are able to adapt the, the guided portion of the work to, to their own struggles when they are on their own and reflecting, so yes. 

00:42:00
CAROL M. SMITH I have a follow up question as well. I, I watched the, the relatively short version with, your work with Sebastian, uh… who looks a lot like Robert De Niro, umm… at least in the video he does. He could have a second career, being his stand-in. Umm… I am wondering if the method of effectiveness is the repeated exposure or is it the repeated exposure paired with the relaxing and self care, or is it also somehow integrally tied with the various I positions, or is it simply the repetition of going through the theme and then the subjective units of distress at each of the seven kinds? 

00:42:55
ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Okay, good, good question. First, I don't ask for the subjective units of distress until the very end. I ask once in the beginning, then I ask at the very, very end. 

00:43:05
CAROL M. SMITH Okay. 

00:43:05
ANNA B. BARANOWSKY I don't go back over and over again. What I really want to gain access to is, what is that, what is the content at each focus point? Now it's very interesting because I have yet, I've had hundreds. I have done hundreds and hundreds of session already with the thematic map and release. And at each focus point, we get different content. We get access to different content. 

00:43:35
CAROL M. SMITH Oh, that's key. 

00:43:35
ANNA B. BARANOWSKY That's what I want to do. 

00:43:35
CAROL M. SMITH Okay, that makes sense. 

00:43:35
ANNA B BARANOWSKY It's really is, it's really interesting, Carol. It's Carol, right? It's really interesting, Carol, because I am not getting the same thing at each focus point. I am getting different content at each focus point. 

00:43:55
CAROL M. SMITH Oh, okay. 

00:43:55
ANNA B BARANOWSKY They may talk about… 

00:43:55
CAROLE Interesting. 

00:44:00
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Yeah, it's so, it's so interesting. It's so, and it get, it gets into areas that are so deeply embedded. And I think that's why it's effective. Because, you know, normally, you know, we might have a talk session with the client. We don't get access to this content. And even if we do get access to the content, I don't necessarily have a contract in that session to then take them to release. So if they get access to a deep sense of vulnerability… Oh, you know, my mother was so mean to me. I was five years old and I felt modally rejected. Whatever it is, whatever the story is. Umm… 

00:44:45
CAROL M. SMITH Right. 

00:44:45
ANNA B. BARANOWSKY We get access to that. What are, what are we gonna do with it in a talk session? We will get access to the release because we don't have the contract necessarily. We might get some release but, once we get access to that piece, than we might get access to another piece. Oh, I feel this wounded my body or I, I sense the shame or I remember my sister, you know, also saying nasty things to me or when I went to school, people rejecting. So because it's a theme, we can get access to many different stories, content, emotions that come from different places or points in our lives. So it's about getting access to the content. The release piece, you know, just, you know, going back to this idea of umm… exposure and relaxation, we get extinction, but because we're looking at a theme and these themes are hooked into memories. It's profound because now we're getting access to so much material so rapidly. And I think that's why, you know, with Sebastian, here's a client whose been, you know, working to feel better and struggling and, uh… he made this very radical shift in a very rapid session like, you know, a 50 minute session, 47 minutes I think in total for him. 

00:46:15
CAROL M. SMITH Uh… huh… And one other follow up question and this is a little bit gee-gee, forgive me for that. Umm… I noticed when you were asking Sebastian in the video for his emotions and feelings related to the theme. He was, he stayed in a really sort of cognitive mindset, where he said surprise and dry mouth and feel my hands get cold, those kinds of things. I didn't hear any of this sort in the primary emotion labels, like, I feel afraid, I feel ashamed, I am sad. And I'm wondering, if do, do you do any work where you ask clients to develop an emotional vocabulary and facility with using these sort of primary emotional words, or do you just let it go with whatever emotional vocabulary there… they are choosing to use? 

00:47:15
ANNA B BARANOWSKY So if I find that somebody staying too intellectual. And, you know, it's interesting that you're saying this. Sebastian was virtually on the, the point is, of tears from the beginning of the session. You'd, obviously in a video, it's hard to see it. Uh… You are not looking at him directly in the eyes. If somebody stays in too cognitive of a state, I would obviously pull them out of that and ask them to stay more connected with the, with the content or their experience. Umm… And yes, if they are not able to access it, I am gonna help guide them a little bit. But I would probably have done a lot of that before I even start the thematic map. 

00:48:00
CAROL M. SMITH Okay. 

00:48:00
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Yeah. 

00:48:00
CAROL M. SMITH That makes sense. 

00:48:00
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Because once, once you're into the, the stuff of it, you know, I might gently guide them back to their experience. Umm… But I would have wanted to do a lot of that in advance. 

00:48:15
CAROL M. SMITH That makes sense. I'm, I'm reminded of a client that I worked with early on when I was just a master's level student in an internship setting. She was working her way through a divorce and, you know, I did the olds, you know, wet behind the ears, young counselor, question I said. So when you think about this, this intending divorce, how does that make you feel? You know, it's like, oh God, not that question, please avoid that question. And, but she, her answer was just shows, shocked me. She just said, it makes me feel resolute. And as a young therapist I had no idea what to do with a feeling that was expressed as resolute. I didn't know what to do with that. 

00:49:00
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Uh… huh. 

00:49:05
CAROL M. SMITH So, umm… I, I have learnt since then to kind a help clients find words for their experiences and to umm… as you say, you know, build safe containers to hold those feelings. 

00:49:20
ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Uh… huh. Yeah, there is a a back peeling, back of the layers that, I think it becomes more available as your clinical skills… I mean, obviously, you know, as your clinical skills become more practiced. Or just become available to get people there. And there is a feel, I think people have that sense and that feeling when there's an, when there's knowledge and there's like a containing vessel. And you created in the room, clients feel it. They know that there's going to be sufficient sturdiness for them to do that work. 

00:50:00
CAROL M. SMITH Yes, yeah, absolutely. 

00:50:05
ANNA B BARANOWSKY But, uh… .you know, that doesn't take away from the fact that I, I think that using approaches that get access to the unconscious mind, these layers of beliefs that can, you know, follow somebody even when they have done excellent trauma work. You know, getting access to it is really important. So you know, I mean, I just like what I find when I have done very extensive trigger list and then, you know, peel back all of that and say… Well, when you look at all of these 20 things on your trigger list, what, we use them together. You know, what's similar or familiar and reading through all the 20 items and writing out the studs rating for each of them seems to prime them and make access those themes in a way that, just a normal conversation might not and then I can do that work. 

00:51:00
CAROL M. SMITH Just fascinating. Yes, that makes sense. 

00:51:05
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Any other questions? Any kind of thoughts, uh… like I said, I'll make sure that the, the scripts are available. And umm… are you gonna be teaching your students this material. 

00:51:15
CAROL M. SMITH I, I have the book and I have not read through it yet. I will use the book in the course. I'm trying to figure out a safe and experiential way to use the material with these inexperienced students because they haven't even gone through their internships yet. So I'm trying to figure out what's the, what's the safe way to, to use the material. 

00:51:40
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I get that. That's a really, really good question. So how, how, what year are they? Are they all graduate students? 

00:51:50
CAROL M. SMITH They are, they are master's level students. And they are taking, umm… they are adding to their master's degree a certificate of studies in violence, loss, and trauma. And this particular course is the advanced, advanced trauma treatment. So I'm looking at, like complex trauma and people with duel diagnosis and how do you manage these sort of worst case, cases? 

00:52:15
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Right. That's excellent. And actually thematic map and release is well suited to this, because it, it creates that holding container, uh… and gets access to multiple traumas themes relating to multiple traumas. 

00:52:30
CAROL M. SMITH That's terrific. Yeah. 

00:52:30
ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Umm… 

00:52:30
CAROL M. SMITH I am exceptional happy about your and Eric's book because the students are veraciously hungry for tools that they can use. And this book goes beyond all of the, the other books that are out there, that have full of theory and full of (inaudible ) and generalities, but this provide specific tools. And, and the students are very appreciative of that. 

00:52:55
ANNA B BARANOWSKY So you might want to get… If they are very hungry for tools, uh… you might want to get them to subscribe to the umm… YouTube channel, the whatisPTSD channel on YouTube because we, like I said we, we're releasing the videos once a week so you know, they are really, most of them are filled with suggestions, tips, umm… exercises. Like we just released a, umm… 27 minute sleep exercise and people are just like… 

00:53:30
CAROL M. SMITH How nice. Uh… uh… 

00:53:30
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Oh, they are just so excited about it. I think in, in a month we had like, umm… almost 900 hits on the video because people are just using it, they are sharing it and they are excited about it and they are interested in the, the, the approach. And we are getting emails from people, feedback about the, the sleep video. Umm… People who haven't been able to go to sleep are sleeping with this video. So it's really great and very practical. 

00:53:55
CAROL M. SMITH And, and one of the main questions that comes up in my class is frequently, is from students is… How, how can we sleep better? The students themselves are stressed because as we all know, they frequently have trauma backgrounds themselves. 

00:54:15
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Exactly. 

00:54:15
CAROL M. SMITH And they are… Plus they are in… They are in grad school and that's a stressful experience in and of itself. And sleep deprivation is a common theme in our students. Yeah. 

00:54:25
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Yeah. So welcome to, umm.., you know, email. Just send me an email and I'll get Mandy(ph) to, to send you the sleep dec that we have. That's a… There are a couple of things, that's our… The video, umm… And strategies, tools and tips. Umm… Umm… Material that we have, that you can share with your students as well. 

00:54:55
CAROL M. SMITH That will be great. 

00:54:55
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Yeah. 

00:54:55
CAROL M. SMITH That will be great. I am, I am so, so grateful for your time. I'm very aware that it is now 2'o clock and lot of us have schedules. 

00:55:00
ANNA B BARANOWSKY Yes. 

00:55:05
CAROL M. SMITH And meetings that we have to take. Thank you so, so much. 

00:55:05
ANNA B BARANOWSKY My pleasure. 

00:55:10
CAROL M. SMITH I, I'll follow up. I'll follow up with you to see if there's anything that we should add to our traumatology interest network website in follow up to this presentation, umm… for our members. Thank you again so, so much. 

00:55:20
ANNA B. BARANOWSKY My pleasure and have a great day and thank you for the invitation and let us know if there's any thing we can do. And feel free to use all our resources. Enjoy the day. 

00:55:35
CAROL M. SMITH Take care, bye-bye.
