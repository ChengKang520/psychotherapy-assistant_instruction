THINKING ALLOWED with Jeffrey Mishlove 

00:00:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome, I'm Jeffrey Mishlove, today we are going to be exploring a novel by Dr. Irvin Yalom called When Nietzsche Wept. Dr. Yalom is a professor of psychiatry at Stanford University and the author of numerous books on psychotherapy including Love’s Executioner, Every Day Gets a Little Closer; A Twice-told Therapy, Existential Psychotherapy, the theory in practice of group psychotherapy and inpatient group psychotherapy. Welcome Irvin. 

00:01:00
IRVIN YALOM Thank you. 

00:01:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE This is your first novel and I believe of what you have attempted to do here is, look at the hypothetical origins of… of the very field of psychotherapy itself by positing a relationship that never took place between the great philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche and Josef Breuer, who was one of Freud's mentors and really in a fact to call founder with Freud of psychoanalysis how… what gave you that idea? 

00:01:30
IRVIN YALOM , MD When Nietzsche Wept Well, the… the I some time ago, I wrote a text book called Existential Psychotherapy in which I tried to look at the experience of psychotherapy, try to look at all of the empirical evidence that combine to bear on try to define what existential psychotherapy was, suggests various ways in which just could be used in… in psychotherapy. Since then I've looked for a ways to sort of deepen that those issues and other ways to kind of think about and write about the issues, the last book, I did before this one was a book called Love’s Executioner in which I dramatized some case histories and used each of them as a… as a type of a… a teaching tale in a sense that's exactly what I am trying to do in this novel although I have made it entirely fictional, entirely fictional but many of the events that have happened, I have taken from… from the various situations in… in psychotherapy. 

00:02:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE When there is a sense in which it rings true that it had these people met each other and might have gone this way. 

00:02:35
IRVIN YALOM That’s right, in a… in a forward to the book which I… which was never published, because the publishers weren't satisfied entirely with that, but I… I was trying to say that very thing although this is fictional all the events the historical events are true except for the month or so that this book… this book covers, but everything was there historically in place than all that was needed with some type of… of catalyst, you know drop of imagination to make everything occurs and did a kind of alternate reality. So, what’s… what I've done is to throw in a 2nd December of… of 1882 and what might have happened had Nietzsche been placed in a situation where he might have been called upon to invent psychotherapy from… drawing from his own philosophical teachings. 

00:03:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Its… its interesting because, Breuer is… is so different from Nietzsche, Breuer was a very successful man in according to the standards of soc… society, a wealthy doctor married into a wealthy family with a successful practice and a distinguished scientific career and Nietzsche was in a fact a dropout, one of the first hippies he had left his academic position at the University of Basel in Switzerland and there is a sense in which Nietzsche gloats in his pain, in his misery it's as if is anguish is driving him to ever deeper philosophical explorations and… and you see in comparison that the… that the conventional success of Breuer is somewhat shallow. 

00:04:05
IRVIN YALOM That’s right… that’s right actually I… I started the book, started thinking about the book from the standpoint of… of Nietzsche as the major character, because I felt that, there is so much in Nietzsche's philosophy which is terribly important in psychotherapy, un-relatively, un-harvested that… that so many of the… of the ideas that are extremely contemporary in psychotherapy they can be, it can be found in Nietzsche. So I began to… to develop an idea, of how Nietzsche himself might have invented psychotherapy and I… I selected a time in his life, when he was in… in great despair and as the… the time that… that is very evident was, right after his friendship, his affair… love affair, chased love affair with Lou Salome ended in… in 1882. This was still many years before… before the end of his life. 

00:05:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Lou Salome, I might mention as considered one of the most influential women in… in the German speaking world. 

00:05:15
IRVIN YALOM That’s right… that’s right and she is certainly, Nietzsche encountered her when she was quite young, when she was 21, but she went on to have quite a illustrious career as a… as a women of letters, as an… as an essayist and later as a… as a psychoanalyst, but at that time she was quite young and Nietzsche was one of the first men that she had been deeply involved with although their relationship lasted only… only a few months. So, I… I… I thought of finding Nietzsche in great despair and then began thinking of a way that Nietzsche might be helped by Lou Salome arranging for him to see a therapist at that point and then I began and I also had the idea fairly early on that it would be a therapist who couldn’t work in any way with Nietzsche other than in a sense to present himself to Nietzsche as a patient as someone in need. 

00:06:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In this year 1882 and in fact psychotherapy hadn't been invented. 

00:06:20
IRVIN YALOM Exactly, so that was my dilemma, so I began to search through European history and there was a school of psychotherapy, a school of therapy in… in France, but they were really doing nothing but hypnotic suggestion and I thought perhaps of… of the clergy to see whether or not and if there won't be psychotherapist and then… then it occurred to me to think of Breuer although psychotherapy as you say hadn't been invented, it did happen that Breuer had treated this one case of Anna O and suddenly lo and behold, I noticed the timing was perfect that he had seen Anna O that their relationship had somehow, something had happened that was very mysterious in their relationship and just about the time that Nietzsche was in his great despair would have timed it, Breuer himself might have been quite troubled by what happened in… in his work with Anna O, so they… I then began to think of a fictional meaning between the two and where I really didn’t have to restore many of the historical facts about the two. 

00:07:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE The historians of psychoanalysis I understand today think that Breuer really got to a meshed with her that might have bordered upon therapeutic abuse. 

00:07:30
IRVIN YALOM Well, there… there is certainly is a lot of controversy about that, but one thing is for sure that the two of them were very much involved with one another that the Nietzsche was quite… that the Breuer was quite troubled by the… the way that their relationship evolved. There is this tale in psychiatric history of Anna O developing a type of delusional pregnancy and Breuer breaking it half way whether that’s true or not there is… there is still some controversy. So I tried to meet both of these men at this particular juncture in their lives and then have them thrown into an encounter with one another engineered by… by Lou Salome and from that point on once the two of them together the… the rest of the… the novel is really a story of their… of their relationship with Breuer trying every means at his disposal to try and induce Nietzsche to take a look at the psychological issues going on in his life Nietzsche might well have seen Breuer, because Nietzsche was quiet sick physically throughout all these years probably with a very severe form of migraine and Breuer was an eminent medical diagnostician. So, all that came to not Nietzsche was adamant and refusing to do this with Breuer, suspicious of Breuer's motives in a lot of different ways until Breuer finally head upon what seem to him an ingenious ploy which is to… to arrange to seek help from Nietzsche for his Breuer's despair with the idea that sooner or later he would begin to reverse the rows once again. So then Breuer in a sense enters Nietzsche care for… for work on his own feelings about Lou Salome and also his own 40-year-old midlife crisis. 

00:09:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE With the part there in which you characterize Nietzsche here as a person who is unwilling or almost incapable of engaging in a… in a real honest face to face human social relationship ring true and also the idea that… that Nietzsche a kind of glorified his own pain and misery and… and spoke of how he… he owed so much to his migraines that disabled to him for nearly three hundred days a year, because it pushed him philosophically that ring true and it seemed so important tonight I guess, which struck me as it seems, so counter to the… the normal conventional way, we have of thinking and I get the idea that… that in developing Nietzsche's character and basing it historically you are making a comment yourself on everyday social conventional reality. 

00:10:05
IRVIN YALOM Yes I… I think Nietzsche was… well first of all Nietzsche did have a tremendous dearth of… of closeness and intimacy in his life. There were really no intimate close relationships that… that… that he… that he kept there were relationships with, few relationships with men that he continued through that, but he was a wanderer all of his adult life as he had a very early age he became a professor of not philosophy, but actually philology at… at Basel… at Basel but… then soon became desperately ill and then for the rest of his life he was a wanderer going from one hotel to another in search of good weather and freedom from his pain. So, he lived the life of a… of a type of… of… of migrant without any ongoing close intimate relationships and he also felt that… that it was… it was his… his life quest to plunge as deeply into himself as possible, Freud was later to say that… that… that Nietzsche knew more about himself than any man who ever lived from a continuous type of… of… of self-analysis, but… but Nietzsche felt that, if we look very deeply into ourselves then we are going to discover the pain of existence in the bas… in the basic isolation and… and encounter idea… ideas about that, so for him, the idea of comfort that… that perhaps behavioral therapist might pursue… it would be… would be very much in contrast with the idea of self-growth and… and… and learning about one self. 

00:11:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I think there is a wonderful scene in the book where Nietzsche actually experiments with behavioral therapy on Breuer and then rejects it to saying that you know "This is stuff for animal trainers, since its beneath the dignity of… of what a real philosophical incurring, a real therapy must be about." 

00:11:50
IRVIN YALOM Yeah, but the… that symptom that the Nietzsche has called upon to… to work with… with Breuer's… Breuer's obsession, his love obsession with… with Bertha that… that he… he cannot get out of his mind and he just invades himself… 

00:12:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Bertha is Anna O. 

00:12:05
IRVIN YALOM Yeah, Bertha is Anna O exactly. So… so Nietzsche is in a sense confronted with this task, how do we get this… this obsession out of his mind. Nietzsche's idea right from the beginning is that this obsession is trivia that its… its really blinding to Breuer about the real issues that trouble him in life, but there is no way that he can help Breuer as a sought of see that or understand that, even though Breuer could even accepted intellectually the… the obsession keeps going on and on. So, Breuer says do something about my symptom get it out of the way, so then Nietzsche in a sense begins to invent behavior therapy and uses lots of stop, thinking kinds of… of modes or punishing him or rewarding him if he is able to stop thinking about this or instructs him to think about that the certain number of minutes a day, but then finally both of the men give up this in despair and Nietzsche declares that… that how can a technique that… that lowers the therapist raise the patient and so then they go on to discover and explore a whole different kind of set towards the symptom which is the look at the meaning of the symptom what is a… what is Bertha Anna O really mean to Breuer and that pose him much more deeply into the fact that he is really using this woman, using this obsession without really relating to the woman, but that she meet so many needs and purposes in his life and… and in a sense that’s one of the things that fuels the obsession and that gradually begins to… to lead Breuer to real… real crisis and a real new understanding of his relationship with Bertha and then of course later on there is a… there is a still sometime remaining in and then Breuer begins to discover that may be there is some way that he can help Nietzsche after all. 

00:13:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But the sense that I have, is that Breuer is only able to help Nietzsche after he becomes totally vulnerable to him. He strips himself of all pretends at this point of being able to heal Nietzsche, he becomes Nietzsche's patient and that’s the thing that turns it around. 

00:14:10
IRVIN YALOM That’s right and in… in a sense the… the… the thing that I am trying to show there has got to do with the… the genuineness or the… or the importance of the authenticity of the relationship as long as Breuer is… is pretending that somehow he is… he is Nietzsche patient or attempting to still manipulate Nietzsche, they get nowhere but finally as… as you say when he gives that all up in a sense becomes perhaps seduced by the power of psychotherapy and begins to relate entirely honestly to Nietzsche then things begin to change and finally towards the… towards the end of the book he… he dwarfs all of this pretends and admits to Nietzsche the intend from the very beginning to in a sense manipulate and… and beguile Nietzsche and then things begin to change very quickly. 

00:15:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You saying there, you're making a comment about see yourself as a therapist you find a need to be that vulnerable. 

00:15:10
IRVIN YALOM Well I'm… I'm… I'm making a statement that I think that to extent to which we attempt to manipulate treat the others… treat the other… the patient treat the client as… as I think as an object that we are going to change manipulate in some way that the… the less likely we are to be… to be helpful in helping that person really change and really grow, you know Nietzsche very frequently spoke of the whole idea of… of the over-man of… of self-overcoming as I have to stress(ph) that's… that's a major theme in a sense, but you know sometimes we… we lose side of the notion that… that Nietzsche really wasn’t talking about overcoming others or becoming a superman in terms of subjugating or conquering others, what he was really talking about is overcoming ourselves. He had one granted sentence that he often would say, which is that there is… there is nothing more important that one should become who one was. So that self overcoming for Nietzsche meant overcoming oneself which meant exploring oneself as deeply as possible, so I'm…I'm… I use that a sense of the cornerstone for… for…for Nietzsche's approach to… to therapy and I think it's in a sense an important cornerstone much would goes on a contemporary psychotherapy. 

00:16:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Towards the end of the novel Breuer comes to the realization that, in a fact he lacks Nietzsche's courage, that he is only willing to probe himself so far before would threaten his… his family, his position in… in the community and you seem to be suggesting that it was appropriate for Breuer to stop at that point. 

00:16:50
IRVIN YALOM Yeah, in a sense Breuer realizes that perhaps this is as far as he can go. 

00:16:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE He is no Nietzsche. 

00:16:55
IRVIN YALOM He is no Nietzsche and… and but… but Nietzsche is no Breuer and… and Nietzsche in a sense can’t… can't embrace the… the everyday realities and satisfactions of… of Breuer's life because in a sense he lacks the skills, lacks the background to be able to relate to others in this type of way. So, but in terms of exploring himself or exploring the existential varieties of life I think Nietzsche is able to go much further than Breuer much further than perhaps… than perhaps any one. 

00:17:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now you… you mentioned earlier that Nietzsche hit upon the idea that the way to treat a symptom is to ask the question what does this symptom mean and to explore that, with some thoroughness and depth and they make a lot of progress at that point, how can you relate that notion to… to psychotherapy in general is… is that the way you see therapy yourself? 

00:17:55
IRVIN YALOM Well, I think so what… what happened was that… that both… both men began to realize that the… the symptom itself was simply a messenger, was a messenger saying that there is some deeper anxiety was erupting inside and they really have to take a look at what the deeper anxiety was about and for Breuer age 40, it was an anxiety that had… that led into ideas about the fact that he had reached the peak of his life that ahead of him nothing was… was apparent, but the decline and diminishment that he felt that he had never really been free, that he had never chosen his life and it was at this point that Nietzsche decides that he is ready to be confronted with what Nietzsche calls his… his mightiest thought it’s the idea of eternal return which is a very interesting… very interesting notion often we kind of think about this is something quite 19 centuries, but I was trying to exploring this novel, its notion, its Nietzsche's idea and he has a several sort of cosmological proofs for this but basically its an idea of to think about the fact that if… if time is… is truly infinite that everything that… that happens now, has happened already once before, just a sheer recombination of all molecules and all possibilities and if it has happened once before its going to happen again in the future and its going to keep on happening through all infinity and… and Nietzsche earlier on begins to drop the notion that this can be proven in any kind of empirical method, but mainly he wants to say, just consider this as a thought experiment, consider the possibility that if this is the case what implications would it have for the way that you live your life. In other words, the first phrase with the… with the idea, that the way we live, the way we make our choices the… the kinds of action we engaged in… in this life are the… are the same kind of choices we are going to be making throughout all infinity that it might give us pause about how we behave, how we operate whether or not we actually seize the opportunities that are head of us. So, when Nietzsche gives Breuer this thought, this idea of eternal return it really shakes Breuer to his foundations and begins to help him grab on a whole different way with whether or not he was going to let his life live him or whether or not he is somehow going to try to live his life and make free choices. 

00:20:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You know, there is something sex system about the book in the sense there is this deep relationship between these two men and of course in the 19th century was… was a period I would have to say of greater sexes a much greater than we have today and yet the relationship between Nietzsche and Breuer and the various women in their lives are very… very different, they… they seem to lack that kind of authenticity and there is a sense in which the men never see these women for who they really are. 

00:20:55
IRVIN YALOM That’s right, I… I think that’s very true it’s certainly true for Nietzsche, in Breuer I have tried to… tried to illustrate that the there was something that Breuer was able to discover for himself, but Nietzsche there is… there is hardly any different in Nietzsche in that account, he was very misogynous and some of his statements about women are… are… are… are… are really rather outrageous, you know Nietzsche himself talked about the fact that he… he lived… his father died when he was quiet young four or five years old, so he was raised by mother, by grandmother, by aunt surrounding him and had a sister who was rather powerful individual. So his whole life was lived and then he was controlled to a great extend by… by women and never was able to have a satisfactory relationship with a women in his adult life. 

00:21:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Another theme that it is quite interesting in the book is that in the background of all of this is Sigmund Freud, who is Breuer's young prodigy so to speak and throughout there is a sort of debate or dialogue between Breuer and Freud about the existence of the unconscious, Breuer trying to deny it as most of his contemporaries did, but Nietzsche in effect embracing the idea with no difficulty whatsoever. 

00:22:10
IRVIN YALOM You know there… there are really some striking parts of Nietzsche in which it’s very clear that he knew a whole lot about the dynamic unconscious of course before Freud did, but… but… but, that… that’s really knows… know nothing new because, in… in fact there were many discussions of the… of the unconscious before Freud and Freud said at one point that… that many people have asserted with the unconscious, but he was the… he was the first to marry it. So… so and… and the whole question of to what extent really Freud had read Nietzsche, Freud often denied that he had read a great deal of Nietzsche and at other times she said that he deliberately didn’t read Nietzsche because the ideas were so close to him that it would interfere with his sense of needing to be original. Freud and Nietzsche are different very much in that way, Nietzsche had a… had a sense that… that it was important for him to uncover the past rules he have this idea that he wanted to discover all the secret hiding places of the great men of the past, so they would come out into his sunshine you see, so he… he wasn’t want to… to sort of deny that these thoughts have existed long… long before him that we simply discover them a new, but at the time of this writing Freud was 26-years-old, he was still a student and as you… you pointed out Breuer was a mentor Freud became interested very early in this case of Anna O and it was the… the sort of turning point for Freud and his life began to get an idea of… of a new way that one could approach the psychoneurosis and Freud’s first book in the whole realm of psychotherapy was the book Studies on Hysteria in 1895, which he co-authored with Breuer. 

00:23:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Now it’s interesting because, Breuer used hypnosis with… with Anna O and in your novel I… I don’t want to ruin the surprise ending too much except to say that, Freud is actually hypnotizes Breuer towards the end and yet you was a therapist I… I have a sense you preferred a work with people in their normal waking state of consciousness, not the hypnotic state. 

00:24:15
IRVIN YALOM That’s true… that’s true I… I used to work hypnotically with patients a long time ago, but I hardly ever anymore, you are right I much rather work with patients in their waking state because I'm so much more interested in… in exploring the relationship between the two of us and not very interested in manipulating the symptom. The patient might not even have amnesia for what transpire between the two of us and it's hard to work hypnotically with the patients without that drastically influencing the nature of the relationship between the two of you. Freud went on to maintain an interest in hypnosis then went to… went to Paris for a year to study hypnosis and to study with Charcot in which a great deal of hypnosis was used and later for his first few patients used that becoming he gradually relinquished the idea then he never went back to it. 

00:25:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yet there’s this sense and… and may be you could comment on it that hypnosis is an extremely powerful technique that the very idea of… of the talking curious the psychoanalytic curers emerged from the evidence of hypnosis. 

00:25:20
IRVIN YALOM It… it certainly is an important tool to taking a look and… and helping one uncover the unconscious that there are… are many things about our experience that are unbenounced us another waking state, but if we find a way to gain access to them then they become known. Of course, that is done in psychotherapy without hypnosis all the time you gradually begin to… begin to chip a way at it. 

00:25:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And there is also the sense in the book that had Nietzsche had this encounter with Breuer maybe the whole field of psychotherapy would have had more of an existential orientation which is your own orientation almost have a sense like it's an effort to… to rewrite history out of that. 

00:26:00
IRVIN YALOM Oh! That’s exactly right… exactly right, you know, I feel that it’s possible to think of psychotherapy beginning at that point almost in a pre-Freudian and a non-Freudian state and to see where it might have developed. Yeah, yes that… that is so I… I do feel that way. 

00:26:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Perhaps even to legitimize or to create to… to add history to… to the existential movement which well I think is very significant, it often gets ignored in discussions of psychotherapy. 

00:26:30
IRVIN YALOM Yes and… and it is true that its roots could have been found perhaps more in Nietzsche than anyone else more I think than in Kierkegaard, and at least for me certainly more than it some of the… the latter day philosophers like… like… like how to go even Sacha… yeah, I think the roots were there in Nietzsche all along and of course many of these things that are found in Nietzsche are not original with him, it was much influence, let's… let's say for example Dostoevsky was of tremendous interest that to Nietzsche. 

00:26:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well Dr. Irvin Yalom it's been a pleasure sharing this half hour with you it's so exciting to see the rich intellectual background behind the work that you do and I think people will enjoy looking at when Nietzsche Wept as an opportunity to… to really get inside of the subtleties and the depth behind the work of psychotherapy. 

00:27:15
IRVIN YALOM Yeah, well, thank you very much. 

00:27:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Thanks so much for being with me and thank you for being with us.
