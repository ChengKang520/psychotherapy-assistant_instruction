Diana Fosha 

00:01:03
DIANA FOSHA Thank you! It's a pleasure! Good to see you! 

00:01:03
RICH SIMON So, sometimes, people come into psychotherapy are their, something terrible has happened to them, and that's the first thing they begin to talk about...and it may be, uh, a, uh, uh, a recent event, or, perhaps they have finally gotten themselves together and there's some event that's happened, uh, in th-, in the past, or sometimes in the distance passed, and that becomes the subject of therapy, and sometimes it's, it's a mix and sometimes it's, uh, i-, the, belatedly is trauma the subject. So, uh, talk to, if you, le-. let's start off a little bit about in your work, this, this distinction between Big T trauma, trauma that announces itself very directly, and some of these more, the more subtle experience of trauma and all these variations, how does that play into your work? How do, how do you experience that as a, as a therapist wo-, working within your model? 

00:02:03
DIANA FOSHA Right. Um, the Big T trauma, um, which is a very challenging kind of, um, issue to work with, has one advantage which is that it's relatively obvious. Um, it, sort of, announces itself in big and loud ways. Now, very often in the course of working with Big T trauma, or at other times in the course of somebody who comes in for relationship problems or depression or some work related kind of issues. In other words, nothing that has overtly anything to do with trauma. In, just in the course of moment to moment psychotherapy, it really becomes evident that something is amiss, and that actually sometimes, the very thing that are supposed to make therapy, um, work, which, you know, and enable work with Big T trauma and other issues which is that you form a relationship, that trust develops, that supporter, empathy, warmth are offered. 

00:03:23
RICH SIMON Uh huh. Uh huh. 

00:03:23
DIANA FOSHA They are, but something in the interaction somehow signals that it's off. 

00:03:28
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:03:28
DIANA FOSHA Tha-, right? That the person instead of feeling, that there's something about the empathy that can engender mistrust, rather than trust. There's something about the support that can actually bring up blocks, rather than, sort of, lower defenses. 

00:03:48
RICH SIMON Su-, and that's the sort of experience that most of us clinitians find... puzzling, sometimes maddening, a little bit can, can be crazy, thinking in it's own way. S-, g-, give us, let's. let's, kind of, capture this kind of experience. Can you think of, of a case, uh, whatever, a recent case or case that really stands out for you, where someone came in and yo-, this, i-, it was not immediately apparent to you that there was a, a Big T trauma or even a Small T trauma, and t-, then there was some kind of a rupture in the relationship, or things didn't go as you expected in a way that led, opened the door to, uh, a-, and investigate this kind of a investigation that we're talking about; this kind of, uh, that you had to handle this Small T trauma. Let's give, let's talk, maybe, perhaps a bit more concretely, about what that meant, and, and how yo-, and how you responded. 

00:04:43
DIANA FOSHA Well, let me give you an example. This was, um, a man who came to see me, who had moved to New York. I practice in New York, so, uh, he had just moved to the city, got my name, uh, came in, uh, in a state of tremendous anxiety. He was sweating, he was nervous, uh, he could barely catch his breath, and as we started to talk, um, and he was also very self-deprocating. He was putting himself down, from the moment he walked in. So, I said something to him relatively low key, empathic, like, well, it's hard, or it takes a lot of courage to come, so I imagine it wasn't that easy to...just get here, and his first response was, uh, is that technique? 

00:05:43
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:05:48
DIANA FOSHA Um, or a local way, or...so, in a way, that got us rolling. 

00:05:53
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:05:53
DIANA FOSHA From the get go. 

00:05:58
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:05:58
DIANA FOSHA Um, that, just, very ordinary, wasn't, ya know, just a very ordinary expression of empathy. 

00:06:03
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:06:03
DIANA FOSHA Uniquely, sort of...so...that had us off and running. 

00:06:08
RICH SIMON And tha-, so, let's stay with that for a bit. Her-, here ya go, so someone is, um, coming in, and they're in a state of aggitation, of which is it's own, kind of, clinical challenge. So, what was, what's the twist here? So, what is it, what is it, once we, when we speak, the conversation becomes a discussion of trauma, uh, Big T or Small T, um, what is it, how does that make a difference for you as a clinition? 

00:06:38
DIANA FOSHA Well, I think the twist, and in a way, this is not such a huge distinction, um, between Big T and Little T trauma, but the twist is, that from the beginning, I am going to try to... make it a point of finding, being on the lookout for, and then, sort of, reflecting back to the patient, um, something about what their doing right, rather than what they're doing wrong. 

00:07:08
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:07:13
DIANA FOSHA Some-, about things that are going well rather than things that are going poorly. 

00:07:18
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:07:18
DIANA FOSHA So...that... you know...I think in a way, it sort of surprises, uh, (ph)Mary Maid has this great phrase, "Surprise the unconscious." Uh, it surprises the unconscious of the patient who, sort of, comes in, sort of... guarded and steeled for reviewing what's inadequate or what's defective...about them, so that, um...for instance, with the man I was just talking about, over and over, instead of confronting him that, I dunno, that he was blocking me or...why were there defenses, or what was the mistrust about, whi-, wher-, where did it come from, right? That would've been a fine clinical question, or just share the observation. Ya know, in a way, I sort of, go to the side of it... and find something...positive or something appreciative. So, even with that, I might say something... I appreciate you're being direct with me. 

00:08:28
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:08:28
DIANA FOSHA Or...and it is precisely this kind of, ya know, micro-tracking that has us off and running. 

00:08:38
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:08:38
DIANA FOSHA Um... 

00:08:38
RICH SIMON So, so that's...s-, so that's a hallmark of how you think about therapy and this... 

00:08:43
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:08:43
RICH SIMON ... approach on, on looking for the positive and the thriving and the flourishing, opposed to psychopathology, but, so when the client is presenting, either directly presenting with trauma, or what emerges is, um, some attachment injury. 

00:09:03
DIANA FOSHA You're right. 

00:09:03
RICH SIMON So, how does that a-, affect the work, so that difference between how, uh, that way of working, which is, uh, i-, is, sort of, the, the way, the, the hallmark of a, uh, t-, th, the style of work that you've chosen for yourself. What's the difference, then, w-, w-, what happens when you do that with someone, where trauma is a, is a saliant issue for them? 

00:09:23
DIANA FOSHA So that, so that's, whether with this man or with somebody else, again, let's say, so that you... even when some of the Big T trauma issues are resolved, or let's say that you've been able to do some work with anxiety or depression. 

00:09:48
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:09:48
DIANA FOSHA Um, so that there's some symptom relief, or there's some actual changes that are starting to take place in the person's life. Um, the capacity to actually rely on the theraputic relationship to get support to be able to do some of the deeper work is really what...needs to become the focus of the interaction. 

00:10:13
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:10:13
DIANA FOSHA Because, whether it's Big T or Small T trauma, so we're talking about the Small T trauma; that it's really, in it starts to show up, number one, in being able to make use of the theraputic relationship, and even being able to...internalize some of the positive changes, uh, when they go beyond symptom relief. 

00:10:43
RICH SIMON So it's, so, what your, tha-, the, uh, let me, an-, and tell me if this is accurately reflects how you think about it. So there's, there's this quality, when we think of trauma, ya know, we think of...horrible things happening. We think of accidents. We think of abuse. What you're, i-, it sounds like what we're talking about is something that I'm, I'm at least refering to as relationship trauma. 

00:11:03
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:11:03
RICH SIMON Where, as you begin to move into the possibility of trust and connection with you or with another human being, instead of that leading to, uh, what one hopes is a natural response; you calm, calm down, the connection begins to develop. Instead, that's very activated, has the reverse response. 

00:11:23
DIANA FOSHA So that, for instance, if you're working with somebody who has a single incident Big T trauma, somebody who's had a horrendous car accident, or possibly a recent rape, or has been in a natural disaster. Ya know, um, there's a natural tendency in the absense or when this, kind of, Small T trauma is more muted to use the theraputic relationship for support, and very specifically, to use it for support in doing some of the big, scary work that's involved with healing trauma. 

00:12:03
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:12:03
DIANA FOSHA Now, what I'm talking about is exactly the situation when the relationship itself, instead of being soothing, or a source of support itself becomes a...source of nervous system disregulation. Ya know, become the source of aggitation. It's like, it's at th-, that exact and precise moment, this other thing, um...comes into the room and, in a way, at that point, whether the origins are Big T or Small T, becomes irrelevant. 

00:12:43
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:12:43
DIANA FOSHA Almost. In a way, obviously not, but not in another way because we're doing this same kind of thing. We're dealing with the way the nervous system is affect, we're dealing with the way that affect this process. We're dealing with disruptions that have to be regulated with an additional thing that... there's this extra added factor of shame, like... 

00:13:13
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:13:13
DIANA FOSHA Why am I having such big problems? I came from an in tact family and nothing bad ever happened to me. 

00:13:23
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:13:23
DIANA FOSHA So...it has this other way in which it could start to, sort of, build upon itself. 

00:13:28
RICH SIMON So, what's, let's, again, if, if we can focus, ya know, perhaps on th-, th-, the, th-, the, th-, man you were referring to earlier, or something else that comes to mind. So, th-, early on, the, uh, you're getting, there's this, um, this disruption, this difficulty in forming an alliance, and the, you're, you're feeling like, as th-, the therapist, gosh, ya know, I'm in, I'm in a, something else is going on other than what I'm expecting and, and that's a bit disregulating for the therapist and oddly for the client. So what's, in, in, in the way you work, what happens for you? What do you start thinking an-, and really, uh, focus of our series is, what do you begin to do? What i-, what's going on in both how you think about, what your task is, and what you being, the kinds of things you begin to do and to say in the consulting room? 

00:14:18
DIANA FOSHA Um...what I... begin to be on the lookout for are these tiny, little glimmers that are the exception to what I have just articulated. 

00:14:33
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:14:33
DIANA FOSHA Um, in other words, here's this man and, ya know, I'll tell you about, you know, somebody else, I'll, I'll give you an example o-, of somebody who comes to mind. Ya know, where there's this mistrust or there's anxiety in the relationship and, you know, as we find out later, they're amptly good reasons for that. At the same time, I am going to try to see where there's actually a connection; a way in which we're actually getting connected, a way in which, somehow past these defenses, there's at least moments of contact or moments of being more soother rather than just more regulated by the relationship, and when I find them, I will try to make them part of the theraputic dialogue. Now, I'll give you an example...of somebody that came to mind as I was talking. 

00:15:33
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:15:33
DIANA FOSHA This was a woman with both Small T and rather big, Big T trauma, uh, who was profoundly, profoundly mistrustful, and particularly mistrustful of empathy, or of kindness, or, um...ya know, she thought somehow I was interested in manipulating her. 

00:15:58
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:15:58
DIANA FOSHA Um, so we were sort of making our way through the interaction; sort of struggling through, and in a later session, she... and she really held me at a distance, so, at a later session she came in and told me that she had gotten an A in a course that she was taking, so I gave her a high five, and, ya know, sort of, she met my spontaneous gesture. She met my five. 

00:16:28
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:16:28
DIANA FOSHA So... we snuck past the defenses. 

00:16:33
RICH SIMON Okay? 

00:16:33
DIANA FOSHA So that high five, then wehen we actually connected it was high energy, it was positive and she received something that I was offering. 

00:16:43
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:16:43
DIANA FOSHA Rather than blowing me off. In a way that became... um...this other base, or this other place, if we have trauma over here, and all of the mistrust and the suspicious and the distancing, all of a sudden we're starting to create a little oasis here. 

00:17:03
RICH SIMON A little (ph)path between the two of you. 

00:17:08
DIANA FOSHA Pardon? 

00:17:08
RICH SIMON An alternative path for your relationship and possibly for her in her life. 

00:17:13
DIANA FOSHA Well, exactly why she's having such difficulty with, and we're having such a, a struggle with. All of a sudden it's not, like, the result of the work like, there it is. It's sort of like, we snuck underneath the defenses and there was this sort of. 

00:17:28
RICH SIMON Okay... 

00:17:28
DIANA FOSHA And, there are many of those kinds of spontaneous gestures, just something as simple as, sort of, looking out the window and seeing a beautiful sunset, or a piece of music, or, ya know, inc-, sometimes incidentals, and sometimes actual to the side interactions, like, we're in the middle of some, rather, frot... 

00:17:48
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:17:48
DIANA FOSHA ... Moment, and there's a little smile. I mean, we're talking about something pretty heavy duty. Maybe we've having a hard time? With each other? But, all of a sudden, there's a fleeting spo-, a smile. 

00:18:03
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:18:03
DIANE FOSHA I might, at that point, start to shift my focus...just for a second. We'll go right back to what we were dealing with, but do you mind, could we just spend a sex-, why, what happened there? What's inside? 

00:18:18
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:18:18
DIANA FOSHA And, so, it's these moments of healing, or these moments when exactly the kind of thing that we're, sort of, slogging through and trying to get to, um, on the side of the attachment trauma, on the side of Big T trauma, or the psychopathology... become these little glimmers or these little oases. 

00:18:48
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:18:48
DIANA FOSHA Well, exactly what we're trying to accomplish is already there. 

00:18:53
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:18:53
DIANA FOSHA Allright. So, there, there's, that's part impartial of, sort of, bringing energy into the system. 

00:18:58
RICH SIMON So, what you've described to me, it, it sounds, um, it's, that's, i-, it...what's the distinction cuz it sounds to me what you're describing sounds lovely, and that sounds like that's an experience that clients, that you wanna make sure that clients have with you whatever else is goin' on in their life. So, in this particular focus, what's the difference between somebody, where there's, there's this special level of difficulty in forming the relationship? Cuz what you, you might have a moment like that with somebody, uh, who has not had, uh, the, uh, uh, enduring attachment injury, uh, who's, who's presenting something that's much more straigh forward? What's the distinction? What's different for you when you're working with, with somebody where, is a trauma of some sort seems to be a central issue for that person? 

00:19:53
DIANA FOSHA I think the distinction is that, um...I think I'm repeating myself, but... 

00:19:58
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:19:58
DIANA FOSHA Let, let me try it again. But, um, ya know, for me, one... what the issue...at stake in trauma is that...um...the very people, whom one is supposed to trust, are the ones who have been the source of the injury. 

00:20:28
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:20:28
DIANA FOSHA And have been the source of the betrayl so that it shows up...um...sometimes in unexpected places like, um, a reluctance to celebrate victories. 

00:20:43
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:20:43
DIANA FOSHA Or, ya know, being perfectly willing, relatively speaking, or having an easier time, let me put it that way cuz that's probably more accurate. However difficult it is to deal with the negative emotions associated with the trauma, with the Big T trauma, um, at the same time, sometimes it ends up being, relatively speaking, somewhat easier than dealing with the positive emotions. 

00:21:13
RICH SIMON Okay. So, I guess, I'm talking about, I, I think I'm, I'm understanding that part. So, um, I'm really more focused on you as the therapist. So, you might do a high five with, eh, uh, other kinds of clients, and... 

00:21:28
DIANA FOSHA Yeah. 

00:21:28
RICH SIMON And it would ha-, you would create this moment of celebration and you create this positive experience, um, or, or even with this gentleman who comes in and is immediately distrustful... 

00:21:43
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:21:43
RICH SIMON Of, uh, or attempted to establish a relationship with him. So, whoever it is that's coming in, you're going for this material. You're trying to, uh, create a certain kind of atmosphere in the therapy and your focus; you don't wanna, you're not focusing on psychopathology initially. So that's, um, so you're doing that, whoever's coming into your office. 

00:22:03
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:22:03
RICH SIMON So, but, i-, is there something different that you're doing when the-, when you're, when it emerges that this, there's some kind of a trauma background i-, in a way that, perhaps, isn't so obvious. Do you do something, not so much an explanation of them, but what's different about how you respond to any of that, versus any other client? 

00:22:23
DIANA FOSHA I'm not sure that there is anything that I do differently. I think that the difference comes in the awareness and in the heightened sensitivity to those kinds of issues and how to work with them, I am not sure that I'd do anything different. 

00:22:38
RICH SIMON Okay. Okay. 

00:22:38
DIANA FOSHA Ya know, with somebody who has issues of mistrust, regardless of their origins. 

00:22:48
RICH SIMON S-, So one of the things that strikes me about, um, how you work, is this, uh, your, uh, your focus on the moment between you and the client, what you call metaprocessing and this slowing down. 

00:23:03
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:23:03
RICH SIMON And thinking this moment's very pa-, palpable between you and the, these people that you see. Talk a little bit a-, about that a-, a-, and, if you can, ya know, just sort of, like, w-, what is it that you're, how does that work? What are the kinds of things you say? How is it that you have this way of heightening the moment, uh, uh, with the clients, this, this, and this, this idea you have about metaprocessing that's, uh, very central to the way that you work, as, as I understand it? 

00:23:33
DIANA FOSHA Absolutely, thank you. Um...and... metaprocessing and also, particularly meta, in terms of what we're talking about metaprocessing, the, the relationship itself; the experience of the relationship. So, that, um, rather than being focused on narrative, or rather than, ya know, sort of being focused on the past, needless to say, those are the kinds of things that always come into the treatment, but...it's these moment to moment shifts, sometimes subtle, sometimes not...that occur in the patient, that occur in the interaction. I'm not just noticing them and tracking them, but very often, sort of, I said about making them explicit... and then, once it's explicit, it's experiential. So, for instance, um, I dunno, with the, with a, with that, the high five woman. 

00:24:33
RICH SIMON Okay? 

00:24:38
DIANA FOSHA Um... there...okay, so we've had this moment and this sheer joy. 

00:24:48
RICH SIMON Okay? 

00:24:48
DIANA FOSHA And, I might just say stay with that. Notice what happens in your body. Just, ya know, for instance, it's a high five and she's all ready to tell me about the problem that she came in with, or... 

00:24:58
RICH SIMON Just wanting to talk. Yeah. 

00:25:03
DIANA FOSHA I might say, "We'll get to that. That's really important, but c-, might we have five minutes. We'll get to that...." 

00:25:08
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:25:08
DIANA FOSHA "...In a moment." 

00:25:08
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:25:08
DIANA FOSHA Right? "Because I don't want to, in any way, dismiss all the things that are, that she's bringing in that are her experience of the difficulties. Just at that moment, when we did that, what happened inside? What are you aware of experiencing?" So, that's how it might begin. 

00:25:28
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:25:28
DIANA FOSHA And, of course, it's nothing. Ya know, no big deal, I mean, it was nice, but. 

00:25:33
RICH SIMON Right. Uh huh. 

00:25:33
DIANA FOSHA Ya know, then for the end, I might say, "Well, I don't know, there's a little twinkly in your eye, or I see this little smile." And then it starts to go, and soometimes, so that's the beginning of trying something that's implicit. 

00:25:48
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:25:48
DIANA FOSHA And making it explicit. Right? "Oh! And I see your smile!" Like, Rich, I see you, you're nodding! There's a nice smile on your face. 

00:25:58
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:26:03
DIANA FOSHA Um...stay with me for a second. 

00:26:03
RICH SIMON Hey, I'm happy to do it! Okay. 

00:26:08
DIANA FOSHA All right? One of the phrases that goes with that is stay with it... 

00:26:13
RICH SIMON Stay with it. Okay. 

00:26:13
DIANA FOSHA ...And stay with me. Stay with it and stay with me. So, stay with it, is what many of the, sort of...body-based trauma... 

00:26:23
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:26:23
DIANA FOSHA Uh, ya know, whether you're doing EMDR, or some other sematic, it's like stay with it. See if you can really stay with it once we get to the processing. 

00:26:33
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:26:33
DIANA FOSHA The second piece of it is stay with it, which is your experience, and stay with me. Keep that connection. 

00:26:43
RICH SIMON Perhaps, boy, I really experienced that as a, as a different process. That, that's trickier. That's, i-, my immediate experience, "Oh my, I have to stay with you. Huh." 

00:26:53
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:26:53
RICH SIMON So when you, when you do that, like, boy I have to stay with you; what, what is this invitation...to stay with you and to, you're inviting me into this relationship in the moment. So, that's a very, that's a very powerful invitation. 

00:27:08
DIANA FOSHA Yes it is. 

00:27:13
RICH SIMON So when you, wha-, what determines when you, when you whe-, cuz they don't seem a-, at all to me, at least, uh, you tell me how you think about it, interchangable. So, what determines while you-, you're saying, stay with it. Okay, I can do that. 

00:27:23
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:27:23
RICH SIMON Stay with me? Oh...okay. Now I'm movin' out into unknown territory. 

00:27:28
DIANA FOSHA Exactly. Exactly. So, if you've had a relationship, a, a history of being betrayed, a history of, right? And all of a sudden, somehow, it has just snuck by, that we've shared this moment where the trust is already there? 

00:27:53
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:27:53
DIANA FOSHA WHen it's implisive, it allows things to move. The moment you make it explisive... then, as you say, all of a sudden, this, oh, this thing is happening to me. 

00:28:03
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:28:03
DIANA FOSHA Yeah. So, you wanna tell me about it? 

00:28:08
RICH SIMON So-, well, I mean, so... exactly! So, it's, it's, so, um, I, I'm thinking, "Huh. Who's inviting me into, ya know, in to trust them." It begins, it seems as if it's almost a different part of the, the Christmas tree inside... starts lighting up. So when you're saying, "Stay with it," Well, I can do that. Ya know, ya know, Diana's kinds there, that, that's, that's fine, that's nice. 

00:28:33
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:28:33
RICH SIMON I guess that's a nice energy, but I, I am within my zone of safety here. Stay with me, or, uh, uh, or, or variations of it is, like, sort of like, "Oh my! That's an alternative pathway!" So I can, can see if we're, we, we, we, we can, we can do my, my history of trauma and betrayl and abandonment, uh, early on, but, ya know, if I begin to stay with you, well, what happens at the end of the interview? She's gonna, so, it becomes, it's, it's a much more loaded statement. 

00:29:08
DIANA FOSHA More loaded so that it... 

00:29:08
RICH SIMON And so, as you (ph)parsh it, in terms of when, when, would you say something like that in a first session or, or just, say a little bit about when you are ready. When do you feel somebody is ready to, um, uh, wh-, when you issue a, kind of an invitation like that? 

00:29:23
DIANA FOSHA I mean, I sort of think of that...the other way around. 

00:29:28
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:29:28
DIANA FOSHA Uh, meaning...it has already happened. So, once it's already happened, right, I'm not creating something. So, you and I are having a relationship. All I'm doing is I'm inviting you to just to be more aware of it and be a little more explicit. 

00:29:48
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:29:48
DIANA FOSHA Right? Bring attention, b-, bring active attention to something that's already there. So, yes, I might do it. 

00:29:53
RICH SIMON Uh huh. Okay. 

00:29:53
DIANA FOSHA Um, and often do...in a first session, um...and will be... 

00:30:03
RICH SIMON And, and you notice, you notice what, you know, how people, ya know, sounds, seems to me like a very powerful way of, ya know, diagnostically in the loosest sense. Ya know, just sort of getting a sense of the person. 

00:30:18
DIANA FOSHA Exactly. 

00:30:18
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:30:18
DIANA FOSHA Getting a sense of the person and surprising them...a little bit as well. 

00:30:23
RICH SIMON Yes. 

00:30:23
DIANA FOSHA Because it's outside of ordinary social discourse. 

00:30:28
RICH SIMON That's right. That's right. 

00:30:28
DIANA FOSHA Right? It's also, somewhat, outside the ordinary...not ordinary, but it's outside of theraputic. 

00:30:38
RICH SIMON Ye-, exactly. I think it's very interesting. It's outside of the, kind of, the ordinary theraputic, uh, discourse. 

00:30:48
DIANA FOSHA Right. Right. 

00:30:48
RICH SIMON Stay with it. Notice what's going on with your body. All of that and, sort of, run of the mill people, but it takes, ya know, sort of stepping up to the plate to say, "Oh, stay with me." 

00:30:58
DIANA FOSHA Right. Right. Right. It's like... 

00:30:58
RICH SIMON At this moment, it's sort of like, "Oh my! This is, this is interesting." It's like this is a different kind of a...statement. 

00:31:03
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:31:03
RICH SIMON Yeah... and so, what, where do people go with that? I mean, it, it seems to me that what you're, uh, the way you're working, particularly going down this particular avenue, you, you would be likely to get people moving into talking with you, perhaps more than, than, uh, someone else who works in a somewhat more removed way about these issues, these very intimate issues of betrayl and abandon, uh, perhaps abuse by people who were trusted perople, but that whole likke cluster of things would emerge much more spontaneously and, and perhaps early, in, in your kind of work. If, does that your, to the degree you're aware of, of, uh, of a comparison? 

00:31:53
DIANA FOSHA I mean, it seems that way and, all of a sudden, again, we've, sort of, created a little bit of trust so that the high five woman and, ya know, what happened is that first there was this, kind of, shared laughter and giggling and it was that, sort of high spirits. 

00:32:08
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:32:08
DIANA FOSHA She wanted to shift to then talk about what you're supposed to talk about in therapy, which are your problems. 

00:32:18
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:32:18
DIANA FOSHA I brought, bring her back...um, she had softened some because of that, and we went a little back and forth with this, ju-, just stay with it, stay with your smile, notice what's happening with your body. Notice my smile. What do you see, I might say, "What do you see in my face? What do you see in my eyes?" 

00:32:38
RICH SIMON Wow! 

00:32:38
DIANA FOSHA Um...and just, ya know, really slow it down. So, what happened there is that, I don't know, within a few minutes, she really started weeping, and what came up for her, she then reflected on how my, how she had pushed me off, uh, and kept me at a distance...um, ya know, for, in prior sessions, and... 

00:33:13
RICH SIMON How long had you been seeing her? 

00:33:13
DIANA FOSHA I don't remember...I would guess, I don't know...10? And I don't mean that that had been the onyl session interactions... 

00:33:23
RICH SIMON Right. Yeah. 

00:33:23
DIANA FOSHA But, we had been, sort of, struggling. 

00:33:23
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:33:23
DIANA FOSHA Um, with this issue of trust big time, actually. 

00:33:28
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:33:28
DIANA FOSHA She burst into tears and, she said, ya know, "If I let you in, or, ya know, if I think that you're for real, what does it mean that you care about me, but my mother didn't?" 

00:33:43
RICH SIMON Wow. 

00:33:48
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:33:48
RICH SIMON That's a pretty powerful statement, there. 

00:33:48
DIANA FOSHA That's a pretty powerful statement. If I let you in... 

00:33:53
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:33:53
DIANA FOSHA ...And I, ya know, let in that you seem to really care about me, and it seems to be genuine, and so on and so forth. 

00:34:03
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:34:03
DIANA FOSHA Then... what does it say? 

00:34:08
RICH SIMON It's much more painful, I would think. Yeah, it's more painful to think, well, that's not just the way it is, but it, there's a, that, boy that really, that's, uh, I could've, perhaps I could've had that... with my own mother. 

00:34:23
DIANA FOSHA Right, and then it becomes very palpable. You know, uh, the pain...becomes very palpable. Prior to that, we had spent a lot of time, you know, clearly she was telling me about her mother, and she's angry and there are many, many, many different feelings... 

00:34:38
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:34:38
DIANA FOSHA ...Boxed through this relation on metaprocessing. 

00:34:43
RICH SIMON Uh huh. Uh huh. 

00:34:43
DIANA FOSHA It dropped us down to some really, pretty profound... um...affective pain, of realy pain, and why it's so, I mean, who wants to feel that? 

00:34:58
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:34:58
DIANA FOSHA Who wants to feel pain? None of us wanna feel pain if we can possibly avoid it. So that, anyways, so that's one of the ways in which...that particular session unfolded. 

00:35:08
RICH SIMON So, that reminds me of one of the things that you, this, uh, a particular, uh, uh statement you've made about trauma, that trauma is, um, perhaps as, as much as anything, this experience of aloneness. 

00:35:28
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:35:28
RICH SIMON And that, it, it's, even a-, as we've been doing this, this is the first time I'm really getting a sense of how you work and what you feel like to be in a room with you, working with you. So, it's, it's sort of like you're really working on this, um, and, in a sense, challenging my entrenched sense of my aloneness and inviting me across this divide. 

00:35:53
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:35:53
RICH SIMON An-, and you, you're working on my, my experience of aloneness. How, how did it, does that fit, and how do you this about this, have this, this, uh, you're, the way in which you're challenging the sense of aloneness that a client or, particularly, a traumatized client must feel? 

00:36:08
DIANA FOSHA Ya know, after 9/11, I talked to a friend of mine who worked with children. 

00:36:18
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:36:18
DIANA FOSHA Um...who was a child's therapist, and I was talking to her about it, and how the kids were affected by 9/11, and what she said to me was very interesting and, sort of, bears on this. She said...um...it all depended on the parents. 

00:36:38
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:36:38
DIANA FOSHA Thta those kids who had...parents who supported them through all of the scary stuff. 

00:36:48
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:36:48
DIANA FOSHA However frightening, clearly, it doesn't get bigger T than that. 

00:36:48
RICH SIMON Uh huh. Right. 

00:36:53
DIANA FOSHA Um...were okay. 

00:36:53
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:36:53
DIANA FOSHA And had, ya know, all of the news reels on TV and everything that had happened, never the less, that they were okay. They may...not mini... where as, the kids were really having trouble. 

00:37:08
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:37:08
DIANA FOSHA Where the kids, ya know, where the parental relationship had failed them, and they had found themselves a little low with these absolutely terrifying feelings, and their parents were having difficulty. 

00:37:23
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:37:23
DIANA FOSHA Um...Right? That is really, and that, sort of just, fundamental understanding of attachment, and, ya know, there's so many people who are writing so (ph)cogently about it, from bold beyond, but a lot of people now who basic-, you know, like, the parent is there to scaffold and to support and to really help the child... 

00:37:48
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:37:53
DIANA FOSHA ...Through all of the messy, horrible, terrible... feelings or overwhelming feelings, sometimes even in positive. 

00:37:58
RICH SIMON Yeah. Uh huh. 

00:37:58
DIANA FOSHA You know, is there to help the kid regulate. 

00:38:03
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:38:03
DIANA FOSHA So that, in a way, you don't get overwhelmed by your emotions. 

00:38:08
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:38:08
DIANA FOSHA Or... you're able to have support, and so, that really, fundamental to this understanding of trauma, is that...w-, ya know... that one is alone, I mean, trauma, right by definition, is one's resources are inadequate to the situation. 

00:38:28
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:38:28
DIANA FOSHA But, without support... 

00:38:33
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:38:33
DIANA FOSHA If you have, right, Harlow's monkeys, even the ones who were deprived of mothers... 

00:38:38
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:38:38
DIANA FOSHA They had buddies, and if they had buddies... 

00:38:43
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:38:43
DIANA FOSHA They did better than if they were totally alone and handling the isolation, and some of these are very, very similar to that, so that's so many of the people who we end up seeing, and again, this is not just Big T trauma, but it can be the Small T trauma... 

00:38:58
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:38:58
DIANA FOSHA Have this experience of being really, really overwhelmed to begin with, and then alone in the face of something that is, like, beyond them. Too much grief, or too much fear; too much terror... 

00:39:13
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:39:18
DIANA FOSHA ...Without the, anybody there to support, number one, to hold, number two, but also the parent who...engenders secure attachment, sort of, is able to, sort of be with a kid through... 

00:39:43
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:39:43
DIANA FOSHA The motion...and then out the other side...um... 

00:39:48
RICH SIMON S-, so, i-, it seems like, a-, as you're, uh, I, I'm just really getting...uh, a picture, how you work, how you think about yourself...as a therapist and what you're offering clients. So you, I, I, I, the contrast is... I come in, I'm a, there's a cognitively oriented therapist, or somebody who is versed in mindfulness techniques, um, disregulate. They teach me how, how to breathe deeply, how to get a felt sense of my body. They teach me how to improve my capacity for self soothing, I can go out of it, I'm taking these skills out of the office. Still, that's one perfectly legitimate way of work and lots of us work in that way. 

00:40:33
DIANA FOSHA That's marvelous and, ya know, that, that are marvelous, but that are part impartial of what I do as well. Right. 

00:40:38
RICH SIMON But, but you're all, i-, in addition to that, a-, and you, you may well do that, and apparently you do that, an-, and I'm sure that most people listening to this do in some way, but you're doing something where you're, um, where you're explicitly challenging my sense of aloneness. 

00:40:58
DIANA FOSHA Yes. 

00:40:58
RICH SIMON You're inviting me into a relationship with you. So, this, this word, somehow, seems very charged, this whole thing of the, of the, uh, pain of aloneness seems to be something that you're, this way of working that you're discussing, at least at the moment, is... 

00:41:13
DIANA FOSHA Right. Right. 

00:41:13
RICH SIMON Very directly, i-, is, does that fit for you? Is that how you think of yourself in, as a therapist? 

00:41:18
DIANA FOSHA Absolutely. 

00:41:23
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:41:23
DIANA FOSHA Absolutely, and, ya know, I'm doing aloneness, and really.... 

00:41:28
RICH SIMON Yeah. Doing aloneness. That's, that's a good one. 

00:41:28
DIANA FOSHA Working... 

00:41:28
RICH SIMON Uh huh. Go ahead. 

00:41:28
DIANA FOSHA I, I'm sorry? Yeah. 

00:41:33
RICH SIMON No no! I'm saying I'm doing aloneness. I, I resonate with that. So, so, a-, and so, e-, expand this for us. So, in terms of w-, whatever you wanna say about it, how is, how was your, how are you undoing a, aloneness, in, in, is, uh, is there some other things that you want to exphasize about this kind of, way of working. You're slowing it down; you're bringing me into the moment. You're inviting me to make explicit, my experience of you at this moment in my relationship with you. You're celebrating with me, not just the, my pain, but the, my triumphs is the...let's talk a little bit more about how you, how you work at that. 

00:42:08
DIANA FOSHA Um...yeah, I think there's all that great summary, I'm trying to think about it. 

00:42:18
RICH SIMON You're a great therapist! I'm feeling healed already, Diane! I feel less alone! 

00:42:23
DIANA FOSHA It's because we had a little time! 

00:42:28
RICH SIMON A little time with each other. That's right! 

00:42:28
DIANA FOSHA Right! Um... that...a couple of things. We-, this I, I ha-, gotta remember what I had wanted to say is that many people, right, are actually able to, over time, um, develop good relationships with their therapist so that if you ask them, right? If you do a psychotherapy alliance research, I, you know, like, yes I think my therapist cares about me and is warm and supportive, and so on and so forth. 

00:43:08
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:43:08
DIANA FOSHA Uh, or, um, ya know, many people actually, sort of, end up having these, sort of, implicit moments that we're talking about, but who's internal working models remain, or their ideals about themselves and how they relate, remain based on the old stuff. So, even though we had a nice moment... 

00:43:33
RICH SIMON Uh huh. Uh huh. Yeah. 

00:43:33
DIANA FOSHA Um, then by the time you walk out of the office, ya know, you sort of zip up, both the jacket and emotionally. 

00:43:43
RICH SIMON Uh huh. Emotionally. 

00:43:43
DIANA FOSHA And, still think I'm a lone wolf, and...ya know, people don't touch me...or nobody wants to have anything to do with me, or whatever. 

00:43:53
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:43:53
DIANA FOSHA So that, in a way, when it stays in implicit, in some ways it works...ya know, it becomes the motor of the therapy. It allows things to happen, but there's another way in which it is very attachment trauma, or relationship trauma that we started by talking about. 

00:44:13
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:44:13
DIANA FOSHA That doesn't, the internal working model doesn't change. How one sort of sees one's self relative to other people doesn't really change, so that's why I take very small bits. 

00:44:23
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:44:23
DIANA FOSHA All right? Cuz if you...take big bits...then the whole thing, sort of, short circuits. 

00:44:33
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:44:33
DIANA FOSHA But take little bits, like a little smile, like a high five, like a, "Hm, that takes a lot of courage," or...whatever. 

00:44:38
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:44:43
DIANA FOSHA Um...and start to have the person have experience of what it actually feels like to be connected. Of what it actually, number one, that they are. 

00:44:58
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:44:58
DIANA FOSHA That's the part... and number two, like, "Okay, so, what does that feel like?" And sometimes it feels good and sometimes it feels bad. You know? 

00:45:08
RICH SIMON Uh huh. Yeah. 

00:45:08
DIANA FOSHA And, and if it feels good, fantastic. 

00:45:13
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:45:13
DIANA FOSHA Then we need more resources, and if it feels bad, that's useful too, because the old stuff, like for the woman, uh, I, I described, is getting picked up. 

00:45:23
RICH SIMON So the, this microprosessing and this putting into the language, rather than leaving it implicit, your view is that it helps people to transfer. It helps people to take something out of the office, that the experience in and of itself, however warming, a-, or soothing it is...wouldn't allow them to do. 

00:45:43
DIANA FOSHA Might not, right? And I think that we, sort of know something about, um, ya know, how trauma affects the transfer of information between the hemispheres. 

00:45:58
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:45:58
DIANA FOSHA So, and in a way, you have to work a little harder, with people with traumatic histories to make sure...that it crosses over. So, even though I'd be a more failed sense, a more right-brained experience in something. 

00:46:13
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:46:13
DIANA FOSHA If you don't put it into words, that kind of block... 

00:46:18
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:46:18
DIANA FOSHA Remains. 

00:46:23
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:46:23
DIANA FOSHA And then they come in the next session, as though nothing happened. 

00:46:28
RICH SIMON Yeah...yeah. 

00:46:28
DIANA FOSHA All right? So, it's sort of like trying to activate as many channels as possible. What does it feel like in your body? What do you feel in your face? What do you see on my face? What are the words for it? What do you think about it? Right? So, if you're hitting enough of all of these different channels, it's more likely... to stick, a little bit longer...in the face of all of the old habits and old ways of keeping safe, which is like . 

00:46:58
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:46:58
DIANA FOSHA I'm not doin' that! 

00:46:58
RICH SIMON Yeah. Ah. 

00:47:03
DIANA FOSHA So, so that's one piece of it, one big piece of, sort of, how I think about it. 

00:47:08
RICH SIMON So here's the other, another piece, from the point of view from the, the care and maintenance of the therapist. This sounds like an extremely demanding way to do psychotherapy. You're putting yourself on the line; you're, I, ya know, you, what do you see on my face? Oh, let me look at her face. How do, how does it feel for you, being with me right now? Oh my! So the, that amps this up. How, i-, it, how does it, uh, it's th-, that seems to me like that's a much more demanding way of working with people, and so, how do ya, how do ya sustain that? You can, can y-, how many, how many, uh, can you see three or four clients back to back, working in the way you're describing? 

00:47:53
DIANA FOSHA Well, it is more demanding, but it's also more vitalizing. 

00:47:58
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:47:58
DIANA FOSHA It's just more vitalizing. 

00:48:03
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:48:03
DIANA FOSHA Ya know, and I think particularly, if you have the tools and, ya know, in the beginning, ya know, th-, now I'm talking about also training therapists, it is a lot. It is a lot, and it also is a lot because before what we were talking about, it, sort of, kicks off this like, unwanted stuff for the patient. All of a sudden, we're having a little high five, next moment it's just weeping about never having had a mother. 

00:48:23
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:48:28
DIANA FOSHA It does the same thing for the therapist, so I think, in that way... 

00:48:28
RICH SIMON Yeah? 

00:48:28
DIANA FOSHA It really requires a fair amount of self- care cuz otherwise, you're gonna wanna hide, or not be there. 

00:48:38
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:48:38
DIANA FOSHA But, at the same time, at least for me, and in a way, people have to know who they are, I mean, have to know something about themselves and (ph)time, right? For me, these are such alive moments, and it's so... like...ah...yeah! It's, ya know, I get a headache if nothing is happening. 

00:49:03
RICH SIMON Uh huh. Right. 

00:49:03
DIANA FOSHA Like... there's distance ande, a lot of...whatever. That's a, that's more draining. 

00:49:13
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah. 

00:49:13
DIANA FOSHA Um, when you don't connect. When...it, sort of, stays in that place. There's something, you know, that's very, very alive...and it feels like, it's delicious! I mean, delicious is sometimes is delicious, and sometimes it's many other things, but it's engaging. It's enlivening. It's great. 

00:49:33
RICH SIMON Right... and energizing and also, you, you, you and it seems like a big part of this, whatever self-awareness certainly seems like a huge element here, but also there's, it's sort of a tempermental quality. 

00:49:43
DIANA FOSHA Yeah. 

00:49:43
RICH SIMON This is not a psychotherapy for, uh, the, uh, the terminally introverted. 

00:49:53
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:49:53
RICH SIMON This is not, cuz these two words, there's just something, I mean, there's a particular essence and as we're talking here for me, about... hiding and aloneness. This is not a therapy uh, or, if you're committed to hiding, or you want to be alone in the world, and that's a safe course in life. This is a way of being in relationship that is deeply challenging to both of those, for both the therapist and the client. 

00:50:18
DIANA FOSHA It's very true. That's very true. Ya know, and it sometimes, yeah. 

00:50:23
RICH SIMON So, i-, it, k-, ke-, uh, w-, what were you gonna say? 

00:50:28
DIANA FOSHA Ya know, what I was gonna say is I also, um, ya know, when I teach, I teach from video tapes, so I show these tapes. 

00:50:38
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:50:38
DIANA FOSHA Um...of these encounters. 

00:50:43
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:50:43
DIANA FOSHA And they sometimes, sort of, like, awake these yearnings. I mean, I'm...ya know...in, uh...in people who tend to hide or to avoid. 

00:50:58
RICH SIMON I would think so! Absolutely. So you have your trainees, so you have your trainees there, and people get very emotional as their watching a session, and in addition to whatever's going on in the room, by people just watching it, it taps into something in them. Yeah. That makes sense. 

00:51:13
DIANA FOSHA Yeah, absolutely...and I try to work with that when training therapists. 

00:51:18
RICH SIMON Well, talk about that cuz that seems like, yeah, I think that's what I'm asking, so this is, uh, it's one thing to, to learn a cognitive behavioral protocol, or, to, (ph)help become, I don't know, more mindful or pay attention, y-, ya know, what's going on in your body right now and all. So many of the things that we do can by very, very helpful to people, but what you're describing is, um, seems to make additional demands on the therapist, so tell us a little bit about how do, how do you prepare people for, uh, this, this is a career. This is a, uh, style of relationship day in day out with their clients. 

00:51:53
DIANA FOSHA Yeah, I mean, I think in the training or in supervision, it's a bit of parallel process of trying to create...as much safety as possible, from the, kinda, high risk that it is, right? I mean, it's very different also. It's not just learning. It's different to learn a protocol than to, sort of, throw yourself in these kinds of moments. It's also, um... ya know, it's also very different. It just, sort of, comes to supervision...and pop, you know...and sh-, pop in, that, that dates me from video tape time. 

00:52:33
RICH SIMON Yeah. Well that's technologically adeptual. We've, we've practiced schedule is giving you... 

00:52:38
DIANA FOSHA It, sort of, click on...I feel like that. I feel... 

00:52:43
RICH SIMON T-, take you behind the scenes at the Networker, here. I think the sixth time that we've, we've tried to get together to have this conversation. I'm sorry. Go ahead. 

00:52:53
DIANA FOSHA At the very least, right? 

00:52:53
RICH SIMON Very true. 

00:52:53
DIANA FOSHA So, ya know, pop something in, you (ph)hit play, and what we're working from is incredibly exposing, that rather that coming in to your supervisor or your teacher, I did this, and this is what happened, and what would you advise, and you have an active discussion. 

00:53:13
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:53:13
DIANA FOSHA You look, and there you, you the therapist, or there I am...for better or worse, totally exposed. Not so much through the control that I have through telling you a story, well, now I do, but, um, it will work looking at my video tapes we wouldn't be. 

00:53:33
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:53:33
DIANA FOSHA Ya know, so that...similarly, so I'm found of telling this story. When I was teaching this to a group of graduate students, ya know, were, and they were just beginning to, sort of show their tapes at the beginning of the year, when it was all very new. Um, people forgot to turn on the camera, the sound didn't work. 

00:53:58
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:53:58
DIANA FOSHA Um...would still video tape, but sort of, from like the chest down and you wouldn't see the head of, ya know, all of these happens. 

00:54:03
RICH SIMON All this stuff. Right. Sure. 

00:54:03
DIANA FOSHA All this kind of stuff, right? which was really just the anxiety around the exposure. 

00:54:08
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:54:13
DIANA FOSHA But then, as the year proceeded, ya know, and then if they chose, they chose moments that were they looked good, ya know? 

00:54:18
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:54:23
DIANA FOSHA Ya know, by the time this proceeded, the opportunity to really have somebody witness what you're really experiencing, including all of the places that are so difficult and you don't know what you're doing, and you're at a loss, or ashamed, or anxious, or you've gotten triggered, or all of a sudden, a friend of mine calls it guppy moments when I, you try to say something, and nothing's coming out. 

00:54:48
RICH SIMON Yes. 

00:54:48
DIANA FOSHA Right? Um...which we all experience all the time, right? Cuz like, the opportunity to not, just, sort of, be along with it and feel ashamed of what a horrible therapist you are, but instead have a safe place where you can say, "Oh my gosh! Ya know, I had the session, and I had no idea. I really didn't know what to do. I was at such a loss," or, "I got triggered," or, "All of a sudden, I forgot everything I knew," and look...um...so, in that way, it's a parallel of process that, with enough trust, um... then it's, the, the yearning to share and have something really real happen, so you can do something about it. It starts to operate, is really what we're trying to foster, ya know, in the training...um, as well, yes, it's high stakes, but then the opportunity of something being real, um... 

00:55:48
RICH SIMON So, i-, in, we have about five minutes here. So, le-, let's focus here a little bit, because I think you've, you've communicated really very powerfully...the experience, both for the therapist and for the, th-, the client, and in this kind of thing, uh, where this, uh, uh, this theraputic challenge to aloneness; this invitation to come out of one. So these words of yearning and hiding, I mean, uh, uh, uh, they really, uh, seem to resonate very strongly, uh, a-, as you're describing this. What's the skill that enables a therapist? What, as a trainee of yours, what, what do I learn? That sounds like a tall order this kind of therapy that we're describing here. Ya know... 

00:56:33
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:56:33
RICH SIMON To expose the, the, the, the least, they, ya know, there's a reason we, why many of us spend a lot of our time alone that we're hiding, and so you're exposing... 

00:56:43
DIANA FOSHA Right. 

00:56:43
RICH SIMON What's the skill that you're teaching your trainees that enables them to be able to help people in this kind, oh, by offering them this kind of relationship? 

00:56:53
DIANA FOSHA Um, I think one... is not just tracking, right, developing, and this is where video tape or the image, the actual visual record helps. You can go back to it 10 times. 

00:57:08
RICH SIMON Ten times over. 

00:57:08
DIANA FOSHA Okay? So, like, what you miss the first time, or the first three times, you start to develop a sensitivity...um...to these minute fluctuations, all right, and so that's something about learning how to track and be enabled to work with video tape is incredibly, incredibly useful cuz you can just play it over and over and you're not having the anxiety of being in the interaction. 

00:57:38
RICH SIMON Yeah. Uh huh. 

00:57:38
DIANA FOSHA So that's one piece of it. 

00:57:43
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:57:43
DIANA FOSHA Another piece of it is... and, you know, is really, it's a big, fancy word, which had, which is phenomenology, but learning to tell the qualities of productive emotions...versus the qualities of these emotions which will get you into the trauma vortex, or they're more about lax, or, um, you know, they're emotions that appear engaged, but...right? So that we have just a very, very careful phenomenology or emotional and relational experience. That, in a way, gives you a map, like, it's not all happening for the first time. You have some sense of how other people have handled it. 

00:58:38
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:58:38
DIANA FOSHA And if you see this, then, okay, that's a cue that you really can go. Take a risk. Go for this. 

00:58:43
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:58:43
DIANA FOSHA But, if you're seeing this kind of affect or this kind of an interaction, that's actually a cue. There's not enough safety or...in the room. So, work on safety that, whateve-, even though you think you're brilliant. Ya know, like, your patient has just left the room, so, you might... 

00:59:08
RICH SIMON Don't go there. 

00:59:08
DIANA FOSHA Right? So, don't go there and not just using one's intuition, but actually learning to look and categorize and classify. So that's, you know, one aspect of it. 

00:59:18
RICH SIMON Uh huh. Okay. 

00:59:18
DIANA FOSHA The other has to, I think might, um, the analogy that I'm fond of using, even though I don't play a musical instrument, is like learning to play a musical instrument. You put in all that work, sort of, practicing skills and scales, all, so that when you're actually, so whatever feeling you have for the music or whatever talent you have, if you've practiced enough... 

00:59:48
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:59:48
DIANA FOSHA ...Then something spontaneous can happen when you're actually working because you've built a map, or, you have muscle memory of what it is. 

00:59:58
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

00:59:58
DIANA FOSHA So you're not focusing on what do I do now. 

01:00:03
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

01:00:03
DIANA FOSHA But something about these processes that can be very powerful... number one, you can activate it and let it go, but number two, you know something about what to do with it so it doesn't become a run away train, or... 

01:00:18
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah. 

01:00:18
DIANA FOSHA I'm using a lot of mixed metaphors here, but... 

01:00:23
RICH SIMON Yep. Uh huh. We-, well, it's like the, you're approach to helping people transfer their...their learning outside the treatment room. Now, they'll have something to take home with them. 

01:00:33
DIANA FOSHA Yeah, so, you just did an ADP intervention, right? You took something you were passionate about... 

01:00:38
RICH SIMON Oh, okay! I study, but, I study, but, I do. 

01:00:43
DIANA FOSHA So, that's another example of it. 

01:00:43
RICH SIMON Wait, what did I do, i-, is always my AD, a-, and tell people what ADP, well, I didn't, how... 

01:00:48
DIANA FOSHA ADP 

01:00:53
RICH SIMON I have trouble with acronyms, so, I, I know it's an acronym, so I know ADP, but I couldn't remember. 

01:00:53
DIANA FOSHA That's okay! 

01:00:53
RICH SIMON What it stands for, so why don't you make sure people know what your model is. 

01:00:58
DIANA FOSHA Okay. 

01:00:58
RICH SIMON ADA? 

01:01:03
DIANA FOSHA A.E.D.P. Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy. 

01:01:08
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:01:08
DIANA FOSHA So you just did an AEDP intervention. Here, us feeling a little flustered; oh my God, I became self-conscious that I was using mixed metaphors. 

01:01:18
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:01:18
DIANA FOSHA And you said to me, no! It's not something to feel bad about! It's actually something great because I'm giving people five metaphors. They'll cross over the right to the, etcetera. So... 

01:01:28
RICH SIMON Okay. Okay. I see. 

01:01:28
DIANA FOSHA Thank you. 

01:01:28
RICH SIMON All right, well, l-, let me end the interview on a high point for me! I, I've gotten a gold star from the therapist. THat's terrific! 

01:01:38
DIANA FOSHA You have. You have. Thank you. 

01:01:38
RICH SIMON We're almost out of time here, so, say a little bit...so people who are interested, I mean, you, you've really, uh, you've really made this, uh, come so vividly to life, here. People who are interested in finding more about your work, and training experiences or, or, or reading your stuff, uh, wh-, where do we go? 

01:01:58
DIANA FOSHA wwwaedpinstitute.com. aedpinstitute, one word, .com, and that's our, the website for this approach. There are a ton of papers that you can download for free...a bunch of trainings that are actually happening in 2012. 

01:02:18
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:02:18
DIANA FOSHA Um...[01:02;35]I'm gonna do a big emersion course in Vancouver, another one in Boston. Um... 

01:02:28
RICH SIMON When are these? 

01:02:33
DIANA FOSHA Rather, some presentations. 

01:02:33
RICH SIMON Wh-, wh-, when are these, Diana? Are they coming up, uh, in the Spring? 

01:02:38
DIANA FOSHA The, the Boston Emersion course is going to be in July, I don't have the exact dates. 

01:02:43
RICH SIMON Okay. Okay. 

01:02:43
DIANA FOSHA But they're on the website and maybe I'll send you some materials about the days for Vancouver have not have not been set. 

01:02:53
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:02:53
DIANA FOSHA And there's just a number of presentations coming up that are on the website, so... 

01:02:58
RICH SIMON If there's a, uh, single... 

01:02:58
DIANA FOSHA And I do go into one about AEDP with men. 

01:03:03
RICH SIMON Okay. All right. All right, we, we could use it. Um, along with, uh, with the rest of your (ph)vanity. 

01:03:08
DIANA FOSHA Yeah. 

01:03:08
RICH SIMON Um, so, if there's one thing, a-, an-, and, people can get this if you go to the, uh, uh, those of you who are, um, on the enhanced track, if you go to the fulfillment page, you'll have a del-, uh, a link directing to Diana's site. If there's one place that people can go, is there something that you've written, that you wanted to point out to them? Is this really a place to, uh, to start. Uh, is there, uh, a particular paper, or a chapter, whatever you've written. What would that be? 

01:03:38
DIANA FOSHA Uh, well one is, there's a book, which I think of as AEDP from suit to not. 

01:03:43
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:03:43
DIANA FOSHA Um, it's called The Transforming Power of Affect. 

01:03:48
RICH SIMON Uh huh. Okay. 

01:03:48
DIANA FOSHA And that's Basic Books, 2000. Um... and...another...paper is actually in a book that...um...I edited, that...edited with Dan Segal and Marian Solomon. 

01:04:08
RICH SIMON Okay. Yeah. Yeah. 

01:04:08
DIANA FOSHA It's called The Healing Power of Emotion. 

01:04:13
RICH SIMON Uh huh. 

01:04:13
DIANA FOSHA And, I have a chapter in it where I talk a lot about metaprocessing, this kind of, metatheraputic processing we spoke a lot about, and this kind of really staying in the relationship, and tracking it very closely and working with it experientially, so I think that chapter would probably be one that contains a lot. 

01:04:38
RICH SIMON Okay. Great. Uh huh. 

01:04:38
DIANA FOSHA This integrated information! 

01:04:43
RICH SIMON All right. So, we're just about out of time. Here's, last thing, again, I want to remind people, um, let the conversation continue, uh, the comment board on the, uh, o-, on your screen, here. We're really inviting you to, uh...an-, and, uh, wh-, what could be a more inviting presentation as far as sharing. Get out of your aloneness! Share your experience with other people who share the experience, uh, the very delightful experience of listening to Diana, here, this afternoon. So, an-, and she's, she wi-, that will look at your comments, and as always, as appropriate, th-, there's no guarantee of an encyclopedia being written as a response, but, y-, i-, if, whatever your thoughts are, your questions, connections you're making between what you heard and other theories in the field, whatever happens to be shared with the group, Diana has very graciously agreed to read the comments and respond where, where as so moved, and where appropriate. Diana, what a pleasure! Thank you so much! I, I feel less alone and more present than when we started. 

01:05:48
DIANA FOSHA As do I! Thank you so much! It was just a lovely, lovely conversation, and dialogue, and an opportunity to share the work that I love, so thank you. You've been, just a delightful interviewer, so... 

01:05:58
