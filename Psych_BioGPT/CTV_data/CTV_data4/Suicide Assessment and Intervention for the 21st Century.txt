THERAPY Talks John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. 

00:01:45
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So this is a difficult topic, Suicide Assessment and Intervention, ah, with suicidal clients, very stressful but ironically it's also a topic that I feel quite happy when I present on. And I think the reason I feel so happy presenting about it is because it's important, it's highly stressful for practitioners and therefore it feels very meaningful but then when I get in to a topic a little bit more I recognize how difficult it is and challenging it is. I remember, uhm, a therapist friend of mine, I was doing a public presentation and he left in the middle of my suicide talk and afterwards saw me it was just hitting too close to home. And so he needed to, to get away. And so, as you listen, I hope that you engage in some self-care. I hope you talk to some colleagues and friends because when we're engaging ourselves in this kind of a topic we, we need support and we should not be isolated. Uhm, and so to confess, to be honest I would say I don't really like talking about suicide but I believe it's so important that we speak directly to each other and with our clients about suicide. So here we go. A little bit about suicide statistics. Uhm, suicide, completed suicide is really fairly rare event. Uhm, usually only about one in 10,000 Americans commit suicide each year and yet it's also a big social problem and that's, ah, it affects many people probably almost everyone and you may be familiar with some of the famous suicides. 

00:03:25
The Problems of Suicide 

00:03:30
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Prime examples including Marilyn Monroe and Kurt Cobain. But maybe even more importantly is the issue of suicide attempts. About 10% of the human population has made a suicide attempt and so that means that most people do not die by suicide and move on and live, ah, fairly happy and meaningful life despite having-- have a suicide attempt. And somewhere around 20% of adults report struggling with suicidal thoughts, sometimes called ideations in the professional literature and suicidal impulses. And in surveys of high school students we find about 50% say that they have fought about suicide. 

00:04:15
Suicide Facts • Suicide completion is infrequent • But suicide attempts are not infrequent • And suicide ideation (thoughts) are common • This makes suicide prediction very difficult, but suicide prevention very necessary 

00:04:15
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So really, although suicide-- completed suicide is very infrequent. Suicide ideation is, is fairly common and so it's really hard to predict suicide and yet, ah, it's very important for us to focus on the prevention and intervention about suicide. In 1991, I was working with, ah, young man and he ended up committing suicide. It's a terrible tragedy, ah, I felt that gut reaching-- wrenching guilt and regrets, uhm, that stays with you for a long time. And right afterwards I met with my professionals supervision group and they quiz me and they, ah, declared that I had in fact done all the usual and customary suicidal assessment and intervention procedures. And, ah, that, that was reassuring but in my heart, in my mind, ah, I knew then, I still know now that I could have done better. 

00:05:15
John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. The Big Suicide Myth Suicide ideation and gestures are signs of DEVIANCE 

00:05:20
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You see back in 1991, uhm, we were really living by the medical model of suicide assessment and intervention. And that particular model emphasize that suicidal thoughts and impulses were deviance, were psychopathology. And consequently the role of the professional was to assess and intervene and eliminate the suicidal thoughts and impulses. As it turns out, there are some problems with that way of thinking about suicide oftentimes the professional then creates distance between himself or herself and the client by taking that kind of medical model approach. In addition it kind of disempowers clients. And finally, it really contributes to them feeling like they're a little bit crazy because we are considering ideation, thoughts of suicide which again may occur in up to 50% of teenagers as a sign of psychopathology and so, this is a bad myth. It's a big myth and it's ha-- it's a hard one to shake, uhm, but I would like right now for us to put that myth to rest, put it behind us. No longer think of suicide ideation and impulses as something that's a sign of deviance or abnormality. 

00:06:45
Busting the Big Myth Suicide thoughts and gestures are normal signs of DISTRESS This is the NEW REALITY 

00:06:45
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And instead have a new way of thinking about it, a new reality. That really says, suicidal thoughts and impulses are a normal expression of human distress for some people. Another implication of that new reality is that we as professionals don't need to freak out. In fact, talking about suicide should be a regular part of our practice. We shouldn't be worried that, "Oh, no, may be my next client will talk about suicide." We should be much more prepared to engage and have conversations about it. 

00:07:20
Traditional vs. Postmodern Suicide Assessment and Intervention Old Narrative: We look for pathology and emphasize diagnostic interviewing and no-suicide contracts New Narrative: We look for strengths, normalize suicide ideation, and initiate collaborative safety planning 

00:07:25
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So let's briefly contrast what is the old traditional suicide assessment intervention model with what would be called the contemporary or postmodern model. The old model of course is all about risk factors, diagnostic assessment and establishing a no suicide contract. We used to get out a piece of paper and say, you need to sign here where it says I promise not to commit suicide on purpose of accidentally. Now, the new narrative focuses more on protective factors, focuses on client strengths and it, it normalizes suicide ideation so that we are saying to client, it's not unusual for someone whose experiencing what you're experiencing to actually have some thoughts of suicide, that's okay. And also we initiate a collaborative safety plan instead of a no suicide contract, I'll talk about that a bit more as we go. So this is what I wish I had understood back in 1991. I wish that, uhm, I could have been, uhm, a little bit more focusing on the positive and I think this is what I should have done. I think this is really what all mental health professionals need to be doing now, focusing more on the positive with my client on strengths, and protective factors instead of risk factors. 

00:08:40
Suicide Interview Components 1. Explore suicide risk AND PROTECTIVE factors 2. Collaboratively and courageously explore what increases and decreases suicidal intensity, frequency, and duration 3. Evaluate the suicide plan in the context of client self-control and intent to help determine level of care needed 4. Collaborate with client on safety planning and other suicide interventions 

00:08:40
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And really si-- sitting down and engaging in an intimate conversation with him about, ah, you know, "What are your reasons for living? What are the--" and, and the, the scary thing about that is sometimes clients will say, "I have no reasons for living." But that's okay, that's part of the engagement and the deeper collaborative process that we do now and I think is a much better approach than the medical model. I should have emphasized that he was having normal thoughts and not have been quite so anxious myself about the fact that he was thinking about suicide and that he even had a plan. I wish that I had, uhm, done a better job of talking with him about controlling his impulses when and if they came up on him. I wish that I had asked him so who would you call? And what if that person is not available who would you call next? And who would you want with you and why? What makes that relationship a safe one? And I wish I had gone into greater detail and all of those kind of positive and protective, ah, parts of suicide assessment and intervention. I also should have used a little more solution focused postmodern kinds of questions, things like , "So, what are you doing when the suicide symptoms are gone? What are you doing when your depression is gone? What's happening then?" Those kind of exception questions. I wish I had asked him more about his hopes for today and tomorrow and into the future. 

00:10:10
Balance Your Questioning Traditional suicide assessment and depression assessment focuses on asking about risk factors and depressive symptoms We should balance this with positive questions about protective factors (reasons for living), hope, and positive behaviors: What's happening when you feel happy or joyful? What helps you concentrate? 

00:10:10
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN The old suicide model focuses a lot on hopelessness. I wish I had focused more on hopes. I wish that I had talk with him a little about what brings light into the darkness for him? And I wish I had brainstorm with him about what are the practical things that he could during those nights or mornings, or whenever, ah, to bring a little bit more light into the darkness. And so, one of the biggest changes of all when it comes to doing, ah, suicide interventions is that we no longer do that no suicide contract instead we do a collaborative safety plan. And that can involve all those things I was already talking about, ah, as, as well as a message to the clients like, "I want you to live." 

00:11:00
John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. 

00:11:00
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Now, that's different in arguing with a client about whether they should or whether it's moral to commit suicide. I want you to live is a self-disclosure. It's unarguable because of that and it's also a clear message to the client that you wanna be of help. The problem-- one of the problems with the old contracts was that some of the clients actually or the patients would feel like that the purpose of that contract was more to protect the counselor or the psychotherapist, or the psychiatrist than it was to protect the client and that's backwards. We certainly don't wanna give that message. And so no suicide contracts, they are out. Collaborative safety plans are in that is part of the new reality. Now, I told you with the 1991 tragedy but I also wanna tell you a better story with a happy ending and I know, maybe I have blown it by telling you there's a happy ending, oh, well. When you're doing a talk on suicide it's okay for everybody know I've got a story with a happy ending. So, a number of years ago around five o'clock in the evening I got a call from an agency across the street. And it was, ah, alcohol and, ah, drug prevention agency and they called me and said, "We have a 16-year-old young woman who has walked into our offices and she's suicidal and we have no helping professionals on our staff, could you come over?" I went over. I sat down with her in their lobby, I started talking with her. She said to me that she had run away from the local psychiatric hospital that she was on her way to a bridge about a quarter mile away and that she planned to jump off of that bridge to kill herself. She was pretty adamant about it that was really her plan. 

00:12:50
Two Brief Suicide Interventions A Suicide Story 1. Explore alternatives to suicide 2. Neodissociation And be genuine John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. 

00:12:50
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uhm, and so I started to use a suicide intervention and it's an intervention called Alternative to Suicide and it's one that was articulated by Edwin Shneidman years ago who is well-known as the Father of Suicidology here in the US. And so I pulled out a piece of paper and I wrote down kill yourself in the left-hand column. And I said that's one option, that's what you're saying you'd like to do. I just wanna come up with some other alternatives. So I began coming up with other alternatives cuz she didn't contribute any. I said, "Well, you know, you could just go back to the hospital." She said, "No way." I said, "Well, you could get some family therapy." She said, "I'm not getting family therapy." And I said, "Well, that's okay. I'm gonna write these down anyway because we're just making a list and you don't have to do any of the things on this list. All we're doing is making a list." So I generated about eight different options and then I did what Shneidman recommends because the purpose of this intervention is to help clients, suicidal clients with a thing that's called mental constriction. Mental constriction is sort of like having blinders on and all I can see is the continuation of my life as a miserable human being or the termination of my life. And that's all the person can see, continuing to be miserable or killing herself or himself. So I pushed the sheet of paper in front of her and I say, "Hey, I'd like you to just rank order your preference. The order in which you would like to do these different things." She followed my directions, hands me back the, the list and somewhat surprisingly kill myself is number three on the list. I'm thrilled, I go right after it. She immediately escalates heads out the door. I say, "I'm coming with you." I go out the door, I walk alongside her and I try to lead her back around to the office where we were and she says, "I know you're trying to take me back there." And I said, "Of course I'm trying to take you back there, that's what this is all about. I want you to live." And we kept going and she got down to a corner where we had to cross a street to get to the bridge. And, ah, I decided I needed to stop there so I did and I said, "I'm stopping here." In my mind, I'm thinking I'm running across the street to call 911. I don't wanna get on the bridge with her, it just seem like bad things will happen. And then I reached out and I grabbed her hand and she pulled back and she yelled at me, she said, "You should have not done that, you should not touched me." And I said, "You're totally right. I am so sorry, I absolutely should not have touched you." 

00:15:30
Two Brief Suicide Interventions A Suicide Story 1. Explore alternatives to suicide 2. Neodissociation And be genuine 

00:15:30
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And then I did the second suicide intervention. I used the Neodissociation technique. And I said, "Held at my hand," I said, "I know a part of you wants to stay alive and live a healthy happy life, and so I would just love it if that part of you would reach out and take my hand and come back with me to the office so we can get you the help that you deserve." Somewhat to my surprise, she took my hand, we walk hand and hand back to the office. We called the police, she went to the hospital. Big relief. Two months later I get a card from her, it says, "Dr. John, thank you for helping me. The only bridges in my life now are bridges to health and happiness." Wow, that's great but that's not the end. I contacted a therapist about 6 months later because I wanted to get her feedback on what was helpful, what made her-- what help her make the decision to live? The therapist said sure. She came to my office, I did a little video interview of her. And I remember, I asked her in general. She said, "You know, when I went back to the hospital there are-- staff was mostly a bunch of robots but I had one student nurse and the word she used was she said, 'who is fresh,' she was fresh and genuine and she helped me a lot." And I said, "What about when were on the bridge or when we were close to the bridge?" And I and-- what helped then? And she says, "I don't know. You know, I got really excited." I said, "Okay." 

00:17:00
John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. 

00:17:00
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Was it the Neodissociation technique and I described it to her and she said, "Oh, no that was stupid." It was the corniest thing ever, and then she paused and say, "Spontaneously you know, I think what it was, was when you stopped and you started talking it just seemed like the look on your face was that you really cared and so then I decided to come with you because it seemed like you really cared." And so that is the suicide story that I prefer to remember and speaking of remembering let's just go over very quickly the main points. I call these the New Mantra or the new way of thinking about suicide assessment and intervention. 

00:17:40
The New Mantra Normalize Collaborate Focus on Strengths Consult and Document 

00:17:40
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN The first one is there's no more a big myth. Suicide ideation and impulses those are normal human expressions of distress. Number two, collaborate, collaborative safety plan get in there and work hard and intimately with your client about how to embrace life. Number three, balance the risk assessment. We need to do that with an assessment of protective factors and clients strengths. And of course although they are only three, the fourth one is just the standard thing, be sure to consult and document. Now, I wanna end, I have a final photo, uhm, of my daughters and they're doing sort of a bizarre human behavior. You can probably see the one daughter is giving the other daughter what I like to think of is a pit check. And I think that sort of a metaphor for what we should all do with each other when it comes to working with clients who have suicidal thoughts and impulses. We need to check in. We need to check out. We need to check with each other about how you're doing. And so, ah, I hope that you will as you work in this challenging area continue to consult and talk and take really good care of yourself because this is an exceptionally stressful content area to face alone which reminds me of what a different clients of mine said one time. I remember he said to me, "The mind is a terrible place to go alone," which is why we should keep talking directly to each other and to our clients about suicide prevention. Thank you for listening. 

00:19:35
THERAPY Talks 

00:19:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER Thank you that's, uhm, a very interesting topic but not, ah, necessarily a fun topic - 

00:19:50
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN No, uhm. 

00:19:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER - although your story was one-- the last one. 

00:19:50
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Thanks, yeah. It is good to have a positive story, uhm, and no it's not a fun topic but it's one that the whole point really is we need to be talking with our students, with other professionals, and with our clients directly about this because that's our best chance of really preventing and intervening with suicidal clients. 

00:20:15
DR. SHANNON DERMER And I like your point about the suicide contracts versus the collaborative suicide agreements - 

00:20:20
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:20:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER - or is that the term? 

00:20:20
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Safety plan. 

00:20:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER Safety plan. 

00:20:20
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:20:20
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:20:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER That's, uhm, you're right in some ways the suicide contract is in some ways to, to, ah, protect the mental health professional. The second one does that also but it's more about also protecting the, the client. 

00:20:35
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right, of course we document - 

00:20:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:20:35
John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. 

00:20:40
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN - that we've done a collaborative safety plan and so we do have some liability protection but we're doing it really for the purpose of protecting the client. And it's very clear that, that's the whole point. 

00:20:50
DR. SHANNON DERMER Yes. 

00:20:50
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I used, ah, I, I you know, I wrote an article way back in '95 on, ah, suicide assessments and the initial psychotherapy session. And, uhm, you know that was the standard and all the presentations my wife and I gave on over the years was no suicide contracts. 

00:21:05
DR. SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:21:05
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And then in some way there was this shift and I remember feeling a little bit just into it at first because there's really no evidence that no suicide contracts are bad because nobody wanted to do a double blind study. 

00:21:15
DR. SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:21:15
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right to see if they were or not, but I think giving-- getting feedback from, from patients and clients that really seems more about protecting the practitioner then about protecting the client that was important feedback to get. 

00:21:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER That's, ah, even though this is not about research here - 

00:21:35
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:21:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER - presentation is not research is one of the things that I like about qualitative research and then I think that practitioners can easily do like you going back and talking to your, uhm, client about what was it that made a difference. That's you know, you're doing a little bit of research there you know, uhm, but it also makes a difference clinically. 

00:21:50
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah, and I was really surprised right. I mean, I had-- I, I was surprised and kinda touched that really for her both of the things that helped her not kill herself one was this fresh student nurse. And she even told me very clearly she was, "You tell people be fresh." You know, approach it like it's the first time. 

00:22:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:22:15
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And that this is the most important client with whom you're working. And then the fact that you know, I, I really thought the neodissiociative-- dissociation technique is you know, from my old hypnosis roots have, have for sure, that was it. And maybe it helped but really it was her feeling connection to me. 

00:22:30
DR. SHANNON DERMER Well, part of you wants to-- I was just gonna say, part of you wants to believe that, that technique worked and part of... 

00:22:35
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes, that's true. A big part of me wants to. 

00:22:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER And I'm sure it does work in some ways but I think what you said is important and that it's easy for us as professionals to start protecting ourselves especially when we work with dangerous or things that really cannot affect us personally like a client, uhm, you know, completing suicide or something like that, that we start to protect ourselves but that can be perceived by our clients as not caring. 

00:23:00
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Absolutely. 

00:23:00
DR. SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:23:05
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Absolutely, and even too wrapped up in our own anxiety about it really you know, I think this is what I would really work to get across the students if any students are watching is like it's okay, your clients will talk about suicide. It-- you know, the base rates of suicide very rare, one in 10,000. Right. So, it's okay to talk about that and we're better off when our clients tell us about their suicidal thoughts than they keep quiet. And so try not to get all wrapped up and anxiety about it because that's our anxiety and it interferes, it's more of a self-focus than focusing on the, on the client. 

00:23:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER That's a good point and I think that some people's anxiety comes in and if, ah, just like other topics for, ah, clinicians or parents or the-- can we talk about it somehow that they'll be more likely to do it. 

00:23:55
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:23:55
DR. SHANNON DERMER When you're actually saying it's probably the opposite. 

00:23:55
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN No evidence to suggest they're talking about directly. Now, I do think there are important ways to frame it and if I'm working with, ah, client I'll say, "You know, it's not unusual for someone who's just gone through a relationship break up to actually sometimes to have some thoughts of suicide. I'm wondering if you've had any." Which frames it as, ah, you know, my old supervisor used to say, "Making the deviant response normal." Well, I've just changed my belief, I don't think it's a deviant response anymore. I think people have those thoughts and so we might as well welcome that into the room. Let's hear about it and the person can say no. And I'm not suggesting a plan, right. You know, now if you did that then you might have some liability. 

00:24:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER Right, yeah, so really you're normalizing it. I'm normalizing it absolutely. 

00:24:45
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:24:45
DR. SHANNON DERMER And you're actually being-- I don't think a lot of people talk about this proactive about, uhm, you know, have you had any suicidal thoughts what-- but doing it in a way that it makes, "Oh, I would ask anyone who's in a situation the same thing." 

00:24:55
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right, right. Eg-- and sometimes with, uhm, teenagers they'll say you know about 50% of high school, uhm, students report thinking about suicide sometimes. Do you ever have those thoughts? It makes it easy for them to say yes, 50/50 you know. 

00:25:10
DR. SHANNON DERMER Yeah. Yeah, you know, I think normalizing with taboo topics is especially important and so but I haven't really heard anyone talking about it very much around this particular topic. So I think that's... 

00:25:20
John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. 

00:25:20
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, and another one my big point is that a lot of people don't even feel very comfortable talking about it. And I have to say again not my most fun and favorite topic to present on but so important. Let's keep the conversation going so that we can actually deal with the problem when it does arise. 

00:25:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER You know, some people say when someone had said, "Yes, I thought about suicide or I, I have tried you know, you to, uhm, I have tried to commit suicide," or things like that, that they will ask about it every single session then after that. Do you believe in that approach or different approach? 

00:26:00
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know again, it, it, ah, it all kinda goes back to collaborative relationship, okay. And so I would say it's case by case that may be appropriate to check each week after that but it may be that you'll get to a place in your collaborative relationship where of course your client knows and will tell you proactively as a part of the kind of contract or agreement that's implicit in a collaborative deeper more intimate relationship that they, that they would tell you and that you don't have to be that checker. Let me check, got that. 

00:26:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER Right, cuz again that probably feels more like the suicide contract you know. 

00:26:40
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Exactly. 

00:26:40
DR. SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:26:40
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Cuz I'm-- I need to check with you to make sure that you wouldn't do this and like I need to check it off my list. And so even if, if practitioners, therapists do this every week I-- they're gonna do it different, different ways, different times to blend it into the ca-- into the counseling process in a way that it feels natural. 

00:27:00
DR. SHANNON DERMER Okay. So really that collaborative safety plan is really about, ah, again about creating a relationship. 

00:27:05
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. 

00:27:05
DR. SHANNON DERMER Uhm, enhancing a relationship instead of just checking something off a list. 

00:27:10
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, David Jobes has written, ah, ah, an approach called Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicide, the CAMS approach. 

00:27:20
DR. SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:27:20
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And, ah, and it-- I, I really think it's great approach and it emphasizes that relationship instead of I am the authority and I need to check with you instead it's well let's just work together. How do we bring some, some light into the darkness? 

00:27:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER It's very-- two very different things come in is an authority figure versus someone who's gonna may be help you to choose something different. 

00:27:45
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Absolutely that's true, yeah.

DR. SHANNON DERMER So, what would you like to leave the viewers with like, uhm, one co-- if you had to boil everything down to one core piece of advice. 

00:28:00
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Don't be afraid of talking about suicide. We need to as therapist normalize the conversation. It's terrible, it's tragic, it's painful. Ah, but were better off talking about it as a reality than we are letting it take control of us by scaring us. And so, it's just really about, let's, let's talk about even though it's uncomfortable. It can be better off. 

00:28:35
DR. SHANNON DERMER Good. So by not being afraid you and your client together are taking control of suicide ideation you know, or suicide attempts instead of letting those take control of us in our therapeutic process. 

00:28:45
DR. JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It's a great, it's, it's, it's a good way of putting it and in some ways were being a model for our clients by talking about it directly and not being afraid of it with being a model and that its-- so you have a suicidal thought come up. Don't be afraid of it. Notice it, it's a little bit of a mindfulness approach.
