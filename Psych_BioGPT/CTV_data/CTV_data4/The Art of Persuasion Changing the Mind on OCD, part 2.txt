00:00:55
 And I've kind of said this to you, what happens to habituation. Very interesting around frequency, intensity, duration, because when we start to orient like this, it doesn't take much frequency for them to have an Ah! Ha! Oh! That's what happens right so that you can't sustain a 50 or above in intensity if you're simultaneously saying I'm not anxious enough. Please make more anxious. And let me be clear about that, which is I'm asking the disorder to create the uncertainty to increase the uncertainty. I'm asking the disorder to make me more anxious. Typical way we do it is to try to get more anxious, focus on those thoughts, try to get yourself worked up more and more, not how I do it. I am going to put myself in the provoking circumstance. I'm going to get some of it going and that I'm going to request this external challenger to do it and that's the true paradox of it all. This is how you know you're practicing. Your client knows he's practicing when he stands in front of this event and he goes, this sounds like a really bad idea, right. And that's certainly what this guy was saying. We had to apply a lipstick to him four times to get that done here just to let you know, it's a kind of torture that we all went through, this is a fake picture actually, I didn't do this with somebody. This is Hebb's Law, neurons that fire together wired together. Going in and provoking the distressing situation, pairing up by changing my voice so to speak with that and do it over and over until it comes naturally. With tenure four, I'm going to talk about compulsions a little bit, but I want to stop in if couple or three or four people go to the microphone and either say something or ask a question then I will get some feedback from you and answer some questions and then I'll talk about the interesting work that you can do is compulsion. So, if it's one person, we'll be taking a break, but yes, go ahead. Can you move that up? Yes, there you go. Turn it on or make the chief volunteer turn it on and you can turn yours on while you are waiting and the sound person's left. So, not how it's supposed to go. 

00:03:50
 I don't think it's on. Oh! Now it's on. So, if you're working a pre-teen or a teen, how do you instruct the parents to be either involved or not involved or? 

00:04:00
 So, with a pre-teen or a teen, first off, I will tend to see them by themselves and if they are young enough by the end of the session, I'll have the parents come and I'll have the child teach the parent what the child has learned in the session. Basically the work is between me and my client. The parents are not in the picture. Now, we can give them an assignment, hey do you want to take notes? Do you like to write or should we make mom be the secretary so I kind of be derisive, is that the right word, having to write things down, let's give it to her, ha, ha, ha. So, now we have the parent being able to log things in for us to make it easier for the kid, but I don't want to put the parents in any kind of responsibility of watching over and encouraging them do their homework, that's going to be between the kid and me. And the rest of the stuff is no different. But we have to understand that 65% of children who have anxiety disorders have at least one parent with an anxiety disorder. So, if we don't train the parents really well, we don't want them doing much of anything in terms of guidance because they're going to come in and mess things up. We know that when we have kids do particular tasks that have uncertainty involved and they take -- they make decisions, they will go toward a particular little more risky situation. If we pull the same kid out and put them in with those parents and have them take the same questionnaire, they do a more conservative answer, they are more careful. So, parents can actually make things more difficult than better, my simple answer to all of that. You've left the microphone, so I guess it's okay. 

00:05:55
 Hi, great. You showed earlier bar graphs about the reduction in symptoms and the scoring. How do you count for then? Over time it didn't continue to go down, is that a matter of not continued clinical work or? 

00:06:15
 Yes, the problem with two-day treatment, I mean, I use to do this with -- I worked in a crime pain unit and we worked with crime pain patients for five weeks and within five weeks we had almost everybody off pain medications and doing great. The problem was they flew in from all around the country and we never saw their families and then they went home and they regress back to the mean, if the they didn't say the buck stops here. The problem with an intensive two-day treatment is there's no follow-up and none of the people in the study were working with anybody who did the protocol with them. So, the good news was they -- some of them continued to get better anyway. What I'm wanting you to understand in this room is if we're using this protocol with exposure and response prevention, then you're seeing them weekly and you're still doing exposure and response prevention. We're just plugging in a model that helps them feel more motivated and take ownership. Go ahead. 

00:07:15
 That helps to clarify. 

00:07:20
 So, I'm not trying to replace anything. This is just trying to add something to make it not so torturous. Yes, thanks Pam. 

00:07:25
 I was wondering this may just be a matter of how diagnosis -- like when somebody has thinking of pre-clinical and I've worked with it, was avoiding going to the bathroom. So, does that get -- would you put that... 

00:07:40
 Avoiding going to the bathroom, why? 

00:07:40
 I saw them very briefly before they end up working with me. 

00:07:45
 But you've seen the OCD and avoiding going bathroom. 

00:07:45
  That's what I was wondering about, what it -- I guess there are ways that it could fit in OCDs and in ways that it wouldn't. I guess in terms if it did fit in OCD, it's almost been negative. 

00:07:55
  We don't know what the -- we're missing information, not going into the bathroom for what reason? 

00:08:05
 Right. I guess just in terms of responding to deal with things that are negative compulsions almost things I won't do rather than things I have to do. 

00:08:10
  Everybody is doing the negative. The number one thing that people do is avoid. So, it's -- that's what we want to do, have them view the problem in such a way as to step forward, because everyone that sees you has been viewing in such a way to step back. Want to experience physical and emotional arousal, allow it to come forward without fighting it. And somebody who won't go in the bathroom because they might start pulling their hair out or whatever is avoiding in order to stay comfortable and not put them in a situation that they feel uncertain about. And so, we want to -- but again in this model, we're not working on a hierarchy, I don't really work on a hierarchy. The instruction is putting yourself in the circumstance and do anything that would provoke to any degree of uncertainty is how I do it with them. They know what their goal is, I want my life back and move on. I don't have to keep working on that with them. Go ahead. Do you have a follow-up? 

00:09:15
 No, thank you. 

00:09:15
 No? That's good. Yes sir. 

00:09:20
 When you have a kind of a situation where the patient has or the client has the kinds of thinking that is very destructive that they are very afraid of, like they are afraid they're going to stab their wife, they're afraid they're going to do something really horrible. Now, obviously you can't behaviorally have them engaged with that kind of the thing. 

00:09:40
 Did have him put a knife to someone's throat and say, I look forward to see in the blood flow down on your chest, but go ahead. 

00:09:45
  Okay, what if -- you can get a certain amount of resistance with -- that's sort of -- that's somehow morally wrong. 

00:09:55
 To do what? 

00:09:55
 To engage in that kind of thinking, to engage in that kind of thing. So, it's almost like they... 

00:10:00
 Well, they do think that morally wrong? 

00:10:00
 They do think that. It's like a conviction that's very, very strong to get around. 

00:10:05
 Okay. And you're asking what do you do? 

00:10:10
 What do you do, yes? 

00:10:10
 Well, if I'm going to sit on contempt, I'm screwed. So, my job is to say as nothing to do with that. It has to do with this. You have OCD, our issue is uncertainty not your topic. I can't fix your topic. You get a parent, you'll go well, you know I love my infant, my toddler. I would never harm my toddler, but what it for one split second, I went crazy and popped her little neck and killed her, how do you know I'm not going to do that? Well, I don't know if you're homicidal maniac or not, I've no idea. I can tell you -- the only reassurance I can give you is that you have OCD. I know OCD well, this is OCD, people with OCD have thoughts that they don't act on, do I also think you're a homicidal maniac? I don't. Do you feel at risk? Are you afraid you're going to snap your daughter's neck because we can help you. We can hospitalize you. We can put your child in foster care. We can arrange someone to supervise. We'll handle contempt if you want us to. So, I'll never have to -- I don't have address that. It'd be surprising when you challenge people like that. All of a sudden they clean up, okay, so OCD, all right, all right. But you're in a conundrum with all anxiety disorders -- this happens all the time in supervision. They'll say, well, I tried this, this, this and this and they didn't really go for that. Can I have some more ideas? No, now get me more ideas. They've got to go toward it. So, you're going to be in trouble if you try to soothe everybody's feathers around contempt. So, thank you for sitting down, because I'm not sure I could say anything else about that and you're polite and make it look like I answered your question. So, Kathleen? 

00:12:05
KATHLEEN Hello. 

00:12:05
 Hi. 

00:12:05
KATHLEEN You know how trauma can be simple or complex and there's two different approaches for treating those. What about OCD because I've got a client with rumination which involves regurgitation of food, also IBS and he was physically traumatized in the stomach area so he's got some RSD. 

00:12:30
 Are you really going to toss me a complex case and ask me to answer in front of 600 people. 

00:12:35
KATHLEEN I am. 

00:12:35
 You are. 

00:12:35
KATHLEEN I mean to say, I don't know where to start. Do I start with AOC? 

00:12:40
 So, which of all that OCD? 

00:12:40
KATHLEEN  Oh! Well, that's on top on all of it. He obsesses about everything. 

00:12:50
 Okay, so, well back up and to answer your question. So, I've got a complex case and even if its complex anxiety disorder or complex OCD and they have all these, you've got a few choices. What's hot for them? What do they want to change most? You can go with that. What is in the way of getting out there and getting the job or whatever, you can start with that. What's giving him the most trouble, you could start with that. The other one to start with is what am I best at doing. So, if you do trauma work, start with the trauma work because it'll give you placebo. Always lead I would say, I mean, there's exceptions, always lead with your strengths. This stuff that I'm talking about is going to be weak for you because you've got to pretend that you what you are talking about. So, if you can with something else, go ahead. Now, sometimes, ones in the way of another and of course you've got to have to start working on that when they can't get out of their because of the acrophobia but they also have this other stuff, how am I doing in this answer. 

00:13:50
KATHLEEN This is great. 

00:13:50
 Do you want to do a follow-up question about that or -- you've got lots of choices about where to go. The big one would be do I see an angle that I think I can get some leverage from and get some results from and I'll be doing that way. 

00:14:05
KATHLEEN If he only had rumination. If that were his obsession? 

00:14:10
 Yes, now rumination we tend to talk about depression as ruminating and obsessions with an anxiety disorder. 

00:14:20
KATHLEEN But this is regurgitation. 

00:14:20
 You mean to say throwing up? 

00:14:25
KATHLEEN He throws up, he spits up. 

00:14:25
 And he is afraid of throwing up? 

00:14:30
KATHLEEN Well, he does it quite a bit, I don't think he's afraid. 

00:14:30
  So, that's not an obsession, that's not an obsessive compulsive disorder, being afraid of throwing up and throwing up is... 

00:14:35
KATHLEEN He is afraid of the pain that comes with it. 

00:14:40
 Again he can obsess about that, I mean schizophrenics obsess, lots of disorders obsess. We got to have the combination of obsessing in the definition that we have here. So, your people who are afraid of throwing up obsess about it, but that's a specific phobia and not OCD and we'd probably use that paradigm to treat that problem. 

00:15:05
KATHLEEN Okay, thank you. 

00:15:05
 Thought more at supper. Yes, mam. 

00:15:10
 What age do you feel is appropriate to start working children that display anxiety disorders? 

00:15:15
 Are you a child therapist? 

00:15:20
 Family dynamics, sometimes there is children involved. 

00:15:25
 You start as young as -- you can work with in your training. As young as you can take, now some people would say, and for me, I'm not a child psychologist, I'm an anxiety specialist, I worked with them down to seven years old, but I don't treat anything other than anxiety disorder and they have to have another therapist to treat behavior problems and all that kind of stuff. I worked as a five-year-old too, but I've worked with the family. So, you can do it, I've worked as young as five, but we've got trichotillomania at 18 months. 18, at a year and a half, pulling hair out, so something's going to have to be done other than getting the 18 months to do something. So, we have to have parents education and interventions as opposed to working only with the child. 

00:16:15
 Well, I have a mother with a sever anxiety disorder who has a five year old and she says that she sees very similar traits developing in the five year old. So, do you think at five years old, you can start addressing that? 

00:16:30
 Oh! Sure, because five year olds have games, they play games all the time. I had a mother call me up about her five year old son who was brushing his -- doing repetitive brushing of his legs and I talked on the phone with the mother 15 minutes, that's it, and we got rid of that piece. All we did was teach him to do it different rhythm and then another rhythm and did a token economy, scored points, won prizes and that was gone about I'm having to make this up a six months later, he developed a new one, not so much symptom substitution, but we were just messing with a compulsion like we're about to do in a few minutes. And the new one was he has to move his arms in a stiff position and so forth. So, I brought the family in, the dad didn't want to be there, my son's not sick, there's nothing wrong, you don't need to be here so I'm getting rapport with them and joking around. And I do this thing around I bet you can't do this, I've got all three of them there and I take my arms and I have a little thing where I can actually create a hole that big and put my head through it and dad now thinks he is really sorry he came. I talked to the five year old about remembering this and then I've had some videos so I remember pretty well at this stage, and then I just said, well I wonder if you can do -- could you do this instead and I went through a series of little changes and then I set up a competition between the five year old and his mother. And the competition was every time he could -- he found himself doing that, if he could change and do it a different way, he would say "Mom I did it." And he would get five points or he would get ten points. If mom said, "Harry, you're doing it, you need to practice what Dr. Wilson talk about." And he changed it, he only got five points. Mom, your job is to try to catch Harry before he makes that change. So, you don't have to give him the five -- only five points. Harry your job is try to make the change before mother, so I just played that and what I wanted you to understand is when you start doing games like that, even your adults come back in and report -- I'm going to give you an example a little bit, report how they did on the game part of it as opposed to how they did on changing the compulsion. And that worked very nice. I saw them one time and then maybe you did terribly later and they didn't want to call me anymore, but that worked. But that little competition, mom was totally caught on to it and kid was I'll show her. 

00:19:30
 Okay, thank you. 

00:19:30
 Okay, I'll take one more thing around kids, I had a kid who was afraid vomiting and getting sick. When he sees anything, having to do with surgeries and all this kind of stuff, so we did that same kind of thing with the parents that at the dinner table dad or mom had to start describing people having surgeries with putting plastic parts, fake crazy kinds of things and the son's job was to keep flat effect and not show any expression. And if he did, then he got certain points and so forth. So, we just did a series of them with him. His sister is afraid of -- you know what a Camel Cricket is? Ugly, pre-historic, just disgusting in the basements of North Carolina homes. And so, she was afraid of camel crickets so we set it up for him if he would teach his sister to get over camel crickets, he would get $25, he negotiated with her that she would get sticks of gum if she would practice with him. So, just setting up things like that with kids works in an interesting way. So, enough of me chatting. 

00:20:45
 It was great. My voice is not good, because I'm sick, but I wanted to hear you talk about one of my patients if you would. She has a phobia for HIV or getting HIV, she's not sexually active, but she tests three or four times a week and all day long, she reads about on computer blogging other people who've gotten in or testing whatever? 

00:21:05
  She's afraid of that, but you know that is a phobia. And so, I'm not going to answer that question, but I'm going to give you -- we're going to talk about compulsions now and this is going to tell you how to do it with that. And if you want to come up afterwards, well then maybe I'll say a few things with you or maybe I won't. So, we're ready to talk about compulsions here? And what she just described again as you see how we do this, you'll see that how you can start messing with somebody like that. So, here's what we got around compulsions. Here's the obsessing beginning and they get to stress and anxious. See there's a division here, I have an urge to ritualize and then I ritualize and then what it says is ritualizing and resisting, they resist the ritual because it's takes so long and so much energy and so tedious. But when they resist this, they don't concentrate on it well enough. Don't focus on it well enough, don't feel like they did it right and they have to do it again, all right. Here's exposure and response prevention, which is a hospital model and it's very different to convince people to do this work when you only see them once every seven days. So, what I'm trying to work on here is, let's mess with it. Before we extinguish it or don't do the compulsion, let's see if we can mess around with the compulsion. The term I use is, throw the symptom across your bone, that means we're going to take what the pattern is, remember this is a strategic therapy, so we're looking for patterns, you want to mess it up. We're going to keep part of the pattern and change part of the pattern. Keep part of the pattern and change part of it that OCD kind of will go, okay I guess that's a reasonable enough facts similarly of what I need you to do that I'll let you do that. I'm going to give you an example so that hold on. The interesting thing is when you start to mess with it and you're only going to know this if you do this enough is that it's so much easier to change a ritual that's only seven days old that it is to change a ritual that's four years old. So, if you can make a modification that so to speak OCD goes along with that still provokes a little uncertainty, then all of a sudden, the job gets a little easier as you've messed with it and started to have some success. Everybody does exposure and response prevention in the end, there's no tricks that totally gets out of them. So, right out of MRI, right out of the Palo Alto group, Milton Erickson Group, this is looking for patterns. Here's a list of characteristics that we would think about regarding compulsions. They have a particular order often, certain objects, bar soap or liquid soap, where they're standing, what the thinking, what they're feeling, all of these, the number the repetitions, see I'm going to pull in the parking brake four times or I'm going to dip my tea bag ten times, before I ring it out and so forth, all of those we want to analyze and get a list of and find out what the pattern is because the more complex it is the better because there's places there's all kinds of things that we can change when we have a whole list. I had a woman that I was working with right trichotillomania. Tell you this on Tuesday, Wednesday, whenever it was, trichotillomania, so she pulls her eyebrows out. So, pulling one eyebrow out it takes not very long was about 12 steps. It goes like -- we put it up on the board and the pattern all right. So, I'm watching TV, I'm feeling bored, I feel a little tingling in my eyebrow, my hand slowly moves up to my eyebrow, begin to feel around, I feel some hairs that are starting to grow, I feel excited about that, I feel some stubble, I find one that I think needs to come out, I grab it, pull on and make a tong, then I jerk it out and then I eat the follicle, that rude and then roll it on my finger and throw it on the floor. That's the pattern. So, what I would want to do with her which of course I did was I just wrote and put it up on the whiteboard and then we just went each step, what would you do differently here. Just so we can start getting some ideas and like we've got to feel excited, I said what could you do differently about when you would typically feel excited, when you found that hair, she said, well why would I want to change that, I'm excited, my hair is starting to grow. Well, I said, just look what happens next, all right, about feeling excited then she goes to the next step, what if she felt neutral, had no feelings about it and we're disrupting her right. So, if you've got somebody who's going to slowly -- somebody's pulling on the eyebrow, we can have them have a little Koosh ball and then can sit watch TV and pull on the Koosh ball and use up that energy if you're lifting your hand up to your eyebrow, you've got to bend your elbow, you've got to put your first finger and your thumb together or what's the opposite of that. It's to lock your elbow and splay your fingers. So, when you start to lift up here, you can -- when you can catch it, you want to lock your elbow, splay your fingers and hold that position for three minutes, then you can relax again. So, those are the kind of changes that we're talking about messing with to get some kind of control. This whole locking the elbow and splaying the fingers for three minutes tightly, if you see my hand is tightly kind of dissipating some of that tension. After three minutes, you are very much aware that you almost pulled that hair. So, for her, we worked for four months. She did beautifully grew her eyebrows out. At Christmas time, she's Duke and she's flying back to Houston to see her parents and on the plane in five minutes, ripped an eyebrow out, totally ripped it out and then dropped out of treatment. I never saw her again. So, it is painful. It is painful to think that we got that far and I'm not sure what I would do differently with her and still because of that impulsivity and somehow wasn't kicked it, she was so disappointed. She didn't come back. So, okay, there are failures around. Here is how I would think about it if I were you regarding working with rituals. Now, I'm going to give you some examples. Some of them are from the old days. The old days are I will create the change and give that suggesting to them. Today, I do it this way. We collaborate, we brainstorm and with kids, I will typically do every other one. You come up with an idea, what the ideas are, what would we mess with? How would we change things? And with the kid it would be like you come with an idea, I'll come up with an idea, we'll just do every other one. And most of the ones that I come up with kids is they're ridiculous. They would never do it. It's just absurd stuff, because after we get that list of 12 up there so I'll go well which ones are you just not willing to do? There's a manipulation of him. Don't tell him I did this. Which one you're not willing to do and he will name off mine and take the eraser and erase all those, well then we've got four or five left. So, all of a sudden we've done this manipulation where is gone I'm not doing those, those are stupid. Oh! Okay, which one of these four would you do? All right, so that's what we're looking for, brainstorm a bunch of these if we can and then decide. So, we're saying, this is the one we want to do and I'm messing with the parent. So, we're trying to find any way to just feel somewhat uncertain and therefore uncomfortable. Find out what the pattern is, what the ritual tends to be, figure out ways to interrupt it and generate some kind of uncertainty and then from that decide what homework you're going to and part of it I would say now is make sure you give yourself commands. Don't cover up the mirror. Don't walk in there, whatever it might be, it should be part of it. I'm going to tell you a few stories if that's okay even if it's not, I'll tell you few stories. So, the first one, these are to remind me what they are. So, we had the client who just came from a supervision. Now, my eyebrows are itching. How does that happen, what's that about? Client counselor comes in for supervision around this woman who is a washer and cleaner and she just not able to make the shift and so I'm talking to her a little bit and we find out that she actually is in a conflictual relationship with her husband, so let's take advantage of that. He rubs his hands together, okay good. So, here's what we asked her to do, to go out and buy an expensive bottle of hand lotion. Bring it home, anytime, when are people allowed to wash their hands? When you are about to prepare food, when you're about to eat, after you've used the bathroom and then if your hands are visibly dirty. Those are the four times that would be typical of being allowed to wash your hands. In the other time of washing, that's a compulsive behavior we would say often. So, anytime she's washing at the inappropriate time, we would ask her to do this, to vigorously wash, she's good, make sure she's telling, this is for you George. So, we're going to ask her to be mad, mad, it's like, I'll just take advantage or help you wash cleaner. So, we're shifting the emotion from anxiety, I hope it gets cleaned it up. To be in mad, that disrupts it absolutely. And then when she feels like she's washed enough, not asking her to stop at any particular time, the she rinses her off, dry her hands off, and then she's got -- did I mention expensive hand lotion, okay they're little bottles, this is for me. I have a self soothing sense and then we rub like that. So, now we shifted an emotion again. Also what's the likelihood after applying, did I mention expensive, hand lotion that she's going to stick her hands back into the sink and wash again. As Milton Erickson would say, start by adding something to the routine before you start taking things away. People are much more willing to make it a little more complex than they are to start subtracting pieces of it. Here's a stupid one, the idea -- the task of the game is like ridiculous. So, I've got a guy who is afraid of HIV and so his issue is I'm going to brush up against someone who is HIV positive and I'm going to get AIDS , and so one of the things he is doing in all day of work is checking his cuticles because he is gonna meet a boss or meet somebody in the hall, touch them or whatever. If I have any crack in my cuticles so you know I should get it, it's preoccupied. So, what I asked him to do if you would just go to the bank and get 40 crisp new one dollar bills, fold them in half, put them in his left pocket. You need time, again stupid, right. You need time during the day that he checks his cuticles, he used to take a dollar bill out of his left pocket and put it in his right pocket. There's nothing, right and we are in an Email relationship and he wrote me that night -- the first night that he did it and said -- I'm exaggerated how his voice was because he was on Email, but you only had seven dollars in my right pocket tonight. So, he didn't say only checked seven times, he reported about the game itself. Again, you know checking this was one of many compulsions that he has, but you know it's the beginning of that shift. So? 

00:33:10
[sil.] 

00:33:10
 No, he -- if he checks he has to take a dollar bill. The goal is to keep 40 dollars in my left pocket, that's the game. The more dollars are going in my right pocket the more OCD is winning, so we knew that and he knew all -- he knows everything else that we've talked about. I don't -- you know not starting with this, you know I don't start with this I start with the principles. That's the mistake, we start with technique. Don't start with technique, start with principle. So, here we are. And so I had a college student that comes in. It's October. He's dropped out of school, UNC, University of North Carolina because of his OCD. He's just got all riddled with different subtypes. He's a washer and cleaner, he takes -- you know they take hour and a half showers. The water is freezing cold, but he is in college, the water never gets cold, but you know at home, it would. He is on order, so he's got to have the left side of his body equal to the right side of his body in weight lifting his -- you know all the compulsive weight lighting and checking in the mirror and does these things pills and how he counts them and moves them in his hand and in his fingers and you know. So I am -- again I have this on video, and so it's about session five and I'm talking to him and he's with his mother because the reason the parent is there or someone is in the room because when you get people who are really disturbed with OCD, they can't concentrate, they can't track things. So, to have a cohort there to support is to help. So, mom is there with him and we're trying to figure what to do next. What's he want to practice next? And he was telling about how he's been already changing. He was saying, you know anything that I imagine how to do it normally I'm doing pretty well now because I'm down the ten minutes showers, I know what that's like. I'm not sure, I'm not sure I would ever get over my nighttime ritual. Nighttime ritual, I know nothing about the nighttime ritual of session five, so the nighttime ritual -- and this will happen to you all the time. You do the initial interview and get the whole list, they'll come in the next week and they'll say I forgot five other things that I do and you have to take your pad out and get those. Nighttime ritual starts at 11 O'clock at night and goes till five in the morning, so no one really drops out of school, right. And his issues is like the woman with the box in the middle of the highway like the guy reading the newspapers in the ticker tape, what if I missed. And so, for him is what have I completed today and what do I need to carry over as a task to tomorrow. I'm afraid I'm gonna forget something, alright. So, he has seven phases of his night and I don't want any -- I don't want to know anything about it, alright? It's okay. And they'll come in, you have people like that. These have these mathematical equations and just don't even go there because they are all content anyway, right. And so, we've got this seven phases and he has a day runner, which is a day timer or has a schedule book which -- and day runner is where each day of the week is of two pages, full two pages. He said by five O'clock in the morning both pages are pitch black from the markings that he's had to do all night long as a part -- you're just taking that. It would be pitch black from all that -- so compulsive. So, I'm going -- we've got like five minutes left in session. I'm going, okay well. What are we going to do to mess with it? Let's add something. So, I said, well, so where is your day runner now. And he said, well it's in my -- it's in the trunk of the car. I said, well, what would you do to this? Would you be willing to give the day runner to your mom and have here hold onto it? And if you need it, just ask her for it and she will give it to you and mom if he asks for it, you give it to him. Mom is going to give it to him. He's a six foot four, muscle bound college student who gets infuriated when he's standing at his chair after dinner doing a mental ritual and mother comes in from the kitchen and says, son are you doing what Dr. Wilson is talking about. Because now she has interrupted him and he blows up at here because he's got to start all over again. So, mom is going to give it back to him. You know I asked him if he would do that and he said fine. He left, came back there, he lived like two hours away, came back in you know because he dropped out of school so he's back at home now, came back in two weeks later, never touched it again. And I would not have bet you one dollar that he would have done that. All I was doing was just changing something, but I tell you that story for a couple of reasons. One is the severity of the disturbance is not correlated with prognosis. You can see people who are really disturbed and if they can catch on, on the principles they are up like phoenix and he really was around that. That was near the -- you know two years later he reenrolls in school. He went to CAL College instead of UNC because it was at NC State University. That's a dig on them, so two years later he refers his roommate to me who has OCD, so you'll figure right. So, he did greater and that was that one. So, I've got a repeater. So, it's making sensitive because you are about to do it with me out loud, so we'll see how well you understand that. Here is a woman who has to -- she's got 12 things right before bed that she has to do ritualistically, but she's a repeater, so I've said before or husband will not get his job promotion tomorrow, sister will lose her bible game, parents are going to die tomorrow as they go to Florida, whatever it might have been that night, and so she got these -- you know women are at night and so, that was a joke just to tease the woman and they laughed hardly inside themselves just now even though they didn't do anything out loud, so she had this you know put those Vaseline on her lips and take this vitamin and everything has to be in that particular order. So, we work for a good while for her finally to say which is gonna -- this is what has to happen, I know that if I don't do this ritual those remote things aren't going to happen, but if I don't do these rituals I'm going to be so anxious, I'm not going to sleep, I'm going to -- or you know that -- and so you could get to that, that's a good spot to get to because these are anxiety disorders and if they go and if I don't do the ritual and be too anxious much good place, so -- but I'm not going to sleep and I got -- I'm a teacher, I've got to be older, work in the next -- you know tomorrow and so forth, so how would we handle the issue of I don't want to practice because I need to sleep in order to perform well as a teacher tomorrow? I can't stay awake because I got school tomorrow. I can't be dysfunctional as a teacher, yes. 

00:40:25
[sil.] 

00:40:25
 You would change the subject on her. 

00:40:30
[sil.] 

00:40:30
 No, no. I buy into it, but the consequence of dumping out of focus well at school is that's -- I can't do that. There's a simple answer to this. See if you can think of what it would be. When is the first time she should practice? On a Friday night, right. So, we start on a Friday night she runs a couple of video tapes, this is years ago when we didn't you know have DVDs and she had a novel to read and some magazines. She had nothing to do tomorrow, didn't have to get up and she said which is what you need to say is I don't care if I stay up all night, and now we got to go to I don't care. I don't care if I stay up all night. I want to get better badly enough that I won't stay up all night, that's fine. And so, once we have that set where she didn't worry about that step then what we had her do is write each of the items down on a piece of paper, cut them up, put them in a jar and draw them out randomly and do them, perform them. So, we're throwing the symptom across to her bone, she does every single one, she does them in an order, but it's a random order. Now interestingly, when she came in the next week she said I slept better that night than I typically do. Did it again on Saturday night, great. Comes Sunday night, she's got school the next day, can't do it. Took another four months for her to make the shift to do it on a school night even though she was doing greater and that's why I'm saying this you know the severity of the disorder you can have somebody light like that and still not get them to make that change. I'll do one more before you do it. I had somebody who I'd call chart boy. This is exactly OCD, but it's close enough and so his issue was death, the thought of death. And so, what would -- how it would go is he would be up in his bedroom, working on the computer or something, it only happen when mom is home and suddenly something would pop up in his head around death that totally freak him out and he'd jump up and run downstairs and throw his arms around his mother and cry hysterically for two or three minutes and she soothes him, he's a little bit down and then he'd be okay and then he would go and that's his ritual. So, now I see him for the first time and there is this sweet little, gentle, delicate, 11 year old boy that is so fragile, any illusions to the topic of death and the tears well up in his eyes and I'm going, I'm not going to do exposure in response prevention to this little boy. I just -- it just doesn't seem right, so in that frustration kind of cornered, I said, so would you be willing to do this? This week? If this before you jump up and run down to your mom, would you take your t-shirt off, turn it inside out and put it back on and then go to your mom? And we set up a reward system if he would do that, points and blah, blah, blah. And so, he did that and then the next week we got more and more elaborate and I have -- typically I will show the chart if we have more time, and they called him chart boy because he just had this elaborate chart of all about seven, eight different things that he would do that would score a point, so he'd go to his playroom and bring a toy down to his mother, go into the kitchen and bring her a diet soda as he's coming in to cry with her and hold her. He'd get one point if he would mess with it in this way. He would get two points if he could stand ten feet away from his mother and cry and tell her what you know to get soothed. He would get three points if he could wait 30 minutes before he did it and of course she waits 30 minutes and that's not there anymore. He loved that. He got you know a CD game and all these kind of things and it worked very nicely and as soon as he got a lot of points, he got his other bigger prize and did fine, didn't want to leave treatment. Wanted to keep seeing, we see each other once a month and for a while and then finally it tapered off and now the other thing was this is one of the only examples of symptom substitution I've ever had. Once we settled things at home, it popped up at school. Guess which class this 11 year started having trouble then? Biology, right. The earth science, biology whatever where the lifecycle and so he was like totally freaking out, having to leave, call his mother on the phone and all those kinds of stuff. So, we again devised this thing and I asked him to describe the room and he said, these posters on the walls, and so I said while you're listening to the teacher what -- how about trying this. See if you can create a title for each of those posters and then put them in alphabetical order in your mind. Just him a refocusing task and that ended up you know on the long runs, did pretty well with him. He finally left treatment, came back in at 14, started to be afraid of -- now I have this on tape and you'll probably be surprised that I'm relatively animated with my clients when I work with them, so and now he is afraid somebody is in the house and before he goes to bed he's got to go to each closet with a baseball bat to catch them and then he's gotta check the front door, locking it up and you know over and over again to make sure it's really secure. So, we're in the session brainstorming how to mess with locking the door and what you hear and see is I'm sitting back in my chair I'm talking in that relative monotone, he and I are throwing out ideas and I'm writing them on the board and the reason I'm sitting back is he is right. He knows just what to do and I say, well you know you could come down the stairs two at a time and he said, well maybe I could skip up to the door and -- or maybe I cloud spin around twice before I check the lock and then you know so that was -- that's what you will see when you got somebody trained you know to work quite so hard and all that got taken care off. What happened next, something really interesting to him and I can't remember and when I remember I'll come and tell -- oh! Well I know yeah the other piece of this is when he was working with me I've seen him in college now, he comes back and he really started screwing up in different ways, but not OCD anymore. He came -- in one session, we are in the waiting room, he stands up to walk in the office with me and as he's walking in he says, you know I have something else that has started happening. I'm starting to keep rhythm on my fingers, he's become a pill roller right. And he says, I'm keeping a rhythm on my fingers now, and so what do you think you could do differently. He said, well you know maybe I could do a different rhythm each time. And so, by the time we get to the door of my office, he's already fixed that problem and that's what we're looking for, being a good student of the work, so that he knows what to do. Now, the next -- here I get referred to his sister, his older sister who counts when she gets bored, so in here she'd probably know how many chandeliers their work is -- how slow the talk is going. So, -- and so -- and so, she and I are doing in one session this idea of how would you mess with the counting and we came up with all these ideas and I said which one do you want to try and she said, well I think I want to say every other number in Spanish and I said, why did you pick that one? And she said because that's the hardest one and that's how you know you have a good student to work that she says that would be the hardest and then she just you know went on her way. Let's see if you can do it. I'll give you few examples, and what we are going to do is -- and you're going to have to yell out and not whisper or we'll never get this done, but I'll give you few cases and let's see if we can just brainstorm some ideas about how we would mess with it. Don't worry about you know any details of it. Keep in mind, let's back up to what we are doing. If you got somebody with a compulsion, we've got the framework of how to do the treatment. Now, we're going to go manifest the framework in these moments with some messages like you know I want to be uncomfortable, I want to be uncertain, that's what I'm doing. Now we're gonna mess with the design. Let's brainstorm different things we could do and then let's pick them because whatever you're going to pick is going to make you somewhat uncomfortable and distressed. SO, the first case is a kid in the halfway house, 16 year old, washer and cleaner, every time it's his night to clean up, he's -- you know elaborate cleaning. Interesting, if he hear somebody walking down the hall, he's done. Don't have to do it. But if not, he's doing the elaborate cleaning and at the end of the night he's got to take the sponge and run water under it and squeeze it ten times or he counts to ten and then set it down. So, at this particular session we're just working on that task. What would he do differently instead of squeeze ten times under the falls and set it down? Can I have some ideas about what you might you do? And if you just say it loudly… 

00:49:40
[sil.] 

00:49:40
 I have him switch hands each times, okay. Yes ma'am. 

00:49:45
[sil.] 

00:49:45
 Put the hand up instead of down or down instead of up, which ever was -- okay good. Say what? Add five more to it. 

00:49:55
[sil.] 

00:49:55
 Turn the water off and on. She's thinks that's a great idea. She's gonna write that down, good. What else? Three more things. Use something different than a sponge. Interesting, brainstorming. So, what would you use different than a sponge? He's been cleaning with a sponge, so now he's putting this up, so you'd say he'd have to put the sponge up and squeeze the teapot or a rag or something or start cleaning with a rag instead of the sponge would be the other thing. Just replace the sponge. Yes ma'am. 

00:50:35
[sil.] 

00:50:35
 Not do it in the kitchen faucet, go to -- have to go to the bathroom and do it instead, good. Yes sir. 

00:50:45
[sil.] 

00:50:45
 Go hot and cold the water or turn it progressively hotter or only do with hot water and then you have -- instead of counting each squeeze it could go hot, hot, and hotter, hottest and pull his hand down because he can't stand that anymore, good. So, here's what I -- okay, one more, yeah. 

00:51:00
[sil.] 

00:51:00
 No, that would never work. Start it up in the air with each one, so here's what I had him do. The first week I said, would you do this every squeeze change hands. One, two, three and ten, so again throwing the symptom cluster above, still squeezing, still rinsing, still counting just switching hands and he was fine doing that. Did it, came back the next week, said it was good. I said, okay. How about this week? Would you do this? Squeeze, toss, catch. It's good when I think of that idea. Now, when you think of the idea and I had it first okay. Squeeze, toss, catch, squeeze, toss, catch and you know he's 16 going in 11. He thought that was a good idea. Now, I make a classic mistake which is -- okay maybe not classic but it was a bad mistake, which is I -- the next time he comes in I don't ask him about it and don't give anybody homework without asking about it because you reinforce them you know like it not -- it's doesn't matter. So, I forgot to tell him -- ask him this time because we're working on a bunch of things. The next time I see him, forget to ask him. The third time I say, how is it going with the sponge. And he said, well, I just it squeeze it and set it down now, right. He knew what he was working on, this disrupted enough and he went to the position of squeezing it once and setting it down. So, that was it. So, here's a physician who is married to a physician who work together. The wife drags him into treatment. Are we stopping at five O'clock? Oh! We are so on time because this is really -- there's like two more slides after this and we are like done. Don't leave but this could -- but -- so -- and so, he is spraying himself with ammoniated Windex. He told me he was doing 36 double pulls. He actually told me later I was too embarrassed to tell you how many times I was pulling so -- and his wife is there and you know she is going to divorce him, so rather then therapy to help him get better, so that she doesn't leave him and she is saying, you know I'm just fed up with him. I work with him, I live with him. He's got this thing. He only has two chairs in the whole house. We never sit together. He's in the kitchen. He turns and watches the cans and I'm just fed up that I can't fix it. Just you know he's got to do something. And so, you know by half way through the session I'm like embarrassed to ask the question, but I go ahead and ask the question. I don't want to have egg on my face, but then I don't want to offend her, but I say, is there something going on with your throat. She says, well the internists are saying that the ammonia is beginning to wear away my larynx. So, he's a physician making his wife physically ill and still not making a change and I mean so that's the nature of the disorder as opposed to him. So, here we got this case. What are some ideas about working with this particular problem of spraying 36th? 

00:54:05
[sil.] 

00:54:05
 Make him to windows for after. At least he'll be good for something. Dilute the Windex with water. Okay, there is an idea. What else? 36 times open the windows, 36 times. 

00:54:30
[sil.] 

00:54:30
 Make it 18. We probably want to lift the numbers first before we go down, but change in the numbers is good. Squeeze to a rhythm, okay. 

00:54:40
[sil.] 

00:54:40
 Do make his wife do summer-salts in between each squeeze or do summer-salts himself between his squeeze. Okay, these are all great ideas, yes. 

00:54:55
[sil.] 

00:54:55
 Hey, you don't think that's a good idea. We'd brainstorm into whatever you said is fine. It's goes on the list. So, he's a treatment failure. Just to let you know I have plenty of those. He -- and so, the first we did was immediately switched it to vinegar based Windex. No problem totally it didn't bat an eye about doing that. Then we start watering it down, a third water, two-thirds water, and that's as far as we've gotten. Here's that example of people getting half way better, a third better and then plateauing off. He still believed in the contamination issue, alright. I even had him write a letter to the editor of Jama to say how all his colleagues should follow his sanitary practices and he did write it. So, it didn't get published, but he did send it, so and what started -- and I kicked him out of practice because -- in the therapy because he started coming less frequently and he is one of these good old boys and he wants to about football, he wants to talk about politics and I'm colluding with him to be able to say to his wife, don't fire me honey, I'm in therapy, right. So, I kicked him out twice. He came back in then he never came back in. But these are good ideas, we can use them for other people. I got one who is not up here. His name was -- I'll better call him Joe and Joe is -- he is a vending machine stocker not somebody going you know he stocks vending machines with soda and crackers and things, and so he is in the hospital doing the stocking and he sees a sign for AIDS and he goes, oh! My God. And this is how it happens you know they are reading -- they look at the newspaper and think oh! I was reading the paper and it said that a woman from Michigan kills all five of her children and kills herself and I'm a mother and then -- and then they develop OCD. So, same with him, he reads that and he goes oh! AIDS patients are touching these knobs, I'm touching these knobs, I could get AIDS like this. I see him four years after he leaves that job. No longer any stimulus about this, but every time he uses the bathroom he has to wash for 45 minutes. He -- anyway and then when he comes home he washes for 2.5 hours. He says, you know I'm married now. I don't have anything else to do. His wife will also rise. So, he -- when he washes at home he has a stool, he sits in front of the wash -- the sink and he washes when he gets bored he goes like a surgeon in a little anteroom watches TV for a while and comes back in, washes ad nauseam. So, what could we do to change the things about with him? Get rid of the stool. That was one thing I did in the first session. What was the next thing? And turn the TV off, right. So, those are the two things I did with him. He came in the next week. I turned off the TV, got rid of the stool and went from 2.5 hours down to an hour and half, last good thing I did, nothing else helped. The next week I ask him to teach me how he -- no, no the next thing -- the week I asked him to get a egg timer, and wash ad nauseam, wash as long as he want, but every three minutes pulls his hands out dry his hands off and then he can wash again you know I'm thinking well eventually he's going to go okay my hands are dry I'll walk off. He comes back in the next week, hasn't done that. Here's his quote, stop giving me homework doc, just fix me, right. I knew I was in trouble at that point right. So, and then I go oh! Well, teach me how you wash. And so, he's you know I washes each of the digits and then he washes his palm and then he washes the back of his hand. I said, okay great. Would you do this? Wash every other digit, come back and catch those two you missed then do the back of your hand and then do your palm. And then I never saw him again. But these are good ideas. See it's like messing with it like that. We'll do -- let's do one more -- let's do the checking the hair curler in the store and the microwave and the iron and the front door to make sure they are not going to bring the house down so forth. How would we change this particular one? Change the order, okay good. 

00:59:15
[sil.] 

00:59:15
  From point system four. 

00:59:25
[sil.] 

00:59:25
 Okay, point system rewarding them for doing it in different order would be perfectly fine. What else? 

00:59:35
[sil.] 

00:59:35
 Add some more things to check, okay. Spend more time because that would make -- some people would love that, so but -- could -- that would certainly be fine. So, we've always have to give them a task to do for that time while they are doing it. Move them all, put them in one place, you know and they are checking or somebody had another idea? 

00:59:50
 Let them move the items. 

00:59:50
  Move the items. It could -- after you've unplugged some -- you could tie it in a bow and things like that. That's kind of a checking thing. So, you'll get clients who come in and say every time I unplug the hair curler I tie it in a bow, so we got to change that for them, but somebody else you know you could use that as an example. Anyway you get the idea, play in with this, kind of come up with these things, get them to do it. You know I know a lot of the examples where me doing it for them, but I keep those because they're very interesting. I'm bringing up the slide that we had at the beginning just to remind you what I said. I'll take any questions in just a minutes if you want to ask them, but let's think about changing the point of view, creating and -- how ever you want to do, you don't want to do it like a game if you don't want to, but at least you know this is -- let's figure how to do the opposite of what -- I do think personifying the disorder and externalizing has a lot of therapeutic benefit because we can start talking about it in a different way. If you listen to your clients they have integrated the OCD and keep saying I do this then I do that and so on and so forth. If we can externalize it and get them to start going then the OCD gets me to you know -- anything like that. Now, we've got that going, so and that's just reminding you the kind of benefits that we've seem to be fine and I'm glad we have data now and my particular feel is very hard to present anything new in the field because everybody else has their little niche with their money coming in for that research and they don't want to make a change. So, you have to kind of push the door open and so that finally you have taken time and gotten some data to say this does work and it's pretty definitive that it does work then you know hopefully we will get it out there in the world. I will turn this into a self. I only write self-help books, so this will eventually be the next thing that I write just as an aside, Lynn Lyons, who is here and I have written a book for children who are anxious. And we are now finishing up a parenting book for kids who are anxious. You know we will end up within about six months to be giving away the children's' book for free on the Internet and it's already complete, finished it and it's written by through the voice of a 14 year old girl. And so, she's a 14 year girl who has gone through anxiety and kind of mastered it and she and her mom figured stuff out and she teaches the principals of how to get better or very careful to get off of contempt into principles and now we're doing it for the parents that will coincide with that book so they will have the kids books to use. We will turn it into an audio book for younger kids, I think it will be for nine and above soon. So, anyway that's around and you can --hopefully you will see it somewhere. Are there any -- let's stop formally and then…
