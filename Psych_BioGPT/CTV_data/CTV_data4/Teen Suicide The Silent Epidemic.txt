Keeping Kids Healthy 

00:01:05
WINNIE KING , MD Did you know that about 20% of high school students have considered attempting suicide in the past year? That’s what suicide experts say and that comes to about five teens in every classroom of 25 or 30 students. Now, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, suicide is the third leading killer of young people between the ages of 15 and 24. Everyday, 14 teens in this country take their own lives. What’s going on? And even more importantly, what can we do about it? Well, we’re going to find out. I want to introduce you just some very special people. Right next to me is the lovely Amanda Pellicier and she is 19 years old. She is a student and she has attempted to take her own life several times. And she is going to tell us today about her journey to recovery and we’re so glad that you are here. Thank you so much for being with us. 

00:01:50
AMANDA PELLICIER Uh…Huh… 

00:01:50
WINNIE KING And sitting right next to her, we have Dr. Alec Miller, and he is the… an Associate Professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and also the Director of the Adolescent Depression and Suicide Program at Montefiore Medical Center. Thank you for being here. Amanda, I… I do want to start with you. The… The burning question that everyone has is why in the world that you want to take your own life? 

00:02:10
AMANDA PELLICIER Survived Suicide Attempts Well, the way that I was feeling at those times so depressed, I suffered from depression and I was tried to explain to people, it's like having your mother die and feeling like that worse, double times worse and all the times like a black cloud follows you around and there's nothing you can do about it. And a lot of people, I guess would relate suicide to insanity, but for me it was… it was the insane… To my… What I was feeling, it was insane for me to just go on another minute and… 

00:02:45
WINNIE KING Feeling that way? 

00:02:45
AMANDA PELLICIER …so much pain, right. 

00:02:45
WINNIE KING Now, Alec do you hear this often. I mean, this is painful, just hearing her talk about this. Are these the kinds of things that you hear from teens? 

00:02:55
ALEC L. MILLER , PsyD Albert Einstein College of Medicine Absolutely, and I think it's important we need to think about that suicide is a silent epidemic in this country. I don’t think the viewers may know this but, well there are 18,000 homicides each year in our country. There are 30,000 suicides. And in the average high school classroom as you mentioned, there are about 20% of them who have thoughts about suicide in the past year, about 15 of them have a plan, 15%, about 8 to 10% of them make an attempt and only 2 to 3% get medical attention. So, there are… 

00:03:20
WINNIE KING Wow! 

00:03:25
ALEC L. MILLER …thousands of them out there… 

00:03:25
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:03:25
ALEC L. MILLER …who are not getting medical help. 

00:03:25
WINNIE KING Well, I know something is minor, to us as adolescence getting a poor grade or may be breaking up with a boyfriend or girlfriend, trigger something like this? 

00:03:35
ALEC L. MILLER Well, there is an… there is an article that said; "Kid kills himself over bad grades." And well, at first blush that may appear to be a possibility, it’s not true. And I want to reassure all the teachers and parents and students out there that that’s not a possibility. You need to have… It’s a complicated issue. You need to have some predisposing condition such as a psychiatric disorder, like depression, like substance abuse, like a conduct disorder, and then in combination with some precipitating event, some stressor. 

00:04:05
WINNIE KING Well, let’s talk about those stressors, because if you got a teenager that has one or two of those predisposing problems like depression… 

00:04:10
ALEC L. MILLER Uh…Huh… 

00:04:10
WINNIE KING …what kinds of stressors would push them into suicide? 

00:04:15
ALEC L. MILLER , PsyD Adolescent Depression & Suicide Program The most common precipitant or stressor is an interpersonal confident, with a boyfriend, with a parent, either school disciplinary crisis, ah… other concerns to take into account or the family member is suicidal or if a friend is suicidal, those are also serious risk factors. 

00:04:30
WINNIE KING Well, Amanda you were just nodding your head. You had stressors in your life that you think triggered you to try and hurt yourself? 

00:04:35
AMANDA PELLICIER Yeah, there were like (inaudible ) umm… I would get into arguments with my brother. And most of the time, I didn’t even remember afterward what was going on, what… what it was about. I just got so angry and it led to what I was already feeling or my parents arguing. It was different things that… 

00:04:50
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:04:50
AMANDA PELLICIER …would seem normal to everyone else, but it would lead me to what I was already feeling. 

00:04:55
WINNIE KING Well now just before you would actually try to take your own life, what were you feeling? What are you thinking at that moment? 

00:05:00
AMANDA PELLICIER It was usually just some tired of it all, and I just wanted all to end, and I want the relief of knowing that it's… that the pain is gonna to end. I was in an impulse and anger a lot. 

00:05:15
WINNIE KING So, you actually came up with a plan and you knew that it was there and you… you told me that that gave you some comfort, knowing that you had a plan in place? 

00:05:20
AMANDA PELLICIER Right, just to know that it was all gonna end soon. I just had a few more things to do and then the life on this earth and the pain that I feel is gonna be gone and that was a lot of relief, you need to know. 

00:05:35
WINNIE KING Well Alec, we all… all the worry about whether… what’s going on in the mind of a teen? You know, do they typically give us warning signs when they are contemplating something like this? 

00:05:45
ALEC L. MILLER There are often warning signs and unfortunately we miss them, both verbally and non-verbally. I think, we need to be aware of some of them that are common. Some of the common warning signs, especially for depression includes… 

00:05:50
WARNING SIGNS •Sadness or down mood •Feeling hopeless •Talk of suicide or death “I wish I were never born” “I wish I were dead” “I won’t need this anymore” “My parents won’t have to worry about me anymore” “Everyone would be better off if I were dead” “Nobody cares if I live or die” •Change in appetite •Giving away possessions •Sudden change of mood •Aggressive behavior 

00:05:50
ALEC L. MILLER …sad or depressed mood, hopelessness in terms of talking of suicide or death. Sometimes teenagers would say; “I wish I were never born, I wish I were dead, I wish I don’t wanna be here anymore”. They'll often sometimes talk about; “Everyone would be better off if I were dead, and my family would be relieved if I were dead”. So we have to be aware of that. In terms of other warning signs, changes in appetite or sleep, both either increases or decreases. Another warning sign is giving away favorite possessions. I get very concerned if someone gives the way their favorite shirt, their favorite TV, video game, or a certain music that’s important to them. Sudden changes in mood, they might be depressed for a while and all of a sudden they become elated and that’s a worrisome sign, as well as aggressive behavior, fighting and arguing more and more. 

00:06:40
WINNIE KING Yeah. Well, Amanda you mentioned that you actually gave some things away, tell us about that. 

00:06:45
AMANDA PELLICIER I am… My… My twin sister Suzanne, I gave away a lot of my clothes to her. I told her; "Listen, if anything ever happens to me", I kind of hinted maybe something might happen to me. I gave her some of my favorite dolls and my favorite clothes. I would tell my mother ah… if I die, this is how I wanna, you know be buried by cremation and stuff. I would tell her. 

00:07:05
WINNIE KING So, you’re actually giving your family hints on how you'd wanna be cared for… 

00:07:10
AMANDA PELLICIER Yeah. 

00:07:10
WINNIE KING …after you died? 

00:07:10
AMANDA PELLICIER And… And every… I would start the sentence out by; If anything ever happens to me." And I'd tell them that I wanted the so and so to happen to me. 

00:07:20
WINNIE KING No, when you were saying that, deep down inside were you hoping that they would hear your pain and say; Wait a minute, why are you talking about something like that? Let’s get you some help. Were you actually saying those things to get them to pay attention to how you are feeling… 

00:07:30
AMANDA PELLICIER I think that was… 

00:07:30
WINNIE KING …or did you really want them to do that? 

00:07:35
AMANDA PELLICIER I really wanted them to do it just in case I was actually going go through with it, but there was also a part of me that wanted them to realize; Hey, there is something wrong. She keeps talking about that. 

00:07:45
WINNIE KING Well, you know Alec what… what Amanda is saying raises huge red flags with me just hearing her say that, but sometimes ah… we know that there are teens that can be somewhat what we call Drama Queens, you know they say those things and they don’t really mean it for say, they are just trying to get attention because they are frustrated. As a parent, how do you figure out when it's real? 

00:08:00
ALEC L. MILLER As you mentioned, some cases are just as a… a form of expression, say I wish I was… I was dead. But you have to take into a broader context and as Amanda is saying, there has to be other symptoms that you need to be aware of and other behaviors that need to be ah… warning signs for families and peers and teachers to look into. So I think, you don’t wanna take one symptom out of context. You wanna look it as a whole thing and may be ah… refer for consultation to make sure that the adolescence is okay. 

00:08:30
WINNIE KING Well, and you also have the teen that says; "Oh, I’m fine!" You know, here, take all of my clothes, take everything and prepare for my funeral… 

00:08:35
ALEC L. MILLER Right. 

00:08:35
WINNIE KING …but I’m… I’m fine. To… You would say to a parent, they are not fine? 

00:08:40
ALEC L. MILLER I would say they are not fine and I think that… that particular behavior wants a lot more inquiry. And I think parents need to be direct, ask the questions clearly. I think there is a myth that if you bring it up ah… that you'll plant the idea and then they'll act on 'em. That is not true. If someone is thinking about it, you're not gonna… it's not gonna get them further along. So please be direct and… And don’t be shocked if… if ah… if the adolescent says, I’m thinking about suicide. I think, family members don’t have to be horrified but say, wow, this is something serious and I wanna get you some help. 

00:09:10
WINNIE KING Yeah. What would you say are the more common ways the teens approach ah… taking their own lives? 

00:09:15
ALEC L. MILLER In terms of completed suicide the most common method is firearms. Over 60% of all ages and both genders. 

00:09:20
WINNIE KING Really? 

00:09:20
ALEC L. MILLER In terms of suicidal attempts, over-dosing on pills and… 

00:09:25
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:09:25
ALEC L. MILLER …cutting behaviors are most common. 

00:09:25
WINNIE KING And Amanda, you actually engaged in cutting behaviors, tell us about that. There is people watching that cutting, what do you mean cutting, cutting what, what… what exactly happened? 

00:09:35
AMANDA PELLICIER Harming myself umm… using may be a knife and basically anything I could find a knife or safety pin even. And when I tried to kill myself, I had heard on TV somewhere and then I just remembered it that if you cut your wrist in a certain way you can bleed to death. So, I tried that. Then there was also pills. 

00:09:50
WINNIE KING Now, what was it like for you when you were cutting yourself? Because you said initially, you… you burned yourself to start out with, with an iron I you didn’t even feel it? 

00:10:00
AMANDA PELLICIER I didn’t feel it. And then, when I tried cutting myself I… It was something of interested me. I just started getting interested and I started cutting myself. And when I started to go in deeper, I would feel it. And the pain, the physical pain, it was so different from the other pain. It was a… It was a distraction almost. And I just got addicted to it, like… like a drug may be. 

00:10:20
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:10:20
AMANDA PELLICIER And it gets away from the pain. 

00:10:20
WINNIE KING I mean what was it like when you actually cut yourself in blood? 

00:10:25
AMANDA PELLICIER Relief. 

00:10:25
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:10:25
AMANDA PELLICIER It’s… It’s very strange to say, but inside of me I thought relief. 

00:10:30
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:10:30
AMANDA PELLICIER So… Something else to think about, something else to feel… 

00:10:35
WINNIE KING Other than the pain… 

00:10:35
AMANDA PELLICIER …other pain, yeah. 

00:10:35
WINNIE KING …that you were feeling. Now, what happened when you were actually found? Who found you? What did they do? 

00:10:40
AMANDA PELLICIER Umm… It happened several times, but most of the time it was my sister who found me. My twin sister, we share a bedroom. And what she would do, she… like maybe she saw the… the open capsules, the pills fall out or whatever and she would just run to my mom. There was a time when my mother wasn’t there, she just called 919 and the ambulance will come over and I go to the ER. 

00:11:00
WINNIE KING Where you actually unconscious or did you… Were you awake and knew what was going on? 

00:11:05
AMANDA PELLICIER There was… I was awake and knew what going on. But one time I actually was falling into unconsciousness. 

00:11:10
WINNIE KING Uh…Huh… 

00:11:10
AMANDA PELLICIER And I don’t even remember how I got to the hospital. But my sister tells me that she went to my mother. 

00:11:15
WINNIE KING Well Alec, this is the thing that parents are the most afraid of, coming into the bedroom and finding their child unconscious or bleeding from some type of self-inflected wound. What… What do you say? How do you handle that type of situation? 

00:11:30
ALEC L. MILLER Well hopefully, we’re gonna get attention before we get to that point. And I think, I want parents and… and… and schools to think about identifying these kids who are at risk before they get to point where they've already harmed themselves. But assuming that that's already happened… 

00:11:45
WINNIE KING Uh…Huh… 

00:11:45
ALEC L. MILLER …I would definitely get that child or adolescent to an emergency room immediately. And probably we have to call 919 to get some help. 

00:11:50
WINNIE KING Now, when you are… When you’re talking to a child that you suspect is heading down the road that Amanda has gone down, how do you talk to them? I mean, you… you don’t wanna scare them, but you wanna get the point across, being direct is one of the ways that you suggest? 

00:12:05
ALEC L. MILLER Being direct as I said. I think, the other thing is you need to be able to listen. You have to kind of ah… be able to accept what the individual is saying to you and also listen to non-judgmentally. 

00:12:10
WAYS TO HELP •Be willing to listen •Be non-judgmental •Offer hope of alternatives •Don't dare him to do it •Don’t be sworn to secrecy 

00:12:15
ALEC L. MILLER When we get anxious, I think we're prone to be judgmental. And it’s important not to do that. 

00:12:15
WINNIE KING Right, and you've also got some other ways that we can be helpful. 

00:12:20
ALEC L. MILLER Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:20
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:12:20
ALEC L. MILLER Okay. Umm… Listening and judge… non-judgmentalness as I mentioned are… are couple of ways. Some other ways are you wanna offer hope of alternatives. And I think, they often feel there is no way out, this is the only solution, there needs to be generating other solutions by loved ones. Don’t dare him to do it. I think, that's another mistake. I think, when families get overwhelmed; Oh, I do it already, you know, I don’t care anymore. And I think they get frustrated not knowing how to handle it, which is a very dangerous thing to do, don’t do that. 

00:12:50
WINNIE KING Yeah. 

00:12:50
ALEC L. MILLER And also don’t be sworn to secrecy. 

00:12:50
WINNIE KING Yeah, now talk about this sworn to secrecy issues, not only an issue with parents but also with other teenagers that know what’s going on. 

00:13:00
ALEC L. MILLER Exactly, I think teenagers turn to teenagers, their peers or their siblings first before they go to adults. And I… I wanna give a message to the adolescents out there, do not be sworn to secrecy. If you’re a real or a loved one tell them, I will not keep this as a secret that you wanna kill yourself. In fact, I’m gonna tell a caring adult so I get you help. And if the adolescent gets upset so be it. You wanna make sure you keep your friend alive. 

00:13:20
WINNIE KING And you also want them to know the importance of taking action and getting professional help. Let us about that. 

00:13:25
ALEC L. MILLER Well, the other thing is for families to know, is to make sure you take action by removing means of suicide. If there is a gun in the house make sure you get it out of the house. If there are pills get the pills out of the house. Secure the house for safety and finally, and most importantly make sure you get some professional help. 

00:13:40
WINNIE KING Uh…Huh… And that sounds very reasonable. But in the throws of all of this it can be really overwhelming for parents. You know as an ER doctor I’ve seen this scenario played out in the emergency room, where parents are just so frightened and overwhelmed, because they have no idea that their child was at this point. Going to the emergency room is a reasonable thing, isn’t it? 

00:14:00
ALEC L. MILLER Absolutely. 

00:14:00
WINNIE KING When things are at the point where you’re scared to death? 

00:14:00
ALEC L. MILLER Absolutely, when in doubt if you're that concerned about safety or there has been some overdose behavior, don’t hesitate. And hopefully from the emergency room you’ll get some good referrals to some qualified mental health professionals in your community. 

00:14:15
WINNIE KING Absolutely. Well, the ER can intervene. We can get some one, a counselor, some one to actually talk to the child, assess what’s going on and then get the right help. Amanda, in your… in your case what are you doing now, so that you don’t feel so depressed and suicidal? 

00:14:25
AMANDA PELLICIER Well, I… First I started with having a physiatrist and then I got to a group umm… Actually, he’s the colleague of Dr. Miller. 

00:14:35
WINNIE KING Uh…Huh… So you guys are very good friends. You've know each other for a while now? He's helped you? 

00:14:40
AMANDA PELLICIER Yeah, couple of years now. And there is something called the DBT skills, the DBT group. I had it once a week. 

00:14:45
WINNIE KING Now, what is that? What do you with that? 

00:14:45
AMANDA PELLICIER It’s a dialectical behavior therapy. And I basically, when… when depression takes over me I can’t do anything. So, I’m basically learning skills for life ah… 

00:14:55
WINNIE KING Uh…Huh… 

00:14:55
AMANDA PELLICIER Interpersonal skills, how to get along with my family when I am feeling like this? You know, how to get along with my friends? 

00:15:00
WINNIE KING Uh…Huh… 

00:15:00
AMANDA PELLICIER There is something called acceptance skills for activities or CE contributing. You know, umm… helping people love, so that I feel better about myself, you know. 

00:15:10
WINNIE KING Yeah. That's fabulous! Well, I just want you to ask you a question that I… I want the viewers to really listen to the answer from you to, why would you want parents who have children, who are potentially suicidal to know? What do you know that you want parents to know about this? 

00:15:30
AMANDA PELLICIER Umm… They’re scared. They’re very scared. They… I remember umm… me and my mother were going through hard times, because I was feeling a lot of tension and I would say things I did really mean to her. I… I didn’t feel like myself. I want the parents… I'd like the parents to know that they’re scared, they’re terrified and they just don’t know what to do. 

00:15:50
WINNIE KING And what would you say to teens that may be watching this show, who were considering hurting themselves, this occur to them, they may wanna do this? 

00:15:55
AMANDA PELLICIER Well, they’re just… They’re just as scared. The parents are just as scared and even when it seems like there is no hope left, there are lot of people who are out there you haven’t given up on them yet. 

00:16:10
WINNIE KING Yeah. Oh, that’s fabulous! Well, we’re so glad that you didn’t give up on yourself and that you’re here with us share this.
