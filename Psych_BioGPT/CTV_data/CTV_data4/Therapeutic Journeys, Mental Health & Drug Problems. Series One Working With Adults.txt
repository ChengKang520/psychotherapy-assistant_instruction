Interview One, Working in a Mental Health Agency: Anxiety and Speed Use 

00:00:00
Getting Started: Understanding the problem 

00:00:00
SANDY WILLIAMS So, Ali where would you like to start in terms of telling me why you're here today? 

00:00:30
ALI DALE Um, because my GP suggested that I should come. 

00:00:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. And why did she think that was a good idea? 

00:00:35
ALI DALE Well, I went to go see her about something else. But um, I'm finding I'm just not coping very well anymore. 

00:00:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. Right. So it sounds like you were coping better at some point but not so well now. 

00:00:50
ALI DALE Yeah. 

00:00:50
SANDY WILLIAMS What, what do you do Ali? 

00:00:50
ALI DALE I go to Union. 

00:00:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. And this is been recently that, that you've been not coping so well. 

00:01:00
ALI DALE Yeah, the last few months just gotten really bad. I just can't get anything done. I can't get my assignments done. 

00:01:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:01:05
ALI DALE I can't concentrate. I, I just can't do it. I can't get it done. 

00:01:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. So, it's been quite a lot that's made it difficult for you. 

00:01:15
ALI DALE Yeah, yeah. 

00:01:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Can you put your finger on anything that's happened in the last while that would be related to this. 

00:01:25
ALI DALE Um, yeah, it's been bad for the last six months. Um, I feel stupid really. It's you know, it's just not there. 

00:01:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay, so it sounds like something happened a while ago that's a little bit sensitive for you to talk about. 

00:01:40
ALI DALE Yeah. 

00:01:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Now, may be a good point for me just to remind you that what we talk about is absolutely confidential between us. 

00:01:50
ALI DALE Yep. 

00:01:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Unless, I felt that at some point I felt that you were seriously at risk. And then I might need to talk to someone else. But, but we would discuss that. Okay. 

00:01:55
ALI DALE Yeah, okay. 

00:02:00
SANDY WILLIAMS So, you look a little edgy now. What about you sit back in the chair and take a breath or two and start to tell as much as you feel comfortable to tell me at this point. 

00:02:10
ALI DALE I just feel so stupid, like it was my fault,so. Um, I was seeing this guy and I'd gone out with him a couple of times. And it was nice and everything. And I thought he was really nice, you know. But it wasn't serious or anything. And um, yeah we went to a bar because we're not, we went out, we went to a pub. And I had a few drinks, so I, you know, it was my own fault. And I was pretty drunk. 

00:02:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:02:45
ALI DALE And um, and yeah, we went back to his place and I had sex with him. And I, I just I didn't really want to, you know, but I know that it but it's uh, I didn't say no. 

00:03:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:03:05
ALI DALE So it's my fault and I think about that a lot. 

00:03:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So it sounds like it's something that when you look back you did, you didn't really want to be part of, part of what happened. 

00:03:15
ALI DALE Yeah, no, no, not really but he'd taken me out and I, I was the one that was drunk so, you know. 

00:03:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:03:25
ALI DALE You know. 

00:03:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Well, you know, we can talk a little more at some point about just how much responsibility you're, you're going to take for it. It sounds like your being pretty harsh on yourself because I guess he had some role on what happened or what might not of happened. Hmm? 

00:03:40
ALI DALE Yeah, but I actually didn't say no. That was so stupid. I don't know why it makes me feel so bad. 

00:03:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. Well, I think that's something we should talk about. 

00:03:55
[music] 

00:03:55
Exploring the Anxiety: I think I'm going crazy 

00:03:55
SANDY WILLIAMS May be at this point it would be good to give me a little more information about what's, what's happened to you since then that's lead you to say you're not coping. What's been happening with you that's been difficult? 

00:04:10
ALI DALE I just don't function and I don't know why, like it's stupid. Like um, the other day it was really weird, I was in class, I was a lecture theater. And, I had to go, I thought I was going to die. 

00:04:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:04:25
ALI DALE I , I just had this attack. 

00:04:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:04:30
ALI DALE Or something and I had to get out. 

00:04:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So tell me what happened to you. You got some physical? 

00:04:35
ALI DALE Yeah. 

00:04:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Symptoms. 

00:04:35
ALI DALE I just, I just starting getting, like my heart started feeling like it was going to go out of my chest. And I couldn't breathe, I just couldn't breathe. 

00:04:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:04:45
ALI DALE And just, I had to go. I felt like everything was closing me in. I just had to go. 

00:04:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. That's a pretty scary kind of incident to happen. 

00:04:55
ALI DALE Yeah, it was awful. 

00:04:55
SANDY WILLIAMS And it sounds to me like a pretty classic example of a panic attack. And that's usually happens when people have been, had a level of background anxiety for a while. It just a little something to, to tip you over the edge. And you could have a full blown experience. Which is kind of terrifying. 

00:05:15
ALI DALE Yep. 

00:05:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. I imagine that you had some other symptoms like um, your hands. 

00:05:20
ALI DALE Yeah. They're clammy all the time. 

00:05:20
SANDY WILLIAMS They're clammy all the time, I bet. Right. So, it does sound like quite a level of anxiety kind of humming along there in the background. But then have you had any more kind of episodes where it's been really kind of acute like it was in the lecture the other day? 

00:05:40
ALI DALE Um, that was the worst it's ever been. 

00:05:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:05:45
ALI DALE Um, and I just, it's more like I blanked out. Like I'm really anxious and I feel like I can't cope anymore, so. But I got to get work done. So, I sit down and I try and get work done. And then all this time goes and I don't really know where it goes. 

00:06:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. Again it sounds like a really classic kind of picture of anxiety. That you kind of, it's, it's almost as if everything freezes, you know. And you can't, you can't think clearly, you can't focus, you can't concentrate. You worried about your body. You keep kind of aware of all your physical symptoms. Does that sound like what's happening? 

00:06:25
ALI DALE Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think I'm going crazy. I mean look I'm in a crazy clinic, you know, like. 

00:06:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:06:30
ALI DALE You know. 

00:06:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Well, I would encourage you to actually focus on the fact that, you know, your GP thought that it might be useful to talk to someone. I don't think you're crazy for a moment. You, you're having what a lot of people suffer from, which is anxiety. An anxiety um, attack, um, with a lot of background anxiety. And one of the really nice things about anxiety is that it's treatable. We can do lots for you, okay. Don't think it's got anything with you being loopy or crazy, yeah. 

00:07:05
[music] 

00:07:05
Managing the Anxiety: It's like I'm waiting for it to happen 

00:07:10
SANDY WILLIAMS When you say you, you're not coping tell me what you've been doing to try and cope with some of these kinds of symptoms that you've had. 

00:07:15
ALI DALE Um, I've been trying. I don't like sleeping very much, alone. Um, because I have, yeah, I don't like it. So I try not to sleep. 

00:07:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Is that because you have dreams or? 

00:07:30
ALI DALE Yeah, I'm getting really bad nightmares. 

00:07:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:07:30
ALI DALE All the time. 

00:07:30
SANDY WILLIAMS About the same kind of incident or? 

00:07:35
ALI DALE Yeah, I see his eyes. And I know it's my fault, which is a stupid thing. I know I didn't say no. I know, I was drunk. It was my fault but I just have these awful dreams and I just feel awful. 

00:07:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm, right. So when you say don't sleep, you try not to sleep a lot. What, what else do you do that you do to try to manage your anxiety? 

00:08:00
ALI DALE Um, I'm trying to keep really, really busy. Yeah, so I try not to sit down for very long. I find it really hard. 

00:08:10
SANDY WILLIAMS If you sit down what happens? 

00:08:10
ALI DALE I get really anxious. 

00:08:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. So, it's kind of like you're chasing your tail. Aren't you. You know you keep busy, you keep on the go. That keeps your system kind of bubbling and boiling along and then you become aware of all that activity. And then you wonder if you're going to have another one of these attacks, is that? 

00:08:30
ALI DALE Yeah, yeah. And it's almost like I'm, I'm waiting for it to happen. 

00:08:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Exactly. Yeah. 

00:08:30
ALI DALE And I don't want it to happen. 

00:08:35
SANDY WILLIAMS No, it's a very unpleasant kind of pattern to get into. 

00:08:35
ALI DALE I made an idiot of myself in front of like 150 people. 

00:08:40
SANDY WILLIAMS You're really harsh on yourself aren't you? We've only been talking for like five minutes and you've already called yourself stupid, silly. 

00:08:50
ALI DALE Yeah, but everybody else can cope. Like everything was fine. 

00:08:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Everything was fine until this happened. 

00:08:55
ALI DALE Yeah. 

00:09:00
SANDY WILLIAMS And I think it's, I think we can help you get back to the point. And as far as everybody else in the world we're not really interested in them. We're interested in you. And how bad you've been feeling and what you want to do about it. 

00:09:10
[music] 

00:09:10
Raising the Issue of Substance Use 

00:09:10
SANDY WILLIAMS So, what else have you been doing to try and manage these anxious feelings? 

00:09:25
ALI DALE Um. 

00:09:25
SANDY WILLIAMS You've been seeing you GP. If I can just interrupt you for a bit. 

00:09:30
ALI DALE Yeah. 

00:09:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Have you, have you been taking any medication? 

00:09:35
ALI DALE No, no not medication from my GP. I tried, my friend gave me some sleeping pills for a while but I don't want to sleep, so I don't want them. 

00:09:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:09:45
ALI DALE So, yeah. 

00:09:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, sometimes people can have a glass or two of alcohol, or have a cone or two. Or you know, there might be some, somethings that you've done that help kind of soothe you in an attempt to get yourself settled. Have you, have you tried any, any? 

00:10:05
ALI DALE No, no, I mean I don't want to drink because that's what got me into trouble in the first place. 

00:10:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Okay. 

00:10:10
ALI DALE I don't want anything that slows me down because. 

00:10:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Because you feel like your not getting stuff done anyway. 

00:10:15
ALI DALE Yeah 

00:10:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:10:15
ALI DALE Um, I mean. 

00:10:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Are you worried about what you, what you might talk to me about here? 

00:10:30
ALI DALE Yeah. 

00:10:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. It sounds like you, we might be straying into the territory of things that are not legal. And if that's the case as long as you're not going to tell me that you've been committing enormous crimes in the pursuit of your substance, there's not going to be a problem. Yeah, it's really more important to talk about what's happening with you. Okay. 

00:10:45
ALI DALE Okay. So you're not going to have a go at me. 

00:10:50
SANDY WILLIAMS No. I'm interested in what you're doing that is not working for you and what we can do that can get things working better for you. 

00:11:00
ALI DALE Okay. Um, well I mean, of course I don't want to sleep so I want to get stuff done. I want to feel in control, so I take some speed. 

00:11:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:11:10
[music] 

00:11:10
Exploring Speed Use: It helps me feel in control 

00:11:10
SANDY WILLIAMS And what does the speed do for you that actually helps? 

00:11:20
ALI DALE It doesn't actually helps so much anymore, yeah. Um, but, it, it what keeps me awake so I don't have to sleep. 

00:11:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:11:30
ALI DALE Um, it helps me feel in control. 

00:11:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:11:30
ALI DALE You know, a bit more powerful I suppose. I don't have to think about it I can just get on with stuff. 

00:11:35
SANDY WILLIAMS That's a pretty common kind of description for people who, who use speed for the same kind of reasons you're talking about. Which is to manage some kind of difficulties that they've had. You know there are recreational uses as well. And then they have a little bit of fun and then that's their story. But it sounds like you've had quite a focus in using speed to help keep you awake to stop the dreams. 

00:12:00
ALI DALE Yeah. 

00:12:00
SANDY WILLIAMS To, to get you feeling more in control of the situation because the situation you had six months ago was one which you felt very much out of control. Mmm? 

00:12:10
ALI DALE Yep. 

00:12:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So, you sound like, it's kind of lost, losing a bit of its power to do those things for you recently. Is that right. 

00:12:20
ALI DALE Yep. 

00:12:20
SANDY WILLIAMS All right, so its got a bit of a downside to it now. 

00:12:25
ALI DALE Yeah. Well, I'm sort of tired of being out of control and I don't know what to do. 

00:12:30
SANDY WILLIAMS And I suspect it might be a bit of interaction going on here between you know, what's a very normal anxious response to being involved in an event that was pretty awful for you. A reaction to something that you didn't want to happen. That you feel pretty bad about. And you've been using speed, which unfortunately can have some of the same kind of reactions. So, so there's a bit of a spiral effect that could be going on here. That's a bit self-defeating. 

00:13:00
ALI DALE Yep. 

00:13:00
SANDY WILLIAMS So, it might be, worth us taking a closer look at, you know how much speed you're using and how often. And looking at whether we can peg that back a bit at the same time as helping you manage some of your anxiety symptoms. 

00:13:20
[music] 

00:13:20
Interview Two, Working in an Alcohol and Drug Agency: Depression and Alcohol Use 

00:13:20
Presenting Problem: It's just another person to see 

00:13:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Hi, Peter. You look pretty flat and low. So, were do you want to start in terms of telling me why you're here. 

00:13:35
PETER WRIGHT My doctor sent me here. 

00:13:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Your doctor sent you. Okay. How do you feel about being sent here. 

00:13:40
PETER WRIGHT It's just another person to see. 

00:13:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, so you've seen quite a few people about whatever the problem is. Um, can you tell me a little bit about the problem. I know that's going to be a bit tedious for you but I would like to be able to do what I can to help you and I'm going to need you to tell me something about um, what brings you here. So if you could bare me that process maybe how I can be of help to you. And you make a decision of where you want to go with that. Does that sound all right? Okay. 

00:14:15
PETER WRIGHT My doctor thinks I'm drinking to much. 

00:14:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. 

00:14:25
PETER WRIGHT I don't think I am. 

00:14:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So your doctor's noticed some change. I mean, do you know you're doctor quite well. I mean how? 

00:14:30
PETER WRIGHT Yes, I see him every week. 

00:14:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, so, that's quite intensive, isn't it. Is there some reason that you, you don't see him every week about your drinking? 

00:14:40
PETER WRIGHT No. 

00:14:40
SANDY WILLIAMS No, what, what do you see about? 

00:14:45
PETER WRIGHT I had an accident. I hurt a nerve in my arm. 

00:14:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. How, how long ago was that. 

00:14:50
PETER WRIGHT About seven months ago. 

00:14:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Well, that's quite recent if you obviously still recovering from that? 

00:15:00
PETER WRIGHT Yes. 

00:15:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Can you tell me a little bit about the, the accident and what happened to you? 

00:15:10
PETER WRIGHT I just got hurt and it just changed my life. 

00:15:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. So. 

00:15:15
PETER WRIGHT What can I do? 

00:15:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So up into the accident your life was cruising along, there weren't no major problems in your life. 

00:15:25
PETER WRIGHT No It was all cruising 

00:15:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, and then this thing happens and there's been a whole set of changes and consequences for you. 

00:15:35
PETER WRIGHT Yes. 

00:15:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Um, what does your, what does your doctor think that you need in terms of you coming here. 

00:15:50
PETER WRIGHT He wants me to stop the drinking so the medication will work better. 

00:15:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, so thinks the drinking is interfering with the medication. Right, what do you think about that? 

00:16:00
PETER WRIGHT Well, the drinking helps me. 

00:16:10
[music] 

00:16:10
Assessing and Exploring Motivation 

00:16:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Can you tell me how, how it helps, Peter. Because there's a lot of different ways in which people find using a bit of alcohol helpful. 

00:16:20
PETER WRIGHT I find it relaxing. I find it takes away the pain. 

00:16:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:16:30
PETER WRIGHT And it keeps people off my back. 

00:16:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So, it's quite useful isn't it on a number of fronts. 

00:16:35
PETER WRIGHT Yeah. 

00:16:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, it reduces the intensity of the pain? 

00:16:35
PETER WRIGHT A lot. 

00:16:40
SANDY WILLIAMS It kind of keeps people at bay, so they're not at you as much. 

00:16:40
PETER WRIGHT That's right. 

00:16:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Um, how much do you reckon you're drinking? I mean your doctors has kind of sent you here. He would of had a little bit concern about um, your drinking by the sounds of things. What, what are you drinking at the moment? 

00:17:00
PETER WRIGHT Jack Daniels. 

00:17:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. So, you like spirits, you prefer spirits. What do you reckon you're putting away at the moment? 

00:17:15
PETER WRIGHT Four maybe five bottles a week. 

00:17:15
SANDY WILLIAMS A week, right. Okay, so, it does sound like you're using quite a bit of alcohol to manage the problems you talked about. Um, we're you somebody who liked drinking before the accident? 

00:17:40
PETER WRIGHT Everyone likes to drink. 

00:17:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Of course, they do, yeah. We live in a culture where it's very much part of life, isn't it. What sort of work did you do? 

00:17:45
PETER WRIGHT I was a miner. So we had a drink after work. 

00:17:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Of course, yeah. It's much part of the culture isn't it. 

00:17:50
PETER WRIGHT Yeah. 

00:17:50
SANDY WILLIAMS And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. Um, so you, what, what would you call yourself kind of a social drinker before, before the accident. 

00:18:00
PETER WRIGHT Yeah. Good social drinker. 

00:18:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, okay. And what's happened to your drinking since the accident? 

00:18:10
PETER WRIGHT I just drink a little bit more that's all. 

00:18:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, it's just kind of crept up, you reckon. 

00:18:15
PETER WRIGHT Maybe. 

00:18:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:18:20
PETER WRIGHT Yeah, I suppose. 

00:18:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, right. 

00:18:25
PETER WRIGHT I don't know. 

00:18:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm, so, so what, what does it do for you? 

00:18:30
PETER WRIGHT It makes the day shorter. 

00:18:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. Kind of something to do. 

00:18:35
PETER WRIGHT Something to do like drink, I might sleep. 

00:18:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:18:40
PETER WRIGHT And wake up and may have another drink. 

00:18:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:18:45
PETER WRIGHT But no one's around. It's like your best friend. 

00:18:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, it's like a companion. 

00:18:55
PETER WRIGHT Yeah. 

00:18:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, company and a little ritual that you've got going for yourself. 

00:19:00
PETER WRIGHT Yeah. 

00:19:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So, it's part of feeling like you've got a little bit of structure and something to do with your day. Yeah. What does it, what does it do for you physically, you know. As it goes down, what does it do for you? 

00:19:15
PETER WRIGHT The first one or two are sharp. 

00:19:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:19:20
PETER WRIGHT But it gets warmer. 

00:19:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:19:20
PETER WRIGHT And after awhile you don't feel it. 

00:19:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:19:25
PETER WRIGHT So that's pretty good. 

00:19:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, yeah. And what does it do for your arm? Does it do anything with the pain? 

00:19:35
PETER WRIGHT You don't feel it after a while. 

00:19:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:19:40
PETER WRIGHT It's just numb like everything else, I suppose. 

00:19:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, so it serves a good purpose to numb things. 

00:19:45
PETER WRIGHT Great, great purpose. 

00:19:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Numbs, numbs the stress, numbs the pain, it does the job. 

00:19:50
PETER WRIGHT Yeah. 

00:19:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Your wife's obviously, you know, being a little bit concerned about that and so is your doctor. So that picked up some of the down side but they're outsiders looking in. From your own perspective what do you think are some of the not so good things about, about drinking. 

00:20:10
[sil.] 

00:20:10
PETER WRIGHT Um, I could be maybe a little bit more angry. I don't know, I don't know. 

00:20:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, right. So let's. 

00:20:20
PETER WRIGHT Less, less tolerant. 

00:20:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. That's a pretty absurd, absurd observation because alcohol plays a pretty important role and sometimes kind of taking a lid off things that maybe stewing in there And sometimes we can actually express things that we would normally we would be keeping the lid on a bit so. They could be happening. That's a pretty, a pretty wise observation, I think. And that's not like to be, to be like that? To be kind of reactive? 

00:20:55
PETER WRIGHT No, no. Not at all. 

00:21:00
[sil.] 

00:21:00
The Impact 

00:21:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Do you drink alone or with others or? 

00:21:10
PETER WRIGHT Alone. 

00:21:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Are you spending quite a lot of time alone? 

00:21:15
PETER WRIGHT All the time. 

00:21:15
SANDY WILLIAMS All the time. 

00:21:15
PETER WRIGHT Yeah. 

00:21:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Wow, that sounds pretty severe. So how does your wife feel about what's, what's happened? 

00:21:25
PETER WRIGHT We don't talk a lot any more. 

00:21:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. When you say any more has that been since the accident. 

00:21:35
PETER WRIGHT Yeah. 

00:21:35
SANDY WILLIAMS So that's part of the big changes that you've been dealing with. 

00:21:35
PETER WRIGHT A lot. Yeah, but you know, it's bad. 

00:21:40
SANDY WILLIAMS It's not? 

00:21:40
PETER WRIGHT It's not all bad? 

00:21:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. So between you, you're kind of still hanging in there despite this, these problems you had, is that what you're saying? 

00:21:55
PETER WRIGHT Well, no, I think she's going to leave me. 

00:22:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Oh, that's getting, that's getting pretty serious, isn't it. What would she, what would she tell me has brought her to start thinking about leaving? You know what? 

00:22:15
PETER WRIGHT What am I good for? I don't do a lot. My sex life's out the window. 

00:22:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:22:25
PETER WRIGHT I do nothing. 

00:22:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:22:30
PETER WRIGHT I'm becoming an invalid. 

00:22:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So there some really big changes that have happened to you? And she's, she's feeling that quite keenly. 

00:22:40
PETER WRIGHT Yeah. 

00:22:40
SANDY WILLIAMS And so are you, mm-hmm. And the drinking has kind of helped taking the edge off some of these difficulties, is that what you're saying. It's helped with the pain. It's helped some of the kind of friction or agitation between you. 

00:23:00
PETER WRIGHT Yeah, a lot. 

00:23:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So, no wonder its crept up a little bit, Peter. It makes imminent sense. I think that you've been trying to manage some of your difficulties on the home front as well as your doctor trying to help you. I think it's understandable. 

00:23:20
[music] 

00:23:20
Understanding the Function of Drinking 

00:23:20
SANDY WILLIAMS So, Peter if, if I had your wife here, what's your wife's name by the way? 

00:23:30
PETER WRIGHT Joan. 

00:23:30
SANDY WILLIAMS If Joan were here and I said to her, what, what's worrying you more about Peter. Is it his drinking or is it how changed he is as a person? What would you reckon she'd tell me? 

00:23:45
PETER WRIGHT I don't know, could be drinking. 

00:23:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:23:45
PETER WRIGHT She thinks I'm getting more angry. Do I look as though I'm getting angry? 

00:23:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Well, well, I could understand you have, having some pretty strong reactions to this. It sounds like this accident has really drawn a line in the sand between how you were as a person before. There's a really sharp difference. I'd like to explore that a bit more because I've got a hunch there's a pretty good explanation for, for how different you're feeling. Um, what, what sort of person were you before the accident? Can you take your mind back there and paint a picture for me. 

00:24:20
PETER WRIGHT Active. 

00:24:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So, you had. 

00:24:25
PETER WRIGHT I was involved, played golf, a bit of tennis. 

00:24:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:24:30
PETER WRIGHT We went out. When I was in the pith, you know, we'd go to restaurants. We don't do that know. 

00:24:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, so you had a pretty full life. As an individual you did things that absorbed you and interested you. And as a couple you did things. But most of that's faded out of the picture? 

00:24:55
PETER WRIGHT I can't do anything. 

00:24:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:24:55
PETER WRIGHT Stay at home. 

00:25:00
SANDY WILLIAMS And the reason that you stay at home, what, what, is it, do you have pain from this accident or do? 

00:25:05
PETER WRIGHT Pain, or an arm that you can't use. You can't go to the toilet. You can do up your shoelaces. 

00:25:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So, this is really attacked you as a man hasn't it. 

00:25:20
PETER WRIGHT Are you saying I'm not a man. 

00:25:20
SANDY WILLIAMS No, I guess I'm saying that each of us has an idea of who we are as a person and then something happens to us that we didn't invite, we didn't expect. And we suddenly feel like we're not the same person anymore. It really kind of strips us of who we are. 

00:25:35
PETER WRIGHT I suppose. 

00:25:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. I mean, I, I've suspect that you've been, as a man have been trying to find the best way possible to deal with what's happened to you. And maybe the drinking has been part of that. It's been one strategy that you've used. 

00:25:55
PETER WRIGHT The drinking's good. 

00:25:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:25:55
PETER WRIGHT The day gets, you know, you go through your day. 

00:26:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:26:00
PETER WRIGHT Slightly faster. You cope a little bit better. 

00:26:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, yeah. That makes sense. 

00:26:10
[music] 

00:26:10
Exploring Depression: It's like my life is going down the gurgler 

00:26:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Can I just stay for a moment though with some of the things that you are feeling now that you weren't feeling before, you know. Because I don't want to actually put too much of a spot light on the drinking. I think the drinking is uh, something you've been doing to help you cope. And I want to know what it is you're trying to cope with. Tell me about um, what, how you feel on a day to day basis if you weren't drinking? 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:26:40
PETER WRIGHT Lonely. 

00:26:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:26:45
PETER WRIGHT Um, my wife works so I'm at home. If I'm not going to a doctor, I'm at home. 

00:26:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:26:55
PETER WRIGHT I fall asleep on trains traveling backwards and forwards to doctors. 

00:27:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:27:00
PETER WRIGHT Um. 

00:27:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Are you sleeping at night? 

00:27:05
PETER WRIGHT I don't sleep. 

00:27:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. 

00:27:05
PETER WRIGHT Get by, by who knows, one or two hours may be. 

00:27:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:27:10
PETER WRIGHT At the best. 

00:27:10
SANDY WILLIAMS So your sleeps go quite interrupted or you go to sleep only once and then wake up and can't get go back to sleep or. 

00:27:15
PETER WRIGHT I just don't get back to sleep. 

00:27:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. What's, what's happened to your appetite? You, are you eating less or eating more? Is that changed at all? 

00:27:30
PETER WRIGHT Yeah, I've got used to the chips. Chips and the drink. It's not bad. 

00:27:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:27:40
PETER WRIGHT No, probably not eating less. 

00:27:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. 

00:27:40
PETER WRIGHT Nothings the same. 

00:27:45
SANDY WILLIAMS No, of course not. And you said, that, that you felt angry at times, you know? Are there other feelings you have at times? 

00:27:55
[sil.] 

00:28:00
PETER WRIGHT I don't know. It's just like your life's going down the gurgler. 

00:28:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:28:05
PETER WRIGHT Except you know, I was 35, I had a life. What have I got now? 

00:28:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:28:10
PETER WRIGHT You have the answers, can you tell me where I'm going. I don't know. 

00:28:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Yeah. This is a huge change for you, isn't it. It's like the rest of your life is kind of staring you in the face with. And you're not sure what you can manage from here. 

00:28:30
[sil.] 

00:28:35
PETER WRIGHT I just got to try. 

00:28:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:28:35
PETER WRIGHT That's why I'm here. 

00:28:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. You know, it sounds to me, Peter. I don't know what your GP has, has suggested to you. But it sounds to me like you've been suffering from pretty severe depression, post-accident. And I wouldn't at all be surprised. And depression is actually a major threat to somebody's health, emotional and mental health. Mmm. And there are many people who don't realize they're suffering from depression. They just think they're in a mood and it's hard to snap out of it. But it's actually something that can be, be beyond your control. And I suspect that's what's happened. It would make a lot of sense. 

00:29:15
[music] 

00:29:15
The Way Forward 

00:29:15
SANDY WILLIAMS And there are things that, that can be done to help who are depressed. We're not going to perform miracles on your arm. I mean we haven't been into that in great detail. But there maybe some things that we can do along the way that may um, certainly help with your mood. I suspect there's probably an interaction with your drinking because it's a bit of a double-edge sword. When you're drinking creeps up it helps with the depression. But unfortunately, it kind of, it's, kind of a vicious circle. Um, it can actually produce um, and feed into the depression as well. So, you kind of end up sort of chasing your tail. Just sort of a bugger because it sort of works on the one hand and on the other hand it can actually compound the problem. So it might be that we need to look at both camps. Does that sort of make sense to you? 

00:30:15
PETER WRIGHT I suppose. 

00:30:20
SANDY WILLIAMS And perhaps the amount of golf(ph) you have, you know, until we have a closer look uh, kind of playing a role in you being different. If that makes sense. 

00:30:30
PETER WRIGHT I suppose it does make sense, Sand. 

00:30:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. What other things, you know, your wife's not obviously happy about the drinking. But what, what do you think the drinking's doing, what do you think the it's doing, in terms of your relationship. 

00:30:45
PETER WRIGHT We, we argue a lot. 

00:30:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:30:55
PETER WRIGHT She doesn't understand, you know. 

00:30:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:31:00
PETER WRIGHT I suppose we're not close anymore. Um, uh, in the bedroom. 

00:31:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. 

00:31:05
PETER WRIGHT We don't go out. 

00:31:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:31:10
PETER WRIGHT But that could be her fault. Is it always my fault? 

00:31:15
SANDY WILLIAMS I think you're right. I think that when sometime big like this happens to people it changes both of you. It changes everybody. 

00:31:20
PETER WRIGHT That's what I thought. 

00:31:25
SANDY WILLIAMS So, I think this, if you're having relationship problems that's a shared problem. It's not just your problem. 

00:31:30
PETER WRIGHT Yeah. 

00:31:30
SANDY WILLIAMS And may be it might be good at some point for Joan to come in and, and see somebody and perhaps, perhaps the three of us could do something to help in terms of some of that. Do you think she would be open to that? 

00:31:45
PETER WRIGHT She'd love it. 

00:31:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Would she, why do you say that? 

00:31:50
PETER WRIGHT She can say what she wants to say about me. 

00:31:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So one concern might, of yours might be just kind of spill her guts about how difficult you've been to be with. 

00:32:05
PETER WRIGHT Wouldn't you. Yeah, I suppose. 

00:32:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. You're saying you understand that for her it's been difficult a bit or? 

00:32:20
PETER WRIGHT Maybe. 

00:32:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Well you seem pretty, you seem pretty sensitive to me to a lot of the changes that this accident has brought. You know, to you and to your relationship. And that's, that's a pretty good start in terms of thinking of maybe we can do something together, in terms of your depression. Maybe starting to bring your drinking down a bit, more to the level that it was before the accident. When there didn't seem to be any major problems. Mmm. And maybe we can do something on the relationship front too. It's probably, you know, Joan maybe, maybe feeling build up with some things as, as well as your self. Mmm. Hard time for both of you. 

00:33:05
PETER WRIGHT Yeah. It is. 

00:33:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. 

00:33:15
PETER WRIGHT And she'd probably like the chance to talk. 

00:33:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right.
