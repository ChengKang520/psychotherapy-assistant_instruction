BRIEF THERAPY INSIDE OUT with Jon Carlson, Psy.D., Ed.D. Professor of psychology & Counseling and Diane Kjos, Ph.D. Professor of Psychology & Counseling 

00:01:15
JON CARLSON All therapy attempts to be brief. Brief Therapy clearly identifies as a therapeutic focus and goal and then strives to reach that goal in a time limited, efficient, and systematic fashion. This series brings together the leading strategist in the area of Brief Therapy. Each will demonstrate their approach with real people with real life problems.

WORKING WITH EATING DISORDERS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY ART FREEMAN THERAPIST 

00:01:55
JON CARLSON Hi, I am Jon Carlson. Welcome to another session of our series, Brief Therapy Inside Out. 

00:02:00
DIANE KJOS And I am Diane Kjos, and this is our guest Art Freeman, who is going to talk to us about his approach to Brief Therapy. Alright, just what does Brief Therapy mean to you? 

00:02:10
ART FREEMAN COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPIST Brief Therapy is not a number of sessions, Brief Therapy is a way of conceptualizing therapy, a way of developing a therapeutic relationship. It’s a number of aspects. It's directive, it's active, it's focused, it's solution-oriented, it's psycho-educational. It's lots of things done in the limited time that one can use. 

00:02:40
JON CARLSON What is your particular strategy or approach to Brief Therapy? Just… How does that work? 

00:02:45
ART FREEMAN My basic orientation comes out of my work in cognitive therapy and cognitive therapy and brief therapy are really synonymous. Cognitive therapy has always been a brief therapy and so… 

00:02:55
JON CARLSON Cognitive is like the thinking, focused on thoughts? 

00:03:00
ART FREEMAN Looking at thinking and using our broad family name cognitive behavioral therapy, looking at the way people think, looking at the way they behave, looking at the way they feel, feel how these all interact. 

00:03:10
JON CARLSON And just how does that work? How do you operate as a cognitive behavioral therapist, brief therapist? 

00:03:20
ART FREEMAN Well, one of the things we'd look out is how people understand their world, how people develop their ideas, how people see themselves in the context of their world, then helping them to understand where these ideas come from, how they affect their interactions and basically how they can learn to take better control of their lives. 

00:03:45
DIANE KJOS What… What are the looks of the basis of this approach and… and… and what influenced you to adopt this approach to your therapy? 

00:03:50
ART FREEMAN I think, cognitive behavioral therapy has two distinct roots, one is dynamic root that goes back to the work of Freud, more specially the work of Alfred Adler. It also has a very strong behavioral root, looking at the work of Andrew Salter, Jacobson, Joseph Wobby certainly, and cognitive behavioral therapy really serves as a… a meeting point for people from diverse schools, because I think it has a strong dynamic component and the strong behavioral component. What influenced me is that it works and we have lots of data that says it works and that… that’s the best influence for why I do what I do. 

00:04:30
JON CARLSON Just how does change occur in this process out? 

00:04:35
ART FREEMAN That’s a hard question Jon. Change occurs as we can understand the basic schema as… as one aspect of it, the basic rules we live by. 

00:04:45
JON CARLSON I'm not sure what you mean. 

00:04:50
ART FREEMAN Each one of us learn certain rules of life, cultural rules, social rules, religious rules, family rules, and the influence how we thing, how we behave and how we feel, so that change occurs as we start to understand something of the rules we live by. Now, change also occurs as we direct the change behavior, because if you've been doing something in certain way all of these years and you change it, it may also change the strength of your belief that I can’t change. 

00:05:20
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

00:05:20
JON CARLSON So, it begins with one way to bring about change is through, you call understanding or may be insight and then another is by actually doing? 

00:05:30
ART FREEMAN Right. 

00:05:30
DIANE KJOS Something different. 

00:05:30
JON CARLSON Doing something different? 

00:05:30
ART FREEMAN While we discover that insight in and of itself is not sufficient for change. That the fact that you have great insight, it doesn’t mean that you've developed the skills to change. So I have developed great insight into my gulf swing. I am the insight as I do it wrong, but unless I can learn how to do it right, that insight is not going to improve my game at all. 

00:05:50
DIANE KJOS So, just knowing why, your… this is going on your life isn’t enough to change it? 

00:05:55
ART FREEMAN It’s not sufficient, it's interesting and important but not sufficient. 

00:06:00
JON CARLSON So, as a brief therapist how do you bring about change? What are you focusing on? 

00:06:05
ART FREEMAN I… I think two aspects are the directive nature of what I do, that the idea I have is that if the client and I are in my consulting room one of us has to have an idea of where we are going. And I think that's got to be the therapist, because if the client who they were going that I wouldn’t be going to see us that they will be doing other things with their time, with their money. So, that’s one piece. The other part is the activity of the client. They have to be willing and able to make a commitment to change, which is very simple. I'm willing to try to change. If they can’t do that or won’t do that, then I think brief therapy or long-term therapy won’t be very effective. 

00:06:50
JON CARLSON So there is two parts in your really being able to take charge and to direct the change process. 

00:07:00
ART FREEMAN To structure it, yeah. 

00:07:00
JON CARLSON To structure it and then the willingness on the part of the… the client. So, people would call mandated clients wouldn’t really work in this approach, people who don’t want to be there, people who the coach are sending? 

00:07:15
ART FREEMAN I am often asked that Jon. I am working with a client who doesn’t want to be there, doesn’t like therapy, doesn’t like therapist, the court has… has said either go to therapy or go to jail and they always pick therapy interestingly. How do I make them change? And the answer is you don’t. So a mandated client who comes in and says, you know this drug habit is getting the best of me I need to change it. My abusive behavior towards my spouse has got to stop. My antisocial activities have got to come to an end so I can build my life. They are very workable. The first one comes in and says, do me something, change me. I… I think it will be in long-term therapy with them forever and there still won't be change. 

00:08:00
DIANE KJOS So motivation is a key there isn’t it? 

00:08:05
ART FREEMAN I think motivation is a key for all therapies. 

00:08:05
DIANE KJOS How does this compare with other brief approaches? 

00:08:10
ART FREEMAN That’s a hard question to answer Diane. It… It depends whose brief approach. There are many brief approaches, some very close to what I do. I've watched other brief therapists, I've read of other brief therapists and very often we're doing the same thing we call it different things. I think the elements to brief therapy are very, very similar. I think the structure is essential, a real focus is essential, a real collaboration is essential, the directive nature is essential. Doing non-directive free associative work… 

00:08:50
DIANE KJOS Isn't brief! 

00:08:50
ART FREEMAN It can't be brief by definition. So, I think there are lots of similarities. I think what makes what I do may be different from others, not all others, is the cognitive behavioral focus, and that doesn’t exclude emotion, clearly if someone is depressed you want to change their depression, but the way into the system is understand in the way they think, process information and certainly how they behave. 

00:09:20
JON CARLSON I'm intrigued by this, the… the notion of the structure. Just how do you structure an interview? Are there steps or stages that you go through? 

00:09:30
ART FREEMAN Well, yeah, there's a beginning, middle and end. 

00:09:35
JON CARLSON Okay, talk about that. 

00:09:35
ART FREEMAN Yeah! The beginning is involved in developing rapport is essential, good therapy is good therapy and a relationship is an essential piece. The brief therapist has to be especially skilled at developing a relationship fairly quickly that you don’t have months to develop the relationship. 

00:10:00
JON CARLSON So you… So you quickly engage… 

00:10:00
ART FREEMAN Quickly engage. 

00:10:05
JON CARLSON …the… the client, right? 

00:10:05
ART FREEMAN Yeah! Then to develop a problem list. That developing a problem list that is very focused is essential. One of the bywords for what I do is that vague goals lead to vague therapy and vague therapy leads to vague results. So, I try to avoid things like, I want to work on my self-esteem, it's too vague. I am having communication problems at home, too vague. So, very early in the session I want to try to focus to get definitions, understandings, but to really focus. The mid part of the session is developing the theme. With about five minutes left to go in the session, what I want to do is then bring the session to a close. I don’t want to be abrupt I'm several times up for today. I want to give the client time to come back together to review the session. What did you learn? What are you taking home with you? So that the session isn’t just something that rolls along but that, I've gotto responsibility for maintaining a structure and a focus. 

00:11:25
JON CARLSON As you begin with this rapport, relationship and you set up a problem list, is there anything more with the problems, is there where you make an intervention? 

00:11:35
ART FREEMAN My… Part of it is finding out what we can work on. So, if for example the patient says, the… the problems I wanna work on are famine and (inaudible ) and next we… we can work on plague. I have to say, that’s too broad, too vague, can we shorten it? 

00:11:50
JON CARLSON So, what does plague mean to you? 

00:11:50
ART FREEMAN Yeah! 

00:11:50
JON CARLSON And take it from their… So, then… then there is going to be some kind of… of focusing on one of those problems and then the third step is to come back, bringing back someone to reality, putting some closure on… 

00:12:05
ART FREEMAN Right, exactly! 

00:12:05
JON CARLSON …that particular session? 

00:12:05
ART FREEMAN Closure on the session and closure on our contact for this week. So, it really it's important to put things back together rather than just leave someone wide open, yeah. 

00:12:20
DIANE KJOS Okay! 

00:12:20
JON CARLSON Is there any research support for this? I mean, does it work? 

00:12:25
ART FREEMAN I think there’s a lot of empirical data about cognitive therapy starting with the late 70s do that would work on depression, there has been a huge amount of work on anxiety or the other work on depression by Beck, the work on anxiety by David Clark, Paul Salkovskis at Oxford. The work on cognitive behavioral approaches with PTSD, Edna Foa, the work on personality disorders, the work Beck and others have done. So, there is a huge body of data that talks to the issue of cognitive behavioral approaches as brief and empirically validated. 

00:13:05
JON CARLSON I see. 

00:13:05
DIANE KJOS You talked about this need for motivation, for change, other… others… other than that with their clients that this just doesn’t work with or are there specific kinds of clients that it works better with than others. 

00:13:20
ART FREEMAN If you would have asked me that question in 1978, I would have said we worked with depression because that’s what we did. I would say, at this point, cognitive behavioral approaches are a general model for treatment that we’ve seen cognitive therapy work as a pain management technique, as a work with couples, families, inpatients, outpatients, children I would think that with modification, a cognitive behavioral approach would be useful with a broad range of clients, broad range of settings, a broad range of modalities. Does it work better with some than others? Yes, depending how you structure it. So, for example, if I was working with an individual with severe problems, I’d be using, excuse me, more behavioral than cognitive. It's just… just… 

00:14:20
DIANE KJOS Oh okay! So, you're making some shifts, basically? 

00:14:20
ART FREEMAN …talks to how you structure the broad repertoire of cognitive behavioral work. 

00:14:25
DIANE KJOS What about cultural differences? 

00:14:30
ART FREEMAN Cognitive therapy cross-culturally as a short-term model has been very popular. I… I’ve done a good bit of traveling and one indication is that, I’ve had books in cognitive therapy translated into my languages and its always interesting that people in Sweden say, they like cognitive therapy because it fits into the Swedish cultural style and people in China say they like cognitive therapy, because it fits with the Chinese cultural style and the reason is, cognitive therapy, as a basic approach is not content-oriented but process-oriented. 

00:15:05
DIANE KJOS Okay! 

00:15:05
ART FREEMAN So, it's not that we have, there is an (inaudible ) complex that may not be cross-cultural. The goal is to help someone in their culture understand the rules or schema of their culture and how it affects their lives. So, it’s a process. 

00:15:20
JON CARLSON It might be easier to… to maybe to understand this approach by watching you work and in a minute we’re gonna watch you work with a… a real person with real issues named Karla. Can you talk little bit about what you were thinking before you met with Karla? 

00:15:45
ART FREEMAN Well, I started with some basic information so I knew that she was a teacher. I knew her age and that she had recently broken up a relationship. That’s essentially what I started with. And I started to develop hypothesis, basic hunches about this relationship the issue what broke up their relationship, what cause the difficulties, is it a work related issue? So, I’ve got a number of questions some questions, of course, a suicide issue always a question its hopelessness in issue and that would be a part of suicidal question, but I have a number of hypothesis and part of what I'll be doing as I work with Karla is testing out my hypothesis and collect data and test out my ideas to see if the data supports my hypothesis. 

00:16:40
JON CARLSON And this is one session here as we and… and… and then I assume she'll be followed up with someone after this or is this gonna be it, this is all the therapy she’ll need? 

00:16:50
ART FREEMAN No, I think that this is one session and there'll be of course follow-up afterwards where certainly some of the problems that we’ll be discussing need to be followed up, because of the nature of those difficulties and certainly the… the important part. 

00:17:10
DIANE KJOS Okay! Well, I'm anxious to see this. 

00:17:10
JON CARLSON Yeah, me too. 

00:17:15
DIANE KJOS Why don’t we go to the videotape and see how it goes. 

00:17:20
ART FREEMAN Hi Karla. 

00:17:20
KARLA ROGERS Hi. 

00:17:25
ART FREEMAN Thanks for doing this and I appreciate your being here and doing this. How do you feel about doing it? 

00:17:30
KARLA ROGERS Umm… I've had different therapy sessions before. I've seen different counselors and, you know, I’m open for this. This is… 

00:17:40
ART FREEMAN Open for this? Okay! We’ve got 45 minutes. Maybe a good place for us to begin Karla is why you are here? And what would you like to get out of the time we have? 

00:17:55
KARLA ROGERS 45 minutes? 

00:18:00
ART FREEMAN At least we can start to make a list. 

00:18:00
KARLA ROGERS Okay! (inaudible ) list. I recently sort of gained control of my life. I’ve started my career as an art teacher, starting to get back on my feet after a relationship that dissolved and there’s still like a few issues, a few things that I think I need to deal with, come face-to-face with so that this process keeps moving forward instead of holding me back. 

00:18:40
ART FREEMAN What are some of the problems… getting control your life, that sounds great. Recovering from a relationship, that’s in the plus column. What are the kinds of things that you wanna get face-to-face with? 

00:18:55
KARLA ROGERS Umm… The… I'm… I'm sure it started, but before that, but the relationship kind of left me with quite a low self-esteem to the point where I would say it contributed a great deal to an eating disorder. 

00:19:20
ART FREEMAN The eating disorder of being what? 

00:19:25
KARLA ROGERS Well, I'm… I'm multi-talented that way. Yeah, I’m anorexic, bulimic, just kind of both, it depends… depends on the day. 

00:19:40
ART FREEMAN Some days you won't eat at all and… 

00:19:40
KARLA ROGERS Basically, what I’ll do is, I won't eat for like two or three days and then I’ll reward myself for doing such a great job of not eating for two or three days and then I’ll go and just peg out, then I’ll throw it up or whatever. So then… 

00:20:05
ART FREEMAN What’s whatever? 

00:20:05
KARLA ROGERS Laxatives umm… whatever! And this has been going on you know for a… for a while and it's getting to the point where a lot more people notice it. I used to be really good at it and you know people would say, "oh you look so thin, you look so nice and healthy!" And that's just like, I mean, I was killing myself and… 

00:20:30
ART FREEMAN It's a one-piece that we can talk about is getting control of the eating problems. 

00:20:40
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:20:40
ART FREEMAN And the other piece you're talking about in related to the eating problems is getting control of how you feel about yourself. 

00:20:45
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:20:45
ART FREEMAN What else is on that list Karla? 

00:20:50
[sil.] 

00:20:55
KARLA ROGERS I guess there's… there's probably so many more things under that. I mean, there's… I think there are so many more things that may be I just don’t know about yet. It’s kind of like I feel like… 

00:21:05
ART FREEMAN In… In which category? 

00:21:10
KARLA ROGERS With my… myself… my self-esteem, how I relate to people, you know, I don’t get too close to people, I don’t, you know, I… I keep my relationships very, I don’t bring people too much into my… my world or too close to me, probably because I feel like I’m gonna lose that person, you know. 

00:21:35
ART FREEMAN Like keeping safe. 

00:21:40
KARLA ROGERS Like keeping, you know, you keep safe. 

00:21:40
ART FREEMAN Okay. Now, you said that eating disorder has been going on for a while. 

00:21:45
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:21:45
ART FREEMAN A while is how long? 

00:21:50
KARLA ROGERS I mean, I've done this since I was a teenager and… but it got to the point where… 

00:21:55
ART FREEMAN A teenager 13, 18? 

00:22:00
KARLA ROGERS Probably since I was about 15. 

00:22:05
ART FREEMAN So, the eating stuff started when you’re about 15, you are now 27, so it’s been going on for 12 years? 

00:22:10
KARLA ROGERS It's been going on for 12 years and… and then this past year I had a… I went to the doctors, because it got to the point that my body was just starting to just give up, you know, and it was a kind of wakeup call. 

00:22:30
ART FREEMAN I bet it was. 

00:22:30
KARLA ROGERS Yeah… Yeah, throw up blood in… in that pizza and it’s kind of a… a wakeup call. 

00:22:40
ART FREEMAN It sounds like more than a wakeup call. 

00:22:40
KARLA ROGERS Yeah. 

00:22:40
ART FREEMAN It sounds like it scared your good. 

00:22:45
KARLA ROGERS Yeah, yeah. 

00:22:45
ART FREEMAN Wakeup says, time to get up, but throwing up blood says, ah…oh. 

00:22:50
KARLA ROGERS Yeah. 

00:22:55
ART FREEMAN Yeah. Again, given the time we have together Karla, you're talking about the low self-esteem, you're talking about relationship problems, you're talking about healing from the end of this relationship and you're talking about the eating. Which of those would you want to focus on in the time we have? 

00:23:20
KARLA ROGERS Probably the thing that’s most serious and most in my face right now would be like the eating disorder, because that's something that I have to control. 

00:23:30
ART FREEMAN Given the role related, that would be a piece that we can focus on. 

00:23:35
KARLA ROGERS Okay. 

00:23:35
ART FREEMAN Okay? 

00:23:35
KARLA ROGERS Okay. 

00:23:35
ART FREEMAN Would that be right with you? 

00:23:40
KARLA ROGERS That’s fine. 

00:23:40
ART FREEMAN Okay. Let me take out some information about what you do. You go two or three days without eating, what do you say to yourself as you do that? 

00:23:55
KARLA ROGERS You know, it's like you're getting… you know, getting dressed in the morning and you look at yourself in the mirror and you see this… you see this out of shape, fat, you think of like what everyone has told you since you're a little kid about your body, you know, you are fat or you are not the right, you know, you didn’t fit in. 

00:24:25
ART FREEMAN If I showed you a mirror as you were describing yourself. 

00:24:25
KARLA ROGERS Yeah. 

00:24:30
ART FREEMAN About looking at your body in the morning, what would you see? If I just show it to your face? 

00:24:35
KARLA ROGERS Just my face? 

00:24:35
ART FREEMAN When you talked about looking the mirror in the morning. 

00:24:40
KARLA ROGERS What would I see? I would know it… I would probably see this… I would see a little girl. I would see the… you know, the little girl who got teased. I'd see the… I'd see the teenager that, you know, never dated. 

00:25:10
ART FREEMAN Because of your weight? 

00:25:10
KARLA ROGERS Because of my appearance. Because of I… you know, I was unapproachable. 

00:25:15
ART FREEMAN Because of your appearance? 

00:25:20
KARLA ROGERS I… That’s what I have gained from it. 

00:25:20
ART FREEMAN Let… Let me understand, were you so, whatever you saw about your body was so unattractive that people would run away from you, people wouldn’t even approach you? 

00:25:35
KARLA ROGERS No. 

00:25:35
ART FREEMAN People would say, "oh god, I can't even look at her?" 

00:25:35
KARLA ROGERS I was teased a lot. I was… It was just a… 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:50
KARLA ROGERS It's not that they would like run from me or whatever, but I think that goes to how I push people away. If I was feeling so horrible, then I pushed other people away. 

00:26:00
ART FREEMAN So you kept a distance? 

00:26:00
KARLA ROGERS I kept the distance and somehow my view of what my appearance is an… being so angry with it or being whatever, I… I push people away. 

00:26:15
ART FREEMAN Okay! So what you learned from the teasing was, there's something wrong with me. 

00:26:20
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:26:20
ART FREEMAN I'm defective and may be from what you're saying also, I am unlovable? 

00:26:25
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:26:25
ART FREEMAN Is that part of it? I don't wanna put words in your mouth I… 

00:26:30
KARLA ROGERS Yeah, it sounds right. Good words, yeah, it'll be it. 

00:26:30
ART FREEMAN So, I'm unattractive, I'm unlovable. And one of the way to protect yourself was by being unapproachable, that you find reasons to keep people at a distance. And I don’t wanna get off on to the relationship, because we need to focus, my hunches then that, you allowed someone in… 

00:26:50
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:26:50
ART FREEMAN …despite your best thinking, I better keep people away and that didn’t work out? 

00:26:55
KARLA ROGERS Right. 

00:26:55
ART FREEMAN So, they have more evidence that wasn’t too good idea to begin with? 

00:27:00
KARLA ROGERS Since I was… I was cheated on about five times. 

00:27:05
ART FREEMAN Okay! So let me understand you… you're getting dressed in the morning and look in the mirror and say, "burr, look at that fat, disgusting, unlovable, unattractive thing?" 

00:27:20
KARLA ROGERS Umm… Yeah! 

00:27:20
ART FREEMAN Is that what you're saying? 

00:27:20
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:27:20
ART FREEMAN And then what do you say to yourself? 

00:27:25
KARLA ROGERS I have to fix those. I have to… In my idea fixing it is not eating that you know may be by just don’t eat so much. 

00:27:30
ART FREEMAN Okay. 

00:27:30
KARLA ROGERS You know, if I don’t eat so much today it gets very easy for me to not eat so much the next day. 

00:27:35
ART FREEMAN Okay, so that the sequence is, oh yuck, I better do something to fix it, so there is a… a real functional part of it. I want to take control and fix myself, okay. Aha… The way I'm gonna take control is by not eating today and do you… do you then plan to not eat for three days or is that the next morning you say I won't eat today either? 

00:28:00
KARLA ROGERS It's… I… It's like I start to get on a war, you know, it's just like I'm doing really well, instead of like doing something healthy like, if you are at the gym and you may be push a little bit more weight. 

00:28:10
ART FREEMAN Right! 

00:28:10
KARLA ROGERS I do something where it's just like, hey I got through the day and I didn’t eat, let's try this again, this is working. This is a good thing. 

00:28:15
ART FREEMAN So your goal is how can I take control of my life? That’s the goal? 

00:28:25
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:28:25
ART FREEMAN Because as I wrote that down just… so I don’t forget it, one of the things I wrote down is control. That’s a goal for you. How can I take control? And one of the ways you're gonna take control is by not eating, that’s the anorectic part. 

00:28:35
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:28:35
ART FREEMAN Okay! Again let me just understand the sequence, you go two to three days and yet you don’t eat. You don’t eat nothing? 

00:28:45
KARLA ROGERS Nothing. 

00:28:45
ART FREEMAN Water? 

00:28:45
KARLA ROGERS I… I drink cherry coke. 

00:28:45
ART FREEMAN Cherry coke! Diet cherry coke or… 

00:28:50
KARLA ROGERS Oh no, micro(ph) cherry coke. 

00:28:50
ART FREEMAN Yeah, if you drink… you drink, you want high test. 

00:28:55
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:28:55
ART FREEMAN You want the sugar and you want the caffeine, okay. So that’s all, what you drink is cherry coke. So now you have been drinking cherry coke for three days, then what happens? 

00:29:05
KARLA ROGERS Then it's just like I… I may get like headaches. It's starting to be something that’s noticed at work where it's like, "why don’t you join us for lunch?" "No, I don’t want to." "No!" "Why don’t you join us for lunch, kind of a deal and… 

00:29:25
ART FREEMAN You think they know the secret? 

00:29:25
KARLA ROGERS I think they have an idea, you know, the way, people have started to notice that I have lost a… like a lot of weight. I was like 180 pounds and I'm down to a 130 and this has been in a year. 

00:29:45
ART FREEMAN Big shift? 

00:29:45
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! And… And I think people… people notice… notice it and, you know. 

00:29:50
ART FREEMAN I'm… I'm confused, you want control, how did you get to 180? 

00:30:00
KARLA ROGERS That was when I was out of control. That’s… 

00:30:00
ART FREEMAN That you were out of control? 

00:30:00
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:30:00
ART FREEMAN So, what you are doing now is very functional, I want to take control. The way you're doing it is self injurious. Is… Is that the way you see? 

00:30:15
KARLA ROGERS That's the way I see it. 

00:30:15
ART FREEMAN I don’t want like a judgment, but that’s the way you see it. You'd love to have control, you'd love to not be this fat, disgusting thing you see yourself to be. Let me just again go off to the side so that I can understand a little bit more you Karla. If you weighed 78 pounds, do you think you'd be happier? You look in the mirror and say, ah that’s gorgeous! 

00:30:45
KARLA ROGERS I think, you know, at first… at first when you said I was, I thought, yeah. 

00:30:55
ART FREEMAN It’s in the face. 

00:31:00
KARLA ROGERS Yeah, I actually… 

00:31:00
ART FREEMAN Hey, that sounds neat! 

00:31:00
KARLA ROGERS That sounds pretty good. And then I… 

00:31:00
ART FREEMAN But there is another part that says what? 

00:31:05
KARLA ROGERS (inaudible ), no that would be bad, I look like a skeleton and I'd be killing myself. 

00:31:10
ART FREEMAN And your (crosstalk)(inaudible) and… 

00:31:10
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:31:15
ART FREEMAN …you affect your heart and all the rest of stuff and you're spiting out blood. 

00:31:15
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:31:15
ART FREEMAN Okay! So, you're gonna get the headaches and then what do you do? 

00:31:20
KARLA ROGERS I get the headaches and then it's just like, it becomes reward. It's like, well, may be if I eat just a little bit it'll be… you know, it's like… it’s kind like a reward. I'll treat myself to food instead of like somebody who treat themselves to chocolate cake or whatever, mine is just food. Like I go to the Thai restaurant, I go to the Chinese restaurant and you know, I'll eat and then, you know, I… I start to feel guilty or my stomach… 

00:31:50
ART FREEMAN Oh, oh, back up, you go and have a meal and then you feel guilty? 

00:31:55
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:31:55
ART FREEMAN What do you say to yourself that then ends up with you feeling guilty? What was going on here? 

00:32:00
KARLA ROGERS I shouldn’t have done that. 

00:32:05
ART FREEMAN I shouldn’t have done it. 

00:32:05
KARLA ROGERS I shouldn’t have done it. It's… It's like, you've lost control again, like you couldn’t have… you couldn’t have held out a little bit more, you didn’t really need this reward, you didn’t really need to eat this much and… 

00:32:20
ART FREEMAN Well, wait, if you just have a reasonable meal, you got to know have some wonton soup and, you know, some flavor. 

00:32:25
KARLA ROGERS Three days of not eating, you know, and appetizer and you know is to me is still a lot of food, it’s a lot of food. 

00:32:35
ART FREEMAN So it's not that you recognize here Karla, it’s not the massive food but a perception you have. 

00:32:40
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:32:40
ART FREEMAN So if you have an appetizer you say, "oh my God I'm pigging out." 

00:32:45
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:32:45
ART FREEMAN How do you resolve this? The part of you that convinces you to either starve or binge and then throw up and the part of it that says, "this is not, I'm making myself sick, I'm… I'm killing myself or in (inaudible ). How do you balance those two? 

00:33:10
KARLA ROGERS I guess I sort of hide in the rest of my life that’s going well and I kind of put this off like, well, I'll… I'll do it with that later. I… I don’t… When it becomes so out of control, I just don’t deal with it. 

00:33:25
ART FREEMAN You focus on something else? 

00:33:25
KARLA ROGERS I focus on something else (inaudible ) my cheery cokes. I mean, it still in the back, it's always with me, it’s always with me. But if it gets to the part where I'm just so upset and I'm just so, this is it, you know, I just can’t deal with this. Then I'll focus on something else. I'll focus on school. I'll focus on… 

00:33:40
ART FREEMAN Your work? 

00:33:40
KARLA ROGERS My work! 

00:33:45
ART FREEMAN So, what you're able to do is to distract yourself? 

00:33:50
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:33:50
ART FREEMAN If I am hearing you right, here Karla, there is an of a lot going on in your head about what you look like, what you feel like and how you need to act. So there are three pieces, your thoughts, your feelings and your behaviors. Which of those do you think, if you could take control, would be the best direction to go in first? How you're thinking, how you're feeling or how you're behaving. 

00:34:30
KARLA ROGERS I'd… I would have to say, the behavior just because it’s a life and it's… I am taking my life in my hands every time I don’t eat, you know, it’s some… it's an immediate thing that I need to control. 

00:34:45
ART FREEMAN Right! And you take your life in your hands when you binge and purge. 

00:34:50
KARLA ROGERS Right! If the thinking about it the… the regaining, I don’t know, self-esteem whatever you wanna call it, I think that’s gonna take, you know, such a long time, but understanding this behavior, like knowing when it's gonna happen, why it's happening. I need that control, I need that. 

00:35:10
ART FREEMAN That will be the first piece to work on. 

00:35:15
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:35:15
ART FREEMAN You've seen counselors, you've seen therapists before, you've talked about your eating disorder with them? 

00:35:25
KARLA ROGERS A little bit, but it was more a focus on my relationship that ended and… 

00:35:35
ART FREEMAN You mean, 12 years you haven’t talked to anyone about this eating problem? 

00:35:40
KARLA ROGERS I have but I didn’t make that big of a deal about it. 

00:35:40
ART FREEMAN You know it was a big deal? 

00:35:45
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! I was just like, you know, but sometimes I just don’t eat and they're like, "Hmm…hmm… Why is that? "Well, because I'm really unhappy with my relationship." And then they would go into the relationship, you know I am… I am… 

00:35:55
ART FREEMAN It was a good distraction? 

00:35:55
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! I'm pretty good at making those distractions for most people. 

00:36:00
ART FREEMAN On a scale of zero to ten, zero-forget about it not at all, ten-absolute total can't avoid it, how much do you wanna take control of your eating? 

00:36:15
[sil.] 

00:36:20
KARLA ROGERS I'd have to say like an eight or nine. 

00:36:25
ART FREEMAN An eight or nine! So, this is something you really wanna do? 

00:36:30
KARLA ROGERS It’s… It's gotten to that point, yeah. 

00:36:30
ART FREEMAN Okay! Would you like to start to do some things to help you get some control? 

00:36:40
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:36:40
ART FREEMAN Is that something you'd be willing to try to start, to begin to do? 

00:36:50
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:36:50
ART FREEMAN Okay! Let’s start with today. What today's been? Has today been an eating day, normal eating, a starving day or a binge and purge day? 

00:37:00
KARLA ROGERS Basically a starving… a starving day. 

00:37:05
ART FREEMAN Yesterday? 

00:37:10
KARLA ROGERS Yesterday it was, I looked in the mirror and I was just like burr. But I still ate, because I had to. 

00:37:20
ART FREEMAN Did you throw it up or that just? 

00:37:20
KARLA ROGERS No, I kept that down, it was pasta so I… I kept that down. But, you know, I'm sure in the next couple of days, I mean, it will get to a point where you take four or five laxatives or you take some ipecac and just… and it'll be gone and I'll feel better. 

00:37:40
ART FREEMAN One of the things that concerns me is when you call this thing it, because it almost makes it seem as if it's outside of you. You know, it's snowing out, now what can you do about that? 

00:38:00
KARLA ROGERS Right! 

00:38:00
ART FREEMAN It’s raining out. It… It sounds at times when you talk about it as if this eating problem is eternity. It… It just kind of happens. This is the morning, you look in the mirror and you say, "I've gotto do something about it, or it’s a bad day, it's an eating day, it’s a starving day, it's a? 

00:38:25
[sil.] 

00:38:30
KARLA ROGERS I guess because it's… because it's seems like something that I have to fight, that I… I'm coming face-to-face with, somehow I'm personifying this thing in my life that has control of me. 

00:38:50
ART FREEMAN Yet? 

00:38:50
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:38:50
ART FREEMAN Yeah! So what we need to work on is getting you started on taking control of it, that Karla is gonna do something about her eating, you are gonna do something about what you're doing. 

00:39:05
KARLA ROGERS Right! 

00:39:05
ART FREEMAN Okay! Have you ever thought of just keeping an eating log? Just keeping a log on a daily basis of what you eat or don’t eat? 

00:39:20
[sil.] 

00:39:25
KARLA ROGERS I have never no, I mean that sounds like such a simple thing that, you know, I could start with and I never really thought about that. 

00:39:35
ART FREEMAN Would you be willing to try that? 

00:39:35
KARLA ROGERS Yeah, I would. 

00:39:35
ART FREEMAN Let me explain why. One of the things we know, and there is no other research on this, when people start self-monitoring, start looking at themselves there is usually a change, even without trying to make a change, that is you start to look at yourself, there is often a change. So, one thing you might try is just getting a pad, little pad, something you keep in your pocket and for a one-week period, one week time, to keep track of everything that you eat or don’t eat. That if you have some water write it down, it's such and such a time and such and such a day, I had a glass of water, even if the water has no calories you're not gonna get fat from the water. Do you understand the goal of just doing that, just keeping track? 

00:40:40
KARLA ROGERS Because may be I'll see that I am not either eating that I'm… I'm not eating that much that, I'm keeping track of it, it's not getting out of control. 

00:40:50
ART FREEMAN Yeah, the key word is still control. This would be one way to start to take control, to start to keep an eating log of everything that, everything you… you put in your mouth. That includes laxatives that goes in your mouth, water, cherry coke, Chinese food, Thai food whatever, to keep track of it, to start of self-monitor. So that’s one piece of starting to get control. Because I think the good news is Karla that you've been trying to take control, but you are using ways that have not worked or have a real bad side effect, the starving and binging and purging, ways of taking control but they… they're not the best ways to do what you want to do, which is control your weight. 

00:41:40
KARLA ROGERS Right! 

00:41:45
ART FREEMAN Because they could kill you and then you don’t have to worry about the weight. 

00:41:50
KARLA ROGERS But see I never look at that. I… You know, I know that they could kill me, but you know, it's like when I went to the doctor, there is nothing wrong with you, oh you look healthy! You know. 

00:42:00
ART FREEMAN Did he look at yourself esophagus? 

00:42:00
KARLA ROGERS Hmm… hmm… 

00:42:00
ART FREEMAN Fine? 

00:42:00
KARLA ROGERS It was… It was red and… and that sort of thing. 

00:42:05
ART FREEMAN Did you… Did you tell them about? 

00:42:10
KARLA ROGERS I told him about it and, you know, I've had some medicines are kind of why in my… my throat and my… and my stomach, but you know, it's just like, oh it's fine. You know, it… It's like I got away with it. Yeah, it's like I got away with it. I kind of have this, I'm invincible feeling, it's like, you know, I can keep doing this, because I keep getting away with it and people say, you look so thin or you know. 

00:42:40
ART FREEMAN You're looking great? 

00:42:40
KARLA ROGERS You look great! You look so much better than… 

00:42:40
ART FREEMAN Your… Your doctor said, well your throat is bit red but… 

00:42:45
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:42:45
ART FREEMAN Okay! Keeping track is one thing. Let… Let's talk about some other ways you can take control. Keeping track of… of it, kind of make an eating log or an eating diary is one way. 

00:43:00
KARLA ROGERS Okay! 

00:43:00
ART FREEMAN What sort of planning do you do for your meals? 

00:43:05
KARLA ROGERS There is no planning, because of the schedule I keep it work. Lot of it is just, you know, stop and make down let's get a salad. Stop… I have a craving for something. I have a craving for a cheese cake, stop and get like a cheese cake on the way home, that sort of thing. I don’t prepare my meals at… at home. I may… May be like on the weekends I might cook up something, but most of the time it's… it's like fast food or things that I can pick up. 

00:43:40
ART FREEMAN One of the problems in us meeting for this single session, there are things that would be good to do in sequence. And I don’t wanna overload you with lots of things now, because you'll walk out saying, oh my god, I have got to a 150 different things. So, there are things of… the ways of taking control, that’s going to be important, and one of the ways is going to be keeping eating log to start with. I'm gonna add one more piece, and that’s to think about, but don’t start it right now, to think about starting to plan your meals. That right now you're governed by it. It is, I wanna a piece of cheese cake and there is another piece that’s says and I gotto have it, right? Or, you know, I'd like to eat a whole chocolate cake and I have a chocolate. And you say, well that’s unreasonable but a part of you says, you know it's not so unreasonable you can have a whole cake. So, planning is another way of taking control. Okay? 

00:44:50
KARLA ROGERS Okay! 

00:44:50
ART FREEMAN Can you think of any other planning you can do as a way of taking control? 

00:45:00
KARLA ROGERS You know, I do much better with like, time, like timeframes, like may be planning up, take out time of the day to eat and anyway it's sticking my… sticking to that, because you know, I could… I can always say right now, well, I can’t… I can't eat right now, because I'm doing this or I'm too busy now, but if I eat at a particular… if I say, I have to eat at four, no matter what or if I have to eat at, you know, whatever time, may be, you know, something like that when I'm on like some sort of schedule, something like that. 

00:45:35
ART FREEMAN So that’s not the possibility? 

00:45:35
KARLA ROGERS Something like that. 

00:45:35
ART FREEMAN Now, you are a teacher, if I remember my teaching stuff, you have to make out lesson plans, the being of a teacher's existence? 

00:45:50
KARLA ROGERS Yeah, you are supposed to. 

00:45:50
ART FREEMAN And every once in a while they check them? 

00:45:50
KARLA ROGERS Hmm…hmm… 

00:45:55
ART FREEMAN Just in the case you're absent one day, someone else can do what’s you do. 

00:45:55
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:45:55
ART FREEMAN Do you make out lesson plans? 

00:46:00
KARLA ROGERS Not as frequently as I… as I should, but, yeah, I pretty much stick to them. 

00:46:05
ART FREEMAN What’s the purpose of the lesson plan? 

00:46:10
KARLA ROGERS Kind of like an over, like an over… overlooking like the chapters that you're gonna study, overlooking the artists that you… you're gonna study so that you can look ahead, like what am I… you know, this is what we're doing this week and next week I'll start this. 

00:46:30
ART FREEMAN Gives you a sequence through the term? 

00:46:30
KARLA ROGERS Yeah, like a sequence. 

00:46:30
ART FREEMAN What do you think would happen Karla if you applied that same technique to your life, doing lesson planning for life, thinking what am I gonna do this week and next week and the week after? 

00:46:50
KARLA ROGERS I can't look that far ahead. 

00:46:50
ART FREEMAN Okay! Alright! There is another piece. Was this okay that you start on some of the behaviors, see if we can control some of that. There are the two pieces we talked about with the thoughts and the feelings. Which of those would be the second in line to work on? 

00:47:15
KARLA ROGERS Probably the feelings. Yeah, probably the feelings, like why am I feeling this way am I, yeah. 

00:47:25
ART FREEMAN That sounds like a thought though. 

00:47:30
KARLA ROGERS It sounds like a thought, but… Somehow I… I… I feel those are… Somehow I… the kind of connected to me they're the same thing. I mean… 

00:47:45
ART FREEMAN It's often hard to tease apart thoughts and feelings. So if you say, I feel sad, that’s kind of clearly a feeling. If you say, I feel as if I'll never take control of my life, that’s much more of a thought. 

00:48:00
KARLA ROGERS And then… Yeah! I still say that the… the… the feelings, the… 

00:48:05
ART FREEMAN What is the primary feeling that causes you the most difficulty? 

00:48:15
[sil.] 

00:48:25
KARLA ROGERS Just like being alone, vulnerable. 

00:48:35
ART FREEMAN So, if you say to yourself, I'm alone and therefore vulnerable, how does that make you feel? 

00:48:45
KARLA ROGERS Like out of control. 

00:48:45
ART FREEMAN There is that control word again. 

00:48:50
KARLA ROGERS There is that control word, yeah. 

00:48:50
ART FREEMAN So being alone and vulnerable, you end up feeling out of control and when you talk about that, how do you end up, right now feeling, just even talking about it? 

00:49:05
KARLA ROGERS Well… I guess because, you know, it’s like I felt that today, I felt that yesterday. It’s… It's like why am I at the surface? 

00:49:15
ART FREEMAN Right this second? 

00:49:20
KARLA ROGERS Thanks, I wasn't gonna use those. I was pretty, really good. 

00:49:25
[sil.] 

00:49:30
KARLA ROGERS Like I'm be in observed, like I'm being watched, like somebody knows that I'm not in control. See it’s like, right now I just lost control in front of you. 

00:49:45
ART FREEMAN Because you're crying? 

00:49:45
KARLA ROGERS Because I'm crying. 

00:49:45
ART FREEMAN What does that mean that I see you crying? 

00:49:50
KARLA ROGERS That this person who's usually in control, who can, you know, who can do always other things. 

00:50:00
ART FREEMAN It looks real good, to put on a good façade and distract us. 

00:50:05
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:50:05
ART FREEMAN No not just… Let's say ask me the doctor. 

00:50:05
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:50:10
ART FREEMAN And then the façade breaks and I can see how sad, upset and scared you are. And that’s not something you want to show, okay. 

00:50:20
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! That’s not… That's not something in that… I'm supposed to show, because you lose control then, you know, people approach you, people make a judgment about you. 

00:50:35
ART FREEMAN Using this example right here Karla, I've seen you cry, lose control. What do you think I think about you? 

00:50:50
KARLA ROGERS Why is that she's got like a lot of problems? 

00:51:00
ART FREEMAN If I said to myself you have a lot of problems I wouldn’t be a (inaudible ) therapist, but you ever told me that. 

00:51:02
KARLA ROGERS Oh, yeah! 

00:51:05
ART FREEMAN The first thing is second. You told me that. 

00:51:10
KARLA ROGERS That you know, I'm… I'm vulnerable, I'm not strong enough, you know. I mean, she's crying over, falling up, she's crying over being alone or vulnerable. 

00:51:20
ART FREEMAN Yeah! You're not quite… Yeah, that's the thing, you… you started crying when you said, feeling alone and vulnerable. And what it makes you feel is sad and scared, those were the big pieces. So that it's gonna be important to look at these three pieces. What you are thinking, what you are feeling, and what you are doing. And that kind of gives you something of a lesson plan for future therapy work. 

00:51:50
KARLA ROGERS Hmm…hmm… 

00:51:55
ART FREEMAN How are you feeling right now? 

00:52:00
KARLA ROGERS It's still like a loss of… it’s a loss of… it’s like a loss of control. You know, it's like I'm crying and I can't stop. It's… My nose is running and, you know, it's… it's like I'm felling like the little kid again. I'm feeling like a… a little kid who can't control her emotions. 

00:52:25
ART FREEMAN Yeah! And what does that mean to you? If that were true, what does that mean? I mean, a little kid who can't control her emotions, what does that mean? 

00:52:35
KARLA ROGERS Somehow, usually I was reprimanded for that. You know, you don’t… you don't show your emotions could be in a big baby, no we're just teasing you. 

00:52:45
ART FREEMAN And who said that? 

00:52:50
KARLA ROGERS Parents-mainly, people that I knew, not friends but, you know, other classmates. 

00:52:55
ART FREEMAN So one of the pieces you learned was how I can hide, what I'm feeling. You hide what you're doing. You hide what you're thinking and every once in a while that breaks through as it did just here. Do you think I've lost respect for you, that’s why you cried? 

00:53:20
KARLA ROGERS You don’t know anything about me to respect me in the first place. 

00:53:25
ART FREEMAN That’s right! Do you think I think there's something wrong with you that you cried? 

00:53:30
KARLA ROGERS Somehow I feel there is something wrong or else it wouldn’t be, you know, I don’t know. 

00:53:35
ART FREEMAN But I'm asking a different question Karla. Do you think the crying makes you more defective? Is there something wrong if someone cries? 

00:53:50
[sil.] 

00:53:55
KARLA ROGERS I don’t think it's something… I think it's like you said for the real important things and right now I don’t, you know, it’s just like. 

00:54:05
ART FREEMAN This would big important thing. Being alone and vulnerable is scary, that’s a big important thing and I think something that in addition to the eating you gonna have to work on, because they are related. 

00:54:25
[sil.] 

00:54:30
ART FREEMAN But there that be dealt with separately, felling alone and vulnerable. 

00:54:40
KARLA ROGERS It's… The eating… The eating is something that’s so, in my face, it's so, you know, it’s… it's so immediate. I mean, your stomach growls. It's, you know, it's that eating thing. 

00:54:55
ART FREEMAN Right! 

00:54:55
KARLA ROGERS Alone and vulnerable, you… you hide yourself and you work, you put on a happy face, you have on too many drinks on a bar, you… you know, you hide it and… 

00:55:10
ART FREEMAN Until it comes and bites you on the ankle? 

00:55:15
KARLA ROGERS The ankle, yeah. 

00:55:20
ART FREEMAN We have about five minutes left. 

00:55:20
KARLA ROGERS Okay! 

00:55:20
ART FREEMAN And I'd like to kind of tie some things up, if we can in the last five minutes. 

00:55:25
KARLA ROGERS Okay! 

00:55:30
ART FREEMAN One of the things that I'd like you to do is tell me what you're gonna take home with you today? Given the time we've had, what did you learn today with anything? What are you gonna take home with you? 

00:55:50
KARLA ROGERS That the first step like keeping check what I eat. That my first step isn’t quite as big, it's like a baby step. I thought kind of because it's something that consumed me so much, that the first step would be something like, why to change your entire… all your habits change everything. 

00:56:10
ART FREEMAN Change your life? 

00:56:15
KARLA ROGERS Change your life, you know. 

00:56:15
ART FREEMAN Within 45 minutes you think you're gonna change your whole life? 

00:56:15
KARLA ROGERS Well, I'll change my life. You're… You're that good, so… so you know I… that it’s… that it's a… it’s something that I can come to terms with. 

00:56:30
ART FREEMAN It’s something you can start? 

00:56:30
KARLA ROGERS It’s something I can start. 

00:56:35
ART FREEMAN Okay! What else you'll take home with you? 

00:56:40
KARLA ROGERS That’s there is a lot more to all of… all of this. That there is a lot of things that are just so… it's like a spiral. It's… It's like, you're gonna come face-to-face with… with it somewhere in this whole big path. 

00:57:00
ART FREEMAN Yeah! 

00:57:00
KARLA ROGERS You know, you're gonna see it again. 

00:57:00
ART FREEMAN Yeah! 

00:57:00
KARLA ROGERS You're gonna see it again. 

00:57:00
ART FREEMAN As you start to go up you're gonna see the same things again and again at different levels, you're right. So that’s a good insight. Anything else you're taking home with you? 

00:57:15
[sil.] 

00:57:20
KARLA ROGERS May be feeling a little bit better that, you know, I… I looked at this. You know, I didn’t just go home and… I mean, I'm not gonna say that I'm not going to but that my… may be my first thought isn't gonna be go home and (inaudible ). 

00:57:40
ART FREEMAN Yeah1 Let me share my reaction. I think you show an incredible amount of courage for being willing to do this, you could have just as easily come and said, I wanna talk about my ex-boyfriend. 

00:57:55
KARLA ROGERS Hmm…hmm… Yeah! 

00:58:00
ART FREEMAN And we go spend our time talking about the relationship. 

00:58:00
KARLA ROGERS I've spent too much time on that anyway, but go ahead. 

00:58:05
ART FREEMAN And not talked about this which is a much more serious issue, so that shows a lot of courage. And I think that’s a good prognostic sign. That’s good news. I'd like to get some feedback? Did I say anything that, you found hurtful, harmful? 

00:58:30
[sil.] 

00:58:35
KARLA ROGERS No! Usually the… the therapists, counselors that I've… that I've seen are more, it's like it was a breakthrough when you cry. You know, it's like, oh my God you're crying like a baby and (inaudible ) on the table and I got to use it today. You know, it's… it was like, it was a good thing to lose that control and like they wanted that and you sit back and you… you know, it didn’t matter you if I cried or not or… you just wanted some information, you wanted to know some things. 

00:59:10
ART FREEMAN Does that mean it make… make me a cold, unfeeling cared that I didn’t care that you're crying? 

00:59:15
KARLA ROGERS No, it… it… it makes you a, not quite, you wanna threat to me. You know, it wasn’t… You weren't a threat to me. And yeah, I wasn’t too happy that I cried or anything, because, I mean you are a stranger but you weren’t a threat, you weren’t like pushing me, pushing me to cry, you know or… 

00:59:45
ART FREEMAN That means all my therapist tricks to say, how can I make her cry. Tell me all about the things that upset you? 

00:59:50
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:59:50
ART FREEMAN And let's see if we can get you crying, because you'll feel better afterwards? 

00:59:50
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

00:59:50
ART FREEMAN And the point of fact that's interesting, you don’t feel better afterwards. 

00:59:55
KARLA ROGERS Oh no! 

00:59:55
ART FREEMAN You feel worse! Getting all that emotion out, for some people it might be helpful, for you it’s an indication of being out of control and you hate that. So, one of the things I'd like you to take home in big block letters is, finding ways to begin to assert control in a healthier way. Does that make sense to you? 

01:00:20
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

01:00:20
ART FREEMAN Okay! 

01:00:20
KARLA ROGERS Pretty much so. 

01:00:25
ART FREEMAN Time is up Karla, any last things before we end? 

01:00:30
KARLA ROGERS No! I… I've… Well, yeah. I avoid and spend like my best, why are you dealing with this and? 

01:00:40
ART FREEMAN It’s… It's a way of getting control and getting out of here. 

01:00:45
KARLA ROGERS And you know, you… you tell a joke, you do whatever and… and it's not… you… you can get away with it and in 45 minutes I didn’t get away with it, you know, I'd… I… 

01:01:00
ART FREEMAN Kind of held you? 

01:01:00
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

01:01:00
ART FREEMAN Okay! 

01:01:00
KARLA ROGERS But now I have to look at it. 

01:01:00
ART FREEMAN Got to look at it? 

01:01:05
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

01:01:05
ART FREEMAN Karla wish you luck to get it. 

01:01:05
KARLA ROGERS Thank you. 

01:01:10
ART FREEMAN Thanks for doing this. 

01:01:10
KARLA ROGERS You're welcome. 

01:01:15
[sil.] 

01:01:20
ART FREEMAN What I want to do very early in this session is to once again tell her we have 45 minutes and to get from her an idea of what she'd like to accomplish in the limited time that we have. 

01:01:35
JON CARLSON So this is what is meant as structuring the interview. 

01:01:40
ART FREEMAN This is the beginning of the structure, yeah. We've got 45 minutes. May be a good place for us to begin Karla is why you're here and what you'd like to do I get out of the time we have? 

01:01:55
KARLA ROGERS In 45 minutes? 

01:01:55
ART FREEMAN At least we can start to make a list. 

01:02:00
KARLA ROGERS Okay! Well, had to do list. I recently sort of gained control of my life. I've started my career as an art teacher. Starting to get back on my feet after a relationship that dissolved and there is still like a few issues, a few things that I think I need to deal with, come face-to-face with so that this process keeps moving forward instead of holding me back. 

01:02:40
ART FREEMAN What are some of the problems? Getting control of your life, that sounds great. Recovering from a relationship, that’s in the plus column. What are the kinds of things that you want to get face-to-face with? 

01:02:55
KARLA ROGERS The… I'm… I'm sure it started but before that but the relationship kind of left me with quite a low self-esteem to the point where I would say it contributed a great deal to an eating disorder. 

01:03:20
ART FREEMAN The eating disorder being what? 

01:03:20
KARLA ROGERS Well, I'm… I'm multitalented that way. Yeah, I'm anorexic, bulimic, just kind of both and it depends… depends on the day. 

01:03:35
ART FREEMAN Some days you won’t eat at all and… 

01:03:40
KARLA ROGERS Basically what I'll do is, I won’t eat for like two or three days and then I'll reward myself for doing such a great job of not eating for two or three days and then I'll go and just peg out, you know, I'll throw it up or whatever. So then… 

01:04:00
ART FREEMAN What’s whatever? 

01:04:05
KARLA ROGERS Laxatives, whatever and this has been going on, you know, for a… for a while and it's getting to the point where a lot more people notice it. I used to be really good at it and you know people would say, oh you look so thin, you look so nice and healthy, and that's just like, I mean, I was killing myself and… 

01:04:30
ART FREEMAN So one piece that we can talk about is getting control of the eating problems. 

01:04:35
KARLA Yeah! 

01:04:35
ART FREEMAN Another piece you're talking about and related to the eating problems is getting control of how you feel about yourself? 

01:04:40
KARLA Yeah! 

01:04:45
ART FREEMAN What else is on that list Karla? While we hear our couple of great leads, relationship problems, low self-esteem is always good, you can jump after that pretty quickly, but the eating disorder, that I think is really important, because what we know about people with eating disorders is control is a major issue. So control twice in a minute and a half, the first minute and a half, and then… and eating disorder shortly after that, that there seems to be a theme emerging. I'm going to try to encourage her to see how that theme does play itself out. 

01:05:20
DIANE KJOS So you've already started building a hypothesis here, yeah. 

01:05:20
ART FREEMAN Control is an issue and it may be manifested in the eating problem. So the eating stuff started when you were about 15, you are now 27, so it’s been going on for 12 years? 

01:05:35
KARLA ROGERS It's been going on for 12 years and then this past year I had a… I went to the doctors because it got to the point where my body was just starting to just give up, you know, and it was a kind of wakeup call. So… 

01:05:55
ART FREEMAN I bet it was. 

01:05:55
KARLA ROGERS Yeah, yeah! Throw up blood in that pizza and it’s kind of a… a wakeup call. 

01:06:05
ART FREEMAN It sounds like more than a wakeup call. 

01:06:05
KARLA ROGERS Yeah1 

01:06:05
ART FREEMAN It sounds like it scared your good? 

01:06:10
KARLA ROGERS Oh yeah, yeah! 

01:06:10
ART FREEMAN Wakeup says time to get up, throwing up blood says ah…oh… 

01:06:15
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

01:06:20
ART FREEMAN Yeah! Again given the time we have together Karla, you're talking about the low self-esteem, you're talking about relationship problems, you're talking about healing from the end of this relationship and you're talking about the eating. Which of those would you want to focus on in the time we have? 

01:06:45
KARLA ROGERS Probably the thing that’s most serious and most in my face right now would be like the eating disorder, because that's something that I have to control. 

01:06:55
ART FREEMAN Given the role related that would be a piece that we can focus on. 

01:07:00
KARLA ROGERS Okay! 

01:07:00
ART FREEMAN Okay? Would that be right with you? 

01:07:05
KARLA ROGERS That’s fine. 

01:07:05
ART FREEMAN Okay! Once again, she's vague and I think there are two things happening here, Diane, Jon. I think one of the things happening is she's vague with me, because it's still something she's hesitant to disclose. Second, I think she may be vague with herself that she really hasn't self-monitored the extent of this difficulty that has been going on since I'm a teenager, that could mean 13, that could mean… 

01:07:35
DIANE KJOS 19! 

01:07:35
ART FREEMAN …19! 

01:07:35
DIANE KJOS You know one of the things is that she put out this… this self-esteem, relationship problems and she put it out with the sort of squeaky voice and you go back to the eating disorder. How come you didn't stick with the other stuff? 

01:07:50
ART FREEMAN If she has an eating disorder, that could kill her. Self-esteem is an annoyance. Relationships can be a pain. Eating disorders can kill you. 

01:08:00
DIANE KJOS Okay, thank you. 

01:08:00
JON CARLSON If Karla Rogers were here, he would roll over. It wasn’t very reflective or empathic, you said, it's your, you know… 

01:08:10
ART FREEMAN I bet it is. 

01:08:10
JON CARLSON Yeah! 

01:08:15
ART FREEMAN Well, I think… 

01:08:15
JON CARLSON What were you doing? 

01:08:15
ART FREEMAN I want to let her know that I am being empathic. She is telling me that her body is giving up. She is real concerned and I want to let her know I bet this is serious and I think Karla would be very accepting. 

01:08:30
DIANE KJOS I think you wouldn’t mind that! 

01:08:35
JON CARLSON So that it's a real problem and you really need to emphasize this severity of this, so she's no longer in denial. 

01:08:40
ART FREEMAN Yeah, I… I'm not saying, let me grab you by the repulse and shake you and scream in your ear, but I am saying, there is a problem and I say, yeah I bet it is, because I have no question that it is. 

01:08:50
JON CARLSON It sounds like she is minimizing things with her smile and yet her words and this information goes against that. 

01:09:00
ART FREEMAN Yeah! It will be very easy to go with that pleasant smile, that kind of easygoing view and I'm… I'm not gonna buy that. I think this is too serious of a problem. 

01:09:10
JON CARLSON This is where you're allowing her to chose the problem that she wants to work on, helping to structure the interview. 

01:09:20
ART FREEMAN Right! Not… Not fully, because given that I've already said, this is more than a wakeup call, this is serious, that she said, "My body is giving up on me." That if she says, "Well, I really wanna talk about a problem I'm having at work." I might say, "Is that more important than the eating problem?" 

01:09:40
DIANE KJOS So you're gotto come back to that eating problem? 

01:09:45
ART FREEMAN Yeah! I think that's gonna be essential piece for us to focus on by her choice, so if she chooses self-esteem, I think that would be an interesting choice, but is it reasonable for 45 minutes and is it as life threatening once again? 

01:10:00
KARLA ROGERS I was teased a lot. I was… It was just a… It's not that they would like run from me or whatever, but I think that goes too how I push people away. If I was always feeling so horrible then I pushed other people away. 

01:10:25
ART FREEMAN So you kept a distance? 

01:10:25
KARLA ROGERS I kept the distance and somehow my view of what my appearance is an… being so angry with it or being whatever, I… I push people away. 

01:10:40
ART FREEMAN Okay! So, what you learned from the teasing was, there is something wrong with me. 

01:10:40
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

01:10:45
ART FREEMAN I'm defective and may be from what you're saying also I'm unlovable? 

01:10:50
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

01:10:50
ART FREEMAN Is that part of it? I mean, I don't wanna put words in your mouth I… 

01:10:55
KARLA ROGERS Well, it sounds right. Good words, that will be it. 

01:10:55
ART FREEMAN So I'm unattractive, I'm unlovable and one of the ways to protect yourself was by being unapproachable, that you find reasons to keep people at a distance. 

01:11:05
KARLA ROGERS Hmm…hmm… 

01:11:10
ART FREEMAN What I'm doing here is trying to identify some of the basic schema that she had really unhappy childhood experiences, but it's not simply the experience that I'm concerned with but really the learning, the… the ideas, the beliefs… 

01:11:30
DIANE KJOS That came out of that! 

01:11:30
ART FREEMAN …that came out of that, that I'm unlovable, I'm unattractive, I'm unlikable, I'm defective. As these are operative in her adult life, it causes her a great pain and great… great difficulties. 

01:11:45
JON CARLSON These are faulty beliefs that you want to challenge at some point in time? 

01:11:50
ART FREEMAN These are maladaptive beliefs, I wouldn’t call them faulty, because if one says, I'm defective, let me do something about it, defectiveness or view of defect becomes a… a pivot point and a beginning of change. If one says, I'm defective and therefore should hide from the world, it becomes the pivot point and an impetus to… to disappear and avoid the world. So I… I call them maladaptive rather than faulty. And then what do you say to yourself? 

01:12:20
KARLA ROGERS I've to fix this. I have to… And my idea of fixing it is not eating that, you know, may be if I just don’t eat so much. 

01:12:30
ART FREEMAN Okay! 

01:12:30
KARLA ROGERS You know, if I don’t eat so much today it gets very easy for me to not eat so much the next day. 

01:12:35
ART FREEMAN Okay, so that the sequence is, oh yuck, I better do something to fix it, so there is a… a real functional part of it. 

01:12:40
KARLA ROGERS Hmm…hmm… 

01:12:40
ART FREEMAN I wanna take control and fix myself, okay. Aha… The way I'm gonna take control is by not eating today. And do you… do you then plan to not eat for three days or is that the next morning you say, I won't eat today either? 

01:12:55
KARLA ROGERS It's… I… It's like I start to get on a war, you know, it's just like I'm doing really well, instead of like doing something healthy like, if you are at the gym and you may be push a little bit more weight. 

01:13:05
ART FREEMAN Right! 

01:13:05
KARLA ROGERS I do something where it's just like, hey I got through the day and I didn’t eat, let's try this again, this is working. This is a good thing. 

01:13:15
ART FREEMAN So your goal is how can I take control of my life, that’s the goal? 

01:13:20
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

01:13:20
DIANE KJOS There you go through that sequence and you bring up to functional part of what she's doing? 

01:13:30
ART FREEMAN Yeah! I think for most people, what they do has survival value. What they're trying to do is do their don’t just to survive. Despite their experiences as children as adolescence she's trying to do the best she can. The issue is not what she's doing but I think how she's doing it. To say, you know, it would be good if she lost weight, it would be good if she was within the parameters set by whatever chart in the doctor's reading. It's a good idea. The way she's choosing to go about it, is not a good idea. So, part of it want to is normalize it, say you know you're not crazy, you're doing something functional, try to maintain your weight. The way you're going about it is what we're gonna talk about. That’s life threatening. 

01:14:20
KARLA ROGERS I… I drink cherry coke. 

01:14:25
ART FREEMAN Cherry coke? Diet cherry coke or? 

01:14:25
KARLA ROGERS Oh no, micro(ph) cherry coke. 

01:14:30
ART FREEMAN Yeah, if you drink… you drink, you want high test. 

01:14:30
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

01:14:30
ART FREEMAN You want the sugar and you want the caffeine, okay. So, that’s what you drink is cherry coke. So now you've been drinking cherry coke for three days then what happens? 

01:14:40
KARLA ROGERS Then it's just like I… I may get like headaches. It's starting to be something that’s noticed at work, where it's like, "Why don’t you join us for lunch?" "No, I don’t want to. No!" "Why don’t you join us for lunch," kind of a deal and it becomes… 

01:15:00
ART FREEMAN You think they know the secret? 

01:15:05
KARLA ROGERS I think they have an idea. You know, the way people have started to notice that I've lost a… like a lot of weight. I was like 180 pounds and I'm down to about a 130 and this has been in a year. 

01:15:20
ART FREEMAN Big shift! 

01:15:20
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

01:15:25
JON CARLSON Seems like this is the point that you call this the secret. 

01:15:25
DIANE KJOS The secret! 

01:15:25
ART FREEMAN Yes! Very often, again from my experience in working with individuals with eating disorders, it's often a secret, but it's not just a secret from others, it's often a secret from themselves that they deny they have any eating problem. It's just that, I am dieting. I wanna make it explicit and I also wanna convey it to her a sense of my comfort. Once kind of taking the risk, I am saying, do they know your secret and she can say, well it's not a secret, everybody knows it. I talk about it all the time. Fine, I'll back go from that. But by saying to her, do they know your secret, in a very matter of fact way it conveys that I know about eating disorders, I work with people with this problem before, I know their nature of it, I know the… the secrecy that’s often part of it and that makes little easy for her to discuss it. 

01:16:30
DIANE KJOS This is somebody who'll understand? 

01:16:30
ART FREEMAN This guy understands something about the nature of eating problems. 

01:16:35
DIANE KJOS Okay! 

01:16:35
ART FREEMAN So, what we need to work on is getting you started on taking control of it, that Karla is gonna do something about her eating. You're gonna do something about what you're doing. Okay! Have you ever thought of just keeping an eating log? Just keeping a log on a daily basis of what you eat or don't eat? 

01:17:05
[sil.] 

01:17:10
KARLA ROGERS I have never, no. I mean, that sounds like such a simple thing that, you know, I could start with and I never really thought about that. 

01:17:20
ART FREEMAN Would you be willing to try that? 

01:17:20
KARLA ROGERS Yeah, I would. 

01:17:20
ART FREEMAN Let me explain why. One of the things we know, and there is no other research on this, when people start self-monitoring, start looking at themselves, there is usually a change, even without trying to make a change. That is you start to look at yourself, there is often a change. So, one thing you might try is just getting a pad, a little pad, something you can keep in your pocket and for a one-week period, one week time, to keep track of everything that you eat or don’t eat. That if you have some water-write it down. It's such and such a time and such and such a day, I had a glass of water, even if the water has no calories, you're not gonna get fat from the water. Do you understand the goal of just doing that, just keeping track? 

01:18:25
KARLA ROGERS Yes, maybe I'll see that, I'm not either eating that I'm… I'm not eating that much that… I'm keeping track of it. It's not getting out of control. 

01:18:35
DIANE KJOS There… There you began with an intervention that and… and you talked about trying to find something very simple this is. 

01:18:40
ART FREEMAN Right! This is simple. It's homework, that's something she's going to be doing outside the session and the way I conceptualize it is that the session is the lecture part of the course, the homework is the laboratory part. She's gonna gather data outside the session and that then becomes grease for the therapeutic mill within the therapy. So keeping an eating log has several advantages. It's simple, it's obvious, it assists her in self-monitoring and it will likely have a therapeutic effect without her doing anything to change and that was the point that I put out to her. 

01:19:25
JON CARLSON The purpose in making a suggestion was to, help to influence the results of this particular exercise? 

01:19:35
ART FREEMAN Yeah! I want to explain to her why and get it moving rather quickly. And I think it's important too that I don’t just take the homework and append it to the end of the session, oh our time is up, why don’t you try doing this. 

01:19:50
DIANE KJOS Yeah, yeah! 

01:19:50
ART FREEMAN One of the things that makes the homework important is that it grows organically from the content of this session. 

01:20:00
JON CARLSON So you tailor it to the particular situation. 

01:20:00
ART FREEMAN It is tailored, yeah! 

01:20:00
JON CARLSON But is the information important that you're giving her or the suggestion that this works? 

01:20:05
ART FREEMAN Both! That we know that there is an effect. Now, she may come back and say, I did this and there was no effect whatsoever, okay. This… This is true for many people. I'm also not gonna give her the references, because it’s… it's irrelevant, you know, here… here are the studies that shows. 

01:20:25
DIANE KJOS The research materials, yes! 

01:20:25
ART FREEMAN But to say this often works. I want her to start doing something. I want to educate her to the idea that therapy is not simply coming in an hour a week and basking in my aura. 

01:20:40
DIANE KJOS What if she said, look this is… is a such a simple suggestion to me. What if she had said, oh I've tried that? What would you do then? 

01:20:50
ART FREEMAN Okay! If she had tried it and it hadn’t had any effect, I'd want to explore what she has tried and what worked and what didn’t work and we may modify it. So for example, if she said, well, I tried it, my therapist, previous therapist said to try it for a week and I did it for one or two days and then, I stopped doing it. I'd then tell her that, have you done it for two days, would you be willing to try doing it for three days? Kind of backing down so that she gets success rather than just doing it. I wanted to get a sense of success that therapy is working. If she says, well, I've already tried it and it didn’t work. I wanna find out what didn’t work. This is akin to patients who often come in and say, I've… I've read every self-help book ever written. And when you explore, what they'll tell you is they've read the first two chapters of every self-help book ever written. And if they got to the seventh chapter, they might have learned something and they often don’t. Because they say, well, I've tried it, it didn’t work. I'd explore further. 

01:21:55
DIANE KJOS Okay! 

01:21:55
ART FREEMAN Can you think of any other planning you can do as a way of taking control? 

01:22:05
KARLA ROGERS You know I do much better with like time, like timeframes, like may be planning on a particular time of the day to eat and anyway sticking to my… sticking to that, because you know, I could… I can only say right now, well, I can’t… I can't eat right now, because I'm doing this or I'm too busy now. But if I eat at a particular… If I say, I have to eat at four no matter what or if I have to eat at, you know, whatever time, may be, you know, something like that where I'm on like some sort of schedule, something like that. 

01:22:35
ART FREEMAN So that’s not the possibility? 

01:22:40
KARLA ROGERS Something like that. 

01:22:40
ART FREEMAN Now, you are a teacher. If I remember my teaching stuff, you have to make out lesson plans, the being of a teacher's existence. 

01:22:50
KARLA ROGERS Yeah, you're supposed to. 

01:22:55
ART FREEMAN And every once in a while they check them? 

01:22:55
KARLA ROGERS Hmm…hmm… 

01:22:55
ART FREEMAN Just in the case you're absent one day, someone else can do what you do? 

01:23:00
KARLA ROGERS Yeah! 

01:23:00
ART FREEMAN Do you make out lesson plans? 

01:23:00
KARLA ROGERS Not as frequently as I… as I should, but yeah. I pretty much stick to them. 

01:23:10
ART FREEMAN She can't look that ahead and I'm not gonna push. For me to say, well, you've gotto look ahead, I'm a looser. She's working with me now. I've planted a seed. 

01:23:20
DIANE KJOS Yeah, yeah! 

01:23:20
JON CARLSON Another deceptively simple procedure that she says that, not only can I do this, but I'll stick to it once I do it. 

01:23:30
ART FREEMAN Yeah! 

01:23:30
JON CARLSON And you could see her really working on this too. 

01:23:35
ART FREEMAN I'm not gonna push it, because I wanna get through resistance. 

01:23:35
JON CARLSON You don’t need to. 

01:23:40
ART FREEMAN Right! 

01:23:40
JON CARLSON It doesn’t look like at all, like you've really tailored this very close to something that she can wear. It's gonna fit nice to her. 

01:23:45
ART FREEMAN Yeah, I… I think part of what we wanna to do, if she wouldn’t have counted, we talk about looking at the bottom line. 

01:23:50
JON CARLSON Oh sure! 

01:23:55
ART FREEMAN No, we were getting… 

01:23:55
JON CARLSON Yeah, that's clever. 

01:23:55
ART FREEMAN So we need to make it something that she understands. Lesson plans, she knows what they are, she may not do them all the time but she knows what they are, the purpose, the intent, the value. 

01:24:10
JON CARLSON And I stick to them! 

01:24:10
ART FREEMAN Right! Once I do. There's another piece. Was this okay, if you start on some of the behaviors to see if we can control some of that? There are the two pieces we talked about with the thoughts and the feelings. Which of those would be the second in line to work on? 

01:24:35
KARLA ROGERS Probably the feelings. You know, probably the feelings, like why am I feeling this, why am I, yeah. 

01:24:45
JON CARLSON Is it necessary her to work on thinking, feeling and acting in each session? 

01:24:55
ART FREEMAN No, it’s not necessary, I think it’s useful. There may be a session when you spend the whole time just working on behavior. There may be a session when you spend the whole time just working on feelings. There may be a session just thinking. We have time. We've done some behavioral work. We've talked about doing something. We've come up with homework and we've gotten some closure on this piece. We have got session time, we have got another 50 minutes or so in the session. I think there's enough time for us to open up to feelings. 

01:25:30
JON CARLSON With your strategy, is it important to use more than one modality to increase the likelihood that change will be permanent? 

01:25:40
ART FREEMAN I think the more modalities we can use, the better, at any point. So, we have three, thoughts, feelings, behavior. We've done behavior. I want to give her choice, thoughts or feelings. She picks it more often learning. 

01:25:55
JON CARLSON It seems like at times you are actually a teacher and you are educating the client on various topics. Is that a regular part of your approach? 

01:26:05
ART FREEMAN Yeah! I think the psycho educational piece is important, because very often the problems people have comes as a result of poor skills, lack of knowledge. 

01:26:15
JON CARLSON Ignorance! 

01:26:20
ART FREEMAN And so we'll see if can we give them some information. And I do wanna tease apart the thoughts of feelings, because I'm gonna deal with them differently. How are you feeling right now? 

01:26:30
KARLA ROGERS It's still like a loss of… it’s a loss of… it's like a loss of control. You know, it's like I'm crying and I can’t stop. It's… My nose is running and, you know, it's… It's like I'm felling like the little kid again. I'm feeling like a… a little kid who can't control her emotions. 

01:26:55
ART FREEMAN Yeah! And what does that mean to you? If that were true, what does that mean? I mean, a little kid who can't control her emotions, what does that mean? 

01:27:05
KARLA ROGERS Somehow… Well, I'm usually… I was reprimanded for that. You know, you don’t… you don't show your emotions could be in a big baby, no we're just teasing you. 

01:27:20
ART FREEMAN And who said that? 

01:27:20
KARLA ROGERS Parents-mainly, people that I knew, not friends but, you know, other classmates. 

01:27:30
ART FREEMAN So, one of the pieces you learned was, how I can hide, what I'm feeling, you hide what you're doing, you hide what you are thinking and every once in a while break through as if they're just hear. 

01:27:45
[sil.] 

01:27:50
ART FREEMAN Do you think I've lost respect for you, that’s why you cried? 

01:27:55
DIANE KJOS You're… You're picking up on that secret again, you hide, you hide. Yeah, yeah, the whole… 

01:28:00
ART FREEMAN My hunches, Diane, there are lots of secrets that Karla has. 

01:28:05
DIANE KJOS Yeah, yeah! 

01:28:05
ART FREEMAN There are all kinds of things I'm thinking about, don’t cry, don’t show emotion. Was there childhood abuse, physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse, not unusual in these situations. But once again, I've got 45 minutes. I am not going to raise or open issues that I can’t effectively, reasonably, rationally and ethically close. 

01:28:30
DIANE KJOS Close, yeah! 

01:28:35
ART FREEMAN But I certainly have ideas. I'm not gonna say, you know, were you ever abused as a child, because of the context she's being videotaped. She hasn’t given me that much permission and it’s the first session, also coincidently the last, for us. But you're an ongoing therapist, I think we'll need to explore why she learned to keep secrets. 

01:29:00
JON CARLSON They may even be another secret there that you talked about later in which you made an assumption about her choice of partners. 

01:29:10
ART FREEMAN Yeah! What’s gonna come up is an… an interesting piece where I goofed, that’s coming up shortly. There is a mistake and I'll talk about that when we get to that. Let me share my reaction. I think you show an incredible amount of courage by be willing to do this. You could have just as easily come and said, I wanna talk about my ex-boyfriend. 

01:29:40
KARLA ROGERS Hmm…hmm… Yeah! 

01:29:45
ART FREEMAN And we could have spent out time talking about the relationship. 

01:29:50
KARLA ROGERS I've spent too much time on that anyway, but go ahead. 

01:29:50
ART FREEMAN I've made an assumption based on no data. It was an incorrect assumption and I think a big mistake. 

01:30:00
DIANE KJOS It may not have been incorrect, but it could have been incorrect. 

01:30:05
ART FREEMAN Talking about her boyfriend? 

01:30:05
DIANE KJOS Yeah! 

01:30:05
ART FREEMAN That it's heterosexist view, that I'm saying, she's a girl, she's a beautiful boy. I have no data at all whether she's heterosexual or homosexual. Her words are a relationship. I was cheated on. And I should have kept her words to talk about your relationship, talk about your partner. This is simply wrong. I mean, this was the mistake I made. I might have been right, I might have been wrong, I should have stuck to her language. 

01:30:45
JON CARLSON It may be another potential secret. 

01:30:45
ART FREEMAN It may be a potential secret. By way of closing, I will say that, if I have the opportunity to work with Karla, I'd really like to. In many ways, she is a wonderful kind of client to work with. She is bright, she is verbal, she is motivated. She has specific issues that we can start with. She, I think, learned pretty quickly about how the therapy works. I think she'd be really a… a good person to work with. I think that a brief therapy approach would work really well with her, because of her ability to… to focus. So, I think she'd be a great candidate for therapy. 

01:31:40
JON CARLSON I'd like to take time to thank you very much for showing us your approach to brief therapy. 

01:31:45
ART FREEMAN Thank you, it's been interesting being part of this and I'm… I'm really grateful for your questions and comments that I think helped to explain and expiate and make clear much of what was going on in the session. Thank you both. 

01:32:00
DIANE KJOS Thank you.
