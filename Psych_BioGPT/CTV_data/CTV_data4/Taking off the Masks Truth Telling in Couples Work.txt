RICH SIMON Welcome everyone, my name is Rich Simon editor of Psychotherapy Networker. Here's our Networker studio uh, and here we, we're all here for another installment of our latest uh, Webcast Who's Afraid of Couples Therapy? Uh, many of you have uh, seen our November, December issue devoted to this topic. If, what we're doing in this series is uh, uh, continuing the exploration with a number of the authors who wrote for that series issue some other couples therapists. Really taking a look at one of the most challenging modalities of, of therapeutic work, working with couples. There any number of highly charged issues and we've been uh, discussing those. Issues like secrets and affairs, dealing with high conflict couples and all kinds of uh, there's a level of potential volatility in couples therapy that's really in quite in contrast to the sedate comfort of a lot of traditional individual therapy. And uh, what we're trying to look at is, examine some of those issues and see how to handle them and what, what are some of the benefits of doing couples work that uh, in contrast to some other ways of approaching the kinds of issues people bring to us. We're very fortunate uh, today to have as our guest David Schnarch who is one of the contributors in our issue on Who's Afraid Of Couples Therapy. And without further ado, let me welcome him to this, to the, to our Webcast. David, how are you? 

00:01:45
DAVID SCHNARCH It's nice to be back with you Rich. 

00:01:50
RICH SIMON So, David, let's, let's go um, one of the things that you uh, one of your comments uh, that we had just before we went on is um, uh, that is you have a tendency to uh, say provocative things. And one of the, the uh, interesting and provocative things you said today, just before we went on is this idea that your, your idea is that most therapist as far as you can tell, with having seen a lot of clients who have been to other forms of therapy appear to live in Disneyland. Now what, what is it that you mean by that? What is this Disneyland that many other therapist live in? And how would you contrast that Disneyland to your view of what, what's going on with couples and the kind of frame of reference you bring to your world? 

00:02:35
DAVID SCHNARCH My comment really was that a lot of therapy is done as if people were living in Disney World. And what that involves is I think uh, a self aggrandizing, sudoempathetic view that many therapist have when they don't, aren't willing to really look at what human nature really is and then develop models of, of therapy that really enshrine uh, uh, uh, a really distorted, inaccurate, pedestrian view of what people, their clients really have come through in what they really have to deal with. And so, I happen to think of myself, now this maybe hard to believe as an optimist about human nature. 

00:03:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:03:25
DAVID SCHNARCH Because I think that um, I really believe that people can afford to look at the worst in them from the best in them and stand up instead of dancing around. And so, I think that uh, uh, helping people develop a basic human nature is terribly, terribly important. But I think we take it for granted when we assume defacto parents have that. And many people come from homes where parents lack basic decency and talking about this as we're talking about uh, uh, insecure attachment or ambivalent attachment doesn't begin to deal with the mayhem and animosity and ill will that goes on in homes. And so, for instance I have lots of people who come in and say, "I have fears of abandonment." And I say, "If your parents had abandoned you, you would be in better shape cuz they would of left you alone." 

00:04:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:04:25
DAVID SCHNARCH It's the, we view of the fact that your parents are there and likewise people always like to talk about the love they never got. And my point is the love you get can screw you up six time worse than the love you never got. And in science phenomena are much more caused by the presence of things than the absence of things, except in the fantasy world of psychotherapy. 

00:04:50
RICH SIMON Okay. So, let's, let's make some contrast and then we'll, what we're trying to do in the series and, and uh, I'd be very interested in exploring with you the, the craft as you, the particulars in the ways that given your frame of reference you move very quickly in your work to uh, uh, confront people with some harsh truths about themselves. But let's, let's start off. So, one of the things in your, and, and you do a very nice job. And I really recommend David's article called, Removing The Masks in our November, December issue. So one of the things you talk about is that your uh, your quarrel, you bas-, your fundamental disagreement with uh, what you refer to as attachment based psychotherapy. And this focus on this assumption that we all do the best we have with the best of intentions that we have uh, we have our, our wounded children, wounded children inside. But the therapist's job is to join with that wounded child to create that atmosphere of safety that uh, initially. And that through that bond of safety that's created and acceptance of those wounds uh, attachment wounds or early childhood wounds. That becomes the fund-, the foundation of the therapeutic relationship and the basis on which the therapeutic conversation can proceed. You don't uh, uh, you don't seem to buy into that particular idea, that set of assumptions about. 

00:06:15
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes. 

00:06:15
RICH SIMON So, so why don't you contrast your assumptions and, and uh, with that. 

00:06:20
DAVID SCHNARCH Okay. 

00:06:20
RICH SIMON That set of assumptions. 

00:06:20
DAVID SCHNARCH Well part, part of that set of assumptions that you're articulating is also the idea that when people do hurtful things that they're doing it without knowledge of what they're doing. And these are really misguided attempts at self protection. 

00:06:35
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:06:35
DAVID SCHNARCH And uh, this, this is also the tendency for therapist to put the absolute smilest possible face on whatever they hear. Which is offering people a palliative as soon as they walk in. Because the most important thing is safety and security. And when you're doing safety and security that hamstrings the therapist about the ability to deal with difficult things. Because when difficult things come up, things get heated, things get insecure. And uh, unfortunately to the attachment based therapist this is the ultimate no, no. You consistently have to be making people feel secure even if they are living with a monster or they happen to be a monster. 

00:07:20
RICH SIMON So in your, in your take on this, so the kinds of things that you're uh, in people who are using this approach are doing or saying? What does it sound like operationally? What are the kinds of practices, kind of concrete practices in psychotherapy that you uh, don't think are particularly helpful in the service of creating that safety? 

00:07:40
DAVID SCHNARCH Well, I think for instance finding out why people do things as opposed to: A. prior assuming that therapist knows why they're doing things. Um, I know that when you and I as married men do terrible things in our marriage we do that out of ignorance, we are always well meaning. 

00:08:00
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:08:00
DAVID SCHNARCH Uh, I'm willing to accord you and I about assumptions. 

00:08:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:08:00
DAVID SCHNARCH But I'm not quite so uh, uh, willing to offer that either to my wife of to anybody else. 

00:08:10
RICH SIMON I fell privileged, David. I'm very moved by that. 

00:08:10
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes. 

00:08:10
RICH SIMON Thank you. 

00:08:10
DAVID SCHNARCH Well, I, I don't mind having a collusive alliance with you Rich. 

00:08:15
RICH SIMON That's nice. 

00:08:15
DAVID SCHNARCH We're not married and we're not in therapy. 

00:08:15
RICH SIMON Very sleek guy. You're very sleek. Okay. 

00:08:20
DAVID SCHNARCH But my point is also that many therapist have a collusive alliance with clients 

00:08:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:08:25
DAVID SCHNARCH As opposed to collaborate alliance. And in a collaborate alliance you say it straight and you look for the truth. And you tell the truth even when it's personally disadvantageous and in contrast to emotion based therapy. What we teach is in a collaborative alliance, how you're feeling isn't important. You do what your responsible to do and your responsibilities are unilateral. And this is what helps people build stable relationships. And when everybody has the feeling of feeling from first. That also means when you piss me off I'm no longer responsible for doing what I'm supposed to do in our relationship. And you can't build a stable relationship, you can build a collusive alliance that way. So we see many, many people who've been in therapy 8, 10, 12 times. And they come to us and they walk into a very, very different world. So, for instance in the article a couple comes in and ostensibly this is a problem about uh, rapid orgasm that the guy's had all along but he's pretending he doesn't know the impact he's having on his wife. And that the real problem is that he's embarrassed. And it turns out he's not embarrassed by what he's doing. He likes torturing his wife. And so the idea that we are also, we can be very loving. But it's very easy to love and hate the same person at the same time. These are not mutually exclusive. And if you're gonna dose out your crap where better to do it than at home. Because you know people outside the house aren't gonna put up with it. So. 

00:10:00
RICH SIMON So let me bring a concept here that you uh, so we get this at the beginning of our conversation and, and um, this will I'm sure will be woven through the rest of it. So one of the things you talk uh, uh, right at the very beginning of your piece is your notions about mind mapping. 

00:10:15
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes. 

00:10:15
RICH SIMON And this ability that people have that you believe uh, therapist in particular many of us underestimate for. 

00:10:25
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes. 

00:10:25
RICH SIMON Really understanding what's, what's going on, what, what are impact is on other people. Talk to us about mind mapping, what you mean by it and how it, that, the mind mapping process works its way, in particularly troubled relationships. 

00:10:35
DAVID SCHNARCH Good. Well this is not just the belief system I happen to have. This is 30 years of latest, cutting edge brain science. Mind mapping wasn't really studied until the late 1980s because in the 1940s Pete Lazae(ph) got it wrong and told people that their, uh, uh, uh, rather kids were so self centered that they couldn't appreciate somebody else's perspective until they were 7 or 8. It turns out that not only can kids appreciate it, it comes on virtually automatic at age 4. It actually starts about age 2. But by the age of 4, and this is hard multiproven science that by the age of 4 a child understands that what people do is a function of what's in their mind. And that if you can understand what's in their mind you can predict their behavior. A 4-year old child can detect false beliefs in a parent's mind because that is the hallmark for among scientist of proving that a child has false, uh, mind mapping abilities. So when, a kid tells their first fibs and they think it's hysterical and they can hardly keep a straight face that is the ability of a child to have mind mapping ability. Uh, uh, uh, a child can begin to detect beliefs, belief based e, uh, uh, emotions that people have feelings based on how they see things by the age of 5 or 6. Uh, by the age of 4 children. 

00:12:05
RICH SIMON Say something about that, so uh, just translate that. So the, the, I think I'm following a thing about uh, being able to lie and you're influencing the view of another person about something that's happening, and you're trying. 

00:12:20
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes. 

00:12:20
RICH SIMON You're likely to see, see.(crosstalk) Belief based emotions. 

00:12:25
DAVID SCHNARCH Emotions. Yeah. 

00:12:25
RICH SIMON Okay. Can you say more about that. 

00:12:25
DAVID SCHNARCH That uh, uh, a child figures out that the way people feel is not based on reality it's based on how they see things. And they map out the belief that people have that produces the emotion that they have. Now this is much more sophisticated than anybody does therapy. Because most therapist do therapy in a way that they're not even taking into account what a 4-year old can do, more or less a 15 or a 50 year old can do. And it revolutionizes at about age 11. One of the other problems is because of the uh, buhedgeamony(ph) of attachment theory people have, who, who become aware of things like mind mapping get taught that it's, it's there for empathy. And in the world of therapy at the moment everything seems to have occurred in human nature for the purposes of empathy. 

00:13:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:13:20
DAVID SCHNARCH And it's not. Mind mapping comes from the reptilian brain system, we get it from amphibians. It is a survival mechanism. And it is very, very important for manipulating other people for deception. Con-artist who are qualitatively incapable of empathy are fantastic mind mappers. And so, humans are just, part, part of the reason that therapist are not better mind mappers than their clients is because humans in general are so good at doing mind mapping. We are natural mind mappers. And rather than the idea that you learn this from your parents. So if you come from a bad family you don't develop this ability. Which is idea which is very much promulgated in the field today. There is a little research that says if you come from a good house uh, you learn mind mapping a little bit better. There is no research that says if you come from a bad family you don't develop it. And there is luminous research that says if you come from a stinking family you get really good at this because somebody did a study. And it turns out that the times that people and families most talk about feeling states is when they're arguing. And so in terrible families the kid is sitting back like the audience watching his parents like they're at Wimbledon. And he is learning mind mapping. And so people who come from really terrible backgrounds rather than never developing mind mapping they are experts mind mappers. When your mother is a raging borderline or your father is brutal alcoholic you learn to map them all the time. But what you also learn to do is to mask your mind. And this is why therapist have come to the erroneous conclusion that their clients can't mind map because they're better mind mappers than the therapist. And they're screening their mind from being mapped. And when the client looks stupid unfortunately the therapist thinks this is because they're impaired as opposed to the client is mind mapping the therapist. Knows the picture that the therapist wants to see and presents it to them. 

00:15:35
RICH SIMON So, in other words life is a lot more like a Ingrid Birdman film that we like to believe. Therapist in your view have a, a kind of sentimental view of human nature and what, what's going on in their clients experience of them. In um, in your experience what, what you're seeing and you believe this is backed up by science is that there's uh, our capacity to mind mapping is much more calculated than that. It's not necessarily in the service of connection and empathy? 

00:16:05
DAVID SCHNARCH Absolutely. It can be used for empathy. But people have made lists of all the different services of mind mapping and empathy is 1 of 10. The other nine you're not gonna like. Cuz it's about manipulating other people, which is a function of social intelligence. Deception uh, being able to avoid consequence. And, this, this is just the deal. Now I don't have difficulty with people how have Pollyannaish views of nature as long as the only person that, that Pollyannaish view falls on is themselves. 

00:16:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:16:40
DAVID SCHNARCH When you're a therapist it's self serving and then when you think of all the money that is spent and wasted. We have a social problem. This is not a turf fight or a conceptual argument among therapist. We are talking about a very serious, very pragmatic social welfare problem. 

00:17:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:17:00
DAVID SCHNARCH Because people are packaging their experience into this uh, very acculturated, very idealistic view. But it is collusive and there are lots of people out there who are hurting who need help. And we need to get off of our butts and stop doing the self grandizing thing where we are empathizing with nonsense. And also confront ourselves. Because here's what I can tell you. Now, uh, I just finished the therapist workshop. 

00:17:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:17:30
DAVID SCHNARCH When therapist finish our workshop they always have two reactions, always. One is, I gonna go home and be nicer to my partner. 

00:17:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:17:40
DAVID SCHNARCH And the other is; I'm a stop collating with my clients. 

00:17:40
RICH SIMON Okay. All right. So, let, let's, let's take this to the next step then. So, and mind mapping. So you're gonna mind map the consciousness, the therapeutic consciousness of David Schnarch. 

00:17:55
DAVID SCHNARCH Okay. 

00:17:55
RICH SIMON So, I'd like to uh, uh, let, let's give people the flavor of how you work and one of the things that you describe in your uh, in your piece is how quickly you move in to saying things, difficult things. Things most people, at least that I know. 

00:18:10
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes. 

00:18:10
RICH SIMON Would prefer not from their therapist. 

00:18:15
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes. 

00:18:15
RICH SIMON And when it, in your experiences is, it proves to be quite helpful for them. 

00:18:15
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes. 

00:18:15
RICH SIMON So let's start off. So, the, the couple and we'll, we'll. 

00:18:20
DAVID SCHNARCH How about a new case? 

00:18:20
RICH SIMON For example, you, you care to. But before the couple comes into see you for the first time. You're, you're there, you're um. I think many uh, many therapist in their mindset, how do I make people comfortable, how do I create a, an environment where there's a sense of, of safety. People feel like uh, they can begin to tell me things and I'm not gonna uh, be, challenge them in any particular-, uh, particularly early on in our conversation. Um, I'm globalizing here but that's I think a mindset of therapist generally, and, and um, and couples uh, therapists. 

00:19:00
DAVID SCHNARCH A good one. 

00:19:00
RICH SIMON Tell us more about how you would describe uh, if to, to remove your own mind mask in your, uh, your uh, how you get ready for a session. What's the set that you have in your head before folks come into see you? 

00:19:15
DAVID SCHNARCH Well, generally virtually everybody I see is on the verge of divorce. They have failed in therapy five and six times. Evergreen, Colorado is not our new way home. An so uh, by the time you come to me you tried all the easy solutions. Uh, these are also people who have been in individual therapy for years, they uh, are not getting anywhere, they often have kids, their marriage is falling apart. Their kids are symptomatic. And um, I'm not interested in having people feel secure. I'm here, I'm interested in having people feel like they have hope. And the people that I see are virtually all demoralized. And speed creates hope. The quicker you see yourself and your partner stand up and get into stuff and deal with stuff and come out the other side successfully that's what gives you hope. When you're doing the baby step approach it's like slow bloodletting. 

00:20:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:20:10
DAVID SCHNARCH And the longer it takes and you're mapping your therapist so the more hesitant they are the more you have the feeling of, "Oh, he thinks I'm really screwed up. That's what this is." 

00:20:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:20:20
DAVID SCHNARCH He things that we're in bad shape. And I don't want them to have that. I want them to see that I really think that they can do something. So I know I'm going to be doing a therapy that they're gonna thing they just stepped in, into warp speed therapy. 

00:20:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:20:40
DAVID SCHNARCH Most people when they come in, everybody says, "I've never seen anything like this." And they stay. Everybody says, when you talk hard to people don't they get up and walk out. And I'm telling you virtually nobody walks out. They're people who walk out and come back and say, you know, I don't like you. And I say, that's fine, that's part of the fee too. You don't have to like me. 

00:21:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:21:05
DAVID SCHNARCH But what's more important is you come out and hopefully the two of you like yourselves and each other, okay. And that's what's important. And so, I know that there are a lot of people that come and say, you're the last resort. This is it. We're, we're gonna break up. So I have the feeling I need to do something. 

00:21:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:21:20
DAVID SCHNARCH And I see people who do lots of nasty things to each other. And can't cope with it and they've seen therapist who can't cope with it. So should I tell you about this case that I've seen recently? 

00:21:30
RICH SIMON So, and, and let's just frame it a little bit. So in terms of uh, whatever uh, we, we've, in this series we talk to people about how they kind of a structure they may have initially, certainly when they start off in their work. Do you have a, a structure for a first session? Are there certain things and, and then you can exemplify this with this case you're gonna tell us about. 

00:21:50
DAVID SCHNARCH Sure. Uh, I, I sit down and I say to you, uh, how can I be of help. 

00:22:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:22:00
DAVID SCHNARCH And what do you think I need to know to be of help. 

00:22:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:22:05
DAVID SCHNARCH And that's says we're gonna start fullboard. And sometimes the people will want to dance around and say, um, uh, I prefer that you ask me questions. And I say, I just did. 

00:22:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:22:20
DAVID SCHNARCH And they say, well will you ask me some other ones. 

00:22:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:22:25
DAVID SCHNARCH And I say, well what's the matter with the one I asked you? 

00:22:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:22:25
DAVID SCHNARCH And they go, I don't like that. And I say, well I thought you were coming to me for my professional expertise? 

00:22:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:22:35
DAVID SCHNARCH Okay. And very, very quickly. There's an example that looks like we're dancing around and we're kidding around. But it's very, very serious. And the client is saying you do this the way that I want to do it. 

00:22:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:22:45
DAVID SCHNARCH And I'm saying, no. 

00:22:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:22:50
DAVID SCHNARCH I'm asking you a question. 

00:22:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:22:50
DAVID SCHNARCH This is my professional judgment. I expect you to answer it. 

00:22:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:22:55
DAVID SCHNARCH Which is also, I don't follow my clients anywhere they lead me. 

00:22:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:23:00
DAVID SCHNARCH I ask them a question and if they don't answer it. And they give me an answer to the question that they want. Which is what you learn to do when you're interviewed on TV. You know, you stay on message and you answer the question you want. I say, I really appreciate you telling me that. That's very interesting. Now do you want me to ask you that question again. 

00:23:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:23:20
DAVID SCHNARCH And I make it clear that you're paying me for my expertise and I have some judgment about what's going on. And I don't claim to be right. I'm a married man, so I know I make a lot of mistakes. 

00:23:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:23:35
DAVID SCHNARCH And I'm just responsible for doing the best that I can. And you can buy my services. And if you don't like what I'm doing you, you can find more reasonable, more loving, more genuine, more compassionate therapist like the ones you've had that have led you to come to me. 

00:23:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay. All right. And so, what is it that you're? Now everything, and, and what I'd like to do as we go through this is, is cuz this is really a series about craft. So I'm gonna be coming back to, not so much of certainly you're in a relationship and the, we're, we're, we'll find out about the, the couple that you're gonna tell us about. But I'm really interested in your approach to craft and how you, your part of organizing the interaction when people come into your office and come for a first session. So, okay. You've, you've asked your, your questions. And so part of that, that particular question about, uh how can I, how can I help you. 

00:24:30
DAVID SCHNARCH Uh, I might, that question says you have to get out front. 

00:24:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:24:35
DAVID SCHNARCH You're not gonna be able to hang out back. I expect you to work. 

00:24:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:24:40
DAVID SCHNARCH And you have to get out front and you're gonna carry some responsibility for what we talk about. So, particularly at the beginning you know what's important for me to hear and not, okay. So, if you want to tell me little tangential, meaningless stuff and sit on the big stuff, that's up to you, okay. 

00:25:00
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:25:00
DAVID SCHNARCH But I'm saying, why don't we use your time well. Talk to me about the most important stuff first. And I will sit here and see what kind of judgment you have and just how much of an artery you're willing to open up. So I am immediately accessing people's willing to self confront, people's willing to calm themselves down, people's willingness to tell the truth even when it's personally disadvantageous or their tendency to blame, get over reactive. And I'm accessing what we call the four points of balance, and the fourth point is uh, what's called meaningful endurance. The willingness to tolerate discomfort for growth. And so, right off the bat, I'm making an invivo assessment of how well or poorly differentiated is this couple and what are they willing to do. So, I'm looking at process as much as I'm looking at content. 

00:25:55
RICH SIMON So at, once you pose that question and they respond whatever way. Some of them fence with you, they don't wanna answer it, some I imagine take, take it quite literally and try to give you uh, uh, uh, as full an answer to it as possible. And if, so if I was watching you in a session during the first 10, 15 minutes which I, I'm certainly getting a sense a lot more is going on in your, your, uh. And you have a rather ambitious agenda in comparison I think to many couples therapist. Let me, what else are you doing? What else is going on for you within that first uh, 10, 15 minutes of a session? 

00:26:35
DAVID SCHNARCH Uh, as, as I said, I'm not just listening to issues and content I'm watching the, the (crosstalk) each. 

00:26:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:26:40
DAVID SCHNARCH Each person's ability. 

00:26:45
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:26:45
DAVID SCHNARCH I'm watching how they're interacting with each other. 

00:26:45
RICH SIMON Oh. 

00:26:45
DAVID SCHNARCH One of the advantages of conjoined therapy of this opposed to individual therapy is you get to see the partner's reaction. Where's an individual therapy you can make up any kakamami(ph) story you want and your partner, your therapist, rather is gonna empathize. 

00:27:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:27:00
DAVID SCHNARCH In part because they don't have anything to cross reference it to. So I'm watching the partner's reaction to what he's saying. I'm watching their dancing around about who's gonna talk first. I'm watching is the first person to talk eager to talk or is it that, their other partner is so recalcitrant and so stuck that they, the first person to speak feels obligated to talk to get the ball rolling. And very, very quickly within five minutes or so you can get an extreme about of information about what's going on, and that's what I'm looking for. 

00:27:35
RICH SIMON And one of the things anyone whose read your piece. If they haven't I certainly recommend that they do. Not only are you observing but then you're pointing out what you're seeing quite early in a session. 

00:27:45
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes. 

00:27:45
RICH SIMON So you, you, and it's. How do? Tell us a little bit about that decision making. What do you, what kinds of, what's your idea about, what are you trying to accomplish in pointing out what you're seeing and, and again take us into those first few. 

00:28:00
DAVID SCHNARCH Sure. 

00:28:00
RICH SIMON Moments in session. 

00:28:00
DAVID SCHNARCH Well here's one of the things that we teach a lot of therapist think that they can control the pace of the session and the more difficult the couple, the more embittered they are or the less cognizant they seem to be or insightful about what they're doing. The therapist immediately start dialing down their expectations for the speed of what they're gonna do. They start thinking they have to coach their terms in more lofty terms, and not really talk straight to people. What we teach people is couples dictate the speed at which the, the therapist has to intervene because when the couples start making moves on each other if you don't get in there and intervene then they run away with the session. So, we teach the therapist that, you don't want to be ahead of your client but you don't want to be four yards behind. You want to be a half step behind. So I'm watching to see what the couples are doing. And it is amazing many couples will destroy their therapy within the first 15 minutes. And they will start misconstructing it. 

00:29:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:29:05
DAVID SCHNARCH And if the client, if the therapist just follows the misconstruction, doesn't matter if you're in there for six months it's been misconstructed from the start. 

00:29:15
RICH SIMON Six months? Let's say a little bit. So you, when you're saying they've destroyed the therapy or it's misconstructed, what's happening that you, it's destroying the therapy or misconstructing? 

00:29:20
DAVID SCHNARCH Yeah. Well, for instance a couple comes in that uh, uh, uh, somebody's had an affair. Um, and um, they're, they're, you know, the, the, the uh, uh, resolute spouse is going how could you do this to me. And the uh, person whose had the affair that they've happen to not only had an affair but they also had the affair in the marital bed. Turns to the person who's crying and says, "Well you know I'd never do anything to, deliberately hurt you dear." 

00:29:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:30:00
DAVID SCHNARCH And at that point, I have to intervene or the therapy is over. And I have to say, um, I, I have bad news for you uh, uh, I think therapy is over right here because I don't treat people who don't deliberately do things to hurt each other. 

00:30:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:30:10
DAVID SCHNARCH And so, I'm saying right here, you're floating the grand lie. And if you're gonna stick to this we don't got any point talking here. 

00:30:20
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:30:20
DAVID SCHNARCH And it's very bold for somebody to put that right up front. 

00:30:25
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:30:25
DAVID SCHNARCH And I take that off the table because I'm not kidding. There is no point in going forward if I don't take this right off the table now. Where it's not like I'm gonna do this piece meal taking it apart. Uh, you know, like unraveling the Gordian knot, you know. Uh, well were you angry at her? Uh, you know, it's to give you an example of mind mapping. It's uh, look we've only got two possibilities. If you're banging somebody in your marital bed, either you're figuring your wife is gonna figure this out or she's not. Which one it is for you? And see once you go down, even the one. I'm banging this person in the bed and I'm figuring she's not gonna know, okay. Well, then all of a sudden you're, you're an affairess guy. And then the next picture is while you're doing that you think you're gonna get away with these, are you gloating? I don't think you're crying and going, Oh my poor wife. 

00:31:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:31:15
DAVID SCHNARCH And when you think she's, we go the other way and you think she's gonna find out that there's this stain in the bed, and there's this smell in the bed. What, what do you, what do you figuring? You know. Oh, my poor wife or are you figuring good? 

00:31:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:31:35
DAVID SCHNARCH And I'm saying, if you're gonna put all chips on the table and make a bluff, let's do it know because we're not gonna be able to take this off the table less, yesterday. So it's the solution to the Gordian knot. Which is you cut right through it. 

00:31:45
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:31:45
DAVID SCHNARCH And you say to that person if you're gonna make this move, okay. That's a big, I, I wouldn't say that's a big time perp move; although it is. 

00:31:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:31:55
DAVID SCHNARCH Uh, I don't have to alienate him while I'm also trying to work with him at this point. 

00:32:00
RICH SIMON So this. 

00:32:00
DAVID SCHNARCH And I say. 

00:32:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:32:05
DAVID SCHNARCH Okay, go ahead. 

00:32:05
RICH SIMON So they're, so they're lay. Here you are. So let, let's just stay with that moment there. So that, so there was a line between challenging and, and uh, creating a different kind of culture I suppose, in the therapy room and alienating people. So what is, what's your experience and what's your own mind mapping of the client's response based on having done this for uh, many years; this particular approach. About you're, you're 10, 15 minutes into a relationship and you're, you're confronting people with uh, a, with a way of understanding their situation that most of us might, would find extremely different, difficult to talk about. And the uh, and the, the attribution that comes out of such a conversation does, does not make us feel good about ourselves. So how is it, what? 

00:32:55
DAVID SCHNARCH That's, that's what's so funny, you know. It's like, in, in the example I'm referring out, right. 

00:33:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:33:00
DAVID SCHNARCH The guy, the guy's having an affair, right. 

00:33:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:33:05
DAVID SCHNARCH And he's doing all this cruel stuff. 

00:33:05
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:33:05
DAVID SCHNARCH Okay. And either, either you play it, he likes the idea in his mind of his wife, you know, hurting over this. Or he doesn't give a rat's ass. Either way, they don't give you the Noble Prize for the best husband of the year. 

00:33:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:33:25
DAVID SCHNARCH But then the idea about when you say to him, you know, you, you, if, we, we got two possibilities. You either enjoy your wife hurting or she's collateral damage and you don't give a rat's ass. 

00:33:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:33:35
DAVID SCHNARCH The idea that all of a sudden I'm saying something terrible, okay. He is doing terrible but it's okay to do terrible as long as we don't talk about it. We put a smiley face on it. I'm, and also, see that guy when he makes that move he really believes he's gonna get over that. He's gonna get through this. And that is a guy that is saying he thinks therapy is bullshit. And he knows from experience, particularly if he's been in therapy, he makes that move, he is showing you his picture of therapy and therapist. And he has no respect for the process. And I am saying to him first move, if you're gonna stay and if we're gonna do therapy this is gonna be a no BS therapy. 

00:34:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:34:25
DAVID SCHNARCH And that's the deal. Now, if you want to do real therapy with no BS, anything is fair game, nothing is too terrible to talk about. I'll be glad to work with you, okay. If that isn't what you want, you bought my time, I will sit here, okay. I will try not to look too dumb and too duplicitous but I'm really being real straight with you that I'm gonna do that not because I believe what you're saying. But because you're telling me that's what you want. And for a limited amount of time I'll do that. 

00:35:00
RICH SIMON So this is interesting. So, what, let me pause for a second. So, what's happening here, so your assumption about this and your experience of doing this, this kind of work is you have to be an optimist. Because what you're basically say is when people feel that you get them, that they're seen. That you are bullshit detector or your mind mapping ability as a therapist is that, is really captures their inner world in a way they may not have even, I don't know admitted this to themselves. But the moment that you're saying this there has to have som-, rather than, this is not just an attack from a stranger. 

00:35:40
DAVID SCHNARCH Right. 

00:35:40
RICH SIMON But this is a uh, an insight from someone who is an expert in understanding some of these twists and turns of human motivation. So at the point in which you say that they need to be at some level intrigued and motivated that somebody has gotten them. I'm, I'm just trying this out. 

00:36:00
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes. 

00:36:00
RICH SIMON That basically how you see what's going on. 

00:36:00
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes, and they're also unsettled because immediately the feeling of this is not going like I planned. 

00:36:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:36:10
DAVID SCHNARCH Okay. And you're also making the very important point which I appreciate because a lot of people want to position me as, I have no capacity for empathy. I had it surgically removed. And now empathy is now stylized as a kind of uh-huh, I know how you feel, okay. Where you really don't. And I'm displaying a kind of empathy which is you're in deep trouble and you're not getting anywhere and your marriage is about to break up. 

00:36:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:36:40
DAVID SCHNARCH So my version of empathy is I'ma talk straight to you. Which is, then you ask in the first five minutes. It's important not to be on a moral triad. 

00:36:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:36:50
DAVID SCHNARCH It's important not to be angry at these people, including when they're lying to your face. 

00:36:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:36:55
DAVID SCHNARCH Because it's not about anger, it's about caring and the willingness to cut through people's crap to get down to what's real so that they can solve the problems that they have. And so, for instance I've seen people tentively destroy a therapy in the first five minutes where I say to them, "Your therapy is gonna fail because you're trying to solve a problem you don't have. And you can only get better by solving a problem you do have and you are misconstructing your situation." 

00:37:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. And. 

00:37:30
DAVID SCHNARCH And some of it is knowing. Knowing that you. 

00:37:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. So what is the problem? The problem you're trying to solve a problem you don't have. So just be a little more concrete with me. So what is it, what are you referring to there? 

00:37:40
DAVID SCHNARCH So for instance the guy, they guy who says I would never do anything to hurt you. But I think this has happened because we have a communication problem. 

00:37:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:37:50
DAVID SCHNARCH He lists he has a communication problem that he doesn't have. 

00:37:55
RICH SIMON I see. 

00:37:55
DAVID SCHNARCH Believe me, when he's banging some girl in his wife's bed, they're communicating and mind mapping is a level of virtually automatic communication. It comes on board, you don't learn it from your mother, okay. It's a brain module, comes on board almost fully developed. And this is brain science, there's lots of research to support this view. Which is not the empathy simulation attachment view. And so couples are always communicating. So I just help people tolerate the communication that's already there. And couples are, the, couples do not have difficulty communicating. Couples have difficulty tolerating the message. And if communication was worse for a lot of couples then you really didn't know the way that your partner loathes you. 

00:38:45
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:38:45
DAVID SCHNARCH And the way that your partner sees you, people would be nicer to each other. 

00:38:45
RICH SIMON So. Okay. 

00:38:50
DAVID SCHNARCH But there's tremendous mind mapping going on. 

00:38:50
RICH SIMON So how, what is it about how you deliver the message. So you, you've, I am, um, in, in a, I'm getting from what you're saying that in the course of a session, 10, 15 minutes into a session you begun to get into this kind of material. You are giving them a. 

00:39:10
DAVID SCHNARCH Yeah. 

00:39:10
RICH SIMON A readout of your own mind mapping. 

00:39:15
DAVID SCHNARCH Yeah. 

00:39:15
RICH SIMON Of, of there's. And how, what is it about how you are able to deliver what you're saying, to people in a way that doesn't make them feel attacked, in a way that just makes them wanna go out the door, um, and what is it? And, and how do you? Um, do you in fact, this is a somewhat different thing but it just occurred to me. Do you ever find yourself just getting really angry at people? And dealing, if you're so attuned in to this quality, this kind of insidious quality and this disingenuous quality of people uh, uh, do you find? What is it that you do internally so you don't feel angry or judgmental about these, these folks where, where you're, you're seeing that they're being fundamentally in your view dishonest? 

00:40:05
DAVID SCHNARCH Uh, if I felt like I had to put up with that treatment then I think I would get angry. 

00:40:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:40:10
DAVID SCHNARCH But instead what I'm doing is turning something that could be angry into something useful and that is there's no reason for me to be angry. It ain't personal. They're doing what they do and I'm watching what they do. And this is the way I relate. Why would I not want them to do what they're doing. It's the only way I can see how they operate. 

00:40:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:40:35
DAVID SCHNARCH So, they're doing what they should do. And I'm willing to see it. Uh, with couples where I don't have to respond in the first 15 minutes, my preference is not to. It's the couples where they, things are gonna go bad so quickly and things are gonna get misconstructed then I have to respond in the first 15 minutes. But it wouldn't be uncommon for me not to say much, you know. I, I'll interact and keep the conversation going but to not really in many ways show my hand and show what I'm saying, seeing for an hour sometimes. 

00:41:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:41:10
DAVID SCHNARCH Okay. 

00:41:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:41:10
DAVID SCHNARCH But that's uh, when a session will go when I have more time. It's not like I go through the whole session about that. 

00:41:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:41:15
DAVID SCHNARCH But the quicker that the couple needs it, even if they don't understand it. That will determine how quickly that I will, I will respond. And so the key is you have to talk from the best in you to the best in other people. 

00:41:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:41:30
DAVID SCHNARCH And that's the key. It's not talking to the uh, malevolent part of people because the malevolent part of people will just tie up in knots and just debate with you. 

00:41:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:41:40
DAVID SCHNARCH It's getting the best in them to talk about the worst in them because the worst in us lies about it's own existence. 

00:41:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:41:50
DAVID SCHNARCH So, and, and so you can't, if you're angry at them you're not responding out of the best in you. So, that's what they get. They get that this is not some kind off the cuff, you know, uh, uh, sarcastic response. 

00:42:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:42:05
DAVID SCHNARCH That there really is some substance to this. And if it's hard to hear it's hard to hear for a reason. I'm trying to get your attention. 

00:42:15
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:42:15
DAVID SCHNARCH And you're just going on and on. And so we also teach, you use the lightest touch that will get you therapeutic traction. 

00:42:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:42:25
DAVID SCHNARCH And when you don't have much traction or people are really just starting to, just spinning off, then you have to use a little bit harder uh, uh, touch until you get traction and then you can ease up again. So, it's not slash and burn therapy. 

00:42:40
RICH SIMON I know. 

00:42:40
DAVID SCHNARCH And take no prisoners. 

00:42:40
RICH SIMON Okay. So, all right. So say a little bit more before we move ahead into the session. This, this last thing you said, I think seems very important to me, which is you have to speak from the best of you to the best in, to the best in them. 

00:42:50
DAVID SCHNARCH Yeah. 

00:42:55
RICH SIMON And that, that, and there's this uh, and. What is, so talk about that. Because so far we've been talking about this uh, part of people that is not so lovely. 

00:43:05
DAVID SCHNARCH Right. 

00:43:05
RICH SIMON And can often be actively malevolent. 

00:43:05
DAVID SCHNARCH Yeah. 

00:43:05
RICH SIMON And uh, even predatory. So where's this, what's this best in people that you're talking about? How do you identify that or how do you think about that? 

00:43:15
DAVID SCHNARCH It's, it's the part of us that knows right from wrong. It's a part of us that has a kind of basic decency. Even in all world there were rules of engagement. 

00:43:30
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:43:30
DAVID SCHNARCH There, there, so, that's, that's a combative alliance, okay. But there is still rules. There are lots of families, lots of marriages where either there's a collusive alliance. And when that breaks down there's no alliance it's hit below the belt, go for the jugular, there is no level about how far you will go, you will go. You will sink, okay. People who have basic decency will fight in couples, will do nasty things but there is a limit to how far they will go. And then they will have this feeling that says, I, I, the next thing I'm gonna say I know once I say that we're done. I can't say that, that's too far. I want my partner to hurt but I can't do that, okay. That's the best in people in the middle of the worst in them there is the part of us that knows right from wrong. And if you see in the newspaper it's happening all the time now. There's a rash of these parents that seem to be somehow losing their kids conveniently, right. And there are a lot of us that would love to lose our kids. 

00:44:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:44:35
DAVID SCHNARCH But we can't do that. They're, that is we just can't go that far. And there are many people who do not have basic decency, they didn't grow up in houses that have basic decency. And they're growing up in a house where people do disgusting things and it's gonna turn out in 10 years that getting away from talking about nonsense, like insecure attachment and talking about disgusting parents will be important because disgust is a hardwired brain reaction. 

00:45:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:45:10
DAVID SCHNARCH And so, being finally willing to break out of this Disney World view of attachment and begin to understand that there are lots of people that do disgusting things and they won't stop has a tremendous impact on brain wiring and traumatic mind mapping. 

00:45:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:45:30
DAVID SCHNARCH Okay, so when I'm working with people I'm trying. I, I mean any therapist knows how to really do things lousy. Any therapist who's worth their salt is a good liar. Any therapist who's a good therapist is a wonderful manipulator. Hopefully you do it for, for good reasons at least in your office. 

00:45:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:45:50
DAVID SCHNARCH But the point is, is that uh, if you can't recognize the worst in you as a therapist, you're not gonna be much of a therapist. Because you won't be able to tell whether you're operating out of the best or the worst in you. 

00:46:05
RICH SIMON Okay. So let's, let's move a little ahead cuz we're, we, we have about 15 minutes or so to, and I want make sure that we have the time to give people uh, a sense of this uh, a broader sense of the process. 

00:46:15
DAVID SCHNARCH Okay. 

00:46:15
RICH SIMON So you begun to get a sense of what's going on, what are the patterns with, within this couple. 

00:46:20
DAVID SCHNARCH Right. 

00:46:25
RICH SIMON And, and it, and, and if, if it feels uh, it, it fits for you and, and it seems like it's otherwise you're, the therapy is gonna be subverted you uh, quite directly you wind up uh, feeding that back to people, confronting them. 

00:46:40
DAVID SCHNARCH Yeah. 

00:46:40
RICH SIMON And, and what, don't sound very much like much of the therapy talk that I'm familiar with. 

00:46:45
DAVID SCHNARCH Mm-hmm. 

00:46:45
RICH SIMON So what else, and so in a first session, what else are you? So once you've done that where do you, what do you want to accomplish? So you, you hopefully people get the sense, boy this guy gets me and he sees through me. And implicitly he seems to believe, unless they feel like you're just trying to come at them. Which uh, you're, from you're experience is that they don't experience it that way. 

00:47:10
DAVID SCHNARCH Right. 

00:47:10
RICH SIMON But there's an optimism in it. They, they can, that there's, you're also speaking to the best in them. They can, that's not all of them, as part of your method of calling them about. 

00:47:15
DAVID SCHNARCH Right. 

00:47:15
RICH SIMON What else, where do you go from there? 

00:47:20
DAVID SCHNARCH Well that's completely dependent on the couple because what we're really talking about is co-construction. Which we take very, very serious, okay. Telling people that they that they have fears of abandonment is co-construction, it constructs them as weak and fragile. I'm trying to construct my clients as strong and resilient. So part of what I'm gonna do in the rest of the session is trying to figure out what is the necessary proper or helpful co-construction. So if we talk more specific about a case I could give you an example. 

00:47:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:47:55
DAVID SCHNARCH About an intervention. Okay. 

00:48:00
RICH SIMON Okay. Let's do it. 

00:48:00
DAVID SCHNARCH Couple comes in, they've been married for 25 years. They haven't had sex in the last 10 years on the wife's choice. And the wife doesn't want to have sex with the husband. The husband wants to stay married. It sort of looks like maybe the wife might be thinking about getting out. They walk in and the guy is screaming, and he's screaming, "How could you do this to me!" "How could you talk to me when I'm trying to have sex with you, telling me that when we start to have sex you're thinking about another guy?" "How could you have a uh, uh, a long term affair with one of my best friends for over a decade?" "How could you not have sex with me and tell me that you want to go to one of these sexual alternative lifestyles?" Which basically is a big swinging party. "And tell me you don't want me to go because you want to have experiences there that you can't have if I'm there. How can you tell these things to me?" And it looks like he's pounding on his wife emotionally. She looks sort of sheepish and you know, a little apologetic. And I'm listening to this and I say to him, there are no rhetorical questions in my office, what's the answers. 

00:49:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:49:10
DAVID SCHNARCH And he says, "What?" And I said, well you're, you're. Oh, and the other thing is, she is telling him now that uh, for the last year that she never had any sexual desire, attraction for him at any time in the history of their marriage. Which he says he sort of remembers that at the beginning uh, he thought that she did have sexual desire. At the beginning they had, she's telling him, no, you're wrong. It was never there. So, he says, you know, "How could you, how could you uh, uh, tell me that uh, we're lying in bed uh, and you're having thoughts about another guy when you won't have sex with me?" And I say, "What, what's the difficulty? What don't you understand there?" When you're saying how could she do it, you're talking like you don't know this woman's mind. Now you have this woman's mind mapped backwards and forwards but for some reason you're acting like you don't. And I don't think it's just some reason, I think there's a good reason why you're acting like you don't. And so, he says, "I don't know." And I said, "Why do you think she's telling you that she never had desire for you at all." He says, "I don't know." I said, how do you make sense out of the fact that your wife isn't having sex with you but she's telling you she wants to go and have sex with other guys. And she had this affair. 

00:50:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:50:25
DAVID SCHNARCH He says, "I don't know." I say, I think I have it figured out. The problem is your wife doesn't like having sex with dumb guys." 

00:50:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:50:40
DAVID SCHNARCH Now this is not to. 

00:50:40
RICH SIMON This is 15 minutes into the first session? 

00:50:45
DAVID SCHNARCH Yeah, this is within 15 minutes. 

00:50:45
RICH SIMON 15 minutes, all right. 

00:50:50
DAVID SCHNARCH Because it's I think, it's very clear what his wife is doing. 

00:50:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:50:55
DAVID SCHNARCH And it's very clear that she is not only treating him like he's stupid, he is acting like he's stupid because he doesn't want what's gonna happen if he acts like he understands what's happening. Cuz then he's gonna be forced to make a decision that he doesn't want. And so when I, and so I now have to construct a smart man because it's real clear as long as he plays dumb man this things gonna fall apart. This, this couple has also has, has histories of decades of therapy uh, that have gotten nowhere. When I say to him, basically you're acting like a dumb guy, stop acting like a dumb guy, he sobers up and he gets quiet. And the wife is all big eyes. And I say to him, you tell me why does your wife keep telling you that she's never had any desire for you, even though you think she did. And he says, "Because she's trying to hurt my feelings. And because she's trying to tell me it's hopeless because she wants me to agree to a divorce." 

00:52:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:52:05
DAVID SCHNARCH So within 90 seconds of my saying to him your wife doesn't like to have sex with stupid guys. He stops acting like a stupid guy and he demonstrates mind mapping capacity. 

00:52:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:52:15
DAVID SCHNARCH And see couples play with trying to take off the table that they have mind mapping ability because it gives them more room to screw around, more room to play with the data to misconstruct it. All of a sudden now, although I said something hard to him, I'm actually treating him with respect. I am saying to him, you're a smart guy acting dumb. There's actually a good reason why you're acting dumb and we draw this all out and the next thing she's now sitting there with a guy she's never seen before. Cuz he ain't acting dumb, he's also implicitly saying, pushed far enough he is willing to settle down, take the hit, start, stop crapping around. And he's saying to her I see you. I keep acting like I don't. I see you. And so this is a nice symmorphic(ph) intervention and within 15 minutes now or 17 minutes into the session. 

00:53:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:53:15
DAVID SCHNARCH We are playing a different game. And now what will happen next in the rest of the session will be different because I started to co-construct a competent man. 

00:53:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:53:25
DAVID SCHNARCH And so, this is doing therapy on a, on a much more sophisticated level and a much faster level that many people aren't used to seeing. And that's what these couples need. They need to stop thinking that they know the pace of therapy and they uh. I'll tell you the wife stood, sat up in her chair and she looked at this. And suddenly she doesn't look quite so apologetic. 

00:53:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:53:55
DAVID SCHNARCH And um, uh, she, she looks different, he starts to look different. And I am now co-constructing a different couple that walked. 

00:54:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:54:05
DAVID SCHNARCH Into my office 20 minutes ago. And that's where the. 

00:54:05
RICH SIMON So, so let's, let's follow through on this process uh, in the time that's remaining. So, okay. So, what's, what happens? You, you certainly got my attention. So what's this new, you, you so it's like a new doorway opens for a different. 

00:54:20
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes. 

00:54:20
RICH SIMON Kind of interaction between these two folks. 

00:54:25
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes. 

00:54:25
RICH SIMON And what's that interaction like? And then at that stage and, and let's continue to focus on your contribution here. 

00:54:30
DAVID SCHNARCH Sure. 

00:54:30
RICH SIMON Where is it, what kind of thera-, what are you doing? 

00:54:35
DAVID SCHNARCH Well, right now I, I know have an alliance with the best in him. 

00:54:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:54:40
DAVID SCHNARCH So we've changed the alliance. This is not about insight, okay. I now have an alliance with him. The wife is tracking this, she's a mind mapper too. 

00:54:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:54:45
DAVID SCHNARCH She is watching that all of a sudden her husband isn't acting like a dope. 

00:54:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:54:50
DAVID SCHNARCH And he could see her and he's also willing to take the hit where up to now, she's pushing him, pushing him. And he keeps backing up. He's not backing up now. The dynamics are changing, the alliance is in therapy and changing. This is happening all along. And now everything's different. I have an alliance with the best in him. And I said, so I turn to her and I say, "I never take what one person says as being true about the other till I hear it from the other. So I have absolutely no idea what's going on in your life." 

00:55:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:55:25
DAVID SCHNARCH "How you doing?" 

00:55:30
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. 

00:55:30
DAVID SCHNARCH Okay. And I show her that we're not gonna play with conjoint reality. And that I don't need them to agree upon it. And I'm basically saying to her, okay, your turn, come forward. 

00:55:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:55:45
DAVID SCHNARCH Let's see what you're gonna do. 

00:55:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:55:45
DAVID SCHNARCH Okay. So, she starts to say that she's very sexual. And uh, she really feels inhibited. And she feels that he inhibits her. And that she really wants to uh, uh, grow and she uh, uh, feels like he doesn't get relationships. And um, I, I forget how it comes out. I happen to ask her or she mentions it. She's never had an orgasm in her life. 

00:56:10
RICH SIMON Hmm? 

00:56:10
DAVID SCHNARCH With all this screwing around. 

00:56:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:56:15
DAVID SCHNARCH She's never had an orgasm in her life, which is a picture of a woman who is in tremendous conflict. This is not a woman whose just inhibited by her husband, this is a woman who has real conflicts about sex. What would it take to do this? I'm already thinking, okay this comes out of, this woman comes out of a house where there is something going on about sex. This, this is not a kosher house. This is something unwholesome. Does that mean there was sexual abuse, I don't know. I don't have to go that far. All I know is, is that this, this person is uh, uh, she, she's got some conflicts about sex. And then she smiles at me and she says, "I never wanted him. I never had desire." And I look at her and I said, "I, I think I heard that from your husband. There's got to be a different reason why you're telling me." "Why you telling me this?" 

00:57:10
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:57:10
DAVID SCHNARCH And she says, "I thought you ought to know." I said, you knew I knew. So you're telling me again, there's got to be a different reason why you're telling me this. 

00:57:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:57:20
DAVID SCHNARCH And she says, “Do you think I'm saying that to hurt him?" I'm saying, "At the prices you're paying if you want your words and thoughts to come out of my mouth I may be able to accommodate you." 

00:57:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:57:40
DAVID SCHNARCH Because I'm tracking that it looks like she's moving forward but she's taking a step back. She could have said, I think I'm doing it for that reason or maybe I'm doing it. She says it as, I think, David thinks. 

00:57:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:57:55
DAVID SCHNARCH That she's doing that. And she's done this very, very slick move that if I stipulate that, that's what I think she's left the room to disagree with me. She hasn't, she hasn't stipulated. And so, I said to her. 

00:58:10
RICH SIMON Oh my, this, this gets a little subtle doesn't it? 

00:58:10
DAVID SCHNARCH And so I said to her, you haven't said a single word about your house but would I be wrong if I knew you better that you come out of a house where people will screw with the truth right to your face. 

00:58:30
[sil.] 

00:58:30
DAVID SCHNARCH She said, "How do you know that?" I said, I'm not gonna talk about that with you, I asked you a question. 

00:58:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:58:35
DAVID SCHNARCH What's the answer. And she says, "Yes." And at that moment I know have a collaborative alliance with her and she is acknowledging something very, very powerful. She comes out of a very dark place and it turns out to be a very dark place. And now 20 minutes into the session I have taken uh, something that is at best collusive if not combative on her part. And she's taken a crack at her husband. And I flipped it around and now I have a collaborative alliance with her. And her husband has watched me be able to handle her. And she could just keep BS. She could just keep going but he sees she stopped. And he really believes she won't stop. And so I am co-constructing a workable couple now. So 20 minutes in, we're dealing with a different case then left to their own presentation. And when you say, oh my this is subtle. They are seeing that there is not only a lot more going on between the two of them. In very little time than they usually deal with. They like simplistic ways of looking at this. But also this is the level that we can do therapy at. And I'll say to people, I can do therapy the level of your limitations and I can do therapy at the level of your abilities, what do you want. 

01:00:10
RICH SIMON So stay with this idea of the collaborative alliance as opposed to the collusive alliance, or whatever the other contrasting. As we really, now we just have a few more minutes here. And, and so there's certainly a lot more we can talk about. But it sounds like what you've described for us, this is a point in which there's uh, there's a different direction to this. 

01:00:30
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes. 

01:00:30
RICH SIMON Therapy. So this process of you work with one, you work with the other. And so is that, that is a piece here. And with each of them, with each of them as individuals you're developing what you're calling this collaborative alliance. 

01:00:45
DAVID SCHNARCH And the collaborative alliance. 

01:00:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:00:50
DAVID SCHNARCH Between the two them. 

01:00:50
RICH SIMON And so in terms of the two of them talking together or what, what is this, this hallmark for many approaches in couples therapy. The, the couple going back and forth, just so that we can give people some flavor of where this might go. But we have a time limitation here. What part does that play working with them as a couple or as, as? So far what you describe is very much your work with each of them as, as individuals. While the other is watching. 

01:01:15
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes, but I'm not doing two sequential individual therapies. I'm making an isomorphic move. When I'm working with one, I'm working with the other. When I get the husband to stand up, that's a move I'm making on the wife. 

01:01:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:01:30
DAVID SCHNARCH When I get the wife to stand up, okay. It has an impact on the husband. And that's why the best individual therapy there is, is conjoined therapy. There is lots of good reason to have couples talk to each other as long as they talk straight. As long as they're talking good stuff. 

01:01:45
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:01:50
DAVID SCHNARCH If they're talking horse feathers. 

01:01:50
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:01:50
DAVID SCHNARCH Then they're, you know, they're validating this nonsense that they're talking with each other. 

01:01:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, uh-huh. 

01:01:55
DAVID SCHNARCH Then it's not a virtue to have them talk with each other. 

01:01:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:02:00
DAVID SCHNARCH Okay. Then I will intervene and the best way to carry the level of the intervention is between me and them. Okay. But it's not like everything goes on between the two of us. But it's like look if you two clowns are gonna talk, I don't say that way with people. 

01:02:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:02:15
DAVID SCHNARCH But if you two characters are gonna talk to each other and construct Disney World, okay. Uh, I have a hard time sitting here. Okay. Now if we label this as Disney World, I'll sit here for awhile. Or when there's, you're not doing anything productive and you're doing something destructive. You know, like, like he says I'll never do anything to hurt you. And she says I know. 

01:02:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:02:40
DAVID SCHNARCH At that point, you know, I got to say, hold it. 

01:02:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:02:40
DAVID SCHNARCH Okay. If you want to do this stuff you don't need to be paying me. You can do this stuff at home. And then I have to direct it between myself and them, okay. But you can begin to see the collusiveness in therapies where everything focuses on getting the couple to talk horse feathers to each other. 

01:03:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:03:00
DAVID SCHNARCH And if they hold each others hands or one of them cries and the other reaches out to the other then the therapist is sort of standing there like they're presiding over something holy. Okay. So often I have to say to people, particularly at the beginning of therapy could you please get rid of that hush tone in the back of your throat. Where doing therapy, we're not in church. There is nothing sacracinte(ph)(ph) happening here. 

01:03:30
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. Okay. 

01:03:30
DAVID SCHNARCH Okay. 

01:03:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)I bet when you grew up you were born in the Bronx, David, right. 

01:03:35
DAVID SCHNARCH You do get that feeling, huh. You do get that feeling. 

01:03:35
RICH SIMON Uh, so what I'm getting and, and um, it'll be hard to bring this one to a close. But the, the, let me see if I, I get, uh, try out something with you. So uh, this struck me in a number of these conversations is that really much of, of the, the ump, and so much of the direction of what people are trying to accomplish as couples therapist when uh, with couples is very much in this first session in creating uh, this um, this experience in the um, in the first session that offers an alternative. And so at the point where you have this collaborative alliance, what you're talking about that's something you're gonna keep coming back to again and again with them. You've established it, you created a culture, you've, you've created a whole set of um, the, of expectations. 

01:04:30
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes. 

01:04:30
RICH SIMON Of what this world is. And so. 

01:04:35
DAVID SCHNARCH And, and. 

01:04:35
RICH SIMON What you've described as, and certainly is not your whole therapy, but is, is, have you, have you, do you think you've communicated kind of the, in some ways it's the essence of uh, it seems to me of what you're trying to bring about. What, what's the shift? 

01:04:50
DAVID SCHNARCH Yes. And I think collaborative alliances are collaborative alliances and the rules are the same for therapist as it is for couples, and parents and children. And it's the willingness to do difficult things that need to be done for mutual benefit. And if it's tough that's tough. 

01:05:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:05:05
DAVID SCHNARCH You still do it. And you, your feelings are not important. And I have to say a lot of things, I don't feel like saying. 

01:05:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:05:10
DAVID SCHNARCH Doesn't make me feel good. I know makes me look terrible. 

01:05:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:05:15
DAVID SCHNARCH My feelings are not the important thing, results are the important thing. That's what they're paying you for. So yes, I do help people know that what I'm doing, I can enumerate through them. I'm now gonna have a collaborative alliance with them whether they like it or not. 

01:05:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:05:35
DAVID SCHNARCH Because I won't do it any other way. Responsibilities are unilateral. And they're not big enough and bad enough to make me basically not do what I love well. 

01:05:45
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:05:45
DAVID SCHNARCH And it's not just for them, it's for my own integrity. And that is why spouses and parents also keep their alliance. It's not just for the kid or the spouse. It's for their own integrity. And when you violate that with collusive alliance don't make any difference what nice words you put on it, it's still dirty. So, that's what I'm trying to get across and people love it. And what they say is, I can't get this anywhere else. 

01:06:10
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:06:15
DAVID SCHNARCH They will come in, one question that I ask all the time, even to therapist is how many of you have beat your therapist's radar and you can just bullshit to them and they don't know. 

01:06:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:06:25
DAVID SCHNARCH And it is amazing the number of therapist that will raise their hand that they have done this with their own therapist. And once that happens therapy is over. There's no trust when you can beat your therapist radar, how can you trust them. 

01:06:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

01:06:40
DAVID SCHNARCH Now. 

01:06:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:06:45
DAVID SCHNARCH The best trust there is somebody you can't get around and somebody who isn't gonna put up with your BS. And that's what you want in a spouse, that's what kid want in a parent, except when they're 17 years old. And uh, that's what clients want in a therapist. And this uh, this idea that therapist are going to offer trust, okay. The trouble is a lot of people who go onto the field are not trustworthy. They just wanna sit on the other side of the couch and empathize. And I think if you really care about your clients you stop worrying how you look and you roll up your sleeves and you help people confront the muck in their lives. 

01:07:30
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

01:07:30
DAVID SCHNARCH And move on. Cuz the goal is to get people out of therapy. Not because they terminate prematurely but because you get the job done. 

01:07:40
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:07:40
DAVID SCHNARCH The goal is to be somebody's last therapist. 

01:07:40
RICH SIMON That's well put. So we're really at, out of time. What uh, this, what an interesting conversation. And again, let me just remind uh, folks as I do at the end of each of these sessions this is the beginning not the end of the conversation. And David in particular, in his participation in other Webcasts has uh, really welcomed the responding to whatever people have to say. Whatever you toss this guys way, he'll hit it back to you. So, uh, you'll see on your screen a comment board. Uh, please, you have questions, you have comments, you have insights, you have whatever reaction you have. If there's one uh, person in the field more than, quite interested in hearing and willing uh, if it, if it, if, if he is so moved to respond is this fellow over here. So really invite you to make use of this comment board. David before we go uh, people who are interested in following up, finding out more about training possibility and other kinds of resources available to you uh, from you what is it uh, can you give us some information. 

01:08:50
DAVID SCHNARCH Absolutely. Uh, we run a website for uh, the general public called cruiseable4points.com, it's the number four, cruiseable4points.com 

01:09:00
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:09:00
DAVID SCHNARCH Is for the general public, we also list our training programs there. We're actually just about to release a new website uh, because our cruisable differentiation scale was just published by uh, Journal of Marriage and Family Therapy, pilot tested on over 5,000 people. 

01:09:15
