SANDY WILLIAMS Hi Stella. Um, how 'bout you tell me the story, um, about what's [00:00:30 bought you here? 

00:00:25
STELLA Well, I don't really want to be here, to be honest. If it was up to me I wouldn't be here. My husband has sent me here because he thinks I've got a problem with alcohol. I don't have a problem with alcohol . . . 

00:00:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:00:40
STELLA . . .(crosstalk) I have a problem with my husband. 

00:00:40
SANDY WILLIAMS If I could just stop you for a moment, um, one thing that I was going to tell you, um, before we actually started was that, um, we have a policy in this agency where, we, we warn people about confidentiality, and that is that anything that you tell me here will be confidential between us . . . 

00:00:55
STELLA Okay. 

00:00:55
SANDY WILLIAMS . . .unless, um, I feel that you're at risk or someone else is, is at risk because of, of any actions on your part. Um, so, um, if there is anything that you feel, um, you don't, that you think I might find serious enough to tell somebody else, then you need to think a little bit about telling me about that. Okay? Um, but that's probably not the case with you, so how 'bout you tell me your story now, hmm? 

00:01:25
STELLA Yeah, well my husband told me to come here, because well he basically gave me an ultimatum and said I have to come here . . . 

00:01:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:01:30
STELLA . . . because he, I, had an accident in my car at the front of our house; ran into the letterbox. 

00:01:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Oh. 

00:01:40
STELLA I had been drinking when I was driving. I have been caught drink driving before he said if I get caught drink driving again he would leave me. He said if I don't come and see you, he will leave me. He's angry at me because I will drink in front of the children and I will come home drunk. Um, I would have alcohol in the house. And I just think that for me that's what I need because my life is so stressful. 

00:02:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:02:05
STELLA I don't think I have a problem with alcohol, I think I have problems in my life and that's the way I cope. 

00:02:10
SANDY WILLIAMS I guess it's pretty hard not to think about some of those things suggesting that maybe there is a bit more of a problem than, than you might like to think you have at the moment. Driving into a letterbox, um, you're judgment sounds like it was a bit impaired. 

00:02:25
STELLA Yeah, well, so would yours be if you had, if you were in my situation. I'll bet, do you, do you drink? 

00:02:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Well, it's, this isn't about me, this is, this is a conversation about you, so I think if we keep the spotlight on you that's going to be most helpful. 

00:02:40
STELLA I guess what I'm trying to say is that I drink, but I don't really think it is any more or less than anybody else, except that maybe at times because my husband and my family stresses me out, I drink a bit more. 

00:02:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Well, it does sound like, like its crept up beyond, um, what would be a wise kind of pattern of use, I think, and it's going to be important that we look at that together and help you (inaudible), um, it may even be important for you to think about, um, giving up all together for a while if it's reached . . . 

00:03:15
STELLA (laughing) 

00:03:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Well, you know it might be outrageous kind of idea at this stage of the game, but, um, I would encourage you to think about this pretty seriously. If you've got children, um . . . 

00:03:25
STELLA I knew that this was gonna . . . 

00:03:25
SANDY WILLIAMS . . .and a husband whose threatening you, then this is the, the stakes are pretty high here. 

00:03:30
STELLA I just knew that this was going to happen. That somebody would just like try to tell me to stop drinking. There's no way I'm gonna be able to jus-, there's no way I want to stop drinking, let alone be able to stop drinking. 

00:03:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Well, I can certainly help you with the, the, the able bit. There are very helpful strategies that, that lots of people have found have helped them, um, to get back on track. Um, whether you want to give up or not, I guess, has got to do with these stakes being pretty high and, uh, this looks like to me you stand to lose a lot unless you do decide. 

00:04:00
STELLA He can leave me, honestly. I mean what, what does he do for me? I mean, he goes to work, he's never there. I have to look after the children. He's m- . . . 

00:04:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Well, the children, if you, um, pardon me for interrupting you. I think the children are really a critical issue here, you know, whether you stay with your husband or not, those children are your children and they are clearly being affected by this. It would be very difficult for, for us to say that they weren't being affected. 

00:04:30
STELLA How, how do you know that they're being affected by this? 

00:04:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Didn't you, didn't you say that you, you drink in front of them? 

00:04:35
STELLA Yeah. 

00:04:35
SANDY WILLIAMS That you get drunk in front of them? 

00:04:40
STELLA Well, if I drink too much. 

00:04:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:04:40
STELLA But . . . 

00:04:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Is that something that you think is good for your children? 

00:04:45
STELLA Well, I don't think they, they'd know, they notice. I mean they, they're pretty young. 

00:04:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. Well, I, it's not, it's important that we don't get into an argument about this. we've got a long road ahead of us in which, you know, I'm hopeful that I can help you, um, make a decision that's gonna be in your best interest. So, um, how 'bout we go back and I start to get a really detailed history about when your drinking moved from being, you know, just kind of casual and, and where you were well in charge to the way you've gotten really out of control with it. 

00:05:20

00:05:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Hello, Stella. Now, I'd, I'd like you to tell me what's bought you here, um, I just, I can see you taking a breath there, but I would like to just say a little bit about, um, confidentiality before we start because some people can feel quite vulnerable telling their story and I don't want you to, to worry about things that you might tell me. Okay? Um, what happens between you and me here is going to be absolutely confidential; no one else is going to know about this unless either of us felt really worried about your safety or someone else's safety. Okay? So how 'bout you tell me what's bought you here. 

00:06:05
STELLA Well, to be honest, I don't really want to be here, it's my husband that wanted me to come here. He gave me an ultimatum and said that if I don't come to see somebody that he will leave me. 

00:06:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Oh. 

00:06:15
STELLA And I'm starting to think well, let him leave me, you know. I don't really want to be here. He thinks I've got a problem with drinking. 

00:06:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:06:20
STELLA I don't think I've got a problem with drinking, I think I've got a problem with him. 

00:06:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, okay. So, you're a bit reluctant about sitting in this chair having a conversation with me? 

00:06:30
STELLA Yeah, I just think it's a waste of time. Like it's not, that's not my problem, you know. The other things in my life are a problem, he can help me with those other things . . . 

00:06:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:06:35
STELLA . . . but he chooses to try to palm (ph) me off. 

00:06:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So, he's kind of lost about what to do with this, he's worried, clearly worried. Um, and something in you, um, has, has decided to come here despite your resistance. What, what's that about? 

00:06:55
STELLA Well, I think that really, honestly it's him. 

00:06:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Oh. 

00:07:00
STELLA Like I, I guess, I guess I don't want him to leave. 

00:07:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm, OK. So, there's something about this man, you still want him in your life, and do you have children? 

00:07:10
STELLA Mm-hmm. 

00:07:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:07:10
STELLA Two. 

00:07:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So, there's, there's a lot at stake if you were to split up. 

00:07:15
STELLA Mm-hmm. 

00:07:15
SANDY WILLIAMS So, it sounds like despite the fact that you, you see things differently than him, um, despite the fact that this is not where you want to be, um, part of you wants to, to make sure that your family stays together. 

00:07:30
STELLA Yeah 

00:07:30
SANDY WILLIAMS And it sounds like it's been more of a misunderstanding or, or your picture thing is very different than his. 

00:07:40
STELLA Totally. 

00:07:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, Yeah. 

00:07:40
STELLA I try to talk to him, but you know, it's like talking to a brick wall. Um, it's gotten to the point where I can't be bothered talking to him anymore. 

00:07:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm. 

00:07:45
STELLA It's like banging my head against a wall. 

00:07:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. Um, let, let me just flag at this point that it, it sounds like it might be a good idea at some point to involve David in, in this. It might be that I can talk to him and help him get a handle on a different, different aspect, a different picture of this, as well, so I just want to flag that as a possibility. 

00:08:10
STELLA He might, I mean he certainly doesn't listen to me. I don't know if he would listen to you, but . . . 

00:08:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So you're both really at kind of logger heads? 

00:08:20
STELLA Mm-hmm. 

00:08:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Um, could you, um, maybe just tell, give me a little bit of a picture about what, what your alcohol use is? 

00:08:30
STELLA Well . . . 

00:08:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Why he might think that there is a bit of an issue here. 

00:08:30
STELLA Well, the reason that he's told me to come here this time is because I drove home; I went for drinks with some friends and I drove home, I was, I wasn't really drunk, but I was probably too drunk to be driving. 

00:08:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:08:45
STELLA And I hit the letterbox . . . 

00:08:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:08:50
STELLA . . .and I pranged our car . . . 

00:08:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Oh, dear. 

00:08:50
STELLA . . .against the letterbox, it's a brick letterbox, and, um, I have had one, you know, charge. 

00:09:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:09:00
STELLA I lost my license about six years ago for drunk driving. . . 

00:09:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:09:05
STELLA . . . and he basically said, look you have to clean up your act cause if you lose your license again, that's it. You know, and if you don't come here, that's it. 

00:09:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm. 

00:09:15
STELLA He says that, you know, I'm a bad mother because I drink in front of the kids . . 

00:09:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Mm-hmm. 

00:09:15
STELLA . . . and that I'll come home drunk. 

00:09:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. 

00:09:20
STELLA He says that I'm a bad mother. But at least I'm there for them, you know. 

00:09:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:09:25
STELLA I might, I might be drunk but at least I'm there for them, not like him. 

00:09:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right, he's away a lot . . . 

00:09:30
STELLA Yeah, he's . . . 

00:09:30
SANDY WILLIAMS . . . or not around or what? 

00:09:30
STELLA He works and he works late and then he goes away and, you know, he wanted to have the kids and he acts like they're my kids, that they're not his kids. 

00:09:35
SANDY WILLIAMS OH. So things have gotten quite a tangle, haven't they? 

00:09:40
STELLA Mmm. 

00:09:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Mmm. A lot of crossed wires. Mmm. Okay. 

00:09:45
STELLA Everything's my fault, you know, nothings ever his fault. But, drinking is just the way I cope. It's just the way I cope with the fact that I feel like, I've, I've, I've taken on more than I can chew. 

00:10:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm, and how man-, you said you had two, two kids? 

00:10:00
STELLA Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. 

00:10:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, and he's away a lot? 

00:10:05
STELLA Mm-hmm. 

00:10:05
SANDY WILLIAMS So thats . . . 

00:10:05
STELLA He doesn't do anything. 

00:10:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay and you found that drinking has, has helped a little bit take, take the rough edges off things . . . 

00:10:10
STELLA Mm-hmm. 

00:10:15
SANDY WILLIAMS . . .and help you keep afloat. 

00:10:15
STELLA Yep. 

00:10:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah, Yeah. 

00:10:15
STELLA If I didn't, If I didn't go out drinking with my friends I'd have nothing in my life that was enjoyable. 

00:10:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. But it also sounds like, um, unless something shifts, um, between the two of you that the relationship is really at a critical stage. Hmm? 

00:10:35
STELLA Yeah. 

00:10:35
SANDY WILLIAMS And that there's some part of you that doesn't want the relationship to finish; wants to keep the family together. 

00:10:40
STELLA Yeah, 'cuz at least if, you know, he's never there, but at least I've got a husband. I mean, I can't imagine how I'd cope with the kids without him . . . 

00:10:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:10:50
STELLA . . .at all. 

00:10:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Well, I'd, I'd like us to be able to, without there being any agenda here on my part, on your part about, what you're gonna do about your alcohol abuse, whatever it is. I'd like us to be able to take some time to unravel things a bit and in particular look at what stresses you're under and, and whether there are any other ways that you might be able to cope with some of those stresses and, and maybe cut back a little bit on your alcohol use. I don't know there, there, there's a poss-, there's possibly some strategies, some, a range of options that you haven't, um, been able to entertain. You know, you've just had your head down trying to cope. 

00:11:30
STELLA Mm-hmm. 

00:11:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Maybe there are some things we can do together that feel, that you feel that you could try. 

00:11:35
STELLA Mm-hmm. 

00:11:35
SANDY WILLIAMS So that we have a bit of an open book at this stage, hmm?
