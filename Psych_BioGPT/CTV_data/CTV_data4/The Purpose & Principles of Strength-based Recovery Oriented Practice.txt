The Purpose & Principles of Strength-based Recovery Oriented Practice 

00:00:05
THOM PANCELLA Hello and welcome to this MIMHtraining.com presentation on The Purposes, Principles and Functions of the Strength-Based, Person-Centered Approach to Community Mental Health. My name is Thom Pancella with the Missouri Institute of Mental Health. Thanks for taking the time to take this training program. We're joined by Dr. Walter Kisthardt. And Dr. Kisthardt has been involved in the research dissemination and training of A Strengths Model of Case Management for at least 25 years. He has worked with state policy makers and direct service providers in 43 states, in England, and New Zealand. Dr. Kisthardt has provided training and technical assistance to-- in Missouri here-- with several mental health programs and provided statewide training in Missouri's Futures program. He has also consulted with the Division of Children's Services in Jackson County, and has provided training, technical assistance, and researched the impact of strength-based case management with the homeless in the greater Kansas City area. Currently, he is providing training for substance abuse counselors, mental health therapists, case managers, and community corrections officers in Kansas who work with people who struggle with co-occurring disorders. Dr. Kisthardt is a Chair and BSW Program Director at Park University. And, ah, Wally, thank you for joining us today. 

00:01:10
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT It's my pleasure, Thom. It's great to be here. 

00:01:15
THOM PANCELLA Let's start with some background. 

00:01:15
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT You read that's just the way my mother wrote it, by the way. 

00:01:15
THOM PANCELLA Oh, well, she's good. She's good. She needs to put some, some smaller silverwares in here, though. 

00:01:20
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT Yeah. 

00:01:25
THOM PANCELLA Give us some history. Give us a little bit of a background. 

00:01:25
Dr. Walter Kisthardt, PhD 

00:01:25
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT Well, it's safe to say it's interesting. Ah, back in 1985 my colleagues and I at the University of Kansas, that's called Social Welfare received an MIMH grant to develop a model of case management. Back then as you know case mana-- management was just emerging as a, ah, a methodology that we thought would be really important for adult with persistent mental illness to make it in the community. And so, we put together this model with this MIMH funding that we called the Developmental Resource Acquisition Model. Now that's a mouthful, right? So we got to looking at this approach and we thought, "What really is unique about our approach versus what the people in Wisconsin had done, ah, with the packed program, what the people of Boston had done with psych rehab?" A lot of integrating things but there are some things that were different about, about our approach and one of the things that we concluded was that what we do is we have a focus on strengths on what the person already can do, on their interest, on their capacities. Whereas some people are doing a functional assessment to, you know, to kind of balance, you know, get the deficits so that we can do a, a rehabilitation kind of approach. We were really looking at what the person could already do. And moving away from what we would know as a need assessment to a wants assessment. Now that counts-- that sounds kind of strange, doesn't it? Wants-- is, is the wants assessment, ah, develop it? What? It's the need assessment. Oh well, that falls right after your tongue. And so, we, we began to develop this approach and interestingly enough we wrote an article, it's a very good resource for anyone who's interested in this, ah, it's in Social Work Journal and I believe the year is 1988 and that's called The Strengths Perspective in Social Work Practice and it was written by myself, Ann Weick, ah, Charles Rapp and Pat Sullivan. And when that first appeared in the Social Work Journal people had said, you know, they, they were, they were, ah, people who were moving kind of in this direction. That's the first time that metaphor if you will had been used in the professional, professional literature in terms of social. A straight perspective which moved us away from problems orientation or the problem solving model. So basically what's happened with the approach since then it's, it's been replicated here in Missouri in several programs in, in many other states and as we evaluate it and as we look at the impact we've had some pretty encouraging outcomes in terms of the level of engagement that kind of precipitates with the service participant that was involved because it really does put them in the driver seat, if you will. We are asking people what it is that you want? Now that may sounds right but as I commented this morning in the, in the keynote it's a little-- it-- if we'll gonna move in this direction, if I'm gonna ask someone for example who's in, uhm, a residential facility or group home, what is it you want? Then the person says, I want out of here, right? Where do we go with that? So it's a kind of a dangerous, right? So we say, well, you're not ready and the person might come back and say, why did you even ask me? And so, it sounds almost simplistic but it's not. Ah, there's a whole range of philosophies and principles and conventional practice wisdom that really do need to, to be modified if we're going to, to work with people in this way. Ah, so that's basically a little bit of a history, ah, of, of the strengths approach. Since that time it's been replicated with, ah, again with adulthood persistent mental illness, with the homeless, the Futures program was very successful. What we did was we, we trained income maintenance workers in Missouri who wanted to work as case managers in-- with the-- we actually predated TANF in Missouri. So we were on the cast. Ah, and so, people began to use the strengths model with primarily single parents and we have 42,000 people I believe it was at the first couple of years getting off the welfare rolls. Ah, President Clinton came to Kansas city and I can't remember the year '96, '96 to congratulate, ah, Jackson County, the state of Missouri on what it had done with the, the Futures programs. So that's pretty exciting. So it-- it's such a humanistic approach that it's been replicated with a lot of populations. 

00:06:00
THOM PANCELLA You mentioned earlier that the conventional wisdom. I think a lot of people kind of cut their teeth under the biological and medical model. 

00:06:05
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT Yes. 

00:06:05
THOM PANCELLA Uhm, how does that integrated on what you do? 

00:06:05
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT That's a great question. When we first start doing the training as you know with any paradigm shift there some plates that clash. And as we were talking about shifting from a preoccupation with symptoms, - 

00:06:20
THOM PANCELLA Uhm-mm. 

00:06:20
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT - to a preoccupation with the person, you know, and, and people were wanting to put those into camps. They wanted to make it either more. So, okay, so therefore, if I integrate the strengths perspective that de facto means I am doing away with the medical model like it's one or the other and that's not what we were saying but that's the way some people heard it. Your point in right on what, what people have come to see is that when you use a strengths perspective you still need to understand the aspects of human biology, cognitive theory, behavioral theory, cultural theory, theological theory, the spirituality is so important to people as we're now really starting to, to get to, to know. But the point is all of the, the biological theory if you will or, or medical model is subsumed with an overarching strengths perspective. So for example, if I am-- if you were working with me and your-- information that you have on me when I'm coming the center is that if co-occurring disorder, he has mental illness, he has primary diagnosed, he has substance abuse problems as well. So you have all of this information and I come in and I say, no, I, I don't have a mental illness. And I can handle the drinking. Where do you go? You either say, well, thanks for coming in. I don't think I can work with you. You're in denial. Or, you say, I, I understand how you're constructing your reality right now. The way I work with people is, I don't focus on the problems right away anyway. I want to get to know you. So where you living now? What do you like about where you live in? Do you want to keep living there? What is it that you like to have happen in your life that isn't happening now? And we focus on that. As the person starts working on us and, and this is a-- an actual example from Maricopa County in Phoenix, we've done some work out there. Case manager shifted the focus with this individual because they're-- the focus on the problem was not working. He was quote unquote, resistive, oppositional, all those interesting terms. And said to him, okay look, how about if I meet with you at 11 o'clock on Monday, Monday morning and we'll start developing the strengths assessment. I'll talk a little bit more about that later, I'll talk about that tomorrow as well. Ah, and, and we can kind of start talking about resources we can use because you said you want you-- you're homeless now and you wanna have your own place. Great. Case manager said to him, now at 11 o'clock when you show up I'm gonna be sober. You're a partner in this process. I expect you to be as well. Made the plan when they meet. This serve as participant show up at 11 and he's sober. Now some of the people said that's the first time he had, had a drink before 11 o'clock. Now there was an incentive for him to do that. In any event, the case manager didn't focus on the drinking. Didn't focus on the medication non-compliance. That's an important issue. Help him to get the apartment. Once he got the apartment, the case manager, do you want to keep the apartment? Yeah. All right, then I think you need to look at how you're taking your medications and how you're drinking. And then he's starting to look at that because now he had something that meant something to him. Now he had something that he don't want to lose whereas before he's taking medication, ah, and not drinking was out of context. It wasn't tied to any pay off for him, if you will. And that's how they become integrated. Most people there's data that suggest that if you look at the American public we, we deal with the issue of non-compliance, right? And that's a big issue. The, the American public generally, the medication non-compliance rate is about 84%. Now, where do we get that from? We get that from people who go to their physician and they say, Thom, you have an ear infection. Uhm, I'm gonna prescribe amoxicillin. It's an antibiotic. I want you to take it till it's all gone. I'm not gonna ask you if you ever stopped before, I did but when I asked that question in the large room many other hands got. That's non-compliance, okay. Then, you say, well, how many of you have-- if I would do a home visit and with your permission check your medication cabinet and I find medication in there that says, do not use after June 12th 2006. I think, yeah, yeah, okay. Medication non-compliance. Did you ever drive your car after you took a medication that says, do not operate heavy machines? Non-compliance. That's where they got this statement. The point is, most people would rather not take their medications. We have got to help people understand why taking your medications is important for you, how it helps you to get and keep the things that are meaningful for you and I think when we think about why any of us take medication that's probably there for us. We know there is a, a payoff, okay. And the payoff is not simply the act of taking your medication. The payoff is what it helps me to do. I can do my job. I can breathe, you know. Ah, I cannot have so much pain as I have after a softball game whatever happens to be, right. So that's an excellent question and, and some people struggled with how, how those views become integrated. When you're working with the whole person there's no way you can ignore the biological and neurological. But we're also learning the bio-neurological is very much affected by the environmental. And so, to favor one over the other, to favor internal bio-neurological process over social conditions like poverty and discrimination and nobody will hire me and I'm lonely and I am troubled with relationships and all of these, to favor one of those over the other is an injustice. They're both very, very important in a person's being, right? And so that's how would be a, a brief explanation or discussion. It's a great question. You can write a whole paper on it. 

00:13:00
THOM PANCELLA Let's look at how mental health treatment is done now and substance abuse interventions are done now and, and bring your model and play there. 

00:13:10
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT What's happening is that we're learning that we, we need to-- and part of this is being driven of course by the economy and by dollars for mental health and substance abuse care. We know they're limited. But, you know, there was a-- I'm thinking of a very wise policy analyst. Several years ago, he's name is David Mechanic and he said, this is pretty close to a direct quote, well, we don't need new money in community mental health to be affected. He said, we're not gonna get it anyway. What we need to do is use the money that we have more efficiently. And I thought that was a really very much spot on observation. What are we utilizing our dollars for? What are we buying? What are we doing? And the notion now of, of that we're actually paying for services it's not sustainable. Because what we need to be doing is paying for outcomes and certainly we're gonna be providing services. But I think the way the services are beginning to look now it's a little more like a generalist model of practice, if you will, as oppose to a specialist. A generalist approach, I think the reason-- one of the reasons why we have case management is that and I, and I was there years ago when I was a therapist is that when advocacy is involved, for example, with a landlord, often the therapist even if they want to won't do that. Why? Because it's not clinical. It's not available. So if I'm the director of that agency I'm not gonna have you out there doing advocacy. Whereas, if you would do that you know the person better than anybody probably now the case managers involved, if you would do that that's probably the most effective use of your time by you meeting with that landlord, mediating a plan, helping to leave the anxiety around this-- at this person's experiencing because they, they possibly gonna lose their apartment. That would be an effective intervention, okay? And it would be cost-effective. You'd be happy. The person would be happy. We, we need to think about, about how we're configuring our services, means and ends. Therapy, case management, medication, right, group. In addictions, we love the groups. You know, you have the working groups. So that's fine. Some people don't work as well in a groups. So what we're trying to do in Kansas is get councilors to broaden their, ah, inter-- interventive repertoire, if you will, right? And say, gee, I can actually work with one person. Doesn't have to be a whole group cuz their plans like you got to go to five groups a week and things like that. And I can actually go out in the community with Thom and I can actually do advocacy. Now what we're doing in Kansas with that is once the therapist are trained to do the person-centered case management they actually now can built through medi-- for case management they couldn't before. That would be at the clinic, that'd be at the program, right, do in the group. So what's happening in practice now I think is a more kind of a push to have mental health providers to view themselves really as more generalist or willing and able to effect-- to try to do policy interventions to do advocacy which we could talk about at the center but usually that's not is, ah, as effective. It's actually being out there and, and, and doing the networking, you know, and, and working with people like landlords and employers. Two factors related to recovery that the research is clear on, ah, is that people have a home, not just housing, right? A home where they have the remote kind of a deal, right? A home they can play the guitar at 3 o'clock in the morning if they like to. They have a home and they have meaningful activity, a job. They have a job. They, they have a meaningful kind of volunteer position that they go to and it mean something to them and they're out of their role of patient or client and that kind of thing. And so, another way practice I think is changing is we're asking people to be out in the community more, out of the office, ah, because you can get so much done in terms of meeting people where they are. The no show rate in mental health I don't know what it is specifically in Missouri but around the country people who don't show up for their therapy appointments or group is relatively high. I've seen 50-- 51% that people don't show up. The data that we have on-- when you ask-- you negotiate kind of where the meeting will be with the person, okay. And they say I'd rather meet out in the community somewhere and we do that, that significantly impacts, ah, that no show rate. People show up. Now, what happens is it ex-- it challenges people because it's expanding the traditional boundaries of the helping relationship. Used to be a lot safer, all right? Thom your appointments at one. We'll meet in my office. We'll meet for about 50 minutes. Talk about somethings, uhm, pretty, pretty structure. I'm not gonna, ah, say a whole a lot about me. I ask the questions. You'll, you'll to-- talking kind of bit. Kinda safe, kind of circumscribed and now it's a little more messy, a little more messy because we're out there with people and we're actually trying to use ourselves as conduits for community integration. Oh, that sounds great. What does that mean? That means if I'm working with the person with persistent mental illness and one of the goals they have is to go and see a movie but they're really afraid and they're comfortable with me and they would go if I went with them. That means if we put that on their plan or out in the open I will accom-- I used to do that when I work with people with phobias only it was the medical model. 

00:19:20
THOM PANCELLA Uhm-mm. 

00:19:20
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT I didn't call it going to a movie with someone, I call it systematic desensitization and successive approximation. 

00:19:25
THOM PANCELLA Exposure. 

00:19:25
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT Yes. Exactly, exactly. So that's what that means. Now, I'll talk tomorrow about a concept that I developed in, in my research in writing that was a response to the notion of termination. I was never wild about that term because termination was oppose to start like in the beginning of the helping process. I know I didn't do it. I was trying to do therapeutic alliance and then, you know, all this and I, I wasn't really doing termination. But I found that really effective case managers at the first meeting, second meeting while they were consciously trying to engage with someone and build a relationship they were asking questions around potential resources, family, friends that they could draw upon so that they could replace themselves in a specific helping activity with the naturally occurring resource. As a therapist, I never did that. I was gonna meet with you one time and then at the end of that session say, well, Thom, I hope it went well today. I believe in graduated disengagement. So, hope we can have sitting here next week. That would be, you know, right, antithetical but that notion of expanding the person social network disengaging but there's an elasticity to re-- to relationship because if you get in crisis we have the relation. I may reengage and now the number of visits are based on your situation it's not based on some, some score that I've done that tells me how intensive your services need to be. Your condition, your situation dictates how intensive the services should be. And, and so, so it's kind about a lot of different kind of ways that practices expanding people who are in day programs I would challenge them like we did today we talk a little bit about how is what you're doing preparing this person to achieve an outcome that they have stated they want it. So I want my own place and people are supposed to be working with me on that I'm coming to the state program, how specifically is what I'm doing here moving me that much closer to getting my own place, okay? And it pushes all of us, you know. The other thing that this practice approach does is it really, it really does put a level of accountability on the participant and as I noted today I think language is important, I call people who receive our care now service participants not patients, not clients, not consumers, okay. There are certain elements of those that are fine, there are certain elements of those that put the person in a very different situation. I find the notion of service participant helpful because it, it-- it's a very active word. It-- it's a word that conveys an expectation. You're expected to participate as a partner, as the directing partner in this situation. So because the last message that we want to send to people in our work is that number one it's gonna be business, as usual. I'm gonna focus on your problems. Uhm, we really don't have a lot of expectations cuz your prognosis is poor. Ah, it's gonna take a long time for you when you work up to anything like-- as opposed to, I know things will be difficult but there are things you want and you have some amazing gifts. We're gonna try to put the resources around you and build a plan where you incrementally work towards that who knows how you can go. It's a very different approach. Ah, oh, but you're setting the person up for failure, right? Now, hear that. I'm, I'm affirming what the person said their dream is and I'm working with them to break that down into incremental steps where they experience success and then let's see where they can go. If they don't go as far as they said they wanted to at least they tried and that's their right, okay, so. 

00:23:20
THOM PANCELLA Let's start talking about some of the challenges of, of integrating this approach into our current systems. 

00:23:25
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT Very good. Well, the first thing we need to look at is what are the specific behaviors in the current system that we're doing because they're reimbursable and because they're expected by the funder. So that-- that's, that's one issue. So for example, in this model one of the ways that it is expressed concretely is in ha-- ah, engaging the participant in developing their own strength assessment, yeah. And the strength assessment is a different notion from traditional psychiatric assessments where we're asking questions and we're formulating our impressions of what's going on. The strength assessment is actually developed and know that I say develop not completed, right, cuz it's never done, it's developed by the person we're working with. So after we talk with them I might show them the strengths assessment. So, you know, Thom, the questions I'd been asking you today to try to get to know you because it's very important because you're different from everybody I'm working with. The questions I'd been asking you are on this tool we call strengths assessment. Would you like to see it? Most people are very curious about that. People are curious about the paperwork so we, we share that with them. The questions are right on that tool. So we have questions in, in one of seven life domains I believe it is and the first one is the sense of home. So where are you currently living? That question might be on-- the person's encourage actually take their time, actually take this tool with them back to their apartment, to the group home. I've actually done this in psychiatric hospitals where I work with the person the first day they took this tool back to their ward and then they came back the next day Thom you would been blown away by how much this one particular guy put on it. He has done it so alarming. People when they have a chance to share information in that medium as oppose to looking at someone then having to think in, in get something out. It's remarkable. I'm doing research now I have a stack of strength assessments about this high. And some of the things that people put in there, incredible, in terms of important information. If the person is enable to write then the case manager or therapist could sit and work, you know, on that with them telling them the question. But the idea is it drives them right in. The information is in their words, their perspective and it focuses on what the person wants not needs. It's not a need assessment. That's very different. It's, it's a wants assessment. And if the person just says, well, I'm living with my parents now. Let's say they are 27 years old, maybe the stuff thinks it's time for them to individuate, you see, and move out, you're an adult. But I kinda like it here. What do you like about living here is one of the other question. My mom is a good cook. I have my own room. I have a big screen TV. I can sleep till ten. You know, you start to get think, that's not a bad gig, you know? And we want them to move? Hello. You know, mom is happy because her son is here. Hello, that's symbiotic. Well, that's from your point of view it's symbiotic. You know, it's like we really need to be careful of our interjecting our value judgments on people on their situations. The point is, the person says, right now I want to stay right here. They wrote that in here. All right. We'll try to help you do that. Now if I look at that and say, you know, that's counter indicated. I think you should (inaudible ) right from the get-go. It's a bell. I don't want that. I wanna build my capacity and influence them because I was talking about it down the road but for now that's where they want to stay. Now, if mom is upset with something and is thinking about kicking him out. They're upset about, about their behavior so not thinking about kicking them out yet. But we become aware of that, then we say now, do you, do you really wanna stay here? Yeah. Well, your mom is really accep-- she expects some behavior from you that is different from what you're doing. If you really want to stay here you need to look at that behavior and we need to kinda meet with her and work that out. If the person doesn't want, you know, doesn't wanna leave then they're more willing to do that, ah, do, do what's expected up. So it's, it's that, that, that, that influence. If we don't have that information it's really hard to use those things as a catalyst for the person to make different decisions, okay. And that's what this approach is about. It's not about getting the person to change necessarily, okay. Because they may not want to change and sometimes I don't wanna change. But I'm still gonna make decisions tomorrow. If you can help me, you know, make decisions that are healthier for me and that are healthier for the people around me then I think I've done a good job. I still the way-- I still perceive that I haven't change. I'm still doing my thing. But I'm making different decisions. See, there's a nuance there. It's not just semantics, okay. And so, ah, so that strengths assessment I think is a really important difference. Now the agencies need to look at their policies some of the agencies that have done training with they say that's fine but that needs that document needs to stay here. That's part of the medical file. And I say, you won't see the diagnosis anywhere on that, on that, on that instrument. It's not about their diagnosis. It's not about their problems. It's not about their symptoms. That's like a, a life kind of inventory for them, for them to work on and if they want to have that with them and they sign up and they put that on their goals I have a copy of my strength assessment that I'm working on there shouldn't be a problem with that. But some agencies get a little reluctant with-- again the expanded boundaries that this, that this approach, ah, requires. The person awareness and recovery plan are another concrete expression of, of, of practice. If you look at a treatment plan, a conventional treatment plan they have presenting problem, they have needs, they have maybe five axis, they have the addictions severity induction or whatever it looks like, okay. All of that. And what I challenge people to do sometimes when I'm consulting, you know, doing training at, at an agency is I'll say, okay, I have a, a little exercise for you. Just go back to the agency and go back to that room where it says, stuff only, okay, where the charts are. And pick out five of the charts at random. Cover the name. Go to the intake, the diagnostic and the treatment plan and see if you can tell who's chart you have. If you can, nice. If you can't, then something is going on. These are all-- they all look the same. They all look the same. That's not an individualized plan. My, my contention with them is that's actually a waste of time because you're writing the same thing for everybody. Yes, but we have to then we need to look at what is expected from the funders. Sometimes the level of, of disempowerment from the providers is incredible, you know, in terms of, you know, part of what we do is effect policy. Part of what we do we're expected to inform funders and policy, ah, makers that the way we have the policy now is actually, is actually influencing practice that's not as effective as it could be. Because you won't be able for me to be out, ah, out of the office and that's what the research suggest, it's one of the best ways to engage with people. Uhm, you won't-- you won't use the strength assessment because we see that as more work but it's not really more work because the participants don't like it, you know, that kind of thing. And so, the person awareness and recovery plan what some agencies have done is they've kept the master treatment plan in place cuz you know the way that is. Once that's in place you can't take that out of context to get that out of there. And they have made the person awareness and recovery plan in addendum to it and it's much more individualized, it has the person's motivational goal in their words at the top, it has three to six months concrete goal that we're working towards and then it has the short-term goals or tasks with target dates that are the indicators of how this person is moving ahead. What I like to say is and I especially like to say this in Missouri, right, is that when you use this approach you don't need to determine where someone is in term-- you don't need to make the determination of where someone is in term-- in terms of a-- for example stage of change. You don't need to determine that. What do you mean? Their behavior will show you. That's what I like doing this training in Missouri. That's your mistake, right? I expect you to do this. We talked about it. You, you said these were really important. You know, updating your resume was an important thing to do as a first step to your dream of getting through college and getting a job. So we're breaking it down. We're gonna put a target data on here for next week when we get together Thom. And we'll review it. If you weren't able to do it that's cool, you know, but I, I really hope that you can and we're gonna start there and we're gonna leave that. So you don't-- let's say you don't do it. Okay, we're gone in away. Let me check with you. Do you still really wanna finish that degree? Are we on the right track? Yeah, yeah, but something came up. Okay, let's break it down a little more, huh, and we kinda work. The person will show you there, their pat-- their decision making patterns around the extent to which something is a priority for them, okay. And so, this approach actually is very freeing for the provider because I don't need to be Kreskin anymore. Do you remember Kreskin? I'm, I'm dating myself. Sorry folks if some of you don't remember Kreskin, ah, Kreskin had his hat and he was able to see the future and predict what someone could do and couldn't do. I'd given that up. I'll validate what they have to say, challenge them gently around what needs to happen. Let's see where it goes. I'm here with you. The team's here with you. Your family is supporting you. Let's see and see what happens and if the behavior indicates the pattern is something always comes up that's more important than rather than determining that as being non-compliant or whatever I might say to a person it seems like they are other things that are more important in your life right now. And that's cool. That's cool. And so maybe we'll come back to this. Now where can we go from here. So... 

00:34:45
THOM PANCELLA And we see we gone down a little bit to this with, ah, kind of the how, kind of what it looks like. What-- give us a little-- give a more flavor for, for what this, what is it actually looks like? 

00:35:00
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT Our first meeting is gonna hopefully be at a place where you're the most comfortable. And so it might not be at the mental health center it might not be at the program. Now this is after you're into because the intakes probably gonna happen there, all right, but you can refer for case management, you meet the criteria, some emphasis made. So what it might look like is we're both out at a basketball court some place cuz you like basketball and I do too. So we decided we meet at a basketball court not, not far from the mental health center, not far from your house. You don't have a basketball but I do. So I brought a basketball. So now we're kinda shooting around. While we're shooting around somebody say, what is he doing? What is that? A door relationship? No, no. I am engaging with the person in the community around the common interest. They feel more comfortable doing this and I'm probably gonna have more disclosure and more sharing in getting to know the person better out shooting baskets with them than I would if we were sitting in the office and you know kind of doing this. So the context looks different we might be out there. Uhm, the, the team as I said today if we're meeting to talk about the person situation we're gonna try to meet at a time when the person can join us at our treatment team meeting. That can happen all the time, all right? But there are times when it can. And my question to the team is, what-- why is the person not here? Have they been invited? Well, we can never done that before, some people said to me. I said, well, I understand that but if you're working with me and I know you all are talking about my situation and I'm right in the next room and you haven't invited me to be a part of that I'm gonna be a little hurt and maybe a little angry, ah, by that. And as I said today in the, in the address I might not go along with what you plan just I'm principal because you excluded me. Now I thought you folks, you know, believe in inclusion. So that will look different. As the team sitting around, you know, kind of talking about anything. That service participant is right there with them. I actually encourage some people let the service participant sit at the head of the table with psychiatrist usually set at our state hospital, right? Because the psychiatrist is here, I was right here, in charge nurse is there, isn't it a great word, in charge nurse? I used call that as the power triumph, you know. We are sitting with our coffee mugs and smoking and we're, we're gonna in charge all over the place. Ah, but so, so that it look different. The, the tools, the assessment kind of things that we're doing looks different. The, the strength assessment looks different from the traditional need space kind of assessment that's often done. Ah, the personal wellness and recovery plan it look different because it's more organic, it's involving, it, it flows from week to week. There's humor. There is, you know, you're, you're building, ah, joy, a sense of celebration not just in your work with the person but at the agency. The agency has a welcoming feel, ah, to it. The agency, uhm, some of the most effective community support programs in the country and this has been, you know, kind of talk about for years. When people walk in one of the first observation is I couldn't tell who was stuff and I couldn't tell who is the patients. Yeah. Because people are own up their sleeves and they don't, you know, they, they are joining people where they are. Ah, and so, now the, the, the, the piece about, about the boundaries because pe-- it's important to say something because a lot of you say that sounds great but what if they get kind of what I call abnormally interdependent on the case manager. We do it all the time and the therapist, so you know, you're dealing with it. So there's a concept I talk about call graduated disengagement I think I mentioned it. And if I'm your supervisor and your case manager and you're utilizing this approach and you have really engage with someone and you have met them at their home, and you've met them at McDonald's, you're getting to know them, you're, you're, you're getting to the point where they are actually starting to get engage with some of the programming at the center and that kind of thing. But you're, you're, you're doing-- you're like, ah, let's say meeting them at McDonald's for coffee and that kind of thing. If I'm your supervisor, I'll say, okay Thom what about graduated disengagement? And you might say, what's that? Or you might say, oh yeah. Well, I did say something to the person about that my job is really to get other people to come here to McDonald's with them and have coffee but they told me I was like sent from God and, okay, I understand Thom but we really need to focus on that now. You need to be having other people doing that because you've done, you've done a great job engaging them. But now, you're sending a message that this was what's your job is and that's really not what our job is, okay. It's that ultimate outcome of community integration where we can disengage and now they have other supports. Uhm, so, so yeah, I think kinda lot of levels it looks, it looks different in terms of the supervision as I mentioned. Uhm, if people are replicating this model they tend to do group supervision rather than individuals supervision which we typically have done, ah, supervisor four or five case managers much more efficient everybody here is about the person that kind of thing. Now for licensure even in Missouri's we're starting to get to the point where if someone is a social worker and they're doing their two years of, of supervisor work for their clinical, for their license they can do a piece of that in group supervision now from what I understand. Back a couple of years ago no, no, no. Let's be all kind of one-- so I think that's a very positive kind of thing as well. So a lot of need things happening. Ah, it's very exciting time to be in the field. I think that for people are just entering the field they're gonna see incredible transformation as we, as we move ahead for people like ourselves who'd been in the field for a while. It's been a blink of an eye since like the institutionalization, you know, '60s, '70s but already I think we have seen a kind of, ah, a, a very large shift in terms of the nature of the relationship. The expanded, ah, kind of scope of what we do with people, the focus on outcomes and I think what we're gonna see now and I hope you all are attending to this, what we're all-- what we're gonna see more of this really making sure that the caregiver is taking care of herself or himself with the same fervor that they're taking care of other people and that agencies are attending to that. That agencies just like innovative businesses realize in order to keep good people I need to send them a message. I'm concerned about your health and I'm putting things in place like flex time and things like that, that are gonna accommodate your schedule and, uhm, and, and bonuses as if when and if I can or whatever happens to be but, ah, to send that, that, uhm, to keep good people in our field I think we need to, we need to do that. And, ah, I'm looking forward to the, to the changes that are gonna happen in the next 20 years. Hopefully, we'll all still be around. 

00:42:10
THOM PANCELLA It's like to hook people up with some, some resources to as people are getting into this because I, I can, I can almost hear people saying to out there, uhm, that sounds great but how do I get, you know, here I am at the bottom of the food chain, how do I get up, up the line and... 

00:42:25
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT Uhm-mm. That's a great question. Well, for, for any, anyone who's interested you can certainly contact me, ah, it's wkisthardt@park.edu and I will send, will send copies of strength assessment. I have a whole bunch of things that I've written, ah, some are in publication, some are in books like the Strengths Perspective and Social Work Practice by my colleague, ah, Dennis Saleebey who edited that. We have a book, ah, the Strengths Model of Case Management, ah, my colleague Charles Rapp authored that. A lot of my works in there. Uhm, and so they can get in touch with me I can-- I think, uhm, I can get them publications. I can send them the tools. Very often what we found is that the frontline providers and the supervisors when they implement some of these approach they at least kind of permission to, okay, nothing we've, nothing we've done with Mark has, has work. Go ahead, keep me post, let me see how he does with the strength assessment and personal wellness plan and recovery plan, that kind of thing. What often happens is the change come from the bottom up. Best practice usually comes from the bottom up and that's what changes the policy. So I encourage everyone out there to-- if you're interested, ah, get into that competencies that we social workers called the researcher practitioner. It's one of the ten competencies in the new accreditation, uhm, standards for-- at social work education. That US practitioner are researcher. Ah, that you're-- every time you're helping someone it say, an end of one, right? You're making a hypothesis if I do this I think this will help. And actually try this with some-- someone that's very challenging, right from the ground floor and evaluate and see how they do. Ah, and as we get this growing by the evidence then oftentimes agency directors and then go say, uhm, this is I think a pretty effective way to go. It's efficient, it's effective. So, we-- I can your resource is around the strengths assessment, the personal wellness plan, publications, I've done research on factors that promote engagement just looking at that first visit, how critical that first visit is and we can send some resources around that. There are whole bunch of publications as well if people with e-mail. I think I actually sent them to you all for this conference that would be great resources for people to go to. The SAMHSA website, Substance, Abuse, Mental Health, Service Administration has some really good research on there. They actually have a copy of a strength assessment that I developed for youth on the SAMHSA website. I don't know how it got there but that's okay as long as things get out there, right, and people can use them. Uhm, so there's a lot of good resources out there and, ah, and again if anybody, ah, is having trouble finding these just e-mail me out. I'm, I'm usually pretty good getting back to people. 

00:45:35
THOM PANCELLA You employed of your rather talents as well, ah, in, in the work that you do. Ah, and I think it's a good time to, to integrate that into this conversation as well. 

00:45:45
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT All right. 

00:45:45
THOM PANCELLA Because it's not just about the research. 

00:45:45
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT Right. Exactly. 

00:45:45
THOM PANCELLA It's not just about a... 

00:45:45
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT Well... 

00:45:45
THOM PANCELLA It's, it's bringing people in as people as you, you mentioned the joy you even pointed back to your guitar. 

00:45:55
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT That's right. Yes. Well, as, as, as I've mentioned today and as Thom and I were talking the strengths, strengths perspective means not just looking for the best within each person we're working with in particular talents and wisdom and skills that they have. It's looking at ourselves. What are passions? What are we good at? Ah, if we're good at we love to arrange flowers why not kind of work with the person who also enjoys flowers and use your gifts to help to teach them how to do it. So we're both kind of bringing our strengths. Well, one of the things that I thought I love music, I play the guitar and in my research I actually got feedback from the service participants about what is was like to have a persistent mental illness from the case managers what it was like to try to do this work. And a lot of what I heard was so incredible in terms of the words it round up being poetry and then some of those poems became songs. And so, if, if I might and maybe I can close our, our very enjoyable time tonight by doing one of those songs. Now, I-- I'm wondering which one would be, would be kind of fine and give you a kind of a, a sense for the humor and the kinda message them trying to say and I think this one will be actually the first one I ever did this was a, this was a, a little bit of a stretch we talk with, we could-- you know, to do this because I'm talking of case managers and all these crisis and the paperwork's and the progress and I got to thinking of the case management blues. And then I sort to think about the summer time blues and it's that tune different words and this is case management blues. 

00:47:40

00:47:45
DR. WALTER KISTHARDT They say you got to get the clients to take their medication. Ba-da-da-dum. Da-da-da-dum. Then keep the landlord happy to prevent their eviction. Da-da-da-dum. Da-da-da-dum. When I went to my supervisor while I was on the run but the boss said, no time now are those progress note is done. Sometimes I wonder why do what I do. Will there ain't no cure for case management blues. Oh well I know for sure I ain't in it for the money. Da-da-da-dum. Da-da-da-dum. For all the problems people have which keep me hopping like a bunny. Da-da-da-dum. Da-da-da-dum. When I went to the director said my head will spin and she said, that's too bad, are your billing forms in. Sometimes I wonder why I do what I do. Will there ain't no cure for case management blues. I'm gonna take two weeks ahead of summer vacation. Da-da-da-dum. Da-da-da-dum. Going to take my problem to the mental health association. Da-da-da-dum. Da-da-da-dum. When I went to the commissioner who was running late and he said, oh by the way, what's your hospitalization rate? Sometimes I wonder why I do what I do. Will there ain't no cure for case management blues. Oh well there must be a song that can give my job some meaning. Da-da-da-dum. Da-da-da-dum. Something for me than helping clients with their cleaning. Da-da-da-dum. Da-da-da-dum. When I went to the person who smile warmly at me and he said, I have a warn for you I don't where I'd be. At times like this I know why I do what I do. Well, there is a cure for case management blues.
