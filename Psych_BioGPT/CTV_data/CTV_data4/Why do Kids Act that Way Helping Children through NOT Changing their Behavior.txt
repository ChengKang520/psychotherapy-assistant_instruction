NANCY BUCK Why do kids act that way? That's a question I hear a lot I hear it from parents. I hear it from teachers. I hear it from other adults who may be in the grocery store observing a child who seems to be out of control. I hear it from people at church who are kind of admonishing; they're not only thinking why do kids act that way, they're also thinking why don't their adult parents do something about it. So let me explain to you why kids do act that way. You'll probably be surprised by what I'm gonna share with you. From a child's perspective their behavior is never their problem. It's somebody's problem. It's the adult's problem. But it's never the child's problem. Let's go all the way back and think about if you've ever spent time with a baby or an infant and the baby starts crying. We understand when we're observing these children that the baby is unhappy but not just cause they're unhappy, there's something that the baby wants. And as a counselor who's working with parents, especially first time parents of young children, part of what we can do is share with them the baby is not trying to disturb your sleep. The baby is not trying to make life unhappy for you. In fact, what's happening is the baby is unhappy and doing all that he can to express to you there's something I need, there's something I want, can you please help me? And again, if you've spent time with children you understand that. So you hear the baby cry, you try to guess what might be wrong. Pick the baby up, change the diaper, feed the baby, walk the baby, burp the baby, rock the baby, do everything you can think of and finally you come upon what it is that the baby wants. And the baby stops crying. They settle down. Ah. You figured it out. That's what the baby wanted. So what happens, why don't we keep that same idea in mind as children get older, as they get taller, and as their language skills develop? No, in fact what happens is we look at the behavior and think there's something wrong with the behavior and we try to change the behavior. Let me take it back for a minute to counseling 101 that you learned where as a counselor your job is to start where a client is. You need to help the client with the client's problem. As a counselor, you can also share that information with the parents and the adults who are dealing with the child. Your problem is an unhappy misbehaving child. But you gotta start where the child is, not where the adult is. So if you have a child who's misbehaving, what we need to do is go back in our memory and think about the baby who was crying who was unhappy. And what did we do? We tried to help that baby calm down, get what it is she needed and wanted and then the crying stopped. The same magic can occur with children. So you have a child, perhaps you're a school counselor and you're working with a teacher who's very frustrated about one child in class in particular who repeatedly is disruptive. And the teacher has done all that he knows how to do to perhaps monitor the child's behavior, give the child stickers and if he behaves the way you want him to all the way through the class. And he does it enough times he'll win some kind of an award or reward. Eventually what happens is the teacher is still fairly frustrated and sends the child to the school counselor who also is trying to figure out how to change this child's behavior. Here's the magic. Here's what I wanna share with you that will make all the difference for what's happening for children and the adults. The next time you see a child misbehave, what I want you to do is to ask the child what is it that you want that you're trying to get by disrupting your neighbor in class? What is it that you want that you're trying to get by kicking your sister and grabbing the remote control? What is it that you want that you're trying to get by pitching a fit in the grocery store? As you can see, the question is what is it that you want, you're trying to get by doing blank and the blank is whatever the misbehavior is. Now I call this question a magical question and the reason I call it a magical question is children answer. They tell you what they want. I'm disrupting my neighbor cause this is a boring class and it's more fun to fool around with my next door neighbor than it is to pay attention to what the teacher's talking about. I'm kicking my sister cause she keeps bugging me and I want the remote control. She always wins the remote control. I'm doing what I'm doing in the grocery store cause this is kinda boring and it's more fun to act up a little bit. Maybe somebody'll give me a treat to shut me up in the grocery store. Children tell you what they want. Again, let me remind you from a child's perspective, their behavior is not their problem. Their problem is there's something that they want, there's something that they need and they don't know how to get it any other way than behaving irresponsibly and disrespectfully. So now that we've asked the question what is it that you want you're trying to get by grabbing that toy from your friend? “I want that toy.” The next question we ask is where we help adults do their job. Their job is to help children learn how to get what they need and want responsibly and respectfully. So we teach, we say if we can figure out a way to help you get what you want respectfully and responsibly, are you willing to work it out? Nine times out of ten the answer to that question is gonna be yes. I am willing to get what I want. So what I want is more fun in the grocery store than what's happening now. Great. We can figure out a way to make the grocery store more interesting, then the child will go along and figure out how to get what they want responsibly and respectfully. You see all children are driven from birth in an attempt to get what they need, to get what they want. Our job is to teach them how to get it responsibly and respectfully. Children are not born driven to, children are born driven to behave but they're not born knowing how to behave responsibly and respectfully. And when you teach a child how to get what they want responsibly and respectfully they do it. Now additional pieces that I need to help you remember, just cause you taught the child once doesn't mean they get it. So I've had more than a few parents say to me I already taught him a better way to get what he wants is to follow the rules and do what I ask and then he's more likely to be able to have the free time and do what he wants in the free time. I told him that. We went through this already. He's still misbehaving. Yes. That's right. Children don't hear it once, understand it once and think it's all over. They have to practice and they have to practice. And they have to practice. So let me tell you a story. I have identical twin sons who are wonderful men now. When they were children one of the things that they would do is that Paul would go over, see the toy that David was playing with and attempt to hit him or hit him to get the toy. If I was fast enough I'd catch him before he actually hit his brother and I'd say, “Paul, what is it that you want you're trying to get by thinking about hitting your brother?” “That toy.” “If we could figure out a way to help you get the toy without hurting your brother, are you willing to work it out?” “Yes,” he said. So how do you think you might do it? Now we've been through this routine once or twice or 700 times before. “Well I could ask him.” ”Okay, go ahead and ask.” “David, could I have that toy?” And what do you think David said? Of course he said no. It's a much better toy now than it was two seconds ago. ”What else could you do?” “Well, I could ask you to set the timer.” Yes, when both boys wanted a toy at the same time I would set the timer and when the timer went off they would switch. “Or what else could you do?” And it's the old Tom Sawyer approach that I learned by watching them. Paul could go to the other side of the room, pick up another toy, start playing with it, make it look so juicy and so irresistible. David drops his toy, came over, Paul gave him that toy and now the toy was free that Paul wanted. He went over and picked it up. But of course you know that was not the end of the story. Because two seconds later David is now over thinking about grabbing the toy from his brother or hitting his brother to get the toy and now I'm asking David the exact same question. However what I will also tell you, this question is such a powerful question. It's teaching children self discipline. It's teaching children to understand there's something that they need, there's something that they want and they could figure out how to get what it is that they need and want responsibly and respectfully. So eventually what happens is that children start asking themselves the same question; “What is it that I want? Is there another way I could go about getting it that might be more responsible and more respectful?” This is also a great question you can teach teachers to use not just when children are misbehaving. If two children are working together on a project in the class, you can say, “Girls, what is it that you want you're trying to get by working together?” Now the girls are gonna look at you like you're a little nuts. “What do you mean? We're not in trouble.” “No no no. I see you working so well together cooperatively. I'm just curious. What is it that you want that you're getting by working cooperatively together?” They'll answer, “It's more fun. It's easier to do the work together.” Excellent. So you don't only have to ask this question when children are misbehaving. Let me kind of repeat this question again for you. What is it that you want that you're trying to get by blank? That's not a normal, natural statement. It's actually a kind of convoluted statement. It's not even good English. But when you ask the question just this way, people and children answer. It's the same thing as asking children why did you do it? But my guess is if you've had any experience with children at all or have worked with adults who have experience with children, children answer that question exactly the same way all around the world. ”Why did you do it?” “I don't know.” Or, “she made me do it.” But when you ask what is it that you want you're trying to get by doing what it is you're doing, then they'll tell you. So I would encourage you to write it down. For some parents you might wanna give them a cue card, they write it down for themselves. For some educators or teachers in school, you might actually literally write it on a kid's forehead. I'm only kidding. But you may have to ask this question more than once. And they'll eventually answer it. Now I do wanna give you one caveat for those of you who are working with parents who have teenagers. Teenagers and parents are an interesting relationship. That's an understatement. But one of the things that parents need to know when they ask their child what is it that you want you're trying to get by blank, one of the things that teenagers want is for their parents not to know what they want. So they won't necessarily answer. School counselors and counselors who are not the parents have a greater chance of getting an answer to the question. Parents should still ask the question even though a child may not answer. What you're trying to do is to get the child to start thinking that question for herself, for himself. What is it that I want? Is there another more responsible, more respectful way I can go about getting what it is that I want? Lastly, this is a powerful question that you can teach parents to ask themselves. What is it that I want that I'm trying to get by yelling at my child? If I could figure out another way, am I willing to do it? And of course the answer is yes. They don't know what else to do. That's why they're yelling. And if they can figure out another way and take some minutes to think about it, it's a better way to go. It's a great question you can ask yourself. What is it that I want that I'm trying to get by screaming at the other drivers on the road? I want them to stop driving like jerks, I want them to get out of my way, and if I could figure out another way to get it am I willing to do it? And the answer often is no. Cause sometimes having an argument with another driver while you're alone in your car is a satisfying thing to do. As long as you're not doing a whole lot of danger or road rage. But this is a powerful question that you could ask yourself, you can ask your clients, you can also ask your clients who are working with children. What is it that you want and if I can figure out a way or we can figure out a way to help you get it responsibly and respectfully, are you willing to learn? Are you willing to work it out? So now when I ask you why do kids act that way, you know. They're acting that way because they don't know a better way to get what it is they need and they want. I hope I've given you some food for thought, I've given you a different perspective to contemplate and I've given you some ideas for a more effective practice.

THERAPY Talks 

00:15:10
SHANNON DERMER Doctor Buck, thank you so much. That was a very interesting talk. I want to ask you a few questions. What made you think of the magic question? How did you come up with that? 

00:15:25
NANCY BUCK Well, certainly part of it was having identical twin sons who were into a lot of trouble. But really the idea is based on Doctor Glasser, William Glasser, founder of William Glasser Institute. He's also the author of “Reality Therapy,” most people know about that book. And he's also the creator of choice theory psychology which teaches us that all behavior's purposeful. So when a child is behaving, I know it's purposeful. But it may not be responsible and respectful. So it really is reality therapy turned inside out. But the real answer, Shannon, is it was survival. 

00:16:00
SHANNON DERMER Survival with your two identical twins? 

00:16:00
NANCY BUCK Exactly. 

00:16:05
SHANNON DERMER So you're saying even children choose their behavior. How do you keep parents, then, from thinking that their kids are doing it on purpose to annoy them if they're choosing their behavior? 

00:16:15
NANCY BUCK Right. Well I actually don't spend a great deal of time in the beginning talking to parents about these behaviors are a choice because in fact it does get into potential trouble further down the line when parents begin to think about it for themselves. Including, parents are making a choice. But the part that it really is very helpful when I say to a parent between you and the child, one of you needs to be the adult. And it's you. And you have more experience. You have more understanding. And hopefully you have more flexibility. So if you go to the child understanding that the child is only having a problem, it looks like misbehavior, but it's simply a problem, and if you can help that child get what they need and want without misbehaving, will that help you parent get what you want? And of course the answer always is yes. But it's really hard to start behaving differently as a parent. Just like it's really hard for the children to start behaving differently. 

00:17:10
SHANNON DERMER So their behavior is really a form of communication to their parents about what they need and want. 

00:17:15
NANCY BUCK Exactly. And again, for many parents, when I say to this, “Remember when your children were really young and they couldn't talk and all they could do is cry and you would look at this baby and you'd say, if you could only tell me what you want.” We understood that the fact their crying wasn't their behavior. Their crying was a form of communication. Now when you have a child who's misbehaving in church, if we could turn and say if you could only tell me what you want. Instead, what we think about is what we want, which is a child who's behaving well in church, not just cause we want it but also what is everybody thinking about how my child is misbehaving. 

00:17:55
SHANNON DERMER Right. And so have you ever had instances where children, how do you help children understand that sometimes you can communicate what you need and you want but you can't get it in that moment or in that way that you want it? 

00:18:10
NANCY BUCK Actually the thing that children have always been accused of having difficulty delaying gratification. I just find that funny. Do you know how many adults do you know who have difficulty delaying gratification? I'm among them. But mostly what a child is trying to communicate is there's something I want and need. And if someone says, “I understand honey, there's something you want and need and I'll help you get it. Maybe not in this moment, but I can help you get it.” A grandma was talking to me about, “Well what happens when a grandchild comes over and starts carrying on and I say, “What is it you want?” And they say, “A red lollipop. You only have green lollipops in this house.” “Okay, so let's make a plan together so that next time you come visit Grandma, she'll be sure to have red lollipops.” Okay, doesn't mean the kid's happy and says, “Yippee, I'm gonna have red lollipops later.” However, the child does understand, “I've been heard. I've been understood. And Grandma's willing to work with me to help me get more of what it is that I want.” When my 14 year old boys said, “Mom, can we drive a car?” And I said, “Yes. Great. How old are you?” “14. How old do you have to be to have a driver's license in San Rhode Island?” “16. So we're gonna have to wait a couple of years.” Again, they weren't thrilled. “That's not fair. Our fried Matt gets to drive wherever he wants.” “Yes, where does Matt live?” “On a farm.” “Good. He chose better parents. You happened to choose parents who don't live on a farm.” So children understand. That doesn't mean they like it. However, if you can just imagine, just imagine, if you got more of what you wanted in the course of your day, wouldn't you have a better day? So those moments when you can't get what you want may not be delightful, but they're not horrible. 

00:19:50
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:19:50
SHANNON DERMER So you're really, it's a message to the parents on how to communicate with their children. It's a message to the children on how to communicate what they want. But you're also engaging, it sounds like the parents and children in a problem solving process together instead of you think parents usually try to solve things for their children? 

00:20:10
Nancy Buck, Ph.D. 

00:20:10
NANCY BUCK Well that's another talk. And I'm happy to talk about that eventually. But usually for this particular magical question, it really is that moment when you're being, when the parent is being pulled in a direction that he doesn't wanna go by the child who wants to go in that direction. And too frequently what parents do is yank that kid back to go in the direction that the parent wants. So it is the beginning of a form of negotiation. I have a picture in my head of what I want. You, child, have a picture in your head. Our job is to find out what the pictures are and see how we can put them together. But that's good intellectually and you move in that direction. But in the moment, when they're in WalMart screaming at the top of their lungs, what are you gonna do? And one of the things you do is leave WalMart, and you might scream with them if you also need to pitch a fit. But then you say, what is it you want you're trying to get by screaming? If we can figure out another way to help you get what you want, are you willing to work it out? So it's an immediate alternative to the if you don't then I'm going to, or the threats, or the bribes. It's an immediate understanding that your child does have a problem but it's a different problem from you. 

00:21:25
SHANNON DERMER Okay. So sometimes you do have to treat the situation as a crisis and remove them from that situation before you ask them the question. But you always go to evetually to the magic question. 

00:21:40
NANCY BUCK Right. And I'm certainly as a person who understands children and works with parents, I'm not the only person who talks about giving children time out. Absolutely. But it's not time alone that is the magic. Because the reason you put the child in time out is that they had more freedom than they could handle responsibly. So you put them in a place where they're not gonna hurt themselves or anybody else, including you. And now at the end of it though, you still wanna go back because the child still has no better of an idea how to get what it is that they need and want than they did before the time out. And so you simply ask the question. Eventually the biggest liability for parents when they teach their children this is the children learn it and they turn it back on their parents. “What is it you want Mom you're trying to get by nagging me? If we can figure out another way, are you willing to do it without nagging?” And of course I'm horrified. Who taught you that idea? But it's a great reminder because each of us is doing what we are doing in an attempt to get what we need and want. Our job as adults working with children is helping children learning how to do that responsibly and respectfully. 

00:22:45
SHANNON DERMER Responsibly and respectfully. Let me ask you. Even though the question does not have proper grammar, it's still magic, it's magical, it works. Why do you think that this simple question works so well? 

00:23:00
NANCY BUCK Because a child's behavior is driven by the want. And they know what they want. I want the red lollipop. I wanna be at the front of the line. I wanna have my curfew extended even though my mother doesn't think it's a good idea. I wanna go on this website even though you think it's not the appropriate website for a child my age or a young adult my age. People are driven. That's what drives all behavior is the pictures in our head of what we want. So it's just another way of saying, “So what is it you really want?” Adding the by doing what you're doing can also help children begin to understand that what they're doing may not be the most effective. And then there's always that problem, is it effective, it works. You know if I want the toy, if I punch you and pinch you I get the toy. It's very effective. However, it's not responsible and it's not respectful. 

00:23:50
SHANNON DERMER That's the part I'm sure parents like about the message. 

00:23:50
NANCY BUCK And again if you use the question on parents, what is it that you want that you're trying to get by punishing your child? I want my child to learn to be responsible and respectful. Great. If we could figure out a way to help you get your child, help teach your child to be responsible and respectful without punishing, without being mean, without threatening, are you interested in learning? And almost always the answer is yes. They don't know another way. 

00:24:15
SHANNON DERMER So this magic question is, and I think you've said it several times throughout your talk, is about helping children be respectful and responsible. But it's also about helping both parents and children getting what they need and what they want. 

00:24:30
NANCY BUCK Exactly. Exactly. 

00:24:35
SHANNON DERMER One of the things that you said that was very interesting is not just using this question when children are misbehaving. Can you say a little bit more about how you help remind parents or school counselors or counselors, educators, to ask that question when kids are behaving any why you do that? 

00:24:55
NANCY BUCK Okay so there's a couple of answers and things to talk about. And I'll just mention this briefly. We can get into it further if you want. But the way our brain is set up, our brain is set up to pay attention to things that are off, that we don't notice the things that are right. That in fact when we're in a room and the temperature's comfortable, we don't even notice that the temperature is comfortable. It's when we walk into a cold room or walk into a room that's too hot that we notice. When our children are behaving beautifully, we don't even notice. Our brain doesn't say, “Pay attention. Something important is happening here.” Now this was set up way back when biologically when we were being created as creatures to survive we needed to know not pretty kitty cat, oh my gosh a lion. We needed to get that kind of an alarm. And the same thing happens however in our lives. And there's some paying stop and smell the roses or counting your blessings, it's just another way of talking about pay attention to when the things are right. So we have to go out of our way, work against our brain to pay attention to when children are doing things well. The other piece of this and this is particularly interesting for teachers and educators in school but not only, children who are good learners don't know what they do to be good learners. What are good study habits? You ask a child who's a good student what their good study habits are, they have no idea. “I don't know. I just get it.” ”You do your homework?” “Well sure I do my homework.” “Well do you practice?” “Well sure I practice.” Those are good study habits but the child has no idea. And somewhere along the line for some of those kids they get to the point where they're not doing so well and they don't know, “Geez, what did I do to do well before?” They don't know what their good study habits are. It's also a powerful question for good students to share with students who aren't as effective. Look this is what they do. These are some of the strategies they use to be able to succeed in the class not only academically but socially and in terms of class management. So if we start asking children to pay attention, they start being more aware of the kinds of effective behaviors that they use. It's also as a counselor, don't tell anybody this, but it's great, we'll keep it between you and me, if you start asking children who are effective what they do, the next kid who comes in, you can offer these as strategies that the child may never have thought of. So it's a great question as a self-evaluation for counselors. What do I do that makes me an effective counselor? 

00:27:20
SHANNON DERMER So it's not, so you're saying then that this question is something that should be asked when people notice a difference that they don't like, when they notice what they do like. It can be asked of children, it can be asked of educators, counselors. It can be asked of parents, that this really is then a magic question. It can be asked of everyone to help everyone get what they need and want. But I think sometimes we don't think children have the insight to be asked that type of question. And you're saying they actually do. 

00:28:00
NANCY BUCK They do. And usually their wants are so concrete. Often we worry, actually let me say that differently, the assumption is children want more attention. Sometimes what they want is more attention. But sometimes hat they want is a red lollipop. 

00:28:10
SHANNON DERMER So sometimes what they want is a red lollipop. And what we wanted today was some good advice and counseling on how to work with children effectively and some good advice for parents. So I wanna thank you Doctor Buck today for all of your help and for your magic question.
