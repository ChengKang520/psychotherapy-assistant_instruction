BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
PETER LEVINE Right. So, I don't know if you know who I am. I often ask myself the same question. Uhm, I'm okay, in the world l'm Peter Levine developer of Somatic Experiencing, ah, somatic approach to the transformation of trauma that start worldwide to our institute trauma healing.com. And, ah, they kinda supporting me to, uhm, to do what I wanna do which is to do fun things like this. Uhm, so how many of you have some idea of my approach, the approach of somatic experiencing approach? Okay, about a quarter of you. All right. Well, why not start from, uhm, me not saying anything about it and seeing where we go, and exploring with you what you think might be helpful for you and your life. And you can say something about your history if you want but it's not necessary. 

00:01:15
SUE All right, uhm, I noticed over the years that I'm not as fluid in my body as I would like to be. And-- so one of my goals in coming up here-- you can't hear me? Is that better? Ah, yeah. 

00:01:30
PETER LEVINE But-- yeah, maybe they can turn the volume up to. Thank you. 

00:01:30
SUE Okay. Thank you. And I'll try-- I sometimes my voice drops out so I'll try and be conscious of that. Ah, so as I was saying, I fo-- found over the years that I'm more constricted in my body than I would like to be. And I'm also probably more constricted in my relating to people than I would like to be. 

00:01:55
PETER LEVINE Ah-huh. And just noticing this movement here. 

00:01:55
SUE Uh-hmm. 

00:01:55
PETER LEVINE When you say relating to peo-- when you say relating to people. Just noticing the movements that you're making, just feeling. 

00:02:05
SUE Uh-hmm. 

00:02:05
PETER LEVINE Not have to understand it, just feel it. See what it's like from the inside. Okay. Ah-huh. And you just notice that spontaneous breaths? 

00:02:20
SUE Yes. 

00:02:20
PETER LEVINE Great. Okay, does that move you little bit towards the flow you're looking for? 

00:02:25
SUE Yes. 

00:02:25
PETER LEVINE Okay, so we're on the right track. And, ah, and also to the group that that's okay. So in this approach, we're looking not only at the person's story they're in-- their narrative, their story which could be some of your history, which again we can talk about. Uhm, but the narrative of the body-- what the story of the body is beginning to tell, because that sometimes a very different story and ultimately - 

00:02:55
SUE Hmm. 

00:02:55
PETER LEVINE - we bring them together in a, in a, in a session. So... 

00:03:00
SUE So... 

00:03:05
PETER LEVINE Let's continue... 

00:03:05
SUE Uhm, side of the-- the highlight of the trauma highlights of my life - 

00:03:10
PETER LEVINE Okay. 

00:03:10
SUE - cuz there have been many. 

00:03:10
PETER LEVINE Sure. Sure. 

00:03:10
SUE - uhm, put in an incubator for the first three weeks of my life. 

00:03:15
PETER LEVINE Ah. 

00:03:15
SUE Uhm, okay, my mother had postpartum depression. 

00:03:20
PETER LEVINE Uhm. 

00:03:20
SUE Uhm, I was very close to her and then when I was about 7 she was in a couple of car accidents. And so I got yelled at every time I tried to touch her or hold her hand from that point forward... 

00:03:35
PETER LEVINE Oh, again feeling your hand there on your chest - 

00:03:35
SUE Yeah, yeah. 

00:03:40
PETER LEVINE - and the movement of your hand - 

00:03:40
SUE Yeah. 

00:03:40
PETER LEVINE - we'll come back to the story if you want but just feeling what's going - 

00:03:45
SUE Uh-hmm. 

00:03:45
PETER LEVINE - what's going on right there. 

00:03:45
SUE All right. Huh. 

00:03:50
PETER LEVINE I'm sorry. I-- I'll try to be louder. 

00:03:50
SUE Yeah. Uhm, thank you. 

00:03:55
PETER LEVINE I now repeat her if she's soft. So don't worry about it. 

00:04:00
SUE All right. So, the slowing down feels really good. 

00:04:05
PETER LEVINE Okay, the slowing down feels good. 

00:04:05
SUE All right. 

00:04:05
PETER LEVINE Okay. 

00:04:05
SUE So, so then just the couple of other pieces. So, 13 was supposed to go sailing with my dad. Got in a fight with him because he wouldn't let a friend go and he went-- and was killed on the boat that day. 

00:04:20
PETER LEVINE Oh, oh, my god. 

00:04:20
SUE So, uhm... 

00:04:20
PETER LEVINE Uhm, okay, take a moment. 

00:04:20
SUE Yeah. 

00:04:25
PETER LEVINE Really, I imagined that something you visited. But just to revisit it and to feel your feet... 

00:04:30
SUE Yeah. 

00:04:30
PETER LEVINE Yeah, I feel your feet on the ground. 

00:04:35
SUE Yeah. 

00:04:35
PETER LEVINE And I'll put my foot close to yours if you like. 

00:04:35
SUE Hmm. 

00:04:40
PETER LEVINE Okay. 

00:04:40
SUE Hmm. 

00:04:40
PETER LEVINE That way we can keep a little contact - 

00:04:40
SUE Yeah. 

00:04:40
PETER LEVINE You know. 

00:04:45
SUE So, uhm... 

00:04:45
PETER LEVINE I put my foot on her foot just to keep contact - 

00:04:45
SUE Yeah. 

00:04:50
PETER LEVINE - in a non-obtrusive way. 

00:04:50
SUE And it feels really, really good that you did-- that feels like a huge gift. 

00:04:55
PETER LEVINE Gift. Okay, I'm glad it feels like a gift. 

00:05:00
SUE Yeah. Uhm, so then the rest of the traumas are relatively minor, a couple of car accidents. One was where I described it as being the sandwich and the bread because I was getting off the highway and someone was coming up the wrong way. So I was hit my-- the car was hit from the front and the back at the same time. And there's a lot of resonating visceral reaction from that still - 

00:05:20
PETER LEVINE Hmm. Hmm. 

00:05:20
SUE - uhm, if, if I get upset I can still feel the shaking. 

00:05:25
PETER LEVINE Whoa! So, let's just take moment to notice what's going on in your body, sensation, feeling those images, whatever that it just take your time with your eyes closed or open. Whichever is better for you. Always give choice. Trauma is about no choice. 

00:05:45
SUE Hmm, hmm. 

00:05:45
PETER LEVINE But just taking a moment to catch what's going on. 

00:05:50
SUE Yeah. 

00:05:55
[sil.] 

00:06:00
SUE Yeah. 

00:06:00
PETER LEVINE Uh-hmm. What happened Sue(ph)? 

00:06:05
SUE I, ah, I feel not only that-- but it ties back to another incident when I was a kid and I was at the beach and a big wave was coming in and I went to somebody that I thought was gonna be able to help me which was big guy. 

00:06:15
PETER LEVINE Uh-hmm. 

00:06:20
SUE And instead he fell on top of me, so I was trapped under the water and so there's that visceral sensation and... 

00:06:25
PETER LEVINE Okay, so again feeling the visceral sensation, feeling the movement. 

00:06:30
SUE Hmm. 

00:06:35
PETER LEVINE And take your time, just take your time, take all the time you need, really you have all the time in the world that you need right now. 

00:06:45
SUE Hmm. 

00:06:45
PETER LEVINE I'm noticing the smile. 

00:06:50
SUE I'm thinking it was a great hypnotic. 

00:06:55
PETER LEVINE We always have overlap - 

00:06:55
SUE Yeah. 

00:06:55
PETER LEVINE - every, every method has its overlap for sure. 

00:07:00
SUE Hmm. Yeah. 

00:07:05
[sil.] 

00:07:10
SUE So, and, and just take it-- as the last piece which I told you before is working the side at, uhm, at Ground Zero at the World Trade Center for the first week after the towers went down. 

00:07:20
PETER LEVINE Ah-huh. In, in what kind of work were doing at Ground Zero? 

00:07:25
SUE Ah, I was doing a combination of crisis response and supply chain management, uhm... 

00:07:30
PETER LEVINE Okay. 

00:07:30
SUE And a lot of it was were as booking with the volunteers, working with the fire department, working with the police. 

00:07:35
PETER LEVINE Okay, so were really exposed to a lot of stuff. 

00:07:40
SUE Yeah, and I was at the ed-- I went on the pile once but that was... 

00:07:40
PETER LEVINE You went on? 

00:07:40
SUE On the pile on-- the, the piles... 

00:07:45
PETER LEVINE Piles. Yeah. 

00:07:45
SUE Yeah. 

00:07:45
PETER LEVINE What just happened when you said pile and went like that? 

00:07:50
SUE I, I-- I'd-- my, my whole system just went so... 

00:07:50
PETER LEVINE Okay, we need to stay with that for a little bit okay. 

00:07:55
SUE Okay. 

00:07:55
PETER LEVINE We really do. Just-- sorry, we're gonna put the side... 

00:08:00
SUE That's fine, you don't need to say sorry... 

00:08:00
PETER LEVINE Just need to stay with this activation. 

00:08:05
[sil.] 

00:08:10
PETER LEVINE And just notice if it increases, decreases, remains the same or changes to something else. 

00:08:20
SUE So it's changed. 

00:08:25
PETER LEVINE Okay. It's changed. 

00:08:25
SUE And the-- yeah, so there's like this sort of empty space right here. 

00:08:30
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:08:30
SUE And then a lot of tension - 

00:08:30
PETER LEVINE Okay. 

00:08:35
SUE - and holding up here. 

00:08:35
PETER LEVINE Okay. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna work with this area a little bit. I'm also noticing right now that your posture is more relaxed. Your spine is straighter, there's a little lift which is really good. 

00:08:50
SUE Hmm. 

00:08:50
PETER LEVINE So, I'd like to work with you with a particular sound. By the way this is a sound that you can use in your practice and you will. I imagine be using in your practice. I'll say a little bit more about it later. But, uhm, have you ever lived, ah, ah, near the-- a bay or an ocean? Where was that? 

00:09:10
SUE I grew in Milford, Connecticut. We live right on the water. 

00:09:15
PETER LEVINE Oh, okay. Well, when I lived in, ah, Berkeley I used to go to San Francisco and drive of this little road that nobody knew about and sit underneath the Golden Gate Bridge. 

00:09:25
SUE Wow. 

00:09:25
PETER LEVINE I mean, the Homeland Security would not allow that but that was in the '60s. 

00:09:30
SUE Yeah. 

00:09:35
PETER LEVINE But the thing that was magical for me was watching the fog roll in. 

00:09:40
SUE Hmm. 

00:09:40
PETER LEVINE And then the sound of the foghorns that were drawing the boats back, back into safe harbor. 

00:09:45
SUE Hmm. 

00:09:45
PETER LEVINE And the sound was like this, then I'll just demonstrate it and then you and I can do it together okay. And the idea is to vibrate the sound as though as coming right from that area - 

00:09:55
SUE Hmm. 

00:10:00
PETER LEVINE - in your upper belly here. Your epigastrium and the sound goes like this. Voooooooooooooo-- and let the all-- the sound the air go out. And then just wait for the next breath to come in on its own. And again, voooooooooo... 

00:10:30
SUE Voooooooo... 

00:10:35
PETER LEVINE Good, let the breath come in. Vooooo... 

00:10:45
SUE Voooooooo... 

00:10:50
[sil.] 

00:10:55
PETER LEVINE Nice. And again. Oh, just rest. Just rest. Good. And I don't know if you noticed but your shoulder, especially your right shoulder just rock about an inch and a half. 

00:11:10
SUE Hmm. 

00:11:15
PETER LEVINE But just sense what's going on in your body and close your eyes if you want. I'll keep my foot here. You tell me if you want me to me-- remove it. 

00:11:25
[sil.] 

00:11:30
SUE So my upper body is sort-- is vibrating. 

00:11:35
PETER LEVINE Uh-hmm. 

00:11:35
SUE But it feels as if from here down, this frozen. 

00:11:35
PETER LEVINE Okay, you feel the vibration here? 

00:11:40
SUE The vibration feels like it goes all the way down here. 

00:11:40
PETER LEVINE To your pelvis. 

00:11:45
SUE Yeah. 

00:11:45
PETER LEVINE Okay, okay. So, what I want you to do is with your awareness just shift back and forth between the sensations up here and the lack of the sensation down there, the frozenness down there. 

00:12:00
[sil.] 

00:12:25
PETER LEVINE What happened Sue(ph)? 

00:12:30
SUE So there's the tingling is reduced a little bit on the top but there's a greater relaxation. 

00:12:35
PETER LEVINE You feel the relaxation. How do you experience the relaxation? 

00:12:40
SUE The muscles appeared or it feel-- instead of being like this or like that. 

00:12:50
PETER LEVINE Great, great. Instead of being like this, you're like that. 

00:12:55
[sil.] 

00:13:00
PETER LEVINE Okay, okay. Uhm, I'm gonna give you a sentence and these are my words, they're not your words. It may mean nothing. Ah, I'm just asking you to reserve what goes on in your body when you say these words, okay? 

00:13:15
SUE Hmm. 

00:13:15
PETER LEVINE So I'll you give you the words and then you say that, all right. I give myself this gift. 

00:13:20
SUE I give myself this gift. 

00:13:25
PETER LEVINE A pleasant relaxation. 

00:13:25
SUE A pleasant relaxation. 

00:13:30
PETER LEVINE I give myself this gift of pleasant relaxation. Hmm. 

00:13:35
SUE Ah, I give myself this gift of pleasant relaxation. 

00:13:35
PETER LEVINE Hmm, what's happening? 

00:13:40
SUE So it feels like my-- there's more spaciousness in my upper torso wo-- at first I felt a little sadness or by my eyes. 

00:13:50
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:13:50
SUE And then I noticed just more spaciousness in my upper torso and my lower body relaxed a little bit. 

00:14:00
PETER LEVINE It's still not as animated as I would like but it's relaxed... 

00:14:05
PETER LEVINE Yeah, I feel your movement, your hand movements. 

00:14:10
SUE Yeah. 

00:14:10
PETER LEVINE You're saying-- just noticing what your hands are saying to your legs. 

00:14:20
SUE So they're saying it's okay. 

00:14:20
PETER LEVINE It's okay, yeah, yeah. Let's just stay together here, okay. 

00:14:30
SUE Yeah. 

00:14:30
PETER LEVINE Yeah, it's okay. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Can I give you one another sentence? 

00:14:50
SUE But of course. 

00:14:50
PETER LEVINE I'm coming home. 

00:14:50
SUE Ah. Hmm. I'm coming home. 

00:14:55
PETER LEVINE Yeah, and again just noticing the sensations and feelings when you say those words. 

00:15:00
SUE Hmm, yeah. So, interesting. So there was a sense of aliveness but I noticed that my jag are tight. 

00:15:10
PETER LEVINE That's exactly where we're going. 

00:15:15
PETER LEVINE You are right with me, really. 

00:15:15
SUE Thank you. 

00:15:15
PETER LEVINE That's exactly where we're going right now. What we're gonna do is we're gonna start with the vo - 

00:15:20
SUE Uh-hmm. 

00:15:20
PETER LEVINE - and then you're gonna bring the jaw in. Okay, and I'll show you and then we can do it together. And by the way, if it seems absolutely silly then it means you're doing it perfectly right. Okay. Head that went off at the past. All right. Voooooooooo... 

00:15:45
SUE Vooooooo... 

00:15:50
[sil.] 

00:16:00
PETER LEVINE Whooh! 

00:16:00
SUE Whoa! 

00:16:05
PETER LEVINE Only banana split Sunday. Feel that ru-- rush of energy. You feel the warms in your face, in your throat. 

00:16:15
SUE Yeah. 

00:16:15
PETER LEVINE And your fingers too, and your hand. 

00:16:15
SUE Yeah. 

00:16:15
PETER LEVINE Praise. 

00:16:20
SUE No, no-- I, I do-- it, it was a little bit contaminated because I've actually I went to Africa to study the animals after reading your book. 

00:16:30
PETER LEVINE Oh-oh. 

00:16:30
SUE So, I-- I'm imaging the animals I saw on safari and... 

00:16:35
PETER LEVINE It was perfect. 

00:16:35
SUE Okay. 

00:16:35
PETER LEVINE It was absolutely perfect, really. Yeah. So, let's do this a little bit more again, okay. 

00:16:50
SUE Uh-hmm. 

00:16:50
PETER LEVINE Working with the whooh! Oh, that's nice. Actually let's do this a little bit. Just moving, feeling the movement here and then slowly letting it go. Feeling the movement and letting it go. Good. Okay. And how are you feeling in your body right now? How are you feeling in your body right now? 

00:17:25
SUE So there's a lot of energy here. 

00:17:30
PETER LEVINE Uh-hmm. 

00:17:30
SUE Uhm, I'm noticing that my head and my legs are still a little stuck. 

00:17:35
PETER LEVINE We're gonna connect them now. Okay. And again, you, uhm, if it-- if anything doesn't feel right to you or you wanted to do it different way, you let me know. Because really, I'm following you here. 

00:17:50
SUE Okay. 

00:17:50
PETER LEVINE All right. So we're gonna start with the, with the vo and get the jaw. And the idea with the jaw is it like open the jaw until you feel the resistance and then let it close a little bit and then open it again. So, vooooooooo... 

00:18:05
SUE Voooooooo... 

00:18:10
[sil.] 

00:18:20
PETER LEVINE And let's just stay in contact for a little bit. 

00:18:25
SUE I love it. I love to play it. 

00:18:25
PETER LEVINE I s-- never would have guessed. But you're f-- your are, are sparkling. 

00:18:35
SUE Hmm. 

00:18:35
PETER LEVINE They really are. I think you can feel that. 

00:18:40
SUE Uh-hmm. 

00:18:40
PETER LEVINE I have one more goofy sentence. All right. Ah, okay. I'm alive. 

00:18:45
SUE I'm alive. 

00:18:50
PETER LEVINE Alive and I'm real. 

00:18:50
SUE Alive... 

00:18:50
PETER LEVINE And I'm real. 

00:18:50
SUE And I'm real. 

00:18:55
PETER LEVINE And just noticing what happens. 

00:19:00
SUE So there's a little bit of a hit with I'm alive. 

00:19:05
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:19:05
SUE You know, and there's a bigger hit with I'm real. 

00:19:05
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:19:05
SUE Of... 

00:19:10
PETER LEVINE Right, not go with it. 

00:19:15
SUE Yeah. 

00:19:15
PETER LEVINE Yeah, all right. I want you to check to see if this feels right to you. I think we're headed towards what happened with your dad. 

00:19:25
SUE Uh-hmm. Yeah. 

00:19:25
PETER LEVINE Ah, feel that way to you? 

00:19:30
SUE Yeah. 

00:19:30
PETER LEVINE Okay. Hmm. Yeah. 

00:19:35
SUE Yeah. 

00:19:35
PETER LEVINE Because you're alive and he's not. 

00:19:40
SUE Yeah. 

00:19:40
PETER LEVINE Yeah. Hmm. 

00:19:45
SUE Yeah, and I'm a lot older than he was when he died. So... 

00:19:50
PETER LEVINE Uh-huh, and what about that? 

00:20:00
SUE Hmm, I never thought of it this way before but I think I feel guilty about it. 

00:20:00
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:20:05
SUE Yeah. 

00:20:05
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:20:05
SUE Yeah. 

00:20:10
PETER LEVINE Yeah, I think we can begin to untangle this a little bit, a bit and go over this. 

00:20:15
SUE Yeah. 

00:20:20
PETER LEVINE Okay. I like you to conjure an image of your dad, of the time when you were with him that was really good. That was pleasant in some way that enlightening in some way. 

00:20:40
[sil.] 

00:20:45
PETER LEVINE You have that image? 

00:20:45
SUE Yeah, my-- one the things that made it particular hardest, ah, and one of-- and one of the things that I said to myself when I was 13 is that I was lucky because most of my peers didn't have parents that love each other as much as I did - 

00:21:00
PETER LEVINE Hmm. 

00:21:00
SUE - and didn't have an-- as amazing a father as I have. And I had him at least for 13 years - 

00:21:05
PETER LEVINE Okay. 

00:21:05
SUE - but so when you're asking me for a memory, there are lot. 

00:21:10
PETER LEVINE There are lots 

00:21:15
SUE Yeah. 

00:21:15
PETER LEVINE Yeah, yeah. So, I'm gonna again suggest a sentence okay. 

00:21:20
SUE Uh-hmm. 

00:21:20
PETER LEVINE How did you call your dad, dad or father or... 

00:21:25
SUE It depend to-- if I was irritated with him it was probably dad and you know, - 

00:21:25
PETER LEVINE Ah, okay. 

00:21:25
SUE - it was daddy so... 

00:21:30
PETER LEVINE Okay. So either - 

00:21:30
SUE Yeah. 

00:21:30
PETER LEVINE - way daddy or dad. Daddy. 

00:21:35
SUE Hmm, daddy. 

00:21:35
PETER LEVINE I have so many wonderful memories of you. 

00:21:40
SUE Hmm. I have so many wonderful memories of you. 

00:21:40
PETER LEVINE And I hold them in my heart in the-- my body forever. 

00:21:45
SUE And I hold them in my heart and in my body forever. 

00:21:50
PETER LEVINE Yeah. I hold you in my heart. 

00:21:50
SUE I hold you in my heart. 

00:21:55
PETER LEVINE Hmm. So again just taking some moments. Hmm. Yeah. 

00:22:05
SUE Yeah. 

00:22:05
PETER LEVINE Yeah, wow. 

00:22:10
[sil.] 

00:22:15
PETER LEVINE Hmm. 

00:22:15
SUE Yeah, I went to an odd place which is that I worry about what's gonna happen when I die because whose gonna carry that. 

00:22:25
PETER LEVINE Whose gonna carry? 

00:22:30
SUE His memory. 

00:22:30
PETER LEVINE His memory. Whoa! 

00:22:30
SUE Yeah. 

00:22:35
PETER LEVINE Whoa! Well, I think you just opened something up that's gonna very important in your healing. 

00:22:40
SUE Yup. 

00:22:40
PETER LEVINE Very important in your healing. And I think it has something to do with finding the way that his life is gonna be carried forward. 

00:22:50
SUE Hmm. Yeah. 

00:22:55
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:23:00
[sil.] 

00:23:05
PETER LEVINE To work with some more words again some more sentences. Okay. 

00:23:15
[sil.] 

00:23:20
PETER LEVINE Dad. 

00:23:20
SUE Dad. 

00:23:25
PETER LEVINE I'm alive. 

00:23:25
SUE I'm alive. 

00:23:25
PETER LEVINE And you're not. 

00:23:25
SUE And you're not. 

00:23:30
PETER LEVINE And I know you celebrate my living, my life. 

00:23:35
SUE Ah, and I know you celebrate my living and my life. 

00:23:40
PETER LEVINE I have no doubt about that. 

00:23:45
SUE I have no doubt about that. 

00:23:45
PETER LEVINE Yeah. And I love you. 

00:23:50
SUE And I love you. 

00:23:50
PETER LEVINE More than words could ever say. 

00:23:55
SUE More than words could ever say. 

00:23:55
PETER LEVINE And I'm alive. 

00:23:55
SUE And I'm alive. 

00:23:55
PETER LEVINE And I'm real. 

00:24:00
SUE And I'm real. 

00:24:00
PETER LEVINE And I'm here. 

00:24:00
SUE And I'm here. 

00:24:00
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:24:05
SUE That really is true now. 

00:24:05
PETER LEVINE Yeah, that's right. And that was the missing piece. All right. Hmm. Hmm. 

00:24:15
SUE Uhm, yeah. 

00:24:20
PETER LEVINE Feel those waves? 

00:24:20
SUE Yeah. 

00:24:20
PETER LEVINE Yeah. Yeah, that's what flow is. 

00:24:30
SUE Hmm. 

00:24:35
[sil.] 

00:24:45
PETER LEVINE I really like your eyes. 

00:24:45
SUE Thank you. 

00:24:50
PETER LEVINE Hmm. 

00:24:50
SUE Yours sparkling too, it's wonderful to be held with that. 

00:24:55
PETER LEVINE Yeah, it takes one to know why. Yeah. Okay. What I like to have you do now is I know the lights are bright but maybe just look around a little bit in front here and just notice some of the colors, the shapes, the hair, the faces and just see if you can draw them in through you eyes. 

00:25:35
SUE Hmm. 

00:25:35
PETER LEVINE You know, like magnets take an iron-filings, just use your eyes to draw their faces, their bodies into you. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:55
SUE That was lovely. 

00:25:55
PETER LEVINE Lovely. 

00:25:55
SUE Yeah. 

00:25:55
PETER LEVINE Yeah. Yeah, good. So I don't know-- and obviously there are lot of other stuff here but I think this was the one and in, in-- when you're doing a therapy session like this, you will get to that one piece that's ready to be worked on. And it's important not to use our idea of what that is. And I think so often as therapist we do that. We really have to trust the wisdom of the organism. The wisdom of the person's the body, mind, spirit, soul to find their path not just to their memory but to - 

00:26:40
SUE Hmm. 

00:26:40
PETER LEVINE - being more alive, more embodied. 

00:26:40
SUE Yeah. 

00:26:45
PETER LEVINE Yeah. So, I guess, I don't know, do we, do we take questions here in this kind of a format? Uhm, ah, can somebody give me information on that. 

00:27:00
SUE I think you can. It's your session, you got to do what you wanna do. 

00:27:00
PETER LEVINE Oh, well. It's great. It's wonderful. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I-- I'm-- I don't know if we have a microphone or that's the only. Oh, there it is. Oh, okay. Ha-- are you okay with that? 

00:27:20
SUE Hmm. 

00:27:20
PETER LEVINE Okay, and you can ask either of us and either of us-- both of us has the option to not answer your question. Okay. Don't mean to scare you of. So, if you have a question or an observation. 

00:27:35
 Yeah, I have a question. I'm over here. Uhm, I noticed at the end you looked at her with this intense, uhm, I was wondering what was going on in you during that moment. 

00:27:50
PETER LEVINE I was feeling intense joy. Absolutely. Is this-- is one of those now moments when we crest the wave crest we come to being of being alive and real, and in contact. Yeah. 

00:28:10
SUE Uhm, Peter. Sorry, I'm over this side. 

00:28:15
PETER LEVINE Okay. 

00:28:15
 Uhm. 

00:28:15
PETER LEVINE All right, great. 

00:28:20
 Uhm, I'm just wondering if, uhm, if Sue(ph) you know, if you sort of seeing someone who in that si-- in the situation of loss of a parent that, ah, than been incest there. What would you do, sort of you know, would you still go to some fun-- those good memories and... 

00:28:35
PETER LEVINE You mean, oh, I see what you say. You mean hypothetically. 

00:28:40
 Yes. Yes. 

00:28:40
PETER LEVINE Yeah, if there's incest. Incest is, ah, a sacred wound cuz it wounds the soul in a particular way. And I'm very cautious of how to go there, where we go. Generally, we don't go there right away. We go with here and now. And until the person is able-- this is, ah, ah, ah, another thing that I think is mistake that's often made and therapy in working with memories. Is, if the person is in an unsettle state in themselves in agitated state, in, in the present. So if the client comes in and they're in tremendous amount distress. And the therapist thinks, okay, well this is maybe related to the incest or whatever or something else. And then they have them recover that memory. Well, what happens is the feeling of distress, those specific somatic markers will engage a memory with similar somatic markers. But the, the agitation then will evoke more agitation which will then feedback in present to greater agitation and so you build up this positive feedback with negative consequences. And you go down the rabbit hole, you go into the vortex, into the whirlpool. So until the-- it's the first thing and I think you saw it in the beginning of the session, we got to a place where Sue(ph) was feeling relatively solid in himsel-- in herself that her constriction was lesser capacity to feel things with greater. I could see that clearly in, in your body. There was much more space, it weren't like this. There was more open. And then we have place-- then we have room to make other explorations. Okay, I hope that at least it give some guidelines. 

00:30:35
 So I guess that's where you go if there's paralysis... 

00:30:40
PETER LEVINE But... 

00:30:40
 So that's you'd go if to start with-- if there's body paralysis, uhm... 

00:30:45
PETER LEVINE And getting movement there, getting alive is there. 

00:30:50
SUE Right. 

00:30:50
 Thank you. 

00:30:50
PETER LEVINE And there was at the end sensation, this, this movement of welcoming the legs back into the body. Again, I was gonna interpret that. I was simply gonna let it be and notice what happens next or in the next session. All right. Okay. 

00:31:05
 Thank you. 

00:31:05
PETER LEVINE So let's go centers-- center stage, yeah. 

00:31:10
 So, a quick question. It appeared externally observing you, you were able to very quickly propriocept-- and he was very quickly able to almost inductively bring you into your body. My question kinda for both of you is how typical or atypical would that be because my experience has been clinically that you know, you were perfect for this demonstration but how much my body work have you done today because you were able to go there really, really fast. 

00:31:40
PETER LEVINE You could, ah, ah-- I'll let you answer it. But I, I would say one thing is that as a experiment, I have worked everywhere in the world. I have worked with every kind of population, cowboys to Indians, truck drivers to cowboys. I mean really, road riders. And, in many ways, many ways, always, I found that sometimes actually people who have never had any experience they're able to more go in their body. It's a surprising that you know, they say adolescence you cannot work with adolescence because they can't get in their bodies. I said, what adolescence do you-- are you working with? Because the adolescence that I know and work with, they, they love it when they get in there. And they, they can really se-- see what's going on inside of them. So, I don't think it's an issue but... 

00:32:30
SUE Yeah, so I've done a lot of body work and I do a lot of work like this with my clients and I find that almost everybody can do it easily. You know, and maybe that they have to do it in small bites. 

00:32:45
 Right. 

00:32:50
SUE But the only-- actually the only people who don't do it easily are the ones that have come in and tell their story and all they gonna do is tell their story. 

00:32:55
PETER LEVINE Right. But, again, even there, you have to be smart. So you listen to the story. You get some part of that story that grabs you. You let yourself be grabbed. And you say, "Oh, wa-- when you tell me about that, you know, I notice this in my body." I was wondering if you noticed anything like that in your body. So you-- so you kinda coax them down. Somebody once said, "Well, what happens you--" re-- you well-- somebody ask question. What happens when you-- if you bumped into a person resistance. And the person, "Oh, you say excuse me." All right. 

00:33:35
 Thank you both. 

00:33:35
PETER LEVINE Sure. 

00:33:40
 I have a question related to the, to the boundaries issues. 

00:33:45
PETER LEVINE To the what issues? 

00:33:45
 Boundaries. 

00:33:45
PETER LEVINE Boundaries. 

00:33:45
 Well, you know, you touch some of her body parts - 

00:33:50
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:33:50
 - and the, ah, I'm just wondering what is your feedback about that-- about that, you're not exposing yourself and how, how much you'll with touching the body parts? 

00:34:00
PETER LEVINE Yes, you know, I'll tell you something. That question has come up a lot. And because you know, our training in the last-- the third, ah, last year of our training we do introduce touching that people who don't wanna use it in their practice is of course don't but it's very useful to increase the sensitivity of ones perception and it's very deep in the, the clients experience. So we work for two years with the man named (inaudible ) you may have heard of him. (inaudible ) and he is one of the leading ethics people at the APA, American Psych Association and we consult it with him for two years. And really, ah, discussed the ethical use of touch. And one of the important things of course is respect of boundaries and using it appropriately at the right time, having a reason a for doing it. And in it way-- at one time in California it was completely unethical to ever touch any client at all if you were, if you were psych-- psychologist. And I would hope that in this new century that we'll come to the point where it's really unethical not good practice to not offer the hand when somebody needs that help then, have through with their feelings. 

00:35:20
[sil.] 

00:35:25
PETER LEVINE And one my friends, one of my colleagues, ah, is, ah, is, ah, ah, Victor Yalom with psychotherapy.net. And I was watching a video of Sue, ah, Johnson working and she was touching, if she was with the couple. She had her hand on the woman's leg several times. And I said, "Oh, that's my kind of gal." I mean, obviously again, ah, male touching a female that way that's not something you would be doing. Again, unless you we're doing some specific body f-- working a specific type of trauma and so forth. So, there's something you have to be really, really careful about but I, I think things are changing now that paranoia is less and I think a lot of it comes because I teach all over the world. And I want to tell you something. This culture is touch deprive to a pathological degree. And I think that a lot of this is coming from our fear of our own deprivation. And sometimes the correct usage touch can actually catalyze healing of that. Yeah. Okay, ah... 

00:36:50
 Hello. 

00:36:50
PETER LEVINE Hi. 

00:36:50
 Thank-- thank you both for that demonstration, that was wonderful. And Sue(ph) thank you for doing that in front of all these people. Uhm, if you don't mind, I wonder if you could share how you feel physically in your body compared to-- oops! Compared to 40 minutes ago before you did that. 

00:37:10
SUE Ah, I feel much more relaxed, more spacious, ah, quieter. So, hugely different. 

00:37:20
PETER LEVINE Yeah, and, and in wa-- and you said the thing you wanted to find is fluidity and less constriction. 

00:37:25
SUE Uh-hmm. 

00:37:30
PETER LEVINE So it looks like we had the jackpot. And I always will ask the person-- not always, always but most always what they would like to have happen, what they would like to see happen. And then I'll check back at the end, did it happened? So thank you for asking the question. So I guess we're over to this side now. Oh, here. 

00:37:50
 Uhm, I have a two part question. I worked in a IOP for substance abuse with adults and adolescence. 

00:37:55
PETER LEVINE Uh-hmm. 

00:38:00
 We do, do individual sessions but a lot of our work is done in groups. 

00:38:00
PETER LEVINE Uh-hmm. 

00:38:00
 So I'm curious about, uhm, the translatability to this in a group setting. 

00:38:05
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:38:05
 If possible and also s-- uhm, you kinda touch on a little already but with the adolescent population. 

00:38:10
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:38:10
 We started to work a little bit of mindfulness into the groups. 

00:38:15
PETER LEVINE Group. 

00:38:15
 Ah, much-- I feel like this is just that much more above mindfulness. Uhm... 

00:38:20
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:38:20
 And, but we do see a problem with them finding feeling or emotion words - 

00:38:25
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:38:30
 - ah, as she was so easily able to do with her body. 

00:38:30
PETER LEVINE Right. 

00:38:30
 So, I was just wondering if you change the language at all with them or make it - 

00:38:35
PETER LEVINE With, with adolescence. 

00:38:35
 - with adolescence. If you have to coach them a little bit more, uhm, you know, being into a person. 

00:38:40
PETER LEVINE Oh, yeah, I find it-- first of all what they like to do. What hangout-- ah, well, what do you do when you hangout. I don't know, we smoke, we... 

00:38:50
 Uh-hmm. 

00:38:55
PETER LEVINE Oh, okay, okay, oh, that's interesting. Well, tell me about what it's like cuz I haven't smoke for a while. I did it a long time ago. I haven't smoke for a while. What's it like smoke weed? And then they say, "I can talk to people. I'm not as-- I'm not as uptight. I feel more whatever, stronger, and less frightened." And I said, "Okay, I got you." Would you be interested in learning how to do this without dope? And, and, it-- being a teenager, they might then say, "Well, I don't why." I mean, I can always get go-- it's almost legal now. And I said, "Okay. Good point, well taken." How could we decide which would be better? And then I'll turn and the kid will say, "Let's try both." Well, since you've already tried the dope, let's try the other way. And we do some work and they're feeling this flow and connection, and power in their bodies, kids who are into sports of course, that's a great place to start. So, yeah, I mean, it's like anybody find where they are, what is meaningful for them, what works for them? And meet them there. And, and an addiction of course is, is, is, ah, is it's own complicated thing. I consult with the meadows and, and, and, and you know, and therefore of course work quite a bit with addiction. And but I think in, in-- somebody I think it was also making boundaries talking about research that shows that the only programs that really the work the best are those are integrative. So you're working with the substance, you're working with the emotion, you're working of course with the self-regulation and that's where body therapy has its most power I think is in-- in self-regulation. And you-- I think inward just you know, demonstrating that. Yeah, okay. 

00:41:00
PETER LEVINE Then, so how about the translatability to the group peace? Are you able to do this in a group setting? 

00:41:05
PETER LEVINE Yes. Oh, group settings. I've worked in group-- yes, indeed. 

00:41:05
 Okay. 

00:41:10
PETER LEVINE Indeed, indeed. 

00:41:10
 Thank you. 

00:41:10
PETER LEVINE Yeah, I have worked in group settings. Yeah. 

00:41:15
 Uhm, one I thing I noticed that you did a lot when she was sharing her sen-- body sensations as you're saying that's perfect or that's great. 

00:41:20
PETER LEVINE Uh-hmm. 

00:41:20
 And just curious about that, just in terms of how it's kinda judging there-- you know, experience and just your use of that or why you do that. 

00:41:30
PETER LEVINE Okay, so why do say that's great or that's it or, uh-huh, that's it. Wow! Okay, try saying that when nothing is happening. Or they're going in, ah, some, ah, a difficult but a constricted place. It's just giving quick feedback to what I've been able to attract in the client. You see, and so if I say, "Did you notice that? Your shoulders were letting go and..." Okay, now, isn't this a little bit par-- parsimonious. That's it. You see, because other-- the other takes them up in their head. But that's it. Oh, okay, that's what, that's what it is. 

00:42:25
SUE Okay, and that's and-- I've been entrained with that so-- because my shoulders just went down as he said that. 

00:42:30
PETER LEVINE Ah, right. Yeah. 

00:42:35
 Uhm, when population-- I'm getting a little stuck with in doing body work as with some transgender clans. 

00:42:45
PETER LEVINE Ah-huh. 

00:42:45
 I found that, uhm, they have said things like, "I don't feel safe in body." 

00:42:50
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:42:50
 Uhm, "I don't feel comfortable in my body-- I don't belong in my body." 

00:42:50
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:42:50
 Uhm, so I'm wondering if you have any ideas about how to get around that or how to work with them in a body-centered way. 

00:43:00
PETER LEVINE That's a real-- really beautiful question, I really appreciate it. And you re-- touch me. And it started me to think. I haven't work with any. Uhm, what I was working in Berkeley. I mean, that was the beginning where people were a lesbian or gay. It was the very, very beginning when people are starting to come out. But I think one of the things I would examine and see if they wanted to examine what's-- how they feel not right in their body, not safe in their body. And I wouldn't go anywhere with you know, trying to dissuade them or support that for doing it. But to at least that initially but to just see why it is that they're uncomfortable with. And I think that would give them even more self-knowledge and self-compassion to go in their direction that they're going. So, uhm, I, I would like sometime to work with and people from that, that population. And like all my clients, I really learn from them. You know, my work with children and infants, I learn from children and infants. 

00:44:20
 Thank you. 

00:44:20
PETER LEVINE Yeah, yeah, thank you. 

00:44:25
 Hi. My question is about the sound work that you did, ah, especially in terms of the vo and you related it to the foghorn. Was that specifically of the boats theme? And the second part... 

00:44:35
PETER LEVINE Because of the what? 

00:44:40
 Oh, becau-- did-- was that tying to the boat theme because... 

00:44:40
PETER LEVINE The boat. 

00:44:40
PETER LEVINE With the yeah, with the sea. 

00:44:40
PETER LEVINE Yes. 

00:44:40
 Do you use different types of sound, and also it sounded very much like what you would do with the Om in meditation - 

00:44:50
PETER LEVINE Right. 

00:44:50
 - or it Kundalini yoga type chanting. 

00:44:50
PETER LEVINE It was multiple. One, not the first one but one was to also know that, that would be very likely red-- resonating with the father. And but in a way that wouldn't evoke it directly. Ah, but also is the, the ide-- image of coming into safe harbor. 

00:45:10
 Uh-hmm. 

00:45:10
PETER LEVINE When a person does and feel safe. Now, I'm gonna give you first a, kind of a technical way of looking at this. There is-- I, I talked before about, well, trauma is something that happens in the body. We stiff and we retract and fear we collapse into helplessness. And so until that changes, that signal is still send to the brain, and it tells the brain that there is threat-- threats though exist and that's why the person stays in a ra-- hyper-arousal state or in a shutdown numb state. There's a nerve in the body, it's called vagus nerve, it's the largest nerve in the entire body. And it connects the brain with the heart, the brain with got-- the ha-- the heart with the gut, the heart-- the gut with the heart. And this nerve has hundreds of thousands of fibers. And, ah, if we think something horrible, we, we get upset in our tummy, right? So that's the brain sending impulses down to the gut. But that nerve, 80 to 90% is afferent that means it's signaling fr-- impulses from the gut to the brain. And so when the person in, ah, a loop where they're getting the stress from their gut and it goes to the brain and that brain then gives more distress, again we talked about this positive feedback loops with negative consequences. I talk a lot about this in my, in my, in my book in a non-spoken voice. So I really recommend that and really look at that whole, whole business here. So what you're doing is sending new signals from the gut vibrating it from the gut vo, try in. Voooooo. Uhm, all right, you feel the vibration. Okay, and it's different than Om. Om is much more here. Excuse me here and there. Oh, yes. Also these things have been around for thousands of years. 

00:47:35
 Right, right. 

00:47:35
PETER LEVINE Let's talk about you know, what do they say, ah, evidence-based. The original evidence-based okay. 

00:47:45
 Thank you. 

00:47:45
PETER LEVINE Okay, I don't know what time it is. 

00:47:45
SUE We have 10 more more minutes. 

00:47:45
PETER LEVINE Ten more minutes, okay, good cuz I have another thing after that so I don't wanna get. Ah... 

00:47:55
 Hi, Dr Levine, you'd talked about some things the body tells a different story than the person does. 

00:48:00
PETER LEVINE But then the mind then you know... 

00:48:00
 Then the mind does. And I'm wondering how do you use this approach with small children and any-- and infants as well. 

00:48:05
PETER LEVINE Oh. Well, infants show everything in their body. I was recently working with a baby who was born with a cords three times around its neck. It was in, ah, ah, acute asphyxiation, ah, they did of course an emergency caesarian but the, the baby was breached and he was far a wedge into apex on the uterus that they couldn't even get the mouth and they have to suction him. And he was develop-- he had developed some severe symptoms of a gastric reflux in which they were talking about doing variant phase of procedures. And so I immediately so-- ah, somebody knew if, ah, he, he's-- friend of his mother knew of my work and brought him in and again when they took them out, he had always tubes and everything around him. We made contact with some ravel first, getting in a rhythmic relation flow again. And then I handed him the, the ravel and he reached out for the ravel and then pulled away. He was curious but then pulled away. So then I, I stayed there with it again and he reached out his hand and this time he pushed it away. And I said, "Jack, that's great. You can push it away. Yes, push as much as you want." And then he reached that again, took it and then push the way. And these things just continued to play out and then, ah, I, I, I was able to put my hand on his upper back cuz I could that's where his breath got caught. And his breath through and he immediately-- ah, before that. And when I put my hand there, his feet pushed away and you could see his whole body going into the birth movement that got toward it. And he was able to complete it. And then there was this deep, deep, deep crying. He never bonded and he just molded into his mom. Molded into her arms. And the mother had tears and coming to say, "I'm-- he's never cried. I've never seen a tear. This is my baby. I mean, I, I now know this ba-- it's my baby." And he just continued to get as much molding. The first day, he, he, he came into the room, he came up to his mother, climb in bed and molded with her. So, follow, follow the-- yeah. 

00:50:45
 Thank you, what a gift, thank you. 

00:50:45
PETER LEVINE Okay, I have a question... 

00:50:50
PETER LEVINE Here, over here, yes. 

00:50:50
 Uhm, for people who struggle to feel their bodies and to really live inside their body and who are more stuck inside their head. 

00:51:00
PETER LEVINE Uh-hmm. 

00:51:00
 Uhm, how it like, for example psychoanalytical or like talk therapy, how would you recommend integrating, uhm, like head work with body works so that you can do both of those together and recognize the importance of both. 

00:51:10
PETER LEVINE Yeah, actually we have a lot of analyst you know, or trainings, ah, especially in the New York trainings and the LA trainings and San Francisco training cuz I don't wanna-- uhm, I think they go together beautifully. Ah, I, I wa-- I, I do a lot of-- I, I, I spend my summers in Switzerland and I'm in Zurich fair amount of the time and went in Rome or went in Zurich. I, I'm working with a union analyst. He's in his 80s and its wonderful for me, I love it. It really is ma-- the highlight of my summer ma-- my summer work there. And one time I ask him, I said, "Dr. Rivey(ph), what happens when people don't get this in their bodies?" And he looked at me and he said, "It takes a long time." So, I think they go together. I think they really do. I, I, I-- as a lot about the analytic stance, I think it's tremendously valuable. And I, I think the body together. There's a picture that I show so-- I will show it tomorrow, uhm, with the man with his foot is up here, his arm is down there and his you know, everything is all twisted, and he's laying on the couch there. And the analyst just taking notes and he said, he says, "Don't worry, ah, Mr. Fentin(ph) we'll soon have this all sorted out." While you won't when the person is in a fragmented state, talk won't make a change. But dynamic therapy to me is a, is a, is a marriage of bottom-up sensory motor processing and in-- and inside and everything that are-- the other things that, that are you know, brought out in the analytic, ah, process. 

00:53:15
 Thank you so much. 

00:53:15
PETER LEVINE Sure. 

00:53:15
 Yes, ah. 

00:53:20
PETER LEVINE One more. 

00:53:20
 Yes, Dr. Levine I wanted to ask, uhm, some of the-- to get your suggestions on what I can read and listen to concerning, uhm, a client that I'm working with has, uhm, it's a neuropathic pain. I believe it's a pain upon known origin she has this extreme pain around her knees. 

00:53:40
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:53:40
 And all there around both knees and, and elsewhere in her body where she's, she's started to feel like those molten-iron being poured out these areas. 

00:53:50
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:53:50
 I've done some-- I've done a lot of humanistic, cognitive behavioral - 

00:53:55
PETER LEVINE Yeah. 

00:53:55
 - therapy with her and, uhm, Erickson and hypnosis and the, uhm, these as her depression and anxiety has gone down, and the pain has been lessened considerably. But-- ho-- how can I add your approach - 

00:54:10
PETER LEVINE Oh, yeah. 

00:54:10
 - and what can I read and listen to also? 

00:54:10
PETER LEVINE Yeah, sure gladly. Uhm, yeah, ah, actually one form dissociation is what we call somatic dissociation. I think my, my, my dear friend Bob, ah, scared cuz it's somatic dissociation. 

00:54:25
 Uh-huh. 

00:54:25
PETER LEVINE Where basically, the part of the body that dissociated plays out, the theater of the body plays out in these weird symptoms. I'm actually working on a project because introitus and family docs, primary care docs see a lot of people between 50 and 80% of their patients come up with these symptoms that don't make sense. 

00:54:50
 Well. 

00:54:50
PETER LEVINE And, ah, and I don't know. I mean, of course you always want to get full examination - 

00:54:55
 Uh-huh. 

00:54:55
PETER LEVINE - and the neurologist you know, you wanna really look for any possible organic sources - 

00:55:00
 But... 

00:55:00
PETER LEVINE - but again, in a large-- I think it's well over 50% nothing has ever found. 

00:55:05
 Right. 

00:55:10
PETER LEVINE And it's these kind of things, I do begin to address them in my book in a non-spoken voice - 

00:55:15
 Uh-huh. 

00:55:15
PETER LEVINE - ah, for sure and I'm working on a book now, ah, on trauma and memory. I'm looking at these as procedural memories - 

00:55:25
 Well. 

00:55:25
PETER LEVINE - in the body. 

00:55:25
 Uh-huh. 

00:55:25
PETER LEVINE So, ah, you know, ah, if the person can get in contact with the sensations that are underneath the pain, that can make a big a difference. Also, I did a book with Maggie Phillips whose is, ah, does a lot of work with the hypnosis and, ah, and energy psychology and so forth. We did-- recall Freedom from Pain I-- they probably have it in the book store. And there are a lot of exercises and approaches to work specifically with different kinds of pain including neuro. I believe we have a section on neuropathic pain. 

00:55:55
 Oh, okay. 

00:56:00
PETER LEVINE Glad, okay, well, thank, ah, you all. 

00:56:00
 Thank you. 

00:56:05
PETER LEVINE Dear.
