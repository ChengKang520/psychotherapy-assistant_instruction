VIKTOR FRANKL Mr. Chairman, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen. First of all, at my age of more than 81, I have to express my appreciation for the privilege to remain seated during my presentation. Now, as you might have noticed, the title for this, my presentation, has been different.

VIKTOR FRANKL The title for this, my presentation, has been different in the individual versions at, at (inaudible ) times of the program. In French, in English, in German. In as much as sometimes the title write the meaning of life while the other versions the title read the meaning of love. Well, the first title is the correct one. Now to the reason. That unless life in general had a meaning, love in particular could not be meaningful and the same also goes for procreation. Unless life itself per se were something meaningful, it would not make sense to perpetuate, to procreate our life. But it is the very problem of our times that people are taught by a pervasive feeling of meaninglessness, a feeling which is morose per conspicuous symptom in or better to say the collective neurosis of our time. It is usually accompanied by a feeling of emptiness and since I described and denoted it as the essential vacuum in 1955, this feeling of emptiness has increased and spread literally all over the world. Our industrial society is out to satisfy all needs and our consumer society is even out to create needs in order to satisfy them. But the most human of all human needs, the need to see a meaning in our lives has remained dissatisfied. People may have enough to live by but more often than not, they do not have anything to live for. This is most perceptible in the young generation. More specifically in the form of a mass neurotic syndrome consisting of depression, aggression, and addiction. There is ample empirical evidence to the effect that suicide proneness, violent behavior, and drug dependency are in fact due to a lack or loss of meaning. Now how can we cope with this malaise and frustration of our time? Well, whenever we want to overcome a frustration, we must first understand the underlying motivation, the original motivation that has been frustrated. So let us have a look at what the motivational theories of the great psycho-therapeutic schools and systems teach us. According to Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis, human behavior is ruled by a pleasure principle and according to Alfred Addler's (ph) in the literal psychology, man is dominated by a striving for superiority but upon closer scrutiny, it turns out that the pleasure principle ultimately serves the purpose of maintaining or restoring an inner equilibrium that is a state without tensions. Thus reads Freud's explicit contention and according to Alfred Addler's conviction all human beings are originally suffering from an inferiority complex and throughout their lives, aspiring to its compensation or overcompensation by obtaining a powerful position. As you see, however, both motivation theories depict man as a being basically concerned with inter-psychic conditions, be it an equilibrium or a feeling of inferiority versus a feeling of superiority but ladies and gentlemen, this is not a true picture of man. Actually, being human always means reaching out beyond one's self, reaching out for something other than one's self. For something or for someone. For a meaning to fulfill out there in the world or for another human being to love out there in the world but not being concerned with inner conditions solely. In other words, being human always means transcending one's self and unless this self transcendent quality of the human reality is recognized, psychology it generates into some sort of (inaudible ). In a word, self transcendence I regard to be the essence of existence but what about, but what about self actualization? It certainly is a perfectly worthwhile thing. In the final analysis, however, it turns out that we can arrive at self actualization only via self transcendence and in his personal diaries that have been published, even Abraham Meslow (ph), who made the concept of self actualization the cornerstone of his psychology of being. Meslow states that I had convinced him, literally quoting, convinced him that self actualization in fact is a mere by product, a side effect of self transcendence and the same, ladies and gentlemen, holds for pleasure and happiness. Pursuit of happiness as it is preached in the American Declaration of Independence is, as I see it, a sheer contradiction in terms because happiness cannot be pursued but must ensure. That is to say it must establish itself by itself, automatically, as the unintentional effect of our dedication and devotion to a cause to serve, something higher than ourselves or a person to love. A being other than ourselves. On the other hand, in a direct intention of pleasure accompanied by a superfluous, a high amount of attention paid to it, any direct intentional pleasure proves to be self defeating as easily can be shown in cases of sexual neurosis. The more a male patient tries to demonstrate his potency, the ore likely he will wind up with impotence and the more a female patient tries to convince herself that she's fully capable of experiencing orgasm the more she's liable to frigidity. The cure to (inaudible ) then lies in forgetting one's self by giving one's self. Now.

VIKTOR FRANKL But now, ladies and gentlemen, let's come back to the issue of meaning. I hope I could show you that man's basic concern is neither the will to power nor a will to pleasure but by what I'm used to calling the will to meaning. Man's search for meaning, precisely that which is so much been frustrated today, but man needs not only meaning but also something else. He needs the example and model of people who have fulfilled the meaning of their lives or at least are on the way to do so and this is precisely the moment at which the issue of the family comes in. For I regard the family as a life long opportunity to watch and witness what it means to fulfill meaning in life by living for others or better to say by living for each other. The family indeed is an arena where mutual self transcendence is enacted. By, by and large, family life is initiated by love or at least by what is misnamed love, while it really is no more than mutual sexual attraction. This brings up the question what is the relation between love and sex. More specifically, human sex. Well as far as human sex is concerned, it is truly human to the extent to which it serves as the expression of something meta-sexual and that is love. In other words, human sex is always more than mere sex and it is so to the extent to which it functions as the physical expression of love or, let me say as the incarnation of love. However, human sex cannot be a priority, a priority human. It can only become human step by step and it does so by ever more becoming self transcendent. Thus every more participating in the intrinsic self transcendence of all human, truly human phenomena. So let's have a look at the development of stages of the psychosexual maturation. First, there is only an interest in what Albert Mole (ph) once called the tumescence. That is the decrease of tension, that tension which is aroused by the sex drive. There is still no relation whatsoever to any partner so that we may say that in order to get rid of one's sexual tension, in principle, masturbation would do. Anyway, the goal, the goal of sexual activity in the first stage, on the first step is tension reduction as it is called in psychology. However, according to a distinction introduced by Sigmund Freud, drives not only have a goal but also an object as you see on the second step. In the case of sexuality, the object is represented by a partner but the partner is here still seen and used as a mere tool, as a tool to satisfy one's own sex drive and as a mere tool, the partner is interchangeable, a fact that results in promiscuity or even worse, the partner is merely anonymous as it is the case, for instance, with prostitutes. Yet such a relationship still lacks the human characteristic of safe transcendence is laid bare whenever those of our patients who suffer from sexual neurosis use the phrase masturbating on a woman. Only on the third stage of development, on the third step of maturation, the sub-human type of sexual activity is overcome because now the partner is no longer seen and used as an object but regarded as a subject, seen as a human being and this fact precludes being made a mere tool of drive satisfaction. Let us not forget that there is a less well known version of the, of (inaudible ) famous categorical imperative and it reads as follows. A human being must never be taken as a mere means to an end but the highest level of our scale is reached where the partner is not only seen in his or her humanness but in addition, in his or her uniqueness. That uniqueness which once called (inaudible ), the, uh, medieval, uh, scholastic philosopher in his system, it was called (inaudible ). The unique singularity of a being. Now, this uniqueness, this (inaudible ), constitutes a person, not just any human being, a person as an incomparable being, as a really unique being and only now we have entered the domain of love because it is love alone which empowers us for getting hold of the uniqueness of another human being and since the loving person alone is enabled to grasp the loved person as someone incomparable and hence irreplaceable, love is the supreme warrant of a monogamous relationship which in turn is the guarantee of it's own durability. Ladies and gentlemen, at the outset, we spoke of the meaning of love and the meaning of life. Love is certainly one way to meaning but it is not the only way. In other words, it is no way a (inaudible ). It is in no way an indispensable prerequisite for finding meaning in life and the same holds for procreation. There is an old Chinese dictum according to which a man in the course of his life should have written a book, beset a son, and planted a tree. Well, what about myself? I've over 27 books but, alas, I have beset only a daughter rather than a son and to make it worse, I have never in my life planted a tree. Should I have lived in vain? Should the meaning of life really be dependent on whether or not one is married and has children? How poor would life would be if this were true. For actually life is infinitely rich as to the possibilities to fill it with meaning because contrary to what the feeling of meaningless whispers into our ears, life is even unconditionally meaningful and that is to say that life holds the meaning for each and every person and that each and every condition literally up to the last moment of life, to the last breath of ourselves and that each and every condition in this means, including misery and tragedy or could you otherwise understand and explain that life still can be found and made meaningful if you have been married but have lost your spouse. Or if you have had children but then have lost them. Let me, for the sake of those among you, ladies and gentlemen to whom such a possibility sounds unbelievable, let me recall and invoke the following two dialogs. Once an old practitioner, general practitioner, showed up in my office. He was severe, severely depressed after his wife, whom he had loved above all else, had died. What should I have said to him? He told me himself that he knew that I cannot offer him any help and any medication he could have prescribed himself by himself. So what should I have said to him? Well, I didn't say but asked him a question. Doctor, what would have happened if not your wife but yourself had died first? Oh, he answered, how terrible this would have been for her. "How much she would have suffered." Well, I reacted, you see doctor, this suffering your wife has been spared and, after all, it is you, doctor, who have spared her this suffering. But now you have, done so, that you have done so, you have done so at the price that now you have to mourn her. At that moment, the suffering of this colleague was bestowed with a meaning, with the meaning of a sacrifice that he owed to his wife. And believe me, despair ceases, stops to be despair at the moment that suffering has got a meaning, someone for whose sake to suffer. And now the other dialog which I am going to, going to quote from a book authored by the German Bishop Gaylord Moser (ph). I'm not quoting literally from Moser's book. A few years after World War II, a doctor examined a Jewish woman. She wore a bracelet made of baby teeth mounted in gold. A beautiful bracelet, the doctor remarked. Yes, the woman answered. You see doctor, this tooth here belonged to Miriam. This one to Esther and this one to Samuel. And she mentioned the names of her daughters and sons according to age. Nine children she added and all of them were taken to the gas chambers. Shocked, the doctor asked how can you live with such a bracelet? Quietly, the woman replied, "I'm now in charge of an orphanage in Israel." Ladies and gentlemen, the widowed doctor had lost his wife. The Jewish mother had lost her children but as it is said in the song of songs, love is as strong as death. Thank you.
