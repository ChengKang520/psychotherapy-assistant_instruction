VIKTOR FRANKL Those prisoners have the highest chance of survival. Who where (inaudible) took on a meaning and wait for them, as it were, or to be reunited with the loved persons after their liberation in the future. The search for meaning is what has become frustrated. People, our patients complain of this feeling of meaninglessness, of emptiness. Meaning can be found everywhere; in the smallest hut. On the other hand, you find people who are millionaires and the billionaires and they have no meaning. They kill themselves. Sometimes I am angry to myself. So angry that, for several days, I don't talk with myself. 

00:01:00
Alexander Vesely, M.A. filmmaker 

00:01:00
ALEXANDER VESELY Life is a quest for meaning. No single individual did more to amplify this idea worldwide, than my grandfather, Viktor Frankl. Hello. My name is Alexander Vesely and this is a personal work about my grandfather. I have often wondered, what is it about his life, his work and his presence that makes him so recognized and loved around the world? Was it his extraordinary intellect or his joyful quest for life? Was it the keen insight or the humorous twinkle in his eye? Many books have been written about my grandfather's work, the influence his logotherapy and existential analysis had in the fields of psychology and psychotherapy and his sufferings through the greatest tragedy of our time, the Holocaust. In his writings, among them his landmark book, 'Man's Search for Meaning,' he explained his theories in a simple and uncomplicated way; so that anyone could learn its most important lesson, that regardless of the circumstances, you can always discover meaning in life. Until now, little has been shared with the world about his unique and personal side, and the impact he had on those whose lives he touched. For over two years, I traveled around the world interviewing family, friends, and colleagues, to document their perspectives on my grandfather's life. What I found was that, from whatever corner of the world, he touched lives in important, deep and meaningful ways. Born in Vienna, Austria in 1905, in humble surroundings, he remained a simple man throughout his life. And he was curious, looking forward, never stagnating in the past. Come with me on this journey, as we watch and listen to his friends describe who Viktor Frankl really was.

Jay Levinson, Ph.D. psychologist, former assistant USIU/U.S.A. 

00:02:45
JAY LEVINSON I was the only one in his school, dressed in a suit and tie that day. Uh, I was petrified. I mean, I had read his books, and I knew who he was, and I couldn't believe, here I was, I was gonna be his graduate assistant. I was as nervous as I, as all get out. 

00:03:00
Haddon Klingberg Jr., Ph.D. psychologist, biographer/U.S.A. 

00:03:00
HADDON KLINGBERG I knew that Viktor and Elly were still both living, uh, in Vienna at the same place. Uh, but had not seen them for a very long time. And I thought, I'll try one time to get back to them, because I wanted to say thank you. 

00:03:10
Reuven Bulka, Ph.D. rabbi, author/Canada 

00:03:10
REUVEN BULKA But he warned me, he said, 'It's, I'm a very tight schedule. I'll have five minutes for you.' All right, I have five minutes. Fine. 

00:03:20
HADDON KLINGBERG He said, 'Ah, can you come to our home right now?' I said, 'Yes, I can do this.' So, I made my way down and up to their flat. 

00:03:25
REUVEN BULKA Five minutes turned out to be four hours. 

00:03:30
HADDON KLINGBERG And we were talking and laughing. 

00:03:30
JAY LEVINSON And then we taught the first class. I began a twenty year relationship with him. 

00:03:35
REUVEN BULKA That was the most lasting impression that, to this very day, I have of a person who valued his time, but then he spent it so liberally when it was for something that he felt was, if I can use that word, meaningful.

Toronto, Canada 1972 

00:04:20
VIKTOR FRANKL Really, what, 16%, 16% of these students, regarded the main goal and concern at life to make a lot of money; I'm quoting literally, 'make a lot of money'. And you know what the high-, top cash, the top category... We say 'category', ' category', what do you say? Category was among... Excuse me, but, uh, I know I am speaking in marvelous accent without the slightest English. Now... 

00:04:50
Athan Vlahos son of Father George Vlahos, Ph.D./U.S.A. 

00:04:50
ATHAN VLAHOS He had a marvelous sense of humor. And, um, I know that, uh, his relationship with my father, which was very special, allowed the two of them to go back and forth on different subjects. And it was almost comical to observe, because, uh, you wouldn't know if they were serious or if they were just having fun. And then, at the end, when they would start laughing then, as you were observing this interaction, you would say, 'Oh, they were just having fun the whole time!' 

00:05:25
REUVEN BULKA He didn't fit in to any conventional sens-, uh, sense into anything. Uh, how, how do you explain an individual who, uh, when you sit down with him, he takes a pen and he starts to doodle, and in five minutes, he's giving you a profile of yourself that's as, uh, as accurate as it comes, you know? 

00:05:45
HADDON KLINGBERG A genius with the simplest, the simplest of tastes and preferences. He was almost like a child. He had a worn out Ziploc bag. It was as worn out and soft as tissue paper, in which he kept his medicines. He liked the Ziploc bag because he could hold it up to the lights and see through it, to, to the bottles that were there. And I had brought a book, in a Ziploc bag, for someone who wanted his autograph. And I left the book in the Ziploc bag at Viktor's apartment, to pick up the next day after he had inscribed it. He gave back to book, but not the Ziploc bag. And I said, 'Where's the Ziploc bag?' And he said, 'Oh, I'm keeping this.' And he liked it, because it was a nice, new, clear, uh, Ziploc bag. And he refused to give it back to me, and had retired this old Ziploc bag. So, of course, when I came back to the States, I bought him a whole box of Ziploc bags and mailed those off to him. But he liked that so much. Again, an example of that simple, he didn't, he did, he didn't spend money on stuff, he didn't accumulate, and the littlest things would, would please him and delight him. A Ziploc bag. Come on?

VIKTOR FRANKL Forgive my contradicting a paragraph in the Declaration of Independence. You cannot pursue, uh, happiness, pursuit of happiness. You cannot pursue happiness, simply because happiness must happen. You must let happiness happen. You cannot strive directly for it. You can only fulfill a meaning or love another person and thereby becoming automatically happen, happiness and pleasure are by products, are side effects, but not the real goal, the actual goal of human strivings.

Jeffrey K. Zeig, Ph.D. director Milton H. Erickson Foundation/U.S.A. 

00:08:00
Alfred Adler founder of Individual Psychotherapy 

00:08:05
JEFFREY K. ZEIG We're having this wide-ranging discussion , and he's talking with me about his times with Adler, and how he was a protégé of Adler, and then didn't stand up for Adler at a meeting that they had at one of the, uh, coffeehouses, I believe; and how he was ex-, uh, ex-communicated, so to speak, from the coffeehouse culture. So, we're having these discussions, uh, about, and I, I turn to Elly over dinner, I turn to Mrs. Frankl and I say, 'You know, I, I'm so sorry. You must have heard these stories many times before.' And she says, 'Oh no, some of these stories I'm hearing for the first time.' And I, I realize that we're having this herculean struggle on this subterranean level. And as we're having dinner, I'm trying to make him feel good about who he is and he is working to make me feel good about who I am, and I'm good at this. And he has me out-classed. He's just so good at this.

Robert C. Barnes, Ph.D. Viktor Frankl Institute of Logotherapy/U.S.A. 

00:09:00
ROBERT C. BARNES He'd been blessed with a gifted mind. His spirit was very rich. He was an intensely humble human being. And he used those gifts, to enrich and help humanity.

Katharina Ratheiser, M.A. granddaughter/Austria 

00:09:30
KATHARINA RATHEISER O-Papa invented those two characters for us, Boff and Neboff (sp). Uh, there were plates by his feet and the blanket when we, when we, uh, slept over at our grandparents. Um, he, and we went to bed in the evening, he was already in his bed. And those, and his feet were Boff and Neboff and they were talking to each other, like comedians; one with a high pitched voice, high-pitched, and the other one with a very low voice. And, uh, one, but I don't, don't remember which one, was the wise guy and one was the stupid one. And the wise guy was explaining something to the stupid one and it was very funny. And he made up stories and dialogues and things. His humor was, uh, dry and sharp and very witty and very fast. And Anna is the same, Anna does that too. I think she inherited that and also the love of language. And writing and, and putting complex idea in one simple sentence.

"Man Alive", CBC 1977 

00:10:50
VIKTOR FRANKL There's certainly no one who is spared with unchangeable situations. Perhaps, for a couple of month, unemployment, and still life retains a meaning. What we need, you see, is not bread alone. And what the unemployed need, uh, is not welfare alone. They need a meaning. The meaning can be found everywhere, in the smallest hut. On the other hand, you find people who are millionaires and the billionaires and they have no meaning. They kill themselves. 

00:11:25
Franz Vesely, Ph.D. son-in-law, physicist/Austria 

00:11:25
FRANZ VESELY I like to remember the way in which he used the questions posed to him by interviewers, for his own purposes. And his purposes were always therapeutical. So, whatever the interviewer asked he would shortly answer, in half a sentence, that question, and then would elaborate and would really address the audience. He would do a, kind of, collective therapy in a few sentences. He would intersperse his statement with little items that would help someone out there who may have had some fear, some problem; something to encourage them, to make them change an attitude, or whatever. So, he, he talked, kind of, uh, over the shoulders of the interviewer. You know, this kind of thing from politicians, where you don't like it, because they want something from you. But he was always one to give, to give, uh, advice, to give help, to give encouragement. And I, I sometimes talked to him about it and he always smiled and talked about other things, but I knew his, that this was what he had in mind. 

00:12:50
JAY LEVINSON When I was a student, second year student, I think, or first year student, I guess, one of the things he did, and I found out he did this with a lot of his people who he thought were promising students, is he would bring you up to his office to open the mail with him. And when he opened the mail he, you would open the letter, you would read it to him, and then he would say, 'How would you respond?' And then you would discuss the response, and then you would write it up, and then, when I was there, I would type it up for him, but many times Elly did it too. And you could see the focus, you could see him thinking beyond the question into the meaning of the question, and where was this person going with this questioned? And when he answered it, he answered not only the question, but the whole intent and the whole final road of where the person was going. And it was, he was very, very, seriously, he took such pride in his work and he didn't want to be misunderstood and he was so precise in his writing. And yet, he had these complex things, as I've said, in these very simple ways. And that side of him, I don't think a lot of people see, because I would see him struggling at his desk, trying to think, looking down, trying to think, well, how do I want to say this, and, especially when he had to do it in English. It's my understanding, that English was his third language. He spoke Spanish, and he spoke German and English. And, uh, I think maybe his Spanish might have been third, I'm not sure. But, uh, it's still a second language. Now, as a typical American, I have no other languages but English. And, uh, when I used to see him he was thinking both in German and in English. But he would concentrate, he was so focused; it was almost, at times, like he was in a different place, okay? And then he would come out of it and start talking, you know. And nobody would say a word. Elly wouldn't say a word. I wouldn't say a word. You know, sometimes we, we thought, did he forget the question, you know? 

00:14:40

Ernest J. Nackord, Ph.D. pilot, psychologist/U.S.A. 

00:15:05
ERNEST J. NACKORD He has an American pilot's license and he was in his 70s when he got it, and that's no simple thing to accomplish. And he loved to fly and we got Dr. Frankl and put him in the cockpit in the left-hand seat, but his feet wouldn't reach the rudder pedals. We had to shove the cab seat all the way forward. He, he held me in great respect, which I didn't deserve, really, simply because I was a pilot in World War II. But what he went through, as you know, I wouldn't have traded places with him. So I wasn't a hero, he was the hero, but that's how he saw it. I said to him, "You know, Dr. Frankl, I've always been puzzled. I just don't understand." He had been talking a little about, uh, you know, the, the war and that kind of stuff. "I don't understand how in the world people could do what they do in a war time. We kill one another and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. (coughs) And I said, "it just seems to me," my answer all these years has been, "it seems to me, that man has a capacity to anesthetize his conscience and, therefore, he, so he does these weird things. He's anesthetized his conscience." And I believed that, until I talked with your grandfather and he said, "Oh, no," he said, "I would never teach that. You cannot anesthetize your conscience. What you can do, and what man is capable of, and what he does do is he anesthetizes himself against the voice of his conscience, but that conscience is always cooking." 

00:16:40
REUVEN BULKA He had a passion about logotherapy not being misunderstood. This is something that I saw in him all the time. Nothing bothered him more than people who, uh, would take a statement and, out of context, or would distort what logotherapy is, uh, and it bothered him because this really was his baby. 

00:17:05
WTAE-TV Pittsburgh, 1972 

00:17:05
UNKNOWN Now, this means that you have found the meaning of, the meaning to life, the meaning that a, a person should give to his own existence? 

00:17:15
VIKTOR FRANKL You see, we psychiatrists are not, uh, omniscient. We cannot know what the meaning of a particular life is. We are out to help our patients to rediscover the meaning in life. 

00:17:30
UNKNOWN Can, can we find meaning in any instance, in any case, a person who...(crosstalk) 

00:17:35
VIKTOR FRANKL Yes. 

00:17:35
UNKNOWN ...faces death imminently. 

00:17:35
VIKTOR FRANKL Certainly, because I'm not, uh, tiring of, uh, saying, uh, life can be meaningful or made meaningful, not only by doing a deed, by creating a work and beyond that by our experiencing something or by our encountering someone and, uh, to encounter him in his uniqueness means, by loving him. But even if we need be, whenever we are confronted with an unchangeable face, uh, fate. Whenever we have to face say an incurable disease, an inoperable cancer, even then, there is the highest meaning, uh, potential to realize, to fulfill. Because, then, precisely then, we are called upon to bear witness to the unique, human potential, which is to transmute, to turn a predicament into an achievement, a human accomplishment. Or to turn tragedy into a triumph. 

00:18:40
Katsutaro Nagata, M.D., Ph.D. logotherapist/Japan 

00:18:40
KATSUTARO NAGATA He was full of humor and, uh, he laughed well. And he could understand any person deeply, uh, to their spiritual level, the potential level he can understand very, in the short while, he can understand. Uh, he could make tuning in to me and, probably, to other patients. Uh, this is his, uh, power. I think so. 

00:19:10
Harald Mori, MSc. Psychotherapist/Austria 

00:19:10
HARALD MORI A friend of mine, Barbara, she was medical doctor, a young medical doctor, she was suffering from, uh, a common type of cancer, which was to be treated very well. Unfortunately, in the hospital where she was treated, the, the General Hospital of Vienna, an accident happened and she got the wrong injection. Uh, instead of, of, getting it in the vein, it was injected into her lumbaral, uh, region. And, uh, so she had to face a progressive paralyzes starting from the feet and, uh, going up until to her head, which, later on, led to a coma, uh, where she did not wake up from for the next three years. After then, she, uh, finally died. The most thing she appreciated was that he took his time with his 90 years and went up there. Uh, on the way home, when I went home with Professor Frankl, after the visit of Barbara, he told me the words of John Ruskin, the philosopher John Ruskin, and he said, uh, that there is only one honor in life and that is the honor to help someone and that there is only one might in the world, and that is the might or a power to save a person, to save a patient. So, uh, this dramatic situation, I could really witness myself that Viktor Frankl was living what he was writing. That he was acting as a man who was a doctor who had a soul.

00:21:05
JERRY LONG JR. Quite a change. 

00:21:05
PATRICIA L. STARCK Can you tell us a little bit about, uh, what transpired and why your goals changed? 

00:21:10
Jerry Long Jr., Ph.D. psychologist/U.S.A. 

00:21:15
JERRY LONG JR. Well, even prior to the injury, I had the, the mental capacity and the intellectual ability to do things other than physical work, but I did not tap into that. And when I broke my neck, I realized that to have a productive life, and to have a meaningful life, I would have to depend upon something other than my physical being. Because it was no longer there. And, as I've written, when I read his book I was overcome with a sense of déjà vu... 

00:21:40
PATRICIA L. STARCK Mm-hmm. 

00:21:40
VIKTOR FRANKL Mm-hmm. 

00:21:40
JERRY LONG JR. ...because several times, many times he spoke of reactions and the way he felt, and the way he interpreted his experiences in the concentration camps, and repeatedly were the times when I identified, personally. I felt the exact same way, when I lay in that hospital bed, as he did when he was in that concentration camp. And so, I wrote him a letter and much to my amazement, he wrote me back. Very, very applauding and very, very meaningful letter and, therein, began a relationship and a correspondence and a professional respect which has continued and mushroomed into today's events.

Jay Levinson, Ph.D. psychologist, former assistant USIU/U.S.A. 

00:22:15
"Unbroken Spirit" (J. Long 1982) 

00:22:15
JAY LEVINSON Jerry was a 18 year old, uh, high school student in Texas, who was a very talented baseball pitcher. And out of high school, he threw a baseball fast enough to earn himself a Major League tryout. Interestingly enough, he, uh, was recruited by the Houston Astros, a local baseball, uh, baseball team in Texas and was sent to the Minor League camp. Uh, while they were in the camp and they were, at night, you know, the players, they were all young kids, would go out and they'd do horse around. So, one night they were out and, um, they were swimming in a local aqueduct. And they were diving in. They moved over a few feet and Jerry dove in the water and about 3 inches below the water was a bunker, a cement bunker. He hit his head, broke his neck and was a quadriplegic for the rest of his life. Jerry read this book and it so applied to his, um, condition in life where he was this star coming out of high school and he thought he was gonna make a lot of money and be a professional athlete, which all young Americans aspire to be. And now he was a quadriplegic confined to wheelchair for the rest of his life, who couldn't move his, his hands very well. He could move from a little bit from here up, he had a little motion. He learned to type with a mouth stick and things like that. So he read the book and he wrote a letter to Dr. Frankl and he said in the letter that, you know, he had read his book. 'Man's Search for Meaning', and how it changed his life and he just wanted to thank him. 

00:23:40
ROBERT C. BARNES He went on to say 'You, Dr. Frankl', in the letter that this 19 year old wrote to Viktor Frankl, 'You, Dr. Frankl, were in prison. I am in prison'. Because, because of his physical condition. He couldn't feel or control anything from his neck down, but he added one more sentence, 'You have taught me that I am free'. 

00:24:10
PATRICIA L. STARCK Could you tell us how logotherapy helped to shape your attitude? 

00:24:15
JERRY LONG, JR. 

00:24:15
JERRY LONG, JR. I think that it's important to remember my attitude adoption and the logotherapy that I employed initially, was without any knowledge of logotherapy. I had not read any books and I had no acquaintance with it, but intuitively, I modified my attitude toward the situation. In one particular line that, that Dr. Frankl quotes fairly often 'I broke my neck. It didn't break me.' 

00:24:40
Toronto Youth Corps, 1972 

00:24:45
VIKTOR FRANKL If we seem to be idealists and are overestimating, overrating man and looking at him that high, here above, you know what happens? We promote him to what he really can be. So we have to be idealists, in a way, because then we wind up as the true, the real, realists. And you know who has said this? If we take man as he is, we make him worse, but if we take man as he should be, we make him capable of becoming what he can be. This was not my flight instructor, this was not me, this was Goethe. He said this verbally. And now you will understand why I, in one of my writings, once said this is the most apt maxim and motto for any psychotherapeutic activity. So if you don't recognize a young man's will to meaning, man's search for meaning, you make him worse, you make him dull, you make him frustrated, you still add and contribute to his frustration. Why, if you presuppose in this man, if in this so called criminal or juvenile delinquent or drug abuser and so forth, there must be a, a, what do you call, spark?, a spark of search for meaning. Let's recognize this. Let's presuppose it. And then, you will elicit it from him and you will make him become, what he, in principle, is capable of becoming.

00:26:25
REUVEN BULKA He was so protective of logotherapy, that it some, sometimes got him down, um, maybe a lit be overprotective, I'm not sure. It, it stood him well, but also could get him in, in, in into trouble. Cause he, sometimes if you're too quick to defend and you're too quick to, uh, to rise up in anger against something that you don't like. And maybe, there, there may be one or two times that he did, uh, lose his, his cool.

00:27:50
First edition of "Man's Search for Meaning", Austria 1946 

00:27:50
JAY LEVINSON And he was a very private person, a very shy person. Uh, for a man who was constantly in the st-, the spotlight, he didn't really like that. He, there were times when he didn't understand what the fuss was about. He'd be speaking to 2 or 3,000 people somewhere and he, and you could see he's like, you know, wh-, what do all these people want with me? You know? And people would walk up to him, I understand one time in Brazil, I think it was Brazil, he told me that when they came out of an elevator, people mobbed him so, that they literally ripped Elly's blouse off. And I'm think, and he couldn't understand that, he couldn't understand. I mean, he knew he had something important to say, and he wanted to say it, but he had no idea the impact it would have. Uh, I remember the story about when he wrote 'Man's Search for Meaning' in German the first time. And, forgive me, I don't know the German for it, uh, but the translation was 'From Death Camp to Existentialism'. And the first edition is published anonymously because he didn't think that he shouldn't get, in essence, fame or fortune for helping people with something that was such an important thing. And it wasn't until his friends and family said to him, 'Listen, people want to know who is saying this stuff. They, they need to know who to write to, who to contact, who to learn from,' that he reluctantly agreed to put his name on it. And, I think, after that he was, sort of, always uncomfortable in public because wherever he was, people were walking up to him. 

00:29:25
Michael Ascher, Ph.D. psychologist/U.S.A. 

00:29:25
MICHAEL ASCHER The chief proponent of logotherapy is Viktor Frankl. And his writings in the United States are accessible to all people, both professionals and the public. And that's a problem, because, uh, academics are a, um, snobbish group and he was very good at giving analogies, at making things understandable. That, that was his problem. He made things too understandable. Made things accessible to everybody and you don't do that in academics. If p-, if everybody can understand it, the, if you don't have the exclusive, uh, the exclusive key, then you, you move on. 

00:30:25
UTHSC Texas, 1985 

00:30:25
VIKTOR FRANKL If someone who is afraid, in simple words, in plain words, that when he leaves his house, say if case of agoraphobia, he might, uh, collapse, he might faint, he might, uh, get a stroke or a coronary, and if this man, who is plagued by this anticipatory fear, and that fear which causes the whole for-, circle formation, if he now does exactly the contrary, he'd been doing all the time, in, in so far as if, from now on, tries, for a moment only, the tongue in his cheek, to wish precisely what he'd been afraid all along. At the same time, as I put it before, the wind is taken out from the sails of his anxiety. And at the moment that anticipatory anxiety is dilated, it is not compatible with the wish. If I wish to faint, if I leave my house with a strong wish, now for a change, let's faint, for a change yesterday I had, uh, two strokes, today I would like to have three strokes, and so forth. At that moment, all these patients start laughing within themselves, in the same way as you right now did. And at that moment, the incompatibility with anxiety comes to the fore and a distance is put between the symptom, the pathology in themselves, and the sails of those person, the neurotic personalities. And now we understand how come that this capacity of self-detachment, this specifically human, uh, capacity come, is utilized in the form of paradoxical intention.

Haddon Klingberg Jr., Ph.D. psychologist, biographer/U.S.A. 

00:43:20
HADDON KLINGBERG Gustav Baumhackl was a neurologist in Vienna, as Viktor was, before Hitler. And, um, during the Nazi era, the Hitler era, Baumhackl, uh, had joined the Nazi party, as many, many citizens did. Uh, even without ill intent, it was, it was, in a way, the thing to do. And, um, during the war, uh, because Baumhackl was a Nazi party member, he was in full practice of Neurology. After the war, he was unemployed, because he had been a member of the Nazi party. And Viktor told me that I should meet Baumhackl and, and interview him, talk with him, which I did in Baumhackl's home. And, uh, he told me, which I knew, but he told me as though I did not know, that he had been a member of the Nazi party. And Baumhackl actually sobbed briefly, uh, when he told me that. And he said, so after the war, I was alone and unemployed and someone told me that Viktor Frankl, who had survived the concentration camps, was now Head of Neurology at the polyclinic and perhaps I could talk with him, uh, to see if there was some kind of work that I could do. And he said, Viktor Frankl gave me a little bit of friendship, when I had almost none. And, uh, gave me work to do in the polyclinic. And I will never, ever forget what he, what he did for me at that point in time. Baumhackl , for 50 years, every Christmas, brought flowers to Viktor and Elly at their flat without fail; decades of this. And he was telling me, 'I will never forget what he did for me'.

Jeffrey K. Zeig, Ph.D. director Milton H. Erickson Foundation/U.S.A. 

00:47:00
JEFFREY K. ZEIG We would, you know, talk about meaning and how to make meaning the pivotal choice in your life. So either it was meaningful or it wasn't meaningful. And if it wasn't meaningful, it wasn't worth considering and it wasn't worth doing. But that even if you were talking to an ex-Nazi, you could find a way of talking to that person to help them understand that what they had done before was not meaningful. And that, um, he had incredible faith in the ability of human beings to do things that were essentially meaningful. 

00:47:40
REUVEN BULKA It didn't sit well in many circles, but this is the way that he was because he was very much future-oriented. He didn't get fixated on the past and wanted to build towards the future. 

00:47:55
HADDON KLINGBERG And he said, 'Anyway, I didn't do anything that special for him. Uh, he didn't get paid, but I allowed him to see patients at the polyclinic'. And I said, 'Yes, but for him, um, this was, uh, an unbelievable gift that you gave him.' Um, and he said, 'Yes, but it was nothing spe-....' So Viktor and I are, kind of, arguing. I said, 'You can't take away from Baumhackl his gratitude to you for what you did for him.' He accepted that. And, and then said again, 'But why should I not have done this?' And, uh, I said, but then Baumhackl had said to me Frankl had just come out of the concentration camps. Viktor's defiant. 'So what? Why should I not have done this for him?' And, uh, he would not back down from the total logic that he saw in his acceptance of a person. And Viktor said, 'And in his heart, he was no Nazi. He joined the party, but in his heart, he was no Nazi and why should I not help him?' It was an extremely moving, uh, time and I came up against, uh, a, a side of Viktor that would not budge, absolutely would not budge. Uh, and it was, uh, his stand against collective guilt. Um, which got him in a lot of trouble, Viktor, and he took a lot of criticism for it, but, um, but guilt by association was not something, uh, that Viktor, uh, tolerated.

VIKTOR FRANKL You have to make an ascent and then you are doomed to making the descent. Nobody can remain on a peak. The mountaineer also cannot remain on the peak. He has to go down, sooner or later, to the valley. But what is important, is to know that there are peaks and during these peaks, we become aware of the infinite meaningfulness, or bliss of being.

And, of course, uh, you have to be well prepared to know the blessings, but he knew it by heart. It was always amazing for me was someone who was, as you know, uh, so well-known in the world and so busy and constantly working and writing, but he remembered, uh, whatever he had sung so many years ago back in his childhood.

JAY LEVINSON At the end of the war, they were death marching the concentration camp inmates and condensing them into various camps and then they would destroy the old camps, so there was no evidence of war crimes. And in the last camp he was in, I think it was Türkheim, I'm not sure, near Dachau, and, uh, they had marched them into the camp, but there were different inmates from various camps now. And, uh, one day, one morning he gets up and he looks over and someone had smuggled in a, uh, set of tefillin, the Jewish prayer boxes that orthodox Jews used when they do their morning and evening prayers during the week. And, uh, he saw this man get up and say the prayers and put on the tefillin and, uh, when he was done, Dr. Frankl asked the man if he could borrow his tefillin to put them on. He just had an urge to do this. And he said, 'I hadn't put on tefillin since my bar mitzvah when I learned how to do it, but I just felt like I wanted to do it'. And he asked the man, he had to kind of remind him how to put it on. And he put it on and he said he couldn't, he was so weak he couldn't remember any Jewish prayers. So the only thing he could remember was the kaddish, which is a prayer that affirms the importance of life at a time when people die. People commonly refer to it as the prayer for the dead, but it's really a very life-affirming prayer. And it's the only, all Jews know this prayer. And he, it's the only thing he could remember by heart, so he got up, put on tefillin that day, and said kaddish. Well, if you talk about divine intervention, that afternoon, the camp was liberated by American soldiers. And he told me that for the rest of his life he got up every morning, put on tefillin and said kaddish. 

01:02:50
HADDON KLINGBERG Viktor's concept or his experience of God was on such a grand scale, that the barriers between people and the barriers between religious groups were irrelevant to him. Um, he was sorry for them. Uh, never wanted to be, uh, partisan or denominational or sectarian. Um, and he moved among friends, uh, of all sorts of religious backgrounds and of no religious background. Um, there was, it was a level field for Viktor and other human beings. Um, not looking down on people because they were religious, not looking down on people because they were not religious. This, this acceptance, I think, was connected to a very deep, uh, personal faith he had. Um, in fact, as I recall it, near the end of his life, he was invited by the Rafsanjanis in Iran, where you have a, a Shia Muslim, uh, majority, to come there and give a lecture. But Viktor was not well enough to, to make the trip and so, this did not happen. But I could envision him going into a Muslim context and being the same person that he was for all of these, uh, other religious groups, uh, who found in logotherapy, uh, some compatibility with, with faith. Um, and, uh, something that, uh, Freud could not claim and, and, and, most psychologists, uh, in that era would have been negative about this, but Viktor drew to himself, uh, all kinds of people with religious backgrounds. 

01:04:50
SABC, South Africa 1985 

01:04:50
VIKTOR FRANKL But we don't leave the level of our scientifically-oriented theories. We don't step, uh, step into the field of theologians, we just remain open, or if you prefer, neutral. As a psychiatrist, I have to see to it, I have even to insist on it, that this theory and practice remain open; so that each psychiatrist, the agnostic, as well as the religiously-oriented, can use logotherapy for the benefit of his patients. And more than that, that each patient, the atheistically-oriented, as well as the believing patient can be, uh, uh, can benefit from logotherapy. That it be usable in the hands of each psychiatrist and applicable to each patient.

Harald Mori, MSc. Psychotherapist/Austria 

01:05:50
HARALD MORI Once he told me, uh, about, about his ge-, genius, let's say it, I think he was a genius, he, he told me, 'You know, uh, Mr. Mori, I, I don't think I am, am a great, uh, thinker. But I always try to think consequently to the end, somehow.' So he meant that, it's not important to think in a very complicated way, but to look forward to some, some, let's say, uh, endless future, uh, so to speak.

Ernest J. Nackord, Ph.D. pilot, psychologist/U.S.A. 

01:06:50
ERNEST J. NACKORD His teachings have invaded my heart, not just my intellect. So, I have found he changed everything. As a young man in school, and becoming a doctor and all, I always say don't ge-, oh, we were always told, 'Don't get emotionally involved with your, with your patients.' And I practiced that. It was very difficult. And then after I read 'Man's Search for Meaning', said hell with this, I'm gonna get involved with them. 

01:07:45
Michael Ascher, Ph.D. psychologist/U.S.A. 

01:07:45
MICHAEL ASCHER Logotherapy would have been, um, more, more successful academically, if more of his work was translated and that, that academics could see the depths of his understanding. 

01:08:00
JAY LEVINSON Because of the European tradition and his own humility, he did not market himself appropriately. When he did 'Man's Search for Ultimate Meaning', I negotiated the contract with the publisher. What do I know about negotiating a contract with a publisher? And I told him that. He says, 'Nah, nah, you do it.' Okay. And, in that way, even though people all over the world are using logotherapy concepts and techniques, uh, 50, 60, 70 years after he put them out there, he doesn't often get the credit. We now have the positive psychology movement, which is deeply rooted in logotherapy, you know. Uh, there's some behavior modification techniques that were introduced, for example, for sexual dysfunction, uh, you know, uh, fift-, forty years later by John Mundy at Johns Hopkins and he was talking about paradoxical intention, which Frankl talked about in the 20s, you know. And things like that, but I think that hurt him in some ways, um, in mainstream psychiatry, because he did not get the credit he deserved. Now all these people are doing it and he would be thrilled that they're doing it and he could care less about the credit. Um, but I would have liked to see him get more of the credit.

01:09:30
HADDON KLINGBERG Elly had worked in the background for, uh, all of these years and had never been recognized for her, for her work. The president of North Park was positive about this and so, we invited Viktor and Elly to come to Chicago, uh, each of them to receive an honorary doctorate. To my surprise, Viktor wrote to me that he could not accept a doctorate from North Park, because this was the first time Elly, uh, is recognized. And so, he would accompany her to Chicago and, uh, she could have the honorary doctorate. He did not want to diminish this honor for Elly. And so, it was the first time after 90, more than 90 trips to the United States, where he was lecturing and she would accompany him in the background; this was the first time he accompanied her to Chicago for her honor. And, uh, I think our friendship was somehow cemented, um, maybe because I recognized Elly and how important she was in, in his life and in his work. The audience rose to its feet for a long, long ovation. And during this elevation, now we, this ovation, we have to remember that Viktor is virtually blind here, very little vision left. Nevertheless, completely, uh, a surprise for all of us, he got up from his off-stage chair, walked straight toward Elly, across the stage and, when she saw him coming, she started to weep. And she told me later, 'I was determined not to cry.' But when she saw him coming, she broke down. And he walked right up to her, took her head in his hands and kissed her on both cheeks. Later he told me, 'I was kissing away her tears.' And I am sure that there was not a dry eye in that 2,000 people watching this, uh, when he came out and, uh, recognized her himself. As she was being recognized.

Betty Vlahos widow of Father George Vlahos, Ph.D./U.S.A. 

01:12:05
BETTY VLAHOS I remember, uh, Viktor saying to me one time, how much he loved Elly and, um, I remember a remark he made that stays with me, where he said, 'I never received a glass of water from her that had any moisture on it.' Which, to me, meant that she took loving care of him and, and made sure that she met his needs. And she was wonderful. The way she was able to, uh, work with him and type his letters and correspondence and I, I don't think many people knew that side of, uh, Elly Frankl. 

01:12:45
JAY LEVINSON Elly did all his typing and, he'd answer a letter and she'd be typing it as he answered it. And every article, every book he wrote, she hand typed on these old typewriters, you know, it wasn't like computers. And, and he used to work her all day and all night. And, of course, he worked all day and all night. 

01:13:00
Jeffrey K. Zeig, Ph.D. director Milton H. Erickson Foundation/U.S.A. 

01:13:00
JEFFREY K. ZEIG In my interactions with Elly, her focus seemed to be abnormal integrity. And an abnormal integrity in which, uh, she would just say her truth. And when you say that truth with anesthetic, if you're going to do surgery, you're going to speak the truth in an abnormally direct way, then you have plenty of anesthetic. And she always impressed very much, as having that kind of anesthetic, but being willing to dare to tell her truth, no matter what it was.

HADDON KLINGBERG Viktor's family, those who, who survived the Holocaust, are buried in Central Cemetery in Vienna, again, and in a Jewish section of the cemetery; which by the way, is very poorly kept, and, the, the bombings, the damage from the war, remains there. Uh, Elly's family buried in the Catholic cemetery on the other side of the Danube. And I learned, in the conversations, that when Viktor and Elly died, they would not be buried together. That Viktor would be buried in the plot with his family. And, by the way, the marker there names the members of his family who were lost in the Holocaust, who were killed in the Holocaust, in memory of them. Uh, and Viktor was to be buried there with the parts of his family, uh, who had already been buried there. And Elly would, would be buried in the Catholic cemetery. And I said to them, 'So you born separated by the Danube, separated by religion, separated by class, separated by education, Elly was a home economics major in high school, Viktor, M.D., Ph.D., honorary doctorates; so much separating the two of them. And then I said, 'At the end, you're separated again.' And Viktor says, 'I don't give a damn, where we are buried. No one can take away from Elly and me, the life that we have spent together and all that we have done together. This we keep. And I couldn't give a damn about where I'm buried or, we can't be separated.' Again, that defiant, that defiant attitude and Elly is agreeing. Sitting there nodding, 'Yeah, this is right. Where we're buried doesn't matter. What matters, is the life that we've lived together.'
