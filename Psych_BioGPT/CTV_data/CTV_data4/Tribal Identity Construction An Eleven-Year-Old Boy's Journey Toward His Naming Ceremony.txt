ROCKEY ROBBINS George is very kind. I appreciate that. Well I tell ya, this is my first attempt at doing something with, um, technology like this. I always just go places, and I just talk, it's what I've always done, but if there's ever been something to present on that I've done which should have something like that, it's this. 

00:03:25
Tribal Identity Construction: An Eleven Year Old Boy's Journey toward his Naming Ceremony 

00:03:25
ROCKEY ROBBINS Um Tribal Identity Construction: An Eleven Year Old Boy's Journey Toward His Naming Ceremony, a Choctaw boy. I'm just jumping right in because we don't have, we, we only have about 30 minutes to talk about this before we do the little finale that we have here, so if you don't mind I'm jumping right in without much to-do. Okay. Um, let me read you a quote first, about, ah, a person writing about Choctaws. He says, his name is Morris, written in 1860. 

00:04:00
"Names with the Indians are not usually arbitrary and meaningless, as with us; they are intended to be characteristic, being suggested by some incident, some family trait, or some fancied peculiarity of a child. The name, if intended to be characteristic of the family,..., but if of the child only it is limited to the single person to whom it is given." 

00:04:00
ROCKEY ROBBINS "Names with the Indians are not usually arbitrary and meaningless, as with us; they are intended to be characteristic, being suggested by some incident, some family trait, or some fa.. fancied peculiarity of a child. The name, if intended to be characteristic of the family, um, but the name, um, but if of the child only it is limited to the single person to whom it is given." But of the family it often refers to the whole family. 

00:04:35
One person... was called Achuk-mabbee, which is a compound word, ... rendered "good hunter," ... no doubt, derived from some successful feats in slaughtering the buffalo, the bear, the deer, or valor and prowess in war. Benson, H.C., & Morris, T.A. (1860). Life among the Choctaw Indians: And sketches of the South-west. Cincinnati: L. Swormstedt & A. Poe. Chapter VII. 

00:04:35
ROCKEY ROBBINS Ah, one person, um, was, was called good hunter for instance, no doubt derived from some successful feats in slaughtering the buffalo, the bear, the deer, or valor and prowess in war. Continuing on, "It is done thus. When the time arrives for the ceremony, one of the warriors rises from his seat, and calls the name in a shrill, long tone of voice, 'On-say-ooh-ma(ph).' At the call of the young man, at the call the young man rises, picks up the war club, and goes forth to him from, when, when he informs the new man that he is now, what he is now named, and that he is as other men, and he now can assume the manners and customs of other men. He then puts a feather on his head, and when that is done, the newly dubbed man raises his war club above his head, starts a long war whoop, and runs round in a circle to the place from which he started, and when he stops, he cries, 'Whoo! Whoo!' From that time on, he's a man with a name. Before that, he's known as No Name." In the ceremonies. 

00:06:05
Cultural Genocide might be defined as the removal of a people's identity. From the beginning of contact between Native Americans and the conquistadors, the appropriation of European names has been fundamental to Western expansion. Introduction 

00:06:05
ROCKEY ROBBINS "Cultural genocide might be defined as the removal of a people's identity." In particular, taking their names away from them. In particular, taking the names of places around them, taking the Indian name away and replacing them with English names in most instances in the United States. "From the beginning of contact between, ah between Native Americans and conquistadors, the appropriation of European names has been fundamental to this European, Western expansion." For instance, Columbus, the first missionary, hum the first missionary to the heathen, ah the first merchant, the first entrepreneur, supposedly, the first American, Columbus became the name that heralded a new age. A new land, given to a new identity, and by 1792, America's great college, King's College was renamed after him Columbia University. And the district, where the capital lay, the district was called Columbia. It didn't matter that Columbus was a male violent, gold-hungry explorer who murdered and enslaved Indian people. He was considered America's first real hero, and he personified the whole notion of hero American Manifest Destiny. But today what's wonderful is because of people like Marie and Jill, today Columbia is hosting Indigenous Voices. Not as good as changing the name of Columbia back to an Indian name, not quite that good, but one, but it's a step in the right direction of reparation, and you know, the way we kinda see it, Columbus is probably a lot better off now than he was then, and you know, maybe he's kinda happy. Now since he, his eyes have been cleared of some things that this kind of thing is happening. So power be to Columbus too, you know, he might be, he's happy for this day too. Indigenous, uh. Indigenous Voices. 

00:08:35
Native names of persons and places were bestowed with profound meaning. Retaining control over the meanings was tantamount to maintaining a unique perception of reality. 

00:08:35
ROCKEY ROBBINS Native names of persons and places typically had to do, had profound meaning, though. They, and they had to do with retaining control and meaning, and it was tantamount to maintain a, a certain kind of perception of reality to keep the names of, of these places. Um, and yet, that's not what happened. Um, despite revitalization programs in.. among many tribes, children and adolescents who know their tribal songs, their dances, the protocols, and who understand their traditional spiritual teachings, are still a, are a minority. And that's very sad. I went to a Shawnee stomp dance recently, and ah, I was sitting under one of the arbors, and a person said, "You know, we're really afraid, because our young people can't lead these, these stomps anymore, because not many of them know the songs anymore." And they were very sad about that. I think there's a lot of problems that go with not being able to, not being able to connect with our traditions. I think there's some research out there that suggests that Indian people who really do experience a lot of feelings of alienation, not knowing how to speak their language, not knowing a lot of their cultural stuff. And people like Garrett and Carol, they've listed isolation as one of those prominent problems among Indian youth today. I, it's not just Indian youth, it's Indian people, who go to work every day at Indian places where they work, at Indian health clinics, and they can't speak the language. And they hear other people speaking it, and they have that little feeling inside of them, "My gosh, I can't even understand the people speaking my own language, and I can't, can't..." They.. they experience a lot of alienation for it. Um, and it is feelings of, of self-esteem, self-esteem is affected also, because there's a realization that what is valued in your tribe, really isn't valued by dominant culture. And all you have to do is look at the names of different places around you. And so all of this leads to misuse of drugs, and alcohol, and violence to themselves and to others and, and prison. 

00:11:00
Choctaw names "were nearly always connotative referring generally to some animal, and often predicating some attributes of that animal. They were generally named, or rather acquired a name and sometimes several in succession, from some note exploit or hazardous adventure" (Cushman, 1899/1990), p 47. 

00:11:00
ROCKEY ROBBINS Okay, specifically Choctaw names, specifically Choctaw names, what was, were they all about. Well it's, Cushman, one of the writers in the late 19th century said, "Choctaw names were nearly always connotative of referring generally to some animal, predicating some attributes of that animal. And they were generally named or acquired a name and sometimes several in succession, from some noted exploit or hazardous adventure." They were very important. Okay, what is this project that I'm talking about? I, I really, this has bothered me for years. Everywhere I go, where I speak, and I've spoken, half the reservations here in the United States and all over Oklahoma, and I can't tell ya how many people come up to me and tell me, "I don't have an Indian name. And it really bothers me that I don't have an Indian name." And that's always been something that's ah stuck with me, and, um, I'm gonna share something that's very personal today, a little different than most presentations. My son, On-say-ho-ma(ph), over here, Red Eagle, and I began to talk about my son's half-sister, who I was lucky enough to have in my own home for about five years when she was really small. And ah he, he wanted, you know, he wanted to know more about his Choctaw culture. And so my son began to work with him on, on different kind of things, and so um, we finally decided we wanted to give him an Indian name. And that's what I'm going to be talking to you about specifically today, something very personal to us, some things that we're planning in conjunction with a lot of other things. 

00:12:55
The Choctaw Naming Project is a community-based program involving collaboration with Choctaw elders in both its development and implementation Choctaw Naming Project 

00:12:55
ROCKEY ROBBINS Um, first of all, the Choctaw Naming Project is a community-based program involving collaboration with Choctaw elders, in both its development and its implementation. It's community-based, at the forefront, the healing has to do not just with an individual, but an entire tribal community. And not just the tribal community, everyone, in a certain sense. 

00:13:25
By placing tribal meaning at the forefront of the project, the participants respond, not only to the individual identity issues but to the collective trauma Choctaws have suffered. In this larger tribal context tribal/cultural memory is restored and healing is brought to the person and the community. Choctaw Naming Project 

00:13:25
ROCKEY ROBBINS Um, so placing tribal naming at the forefront of this project is kinda different in some ways. The participants respond not only to individual identity issues, but to a collective trauma that Choctaws have suffered. And in this larger tribal context, this tribal/cultural memory is restored. And healing is brought to the person and the community. 

00:14:00
The intent of this program is to foster the participant's understanding of themselves as well as to nourish the vitality of traditional meanings and tribal/social practices among Choctaw people. Choctaw Naming Project 

00:14:00
This program is for both identity development and social change, which are never separate. In fact this project is an attempt to resist the imposition of individualist ways of approaching life with the Choctaw tribal-socio-individual perspective. Choctaw Naming Project 

00:14:00
ROCKEY ROBBINS And so, that's the intent of what's going on. Now if you know much about the Choctaw tribe, so many of the Choctaw people have lost much of their traditions in Oklahoma. There's a lot of things that have been lost in Mississippi as well, um but there's just lots of things that, like there's this past year Jesse, my son, On-say-ho-ma(ph), Jesse Robbins, he was able to participate in the first traditional stomp dance that had been done in years and years and years, where a buffalo was killed, ah by hand, and then it was fed at this, ah at the end of the stomp dance to all the people. 

00:14:45
Its purpose is to investigate the possible value of a Choctaw naming ceremony as a way of promoting tribal identity for an eleven year old Choctaw boy and in promoting family connectedness between this boy, his mother and uncle, as well as tribal connections. Purpose 

00:14:45
ROCKEY ROBBINS And it was an incredible day for Choctaw people, that this had happened. But sadly, many Choctaw people have, have been assimilated in many of their ways. Of course not ever totally, there's no way you can take that rhythm and spirit from Choctaw people completely ever, but losing a lot of the knowledges, and losing a lot of the ways has been a major part, problem. So the purpose, the intent of this program is to foster the participants', um the participants' understanding of themselves, as well as to nourish the vitality of traditional meanings and tribal social practices among Choctaw people. 

00:15:25
We learn and create who we are. We have a relationship with our own lives as well as with others. Construction of Self 

00:15:25
ROCKEY ROBBINS  This is something that we, that is just incredibly important to it. Ah, you see this thing about ah construction of the self, for one. 

00:15:40
Integrating the wholeness of ourselves in our various social, psychological and biological aspects including roles as family, community and tribal members The participant in this study was enable to join a collective endeavor in addressing, in some individual way, a social issue. Construction of Self 

00:15:40
ROCKEY ROBBINS Um, I kinda mentioned this already, Indian people tend, historically, traditionally have tended to define themselves not as dicardian individuals, but in terms of the relationships with other people. And that's the way their worth is seen. Well, so this community-based program has to do with collaboration, ah between elders and family, and the child, in order to build this, this ah kind of an identity. 

00:16:10
The community provides support and instruction related to helping to integrate all the aspects of identity into a comprehensive whole. 

00:16:10
ROCKEY ROBBINS  Okay, um, so this, that's very important thing. The construction of the self. Okay, I'm gonna get to that. I'm gonna say one word before I get into that, about the organization. Many times Indian people are criticized for not being good at organization, and the way I'm doing these right now, I'm sure that's been confirmed. Because I can't even see what I'm getting, here. I can barely see it. Um, but, um, that's, it's kind of a misnomer in some ways. If any of you have ever been a part of trying to put together a pow-wow, or any kind of Indian ceremony or ritual, or even a sweat, one Saturday, you know how much organization is required to do that kind of thing. And so ah, ah this is no less complicated. I'ma just tell you what, what is, what's going on in the organization. Came up with several things that are important. One of them is preparation. There's a preparation period, number one. It includes considering things like goals, tasks, estimated, estimated time, schedules, budget, responsibilities. It includes the family of this young man, the young man himself, and the elders in these meetings. And it's preparation, determining the goals, tasks, etcetera, number one. Number two, it has to do with the second component, which is collaboration. They, when they get together, they, we emphasize the tribal community, and we receive guidance, advice, and supervision and support from elders. Number three, that's really important, and unless the person starts with these kind of ideas, you're not gonna get there. I, I mean it's just too complicated, you gotta keep these things in mind. Number three is ah the key to the service component is that persons working on the project work with each other, and not for each other. Because, um there's, the idea is that the process of interrelating with each other as you work is really what the goal is. I mean, ah, you can have all these goals as a program and you think you're gonna accomplish, but if you accomplish them and you hate each other and you're being mean to each other all the time, ah you've missed out on life, and living life in a healthy way. And so a very important component is, is to make sure from the very beginning that this relational component is emphasized, that you're not, to discourage condescending bossiness from each, from bossiness and things like that. Number four is integrating the details of the project with the tribe, and having, making sure not just that you get consent from them, but you get approval from, from them, and support from them. Number five is reflection. Reflection is the fifth component. It involves both subjective and a discursive element. Now this is a component that's I think unique for most community projects, in a certain sense, because in Western ways, the subjective is often emphasized, the individual is what's emphasized. Well, according to Indian, most traditional Indian people, truth drops out of interactions. Not from deep, deep considerations of who you are, apart from everything that exists, and that you find you get to the bottom of things in your heart. Well, you know, while not saying that that's totally bad, Indian people have often thought of truth as dropping out from interactions with each other. Meaning is discursive, rather than just individualistic. Okay number, number six, the last, this component is celebration, and you, you have to plan that too. It's a time for appreciation for the efforts of the individual quester, as well as for all the helpers, and empathy and care is shown for it. And then the last one is, um, the component entails the involvement in promoting future cultural and tribal activities. That it doesn't just stop with that. Okay. Let me get now to um the, some of the things that emerged. When we met, here's some of the things that happened, the elements that emerged out of it. As we began to talk, um um, we begin to wonder, what is it, you know, in the past, these people, males, for the most part, that's what you read about, and which is something that we wanna change, because we wanna do one for females as well, but we're focusing on this young man, here this so I'm gonna focus on that today. What is it that he needs to accomplish in order to get a name? In the past there were war acts, there were things that, killing certain animals, there were things like that, um, and those things were really important, but today, in this time, what would be valuable to people as they move toward, in this journey? So we meet with these elders, we e-mail back and forth, and certain things emerge. So the enactments are collectively negotiated, and they emerge out of that collective negotiation. And here's what these wonderful people came up with. I'm gonna, I'm gonna tell you some of them. Here, they came up with, with several of them. Seventeen, I'll just be brief on some. Then, just think of what this kid's expected to do. Remember, he's Choctaw, and, ah, his uncle is Choctaw so he, one of them, the first one, some of you are going why, why is he doing that, for those of you that are in the know about Indian things, but I'll explain. 

00:22:05
Go to Sun Dance Ceremony with Aunt and Uncle as Supporters to support dancers Write out an entire page of Choctaw words with English translations Produce a song on CD about being a Choctaw boy living in both the Choctaw and non-Choctaw world. Participate in the creation of a sweat lodge and later participation in the sweat associated with the naming ceremony. Write a list of things he likes to do that non-tribal people like to do Emergent Project Enactments 

00:22:05
ROCKEY ROBBINS First thing, he had to go to a Sun Dance ceremony with his aunt and uncle, as supporters to support dancers. Some of you, what is a Choctaw being asked to do that, well that's what they want him to do. Now there's a connection. We have, Choctaws have sun dances, we do have sun dances, in southeastern Oklahoma, um, but they're based on Lakota stuff. I mean, because they was brought there. And these people are some of the great, best, most powerful medicine men you'll ever see, in southeastern Oklahoma who do these, these. Because the sun has always been a, is, is just central to Choctaw people, the sun. And so they wanted him to go to the Sun Dance ceremony. My son Jesse, who's his uncle, is a Sun Dancer. And so first thing to do, he had to do that. And if you've been to Sun Dances, you know how hard they are. They're very difficult, and that kid worked his butt off at that Sun Dance, working every single day. Okay, um, secondly, he had to write two stories or memories from the Sun Dance. And he got approval from the Sun Dance leader to do not only that, but to draw some pictures of things that he saw at the Sun Dance. Other things that these, these elders wanted him to do, they wanted him to go to the Choctaw festival with his mother and write a story about a memorable event. 

00:23:30
Go to Sun Dance Ceremony with Aunt and Uncle as Supporters to support dancers Write out an entire page of Choctaw words with English translations Produce a song on CD about being a Choctaw boy living in both the Choctaw and non-Choctaw world. Participate in the creation of a sweat lodge and later participation in the sweat associated with the naming ceremony. Write a list of things he likes to do that non-tribal people like to do Emergent Project Enactments 

00:23:30
ROCKEY ROBBINS Another one, write an entire page of Choctaw words on the left side, and put the definitions of them in English on the right side. Learn a hundred words by the end of the year, for this little eleven-year-old boy. 

00:23:40
Listen to mother tell two traditional Choctaw stories and relay those stories to uncle Learn a Choctaw song from uncle to be sung with his uncle at Naming Ceremony Make a scrap book filled with assignments as well as other cultural and tribal enactments Make a list of new possibilities and new responsibilities he will have after the Naming Ceremony Emergent Project Enactments 

00:23:40
ROCKEY ROBBINS  Another one, make a scrap book filled with the, these assignments, and other cultural activities and enactments you involve yourself in. Um, another one. The mother has to teach him two traditional Choctaw songs, Choctaw stories, and he's supposed to go to his uncle and tell those stories to his uncle, and relay them to them. Okay, another one, he has to learn one Choctaw song that he'll later sing at the Naming Ceremony. Okay, uh, he, now his mother, this, this is the kind of thing you deal with. His mother, who's part Euro-American, became concerned during the discussions about whether, he said, she became kind of scared. She said, I know how people treat Indian people, in our public schools in Oklahoma. I know how they're ostracized. We all know. We know how, especially the schools that say they treat them the nicest. That's because they're covered up, and can't even see how they're mistreating, not acknowledging the unique knowledges and stories and things. And so she said, so I don't want him to just do Indian stuff. And so here's what she wanted. She said, I want him also, along with these Indian things, to write a list of things he likes and doesn't like to do with non-Indian people, because it's not the only world he lives in. He lives in more than one world, he moves in and out of the world. He said, she said, I also want him to write a story about something he did with a non-tribal person, and so he doesn't end up judgmental toward white, Euro-American people, and African-American people. She wanted that in there too. But she also added this, she said I also want him to write a list of Indian people he trusts, to talk to, whenever he feels his Choctaw ways are not respected. 

00:25:45
Go to Sun Dance Ceremony with Aunt and Uncle as Supporters to support dancers Write out an entire page of Choctaw words with English translations Produce a song on CD about being a Choctaw boy living in both the Choctaw and non-Choctaw world. Participate in the creation of a sweat lodge and later participation in the sweat associated with the naming ceremony. Write a list of things he likes to do that non-tribal people like to do Emergent Project Enactments 

00:25:45
ROCKEY ROBBINS A few other things, I'm gonna skip a few of them. He's, he was told that he has, he was to make a CD about being a Choctaw boy living in both Choctaw and non-Choctaw worlds. And you're gonna hear it. Okay, I'm gonna talk just a little bit more. I'll have to be really quick here. Um, okay. 

00:26:05
Storytelling: The telling of stories has central place in human cultures throughout the world, especially among American Indian peoples (Robbins, 2006). Core elements of project 

00:26:05
Attachment psychologist Daniel Siegal (2003) writes of narrative interaction as the basis for healthy bonding but it also helps the child to form neurological patterns in their brains which will help them make sense of their experiences which facilitates emotional regulation functioning. Storytelling 

00:26:05
Family stories become a part of the permanent explicit autobiographical memory system. Joint attention to autobiographical reflections involve the construction of narrative around the memory talk between individuals. Shareable story enactments may influence our internal lives, influencing self-organization and emotional modulation. Storytelling 

00:26:05
ROCKEY ROBBINS  Um, some of the things that we'll be using are we'll use storying, all the research on the episodic memory is unbelievable right now, supporting how important stories are in families, and how different kids are, that hear stories when they're little, how they have better relationships with other people, ah they've talked about what happens when stories are told between mother and father and child, and the connections that are made, predictor of better relationships later, Indian people have always said that. We're also using inter-textual documentation, you saw the word documentation at the beginning. 

00:26:45
Documentation: Documents have been used to take land to cheat Native Americans since the beginning of colonialization. The author's experience is appropriated and transferred into the domain of expert knowledge when it is interpreted and is often unrecognizable to the original experiencer. Core Elements of Project 

00:26:45
Psychology is by no means the only discipline that employs the file for the re-description of person and for the presentation of worth of the author. Foucault (1979) argues that it has with its dominant culture "normalizing gaze" has enabled the subjugation of minority persons. But Foucault argued that documentation is not a technique that necessarily marginalizes minorities. 

00:26:45
ROCKEY ROBBINS  I chose to, we chose, as a group, this emerged out of the group with the elders, is they wanted to use inter-textual documentation. Now, we think of documentation as Indian people, and we think that's the way they got our land, that's the way they keep stealing things from us all the time. But you know what, you can use the tools of your oppressor. And people like Michel Foucault outlines ways that oppressed people can use documentation, and to avoid the expert knowledges of those in power over them, and that you can use those, those kind of things to actually ah help ingrain certain experiences that we have in our minds, and in our hearts, so that when we meet up with stressful kind of events, a certain story will be in our head, and we'll go through it to resolution, because we've heard the stories. 

00:27:40
The core team in this project recommended a variety of means of documenting to simultaneously tap into culture, contemporary expression and technology. They suggested the use a variety of media, such as making a CD, a scrap book, as well as poetry, letters, drawings and more conventional forms of documentation. Document inter-textuality 

00:27:40
ROCKEY ROBBINS  Now they wanted to use inter-textual stuff, so they wanted to use computers. Unlike me, not able to use them at all, and somehow a fear of them, that I cannot really deal with it, um, we're gonna do that. 

00:27:55
Purification ceremony Ceremonial meal: After the sweat, a traditional Choctaw meal will be shared by persons who participated in the sweat as others who have came to support the Unnamed Choctaw. The Unnamed Choctaw speaks a sentence in Choctaw, sings a traditional song, tells a traditional story, speaks about his experience if he wishes, and lastly the song he has produced with his uncle is played. Naming Ritual 

00:27:55
Toward the end of the meal, elders will call the Unnamed Choctaw to the front. A Choctaw song will be sung with everyone standing. His uncle will address the witnesses telling them of the Unnamed Choctaw's accomplishments. Naming Ritual

ROCKEY ROBBINS We're also gonna use a purification ceremony, a sweat ceremony, we have a sweat lodge, ourselves. I've been in over 400 sweats in my life, we've tried to count them up, Jesse also is a Sun Dancer who's went through all the requirements that we see as important, and Choctaws and many other tribes have always sweat, used sweats, anyway. Um, and ah, actually we, we have a meal after the sweat, and then the Naming Ceremony comes along for this young man, and, and gifts are given to the mother and the uncle and the elders, um, of, that have participated in this, and then the uncle goes up there, the elders speak, the uncle goes up there and he calls the young no name Choctaw up to the front, and he says come, come forth, and he elongates that name. 

00:28:50
He will next give him an Eagle Feather, shout out his new name in an elongated way, grab one of his arms, and race around the area. Core participants will form a line with the newly named person at the end. Witnesses will line up to shake their hands. Documents will be available to look at. Naming Ritual 

00:28:50
ROCKEY ROBBINS Very, elongates it, and he puts a feather in that boy's head, on his head, and then he grabs him by the arm and he runs him around the building, and he has the name. And then we have documents, we have scrapbooks, we have all these other things laid out in the room where it takes place, and then we engage in dialogue with elders and all the people who've came to participate in the ceremony, and they give him the kind of support that he deserves, and tell, and speculate on how this can affect the tribe as a whole, and ah, and so that's the kind of things that'll happen there at the end. Okay, I could go into the research, the way we did the research, but I don't have time. And so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna ask Jesse to play this song, and you'll see pictures of him, this is the song that my son and he did, um, as a part of the enactments that the elders, and Jesse my son, and his mother wanted him to do. And he's already completed this assignment. I think just watching it, it's at the very end Jesse, 48 I think, um, but ah, just watching it you can see the, just, how, the joy.

The No Name Choctaw participant: 11 years old, quiet, Small school, 5% Euro-, 15% Native American Separation anxiety/general anxiety/fears about father's house Interested in learning about Choctaw heritage Primary Participants 

00:30:10
ROCKEY ROBBINS  When he came, first came, as Jesse gets this up here, the complaints he had, his mother said, is he was suffering from separation anxiety, that seemed to have been pretty much cured after the Sun Dance. 

00:30:25
Mother is a 33 year old Choctaw Uncle is 24 year old Choctaw Two Choctaw elders in their early seventies Primary Participants 

00:30:25
ROCKEY ROBBINS And he was also suffering from um, um, he and his family, not the mother, but his family, there's some problems, drugs and alcohol, and he, fear about those kind of things. He also experienced a general anxiety, a kinda general anxiety that he experienced. And we're confident that we have healing ways, that can work on those kind of things. Especially if he's wrapped in a circle of love and care, from all the rest of us, and this is one example of it. I wish I could have given you more of them, there's also letters that different people at the Sun Dance have written him, and Choctaw elders have written him, just to surround him with this kind of stuff, Indian way of healing, supported by psychological stuff, but here's the song that he and Jesse put together.

"Names with the Indians are not usually arbitrary and meaningless, as with us; they are intended to be characteristic, being suggested by some incident, some family trait, or some fancied peculiarity of a child. The name, if intended to be characteristic of the family,..., but if of the child only it is limited to the single person to whom it is given." 

00:36:55
One person... was called Achuk-mabbee, which is a compound word, ... rendered "good hunter," ... no doubt, derived from some successful feats in slaughtering the buffalo, the bear, the deer, or valor and prowess in war. Benson, H.C., & Morris, T.A. (1860). Life among the Choctaw Indians: And sketches of the South-west. Cincinnati: L. Swormstedt & A. Poe. Chapter VII. 

00:36:55
Cultural Genocide might be defined as the removal of a people's identity. From the beginning of contact between Native Americans and the conquistadors, the appropriation of European names has been fundamental to Western expansion. Introduction 

00:36:55
Native names of persons and places were bestowed with profound meaning. Retaining control over the meanings was tantamount to maintaining a unique perception of reality. 

00:36:55
Choctaw names "were nearly always connotative referring generally to some animal, and often predicating some attributes of that animal. They were generally named, or rather acquired a name and sometimes several in succession, from some note exploit or hazardous adventure" (Cushman, 1899/1990), p 47. 

00:36:55
Native American youth, often living in a larger society whose values and customs are at odds with those of their own communities, find themselves in a struggle to hold on to an identity where their worth is not acknowledged. Mitchell and O'Neil (1988) and later, Radin (2006) 

00:36:55
The Choctaw Naming Project is a community-based program involving collaboration with Choctaw elders in both its development and implementation Choctaw Naming Project 

00:36:55
By placing tribal meaning at the forefront of the project, the participants respond, not only to the individual identity issues but to the collective trauma Choctaws have suffered. In this larger tribal context tribal/cultural memory is restored and healing is brought to the person and the community. Choctaw Naming Project 

00:36:55
The intent of this program is to foster the participant's understanding of themselves as well as to nourish the vitality of traditional meanings and tribal/social practices among Choctaw people. Choctaw Naming Project 

00:36:55
This program is for both identity development and social change, which are never separate. In fact this project is an attempt to resist the imposition of individualist ways of approaching life with the Choctaw tribal-socio-individual perspective. Choctaw Naming Project 

00:36:55
Its purpose is to investigate the possible value of a Choctaw naming ceremony as a way of promoting tribal identity for an eleven year old Choctaw boy and in promoting family connectedness between this boy, his mother and uncle, as well as tribal connections. Purpose 

00:36:55
We learn and create who we are. We have a relationship with our own lives as well as with others. Construction of Self 

00:36:55
Integrating the wholeness of ourselves in our various social, psychological and biological aspects including roles as family, community and tribal members The participant in this study was enable to join a collective endeavor in addressing, in some individual way, a social issue. Construction of Self 

00:36:55
The community provides support and instruction related to helping to integrate all the aspects of identity into a comprehensive whole. 

00:36:55
Storytelling: The telling of stories has central place in human cultures throughout the world, especially among American Indian peoples (Robbins, 2006). Core elements of project 

00:36:55
Attachment psychologist Daniel Siegal (2003) writes of narrative interaction as the basis for healthy bonding but it also helps the child to form neurological patterns in their brains which will help them make sense of their experiences which facilitates emotional regulation functioning. Storytelling 

00:36:55
Family stories become a part of the permanent explicit autobiographical memory system. Joint attention to autobiographical reflections involve the construction of narrative around the memory talk between individuals. Shareable story enactments may influence our internal lives, influencing self-organization and emotional modulation. Storytelling 

00:36:55
Documentation: Documents have been used to take land to cheat Native Americans since the beginning of colonialization. The author's experience is appropriated and transferred into the domain of expert knowledge when it is interpreted and is often unrecognizable to the original experiencer. Core Elements of Project 

00:36:55
Psychology is by no means the only discipline that employs the file for the re-description of person and for the presentation of worth of the author. Foucault (1979) argues that it has with its dominant culture "normalizing gaze" has enabled the subjugation of minority persons. But Foucault argued that documentation is not a technique that necessarily marginalizes minorities. 

00:36:55
There is also the possibility for the subject and his circle of care to play a central role in contributing to the specification or documentation of his own self. Documentation 

00:36:55
In so doing he becomes conscious of his participation in the constitution of his own life. He begins to see that he can assume responsibility for inventing himself and result in a realization of personal power. Documentation 

00:36:55
Instead of simply using maps to help represent progress, or written documents such as poems, lists and letters, whose visual simplicity limits our awareness of the actual territories it is supposed to reveal, White and Epston encourage expanding the possibilities of awareness in children. Document inter-textuality 

00:36:55
White and Epston caution against limiting children's awareness to the visual sphere, alone. Multiple forms of documentation can be interwoven beyond the frozen frame of the visual finished product, thickening emotional and cognitive expression. Document inter-textuality 

00:36:55
The core team in this project recommended a variety of means of documenting to simultaneously tap into culture, contemporary expression and technology. They suggested the use a variety of media, such as making a CD, a scrap book, as well as poetry, letters, drawings and more conventional forms of documentation. Document inter-textuality 

00:36:55
Listen to mother tell two traditional Choctaw stories and relay those stories to uncle Learn a Choctaw song from uncle to be sung with his uncle at Naming Ceremony Make a scrap book filled with assignments as well as other cultural and tribal enactments Make a list of new possibilities and new responsibilities he will have after the Naming Ceremony Emergent Project Enactments 

00:36:55
Go to Sun Dance Ceremony with Aunt and Uncle as Supporters to support dancers Write out an entire page of Choctaw words with English translations Produce a song on CD about being a Choctaw boy living in both the Choctaw and non-Choctaw world. Participate in the creation of a sweat lodge and later participation in the sweat associated with the naming ceremony. Write a list of things he likes to do that non-tribal people like to do Emergent Project Enactments 

00:36:55
Purification ceremony Ceremonial meal: After the sweat, a traditional Choctaw meal will be shared by persons who participated in the sweat as others who have came to support the Unnamed Choctaw. The Unnamed Choctaw speaks a sentence in Choctaw, sings a traditional song, tells a traditional story, speaks about his experience if he wishes, and lastly the song he has produced with his uncle is played. Naming Ritual 

00:36:55
Family members and other significant others act as audiences of the participant's comments and then later speak about what they heard the participant tell. Specifically, the outsider witnesses: Naming Ritual 

00:36:55
1). Comment on expressions that "struck a chord" 2). Comment on images that suggest the participant's purposes, values, beliefs, hopes and commitments 3). Comment on how the participants actions resonated in their own lives 4). Comment on how their own lives or thinking has changed having witnessed the event Naming Ritual 

00:36:55
This last type of response is especially vital because it not only validates the participants experience but translates the outside witness into an active participant. Naming Ritual 

00:36:55
Toward the end of the meal, elders will call the Unnamed Choctaw to the front. A Choctaw song will be sung with everyone standing. His uncle will address the witnesses telling them of the Unnamed Choctaw's accomplishments. Naming Ritual 

00:36:55
He will next give him an Eagle Feather, shout out his new name in an elongated way, grab one of his arms, and race around the area. Core participants will form a line with the newly named person at the end. Witnesses will line up to shake their hands. Documents will be available to look at. Naming Ritual
