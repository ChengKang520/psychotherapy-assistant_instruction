HARVILLE HENDRIX So if I could have your attention. Um, if I could have your attention. Uh. I’m Harville Hendrix. And um, thank you. This is um, Anne. And Bill. And they are our demonstration couple for this morning and I want to thank you for coming all the way here. And also up here, in front of all these strangers. So. I have always been very grateful for couples who will do a public demonstration, given that I wouldn’t do one for, no way in hell. So. Um, um, I’m too, I’m too shy uh to do that. So long as I’m in charge, I’m not shy but if I’m not. Um and I want to also introduce you to, um, Bruce Krapishatz who’s going to quickly walk up here and wave so you can see him. Bruce is in Pasadena, he is a master trainer in Imago Relationship Therapy. Uh, he is a former salmon fisherman. Uh, and has a great worldly life along with his therapy life and he is also responsible for inviting Anne and Bill to be here this morning. The reason Bruce is on the stage is that his narcissism is so high, that um, I wanted him to have you alls look at him and praise him for a moment with some applause. Um. And he also is going to be down front at the end of this session with some papers to tell you about Imago Therapy Training options that he does and on the paper I assume there’s the website for people who are not in this region. Imago is now being practiced in 30 countries and I don’t know how many countries the training occurs, but about 30 faculty all over the world. So Bruce is local and he’ll also tell you about the global. Thanks very much, Bruce. So he’ll be down here at the end to visit with and I can be here for a while, too, before my next assignment. I want to start with a comment or two about this clinical demonstration and also put it in theoretical context. The theoretical context is that we operate, we in Imago, out of an assumption, it’s a theory-based therapy. And the assumption is that connection is, describes the universe, and therefore us. And that connection is what everybody yearns for, and which they have originally until it’s ruptured in childhood and gets re-ruptured in adult intimate partnerships. And that therapy is basically, um, helping couples or individuals, but we primarily are a couples therapy, although people do practice Imago psychotherapy. Um, that our purpose is to help a couple restore the awareness that they are connected. That the connection has never been broken because you can’t, you can’t get out of the universe but you can lose awareness that you’re connected to universe. And that when couples restore connection between themselves, that they repair actually imbalances in the brain, the hemispheres are balances and the lobes are integrated. They repair also emotional splits in the self and they return to a sense of connection to the universe. So that’s the first thing. The second thing is that we have over the past 30 years, of experimenting with what works, decided that what works best for couples is, um, more about changing the structure of their conversation. That if we can change the structure of their conversation and the content of their conversation, that couples restore connection. So that means that what we do basically is help couples learn how to talk in a new way so that any subject they talk about uh, uh, deepens connection, restores or deepens connections rather than rupturing connection. And so we call that dialogue. And dialogue is a literally new way of talking that’s just now appearing on the planet as a consciousness. Prior to um, the last 10, 15, 20 years, um the primary conversation, or put it another way, the primary conversation, structure of conversation in the history of the world, has been what we call a vertical conversation monologue. Two people talking, or one person talking and another person listening, two people talking, nobody listening. And that parallel monologues is what couples bring to therapy in that consequently that’s the source of conflict is that there is no engagement and no awareness of intersubjectivity or the inner subjectivity. So that we help couples move from monologue to dialogue. The content of most conversations in the history of the world has been judgmental. That is, someone is putting another person in a less than equal place in relationship to them. This is called the put-down. And all couples I’ve ever seen are masters at the put-down. And the put-down is anything from ‘What?’, um, to uh, uh, to, to physical abuse. Anything that makes you less than the person talking is a put-down. So you might think about how often today are you going to put people down. Anytime you do that it’s a judgment that this person needs to be informed by you. That you know how to inform them. And if they would listen to you, they would be a better person. And you’ll be a superior person because you helped a poorly defined or poor person become a better person. And couples do that all the time. You know, I, I remember hearing, ‘Well, go ahead and marry him and afterwards you can change him.’ Um, that there’s an assumption that we all need to be changed. So we move away from that, from um, judgment to curiosity. We help couples move to curiosity. And to um, acceptance. And to appreciation, affirmation, um, my wife and I Helen, have moved our level of conversation up to daily adoration. Um, which is an amazing experience to have every day and also ultimately to advocacy, that we are each other’s advocate rather than each other’s opponent. We become advocates, which creates emotional safety. Emotional safety is, essential to healing and growth. And when you’re safe, then your defenses, your anxiety goes down, your defenses relax, and you can then be vulnerable, open, and sharing in that safe place. And we think that is the healing wholeness creating conversation. And that it in fact is the conversation which if the caretakers had done it we call it empathic attunement. The word attunement’s been around a long time. Empathic or compassionate attunement. When that happens, you have in fact had the conversation which if the parents had had, you would not have had the wound that brought you into adult life and into this particular marriage. In other words, you all had been married to somebody else. Uh. But thank goodness that your parents wounded you so that you got to meet each other and find each other and get here, uh, to do this demonstration today, otherwise I would be without that. So, um, and most conversation that uh, marital therapists even have, is about what’s wrong with your relationship, let’s fix it. Uh, we do pay attention to conflict because, um, couples do. But primarily we want to pay attention to um, to connectional transactions. And so today instead of doing the BCR that we did last time five years ago, um, and showed you how to work with conflict, in the confines of this hour makes that exercise a bit scrimped. We’re going to an appreciation, or a caring behaviors exercise, to show you how we help couples move into affirmation uh, and therefore creating safety and ultimately, creating passion. So. Result in you being an initiator and you being a responder are defensive patterns that were used in childhood to regulate your anxiety about your caretakers and so we want to change those patterns and one way we start is simply by shifting the initiator to you instead of the responder and the responder to you. Now, um, Bill and Anne have been in Imago Therapy so you’ll hear some people who do what is going on instead of a fresh couple, uh, and they’ve modulated, uh, that polarity already. Uh, but we’re still gonna, gonna do that shift. So we want to, to do that start. Now. An Imago therapist always puts a couple face to face. Now we may, we may have a sofa, but we use it only for holding exercises or for physical touch, but primarily two chairs. This is the Imago Triad. The Imago therapist facilitates the process between the couple, does not actually do the therapy. We assume the therapy happens here. This is where the wounding is, this is where the healing has to be, and we facilitate the process by helping them struc, re-structure their conversation, from monologue to dialogue, from judgment to, um, affirmation and appreciation. Ok. That’s enough talking. So, um, the one other thing we do, we also ask couples to learn how to make appointments for conversations. Now, this is, I interpret this simply as civility. Um, but it has the therapeutic value for everyone, in, by make an appointment we mean, could you say something like, um, and I’ll give you a line and we’ll, but don’t do it right now, ‘Anne, uh, is now a good time? I have an, an appreciation I’d like to share with you. An appreciation of you I’d like to share, is now a good time?’ The reason is Anne might not be available emotionally or mentally right now, or physically. You might have to go to the bathroom, you know, there may be all kinds of reasons why now’s not a good time. And if you show up and enter her space without preparing her for you, then she may do a behavior that will in fact, reactivate her childhood memory of not being, of being ignored, or not paid attention to. So you recreate your own trauma. So we say, um, two things, sit down and look at each other in your room, you may be standing at, as it becomes more proficient, it’s just a way of being. But in the practice, you ask for an appointment. So Bill would you think about what you want to share and I’m gonna ask you to, as you’re thinking about it, to sort of think about dialogue as a meditation. And that we’re focus on a point, namely what, what you are, are thinking about is only affirmations, appreciations, and so forth. And we want you to breathe deeply and so you can oxygenate your brain, reduces your anxiety. We want you to do the same thing, Anne. You’re going to be the receiver, and the receiver is going to be focused only on one thing which is what you’re hearing, what’s being said. And what’s being said, if it, if you find yourself a little overloaded, like you’re not listening, but thinking and processing, then you raise your hand, call, call it pause button, or a clutch. I call it a clutch so that, course locates my age back when cars had clutches. So you raise your hand and what that means is a ‘Let me see if I’ve got that so far’. It doesn’t mean I’m done listening, it just means ‘I’m on overload, let me do that back.’ Because we want you to stay focused, stay relaxed, and stay connected. Ok. So let me know when you’re ready with your appreciation. 

00:14:55
BILL I’m ready. 

00:15:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX Ok. So would you make an appointment? 

00:15:00
BILL Anne, I’d like to make an, um, I’d like to have. 

00:15:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX We need, we need sound on this mic. 

00:15:05
BILL Can you hear me now? Oh, ok, sorry. 

00:15:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? Verizon at. 

00:15:15
BILL Anne, I’d like to have an appreciation dialogue with you. Is now a good time? 

00:15:15
ANNE Yes. 

00:15:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX So the thing I appreciate the most. It still needs a little more volume. His mic. Her mic needs more volume. 

00:15:30
BILL The thing I appreciate most is that we can dialogue about things that are bothering either you or myself or both of us. And do it in a safe context. 

00:15:45
ANNE So the thing you appreciate most is that we can dialogue about things that are bothering us and do it in a safe context. 

00:15:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX So I’m gonna ask you, um, if you will make it a little more personal? Something about her that you appreciate at the moment rather than the we? I like the we, but can you go to the you? The thing I appreciate most about you is. 

00:16:10
BILL The thing I appreciate most about you is that you listen to what I have to say, that I feel the freedom to tell you things now that I wouldn’t have years ago for fear of what your reaction might have been. 

00:16:35
ANNE So what you appreciate about me is. 

00:16:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, just to do the thing, so let me see if I got that. 

00:16:40
ANNE Ok. So let me see if I got that. 

00:16:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX So that they can hear the lead sentences. So let me see if I got that. 

00:16:40
ANNE Um, let me see if I’ve got that. You appreciate that I listen to you and that you can tell me things that um, you wouldn’t have been able to tell me years ago. 

00:16:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Did I get you? 

00:16:55
ANNE Did I get you? 

00:16:55
BILL Yes. 

00:16:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Is there more about that? 

00:16:55
ANNE Is there more about that? 

00:17:00
BILL Yes. Um, I I can tell you some of the fears that I have about day to day activities or our relationships or my relationships with other people that before I would have either taken to somebody else, Daryl for instance, or um, just kept inside and not said anything about it. 

00:17:30
ANNE Ok, let me see if I’ve got that. You, um, appreciate that you can talk to me about day to day, um, things that bother you, or things that bother you about our relationship that you used to, would’ve taken to others, um, for example Daryl. 

00:17:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Am I getting you? 

00:17:50
ANNE Am I getting that? 

00:17:55
BILL Yes. 

00:17:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Is there more about that? 

00:17:55
ANNE Is there more about that? 

00:17:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX And the that is always what he is saying, not some other topic, so you go deeper into the that. 

00:18:05
BILL Um. Things well, uh, specifically, uh, in, in today would be finances, um, your business, my business, um, how we’re doing now, how we’re doing in the future, um, and how that’s going to affect our relationship, are important to me. 

00:18:25
ANNE So let me see if I got that. So specifically, um, one example is finances. Your business, my business, how we’re doing now, how we’re going to do in the future and how that affects our relationship. Did I get that? 

00:18:45
BILL Yes. 

00:18:45
ANNE Is there more about this? 

00:18:45
BILL Um. 

00:18:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX So how, how that, what, what I feel when I think about that, how that makes me feel, is. 

00:19:00
BILL What I feel when I, when I think about the ability to be able to have dialogues with you about things that are bother me is a sense of, uh, safety. That you’ll listen to what I have to say, that you’ll give me the freedom to say I, and right or wrong, or, no, I shouldn’t say right or wrong but whether you agree or disagree with what I have to say, you’ll listen to what I have to say. And give me feedback. 

00:19:30
ANNE Ok. So when, what this makes you. Let me see if I got this. What this makes you feel like is just safe, that you can, um, tell me things whether I agree or disagree and that I will listen to you and that you feel safe, um, and that I will give you feedback. Did I get that? 

00:19:55
BILL Yes. 

00:19:55
ANNE Is there 

00:19:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX And so what that reminds me of? 

00:20:00
BILL What it reminds me of is exactly the opposite of what I grew up with where, um, my opinions were ok as long as they met what my parents expected it to be. And if didn’t agree with them, then it wasn’t an opinion worth having. 

00:20:25
ANNE Let me see if I got that. So what this reminds you of is something the exact opposite of what you got when you were growing up, um. That if you had an opinion it had to be, uh, it had to agree with what your parents thought otherwise it wasn’t, an opinion worth having. Did I get that? 

00:20:45
BILL Yes. 

00:20:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Is there more about that? 

00:20:50
ANNE Is there more about that? 

00:20:50
BILL Uh, yes, the, the safety of being able to have a conversation or a dialogue is also totally different than what I grew up with. Um, what I grew up with were shouting matches and one person, well my parents, between my parents and one person, one of them proving that the other one was wrong instead of listening. And through the dialogue and the safety that I get from the dialogue structure, I feel the freedom to disagree with you, and to express my own opinions without having to worry about recourse of what your reaction might be. 

00:21:30
ANNE  Ok. So let me see if I got that. Um, one thing that is different is it feels safe because when you were growing up, um, there were shouting matches between your parents where they were proving that each other were wrong and you just have the safety to disagree with me and I listen. Did I get that? 

00:21:55
BILL Yes. 

00:22:00
ANNE Is there more about this? 

00:22:00
BILL No, that’s pretty good. 

00:22:00
ANNE Ok. 

00:22:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, let me see that, if I got it all. So can you kind of give him a summary of all that he’s said? 

00:22:10
ANNE So let me see if I got it all. In summary what you’re saying is you really appreciate that, um, you can, I will listen. That you can talk to me and we can have dialogues. And that you can tell me about things that are bothering you, um, for example, things about our finances and where our businesses are going. And that it feels safe, even if I don’t agree with you. And what this reminds you of, from childhood, is how this didn’t happen in your family, there were screaming matches with your parents trying to make each other wrong, um, and also that if you had an opinion, it didn’t really matter, your opinion wasn’t worth having unless it, um, agreed with their opinions. Um. 

00:23:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX So did I get it all? 

00:23:10
ANNE Did I get it all? 

00:23:10
BILL Yes. 

00:23:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX So would that make sense, and what makes sense is… 

00:23:15
ANNE That makes sense and what makes sense is, is that, um, to feel, that you feel safe when I listen, even if I disagree. That we have a dialogue process where, um, you don’t feel like I’m making you wrong just because I disagree. And that your opinion does matter to me. 

00:23:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX And it makes sense why you would appreciate that, given your childhood. 

00:23:45
ANNE It makes sense that you would appreciate me listening to you, given your childhood. 

00:23:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX So did I get that? 

00:23:55
ANNE Did I get that? 

00:23:55
BILL Yes. 

00:24:00
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, I can imagine- the empathy piece. I can imagine, when you think about that, (crosstalk) must be ol- 

00:24:05
ANNE (crosstalk) I imagine when you think about that, you must feel safe. Um. Secure. Loved. And valued. 

00:24:25
BILL Um, I feel safe. I feel secure, valued, and grateful that, um, grateful that I can appreciate our relationship in context with what our parents, or what we grew, what I grew up with. 

00:24:50
ANNE So you feel safe, valued, secure, and also, um, can appreciate our relationship being different that what you grew up with. 

00:25:05
BILL Yes. 

00:25:10
ANNE (crosstalk) Did I, did I get that? 

00:25:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX (crosstalk) Did I get that? 

00:25:10
BILL Yes. 

00:25:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX So thank you for sharing. 

00:25:15
ANNE So thank you for sharing. 

00:25:15
BILL You’re welcome. 

00:25:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX And thank you for listening. 

00:25:15
BILL Thank you for listening. 

00:25:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX Ok. So you knew the structure is to mirror and then in the mirroring you say, ‘let me see if I got that’, uh, ‘did I get it’, uh, ‘is there more’- there’s always the check and the ‘is there more’ is the critical deepening piece. Because most of us after our partner says something, sort of say ‘are you done yet?’ And so we didn’t have our turn, so instead the partner is, uh, coached, and uh, into deepening the conversation, moving it then affect and then moving it into memory. And so forth. So now we’re going to switch, uh, and have you uh, think of an appreciation that you have for Bill. And before you do that, um, would you make the appointment and then, um, I’ll give you a lead line. 

00:26:15
ANNE Ok. I’d like to have an appreciation dialogue. Is now a good time? 

00:26:20
BILL Yes. 

00:26:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX And so what comes up for me when I hear your appreciation of me is… 

00:26:25
ANNE What comes up for me when I hear your appreciation for me, um, is how much I appreciate your sense of humor, even when we are dialoging about something really heavy or sad. 

00:26:45
BILL So what you appreciate about me, let me see if I got that. What you appreciate about me is my sense of humor even if we’re in disagreement or 

00:26:55
ANNE No, talking about something heavy, or sad. 

00:27:00
BILL Even if we’re talking about something heavy or sad. 

00:27:05
ANNE Um. 

00:27:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX Did I get it? 

00:27:05
BILL Did, did I get it? 

00:27:05
ANNE Yes. Um. 

00:27:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX And is there more? 

00:27:10
BILL Is there more? 

00:27:10
ANNE Yes. For example, um, I appreciate that you had some humor when we were in, especially in one of our dialogues about, um, the wedding, um, where you were, um, you were really talking about your sadness about what happened, but also kind of tying it in to, huh, how your mother had behaved at our wedding and. 

00:28:00
BILL So let me see if I got this right. Um, you appreciate the humor that I had about Paul and Melissa’s wedding. Um, and my actions at that wedding, or lack thereof, um, and how I related that to how my mother acted at our wedding. 

00:28:20
ANNE Yes. And, and the piece that I hold onto as really touching and humorous was when you told me all’s you would’ve needed was a blue dress. 

00:28:30
BILL So let me see if I got that right. Um. What, the piece that, that you hold onto is the comment that I made about my mother and at my reactions was all I needed was a blue dress. 

00:28:45
ANNE Yes. Kind of as a symbol of, um, just some of the behaviors, um. And your humor has, has helped me, um, just get past my sadness about some of that. 

00:29:10
BILL So, so let me see if I get this, get you. Um. My humor in this situation has helped you deal with some of your feelings about what happened at the wedding. 

00:29:30
ANNE Yes. Um, actually helped me get past my sadness about. 

00:29:35
BILL Helped you get past your sadness about the wedding. 

00:29:35
ANNE Yeah. Um. And your humor really has been even over the years, has been something that I could count on, um even in the hardest situations. 

00:29:55
BILL/ So, so my humor over the years has helped you get through some of the hard times and some of the sad situations. 

00:30:05
ANNE Um, yes. 

00:30:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX So is there more? 

00:30:10
BILL So is there more? 

00:30:15
ANNE Mmm, no, not really. 

00:30:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX So, but when I think about your humor, I feel… 

00:30:20
ANNE When I think about your humor, I feel lighter, um, I feel loving, because there was nothing funny when I was growing up. 

00:30:45
BILL So let me see if I got this. So when you think about my humor it helps you feel loving and, um, it, because you didn’t grow, there was nothing funny and humorous about you when you were growing up. 

00:31:00
ANNE Um, in our immediate family, anyways. Cuz I do remember my mother was really funny when she was like with her sisters. 

00:31:15
BILL So let me see if I got this right. What you’re saying is your mother was, your mother was funny, and in her immediate family was, there was humor in your immediate family, that your mother was also funny? 

00:31:30
ANNE No. 

00:31:30
BILL Can you repeat that, please? 

00:31:30
ANNE There was no humor in my immediate family. 

00:31:35
BILL Oh, ok. There was no humor in your immediate family. 

00:31:35
ANNE But I do remember my mother being funny when she was with her sisters. 

00:31:40
BILL But you do remember your mother being funny when she was with your sisters. 

00:31:45
ANNE But not with us. Not with us kids. Not with me. 

00:31:50
BILL But not with the kids and not with you. 

00:31:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX So is there more about that? 

00:31:55
BILL So is there more about that? 

00:31:55
ANNE Um. 

00:31:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yeah, tell him some more about what it was like to be a child in your family. 

00:32:00
ANNE It was always so serious. Um. Um. If, if there was any kind of, can’t call it dialogue, but a monologue, it was really always serious and about something that was wrong. Um. 

00:32:20
BILL So if there was any dialogue or monologue, it was always about something that was wrong. 

00:32:30
ANNE So this is lightness to me when you’re funny even in heavy situations. 

00:32:35
BILL So this is lightness to you when I’m funny, even in heavy situations. 

00:32:40
ANNE Yes. 

00:32:45
BILL Is there more? 

00:32:45
ANNE Mmm. 

00:32:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX So let me see if I’ve got it all. 

00:32:50
BILL So let me see if I’ve got it all. So in summary, um, what you’re saying is that my humor in our relationship has, even when things are rough, um, or we’re having bad times, is, um, it is, a good thing because it’s helped us get through some bad times. Um, as, specifically as it relates to the wedding, and my actions during the wedding, um. My humor in addressing certain situations has helped you to deal with some of your feelings about what came out of the wedding and as we dialogued about the difficulties that I had, it, it helped you to deal with some of your anger and frustrations over what happened at the wedding. And in relationship to what you grew up with where things were not funny in your household, you did experience your mother being funny with her sisters and that, um, my being, more what you like about me being funny is that it does help us address some tough issues and, and, deal with things. Is that a good summary? 

00:34:25
ANNE Yes. And it has helped me get past some of my sadness. 

00:34:30
BILL And it’s helped you get past some of your sadness. 

00:34:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX Am I getting that now? 

00:34:30
BILL Am I getting that now? 

00:34:30
ANNE Yes. 

00:34:35
BILL Yes. 

00:34:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX So that makes sense, and what makes sense about what you said is about, about what you appreciate about me. 

00:34:40
BILL Um, so that makes sense, and what makes sense about what you appreciate about me is that um, humor has been somewhat of a release for both of us, um, and, and when things are tough or tense, um, I have the ability sometimes right, sometimes wrong to bring humor into the situation, um, and so do you. And, and, and. 

00:35:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX Now, and just stay with her, now. 

00:35:20
BILL Ok. 

00:35:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX But, and not add anything to what she said. Just stay with her. It makes sense that you would appreciate my humor because. 

00:35:30
BILL It makes sense that you would appreciate my humor, um, to be able to talk about things that are tough when you couldn’t do it as a child. So, I, I appreciate that about what you said. 

00:35:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX So did, did I get that piece right? 

00:35:40
BILL Did I get that piece right? 

00:35:45
ANNE Yes. 

00:35:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX And I can imagine that given that you might be feeling. 

00:35:50
BILL I can imagine given that you might be feeling, uh, happy, or, or, or content, um, sad at the thought of maybe you’re, you’re childhood sadness and relieved that you could tell me about it. Is that what you’re feeling? 

00:36:15
ANNE Um. I feel some contentment, um, I feel safe, um, and there was sadness. 

00:36:30
BILL So you feel some contentment, safe, and some sadness. 

00:36:35
ANNE Yes. 

00:36:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Am I getting all your feelings? 

00:36:40
BILL Am I getting all your feelings? 

00:36:40
ANNE Yes. 

00:36:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX Are there any other feelings? 

00:36:45
BILL Are there any other feelings? 

00:36:45
ANNE Not about this. 

00:36:45
BILL Ok. 

00:36:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX So thank you for sharing. 

00:36:50
BILL So thank you for sharing. 

00:36:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Thank you for listening. 

00:36:50
ANNE Thank you for listening. 

00:36:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX And so, would you share with her what comes up for you when you hear your humor being appreciated? How does that touch you? And tell her that. So when I hear you telling me about my humor… 

00:37:05
BILL When I hear you telling me about my humor, it, it’s comforting on one hand to know that you appreciate it now, because years ago, maybe not so much. Um. It, years ago it would’ve been, um, ‘why are you trying to make something funny out of a serious situation?’ and ‘you can’t be serious about what I’m telling you.’ Whereas now I think, it sometimes bridges the gaps that we have in our relationship and actually brings us closer together. 

00:37:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX So let me see if I’ve got that. 

00:37:45
ANNE Let me see if I got that. Um, so, what this, how this touches you, that I appreciate your humor is that you think in the past, maybe I would not have been, um, so appreciative of your humor and now it really helps us bridges, bridge the gap and be closer together. Did I get that? 

00:38:10
BILL Yes. 

00:38:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX Is there anything more about that? 

00:38:15
ANNE Is there any more about that? 

00:38:20
BILL I, I think that knowing a little more about the sadness that was in your family, or the lack of humor in your family, helps me understand sometimes when you’re funny and I might not understand it. 

00:38:40
ANNE So, um, you think that, um, now that you, that knowing this helps, helps you realize that, um, sometimes when I’m funny, um, and you don’t acknowledge it because there was no humor in my childhood, or very little, um, that you recognize that it’s important to recognize my humor, too. Did I get that? 

00:39:15
BILL Yes. 

00:39:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX And more? 

00:39:15
ANNE Is there any more? 

00:39:20
BILL I’m good. 

00:39:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX And so, what comes up for me when I hear that is… 

00:39:25
ANNE Um, what comes up for me when I hear that is appreciation that you’ll start thinking I’m funny. Um. 

00:39:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX So mirror that back. 

00:39:40
BILL So what, um, what you appreciate about that is that I now will start appreciating you and thinking that you’re funny. 

00:39:50
ANNE Yeah. 

00:39:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Is there more about that? 

00:39:50
BILL  Is there more about that? 

00:39:55
ANNE No. 

00:39:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Ok. So we’ll bring it to a close. Um, and thank you very much for being willing to, um, demonstrate this, this process and this exercise and being vulnerable before all these people. 

00:40:15
ANNE Our closest friends. 

00:40:15
HARVILLE HENDRIX Thank you so much. So one thing that, um, that we have, uh, a little time to do is would you be willing to share since you all have done this here and also outside of here some, but sort of share what it’s like to do this. Um, share with the audience what it’s like to engage in this kind of highly structured, uh. Let me make one comment about that before they respond. I think about dialogue training as I think about training to go skiing. That you have to learn the snowplow on the bunny slope before you go to the beginner’s slope. And if you don’t, uh, you’re probably dead. Uh, or at least injured. And so that there’s a structure here, highly structured. And then as the structure becomes practiced, that, uh, both partners will talk dialogically without using the particularities of the structure because it’s become integrated. And I don’t know you all other than this morning about how long you all have been in dialogue and how integrated the structure is into your process and how spontaneous it may have become, um. But aside from all that, just what is it like to, um, to be in a dialogical space with a partner? Just any comments about that? 

00:41:55
ANNE Yeah. Um, it was very hard at first, cuz you really, I, I like that metaphor, you really do have to stop yourself cuz it’s really hard to be a listener, and to not be reactive when you’re disagreeing with what the other’s saying, because been so trained to, you know, get your point across and defend so that really was true. That was just, it, it was like grueling almost at first to just get ourselves, cuz we were pretty conflicted. So to, to be a listener, um, and it was probably just as hard for me to learn to, um, not use it to beat him over the head, too. Just cuz I-(crosstalk) 

00:42:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX (crosstalk)Oh, like you’re not dialoging. Yeah. 

00:42:50
ANNE I know. Um, to learn to dialogue from an ‘I’ place. 

00:42:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX From an ‘I’ place. 

00:42:55
ANNE To really learn to own my own feelings and not blame his whatever his behavior for me. So to really. Um. And it has become easier. And it’s also become much deeper. 

00:43:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX Easier and deeper. 

00:43:15
ANNE Easier and deeper. As we’ve, um, gotten better at the process we were able to just go into deeper stuff. 

00:43:25
HARVILLE HENDRIX So at the start it was hard. Because you were in a reactive mode. 

00:43:30
ANNE Mmm-hmm. 

00:43:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX And waiting for your point across. But over time, that, uh, that’s become easier to do that, and, and you’ve become deeper in your dialogues. I assume that’s becoming more open, more vulnerable. 

00:43:40
ANNE Yes. 

00:43:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX And sharing more tender things. 

00:43:45
ANNE Yes. 

00:43:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Scary things. 

00:43:45
ANNE Scary things. 

00:43:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX Scary things. 

00:43:45
ANNE Yeah. Um. Painful things. 

00:43:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX And painful things. 

00:43:50
ANNE Yeah. And to know the other person, to know Bill is going to be there and, and be really attentive and it’s not going to scare him into his shell. Um. 

00:44:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX So you’ve become more safe in sharing scary things because when you do, Bill stays present, he doesn’t go into the shell he used to go in, he now stays present. 

00:44:20
ANNE Mmm-hmm. 

00:44:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX So the safety helps you actually go deeper. 

00:44:20
ANNE Yes. 

00:44:20
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yeah. Ok. And Bill? 

00:44:25
BILL I would agree with that. When, when we first starting Imago, our marriage was done. 

00:44:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Done. 

00:44:35
BILL I didn’t know it at the time, but it was done. 

00:44:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX You don’t mean like, you don’t mean like finished like baking, ready to, um. 

00:44:40
BILL No, no, no, no, no. I… 

00:44:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX You mean. 

00:44:45
BILL I had… 

00:44:45
ANNE No, like the cake fell. 

00:44:45
HARVILLE HENDRIX The cake fell. 

00:44:45
BILL I had one foot out the door and the other one was halfway there. Um. 

00:44:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Oh. 

00:44:50
BILL When, when we started Imago we, we didn’t talk, well, we didn’t we certainly didn’t dialogue- we talked at each other. Um. And it was difficult for me that, the, the first time that we went, um, after not really talking at all and we had a very structured, ‘say this,’ ‘say that,’ ‘do this,’ ‘do that’ and I was like, ‘ah, hell no.’ I just, I need to say what’s on my mind and I need to get what I feel. Everything was basically ‘me, me, me, me, me’ and I need to do this, and do that. Um. And it was the training that I had had as a kid with my parents fighting with each other about, you know, proving who was never wrong, or who was always right. And, and, so I really, really, really struggled with that initially. Um. And it, and it took some time for me to let go of a lot of the anger that I had, and, and actually get into the format of the dialogue. And it took a while for me to realize that through the dialogue process, I could as opposed to retreating into a shell when things bothered me, I could have the freedom to discuss or dialogue with Anne about the things that were really, really bother me, bothering me and know that she would be there to listen. Um. And, and that, I would have the space and the time to say whatever was on my mind. And so the, the, the dialogue really helps me touch on issues that I otherwise would not even talk about. Or would be afraid to talk about. So I really appreciate the structure and the safety that the um, process and the dialogue allows me. Or, or offers me. 

00:46:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX So when you go to, to, to Bruce, um you were out of the marriage one foot and another one following behind you. 

00:46:50
BILL Oh yeah. Yeah. 

00:46:50
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yeah. 

00:46:50
BILL We, I, I referred, well there are many times during sessions with a group with Bruce that I’ve put my foot in my mouth, a few times, so. Um. It, it, it’s been a long growing process but it’s certainly has helped. 

00:47:05
HARVILLE HENDRIX And so you struggled, too, like Anne did, to- but you were angry, and you really wanted to freely talk and it’s cuz the models you’d seen in childhood sounds like when you said that, were people yelling at each other, so just getting their feelings out. And so finally you got um, comfortable with the structure and began to feel more facile with it, and feel a little safer. Am I tracking that? 

00:47:30
BILL Um, yes, um. In my household, my parents fought all the time, 24/7. They would fight whether or not it was day or night, what time of day, I mean, they, they fought over everything. And so my reaction in our relationship when as opposed to fighting, I would just shut up and I would, and I would just, or I’d be passive-aggressive or I’d, I’d just would, I would just disconnect. 

00:47:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Just disconnect. 

00:48:00
BILL And the Imago, when we first went, I had been shut down for so long that Bruce kind of gave me some keys to a car and I was ready to drive but he wanted to, to teach us how to drive and I, I didn’t want to learn how to drive, I just wanted to drive. So. 

00:48:10
HARVILLE HENDRIX You just wanted to drive. Yeah. 

00:48:15
BILL Um. So, so, my inclination is to withdraw as opposed to, you know, being confrontational and, and the Imago has allowed me the freedom to, um, say what’s on my mind in a safe, in a safe environment. 

00:48:30
HARVILLE HENDRIX So moving from the withdrawal, we kind of call those turtles in the Imago, going into their shell. You’re now coming out into this, into this space. 

00:48:40
BILL True. 

00:48:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX And sharing. 

00:48:40
BILL Yes. 

00:48:40
HARVILLE HENDRIX So one of the things- thank you for sharing that, as a piece of vulnerable history that I didn’t anticipate your saying it but I’m delighted that you would do that- so just conceptually, we think that a couple’s changing the structure of their conversation and changing the content of that conversation actually changes the relationship so that most issues that couples have are dissolved in the new conversation. So instead of having to go to problem-solving, most problems are functions of disconnection and all of the, uh, fear and anger around that, and when the connection occurs, there’s a kind of dropping in issues because the issues were about not being connected. So sometimes we have to go to behaviors and change a behavior that’s long-standing, but most of the time the restoration of connection, um, resolves most, most issues. Now I think that last thing before we close up is that, uh, just to remind you, it’s moved from vertical to horizontal, from judgment to affirmation, changes the structure and that repairs and restores. And what we ultimately want to help couples do through the dialogue process is end all negative transactions. I don’t know where you all are on that continuum now, but negativity is disconnectional. So any transaction that disconnects has to be removed from the conversation. Some couples can do that in a day or two, some take two or three years to do that. Um. Depends on the level of their wounded. And move from, um, that, um, judgmental, negative place into this affirming place, is ultimately the way you engage otherness and I think that differentiation of self from the other through the listening process makes it possible then to really connect. 

00:50:55
ANNE Mmm-hmm. 

00:50:55
HARVILLE HENDRIX Um, and otherness is ultimately the goal and to be safe with this other person. And that all that can happen through changing the structure. And the content of conversation. So thank you, very much, for coming all the way down here, uh, to do this with us. And Bruce, I want to thank you, for getting them here. You are amazing. You are amazing! And you all are amazing, so’s let’s say it- We Are Amazing! Come on! Come on, therapists, say it! 

00:51:30
ANNE are 

00:51:30
BILL We are amazing. 

00:51:35
HARVILLE HENDRIX Yourselves. Or say I am amazing. Ok. Therapists, have, uh, some, uh, reserve about their self-acceptance. Um. Ok. We’re at nine o’clock, thank you for coming, and thank you for being here and good day. 

00:51:55
