JENNIFER L ABEL Good afternoon. Welcome to the art of perfecting muscle relaxation, alleviate tension, pain, fatigue, insomnia, and more. I'm Dr Jennifer Abel, and umm… I don't have any conflicts of interest. I don't work for any pharmaceutical companies or behavioral health companies, other than Pesi, uh… that can benefit from the seminar. You are missing the title page, umm… so my apologies for that and there are a couple, of uh… minor differences between what you are going to be seeing, and what, umm… I'm going to be talking about, umm… but I think you'll be able to figure that out. Uh… so we're going to start with progressive relaxation, because progressive relaxation is the gold standard for muscle relaxation. And it involves systematically tensing and relaxing the muscles. And a little background on it, it was invented by a Russian physiologist, by the name of Edmund Jacobson, in the 1930s, and then Joseph Wolpe perfected it in the 1950s. Umm… when Edmund Jacobson had invented the procedure, it took two hours. So, you can imagine that adherence was really poor, uh… that people did not comply with it the very, very well. And then Bernstein, and Borkovec, further perfected it, and there, uh… the two that developed the manual that is most used for progressive relaxation. Uh… a little bit of background about my experiences with progressive relaxation, I actually learned this before I knew that I wanted to become a psychologist, I was a music student and had too much tension when I was playing, and it really helped me. And uh… then when I went to grad school, I learned, uh… progressive relaxation how to actually train other people to do it, and then, umm… I actually worked with Borkovec of for my post doc, and umm… ended up being the umm… associate professor, umm… and the associate director of the stress and anxiety disorders Institute there in Penn State. And I realize that very few people really know how to do this procedure well. Many people just start with the toes and say tense your toes, and let them relax. Tense your lower legs, and let them relax. And the procedure is much more involved and can be much more effective if you do it the way that Bernstein, and Borkovec intended. So umm… the rationale for training people to do this is that it lowers our adaptation level, the adaptation level is the amount of tension that we used to get throughout the day. Most people, if not almost every one uses more tension than they need to drive a car, to type on the computer, to walk across the parking lot, uh… and when we lower our adaptation level and use only the amount of tension that we need to get through the day that leads to several salubrious effects. And uh… some of the benefits of progressive relaxation include that it reduces and often eliminates tension headaches. I've had a couple of clients who said that they had daily headaches they were completely finished with headaches, after learning, uh… progressive muscle relaxation. And while autogenic training and thermal biofeedback works better for migraines. I've seen people have a great reduction and sometimes elimination of migraines from learning progressive muscle relaxation. It also decreases blood pressure significantly. Uh… 16 millimeters of mercury in the systolic, and umm… insomnia, it decreases sleep onset time by an average of 60% in insomniacs, and now this is self report, uh… and actually being recorded in a sleep uh… study. And uh… fatigue, we don't have, uh… any studies at least none that I could find that indicates that it reduces fatigue. But I've had a lot of success with it. And my favorite story about it is a young woman who saw me at Penn State umm… who was worried that with her chronic fatigue syndrome, that she would never be able to graduate from college, that she wouldn't be able to have a career, that she wouldn't be able to have kids. And not only did I teach her progressive relaxation, instead of throughout the day thinking about the least amount of tension, we talked about energy conservation, using the least amount energy. She wrote me more than ten years later, and said that not only was she able to get through school, she ended up getting an advanced degree, and she was married, and had three children, and had a career, and she said her energy was fine. And I thought that's a minor miracle, because most people who have a career and three kids, their energy is not fine. Uh… social satisfaction, uh… turns out that "Frankie Goes to Hollywood" was right, you know, that song relax, umm… When I teach my live seminars, there's always at least a few people who give me a confused look, so I end up singing it, so I'll go ahead and sing it for you too, uh… then you'll probably recognize that. Relax, don't do it, when you want to go to it. Relax, don't do it, when you want to come. And then umm… also chronic pain when we uh… experience pain, our tendency is to tense our muscles, perhaps to guard against having further pain. And when we use those pain signals as a reminder to loosen our muscles, we actually experience significantly less pain and that's been well documented. Umm… I have also at a conference heard of a study or read a study that indicated that people actually need less anesthesia when going through, umm… umm… surgery. So it really does something significant to the nervous system to help to calm it down. Umm… so before actually doing the training, we want to give the client a brief rationale uh… for why… what we're going to do the next week. And that most effective relaxation procedure that… this is the most effective relaxation procedure, and then what I usually do is I'll talk about the proceeding symptoms, the ones that match what they're experiencing. So for instance, if amongst their complaints are headaches and insomnia, then I will cite the umm… the studies on those problems, and say that once they learn those, they'll have a 60% reduction, up to a 60% reduction, an average of 60% reduction, and uh… insomnia, and a decrease in tension headaches. And umm… I also ask, you're gonna ask the client to wear loose comfortable clothing, before they come in, and to use the restroom before the session. Uh… because it's really difficult to relax if you have to use restroom. And then prepare the client ahead of time that the procedure is going to take the full hour, sometimes it doesn't take the full hour, but sometimes it actually takes a little bit longer. Umm… so let them know in advance that there won't be any time to discuss anything else. And I always let them know if they change their mind and they have something during the week that they feel like they just really need to talk about that they can postpone the procedure to the next time. And then we want to have the make a commitment to practice 20 minutes a day, now that's uh… an investment in their time for two weeks. Because after two weeks, like and every other skill, we have better and better at it, and some of those skills, we can take shortcuts. And this is one of those times that we can actually take short cuts in uh… doing progressive muscle relaxation. So the first week, umm… we start with 16 different muscle groups and umm… and giving the background takes three to five minutes, and then having them get comfortable, you want to have them take off their shoes, and you want to make sure that they're comfortable, uh… with the temperature and if not I have a blanket on hand or ask that they might remove their outer shirt and use their t-shirt or whatever, uh… to get a more comfortable, uh… position, a comfortable temperature. And then demonstrate the 16 muscle groups which I'm going to demonstrate to you in a few minutes, and it takes about 30 to 40 minutes to do the procedure, and then it takes time, uh… usually about five minutes to debrief them. And I'll go into detail about all of the steps. I just want to give you a preview if you will. So uh… provide that background from Jacobson to Wolpe to Bernstein, and Borkovec, uh… hint, this is one of the questions on your post test. And umm… we want to use the rationale of lowering the adaptation level, and that umm… lowering the adaptation level. I'd have talk about all of the benefits, even if it may not be something that they're having an issue with. I, I think it helps them to really have confidence in the procedure, and that this can make a huge difference in people's lives. And uh… again highlighting those that apply to the client, and that we will tense and release 16 different muscle groups in the body. So, a lot of clients will wonder umm… and they might even ask "Well, why are we going to tense our muscles, if the goal is to relax them?" And there's actually three reasons why we want to tense the muscles. First, one is momentum, it turns out that if we tense muscles first, we can actually get them much more relaxed than if we just think of letting go of the muscles and relaxing them. The other thing is that we want people to be keenly aware of tension, and keenly aware of the difference between tension and relaxation, so that they're noticing the tension when they feel it, and what better way to notice that difference than to have them side by side, tense then relaxed. And then um… it's a way of practicing letting go of tension. we'll do each muscle group at least twice, and during the demonstration, uh… each one once at least, so people will get at least 48 practices that day in letting go of their tension. Then, uh… we want to verify that they've used the restroom beforehand, uh… that we want… we want to lower the lights, if you have a window, sometimes it's best to just turn off all the lights and just use the natural light. And then you want to use recline… the recliner or a couch, umm… and what I ask people is "Where do you think you'll be practicing this at home?" And I have a couch you want to have a couch that's much longer than this, the couch is too short for progressive relaxation? Uh… and some people may say that the practice it on the floor, if they practice it in the recliner then you can have them mimic something that's like a recliner by putting a pillow underneath their knees and having them sit uh… partway up, uh… at an angle, but I try to uh… to mimic the situation where they're going to be practicing as best as possible. Regardless of where you have them, the most important thing is that their head and neck is supported. So, if you do not have a couch or recliner, it's okay, it's not absolutely necessary. But what you do want to do is use pillows like this to support the head and neck, so we could do progressive relaxation like this on a couch like this or a chair as long as we have the wall behind, and the ability to put a pillow behind to relax the head and neck. And then umm… make sure that the clients aren't having to hold up their arms. So, for instance with this, that's not an issue, but for a skinny couch umm… you want… you don't want the person to have to be holding up their arm like this on the couch with their muscles. It should be that they're umm… that they're umm… able to rest this, so I take off the cushions from the back of my couch, so that they have plenty of room to uh… rest their arms. And then it's best if supine or partially supine, but again don't sweat it if you don't have that, you can use a pillow to support the head and neck. And some older clients will like pillows under their knees because of lower back issues, umm… and well anyone might want those, but I find the older clients particularly are more comfortable with that. When tensing the muscle groups, you want to tell them to tense the muscles hard, but not as hard as they can. Clients can complain of being sore if they tense too hard during the procedure. I like to say around 80% of maximum and umm… even ask clients to experiment, try 50%, try 90%, but avoid tensing as hard as you can. It should never cause pain. So, before you start you wanna ask the client if they have any pain issues, if they have at neck or back, and then let them know that they should not… it should not cause them pain if it causes pain for them to back off. It's not MPT in physical therapy, I will ask them what their uh… PT exercises are, and may integrate those even if it's stretching instead the tensing into the progressive relaxation, instead of using the classic forms of tensing the muscles. Let them know that they're going to do every muscle group at least twice. I think I mention this later, but umm… when they're at home, if they get the muscles completely relaxed after one time they don't have to do it a second time. Uh… but we want to do it twice, in the initial session, so they can feel if it's getting more relaxed if, if they feel more relaxed different second time. Uh… focusing your attention on the muscle group, sometimes people have difficulty focusing and uh… just to ask that if they start to lose focus just reminding themselves to focus on that muscle group that you're on. And we want to isolate the muscle group, and I'll show you a little bit more about that later, but umm… if you're tensing one muscle group, there may be residual tension from the adjoining muscles, but we should avoid uh… tensing other muscle groups for the most part. So, progressive relaxation is a skill, it is not magic, it's not hypnotism. Let people know this, because I think that some clients are particularly concerned about losing control and being controlled particularly those who have post-traumatic stress disorder, or post-traumatic significant post-traumatic stress. So, if you let them know that they will be choosing to tense the muscles and relaxing those muscles that can be helpful. And like any other skill, the more we practice that the better we get, and it takes about two weeks to maximize the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation. And then after that we'll be able to take shortcuts, so let them know that this isn't a lifelong commitment to 20 minutes, umm… 20 minutes a day that it's really only two weeks that you want them to commit to about 20 minutes a day. So bigger time commitment early on with less and less time commitment over time. So, again, we don't want to tense too hard, because we don't want people to get sore and or strain or cause pain, and watch that they are isolating the muscle group. The muscle group, what's most difficult to isolate is probably the upper arm, so when pressing into the surfaces, often times you'll see people tense their entire body or at least their torso. Umm… and you want to make sure that they're letting go of the tension in their forearm, umm… so and if they're, they're not able to do that, then I ask them to tense a little bit less hard, so that they're not tensing the rest of their body. So we're gonna start with the dominant uh… forearm, and uh… we want to just simply make a fist with the, the hand, the first the hand, umm… so you last, and so they're going to most times they're going to be supine, so umm… we want to… I don't know if you could see this with my computer up here, umm… make a fist and just… so you're resting the arm while you're making that fist. The second one is is the, the upper arm, and we don't want to bend, instead we want to just press that elbow in to the surfaces down into the surfaces, while letting the rest of the body be completely relaxed. But you know, you're going to get some of the shoulder just like when you're doing the forearm, you're going to get some in the upper arm, and that's all right. So, umm… the, the third one is the do the non-dominant forearm, and then the… and then the dominant, the non-dominant upper arm and umm… then we're going to go to the forehead. So umm… I let clients know that they're not going to have to remember all of these muscle groups while they're doing the procedure that day, but that they want to remember it before they leave. So uh… to, to kind of help to get them started with that memory process, I explained it's two in the right or two in the left if they're left handed, two in umm… the non-dominant, and then we go from top to bottom. So, they'll be three in the face, one in the neck, two in the torso, and then two in the leg, one in the foot. And so the next one is the forehead, and we're going to raise the eyebrows as if surprised, but I ask clients to practice that with their eyes closed, because they're going to have the eyes closed during the procedure. And then the middle part of the face, I have found that occasionally I get complaints that people get headaches, slight headaches from this, so umm… I ask people to scrunch their eyes only about 50%, and scrunch that they can scrunch their nose and cheeks as much as they want. And that's what that looks like. I let them know, I'm going to be making the faces right along with them, so that they're not as self-conscious about making these faces. And then the lower part of the face, umm… we're gonna make a big fake smile, press the teeth to the roof of… uh… press the teeth together without clenching, and press the tongue to the roof of the mouth, so it looks like this. And then umm… the neck, the neck is a little difficult, it's a little bit different. We're going to counterpoise the muscles. It's as if the back of the neck in the front of the neck were in tug of war. The back of the neck is trying to bring the chin forward, while the front of the neck is resisting that. And umm… then the upper torso is also kind of complicated, umm… you're going to have the person take a deep breath, high into the lungs, even though you may teach Diaphragmatic breathing, they have, may have learned to breathe deeply for this exercise, we want them to take a deep breath, high into the lungs, and pull the shoulders back, as if you're trying to meet the shoulder blades. And then the next one is just tightening the tummy, as is if you're going to hit yourself in the stomach or as if a little kid's going to hit you in the stomach. And umm… and then after that… then will go to the legs. So umm… pull, pull this down a little bit again. So the umm… the leg should be umm… straight, and you can push up and down counterpoising just like we did with the neck, pushing the leg up and down at the same time. That's the way Bernstein and Borkovec do it. I found that people tend to like this other way better to begin to lift the leg or lift the leg and pull it in toward the self, like this, that way we also get the performance through the buttocks, in addition to uh… the quadriceps and the hamstring. And umm… sorry about that, and then we do the lower leg. And the lower leg we want to umm… I'm going to show you, we're, we're going to pigeon toe and we're going to pull the foot back. But we want to keep the leg rested on the couch, so that we're not uh… so that we're minimally tensing the upper leg umm… so it looks like this. And then the foot umm… is pointing the toes and curling the toes under, again keeping the leg down. Because sometimes, people want to lift their, their upper leg and their lower leg when they're doing the foot or their upper leg when they're doing the lower umm… leg. And then of course we go to the non-dominant umm… upper leg, the non-dominant lower leg, and then the non-dominant foot. Okay. So there's an advantage to avoiding any unnecessary muscle groups. And we want to let our client know that if they get uncomfortable, by all means have them reposition to get more comfortable. If umm… but uh… they want to avoid unnecessary things like drumming their fingers or tapping their foot, so keeping still is useful. Umm… occasionally you'll get a client who'll say uh… maybe someone with a DHD or just someone who just feels like they need to move, if they insist that it causes them more anxiety to move, let them move, but that's rare that's, that's really pretty rare. And there's also an advantage to not talking, so we're going to communicate through finger signals. And umm… the finger signal is just to, have them raise their index finger, uh… where you can see it. And umm… we'll talk a little bit more about that uh… So we want to say wait until, umm… I tend… I say tense those muscles now, because otherwise it can throw off your timing. And so, for instance, and this is what I'll say to the client, so for instance, I might say "Soon we're going to tense the muscles in your forehead." Don't do it yet. "By tensing umm… by raising your eyebrows, tense those muscles now," that's when you want to do it. And then it'll be fairly obvious, I like to say relaxing or releasing rather than relax or release, and relaxing or releasing is uh… is what you want to say when you have them start to umm… let go of those muscles. So and then I'll ask before we get started if they have any questions, and that's a reminder that if you at home have any questions, you can write those questions in, and then I can answer that uh… Videographer will hand those to me, uh… if you have any, any questions about the progressive relaxation. And then uh… closing your eyes, I'm going to give you an example of how I might do patter umm… and tense those muscles now, feel the tension, noticing where the tension is located, focusing on how it feels, hold it releasing, feeling the tension draining into the couch as blood flows into those muscles, loosening those muscles, visualizing those muscles, unwinding, loosening, smoothing out, making no effort to relax. Just noticing the difference between how those muscles feel now as compared to before, looser, softer, more deeply relaxed. So that's an example of, of how one cycle would be, and then we want to ask clients to tense for about five to seven seconds. What I do is just time it, so that it's three statements in a Hold it, umm… feel the tension, notice where the tension is coming from, focus and focusing on how it feels, hold it, relaxing, and that's about seven seconds. Rather than sitting there with a stopwatch or a second hand. Same thing with a 30 to 40 seconds, umm… I do recommend that you watch a clock at first to, to, to notice about how long it takes for 30 to 40 seconds the first time, and then letting it relax a little bit longer the second time. So after they tense the muscles for the second time, signaling if those muscles are completely relaxed, and umm… if they signal then, you know, that those muscles are relaxed and you can move on. If they don't signal, and you want to explain that this to them, you know, that they've either fallen asleep or that they, umm… did not get those muscles relaxed. I've had a few clients say that they felt anxious, because they were afraid that they would fall asleep, because they started to nod off, so I let people now know ahead of time that, you know, you might begin to drift off, if you do let yourself drift off, I will wake you by talking a little bit louder each time, and saying, and in this is probably more information that they need, but just say umm… a little bit louder "Signal, if you can hear me. Signal, if you can hear me. Signal, if you can hear me." And then, umm… they'll, they'll raise their finger and you can, you can tell if they're asleep if you ask them to tense the muscles in a different way, uh… or again in the same way, and you see that they're not tensing the muscles and you know, that they've drifted off. Umm… and like I said this is rare, uh… but kind of a funny story, I had a guy who, who said, "This isn't going to work." and so well, you know, that might become a self-fulfilling prophecy if you're sure that it's not going to work, maybe it won't work. "Umm… would you want to just be willing to give this a shot?" and he said, "Well, okay." He was snoring loudly. Okay. So umm… and then, umm… so would the signaling, signaling on the very first group, signaling if those muscles are completely relaxed. And then with each additional group, signaling if the muscles, uh… the previous muscles. So signal if the muscles in your upper arm are as relaxed as your forearm or signal if the muscles in your forehead are as relaxed as your arms, umm… but with the arms and legs, we want to do the, umm… the equivalent of the opposite arm. So for instance, signaling if the muscles in your left forearm are as relaxed as your right forearm. Hopefully that makes sense. And then, umm… this last one uh… there should be a number four, it didn't get on your slide, so you want to write this part down. When moving on to the next muscle group, say, continuing to allow those muscles to relax. As you gently shift your tension to whatever the next muscle group is, I'm going to say that again continuing to allow those muscles to relax, as you gently shift your tension to for instance, your forehead. Hypnotic suggestion, Bernstein and Borkovec umm… recommend that we avoid hypnotic suggestion. and umm… and the reason that they do is that they say that if their experience is different, it might be disturbing. And also if they feel they might feel like their releasing control, and that they're giving up control in that you're having too much control. So umm… I don't work a lot with trauma survivors, so I don't have this, uh… too frequently, and I find that the hypnotic suggestion actually adds to it. And I believe that people do better. And, and working with Borkovec, he certainly included some patter that was suggestive. So use your best judgment on whether you want to use, umm… suggestion with that, uh… because some clients may find it more, more useful, and some might be frightened by giving up control. So you may have noticed that I have… I'm using process words or ING words if you will and that. Uh… oh, I'm sorry, I'm, I'm getting ahead of myself here with using the patter, and this is, this is true of not just progressive relaxation, but when you're doing any kind of relaxation, we want to move toward the relaxation rather than resisting anxiety. So in the past, when you were walking a client through relaxation you may have said something like this, "Let go of your thoughts. Put the thoughts out of your mind. Clear your mind." And instead, we want to say something like "Gently shifting your tension to the surfaces beneath you, noticing the difference between how those muscles feel now as compared to before, feeling those muscles loosening, unwinding," and then the process versus command. So, umm… in the past you may have said something like "Let go. Shift your tension to the sounds you hear, notice the surfaces beneath you, relax." Anyone ever tell you to relax and you want to flip them off. It's because it's a command, they're telling you what to do. So even as a therapist the that they trust, uh… it still has that, that feeling, and when they're telling themselves to relax, they can have that feeling that they're giving themselves a command. So encouraging them to use these words, not just when they're practicing relaxation, but throughout the day when they feel like they're beginning to get stressed out, umm… instead of saying "Relax" say "Relaxing." Umm… so letting go by gently shifting your attention to the sounds you hear, noticing the surfaces beneath you relaxing. Now not everybody know this is a difference between relax and relaxing, but I'd like for you to test it out at home, and repeat out loud after me. Relax, relaxing, chill out, chill in, calm down, calm in, calm, peace. So even states of being like calm and peace are fine as well, but we want to avoid using commands in our patter for progressive relaxation as well as with other, umm… with other forms of relaxation, so got a meme here, telling an angry woman to calm down works about as well as baptizing a cat. So we want to use process words and move toward relaxation. So in that relaxation patter, the language that we use when we're, we're walking clients through the relaxation portion, uh… is making no effort, noticing the difference between how those muscles feel now as compared to before, visualizing the muscles, unwinding, smoothing out, releasing. I typically use the visualizing if I know I have an art scene our right brain visual spatial, uh… person, and if I have someone who is decidedly more left brained, umm… then I may not use that as much. Uh… feeling the muscles, smoothing out, softening, unwinding, and releasing, draining, loosening, uh… doing the opposite of tensing or doing the opposite of what you had been doing. Now Borkovec, uh… doesn't write this in the book, Bernstein and Borkovec, but in my training with him, he was opposed to using the word tense or tensing while doing the relaxation portion. What I have done is I've adapted that, I will use the word tense during the first time through, but through the second time through, I'm focusing more on the relaxation. So I might say "feeling the tension, draining out into the surfaces beneath you or doing the opposite of tensing," whereas the second time through, I would avoid using the words, uh… the tensing words and say something more like, "feeling those muscles draining, doing the opposite of what you had been doing," or just avoiding those phrases altogether. Umm… the second time, feeling or visualizing the tension draining into the surfaces, and notice… and nothing to do, nothing to do except noticing the difference, nothing to do except enjoying how the relaxation feels, observing how the relaxation feels, nothing to do except getting acquainted with how the relaxation feels or even memorizing how the relaxation feels. Noticing that just by focusing on these muscles they feel more relaxed, softer, smoother, etcetera. Uh… that noticing that just by focusing on those muscles again that takes the umm… the pressure off that they're not trying, uh… letting go of crying, cotton ball imagery. I use that with the eyes, the eyeballs, and the jaw. And then if clients like that then I'll go ahead and have them visualize later, have the visualize their vertebrae, and the neck, and their back, and even their joints as being like cotton balls if I find after the first time that they really like that imagery. Commands are actually good during the tension cycle, because we want them to feel tension in that muscle group, and we want the contrast. So umm… tense those muscles now, feel the tension, and focus on where the tension is located, that's all fine. And we want to tense and release with the client that is in Bernstein and Borkovec's book. And I think that it's a really good idea, because it helps us to sound more tense when we're doing it during the tension cycle, and that helps us to sound softer and gentler during the relaxation cycle. And then we want to purposefully get slower and slower with the relaxation portion over time, and doing it along with them will help you to sound more, because you'll start to, uh… get more and more relaxed. Caution though, sometimes I get so relaxed that I'll forget whether I've done it first or second time, and if that does happen what I'll do is just say, umm… if we've only tense those muscle groups once, tensed those muscles now. So that's a way around it if you do forget, another way around that is by purposefully varying the first time with the second time, and doing something different the second time. In fact, with the upper torso, umm… we want to use breathing, the second time, so the second time after uh… you say releasing, umm… and I go ahead and include breathing out, exhaling. And then with the second time through, noticing that each time you breathe out, those muscles feel a little bit more relaxed or noticing with each exhalation, you're feeling a difference. And doing that the second time, not just with the upper torso, but with all of the remaining groups, and the fact that you are varying that, and only doing the breathing out the second time can help to, to, uh… allow you to remember. Now some of you younger folks may not have difficulties, but being over 50, blonde, and having ADHD sometimes I forget. Uh… so some of you are suffering from some of the same, same things. So allowing the relaxation to double on your next exhalation, again that's, uh… that is certainly a hypnotic suggestion and they want to avoid that with some clients. Umm… including what I do is, umm… include heavy and warm with clients who suffer from migraines. Uh… autogenic training, you may or may not be aware of is visualizing the hand warm and warming, visualizing heating elements in the hand, and noticing that the hand is becoming heavier, uh… the heavier it becomes the warmer it becomes, and this can be very effective combined with thermal biofeedback for migraines. But if the client, umm… if migraines aren't in the forefront of their issues, but they have the migraines I'll include the heavy and warm. If they're really sensitive, uh… remember that sometimes relaxation can actually trigger a migraine, so sometimes with some clients I'll only do the heavy and warm with the hands and arms, and avoid doing it the rest of the body until I know they can tolerate it, kind of tricky. We also want to learn alternative tensing strategies, so… when… remember that we're using the signaling having them raise their finger if the muscles are completely relaxed, they don't raise their finger, then we either want to do tense those muscle groups a third time or we want to do something different. So for the forearms, some of the things that you can do is instead of making a fist, stretch out your fingers and at the same time bend at the wrist, either way in either direction. I'll let the client choose which direction, so I'll say, "Uh… soon I'm going to ask you to tense those muscles again, but this time I'm going to ask that you spread your fingers wide and bend your wrist either backwards or forwards whichever feels best for you, tense those muscles now." and then they'll go ahead and try that. Umm… Isometric is all also always okay, with every muscle group. Just tensing the muscles with… without actually, umm… doing anything other than just making those muscles tight. And then the upper arm, we typically press down but we can press into the side as well, umm… and we can… what I'll do is say tense them up… tense them instead by pressing into the side then I might have them combine the two if they're still not relaxed to both, umm… and to the side and back. And then for the forehead if those muscles… by the way the little JA's behind it means that, that's what I've come up with anything else that you see that doesn't have a little JA behind it is Bernstein and Borkovec. So furrowing the brow as if confused is a great alternative tensing strategy to use in the forehead, and some people, umm… can't raise their eyebrows, they try and they can't do it. Umm… particularly if they've had Botox, they may not be able to do either of these if they have… if they, umm… are doing Botox. And umm… and then you may just want to skip, skip the forehead. And then the neck one thing to do that a lot of people like this better is to turn the head to one side, so what I'll say is something like this "Soon, I'm going to ask you to turn your head to one side as if you're looking over your shoulder, it doesn't matter which side just tense on one side now. Feel the tension, focusing on where the tension is located, noticing where you feel the tension, releasing. Coming back to the center and tense those muscles again now on the other side. Feel the tension, focusing on where the tension is located." Actually, umm… it's better to say, "And soon I'm going to have you move to the other side, tense those muscles now." Umm… and then, uh… and another one to do is to press… just press the head back. Umm… I don't particularly like this one, because I think it's really hard to not tense the rest of the body during that. And again a lot of people get physical therapy for their neck and I will have them use their, their PT strategies for their neck, and then the upper torso. Umm… Bernstein and Borkovec, talk about imagining that you have strings attached to the top of your shoulders and they're being pulled up towards your ears. Umm… and then umm… but we can also to the original one of pulling the muscles back we can do gently pull the muscles back and down, if they do this too quickly they can strain their back, so gently pulling the, the muscles back and down can actually, uh… tense those in a little bit different way, and cause it to be a little bit more tensed. Uh… another really good one is this, and I'll have clients do this afterwards if they weren't able to get those muscles relaxed is "Can you give yourself a hug," pulling the shoulders, umm… the arms across the front so that you're feeling it in the back. If they like this, I have them actually start with this, because otherwise, it upsets the relaxation of the arms, once you get to that part, alternatively, you can just have them bring their shoulders up. Umm… and again that can still upset the arms a little bit. So, the stomach is just, is just, umm… ordinarily… and I think I missed this… yeah, I know, I got it the first time, I'm sorry. Umm… is that we want to pull the stomach in, so I'll say so this… I call this one "Cute guy at the beach," you see a cute guy at the beach and you, you suck it in, umm… although, some women don't need to suck it. Umm… Another alternative I didn't put on there is, umm… is that we can, we can do in the same time, what I usually do start with pulling, but then if that doesn't work. It's okay. I want you to push the stomach out pull it in, push it out again and releasing. And then uh… the upper leg… I already did demonstrate to you the up and towards the self, you may want to use that as a first hand though. And then, umm… for the lower leg, we can just umm… we can just point the toes, again you want to have the leg down on the, the couch, but just uh… pointing the toe, pointing the foot, not the toes, pointing the foot, but leaving the foot as relaxed as possible, and that's gonna get the calf muscles. Umm… and that when I very, very, very, really have to do, usually people can get that relaxed. And then umm… if people are prone to cramps uh… I actually just started asking people umm… "How frequently do you get cramps in your calves?" and if they do then I'll say, "Let's tense a little bit lighter." And I'll do it for a shorter period of time the first time, and then the second time they don't get cramps then longer but if they do get cramps then you want to have them point their toes in the other direction to soften up that, umm… that, that cramp. Okay. And with the foot, umm… the best thing with the foot is to just, umm… again we don't want to upset the rest of the leg, so keeping the leg still, and just curling your toes back, and feeling the tension in the, in the on the top and in the bottom. I like that one, because a lot of people do get cramps in the foot, are pretty common from doing the point in curling under. At the end of the relaxation when you've ended with the non-dominant foot, noticing how the relaxation feels in your legs and feet, gently shifting your tension to your arms and legs, and noticing how the relaxation feels there. Continuing to allow those muscles to relax as you shift your tension to your face and neck, and noticing how the relaxation feels there and so on with the, the torso. And then I ask people, umm… to think about the words that they would use to describe again using that process thinking about what words you would use to describe "How the relaxation feels in your muscles?" And give them some time to do that now noticing how the relaxation feels, letting go of words and just noticing the raw sensations of relaxation, like a baby would, a baby who can feel their muscles, but they don't have words for their experiences, just feeling the raw sensations of relaxation. And then umm… after that, soon, I will count backwards from four. On four, you can bend and stretch your arms, on three you can bend and stretch your legs, on two you can take a diaphragmatic breath, and on one opening your eyes. Four and then wait for them to bend and stretch their arms, when they're finished bending and stretching their arms, three, again wait until the finish bending and stretching their legs, and likewise when they finish the, umm… the breath, and then four. Uh… sometimes they forget, so if they uh… forget then you want to go ahead and prompt them, so you might say four, because it make it so relax sometimes that, that they're really not paying a whole lot of attention. And so just say four and if you don't see them moving their arms and say bending and stretching their arms, etcetera. So at the end, you want to take notes, uh… copious notes on what their experience was. "So how do you feel?" "How do your muscles feel?" What words would you use to describe how those muscles feel? Was there anything at all unpleasant about your experience? And occasionally, you'll see people, their muscles will jerk, and if they say that that was unpleasant, let them know that that's a really good sign, that the relaxation is working. It's the way, uh… it's their body going back to homeostasis what their body is used to, so if their muscles are completely tensed all the time, and then they begin to relax them. It's their muscles trying to go back to where they were, and umm… and that that's a sign that they really need this, and to reframe it for them that when they experience that at home, but that's a sign that the muscle relaxation is really working. Umm… so what words would you use to describe how your muscles feel? And then talk about the problems that they had, umm… so based on the need for alternative tensing strategies. Don't assume that just because they signaled at one point that, they actually got those muscles relaxed. Umm… I'll also say too that, if they notice that the muscles are not relaxing further, more deeply that signal can mean that they're ready to go. Because sometimes, people get such terrible tension that they have residual tension that is going to be impossible to let go off. So umm… and then I may suggest that they get a massage or sit in a hot tub or a sauna to help loosen those muscles. But eventually as people practice and they get better at noticing when they're tensing up, they will begin to use the relaxation and that residual tension will go away. Umm… so asking too which of the, umm… strategies work the best, so for instance, if the person, umm… had… they couldn't get their forehead relaxed and they used the furrowing of the brow. Do you think that furrowing the brow was better? Or do you think you're going to need a combination? And that's useful because that will guide you when you do the shorter version with them, it's also gonna be useful for you to ask them at home to do both. Umm… and sometimes people say "Oh, the neck in particular." A lot of people will say, "Oh, the side to side was much better." So just do, uh… only the side to side. Then, umm… almost everyone who does progressive relaxation experiences a difference in the perception of weight. And umm… some people feel heavy or like they're sinking into the surfaces, some people feel light, some people feel a combination. If they don't mention that, I'll ask them. In fact umm… I actually ask them by signaling umm… before the debriefing and I'll, I'll talk a little bit about that when we get there. Umm… so what did I say was, was there anything that I said that you didn't like? Uh… that actually should have come under two was there anything that I said that you didn't like… and umm… was there anything that I said, what did I say that you found particularly conducive to doing relaxation What was particularly helpful and be prepared to go through the list of things that you, that you like to say. And you don't have… by the way you don't have to use all of those suggestions that I, that I used, you can used some that you like. Umm… it's not necessary to use all of them. So encourage people to apply what they experienced, the first time in their home practice and umm… ask the client, "Do you remember the muscle groups?" I have a one page document that I just ask "If you forget it e-mail me, I'll send it to you." Umm… I, I used to have it printed out, it's very easy to just print that out, and then, and then hand it to them if they think that they don't remember, they won't remember. Practice twice daily if possible, umm… or at least once. Borkovec is adamant that you must do it twice a day. Personally, I believe that people are going to be maybe less likely to throw in the towel completely, because most people aren't going to have time to do this twice a day. So say if there's any way you can do this twice a day, definitely do it if you, umm… if not really try to get it in once a day, and if you skip a day, try to make up for it. Try to get into on the weekends, and if, umm… for people who have trouble with insomnia, we don't want to use it as an aspirin, we don't want them to think of it as a way to try to fall asleep, but if they can't sleep, then it's an opportunity to get in an additional practice at, uh… relaxing. And uh… progressive relaxation works more like an antidepressant, where we want to use it, umm… on a regular basis rather than thinking "Oh, I'm relaxed today. I don't need to do the relaxation." We want to do it every day even if the person is having a good day. So it's not an aspirin or sleeping pill more like an antidepressant. If completely relaxed after the first time, you don't have to do, umm… the second time. You only, umm… you may not need to tense it twice. I've already talked about the muscle jerks, that it's a good sign, reframe that as successful and remember that this is a skill, and remember that you're going to umm… that it's an investment in your time. And that will be able to take short cuts later. Differential relaxation, umm… this is what I do the second week. Uh… I review any problems. See, if they were able to get ever think completely relaxed and umm… if they weren't then we may use alternative tense in strategies that we didn't use the first time. Umm… I also sometimes will recommend self massage, you know, just, you know, or get a spouse to trade umm… neck rubs or back rubs. And then umm… differential relaxation, differential relaxation is helping the person to lower their adaptation level. We talked earlier in the seminar, uh… the webinar that uh… the goal of progressive relaxation is for people to lower their adaptation level, the amount of tension they use throughout the day. So this umm… makes it more explicit. And uh… so what I will do and I want you to do this along with me today, is just where you're sitting now uh… letting go of any tension that you don't need using the least amount of tension. And now stand, and standing, I'll ask clients umm… "Where do you need absolutely no tension at all in your body?" And the answer is not in your hands and arms, none in your shoulders, none in your face. You need a little bit on your neck or your neck will fall, and that will actually be more uncomfortable than having a little bit of tension in your neck to hold up your neck. You need a little bit in your spine likewise, you know, if you don't have any in your spine, you'll just collapse and that will be more uncomfortable. Where we need the most tension is going to be in our legs, so I'd like for you umm… to think of loosening, letting go of any tension in your legs that you don't need, least amount of tension. If you found that your swaying, you've been successful. If you're not swaying letting go of even more tension, and if the client still isn't moving, asking them to purposefully, purposefully letting go of any tension in their legs. And the least amount of tension in your feet without falling down. And then umm… I will walk with the client in the hallway, of course, I'll talk about privacy issues I kind of tease them "Okay. Are you okay, being seen with me in the hallway?" and then will walk normal, and umm… noticing that while you're walking, you still, you can just let your arm swing, and you still need no tension in your face, no tension in your shoulders, no tension in your arms. And then I stop at the end of the hallway, and I say, "Okay. In a moment we're going to walk fast, like you're in a hurry. Uh… I don't want you to run, but I want you to just walk like you're really in a hurry, and maybe it would be inappropriate to run." Now we'll get to notice that you can do this with minimal, minimal additional tension in your legs. Umm… If you have a moment to try that out right now in your office, umm… do the camera, I won't get up in demonstrate, but walking, umm… at a normal pace. And I also emphasize with clients walking at your normal pace, avoiding slowing your pace. Because a lot of clients are threatened by slowing, and that may cause them to have some resistance to the relaxation if that or if they feel like this is going to slow them down. So umm… and sometimes what I'll do is demonstrate the difference between differential relaxation fast walk, and a… how people often walk when they're in a hurry, which is furrowed brow, fists… making fists, moving their upper body a lot and umm… to think of that as a metaphor for the day. Imagine if the entire day, you know, you have a really, umm… demanding day in the entire day, you're going through it with all of this extra energy, and all of this extra tension, imagining how much difference that's going to make at the end of the day versus walking fast and just having a little extra tension in your legs. Umm… and then umm… I've had clients bring in their laptops, use their devices with the least amount of tension, and talk about even during sports, umm… using only the, the tension that they need, umm… in fact, there was one of the Olympics in the '80s. I remember listening to these tapes even before… I know it to become a psychologist, I was listening to these tapes and it was having people imagine, engaging in their sports activity, umm… without tension, and that only using the amount of tension that they need in the places that they need it. So umm…. it can be very valuable actually in improving, uh… those performances as well as extending energy. Week three, umm… we want to teach, umm… seven muscle groups, and again you're going to show those muscle groups, umm… and that involves combining the groups. So, we want to combine both the, umm… upper arm and the, the lower arm so you're making a fist and pressing the elbow into the couch at the same time. And then umm… we're going to do all of the muscle groups in the face, and it's impossible to raise the eyebrows, and to stretch out the eyes, and nose, and cheeks, so we wanna add that brow furrow in there. Umm… with some clients, in fact I do this myself is I do in tandem, so I'll do raise the eyebrows for a few seconds and then do the rest of the face and then relaxing. Umm… and then, umm… and of course, I miss the non-dominant, but the next standalone, the neck is the same in the seven muscle group as it is in the 16 muscle group. And then the next group, we, umm… we combine the muscle groups, so it's taking that deep breath high into the lungs, pulling the shoulders back, and tightening the tummy, again leaving the arms be relaxed and, umm… and then the leg… so leg and the foot, so we're going to, umm… we're going to lift the leg, pull the, the foot in, and in the one… this is another reason why I like the toes back. It's a little less awkward, umm… but some clients really like the, the toes under, and don't get cramps… so it's just pulling the foot, and again the pigeon toe, and umm… curling those toes under at the same time, doing the entire leg, uh… lifting leg pulling it toward oneself or up and down to toe inward, umm… or foot, inward foot back, and toes curled in either direction. And then of course the non dominant leg, and then incorporate when you're taking the client through this, and having them do the seven muscle groups, incorporate all of that information that you learned from the 16 muscle group. Avoid the things that they didn't like, the words that they didn't like and umm… and if the client gave you, uh… a good deal of information about what they liked, just stick to only that. If they only gave you a little bit make sure that that isn't with each relaxation cycle, but that it's also, umm… but that you can also put in other things that you like, and umm… one thing that I try to put in regardless is noticing the difference, because that's paramount and helping them with the differential relaxation, and lowering their adaptation level. So I always put in notice in the difference even if they didn't uh… like that, uh… particularly. Not necessarily with every muscle group, umm… unless that's what they like, that I would be every muscle group. So umm… and then again remembering the alternative tensing strategies, the use of the preferred words, words and phrases, and umm… and the words that they used to describe, and then also that heavy or light or both. And then week five is four muscle groups, so we put both of the arms to gather, umm… face and neck goes together. Torso stays the same as it did with the seven muscle groups. And then we want to do both legs at the same time. Umm… so it's like, like that, okay. And then uh… week six is "recall using the four muscle groups." So recall is doing no tensing and just noticing where they feel the tension and holding on to that tension. Umm… and I'm gonna walk you through that and uh… with the arms. So umm… feeling the tension in your hands and arms, noticing where the tension is located, even increasing that tension without actually tightening those muscles and releasing, and try to time it with their exhalation. And then educate, umm… them to use their exhalation when they're going to the relaxation. Recalling how those muscles feel when they're most deeply relaxed. Remembering how those muscles feel after you've done deep muscle relaxation, and then incorporating those words that they used, released, soft, like jello, umm… allowing the muscle groups to feel that way now. So umm… Bernstein of Borkovec certainly have a great deal of respect to the utmost respect for Tom Borkovec, umm… and their procedure. Uh… I have without question seen more clients and taught more clients progressive relaxation because, Tom dedicated most of his career to research and, and teaching, umm… teaching therapy, and he's outstanding at teaching therapy, but he didn't… he saw very, very few clients. So I believe that after seeing clients, uh… rather than doing research that uh… some of the ways that I do it may be better, maybe not. So I'm presenting to you both ways, Bernstein and Borkovec go for three weeks with the 16 muscle groups, and have people practice it for three weeks even though the research shows that it takes two weeks before, it becomes maximally effective, and that in the third week it doesn't appear to typically do much more than a second week. Umm… and then they do this seven muscle group, four weeks, four through five, and then they do the four muscle group, uh… for weeks six through seven and then one week of umm… of recall, and then they do recall and counting. And I don't actually do this, I think it's a great idea, but umm… I do something a little bit different. Umm… as you remain very relaxed, I'm going to begin to count from one to ten, and as I count, I'd like for you to allow the muscles in your body to become even more deeply relaxed on each count. One, two, noticing your arms and legs becoming more deeply relaxed, and they coordinate with the exhalations, so one would be on an exhalation, two on an exhalation, each number would be on an exhalation, and then three, four, noticing that your face is more deeply relaxed, etcetera. So the way that I do things is, umm… I use, uh… the 16 muscle groups for weeks one through two. What I do instead of counting is if I have time and I always try to make the time for this, is when after the client has become completely relaxed, I'd asked them to think about what words they would use to describe how they feel, I'll say, most people notice a difference in the perception of weight, particularly in their arms and legs, some people feel as if their arms and legs are really heavy or that they're sinking into the surfaces or both, other people feel light and floaty. Still others feel a combination of light and heavy or floaty and heavy, "Signal if you feel a combination, and then signal if you feel…" until they signal, and then I use that information. If they feel floaty or heavy and floaty, I ask them to visualize that they are on a sturdy, comfortable, raft… dry raft on a body of water, and allow them to choose that body of water. It could be a shallow swimming pool, it could be a lake, it could be a pond, it could be somewhere that you've been before or something that you're making up in your imagination. And as you're lying on this umm… on the raft you're looking up into the sky, and the sky is mostly blue, but there are a few white clouds moving along in the breeze. You see a cloud shaped kind of like the number nine, and as you watch that cloud floating across your field of vision feeling the raft becoming even more floaty, and your body feeling more floaty. As you see the number eight, feeling your body sinking more deeply into the raft. As you watch the number seven, and notice… noticing the sense of peace and tranquility, allowing the peace and tranquility to double as you watch the six. As you watch the five, just enjoying the relaxation, getting acquainted with the relaxation as you watch the four, and so on. Now if the person doesn't feel floaty, I just have them lie on a lawn chair or on the, on the sand and or on a towel, on the grass or the sand, and then have them imagine that they're sinking into that surface. And then, umm… so I do that actually the very first week and then I teach differential the second week, I think why not get them being more of more and more aware of throughout the day when their muscles are feeling tense. Seven muscle group I may do, umm… I may have them practice that two weeks, umm… and then the fourth, before muscle group five or six, umm… and then muscle group recall. Sometimes, I teach muscle group recall, before I even teach the four muscle group, and when I teach recall, umm… then I'll, I'll say you could also combine the muscle groups and then have them do that. Remember two… Oh, my goodness. I lost connection here. Remember two that you don't have to stick to these numbers, umm… I usually almost always start with the 16 muscle groups, umm… but if the client is, umm… if the client is, umm… says that they're not willing to take 20 minutes that they're willing to take 10 minutes. Then I may go ahead and start with the seven muscle group or and then, sometimes, I may do eight muscle groups, so for instance, if they say they're still having a hard time with their shoulder, umm… or the upper back, then I'll, I'll continue to separate those rather than combining them on the second permutation, uh… similar with the Four muscle group. So we don't have to stick to those strict guidelines with that. And then to married man… Oh, and by the way, part of the reason I speed this up is I tend to do really quick therapy, and sometimes I only see someone for 5, 6, 7 weeks. So to extend it like Bernstein and Borkovec, umm… there were times that probably half of my clients, I wouldn't even see them for that number of weeks though that I believe it was 12 weeks. And then Tinman and Scarecrow, Tinman and Scarecrow is something that I will teach clients if I want to give them a head start, I want to get them using muscle relaxation, but uh… I don't want to take that full hour that it takes for me to teach them progressive relaxation. So umm… another time that I do progress… that I do the Tinman and Scarecrow is after I've gone through all of the progressive relaxation. And umm… and finally if someone says, "You know, I just don't have any time to do relaxation." "Do you have about a minute?" If they have a minute, I'll ask them to do Tinman scarecrow twice. What Tinman Scarecrow is, is just tightening all of the muscles, and I use the word, Tinman, because we don't want Superman, The Man of Steel, we don't want to tighten these muscles like steel as hard as we can. We want to think more of tightening them like tin, and then, umm… so the, the umm… so I'll say Tinman now, and then the, the, patter for the tension cycle is exactly the same but, then I'll say releasing into Scarecrow, feeling those muscles loosening, becoming floppy, no joints, like a scarecrow. So joint less, no joints, floppy, loose. Umm… so a few different thoughts, umm… you can do… teach differential relaxation any point even before teaching progressive relaxation, I will sometimes do this before progressive relaxation, but I then teach it again after I've taught progressive relaxation, if I do teach progressive relaxation. Another time you might do differential relaxation is that the client is absolutely unwilling to do, umm… to take any time, to get relaxed. Already talked about that, umm… again accommodating what the client is willing to do, you know, maybe you do four muscle groups, maybe do Tinman Scarecrow, maybe do seven muscle groups. Umm… self monitoring or asking the client to get into the habit of doing it at the same time each day can help with adherence. Another thing I like to do is to um, put up sticky notes if you've taken any of my seminars or you're familiar with Bernstein and Borkovec's, umm… uh… I'm sorry, umm… Borkovec and Costello's method of catching anxiety early nipping it in the bud, uh… they use sticky notes to remember to use relaxation throughout the day, and apply their skills throughout the day. The question mark is the Socratic approach, umm… and if the client is suffering from muscle tension then that question mark means, do I need all of this tension or it could be what's the least amount of tension I can use, and still drive my car safely What's the least amount of tension I can use and talk on the phone? If the client suffers more from fatigue than they do from muscle to tension, the question mark has more to do with energy. What's the least amount of energy I can use and still walk across campus, what's the least amount of tension I can use and type on my computer? Or do I need all of this energy. I present both to clients and let them choose. Umm… do we have any questions? No. Okay. So umm… sponge imagery, umm… goes something like this, and this can be taught I, I often will teach this before I teach progressive relaxation. In fact, I usually do in, uh… noticing the surfaces beneath you, feeling the floor beneath your shoes, and feet, feeling your legs, feeling the couch beneath your legs and seat, feeling the couch behind you, and the pillows behind you, and the couch beneath your hands. Visualizing imagining that all of these surfaces beneath you are like sponges. But instead of absorbing water, they're absorbing tension out of your body. Feeling the absorbing power of these spongy surfaces, draining the tension out of your body, allowing gravity to help, allowing your breathing to help, so that as you breathe in, you're feeling the tension breaking up, loosening, and as you breathe out, you're feeling the spongy sore surfaces beneath you, sucking the tension out of your body. With each exhalation, feeling a little bit more relaxed.
