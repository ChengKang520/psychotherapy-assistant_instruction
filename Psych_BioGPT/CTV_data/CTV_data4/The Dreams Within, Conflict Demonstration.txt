JOHN GOTTMAN Uh, let’s talk about conflict. 

00:01:05

00:01:05
JOHN GOTTMAN The fundamental thing that I want to say about conflict and we want to talk about this morning is that not all conflicts in relationships are the same. And there is kind of this pervasive attitude in all the other programs that really deal with conflict and, uh, in therapy, particularly skill-training programs that there’s a constructive way to deal with conflict and if couples would only learn how to be constructive during conflict, then their problems would be solved. And in fact, the, the problem is that people don’t listen very well, and they have to be active listeners, they have to really reflect back what they’re hearing their partner’s saying during conflict, so Bernard Gurney’s idea of active listening and the listener/speaker exercise was an important part of conflict resolution. Other therapists and researchers like Neil Jacobson have emphasized more negotiation of a final agreement as being important. And the, the focus really has been on resolving conflict and the idea is that if you help a couple resolve their major conflicts, that they’ll be fine. They’ll be alright. However, what we want to suggest to you is that most conflicts in a relationship never get resolved. And the research we’ve done where we follow couples for as long as twenty years shows that in fact there’s an enormous about of stability in couples’ interaction. And when you look at a couple four years later, they seem to be fighting about the same issues in the same way. Now the stability for individual behavior and you know, very much to the bane of personality theory is about point three. So you can account for about nine percent of the variants in human behavior by just knowing things about somebody’s personality. And, you know, when we first started doing this research, I remember my tenure and promotions committee at Indiana University said to me, ‘we don’t understand the individual personality, how can you ever hope to understand a couple’s relationship? If we can account for only nine percent of the variants in one person, then we’re going to be able to account for maybe two percent of the variants in two people. It’s just impossible.’ They were wrong. There’s enormous stability in, in the interaction in a stable couple and the stability is not point three, it’s point eight, point nine over a four year period. Now why is that? Why is there so much stability? And our laboratory’s not the only one to find that kind of stability. Mavis Hetherington has discovered it, too. Harold Rausch has discovered it, too in these longitudinal studies. And the reason is that if you take a look at what couples are fighting about, 69% of the time, they’re fighting about the same issues four years later. And four years later, the same issues, without intervention. And we realized after a while that these issues are perpetual problems and they’re endemic to all relationships. As soon as you pick somebody to have a committed relationship, you have automatically inherited your set of unresolvable issues that you’ll have for the next 50 years. And if you didn’t get together with that person, you’d get together with some other person- you’d have the same kind of issues or different issues. Some, some of them would be similar, cuz, you know, wherever you go, there you are, but some of them would be really different cuz you’re with another person. And in fact, Dan Wile,W-I-L-E, in his book “After the Honeymoon,” really pretty much said the same thing and one of the amazing things about Dan Wile is, uh, you know, we could do ten years of research, and, uh, come to a conclusion that Dan Wile is already concluded from his brilliant clinical experience and insight. And here’s what he said in, in a book called “After the Honeymoon.” He says if Paul marries Alice, and Alice gets loud at parties and Paul is shy and hates that. But if Paul had married Susan, he and Susan would have gotten into a fight before they even got to the party. That’s because Paul is always late, and Susan hates to be kept waiting. She would feel taken for granted, which she is very sensitive about. Paul would see her complaining as her attempt to dominate him, which he is very sensitive about. Now if Paul had married Gayle, they wouldn’t even gone to the party because she would still be upset about an argument they had the day before about Paul’s not helping with housework. To Gayle, when Paul doesn’t help, she feels abandoned, which she is sensitive about. And to Paul, Gayle’s complaining is an attempt at domination, which remember, he is sensitive about. Now the same is true for Alice. Paul married Alice, but if, if Alice had married Steve, she’d have the opposite problem because Steve gets drunk at parties and she gets so angry at his drinking, that, um, they would have a fight about that. If she’d married Lou, she and Lou would have enjoyed the party and had a nice time at the party, but the trouble would begin when they got home, because Lou would want sex, because he wants to feel close and he likes to have sex to feel close, but Alice only wants sex when she already feels close. So Dan Wile wrote “there is value in choosing a long-term partner in realizing that you will inevitably be choosing a particular set of unresolveable problems that you’ll be grappling with for the next ten, twenty, or fifty years. So that’s interesting. I mean, some problems really are unresolvable. They come from basic personality differences, or you know, basic need differences that these people have. And of course when you first get together and start living together, you don’t know that that’s not a resolvable problem, you think all that has to happen is she has to change. You know. And, uh, you know, part of the problem in relationships is that we tend to pick people who are not quite as perfect as we are, you know. They have these flaws. And uh, but then you find they don’t change. And you get more and more frustrated with that. Now, we found that there are two kinds of couples with respect to these perpetual issues and remember we’re saying that they are the majority of issues that people have in a relationship. And some people really are gridlocked on these issues and my visual image for gridlock is two fists that are in opposition, right. There’s no compromise. Each person’s position gets more and more polarized in this gridlock. Every time they talk about the issue, they hurt each other’s feelings, the four horsemen emerge, there’s criticism, defensiveness, contempt, stonewalling, very harsh start up, they’re not able to repair, uh, when they get into the conflict when it gets more negative. Or they eventually get to a place where they wanna, kind of, enclave this issue. They wanna sort of get it sort of wrapped in plastic and it becomes in the words of one of our great poets Robert Creeley, “a place where the rug bunches,” right. And so the rug bunches there and you kind of try to avoid walking on that section of the rug, but every now and then you forget and you trip over that part, that part of the rug. And the same way in a relationship this one issue can really, can really poison a relationship. Now why do people stay in this issue gridlocked, uncompromising position, while other people actually kind of adapt to the perpetual problem. It’s not that it goes away, but what happens is they really, uh, find a way of coping with it, of dialoguing with it. And really, I think that if you watch a lot of these tapes you’ll realize that you can actually think of the advice that relationships work to the extent that you’ve picked somebody whose perpetual issues you can tolerate. And they won’t work if you’ve picked somebody whose perpetual issues you just drives you up a tree, really makes you go ballistic, really sets off triggers that make you escalate the conflict or withdraw from the conflict because you feel so unappreciated and misunderstood and unaccepted. Well, what’s the difference between people who are coping with these perpetual problems and people who aren’t coping, who are in the state of gridlock? And how can you move people from gridlock to dialogue, alright? And you know, that becomes really one of the key questions about conflict. Now 31% of the time, these conflicts really were solved. So there are the minority of conflicts in relationships that really are resolvable. And in fact, you know, uh, we talk about that in our training, how to deal with resolvable problems. And the masters of relationships have, a very, very gentle approach to these solvable problems. But what about these gridlocked problems, you know, how do you take somebody from this kind of state to a state that is much more open, a state of dialogue. And what’s, what’s keeping them in, in the gridlock state? Now, it turns out it’s not, you can’t tell when the gridlock from the topic of the conversation at all. It can be about anything. It can be about getting a dog, it can be about housework, it can be about money, it can be about sex, or in-laws- it spans all the topics that couples argue about. So the content is not the giveaway. But the process is the giveaway. How they actually talk about the conflict really tells you a lot. And what you find when you look really deeply at the transcripts of how people are talking, and the videotapes of how they’re talking, the non-verbal behavior is that it appears that there’s a hidden agenda. Yes, they may be talking about money, alright, and they may be arguing about money and now they have to compromise about spending, and saving, and so on- but if you listen very carefully they are not just talking about money. They’re talking about what money means to each person. They’re talking about fundamental concepts like freedom, power, being loved, greed in the world, um, goodness and charity, um, they’re talking about the harm money can do and the good money can do. They’re talking about their legacy from their families- in other words, they’re talking about very core philosophical concepts that are existential in nature, that are very core to each person’s sense of self. So within these positions, what we say is within each person’s position, if you can really make the relationship safe enough, and open these fists, there’s a dream within each person’s position. About how they want the relationship to be with respect to this issue. And that dream is a very beautiful thing, usually. It’s about each person’s sense of who they are existentially. And until you talk about what the positions mean to people, right, symbolically, unless you become a narrative therapist and find out what the story is of why that position is important, you’ll never solve the conflict. You’ll never help them have a dialogue with the conflict, either, which is really the major goal we want to get to so they’re not hurting each other every time they talk about the issue, but they’re able to talk, they’re even able to laugh and be affectionate and understanding. So that’s the goal- getting them from gridlock to dialogue. And the way we do it is to use this Dreams Within Conflict intervention. So what, what we’re saying to people is not ‘the reason you can’t compromise on this issue around money is not because you’re a narcissist, or a borderline, you know, or you, you’ve been traumatized in your past, you know- that may be true, uh, but we’re saying the, no wonder you can’t compromise on this issue. You can no more compromise on this issue than you could respond to somebody who asked to borrow your bones. You can’t respond to that. And in the same way, you can’t give up in one of these conflicts the bones of who you are. And that’s what’s at stake for these people, right? So you can have one stage in which what, what the positions mean symbolically and what the narratives are, then you can begin to release the dreams and then the second part of Dreams Within Conflict is to find a way to honor both dreams and reach a temporary compromise. And the goal is dialogue with one another- not that you’ve solved the problem necessarily, but that you talk about it in a way that is temporarily constructive. They’ll always have the issue, probably. But it’s a perpetual issue which, with which they will be coping, rather than gridlocked. 

00:14:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Ok. First of all, let me just say, I am so happy to see all of you because what this tells me is that all of you have some commitment to trying to help couples stay together, love each other, love their children, stay together not just for the children for each other, and that devotion that you have to helping create relationships that work, uh, is exactly what we’re needing on every single level including globally. So with that said, I want to describe the intervention that we use, uh, that we have found to be the most powerful intervention in everything that we do in this therapy. Here’s what it is- it’s called the Dream Within Conflict intervention. And here’s how it begins, and we’re gonna demonstrate this in a minute. The way it begins, of course, is your couple comes into the room, they sit down let’s assume they’ve had a horrendous fight, they’ve had a terrible conflict, they’re in pain, they begin to describe to you the pain. They begin to talk with one another, probably angrily, they may throw criticism back and forth, they may throw contempt back and forth. Those we don’t want to see, we want to change that so we can feel within ourselves our own tension. This is a really good time to practice deep breathing, when you’re watching these couples fight, right? So. What we’re needing at a time like that is to help the couple have a better conversation. Now what that means within the context of our therapy is that we don’t want to make ourselves the center of the conversation. It’s triadic. And what do you do if you make yourself the center of the conversation? You prepare yourself to work with this couple for the next ten years, maybe fifteen years, maybe you go home with them, actually. You probably go on vacation with them. You take your cell phone all the time, and it’s on and they have your number, right? So. This is not gonna work. Our purpose is to help strengthen and empower the couple to be able to do this on their own. So what we do is we give the couple a different structure to have this conversation. And we tell them that of course it’s going to feel a bit artificial, because this isn’t what they normally do. Anything that is new and different will feel artificial. It’s being imposed on them. But we suggest they just try it as an experiment, just to see how it goes. We have a speaker, we have a listener. The therapist suggests one person be the speaker, one person be the listener, for let’s say in a real session, probably 20 minutes or so, for each person to be the speaker, then they trade roles, the other person is the speaker. The role of the speaker, you say, is to speak as openly as possible about why their position on the issue is so very important to them. Now you’re asking them to do something very, very difficult aren’t you? You’re asking them to take off the veils, to uncloak themselves, to show their deepest feelings, values, beliefs and so on. That’s terrifying, most times, especially if this is an old fight. What you say then to the listener is the key. To the listener, you suggest to the listener that they not, in this 15 minutes, present their position. That they not try to dissuade the speaker. That they not try to argue. That instead they ask questions. They simply ask questions to try to understand the speaker’s position as deeply as they can. What kind of questions? Well, here’s where the guidance comes in. The questions are questions like this- So why is this so important to you? What’s the most upsetting part about this for you? Is there some history behind this? Is there a story behind this for you? What makes this so important to you?’ And what you’re counseling the listener to do there is to be an existential, uh, researcher. To be an existential digger. To really work to understand what is at the core of their partner. So you draw in the person’s yearning for connection. Because what does conflict do? It divides us, does it not? But within that division, we seek connection that’s what we want more than anything. And what can feel more fulfilling than to connect with somebody without the feeling of threat, or danger. So what we are attempting to do is to help the couple connect. So the listener simply asks questions. The goal for the listener is to understand the partner’s position on the issue as deeply as they can. Now, you may certainly, uh, know with your own wisdom and your own experience that it’s going to be really hard for the listener to do that. The way that you can help support the listener to do that is counsel them that they too will get their turn as a speaker. The roles will be reversed and they’ll be reversed in this session and they will get their opportunity. And as long as people can at least hold themselves and their own position, for around maybe ten minutes for some folks, maybe 15 or 20 for others, knowing that they, too, will get their center, they’ll get their forum, they’ll get to speak their piece, and have the other inquire about them- it makes it a little bit easier. So that’s part one of the Dream Within Conflict intervention. Now typically this piece right there makes a huge difference because people typically are not used to be listened to. And typically the reason they’re not being listened to is because they’re being asked to listen to attack. Who wants to listen to attack? Nobody is going to say, ‘ I really understand that you are furious with me and that you think that I am a lazy slob and you want me to do better.’ You know, people aren’t going to do that. So we’re changing the nature of the dialogue. So that people can listen and learn about the soul of their partner, that’s really what this is about. They’re learning about the soul of their partner. And that learning because of, I believe, the human capacity to love, and to understand, and to have compassion, which I believe every human being has, no matter what their psychopathology. You’ll have people who connect with one another. They soften. They soften. Now remember this is a gridlocked perpetual problem. Perpetual means on and on and on, doesn’t it? So they’re not going to solve this. But what they can do in part two of the Dream Within Conflict intervention, and you’ll probably get to this in the second session, is that you ask them to compromise around the edges. And how do they do that? Here’s what you present them with. And we will not be role modeling this here but I want to describe it to you for future reference. You give them the image of two concentric circles- one circle in the center, a circle around that. The circle in the center is the one regarding this particular issue, what they cannot compromise on. What is absolutely core to them. In terms of their beliefs, their values, their experience, their morality. About this particular issue they define that first of all. And sometimes we’ll give them a page to write it on. Then in the outside circle, given that they will not be flexible on that, what can they be flexible on? Around the edges of the issue. So for example, if it’s an issue about parenting and discipline, and one parent wants to spank the child, the other parent hates spanking- the core of the issue for one person may be ‘thou shalt not hit a child, any child.’ The other person’s core may be, ‘I want my child to fit in to society and to learn good social skills to do that.’ Ok. Fine. So then around the edges- how will we set limits with our child? Honoring both dreams. Honoring both values. How will we do that? That’s where work takes place. But when they can acknowledge and identify the part of the dream that they will not bend on and put that out there it enables them to think creatively. Because they don’t feel like the core of themselves is being stolen away or defeated. That has to be respected within whatever compromise and they’ve defined it and they’ve expressed it to each other. Then around the sides- how will it be done? who will do it? in what circumstances will it be done? when will it be done? what will be done?- can be talked about in a more flexible way. So here’s what we’re going to do next. I’m going to roleplay, uh, with John being one partner, and Jane Pollock from the Gottman Institute being another partner, um. A couple. And the reason for this is that we realized at, um, about 11:30 last night that we’d forgotten the tape. And it was a little late to call you all and say ‘would you guys please volunteer?’ so generously, uh, we’re gonna wing it and see what happens which’ll be really fun. Let me tell you a little bit about this couple that they’re gonna be roleplaying. This is, this comes from a real case of mine in which the gentleman, um and in this case we’ll call him John. Um, uh, was a journalist and he wanted to go to Iraq, this, this took place probably, oh, gosh, must have been about eight years ago. He wanted to go Iraq during the time of the Iraqi sanctions to uh, report on what effects the sanctions were having on the people, on the children of Iraq. She, uh, was a young, uh, woman who had come from poverty, and that together they had a child who was one year old. And the child’s name was Jenny. So. With that, um, come on up and we’ll show you part one- remember, this is just part one of the Dream Within Conflict intervention. 

00:28:15

00:28:15
JULIE GOTTMAN  So. Are we on? Does that work? Everybody hear? 

00:28:30
[sil.] 

00:28:30
JULIE GOTTMAN Jane, you want to test your mic a little bit? 

00:28:40
JANE One, two, three. 

00:28:45
[sil.] 

00:28:45
JOHN GOTTMAN Ok, is that working? 

00:28:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Except it’s on the wrong side, honey. You might want to put it on the other. 

00:29:00
JOHN GOTTMAN Like that? 

00:29:00
JULIE GOTTMAN Eh, we’ll see. Let me help you with that, ok? 

00:29:10
JOHN GOTTMAN It’s, it’s turned around. 

00:29:10
JULIE GOTTMAN I know. Oh, great. Hold it, just hold it. Just don’t- 

00:29:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Ok. 

00:29:15
JULIE GOTTMAN I just disconnected the mic. We’re off to a great start. 

00:29:25
JOHN GOTTMAN It’s broken, honey. 

00:29:25
JULIE GOTTMAN I know. I think that if you just hold this it’ll work. 

00:29:25
JOHN GOTTMAN Ok, I’ll hold it. Ok. Can you hear me? Ok. 

00:29:35
[sil.] 

00:29:35
JULIE GOTTMAN So hi, you two. Jane, John. How are you? 

00:29:45
JOHN Great and terrible. 

00:29:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Great and terrible. 

00:29:50
JOHN I have just had the greatest opportunity of my career come up, and I, I have a chance to go to Iraq and tell a story of what’s, what the sanctions are doing to these children in Iraq. There’s close to a million children who are dying because there is no medicines, and I get to tell that story, I bring my camera and I can tell the world about this story and she won’t let me go. She doesn’t want me to go. 

00:30:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Ah. So you’re pretty frustrated. 

00:30:20
JOHN What? 

00:30:20
JULIE GOTTMAN You’re very frustrated. 

00:30:20
JOHN I am pissed off. 

00:30:20
JULIE GOTTMAN Angry. Jane? You’re looking like you’re very upset and holding a lot in. 

00:30:30
JANE Yeah, I mean, my gosh, he’s leaving. Do you know how dangerous it is in Iraq? 

00:30:40
JOHN I, I’m not a soldier, I am a journalist. 

00:30:45
JANE You don’t think that journalists get hurt? 

00:30:45
JOHN Some, some do. I don’t, it won’t happen to me. 

00:30:50
JANE Oh, yeah right. 

00:30:55
JOHN Well, I, you know, it could happen, but you know, (crosstalk) that’s, that’s a risk I’m gonna take. 

00:31:00
JANE (crosstalk)It’s gonna happen, I tell you, it’s gonna happen. I know it’s gonna happen. 

00:31:00
JOHN That’s, you know, I, I’ve been asked to go, and I’m, I’ve gotta go. 

00:31:05
JANE You don’t have to go! You don’t have to go! 

00:31:10
JOHN No, I’m gonna tell them at the paper, that my wife won’t let me go on the assignment, all right? That’s gonna do wonders for my career. The photojournalist who is reluctant because his wife said no. Maybe I’ll get a Pulitzer for that. 

00:31:30
[sil.] 

00:31:30
JULIE GOTTMAN So Jane, you look like you’re about ready to explode. 

00:31:40
JANE Oof. 

00:31:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Can you say something to John a little bit more about your feelings about this? 

00:31:45
JANE Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. 

00:31:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Go ahead. 

00:31:50
JANE I’m really, really angry. How could you leave me and Jenny? And go off to this place? Where you don’t even, you don’t even know what’s going on- you just hear it, or you see it on TV, but until you’re there, you have no idea. 

00:32:05
JOHN Life is a lot bigger than you and your child. 

00:32:10
JANE I would think that you would think that your life with your wife and child is the most important thing in the world. 

00:32:20
JOHN It’s important to leave the house. 

00:32:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Hmm. So let me stop you here for a moment. Right now, is this conversation going the way you want it to go? 

00:32:40
JOHN No. 

00:32:40
JULIE GOTTMAN No. How, how is it feeling for each one of you? John, in terms of this conversation, how is it feeling for you? 

00:32:45
JOHN I, it’s typical, you know? I mean, this is a typical conversation in this relationship, you know. I am being controlled. I am being told what to do. Uh, I’m being manipulated (crosstalk) by her feelings. 

00:33:00
JULIE GOTTMAN (crosstalk) Let me stop you, John. John? I want to stop you for just a moment. Because what you’re doing right now is describing Jane’s behavior. 

00:33:05
JOHN Right. 

00:33:10
JULIE GOTTMAN Can you try, to just describe what you’re experiencing. Yourself, inside. Not what she is doing, but what you’re feeling. 

00:33:15
JOHN I’m feeling determined. 

00:33:20
JULIE GOTTMAN You’re feeling determined? 

00:33:20
JOHN Yes. 

00:33:20
JULIE GOTTMAN Alright. 

00:33:25
JOHN And, and I’m feeling like I’ve got to, I can’t yield on this. I’m feeling that I have to, really. This is a moment that requires courage. 

00:33:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Ok. So this is about courage. Jane, what are you experiencing, right now? 

00:33:45
JANE Ohhh, I, ohhhh. Courage. Courage would be to stay home and watch this child grow, learn. 

00:33:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Jane? I want to stop you, also for just a moment. What are you experiencing inside right now? Just inside you. 

00:34:00
JANE Well, my stomach feels like it’s gonna be in my throat and then out, pretty soon. 

00:34:05
JULIE GOTTMAN Mmm. Ok. So your whole body is terribly upset. 

00:34:10
JANE Oh, gosh, yeah. 

00:34:10
JULIE GOTTMAN Can I make a recommendation here? 

00:34:10
JOHN Yeah, please. 

00:34:15
JANE Anything. 

00:34:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Because I can see that both of you are in tremendous pain around this, you know. 

00:34:20
JOHN Yeah. 

00:34:20
JULIE GOTTMAN This means a tremendous amount to you, John. 

00:34:20
JOHN It does. 

00:34:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Jane, it terrifies you. This is very, very scary for you. But it doesn’t seem like either one of you is really quite understanding the other person’s feelings as well as perhaps the depth of your own. You know that you feel it. But you, perhaps you’re not quite sure why it’s so important. You have a sense of why, John, you do, too. But I’m not sure the one person is understanding the other. Let me suggest the following- this is an intervention that is one that allows you just to understand the other person’s position, and to speak about your own without feeling threatened. Without feeling endangered. Without feeling attacked. And my sense is that when you guys launch into discussing this, that’s the outcome. You end up both feeling attacked and perhaps criticized. So. Here’s what I’d like you to try to do. One of you will be a speaker. One will be a listener. You’ll each have ten minutes for that role. What I’d like the speaker to do, and you’ll each get your turn to be a speaker, yes you will. Because that’s important. I can see that. You don’t want to be silenced. That’s right. And John? 

00:36:05
JOHN Yeah. 

00:36:05
JULIE GOTTMAN You’ll also get your opportunity to be a speaker. The speaker- what I want you to do is to speak about your position on the issue, with as much depth, with as much strength and passion as you feel about it. But it needs to be about what you want. Not what you don’t want. Listener- listener, when you’re listening, here’s what I want you to do and I’ll help you with this. I want you, and this is a difficult task, to hold your own position don’t speak it, just hold it inside, because you will get your chance. And simply ask questions to understand your partner’s position on the issue. And the types of questions that we find the most useful are questions like- why is this so important to you? what does this mean to you? is there some history behind this? what’s the story behind this that makes it so important to you? Ok? Ok. So I’ll help support each one of you as you speak to one another but that’s what you’ll be doing- one person will be the speaker, one person will be the listener. And you’ll have a dialogue with one another. And we’ll see if the dialogue goes a little bit better. Does that make sense? 

00:37:45
JOHN Yeah. 

00:37:45
JULIE GOTTMAN Ok. Alright. Who wants to start? 

00:37:50
JANE I think he should start. 

00:37:50
JULIE GOTTMAN You want him to start. 

00:37:50
JANE Yeah. 

00:37:50
JOHN I think I should start, too. 

00:37:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Ok. So, John. You’re going to be speaking about what you do want, to Jane. Jane, I’ll help you to ask questions only. Alright? Ok. 

00:38:05
JOHN I was, I was sickened by that war, that war, the Gulf War where journalists were kept with the troops, they weren’t free ro really report what happened there. We buried 65,000 Iraqi troops. We fried with, with napalm people fleeing from that war. And the Americans were viewing it as a football game and just rooting and waving their flags. Nothing was reported about those terrible losses the Iraqi people sustained. And we viewed it as a football game. And then we put the sanctions on and children are dying. Estimates are close to a million children are dying. And I wanted to reveal the injustice that is being perpetrated by our tremendous power. I wanted to tell the story of those families and those children. I have to do that. 

00:39:05
JULIE GOTTMAN Ok. So Jane? 

00:39:05
JANE Mmm-hmm. 

00:39:05
JULIE GOTTMAN You could ask a question like- what’s the most important part, for you about going? About you having to go? 

00:39:20
JANE How come you want to go? 

00:39:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Perfect. 

00:39:30
JOHN Because I was asked to go. When a journalist is asked to go, it’s an honor. And you don’t say no. You don’t say, I, I’m sorry I can’t go, my wife’s upset about it. 

00:39:45
JANE There must be some other reason. 

00:39:50
JOHN Well. 

00:39:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Try asking about why honor is so important. 

00:39:55
JANE Ok. How come, what’s this about honor? I, I don’t understand that. 

00:40:00
JOHN It’s about being a man. I mean it’s different for a man. A man has got to leave the house. A man has got to go out into the world. And a man has got to stand up for the things that he believes. And, and act with courage. It’s about courage. 

00:40:25
JANE Hmm. Courage. 

00:40:30
JOHN It’s not about danger. It’s about courage. 

00:40:30
JANE Was your father a courageous guy? 

00:40:35
JOHN My father was an asshole. I mean, he’d be in jail now by today’s standards. He was a violent, horrible bastard. My mother stood by and just let it all happen and I was too small to do anything. And when I got big, I, I was, I wasn’t as mean as he was. I mean, to him, that was not being a man. But I realized, you know, that I couldn’t be a man the way he was a man. I couldn’t be mean and tough the way he thought I should be but I could reveal to the world assholes like him. And when the, and the damage they caused. And that’s why I became a journalist. 

00:41:20
JANE Hmm. 

00:41:25
JULIE GOTTMAN So. His pain about what his father did has something to do with Iraq, doesn’t it. 

00:41:40
JANE Well, you know, I’m in pain, too. I’ve got a whole lot of pain. 

00:41:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Yes. 

00:41:45
JANE He never even asked me about my pain. 

00:41:45
JULIE GOTTMAN And do you know what, Jane? He will ask you about your pain very soon. I think there’s a little bit more to understand, and then your turn will come where you can really talk about your feelings, your situation, your experience here. Ok? 

00:42:00
JANE What do I have to ask him? I, I don’t know. 

00:42:05
JULIE GOTTMAN Do you completely feel like you understand why it’s so important for him to do this particular mission? 

00:42:15
JANE A little bit, yeah. 

00:42:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Ok. 

00:42:15
JANE Yeah. 

00:42:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Alright. Try asking him what it is about, maybe about witnessing Iraq? Because that’s what he’s doing, he wants to go and tell the story. Why is telling the story about Iraq such a big deal? 

00:42:40
JANE Ok. So John, how, how, why is it so important that you’re there? Why can’t you just, what is it about that? That you want to be there. 

00:42:55
JOHN Well, like Willy Sutton said when they asked him why he robbed banks, he said- that’s where the money is. You know? And that’s where the injustice is happening. I mean, that’s where I was asked to go. I have to go to where I was asked to go. I have to take on the mission that’s dangerous. And that’s why I have to be there. I have to be there because I take pictures. I tell,(crosstalk) I, I get the world to see what’s there. So I’ve got to go there. 

00:43:25
JANE (crosstalk) inaudible 

00:43:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Jane, he said something really important here about injustice. Why don’t you ask him something about injustice. 

00:43:40
JANE Why is injustice so important to you? 

00:43:50
JOHN Well, I, it’s important to me to, to try to defend those people who can’t defend themselves. To me, courage is about not, it’s not about not being afraid, it’s about being afraid and moving forward even though you’re afraid. Because you’re defending the people who are innocent the people who are weak. And can’t defend themselves. And, and also it’s about nobody else being there and my getting the story. I wanna beat out all the other journalists who are going to get there. I wanna be there first and get the story. So that’s important to me, too. 

00:44:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Mmm. Ok. So there are two parts of that, aren’t there? One part is, injustice is important. When the weak are suffering. 

00:44:55
JANE Mmm-hmm. 

00:44:55
JULIE GOTTMAN He wants to use his story-telling to reveal it, to witness it, perhaps to change it. To make a difference. Right? 

00:45:10
JANE Mmm-hmm. 

00:45:10
JULIE GOTTMAN Think about his father- very big. Himself as a child- very small. Right? 

00:45:20
JANE Mmm-hmm. 

00:45:20
JULIE GOTTMAN Can you see the connection? 

00:45:25
JANE Mmm-hmm. 

00:45:25
JULIE GOTTMAN And why justice, doing justice, when you’ve been unjustly beaten. 

00:45:35
JANE Mmm-hmm. 

00:45:35
JULIE GOTTMAN Is so terribly important for him. 

00:45:40
JOHN Yeah, that’s it. 

00:45:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Ok. Ok. Let’s trade roles now. 

00:45:45
JOHN Ok. 

00:45:45
JULIE GOTTMAN Do you feel ready to be a listener, John? 

00:45:45
JOHN Yeah, I, I think you got it. Yeah. 

00:45:45
JULIE GOTTMAN Ok. Alright. Jane, do you think you have a better understanding of him? 

00:45:50
JANE Mmm-hmm. 

00:45:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Ok. 

00:45:55
JANE Yeah, I do. 

00:45:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Alright. Ok. John, you’ll be doing the same thing now. You’ll be asking Jane questions just about trying to understand why her view is so important to her. Jane, try to speak from as deep a place as you can to really inform John about why your position is so important to you about this issue. Alright? 

00:46:20
JOHN I ask questions? 

00:46:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Yeah. Let Jane start, and then we’ll see what happens. And you just ask questions. 

00:46:30
JOHN Ok. 

00:46:30
JULIE GOTTMAN That’s right. Ok. Jane? 

00:46:35
JANE So. You know, if you walk out that door I don’t have any guarantee and, and Jenny doesn’t have any guarantee that you’re gonna come back. And I mean, how many times have I told you that my dad, I mean, my dad, he left us. I was like, what, ten years old and I had to, I had to take care of my brothers and my sisters, I was ten years old and I, I had to watch my mom go out to work trying, trying to support us. Uch. Do you know what that feels like, to be ten years old and think you have to be the adult in the family? 

00:47:45
JOHN Oh, she, she could have done a better job. 

00:47:45
JULIE GOTTMAN John. I want to stop you for just a moment. 

00:47:50
[sil.] 

00:47:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Because the effect of that question or comment, actually, may feel like a criticism of Jane’s mom. 

00:48:05
JANE Yeah. 

00:48:05
JULIE GOTTMAN We don’t want to go there. That isn’t where we want to go. Let me give you another suggestion. 

00:48:10
JOHN I guess it was a criticism of, of her. 

00:48:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Really? 

00:48:15
JOHN Yeah. 

00:48:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Good confession, good confession. Ok. Let’s try something different. Try asking Jane what the connection is for her between her dad and you. You’re not her dad, so, what it is about your going to Iraq that feels so difficult for her? Alright? 

00:48:40
JOHN Ok, so, what is it about my going to do this story that is like your father leaving, or feels so difficult for you? Why does that relate to? 

00:48:50
JANE Well, like I said, I mean, the minute you walk out the door, John, I don’t know if you’re gonna be shot the minute you get off the plane. I mean, my dad just, he just walked out the door, you know, he, he just walked out the door and he never came back! It’s, it’s like so unsafe. Jenny and I are just gonna be alone. 

00:49:20
JOHN So what would be so terrible about you and Jenny being alone? I mean you could remarry. 

00:49:30
JANE I don’t wanna remarry, I love you. You’re the one I love. I don’t wanna remarry, I just don’t, I don’t want to lose you. I’m so afraid I’m afraid of, I’m afraid of losing you. 

00:49:45
JULIE GOTTMAN John, let me pause for just a moment. Did you know that she loved you that much? And did you know that you were irreplaceable? That she doesn’t want another person, she wants you. Can you take that in? 

00:50:05
[sil.] 

00:50:05
JOHN I, I didn’t know that. 

00:50:20
JULIE GOTTMAN Ok. So you might want to ask her, oh, maybe what would be the worst thing about you not, I mean why does she think you’re not gonna come back? You think you’re gonna come back. Why does she think you wouldn’t come back? What would be the worst part about that? 

00:50:40
JOHN What would be the worst part of my, my not coming back? For you? 

00:50:50
JANE Our child. Our child wouldn’t, wouldn’t know who you are. Our child wouldn’t understand why it is that I loved you. You’re just, she’s too little. She’s only a year old. She wouldn’t know why all the things that I love about you, they, how would she know that? You’re gone. 

00:51:25
JULIE GOTTMAN John, try asking this question- 

00:51:30
[sil.] 

00:51:30
JULIE GOTTMAN Why does she think that the worst thing might happen? Because that is what she is thinking. 

00:51:45
JOHN Yeah. So, so, why do you need to control and manipulate me so. 

00:51:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Uh-uh. John. I’m going to stop you. For just a moment. Because the effect of that is really more about you and your experience rather than hers. 

00:52:10
JOHN Oh, yeah. 

00:52:10
JULIE GOTTMAN Alright? 

00:52:10
JOHN Yeah. Ok. 

00:52:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Alright. So let’s focus on her experience. 

00:52:20
JOHN So, so what was that question again you wanted me to ask her? 

00:52:20
JULIE GOTTMAN Alright. So the question is why does she think the worst thing is going to happen? 

00:52:30
JOHN Oh, ok. Got it. So why do you think the worst thing is gonna happen? 

00:52:40
JANE Cuz I have seen the worst thing that can happen. 

00:52:45
JOHN Which, which is what? 

00:52:45
JANE I saw my father leave. I saw, I saw what it was like not to know who he was. I lived it. I don’t want Jenny to live it. 

00:53:05
JOHN What’s the big deal about not knowing what your father was? 

00:53:10
JANE I think it’s the most important thing in the world to know who you are and what you’ve come from. In my eyes dads are just about the most important thing in the whole wide world. 

00:53:35
JULIE GOTTMAN Hmm. So I’m gonna stop you here. Obviously this isn’t a completed conversation. There’s much more to understand here. But I want to point out something that is very striking to me about what’s happened here and that is that Jane who lost a father, you’re saying a father is more important than anyone in the whole wide world. John, you had a father who committed abuse and injustice. 

00:54:05
JOHN Right. 

00:54:10
JULIE GOTTMAN So for you, a father is somebody you do not want in your life. 

00:54:15
JOHN Right. 

00:54:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Jane, for you, a father is somebody that you’ve always yearned for in your own life. 

00:54:20
JANE Mmm-hmm. 

00:54:20
JULIE GOTTMAN And you don’t want Jenny to lose. 

00:54:25
JANE Mmm-mmm. 

00:54:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Right, ok. Alright. So did this conversation feel a little bit better to you than the other one? 

00:54:30
JANE Uch. 

00:54:30
JULIE GOTTMAN A little bit. 

00:54:30
JANE Tons better. 

00:54:30
JULIE GOTTMAN Even a little bit. Ok. So given that we only have three days for you to make this decision, it might be wise for us to have another conversation about this, deepen the understanding a little bit more, and see what decision you want to make from your understanding of each other. Okey-dokey. So we’re stopping. Uh, quick questions. 

00:55:00
[sil.] 

00:55:05
JULIE GOTTMAN So the problem is, of course, that they made it all too easy. The tape was a little tougher. But in any event, any questions, um, before we stop for today? Ok. Yes. Oh. No? 

00:55:25
UNKNOWN I have a question. 

00:55:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Oh, is there a mic? 

00:55:35
UNKNOWN Thank you, that was wonderful to watch. I wanted to ask you, how come you don’t use paraphrasing in addition to question asking? 

00:55:45
JULIE GOTTMAN It’s too much to ask. In other words, most of our clients are not therapists. They’re not trained to be therapists and when they feel upset by the conversation, they’re struggling to understand something. Um. Paraphrasing begins to feel like an automatic exercise that, that distracts them from experiencing on an emotional, a physical, perhaps a spiritual level what their partner is saying The other piece, I think, the biggest reason that we don’t ask for that? Is that 30 years of research in what couples do who really make it work? They never paraphrase. Ever. No matter what they’ve learned in the therapy. They don’t paraphrase at home. So what we’re trying to do is to give them tools that are real. That they can take, transplant to home and use. 

00:56:50
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:56:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Mmm-hmm. Next, next question? Uh, over here? 

00:56:55
UNKNOWN You referred to the four horsemen in the first part of the talk. 

00:57:00
JULIE GOTTMAN Mmm-hmm. 

00:57:00
UNKNOWN Go, go through that a little bit, please. 

00:57:00
JULIE GOTTMAN Ok. The fifteen second version, here they are- four horsemen of the apocalypse, they predict divorce. They predict terrible conflict. Criticism- which is defining the problem in terms of a defect in your partner. Defensiveness- warding off the attack that the individual feels. Contempt- which is, criticizing the other from a moral high ground, a position of ‘you are disgusting to me, you are inferior to me, this is what’s wrong with you.’ Contempt. Stonewalling- where you shut off, one of you shuts down, shuts off, typically you’re feeling flooded, you don’t respond at all. 

00:57:50
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:57:50
UNKNOWN Ok? I have a follow-up to that. 

00:57:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Ok. 

00:57:55
UNKNOWN I was just curious about the four horsemen seem to be manifesting non-verbally in addition to verbally, which you were attending to. But I was wondering about your choice about not responding to the eye-rolling and the similar behaviors. 

00:58:10
JULIE GOTTMAN Ok. Um. Here’s why. Because we’re not trying to create perfection here. We human beings are not perfect. We’re trying to create good enough. And good enough doesn’t mean you catch every single criticism, every single contempt, because if you did, um, you might as well give up You know? People are doing it all the time. So you wanna remark about the most important ones and a few may kind of slide through but the question is, is the conversation they have a little bit better than what they were doing when they came into the session. If it is, terrific. You’re on the right vector. And remember, if you can make this much difference, what happens over time? Ok. John? No? Alright. 

00:59:10
UNKNOWN Another, another point? 

00:59:10
JULIE GOTTMAN Uh, I’m sorry, we are gonna need to stop. Thank you very much. 

00:59:15
