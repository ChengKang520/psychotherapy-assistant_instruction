Therapeutic Three Generation Family Reunion Carl Whitaker, MD 

00:01:05
CARL WHITAKER Progress more valuable, but this is a consultation, this is not a therapy. We're gonna, they're gonna videotape. 

00:01:20
[sil.] 

00:01:30
CARL WHITAKER You wanted me to help with your family, and uh, why don't you start by telling me, well, who they are, after you can bring them up if you would. And uh, then what's your experience's been and what you hope to get out of it and uh, what you dream I can do for to help 'em. 

00:01:45
DR. ELLIS Would you like for me to 

00:01:45
CARL WHITAKER Yeah. 

00:01:45
DR. ELLIS Bring them up first? 

00:01:50
CARL WHITAKER Yeah, would you bring them up first? Let me see if I can disconnect this thing. Oh, good. Here, I'll get it. 

00:02:00
[sil.] 

00:02:40
CARL WHITAKER Come in, come in. Isn't this a mess? Why don't you just take a chair, and we'll worry about that afterwards. 

00:03:00
[sil.] 

00:03:10
CARL WHITAKER How do you do? I'm so sorry, I didn't bring my knife. I had a good knife that I was gonna let you play with, and I forgot it. It's a shame. 

00:03:20
[sil.] 

00:03:25
DR. ELLIS I'd like to start by introducing the family to you. 

00:03:25
CARL WHITAKER Please. 

00:03:25
DR. ELLIS Rubelina, who is 9 years old. 

00:03:30
CARL WHITAKER Hi. 

00:03:35
DR. ELLIS Juanita, the grandmother. Juanita. Is that okay? Can you hear me there? Um, maternal grandmother. Ileana, mother. 

00:03:45
CARL WHITAKER Hi. 

00:03:45
ILEANA Hi. 

00:03:45
DR. ELLIS Ryan, who's 3 years old. 

00:03:50
RUBEN Say "Hi," Ryan. 

00:03:50
DR. ELLIS And Ruben. 

00:03:55
CARL WHITAKER Hi. 

00:03:55
RUBEN Hi. 

00:03:55
DR. ELLIS And um, this is the first time I have seen the entire family together. I have um, they've had three visits with me, and uh, were referred to me um, by a physician due to some physical ailments that Rubelina was experiencing. Um, she was having difficulty with um, heart palpitations and a lot of anxiety. She was afraid that she was gonna die. And they um, her, they all live together. There have been some recent changes in the family, economically. I think they have um, are in their own business and are now working out of the home. And I have seen in the visits, the first visit was with the parents and, and Ruben, and the second visit I, I met uh, Ryan and uh, the third visit I met once again with the en-, the entire family configuration. You know, we were planning to um, meet together with my meeting the grandmother and it just so happened that it worked out that we would do that today. 

00:05:15
CARL WHITAKER That's very courageous of them. 

00:05:20
DR. ELLIS Now, 

00:05:20
CARL WHITAKER Most families couldn't have guts enough to come up here. 

00:05:25
[sil.] 

00:05:30
DR. ELLIS Um, they are, just briefly some, some background. Um, Ileana and her mother are from the United States. Yes, Ileana is. And Juanita is from 

00:05:45
JUANITA Durango. 

00:05:45
DR. ELLIS Durango, Mexico. And Ruben is from Venezuela. Um, Rubelina was born in Venezuela and Ryan was born here. Um, they have been back in the United States for approximately eight years now. 

00:06:05
[sil.] 

00:06:10
DR. ELLIS Where um, Ruben and Ileana met awhile um, Ileana was living in uh, Venezuela. And came back after Rubelina was born. There is a um, Ileana is bilingual and the children are bi-, are bilingual. Uh, Ruben understands English, and uh, 

00:06:35
RUBEN A little bit. 

00:06:35
DR. ELLIS A little bit. And speaks a little bit of English, and uh, Juanita is uh, monolingual Spanish-speaking. And understands a little bit of English. Little bit. 

00:06:45
CARL WHITAKER Will you help us, if there're times when you don't understand, by letting us know so we can translate, or he can translate. I can't translate, I'm embarrassed to say. 

00:07:00
DR. ELLIS Actually, it's very appropriate because uh, the business that Ileana is in is translation. And uh, she is a translator and has her own business doing that. Um, recently I've been uh, in the family meetings, Rubelina has said she's been experiencing less uh, problems with the anxiety after a, a few visits and uh, they've been subsiding and we've been discussing more of the family interactions. They um, uh, own two houses and the um, family has had a need to live in the different houses. Ruben spends more of the time in one of the other houses due to business, and um, Ileana spends time with her mother and the children in the other house. And so the family has been a little uh, let's say, fragmented for the last few months. And uh, that is around the time that uh, Rubelina began to experience uh, some of her problems. And um, what we would hope to do is to uh, help the family um, work with each other in such a way, to relate to each other in such a way, that they would um, live more harmoniously with each other and, and be able to help each other. And my hope today is for um, us to talk to you and to see if you can provide us with some direction so that might be uh, more easily conducted. 

00:08:35
CARL WHITAKER Anything you guys would like to add? Grandma, do you have anything you think he should have said that he didn't say? 

00:08:45
[sil.] 

00:09:05
ILEANA Not at the present. 

00:09:05
CARL WHITAKER Anything you think we should add to what he said? 

00:09:10
ILEANA I think Dr. Ellis uh, covered it pretty much uh, the family situation at the present. 

00:09:20
CARL WHITAKER Could you ask grandma if she can tell me what she thinks the family has as stress in it, or where the family is upset with itself? 

00:09:35
[sil.] 

00:10:15
ILEANA That we don't understand each other. 

00:10:20
[sil.] 

00:10:25
ILEANA I think of something that maybe might not be right. What do think that's not right? 

00:10:40
[sil.] 

00:10:55
DR. ELLIS She, she's saying that she um, that people do not, in the family think that what she says is right, and sometimes she'll have to be telling them to put things in this place and that place. She's, she, she believes that that's part of the tension in the family, that things are not a certain order. 

00:11:15
CARL WHITAKER That they don't, they don't listen to her? 

00:11:20
DR. ELLIS They don't listen to her. 

00:11:20
CARL WHITAKER Is that because she's too old? 

00:11:25
[sil.] 

00:11:35
DR. ELLIS She said it, 

00:11:35
CARL WHITAKER Well, they don't listen to me, either. That's why I turned my back on 'em. 

00:11:40
[sil.] 

00:11:50
CARL WHITAKER If, if your husband was here, would they listen to him? 

00:11:55
[sil.] 

00:12:00
ILEANA Yes. 

00:12:00
CARL WHITAKER Is he dead? 

00:12:05
ILEANA Yes. 

00:12:05
CARL WHITAKER How long? 

00:12:10
ILEANA 20 years ago. 

00:12:10
CARL WHITAKER And you've been both father and mother since then? 

00:12:20
ILEANA Yes. 

00:12:20
CARL WHITAKER So why don't you give up? 

00:12:25
[sil.] 

00:12:30
ILEANA In what way? 

00:12:30
CARL WHITAKER Just give up making believe you're still mother? 

00:12:35
[sil.] 

00:12:40
CARL WHITAKER You could just go back to being a woman. How about that? 

00:12:45
[sil.] 

00:12:50
ILEANA No. 

00:12:50
CARL WHITAKER I have a crazy thought. I think mothers are, are make-believe. You can go back to being a real woman. 

00:13:00
[sil.] 

00:13:05
CARL WHITAKER What would you do if you really started being a woman instead of a mother? 

00:13:15
[sil.] 

00:13:20
ILEANA I really don't know. 

00:13:20
CARL WHITAKER Would you like to go back south? 

00:13:25
[sil.] 

00:13:30
ILEANA No. 

00:13:30
CARL WHITAKER And you wouldn't find another man? 

00:13:30
JUANITA No. 

00:13:35
[sil.] 

00:13:40
CARL WHITAKER Oh, man. Well, you can't blame her. You can't blame me for trying. You can't blame me for trying. 

00:13:50
[sil.] 

00:13:55
DR. ELLIS She's afraid of suffering the same thing. 

00:14:00
CARL WHITAKER Little louder? 

00:14:00
DR. ELLIS She's afraid of suffering the same thing all over again. 

00:14:05
CARL WHITAKER Oh, of course. I think you're all hopeless. The only thing that's worse than men are children. Haven't you given up hope for your children? 

00:14:20
[sil.] 

00:14:25
JUANITA No. 

00:14:25
CARL WHITAKER Why not? I thought maybe if you had, you could teach me how. 

00:14:35
[sil.] 

00:14:40
CARL WHITAKER You think you'll worry about them until you die? 

00:14:45
ILEANA Yes. 

00:14:45
CARL WHITAKER How long before you're gonna die? 

00:14:50
ILEANA I dunno. 

00:14:50
CARL WHITAKER Well how, how long do you wanna live? 

00:15:00
ILEANA Whatever God permits. 

00:15:00
CARL WHITAKER Oh. Aren't you gonna be to blame for it yourself? 

00:15:05
ILEANA No. 

00:15:10
CARL WHITAKER You think you'll last long? 

00:15:15
ILEANA I don't know. 

00:15:15
CARL WHITAKER How old was your mother when she died? 

00:15:20
ILEANA 87. 

00:15:25
CARL WHITAKER So how many, how old are you? 

00:15:30
ILEANA 69. 

00:15:30
CARL WHITAKER Pardon? 

00:15:30
ILEANA 69. 

00:15:35
CARL WHITAKER 69. Wow, you've got a long time to live yet. You can marry two more times before that. 

00:15:45
JUANITA No. No. 

00:15:50
ILEANA No, no more. 

00:15:50
CARL WHITAKER No more. 

00:15:50
DR. ELLIS Juanita shared with me some information about her family. She said her father had 53 children. 

00:16:00
CARL WHITAKER Wow. How many did you have? 

00:16:05
JUANITA One. 

00:16:05
CARL WHITAKER Just the one. So you're 53 children all in one. 

00:16:15
ILEANA That's right. 

00:16:15
CARL WHITAKER Wow. What a problem. 

00:16:20
[sil.] 

00:16:25
DR. ELLIS She has two cousins that also are uh, duplicating the pattern of her father, having a lot of children. But, but none of the women. 

00:16:35
CARL WHITAKER Oh. So, so you have to be 53 children and she has to be 53 mothers? 

00:16:45
ILEANA I don't know. 

00:16:45
CARL WHITAKER Wow. Does it feel like that to you? 

00:16:50
ILEANA Yes, it does. 

00:16:50
CARL WHITAKER Do you have any sense of how old you are to her? 

00:16:55
ILEANA Not really. 

00:17:00
CARL WHITAKER When I was 65, I went to visit my mother who was 92, and with my brother and sister. And what she wanted to say before she died was that I oughta send, set up a research institute and study contraception. 

00:17:25
[sil.] 

00:17:35
CARL WHITAKER So I was 65, and she thought I was 14. 

00:17:40
[sil.] 

00:17:45
CARL WHITAKER So what are your plans for you daughter when she grows up? 

00:17:50
[sil.] 

00:18:00
ILEANA The same thing she is now. 

00:18:00
CARL WHITAKER Well, I was wondering, I had the feeling that if you were such a good mother, all she can be is your little girl until you're dead. That's sounds like a long, hard job. 

00:18:15
[sil.] 

00:18:20
JUANITA Oh, no. 

00:18:20
CARL WHITAKER No? 

00:18:20
ILEANA Well, I don't want her to be my little girl. 

00:18:25
CARL WHITAKER Well if sh-, if you see her as your little girl and she feels like your little girl, what are we gonna do? 

00:18:35
[sil.] 

00:19:10
DR. ELLIS That her daughter can change and grow up, but the, the feelings of a mother are always the same. 

00:19:20
CARL WHITAKER What would happen if you became her daughter? 

00:19:25
[sil.] 

00:19:35
DR. ELLIS I'd have her close and never let her go too far. 

00:19:40
CARL WHITAKER But if you became, if you became her little girl, then maybe she could give you a chance to grow up and be a woman. 

00:19:50
[sil.] 

00:20:25
ILEANA I don't know what to answer. 

00:20:25
CARL WHITAKER You don't know what to answer? You oughta try it some time because it might be fun. You could get to be her little girl, then it might be fun. And you could stop being a grandmother and then you could stop being a mother and could just be a little girl. 

00:20:45
[sil.] 

00:20:50
CARL WHITAKER And then you could disobey her. 

00:20:50
ILEANA Then you can what? 

00:20:55
CARL WHITAKER Then she could disobey you. 

00:20:55
ILEANA Oh. 

00:21:00
CARL WHITAKER That might be fun, you know. You could go to Disney Land without even asking her permission. 

00:21:10
[sil.] 

00:21:15
CARL WHITAKER You think she could stand that? Being your little girl? 

00:21:20
ILEANA I think it would be very hard. Uh, she's always played the uh, the mother and uh, the protector. Uh, and she's always played the uh, dual role of mother and father. 

00:21:40
CARL WHITAKER You could play being helpless, maybe. Would you think that, could you play being helpless? Make believe you're a cripple? 

00:21:50
[sil.] 

00:22:15
ILEANA What would I do? Well, probably nothing. 

00:22:20
CARL WHITAKER Huh. You wouldn't be a bad little girl if you played being a little girl? You'd wanna be a good little girl? 

00:22:35
[sil.] 

00:22:40
ILEANA A good girl. 

00:22:40
CARL WHITAKER Oh, that's terrible. All these years of being a mother and you don't even wanna be a bad little girl? 

00:22:50
[sil.] 

00:23:10
DR. ELLIS Ha-, having been raised very strictly, being a child is not something she's familiar with. 

00:23:15
CARL WHITAKER What'd you say? 

00:23:15
DR. ELLIS That having been raised in a very strict family, being a child is something she's not familiar with. 

00:23:20
CARL WHITAKER Well, that's what makes it good fun. If you're being familiar with it, it wouldn't be any fun. If you do something strange, then it's fun. 

00:23:35
[sil.] 

00:23:45
ILEANA I dunno what would be best, either to have fun or not to have fun. 

00:23:50
CARL WHITAKER Oh, I think it's best to have fun. You oughta have fun before you die. It'll be too late afterwards. 

00:23:55
[sil.] 

00:24:00
CARL WHITAKER You, you can't, uh, you think you can fun in heaven? 

00:24:05
[sil.] 

00:24:10
ILEANA I don't think so if I don't behave here on earth. 

00:24:15
CARL WHITAKER If you behave on earth then you get uh, fun in heaven? 

00:24:20
[sil.] 

00:24:25
ILEANA Uh, according to our religion, yes, the Catholic. 

00:24:30
CARL WHITAKER Seems like a long time to wait. 

00:24:35
ILEANA Well, I'll wait. 

00:24:35
CARL WHITAKER Well, I'm sorry about that. What do you think he oughta do about this problem of teaching her daughter, a little girl? 

00:24:50
[sil.] 

00:25:10
ILEANA I believe that she should let uh, her be an independent woman. 

00:25:15
CARL WHITAKER Well, she can't, nobody can let you be an independent woman. You have to do that yourself. 

00:25:20
[sil.] 

00:25:25
CARL WHITAKER If somebody let you, then you aren't independent. Now, cuz if she could be an independent grandmother and then become an independent little girl to her daughter, 

00:25:40
[sil.] 

00:25:45
CARL WHITAKER You think you could stand it if she became her mother? 

00:25:55
[sil.] 

00:26:00
RUBEN I don't uh, know. No, not really. 

00:26:10
[sil.] 

00:26:15
ILEANA I could see that. Yeah, I could understand that. 

00:26:20
CARL WHITAKER Do you have any idea how you could help her do it? 

00:26:25
[sil.] 

00:26:35
ILEANA Not really. 

00:26:35
CARL WHITAKER You ever taken her out on a date? 

00:26:40
ILEANA Repeat that? 

00:26:40
CARL WHITAKER Has he ever taken her out on a date? 

00:26:50
[sil.] 

00:26:55
ILEANA No. 

00:26:55
CARL WHITAKER You think she could stand it? 

00:27:00
[sil.] 

00:27:05
CARL WHITAKER I guess I should have said, could she stand it? 

00:27:10
ILEANA Who? 

00:27:10
CARL WHITAKER You. 

00:27:10
ILEANA Oh. 

00:27:15
[sil.] 

00:27:25
CARL WHITAKER Oh, I can't take her. Is somebody around here can take her? Take her to the boy's room and see how that works. 

00:27:35
[sil.] 

00:27:40
RUBEN Thank you. 

00:27:40
CARL WHITAKER It's wonderful, they have one of those nice things to go on a picnic with. I was wondering, what would happen if you invited her to a dance? 

00:28:00
ILEANA I think it would be kinda boring. 

00:28:05
CARL WHITAKER Well, then that would be her problem. She oughta make it non-boring for you. 

00:28:10
[sil.] 

00:28:20
CARL WHITAKER Do you think you could go on a date with him? You think he could dance? 

00:28:30
[sil.] 

00:28:35
ILEANA "Son-in-law." 

00:28:35
CARL WHITAKER Yeah, could, could you go for a dance with him? 

00:28:45
ILEANA In a family uh, party, yes. 

00:28:50
CARL WHITAKER Oh, no, I mean in a public dance. 

00:28:55
[sil.] 

00:29:00
ILEANA Yes, because I see him as a son. 

00:29:00
CARL WHITAKER Do you think he's any good dancing? 

00:29:00
JUANITA Yes. 

00:29:00
CARL WHITAKER Oh. Don't stay out too late. You have to be careful about these things. How could you get it so it wasn't boring for you? 

00:29:20
[sil.] 

00:29:25
CARL WHITAKER Orchids? 

00:29:30
[sil.] 

00:29:35
ILEANA Yeah, I could buy her some flowers. You, could you stand it? 

00:29:40
ILEANA Yeah. I'm not the jealous type. 

00:29:45
CARL WHITAKER You're not jealous. 

00:29:45
ILEANA No. Whoa, careful about that "non-jealous" type. You know, he may understand other things than you're saying. I was just talking about your mother. I wasn't trying to pollute your family. 

00:30:00
ILEANA He can go out with my mom. 

00:30:05
CARL WHITAKER If you say you're not jealous of him, he may resent that. That's one of the ways of saying I don't love you. 

00:30:15
[sil.] 

00:30:30
RUBEN Yes. 

00:30:30
ILEANA Yeah, I could think about that. Yeah, I could think that. 

00:30:35
CARL WHITAKER I was just having another crazy thought. What do you think would happen if your mother were here? 

00:30:40
[sil.] 

00:30:45
ILEANA Living together? 

00:30:50
CARL WHITAKER Yeah. 

00:30:50
RUBEN Oh, big problems. 

00:30:50
ILEANA Big problems. 

00:30:55
CARL WHITAKER Alright, then we'd have three mothers trying to find one man. 

00:31:00
RUBEN Yeah. 

00:31:05
[sil.] 

00:31:10
CARL WHITAKER How does your mother stand you being so far away? 

00:31:15
[sil.] 

00:31:20
ILEANA At the beginning it was very hard for her. 

00:31:25
[sil.] 

00:31:30
ILEANA One of the reasons is because uh, since my mother had eight children, 

00:31:35
RUBEN Yeah, y estoy her baby. 

00:31:35
ILEANA And I'm the baby. And their relationship between mother-son has been a very close relationship. And at the very beginning she could not accept that. Uh, for me to be far from her, to be apart from her. 

00:32:00
CARL WHITAKER So is this woman your new mother? 

00:32:05
[sil.] 

00:32:10
ILEANA In what sense? 

00:32:10
CARL WHITAKER I dunno. Just takes care of you. Cuddles you when you need cuddling. 

00:32:15
ILEANA Yes. She has played the role of mother. 

00:32:25
CARL WHITAKER So it's gonna be more difficult for you to take this mother to a dance because she resembles your mother? 

00:32:35
[sil.] 

00:32:45
RUBEN Yes. 

00:32:45
CARL WHITAKER Could you imagine taking your mother to a public dance? 

00:32:50
[sil.] 

00:32:55
RUBEN No. 

00:32:55
CARL WHITAKER That'd be too much. So you may have to think some more about this invitation for your mother-in-law, cuz if she's like your mother, it may be scary. 

00:33:10
[sil.] 

00:33:15
ILEANA Yes. 

00:33:20
CARL WHITAKER You think if you went, took her to a dance and taught her how to be a teenager, then she could move to be your wife's little girl? 

00:33:30
[sil.] 

00:33:50
ILEANA I just can't imagine that. It's hard for me to imagine that. 

00:33:55
[sil.] 

00:34:00
CARL WHITAKER You think if you could get your mother-in-law to be a teenager, you could teach your wife how to be the mother to this teenager? 

00:34:15
[sil.] 

00:34:25
ILEANA I think so. 

00:34:30
CARL WHITAKER That's nice. Why doesn't your wife uh, treat your mother-in-law like a little girl anyway? 

00:34:40
[sil.] 

00:34:55
ILEANA It must be our Latin uh, culture and heritage that we see our mother at a certain standard, very high, the highest. And uh, I believe it, it might be the same in our cultures. 

00:35:15
[sil.] 

00:35:20
ILEANA I don't think that in our culture, the Hispanic culture, we would be able to treat uh, the mother as a child. 

00:35:30
CARL WHITAKER Oh, I wouldn't either, I was just trying to get you to do it. 

00:35:35
[sil.] 

00:35:40
CARL WHITAKER But it might be a fun game for you and grandma to play. 

00:35:45
[sil.] 

00:35:50
ILEANA Could be. 

00:35:50
CARL WHITAKER And you the, the crazy part is that I didn't plan it this way, but now when I look at what we've been doing, if you could do that, it might help your daughter be more comfortable being a little girl. 

00:36:05
ILEANA Your daughter? 

00:36:05
CARL WHITAKER Your daughter. 

00:36:05
ILEANA Oh. Okay. 

00:36:10
[sil.] 

00:36:25
ILEANA I think you're right. 

00:36:30
[sil.] 

00:36:35
CARL WHITAKER We could even mix it further. You know, we could get your daughter to be your mother. You think you could be her mother? 

00:36:50
RUBELINA I don't think so. 

00:36:50
CARL WHITAKER Have you ever tried? 

00:36:50
RUBELINA No. 

00:36:50
CARL WHITAKER Oh, you should. You know, make her eat her breakfast food, make her get her clothes on in time to go to work. 

00:37:00
RUBELINA But I don't know how to cook. 

00:37:00
CARL WHITAKER Oh, just tell her. If you're the mother, you don't have to do it. All you have to do is tell her to do it. Then if she doesn't do it right, you can spank her. 

00:37:15
[sil.] 

00:37:20
CARL WHITAKER Wouldn't that be fun? 

00:37:20
RUBELINA Yes. 

00:37:20
CARL WHITAKER You could get Dad to help you if she was, you know, fighting back. He'd have to hold her so you could spank her. But you were the mother. I would even think it's worth, you know, if we could work it out, she could be your little sister. Would you like a little sister? 

00:37:40
RUBELINA Yes. 

00:37:45
[sil.] 

00:37:50
CARL WHITAKER She says she wants a little sister, and all you'll have to do is get to your second childhood and you can be a little sister. I'm already there. 

00:38:00
[sil.] 

00:38:10
CARL WHITAKER Cuz I make like I'm, 

00:38:10
ILEANA That would be very hard. 

00:38:10
CARL WHITAKER When I go back home, I make believe I'm a little boy. Which is really true. 

00:38:20
[sil.] 

00:38:35
ILEANA That also depends on, on your upbringing. Uh, you were brought up by your, by your parents and that sometimes you do uh, feel like you are a little child. 

00:38:45
CARL WHITAKER Sure. That's why I think she'd need to have her son-in-law help her. 

00:38:50
[sil.] 

00:38:55
CARL WHITAKER I'm not worried about your being a teenager, I'm just worried about whether he can stand being your boyfriend. 

00:39:05
[sil.] 

00:39:15
CARL WHITAKER But you could have a, you could go to a dance across town or you could have the, go do a dance in church where everybody knew it was all right. Although some people would probably talk. 

00:39:30
[sil.] 

00:39:40
ILEANA Why would they start talking? 

00:39:45
[sil.] 

00:40:25
DR. ELLIS Said that other people might think different things to have an older woman with a younger man. They may be judgmental of her. 

00:40:30
CARL WHITAKER Oh, they'd think all sorts of naughty things, but that's part of the fun. 

00:40:35
[sil.] 

00:40:55
DR. ELLIS She says she's only interested in her, in her son-in-law as a son-in-law. 

00:41:00
CARL WHITAKER Oh. Well I'm, I'm really much more interested in your going there and upsetting those people. Cuz then they might never be able to think of you as an old lady again. 

00:41:15
[sil.] 

00:41:50
DR. ELLIS She's still very concerned of how people would view the family. 

00:42:00
CARL WHITAKER You what? 

00:42:00
DR. ELLIS She has a lot of concern about people would view the family. 

00:42:05
CARL WHITAKER Oh, I think they'll, they'll, but I think you oughta get over that. Cuz people're all worried about themselves. They don't worry about somebody else. 

00:42:20
DR. ELLIS She says you're right. I'm not really interested in the other people. But they're, I'm just more interested in what I'm thinking and that's my concern. 

00:42:35
CARL WHITAKER Sure. Well, you can have all sorts of funny thoughts if you took your son-in-law to a dance. Maybe you could find out why he fell in love with your daughter. 

00:42:50
[sil.] 

00:43:00
CARL WHITAKER But then you'll probably also worry about if you get to be your daughter's daughter, then she's gonna have to learn how to push you around and make you do things. And I don't know how good she is at that, either. 

00:43:20
[sil.] 

00:43:30
DR. ELLIS She says I know, I know that it would be nice. 

00:43:35
[sil.] 

00:43:45
DR. ELLIS The, the, the reason that I've been close is because of the younger children, taking care of them and making sure they stay outta trouble. 

00:43:50
CARL WHITAKER Yeah, but if you're going to be your daughter's daughter, then you could still be a babysitter, but you could have fun at it instead of working hard at it. 

00:44:05
[sil.] 

00:44:10
DR. ELLIS She's right. She says well maybe I would be, it might be better if I could be a little bit more separated. 

00:44:20
CARL WHITAKER Well, being a teenager would be a lot more separated. You'd have to listen to this terrible music, you know, and that would be a problem. 

00:44:35
[sil.] 

00:44:40
CARL WHITAKER But I. 

00:44:45
[sil.] 

00:44:55
DR. ELLIS She said, 

00:44:55
CARL WHITAKER You need to be careful. 

00:45:00
DR. ELLIS She said I'd like to it to be the way it used to be where I could play my radio loud and watch TV, but now everybody bothers me. 

00:45:05
CARL WHITAKER Yeah. Well I think, I'm worried about another thing, too. If he does take you to the first dance, I don't think you oughta take you to a second one. Cuz then people would really talk. 

00:45:20
[sil.] 

00:45:30
CARL WHITAKER Maybe he could find somebody else, you know, the second time. We're gonna have to stop, guys. This is terrible. I wish we had another hour. Questions you'd like to ask me before we stop? 

00:45:50
[sil.] 

00:45:55
CARL WHITAKER Mom? 

00:45:55
ILEANA Um, no, not really. 

00:46:00
CARL WHITAKER Grandma? Question you'd like to ask me? 

00:46:05
[sil.] 

00:46:10
ILEANA She just can't think of anything to ask you right now. 

00:46:15
CARL WHITAKER Sis, is there anything you'd like to ask me? 

00:46:20
RUBELINA Me? 

00:46:20
CARL WHITAKER Yeah. 

00:46:20
RUBLINA Oh, no. 

00:46:20
CARL WHITAKER If you get to be your mother's mother, please be nice to her. 

00:46:25
RUBELINA I will. 

00:46:30
CARL WHITAKER Thank you. Questions you wanna ask me? Or we can talk afterwards. We're gonna talk about you after you're back's turned. You know, Lord knows what we'll say. Thanks very much. Good luck to you. 

00:46:55
[sil.] 

00:48:10
DR. ELLIS You did a, a fantastic job given the language uh, difficulties and uh, and such. 

00:48:25
[sil.] 

00:48:30
CARL WHITAKER Yeah. I'm sorry about that. Like, like this? Hear me now? 

00:48:40
DR. ELLIS Try, try, try this. 

00:48:45
CARL WHITAKER Can you hear me now? Oh, boy. Now can you hear? I, I did accidentally this happened to me, I didn't do it, I've done the same kind of thing many times before. I don't really know how we got into it, but I was clear. Oh, I guess we got into it because her husband was dead. I asked if she had any other men in mind and then I went to the daughter and she said she was still being a little girl to her mother. Then I asked about reversing it, whether Grandma could be a little girl to her daughter. And it went from there in what was easily evolving a uh, a reordering of all the family um, role structures. So that we went from grandmother being the teenager to the question of whether the husband would have the courage to date this teenager who was 69 and then whether the wife of the husband would have the tolerance for her husband taking his mother-in-law out for a public dance and what fun it would be to defy the community. Or if she didn't want to go to a public dance across town, she could go to a church, a church dan-, church dance where everybody knew her and um, then uh, they would not know how old she was. And then if she became a teenager and her daughter had to be her mother, could she tolerate the daughter's pushing her around and demanding that she uh, do things. And as we got this structure set up and the wife said she was uh, not jealous of uh, her husband, which I was uh, playing with too. Then I asked the daughter if she could be the mother to her mother. And then whether the father could stand his daughter being the mother to his wife. Once you get into this kind of what I call parallel play or um, game play or metaphor or distortion of the family fixed roles, I become more and more convinced that you can stay in it right through to the end, that it, there's no necessity for your moving away. I'm the consultant, you see, which gives me a whole different kind of freedom than the therapist has. He's set up the anesthesia. He's set up his connection to the family which makes them protected from me, makes me free to go ahead with the operation and to play in my way much more openly and much more irresponsibly than he has to do because he's the mother and I'm the father. So he's the one who's with them and I'm just coming in to raise hell and then go off to work. Um, unfortunately, I didn't have any toys to play with the little boy or the little girl which uh, is kind of sad cuz I would, my office ordinarily is full of 20 or 30 and uh, we have all sorts of fun between what little conversation has to go on. 

00:52:40
DR. ELLIS One of the things that the grandmother shared with me while you were conversing with the uh, father was that um, she said that she never learned how to socialize, that she was raised in a very strict family and that would be one of her concerns is that she doesn't know how to en-, um, participate in a social role. Um, and I think that really um, um, gives a lot of support for how you were addressing the fixed roles that they had locked themselves into. 

00:53:10
CARL WHITAKER To look back at it, of course, I moved out of my fixed role when I got down on the floor. And underneath the things we said and did was the flirtation between grandma and me which was, I think, made available because we talked about death. How long before she died? How long ago her husband died? Because I think if you start with death you can move to anything afterwards. Like Camoo says about suicide. You know, if you can't decide whether suicide is uh, the next step, you haven't decided whether you could live the next time. So, and then we went, we moved undercover, as you look back at it, all through the incestuous implications of the son-in-law and the daughter and the anxiety, which to me means the daughter, the little girl, is trying to be responsible for the anxiety of the family and is being put in the position of being the maternal person. And uh, I didn't know that, I didn't think about that, but looking back on it now, it feels that that may be useful for her anxiety attack, that she may be panicked about the uh, strange thing of father living away from home. Going back to that, that they have two houses, and grandma and the children and the mother live in one, and the father lives in another, quote unquote. Which isn't quite true, but leaves all sorts of funny inferences and implications that may or may not be relevant. 

00:54:55
DR. ELLIS I'm curious as to how you um, viewed what the father shared regarding his attachment to his mother and how that might be playing into the family dynamic. 

00:55:05
CARL WHITAKER Yes. That was fairly deliberate. If you said it, one set of grandparents, you need to get the other set of grandparents in in fantasy. So I said well, what would happen, what would this have to do if your mother was here? And he said you mean living with us? And I said yes, and he said ugh. That would be terrible. And then I asked about his being a little boy to his mother, and then when he agreed to that, I said then I suppose you're the little boy to your mother-in-law too? So we flipped the generations in another way in the same sense. But this whole process of setting up a play family, setting up a, a distorted, crazy kind of family, because a crazy family is more anxiety-free. So if this family can get some bit of craziness in their life, then the little girl won't have to take all the responsibility that she's carrying and uh, suffering from. I hope. 

00:56:20
DR. ELLIS Um, I, no, I really think that the, what was really um, made conscious to me for, during this, is how fixed they were, they were being in their roles and uh, the inability, what I saw was the father being very polarized against the family and the grandmother being on the other side of that and uh, maybe the girl being stuck in the middle. And I guess I really enjoyed the play that you were engaged in with the family. I think that will be a way of loosening them up. 

00:56:45
CARL WHITAKER Somebody asked me once at the last one of these conferences, five years ago, how you know whether an interview's been successful. And the answer that occurred to me then was if you enjoy it then it's been useful. If you don't enjoy it then they're apt to be more anxious, so I like to work for some way of having fun myself. I think I'm more of myself if I am having fun, and I enjoyed this, even though there were parts of it that were stressful, and I felt the pain that waiting for all the translation that was necessary and for not being able to uh, move more smoothly. I appreciate your tolerance. I'm sorry we don't have three hours. I had dreamed of it being this long.
