ROSIE P. BINGHAM Okay. So, I'm going to talk today and hopefully, it, it will only be about, ah, maybe 40 minutes. And if I go fast, maybe less. So, 25 years later, is the circle of inclusion any bigger? 

00:01:00

00:01:00
ROSIE P. BINGHAM  So, some things in life I just don't expect to have happened to me and yet I've gotten lots of wonderful and unearned surprises like Gloria's poem. In the field of Psychology, it seems that rewards and recognitions go most often to those among us who are researchers and writers. Those who don't hide their light on. So, while I have written a little and presented a little more, ah, I, I really am not, ah, a researcher. And so what I write about is mostly about what I believe and what I do and I wanna thank all of you who've been willing to ah, listen and to read that stuff, though, though, sometimes, I think it is deadly boring, but you read it anyway. So, what was unexpected this time? Well, being invited to the Winter Roundtable was just a big surprise because when I finally found the Roundtable, I discovered that I admired and even envied a little bit, those who'd receive such invitations to come and talk. And so, I found at the Roundtable, outstanding psychologists, researchers and students and I really felt like I had become among the elite. And I feel that way today, but as the elite with heart? So, when Madonna sent me the invitation and asked if I would come and talk, I said, "Oh, heck, yeah! I'll come and talk. I've been wanting to do this a long time." But then when she said, "Well, how about accepting, instead, the Janet Helms Award for Mentoring and Scholarship?" And so, I was just really floored and so honored and so humbled until I did something I never do. I immediately sent out an email to people telling them, "Hey, guess what?" Now, I don't know if these people even know Janet, (laughs) but, you see, Janet Helms remains, in many ways, bigger than life to me. So I was just really honored. 

00:03:15
ROSIE P. BINGHAM  Now, if any of you have every deigned to read anything I write or listened to, to, to me present, you'll know that there are two people that I mention a lot, and those two people are Bill Cross and Janet Helms. And I think it's because they help me to find my way through the maze of what it meant to be a Black American. So, you might ask me, "Why Bill and Janet?" It seems to me that those two people helped, more than anyone, to capture my head and my heart. Ah, Bill started with my heart and Janet captured my head. Now, there's not a real distinction between head and heart, not really. But it serves my purposes to think of it that way, as I was wading through the fog. From darkness to light, in the conversion from Negro to Black. Now, some of you, and maybe not many, but some of you maybe know, ah, some of my story or at least part of it. I was born whole and perfect in a hospital near the plantation in Mississippi where I began my journey as a little colored girl. "Colored" was what Black folk in America were called before we were called "Negroes." At least, I knew us as "colored" before that more prestigious word, "Negro." I lived on a plantation until I was four, five. Just long enough to begin to learn about picking cotton, about having lots of brothers and sisters. A working mother who spanked me in front of the neighbor who came down the road to tell her what I had done wrong. A father who gave me a direct blood transfusion to save my life. Learning in a classroom where all the students where in the same room, and all the, all the students had the same teacher. And long enough to learn that skin color mattered and that I was not in the circle because my skin was too dark. So, I began inching my way to that pre-encounter stage of status of racial identity development. Though I was born whole and perfect, I began to crawl into that pre-encounter space that would tell me for years that I was not good enough, and in fact, inferior. We moved to Memphis, Tennessee and I became a Negro. Went to a separate but equal elementary school, as I lived in my separate but equal neighborhood. My father worked his separate but equal job picking up the garbage in Memphis. The white guys ran the business and they drove the garbage trucks. My world was small and fairly segregated. The neighborhood was segregated. The church was segregated. The school was segregated. Although, occasionally, the white insurance man came by. And sometimes, I would go the Black folk's clinic to see the white doctors. I'd walked downtown to pay rent to the white landlord. And sometimes, the white superintendent of schools would come by and give us some kind of motivational, inspirational remarks to those separate but equal little Black children in the elementary or high school. The information that flowed into my little circle confirmed that I was inferior and smart at the same time. So, I heard this stuff outside of my circle telling me that the entire race of Negro people were inferior. Inside my little circle, I heard that I was not good enough because I was dark-skinned, black and ugly. Within our own extended family, we, ah, we did it to each other too. We separated into light and dark-skinned. My immediate family was poor. I mean, you know, if my daddy was picking up garbage, we were poor. Dark- skinned, so we were the biggest outcast, except I was smart and that helped. My dad worked two jobs, was an alcoholic and abusive. My mother cleaned houses for white women. And I escaped into the world of books and I still do that. This segregated, small circle of life went on for me like that until I went to college, and, bam, encounter. An international student said to me, "You Americans." and I looked around and he was talking to me. I'd never thought of myself as American. At first, so, I didn't realize he was talking to me. And then, I made another discovery while I was at college. I learned that all white people were not smart. 

00:08:40

00:08:40
ROSIE P. BINGHAM I discovered, saying, "Say it loud, I'm Black, and I'm proud." And then, Dr. King was killed. My hair went from pressed to the biggest Afro I could get by blowing my hair. Now, didn't y'all ah, blow your hair? I blow my hair. I got me some dashikis, some big old platform shoes, and some huge earrings. And I became co-chair of the Black student group BLOC, Black Leadership, Organized and Consolidated. We held our President captive. Oh, by the way, that's my fear about being a Vice President for Student Affairs. 

00:09:30
[sil.] 

00:09:30
ROSIE P. BINGHAM (laughs) Ah, you know, they say, "What goes around, comes around." Anyway, we held them captive and made demands and, oh, yes, we had gone from being Negro to Black. So, you couldn't call me Negro and heaven help you if called me colored. It was revolution time. Immersion? After I graduated from college at age 22 and became a manager for the telephone company and supervised women, ages 18 to 60. Some were single moms, some were single grand moms and many were wondering how to feed and shelter their children from paycheck to paycheck. And I've realized that the revolution I envisioned would have to wait a while or change. I also learned that I needed to know a lot more than I had learned in college. And so I went to graduate school, where I began my introduction to Bill and later to Janet. I didn't know them personally, just through their writing. And that was when the fog began to lift and light was visible. I began to know that inferiority and superiority are merely flipsides of the same coin. There is no feeling inferior, without feeling superior. There is no feeling superior, without the harbinger of inferiority. Could this be the beginning of immersion? My circle of inclusion became bigger or at least it had the appearance of being bigger. I now live in a desegregated setting. There were more white people in my life. But can you really have a circle of inclusion if you don't really love and accept yourself? If there is a part of you, broken memories from this morning, that still does not remember that you came in to the world whole and perfect? It takes a long time to recover from the mental illness brought by the disease of racism. A racism that can be blatant but it can morph and mutate and hide behind and in between poverty, in a group conflict, borders and walls, class and age, homophobia or rel, ah, religion. Saying it loud, "I'm Black and I'm proud," big Afro, right clothes, right organization, right words can make it seem that the effect of racism have worn off. But what are the signs that recovery had not happened? I say in me, it was in my approval seeking behavior. I wanted to be approved off by virtually everybody I met. It could be the person picking up my garbage. It could be my professor. It could be a little kid in my Sunday school class. 

00:12:55
ROSIE P. BINGHAM  Approval seeking behavior, grounded in a sense of inferiority began to appear when that little girl learned that her skin was too dark and she forgot that she was born into this world, whole and perfect, just as she was. And so what does that, this have to do with "25 years later, Is the circle of inclusion any bigger?" Well, I can tell you that 25 years ago, I've never heard of the Winter Roundtable at Teachers College. I lived in Gainesville, Florida and worked at the counseling center, where we have finally decided to seek APA accreditation. And I can tell you that in our superiority, we thought APA accreditation was beneath us. Nobody could tell us what to do. Then this funny little thing start to happen. Our intern pool began to shrink and the handwriting was on the wall, you will get accredited or not have any interns. And so we got a consultant. The consultant came and told us that, "Well, you know, the first thing is that none of you are involved in APA. You have got to change that." And so, so we said, "Okay." Now, I had started my work with APGA. Any of you, any of you are old enough to know what that means? American Personnel and Guidance Association, now ACA. And not only did I start there, my, ah, home organization was something called the Association for Non-White Concerns. Don't you love that name? The Association for Non-White Concerns, and I was mainly concerned with Black people. I had not really begun to include other ethnic groups in my circle. In graduate school, I was challenged to think at least about gay, lesbian, bisexual individuals. But, we talked about ethnicity, but my little circle was fairly small and I just didn't have any in there. So by the time 1983 came around and I was going to my second APA convention. So I've been one time, but I got to tell you that it was in San Francisco. My good friends and I were having a really good time and they were gonna(ph) drop me off. I actually got the handle of the door in my hand. And I said, "Ah, nah, let's go have some fun." And so I left and never did even go in the building. 

00:15:25
ROSIE P. BINGHAM So when I got to my second APA convention. I was surprised to find that it was so isolated and cold. It was next to impossible for me to find people of color. And I had never had my research challenged in such a public way nor watched other have theirs, challenged so negatively. I thought it was just a really weird place. Even when my friends and I finally found some people of color in Division 17, five years later, we found finks(ph). People seemed not to really like each other all that much and to be confused and certainly to be exclusive. As a young professional, it was exceedingly difficult to find acceptance from anyone. Talk about keeping inferiority in place. Keeping that need for approval right upfront. APA was the place to be. You see when you're busy seeking approval, we're not busy asking anyone into our world of inclusion. So we just feel on the outside of nearly everything in the world, looks like a series of little circles connected by emptiness hostility, narcissism, benign neglect, ignorance, arrogance or indifference. And all of us on the outside feeling inferior, merely want to get in somewhere. Well, one of my colleagues and I, shared it with Naomi Meara, then president of Division 17, our frustration of trying to be involved. And you all know where she put us? On the ethnic minority committee, which was great. Actually, Madonna and I worked on that committee later on. From there we became slightly more inside of one's circle or another and that was when we really learned what exclusion was all about because this cliques didn't like to interact with each other. Well, that was in 1988. Ten years later I was elected president of Division 17 and it was then my presidential address at that time that I pleaded with us(ph) to draw a bigger circle and talked about the fact that exclusion is easier but inclusion is better and in fact powerful. And asked why don't we get our brothers and sisters who are not here or at least let us join them, in some way let's open our profession more, expand our research more, diversify our student pool more, open the faculties more for more kinds of people doing different kinds of work, especially for more of us who are Black and ugly, queer, model, hot, loud and quiet. We needed to reach a stage of internalization because only then can we draw a big circle of inclusion. So 25 years later, are the circles any bigger? There's so many ways to look at inclusion and exclusion over time. And I found some indications of change in psychology and outside of psychology. And first to start looking at journals, to look at what we had been publishing on multicultural issues. 

00:18:55
[sil.] 

00:18:55
ROSIE P. BINGHAM And found that in 1983, the Journal of Counseling Psychology, had titles like, "Changing Male Attitudes to a Woman's Career Development and Exploratory Study," "Duration Satisfaction and Perceived Effectiveness of Cross-Cultural Counseling," "Mexican-American Cultural Commitment Preference for Counselor Ethnicity and Willingness to Work." So the studies were more concerned with whether or not one race or another, ah, could counsel another group effectively and could men accept women doing male dominated jobs. Now I found this particularly funny because you know, in the cotton picking business, if a woman was told she could pick as much cotton as a man that was a real compliment. There was no question about who dominated what. Ah, by 2007 and 8, the publications where more nuanced, complex and in-depth. We have titles like, Racial Migrate, "Racial Microaggressions among African-American Clients and Cross-Racial Counseling Relationships," Dr. Constantine, that's the title in one of those book, as yours. 

00:20:05
ROSIE P. BINGHAM  "Poverty, Loss and Resilience: The Story of Chinese Immigrant Youth." And then I found this really amazing title. Now, back in 1983, you know, we were fighting about whether or not you ought to even teach multicultural courses and certainly whether not you ought to require them. So in 2007, in TCP, I came across this article, "The 2006 Leona Tyler Award Address. Our Identity: How Multiculturalism Saved the Counseling Psychology." So we went from trying to decide whether or not it ought to be a part to say, it saved it. Now, look at this chart. 

00:20:50
[sil.] 

00:20:50
ROSIE P. BINGHAM Okay. 

00:20:50
[sil.] 

00:20:50
ROSIE P. BINGHAM Okay. Now, if you look at the chart, look at the difference in the publication now, "The Career Development Quarterly" there, began in 1986. But if you look, we divided this by multicultural race, ethnicity, gender, ah, gay, lesbian, socioeconomic status, which you begin to see, is that we experience some change but there are some groups who are way outside the circle. If you look at "class" and if you look at "gay, lesbian, bisexual." 

00:21:35
ROSIE P. BINGHAM  I was told in 1983, when I went to the APA convention. I already told you that it was hard to find people of color and I found out there where reasons for that. One of the reasons is that many people of other ethnicities and races were trying to find their own organizations. In 1968, the Black psychologist have walked out of an APA convention, having a big fight over high risk testing. And so they formed the Association of Black Psychologists. I'm real proud to see that this year they are pushing, giving money to, to the Association of Black Psychology Foundation. When you have now gone passed everyday little issues to raising money, that's advancement. The Asian American Psychological Association was founded in 1972. And in 1980's, they were busy fighting for inclusion of Asian-American subgroups in census data and fighting against the English-only movement in California. The National Latinos Psychological Association was founded in 1979, as the National Hispanic Psychological Association. They're very inclusively, focused group. If you go on their website you see they're promoting the Roundtable, the National Multicultural Conference and Summit and the Boston College Institute for Race and Diversity Conference. The Society of Indian Psychology began with the network of Indian Psychology that was started in 1970, by Carolyn Attneave and the American Indian Interest Group that was started in Division 9 of APA, by Joe Trimble. These groups merged and became the Society of Indian Psychologists. So you see, back in that time, a lot of ethnic people were busy, working on their own groups. I found it interesting in a chapter that Joe Trimble, is writing about the, ah, Indian Psychological Association. He said, quote, "Perhaps most important, SIP has been able to support each other quickly as peers and elders. Somewhat ameliorating, the often lone Indian environments, Indian and native students and professionals often occupy." Clearly, he was letting us know that larger circles of inclusion are needed and SIP wants greater visibility even within APA. Within the American Psychological Association, there have been more calls for visibility and inclusion of all ethnic minority and oppressed groups. Inside and outside of APA, there have been calls for bigger circles of inclusion and education research practice and training. The development of the multicultural guidelines began with the task force that Allen Ivey formed when he was president of 17 in 1980 and I our own Derald Sue, chaired the task force back in 1980. The guidelines finally passed this APA practice in 2002, a generation later. Inclusion takes a while. Additionally, inside APA, traditionally excluded groups where permeating those boundaries. The Society for the Psychological Study of Lesbian Gay and Bisexual issues founded in 1985 and then Division 45, Society for the Psychological Study of Ethnic Minority Issues was established in 1986. And here's the timeline. 

00:25:25
[sil.] 

00:25:25
ROSIE P. BINGHAM  Oh. Just to take a look at what was going on, a little bit what was going on in 45. One of the things I like about what I saw in 45, was that if any group, model, real development of racial identity, if you can apply to an organization, I think 45 probably comes closest to doing that of any of the divisions in APA. Now, some people will say that we already have inclusion in the United States and why do we keep dealing with this stuff? And so I wanted, okay, 25 years later, is there any data to help us see what the changes might be? High school drop out rates, just look at this chart and look what happened between 1980, 1985 and 2004. When we can look and see that in 2004, almost 25 percent of Latino youth are dropping out of high school. I have to ask myself, "Are we there yet?" 

00:26:45
[sil.] 

00:26:45
ROSIE P. BINGHAM How about income levels? Consistently, there's a huge gap in income and when I look at a chart like this and I can see that the percentage change in income has barely moved, I'm forced ask myself, "Are we there yet?" Okay. That chart, you probably didn't need to see. It said the same thing. But it looked at poverty rates, and maybe I will go back and let you see it. You see, when you have poverty rates like that and that kind of discrepancy, I wonder about how big the circle of inclusion is in the United States. And you can see that there's just a lot of inequity and the United States that was caused by past discriminations but currently, because of income and housing and education. So, are we there yet with that circle of inclusion? 

00:28:20
[sil.] 

00:28:20
ROSIE P. BINGHAM The other thing that I wondered about, by the way, when I was looking at inclusion, was, I looked around and I thought about 9/11, the Iraq detainees, what's going on in Congo and Rwanda, the killing at the Lane Bryant store. You all familiar with that, those killings that just happened outside Chicago or in Missouri recently? Where the man just came in and shot members of that council? And so I say, "Are we there yet?" 

00:29:05
ROSIE P. BINGHAM  In 1983, the president of APA was a white male by the name Max Siegal, in 1985 the president of APA is a white guy by the name of Alan Kazdin, "Are we there yet?" In 1983, in an airport outside Chicago, Jesse Jackson became the nominee for president of the United States. The other significant thing in 1984 when the actual run happened, who was vice president for the Democrats? Geraldine Ferraro. And here we are in 2008, where the democratic nominee is either going to be a Black man, Barack Obama or white woman, Hillary Rodham Clinton, "Are we there yet?" Maybe, but the Republican candidates, all looked just the same. 

00:30:05
ROSIE P. BINGHAM  Now, some of you have this sheet in 2007, we did this little experiment and I actually didn't know what the political scene would look like this spring of 2008. But last year, we, we did this little survey and some of you have that. We just took this little survey and said, " Wonder what are the chances of this folk being elected president of the United States?" And so we just, my assistant and my graduate student just randomly gave this survey to about a hundred people and said, "Okay, pick that first person on there and between one and, ah, between 0 and 100 percent, what's that person's chance of becoming president of the United States? And so then we start to add things. And you can see we looked at some things that had to do with ah, disability, with gender, with obesity, we even ended with a person who is an atheist. And so, what would you say, if you had to fill those things out? Now, it might look differently. Okay, let's look and see what those people say. By the way, these people were across, across ethnicities. They, our youngest person was about 11, the oldest person was 80, they were educated, they were uneducated, they were the whole nine yard. This is what they said. Did anybody fill that survey out? Did anybody have any ideas why you're sitting out there looking at it? Okay, if you look at the white male, most of the time, you see what people said? Well, I think that one was kinda obvious because so far, 100 percent of the time as far as we know, that's been true. But isn't it interesting, what happened with the rest of those things? That actually they said 50 percent of the time, they said an African-American male could be a president, sometimes they said, ah, a female. Even an atheist, but the answer most of the time for someone who is obese was zero. 

00:32:20
ROSIE P. BINGHAM  What kind of circle of inclusion do we have in this United States? Well, we can see that there's a lot of change but we can also see that everybody is not included. Now, back in APA, at the council of representatives when I was, ah, on council last year, you know we had been working, trying to get representatives from the four major ethnic minorities' psychological associations to have a seat on council. So finally, the council voted to give them seats but the council couldn't pass it by itself, but we did within council and I got to tell you. When those individuals came into council and took their seats, everybody stood up and applauded and I can't tell you the joy that we felt, the thrill that we felt when we watched those individuals come and take those seats. You know, I think that we began to feel just a little more whole and a lot more hopeful even though AB(ph) side voted that they didn't want a seat. We still put it out to the membership to have them vote to make those seats permanent. It takes a two-thirds majority to make that kind of change in the APA policies and procedures. We fell short about that much. We got over 60 percent, but not enough. So the APA membership said no to that dream. And getting there was just a little harder than we thought. I think we were excited in council but naive. We thought the psychologist had change right along with council. But you know we hadn't educated any body, the, not the membership. We hadn't lobbied for it, it was just out there. But at council, every year we would do something on diversity and every time we met, we we're dealing with race and ethnicity and homophobia and all of that. But we didn't do that without membership and I've got to tell you, I was so upset. It made me feel like, "Boy, I'm glad. AB(ph) side said they didn't want it anyway." But I was torn because APA needs to have those voices there. And even though I felt like turning in my APA membership ca, card at that time I just said no because the entire society in the United States is hard on inclusion. And so I said, "No one will live to fight another day." We'll try this inclusion move again. And this time, we'll be better prepared. And we won't allow this failure to happen. You know, it's easy to think that the world has changed, of the world is like you are if you are constantly exposed to difference. 

00:35:35
ROSIE P. BINGHAM  So we expect bigger circles. We have to be intentional about exposing others, about educating ourselves and about staying focused. So, I hope that in 25 years, that the circle will be a lot larger, that the high school dropout rates will be nonexistent. That median income differences will disappear in the upward direction because all of us have to share in the economic drain and further, we have to use our wealth to help our brothers and sisters around the world who need our help. Borders are man made and imaginary. We are our brothers and our sister's keeper. Twenty-five years from now, we must have a huge circle of inclusion. We must help every little girl born into the world remember everyday of her life that she is whole and perfect, neither inferior to any nor superior to any. And each of us must do our part and while I'm not on council and won't have a vote, I won't be silent. And better still looking at this audience, I know that there are lot more of you out there, that you're younger, that you're brighter, setting much higher standards and saying you won't be denied. And after all, isn't that what mentoring is all about? If the Janet E. Helms Award for mentoring and scholarship means anything, it means we are ensuring that others are coming. Now, can't you hear the sound of their footsteps getting louder and louder, their voices becoming stronger and stronger, their words flowing so eloquently saying, "We are the circle of inclusion. Change is here and it is a change we can believe in. So 25 years later, the circle of inclusion is bigger, but 25 years from now, the circle will be even bigger and we can make this change happen and as Obama would say, "Yes, we can." Thank you.
