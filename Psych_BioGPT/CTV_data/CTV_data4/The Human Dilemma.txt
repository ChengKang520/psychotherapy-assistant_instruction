THINKING ALLOWED with Jeffrey Mishlove 

00:00:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome. I'm Jeffrey Mishlove. Our topic today is existential psychology. And with me, is Dr. Rollo. May. Dr. May is one of the founding sponsors of the Association for Humanistic Psychology, and a genuine pioneer in the field of existential psychology and clinical psychology. He was recently awarded the distinguished career in psychology award by the American Psychological Association. He's the author of numerous classic books, including "The Courage to Create", "Love and Will", "The Meaning of Anxiety", "Freedom and Destiny", and "Psychology and the Human Dilemma". Welcom, Dr. May. 

00:01:10
DR. ROLLO MAY Thank you. 

00:01:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's a pleasure to have you here. You, you're really, I think, most known these days as a pioneer in establishing existential psychology as an independent discipline in the, in the clinical area. And, that's a discipline which, unlike most forms of clinical psychology that rely on a medical model or a behavioral model, relies on a philosophical model, and you draw heavily on the works, I think, of philosophers, uh, such as Sartre, Heidegger, Kierkegaard, who , who deal with basic notions, such as anxiety in a different way than, than most medical clinicians do. 

00:01:50
ROLLO MAY, PhD Existential Psychologist 

00:01:50
DR. ROLLO MAY Yes. Well, when I was in my , in the year, I think, '56 or '57, the publishers called me up and asked if I would edit a book on European existential psychotherapy, and I was delighted to hear there was such a book. I hadn't known a th ing about the existential movement. But, I knew that in this country, I believed in it very firmly, cuz they are the ones who emphasize anxiety. They emphasize the, the individual, courage. They emphasize skill feeling, that has to be taken into consideration at least. And they see human beings s struggling, sometimes successful, sometimes not successful. And this was exactly the model that we needed for psychotherapy. Uh, the medical model had turned out to be a dead end. And I welcomed the chance to edit this book of, uh, existential, uh, chapters from Europe. And it was, uh, it, it met my own needs in my own heart. 

00:03:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Would I be correct in, in assuming that when you speak of anxiety, you don't think of it as a symptom to be removed, but rather as a gateway for exploration into the meaning of life? 

00:03:20
DR. ROLLO MAY Yes. Well, you got that exactly right. Now I think anxiety is associated with creativity. When you're ina situation of anxiety, you can of course run away from it, and that's certainly not constructive. Or, you can take a few pills to get you over it or cocaine or whatever else you may take. 

00:03:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You could meditate. 

00:03:40
DR. ROLLO MAY Well, you could meditate, but I think none of those things, including meditation, which I happen to believe in, none of those paths, uh, lead you to creative activity. What anxiety means is it's as though the world is knocking at your door, and you need to create. You need to make something. You need to do something. And I think anxiety, thus, is, uh, well for people who are, uh, they've found their own heart and their own souls. For them it is a stimulus toward, toward creativity, toward courage. It's what makes us human beings. 

00:04:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I suppose of much our anxiety comes form the basic human dilemma of being mortal, of ultimately having to confront our own demise. 

00:04:35
DR. ROLLO MAY Yes. We are conscious of our own selves, our own tasks. And also we know we're going to die. Man is the only creature, men, women and children sometimes even, are the only creatures who can be aware of their death. Uh, and out of that comes normal anxiety. When I let myself feelt hat, then I, uh, apply myself to new ideas. I write books. I communicate with my fellows. Uh, and in other words, the creative interchange of human personality rests upon the fact that we know we're going to die. That the animals and the grasses knows nothing. Uh, but our knowledge of our death is what gives us a normal anxiety, that says to us make the most of these, uh, these years. You are alive. And, that's what I've tried to do. 

00:05:35
DR. ROLLO MAY Another source of anxiety that you described in your writing is, is our very freedom, our ability to make choices and to have to confront the consequences of those choices 

00:05:45
DR. ROLLO MAY Yes, that's right. Freedom is the, uh, also the mother of anxiety. If you had no freedom, you'd have no anxiety. That's why the sleight(ph) is in the films. Or people without any expression on their faces. They have no freedom, but those of us who do have are alert, alive. We're aware that what we do matters. Uh, and, that we only have about 70 or 80 or 90 years in which to do it. So, why not do it and get joy out of it rather than running away from it. But, I think that's a little capsule of the meaning of anxiety. 

00:06:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But, isn't there a little bit of a , a conflict between feeling anxiety and allowing oneself to be open vulnerable to that feeling of anxiety, and then also seeking joy? 

00:06:40
DR. ROLLO MAY Oh, no. Uh, there's a conflict betweent hat, uh, and what's generally called happiness or the, the flat. I would speak of , of the meaningless forms of feeling good. I'm not against anybody feeling good or having happy hours, but joy is something different from that. Joy is the zest that you get out of, uh, using your talents, your understanding, uh, your totality of your being for great aims. The musicians, men who, uh, wrote music, Mozart and Beethoven and the rest of them. They always showed considerable anxiety because they were in the process of loving beauty, of feeling joy when they heard a beautiful, uh, combination of notes. Now, that's the kind of feeling that goes with, uh, creativity. That's why I say the courage to create. Creation does not come out of, uh, simply what you're born with. That must be united with your courage, uh, which both of which cause anxiety, but also great joy. 

00:08:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It seems that, uh, much of our modern culture, though, is an attempt to cope with this fundamental anxiety by diversions and, what you would have called banal pleasures. 

00:08:15
DR. ROLLO MAY Yeah, well you just put your finger on the most significant aspect of modern society. We try to avoid anxiety by getting rich, by making a hundred thousand dollars when we're 21 years of age, by becoming millionaires. Now, none of those things, uh, lead to the joy of creativity that I'm talking about. One can own the world, uh, and still be without the inner sense of , of pleasure, of joy, of courage, of creation. Uh, and I think our society is in the midst of a vast change. The society that began at the Renaissance, uh, now is ending. Uh, and we are seeing the results of this ending of a, a social period. Uh, and the fact that psychotherapy has grown with such great zest, almost every other person in California is a psycotherapist. 

00:09:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It seems that way. 

00:09:30
DR. ROLLO MAY Yes, it does. And, this always happens when an age is dying. You see, the Greeks began their great, uh, age in the seventh, sixth centuries B.C. Uh, and then they taught that beauty and goodness and truth, all these great things that philosophers talked about. Uh, but by the third, uh, second century B.C., or first century B.C., that had all been forgotten. The philosophers now talked about security. And they, uh, tried to help people, uh, get along with as little pain as possible. And they made mottos for human beings. Beauty and truth and goodness had been lost. Now, our Renaissance began the modern age, uh, and at the beginning of an age, there are no psychotherapists. This is taken care of by religion and by art, uh, and by beauty, by music. But the end of an age, every age down through history has been the same. Uh, every other person becomes a therapist because there are no, uh, no ways of ministering to people in need. Uh, and they form long lines at the psychotherapists' office. I think it's a sign of the decadence of our age, rather than a sign of our, uh, great intelligence. 

00:11:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I know in your book, "Love and Will", you refer to the, uh, great poem by T.S. Elliot, "The Wasteland". And, the way so many people that when it wasw first written at the early part of this century, seemed to relate to it, not understanding its prophetic nature. It, it seemed to characterize the, the emptiness of modern society. 

00:11:25
DR. ROLLO MAY Yes. There's a king in the wasteland, remember, was impotent. And the wheat and the grass did not grow. It therefore was a wasteland. And he goes on in marvelous detail. When just about that time, in the 1920's, in the jazz age, there was written another book that is prophetic, and that is "The Great Gatsby". The movie was terrible. Forget the movie, and take, take the book. 

00:11:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE F. Scott Fitzgerald. 

00:11:55
DR. ROLLO MAY F. Scott Fitzgerald. It's a small book. It's a marvelous picture of how our age has disintegrated. He ultimately dies, and dies a completely lonely man. Uh, there is nobody at the funeral, and it's a tragedy. Uh, but Fitzgerald saw that this was happening, not in the jazz age. Then everybody was earning lots of money, and, uh, trying new styles, just like nowadays. Uh, and, uh, but he knew what was going to happen, and therefore "The Great Gatsby". Now, we are now in the age when those things, "Wasteland" and "The Great Gatsby" are coming to fruition. And that's why I, uh, believe that if our world survives, I believe it will, a nuclear threat. If it survives, that we will move into a new age when the emphasis will not be on making piles and piles of money and being scared to death the stock market is gonna drop tomorrow. But, rather the emphasis will be on, on, uh, truth and joy, on understanding, uh, and these, uh, beauty, these things that to my mind, make life really worth living. 

00:13:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You've also characterized our present age as, as one in which modern man seems to be robbed of his own free will, that through Freudian psychology, and other scientific movements we see the human being as, as being influenced by deterministic forces, and threats of great social movements, nuclear war, and so on. That there's nothing that we can do. There's a feeling of helplessness, alienation. And yet you suggest, I think, that through philosophical and existential exploration, we can enter into a, in effect, another state of consciousness where, where we reconnect at our will at a deeper level. 

00:14:05
DR. ROLLO MAY Yes, this is why I wrote "Love and Will". Cuz, you cannot love unless you also can will. Uh, and, uh, I, uh, thought, I think and thought when I wrote that book that a new way of love, uh, would come about. People would learn to be intimate again. They would write letters. There would be a feeling of friendship among people. Now, this is the new age that is coming. And, I don't think it's a matter chiefly of philosophy. See, nowadays there are no philosophers. The last philosopher in this country was Paul Tillich. Uh, and, uh, people now have given up, and they now call philosophy the kibitzing of science, a way of simply looking over the scientist's shoulder and seeing how they can help science put things together. And, that's not philosophy. Philosophy is a deep search for a truth by which I can fulfill myself, by which I can create. Uh, Philosophy is the basis of freedom. It's the basis of goodness, too. It seems to not trouble many modern people, but I think it's a great mistake, cuz of all of our lack of ethics, our lack of morality. We need goodness, and we need beauty. All of those are philosophical terms, but beyond that, you see I'm really a psychotherapist. After saying all these nasty things about psychotherapy, it is the way we have in our end of the 20th century of helping many people to find their, themselves and their way of life that will be satisfying and will give them the joy that, uh, that human beings have certainly a right to have. And I'm not ashamed at all that I'm a psychotherapist. I became a therapist because I saw that's where people unburden themselves. That's where people will show what they have in their hearts. Uh, and they don't show that in philosophy. They don't show it in, uh, well in most religions these days, they also don't show it. This is why so many people in California join the cults. Now, I happen to believe in meditation, and I do it myself. And, we've learned a lot of things from India and Japan. But, we cannot be Indians or Japanese. Uh, and we must find a form of religious observation, religious experience that will fit us as pioneers of the 21st century. 

00:17:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You, a couple of moments ago, you referred to the term, "A New Age", and of course the new age is kind of a popular term, these days, for, for many different, a wide scope of activities. And I would gather from my familiarity with your work that you're critical of, of a good deal of this as, as glossing over, you know, basic human pain and attempting to make nice, and, I suppose these are some of the same criticisms, perhaps that, that Freud had of religion. 

00:17:35
DR. ROLLO MAY Oh, exactly. It's very good to talk with you, because you've read all of what I've written, and you know exactly which way to turn. No, I don't like the new age movement. I think it's over simplified, makes everybody feel temporarily happy. But, they avoid the real problems. Uh, and the new age can come only as we face anxiety, as we face guilt feeling for our, our, uh, misapprehension of what's the purpose of life, as the way we face death, uh, as a new adventure. Uh, now none of these things does the new age talk about. It talks about only being gleeful. And, uh, everybody singing songs. 

00:18:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But, you know, I've sensed another paradox here. I noticed in your book, "Freedom and Destiny" that you, you have a section on mysticism, and you refer to the great Western mystics, Jacob Boehme and Meister Eckhart and their search for, for the divine fire within themselves. 

00:18:40
DR. ROLLO MAY Yes. 

00:18:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And, you, you seem to see that almost as, well, I, I don't know uite what to say, but almost as a model deep existential trolling. 

00:18:50
DR. ROLLO MAY Well, it is. I'm very much a believer and follower of these mystics in our tradition. I'm not a believer and follower of, uh, Rajneesh, uh, or the other. 

00:19:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Maharishi or... 

00:19:05
DR. ROLLO MAY No, Maharishi. Muktananda, I called the most , uh, companionable, uh, of these leaders. But, most of them that come from India, uh, build up cults and get into all kinds of trouble, and are sued for billions of dollars. Uh, and the, uh, cult then collapses. Or, like Jim Jones, who took this 800 and 900 people to an island, and there they were going to set up the perfect community. And they all committed suicide, 919. 

00:19:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE My sense is that your criticism goes much deeper than just the scandals themselves. My sense is that what you're saying is that in this sort of retreat to a mystical lotus land, that, uh, or, or perhaps beliefs such as spiritualism and reincarnation, that people are losing touch with the basic issues of their very existence. 

00:20:10
DR. ROLLO MAY Oh, absolutely. You said it beautifully. I, uh, I'm very critical of these movements that soft pedal our problems. Uh, and that indicate that we, uh, should forget them. I think it's the mystics that you and I were talking about. Jacob Boehme was burned at the stake. Uh, and, uh, the other Christian mystics or mystics of Mohammedism and so on, back in our tradition, are very important. And though the church at that time opposed them, uh, they never the less left great, uh, books full of knowledge that we can read, and we can understand, we can learn from. 

00:21:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I know that some of the existentialist philosophers, such as, uh, Camus and, and Sartre, and perhaps even Jenez(ph) made quite a bit about out of the idea of rebelling against the, the, conventional mores of, of society. And I sense that what you're saying that genuine mysticism has to also involve this, this kind of cutting edge rebellion against the, the, the herd instincts. 

00:21:35
ROLLO MAY, PhD Existential Psychologist 

00:21:35
DR. ROLLO MAY Yes, it does. It's, it's rebellion against the herd instinct. Sartre was very important, uh, in this movement of the rebel. Camus wrote the book, "The Rebel". Uh, and, Paul Tillich, who was my dear and very close friend for some 30 years, uh, he and, and the others of the existentialists understood that joy and freedom come only from, uh, the facing of life, the confronting of the difficulties. Sartre, when France was overrun by the Nazis, Sartre wrote a drama called, "The Flies". This is a retelling of the ancient Greek story of Orestes and the, a little bit of it that I want to quote as that Zeus tries to get Orestes not to go back, uh, to, uh, his hometown, and, uh, kill his mother, which he was ordered to do to revenge his father. Uh, and Zeus says, "I made you, so you must obey me." And, Orestes says, "You made me, but you blundered. You made me free." And then Zeus gets quite angry, and he has the stars and the planets zooming around to show how powerful he is. And, uh, he says,"But do you realize how much despair lies ahead of you if you follow your course?" And Orestes says, "Human life begins on the far side of despair." Now, I happen to believe that, that human joy begins, like the alcoholics, they cannot get over the alcohol except as they get into despair. And then, the AA can take them, and, uh, and free them from alcoholism. That's why I think despair has a constructive side as well as anxiety having constructive effect. 

00:23:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE, PhD 

00:23:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And, and you've mentioned earlier the great artistic achievements of Mozart and, and Beethoven. And, one has a sense, well we even have this term, tears of joy, that when one experiences deep joy, it's because it somehow incorporates the wholeness of human life, and, and we see the joy bubbling up, emerging through the despair itself. And, and that's real joy. 

00:24:10
DR. ROLLO MAY Yeah, yeah. That's, uh, you have understood it very well. 

00:24:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And yet, there's something in, almost intimidating. It's, it's as if, in many of us, as we live our lives and, and, and go through our routines that we're afraid to really drink deeply of, of the fullness of that. 

00:24:30
DR. ROLLO MAY Yes, I know. Well, if it were easy, it wouldn't be effective. It's not easy. Life is difficult, and, uh, has many conflicts in it, many challenges. Uh, but, it seems to me that without those, life wouldn't be interesting. The interest, the joy, the creativity that comes from these is, say in Beethoven's symphonies. A joy, joyful , we adore Thee. That's the end of the Ninth Symphony. And that joyful, joyful comes only after the agony of, it is shown in the first part of that, uh, symphony. Now, I believe in life , and I believe in the joy of human existence, but these things cannot be experienced except as we also face the, the despair, uh, also face the anxiety, uh, that every human being, uh, has to face if he lives, uh, with any creativity at all. 

00:25:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Rollo May, it's been a pleasure being with you, and sort of looking at this very deep issue of agony and ecstasy . I must admit that when I was reading your, your book, "Love and Will" in preparation for this interview, I, I felt after reading the final chapter, almost waves of, of energy pulsing through my body. I almost... 

00:26:15
DR. ROLLO MAY How marvelous. 

00:26:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE ...almost what the yogis would have described as, as kundalini. I mean, it was a very strange feeling of, of ecstasy and agony. It, it seemed as if your willingness to look so directly at life itself is almost a willingness to stare God in the face. 

00:26:30
DR. ROLLO MAY Well, that's marvelous. I'm very happy that you had this experience. 

00:26:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Thank you so much for, for... 

00:26:40
DR. ROLLO MAY It's been a pleasure to be here 

00:26:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE ...with me. It, it, it sort of is just, a, a another concluding note. It makes me feel like I, in appreciating your work, I have a sense of why tragedy was considered the very highest art form... 

00:26:55
DR. ROLLO MAY Ah, by all means. 

00:26:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE ...in Shakespeare, for example. 

00:26:55
DR. ROLLO MAY By all means, yes. The great plays were the tragedies. And in our day too, "The Death of a Salesman" is one of the great plays of the 20th century. 

00:27:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Rollo May, thank you very much for being with me. 

00:27:10
DR. ROLLO MAY Well, I enjoyed it myself. 

00:27:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And thank you very much for being with us.

00:27:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Hello and welcome. I'm Jeffrey Mishlove, and our topic today is existential psychotherapy. With me is Dr. Rollo May, psychotherapist, existential philosopher and psychologist, recipient of the "Distinguished Career in Psychology" Award by the American Psychological Association, a found sponsor of the Association for Humanistic Psychology, and author of many classic books, including "Love and Will","Freedom and Destiny", "The Courage to Create", "Psychology and the Human Dilemma". Welcome, Rollo. 

00:28:30
DR. ROLLO MAY Thank you. 

00:28:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It's a pleasure to be with you. You know, it's interesting, the, the parallel that there may be between the television interview, this one on one situation and the therapy situation, especially, I think, as seen from the existential perspective of, uh, direct encounter between two people. You don't, in, in, in therapy, so much see yourself as a doctor/patient type of relationship that many other therapists will view. 

00:29:00
ROLLO MAY, PhD Existential Psychologist 

00:29:00
DR. ROLLO MAY No, I don't, uh, think that patient/doctor, uh, symbol is very fitting for psychotherapy. I think it's two human beings. One of them is there for the purpose of getting help, and the other is there for the purpose of giving help. Uh, and the second one assumedly is trained, has had a lot of experience. Now, existential psychotherapy means that we deal with the other person as an existing creature. We don't deal with him as somebody who has only problems, but he is existentially real. And that means that he has anxiety, uh, that he has some guilt feelings that come from unexpressed capacities that are within him. He has a need for love, need for other people, for friendship, uh, and he has also a, a presence of anger. All these things, uh, are present in the active human being, and I as the therapist have to and love to understand this person as a total human being, with all of these emotions that I've already mentioned. 

00:30:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Do you see then your role as a therapist to, you mention the word, "help", but I think that's a little different from the notion of cure that we often think of. 

00:30:35
DR. ROLLO MAY I think the notion of cure is for the dogs. We should heave it out. Nobody is cured. Nobody is cured of anything. Uh, you have certain drugs that hold various kinds of bacteria, uh, in abeyance, that control our heartbeat let's, say, and of, of course, I'm all for those. But, they want the answer to life. Uh, life is much more complex than the idea of a cure, uh, would fit. Uh, and life is something that continuously goes on and on. Uh, I see our function as therapists as helping the other person to be more human, help him to discover his own humanity, discover his own capacities for love, capacities for willing, his capacities for creativity. Uh, and that may involve, uh, such things as despair, such things as anxiety. Uh, and if in this relationship of therapist/patient, uh, he can become more aware of these things, become more human, fulfill his capacities or get closer to these, these capacities for these different human reactions, that this is what therapy is about. And, I think the idea of cure is not. 

00:32:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It almost suggests to me that what you're engaged in is a process of honoring whatever symptoms or complaints are brought to you as part of the humanity of, of the client. 

00:32:30
DR. ROLLO MAY Sure, yeah. Exactly. 

00:32:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Can you elaborate on that a little? 

00:32:35
DR. ROLLO MAY Well, the symptoms that, uh, the person brings of one of, uh, my patients is, uh, gets along in life by always being a nice guy. He, he's a patient I had some years ago, but comes to mind. And, uh, he always says that it takes these smiling side or the giving side, uh, and, of course, he gets himself into a great deal of trouble, because he can't make decisions. When he has to make a decision between, uh, two possibilities, a professor he's going to choose, under whom to write his dissertation, he can't choose because he's so interested in being nice to the other person. And, he can't make a choice. Now, he has been very much held back in life by the fact that he always was for the other person, uh, and never learned, uh, how to be constructively angry or how to be creative in the sense that I'm putting forth my insights. And you may like them or not like them, but nevertheless, I'm, this is what I see and do. Uh, this is the way the problem seems to me. Now, in our relationship, I, uh, need to show him more by examples that he brings from his own experience. How he was the youngest child in his family, was the nice boy that everybody loved and took care of. That he has grown as a, grown up man. Not to be out there to please everybody else. And that's what keeps him from making decisions, uh, from choosing what really would be best. Uh, now this is a aspect of his human being or his being human, as you'd put it, that, uh, was not present before. And that's our task as therapists. 

00:34:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I don't understand a new aspect. Do you man getting in touch with, with his past? 

00:35:00
DR. ROLLO MAY No, that's part of it. Getting in touch with his capacities to will, his capacity to, to decide, his capacity not to be the nice fellow all the time, but rather to make a choice, a decision that other people won't like. You see, if you really live out your capacities, you're often going to do things that other people don't like. There's no way around it. Uh, and often your, uh, best creativity, uh, comes at the point where, like Mozart, you're opposing everybody else, but you're writing beautiful music. Or, like Beethoven or like Wagner. Uh, these are all very ornery men, especially Wagner, and especially Beethoven and really Mozart, too. 

00:35:50
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But, my sense is from, from studying some of your writings that in a therapeutic encounter, what you wouldn't do for this fellow is just give him the advice that he ought to be a little... 

00:36:05
DR. ROLLO MAY Oh, by no means. It never helps. Advice that can be had for nothing is generally worth it. Now, I think advice is useless. What we need to help him do is to find within himself, uh, first the awareness, uh, that he's cutting off a great deal of his capacities by being the nice guy. And secondly, that he needs to make decisions that often will be unpopular. Uh, but this is essential if he's going to get any place in his life. Now, these, uh, don't come by way of advice. And they don't come by way of his dreams, although his dreams help us a great deal. They come by way of his seeing the meaning of the various conflicts he gets into. And then, he himself will arrive at the conclusion. Uh, it may be a bit different from what I described, but we want him to fulfill himself as a human being. That's the meaning of humanism. 

00:37:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Your original training in psychotherapy was basically in the Freudian model, I believe. 

00:37:20
DR. ROLLO MAY Uh, well my basic, my original training was when I was teaching in Europe directly after college. I went out to Vienna and had one of the seminars that Alfred Adler put on. It was from him that I learned, uh, the basic phenomena of the human mind. Then I came back, and I was trained at the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, and Psychology. Uh, and that is a relatively Freudian, but it puts a great deal of emphasis upon the culture. Freud did not. He saw the individual person pretty much as an isolated creature. But, the William Alanson White, who sees the culture that the person lives in, is very important for the problems and his, uh, the necessary things to understand, uh, the culture in which this person grew up. It's a different thing to be a Brazilian from being a citizen of New York City. Uh, and we need to help the person no only fulfill his own potentialities, but be part of the culture in which he needs to live. 

00:38:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, one of the basic premises of psychoanalysis is the transference phenomenon. Some psychoanalysts feel that that's the heart of it, is working through the transference when the, the patient, client, projects onto you the feelings of either love or hostility or both that he may have towards his parents or towards another love form. In existential psychotherapy, is, is that as crucial? 

00:39:10
DR. ROLLO MAY Oh, yes. We would call it relationship. And that transference, you see Freud always worked with the idea that the therapist sits here, is cure king. And, whatever goes on in emotion is transference from you to me. But, that's not the case. Always there's a relationship. And what I do, uh, will also be reflected in your approach to me. This patient I was talking about a few minutes ago would be the nice guy in therapy. And, I said to him, "But you never get angry here." Now, just as an aside, do you remember the movie, "Ordinary People"? 

00:39:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Yes. 

00:39:55
DR. ROLLO MAY Well this boy, uh, couldn't really get to the truth until he could fight with the therapist. Uh, and then he could really open up. And it's also in "I Never Promised You a Rose Garden", that the patient had to be able to, uh attack the therapist before there was any, uh, real deep relationship. Now, I would call what Freudians call transference, I would call relationship, and I think it has to happen if the therapy is going to get anyplace. 

00:40:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE So the therapist in your model has to really be prepared to deal with that level of intensity in relationship. 

00:40:45
DR. ROLLO MAY Surely. Yes, one of the things I teach the graduate students who are going to become therapists is they have to be able to confront anger and to, not to give way to it. But, you know, the psychiatrists, and I have never found in "Ordinary People", he didn't, uh, apologize, and lean back as though the patient is all right. What the patient needed was an active actual confrontation. From then on he could trust the therapist. 

00:41:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE There's, uh, a sense in which my understanding of the, the field of psychotherapy, oftentimes the therapeutic relationship will end of level of intensity. Either the client or therapist just can't deal with it, and, and the therapy stops there, perhaps at a crucial moment. 

00:41:40
DR. ROLLO MAY Pity. Well, this is what the poorly taught therapist. There was an article in the "New York Times" a couple of weeks ago, Sunday "New York Times" about a man who had gone for five years, five times a week, and never could get any reaction out of his therapist. Now, obviously, this failed as the man was trying to indicate. Now, excuse me, I, uh, teach graduate students at the California School of Professional Psychology. There they, uh, get their Ph.D. They do clinical work, and work, uh, in the vicinity with various hospitals. And, they learn therapy. And then they are graduated generally after four years. Now, the great problem with psychotherapy in our day is that it is become a way of answering or finding solutions to the person's practical problems. Uh, oftentimes in this seminar that goes on for half a year, the students report on their cases. And the different students will report, one one night, and another another night. Uh, with never a dream being mentioned. They talk only about the practical problems of the patient. How the patient's getting along in his practical life. 

00:43:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Almost like they were social workers. 

00:43:20
DR. ROLLO MAY Yeah, very much. I was, I respect social work, but I think that psychologists, psychotherapists ought to be in their profession. Uh, and they ought not to be social workers. Now, uh... 

00:43:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Isn't, isn't there a sense that it, it takes some luxury to engage in a deep, uh, psychoanalytic or dream exploration or, or, or deep exploration of the self especially, if, if you're having problems dealing with the practical matters of living. 

00:43:55
DR. ROLLO MAY What do you mean luxury? Takes money? 

00:44:00
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Not just money, but a certain amount of psychological freedom. Your mind can't be totally occupied with how you're going to handle your wife or pay the rent. I think money is part of it, but I'm thinking more along the line of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, self actualization is a need that you can't really work on until you've dealt with needs of self-esteem, and, and money and social relationship, etcetera. 

00:44:25
DR. ROLLO MAY Yes, really I don't agree. I think that you can deal with the, uh, basic problems after the second or third session. Uh, you don't get relief, you don't get the, to the deepest problems, but they're already present in dreams. They're already in what Freud called free association. Now, certainly, psychotherapy should be arranged so that the person is not, uh, driven by the need to pay money, that much money, to the therapist. There are plenty of therapists who work at clinics. You can work this way that I'm describing, in a clinic as well as in your own office. What I'm talking about is that we need to get to the basis of humanity in each person. And this basis is quite below the ordinary problems of life. What's he gonna do with his sweetheart? How does he relate to his, uh, mother, father? Sure, these things are important, but below that , uh, are the really, uh, great things which are tremendously interesting. And these things have to do, uh, with the surprise that goes on in psychotherapy, surprise to the therapist and surprise to the patient. They go with the, the originality, uh, of the patient. He's different from everybody else. And each time we learn something. Go with the sense of mystery that is present in human beings. Now, at that point Freud, uh, was a great discoverer. He saw the human beings have a mystery about them. Each one's mystery being unique. And that we can't, we can get to that mystery, not really by talking about how you should deal with your professor or your girlfriend, but going beyond that into the symbols of dreams. See, dreams are great, uh, concoctions of symbols. They come out of the unconscious mind, and I think they're absolutely essential for deep therapy, whether the therapist, whether the patient comes once a week or three times a week, the, that's not, that's not what I'm talking about. What I'm talking about is the deep therapy, the deep therapy that comes out of the knowledge of the dream and also, Freud said, free association. That's where we get to the unconscious, by means of the revery, which is partly conscious, partly unconscious. The train of thoughts that runs on in your mind. It's like looking out of a train window. Each scene is different, but if you were somebody looking at the whole thing, you would see that it, that the whole scene,uh, is, uh, the trees in New Jersey ro the coast of California. Now, I believe that therapy is in crisis. Uh, and this crisis consists of learning gimmicks. When a therapist finds himself bored by dealing with practical problems, how can the person make more money, how can he keep his wife happy. It seems that there aren't too many of the practical problems of life. Uh, but each person is unique in his unconsciousness. Uh, and, uh, we have in therapy unfortunately taught therapists to be good social workers, needing to deal with the practical problems. We've forgotten the deep methods of the dreams, of free association. Uh, and this means then that the therapist gets bored. And when he gets bored, he wonders what he can do. Well, what he can do is invent some new form of therapy. And so we have all sorts of forms of therapy that, quite apart form Freudianism and Jungianism. 

00:48:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE At one point, I made a list of over 100 different types. 

00:49:00
DR. ROLLO MAY Well, you're, you're very helpful there, except I think there are 2 or 300 different kinds of therapy. Where did all those come from? They came from the fact that each therapist who Is doing these practical problem work, uh, has to find some gimmick by which he can interest himself at least. And, they come as a substitute for the deeper portions of you as a human being or as a substitute for getting below why this young man, uh, pretty pleases, and feels the need to be the nice guy. 

00:49:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, these various gimmicks, and, and they, I suppose, range from bio-feedback to massage and body work. There's so many different things these days. They're, they're like detours. 

00:49:55
DR. ROLLO MAY Yes, they're detours, the whole line of them. Now, I'm not criticizing the contribution that some of these, like Gestalt or like body work make, but they should not be confused with deep therapy. Uh, Perls had great insight, and he could use... 

00:50:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Fritz Perls, the founder of the Gestalt Therapy. 

00:50:25
DR. ROLLO MAY His Gestalt Therapy, uh, was on the basis of tremendous psychic insight into the meaning of dreams. But many people, uh, who studied Gestalt psychotherapy don't have that. Uh, and they have to then, find their particular gimmick which still deals with the practical problem. But, they now write a book about it. And they contribute this book. So, now, my son who's a psychologist things there are 400 different kinds of therapy. Now, this is a, this means that the meaning of the mystery of each human being, which ought to be the chief goal of therapy. This is completely lost, uh, and we find therapists who've, the patient, the students say, has a quarrel with the professor. The therapist goes with the student to see the professor, and all this kind of thing. It doen't get at the real, uh, person at all. 

00:51:30
DR. ROLLO MAY In other words, they're caught up in the method of therapy that they're losing touch with the basic existential reality of two individuals in the room. 

00:51:40
DR. ROLLO MAY Exactly. Yes, that's it exactly. Now, what they, what they lose touch from, uh, is the great joy and the great mystery of human beings. They, uh, a sense of surprise. Now, I'm always surprised. Each patient I have, something new comes up that I never dreamt of before. Now, I've been doing psychoanalysis for pretty close to 40 years. 

00:52:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But, surely there must be moments for yourself as well, when you encounter boredom. 

00:52:15
JEFFREY MISHLOVE When I encounter boredom, then I know that we are missing something. We are covering up something that we need to take a different tack. Now, that was a great thing about Freud's use of the couch, because then he could get the free associations without relation to, uh, what the person thinks of him. Uh, I have suggested to a number of my patients that they use the couch. And some of them are very unhappy about it to start with, because they say, "Well, we want to sit and watch your face, and then we can tell whether we should tell a joke or whether we should get more serious or what we should change the subject." Well, that's exactly what I don't want them to do, look at my face and then decide on the basis of what they think they see there, that they decide what they're going to say. Well, this is not psychotherapy at all. But, on the couch Freud learned, uh, they are less at home, but soon they get to be at home with their own spirits, their own vitality, in many ways of looking at, uh, at their own mystery. There are all kinds of things that come up with the patient in dreams and his free association that surprise him. And often, uh, I have met professors say who have been psychoanalyzed who didn't want the therapist to talk, because they were so interested in all the strange things that were coming up in their own dreams, in their own fantasies. I think that shows the depth. 

00:54:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, once you're working with a patient at that level, where they're on the couch, and their own subconscious mind or unconscious mind is providing them with symbols and, and metaphors for their own life, you, there's no way you could be bored, because you're in the area of surprise. 

00:54:20
DR. ROLLO MAY That's right. Precisely. In the are of surprise. I don't mean at all to say that it's necessary for them to use the couch. If they sit in a chair, I want them to get completely engrossed in their own selves. Sometimes if they shut their eyes it helps. I want, and I listen always for their dreams. And if they don't dream, something is wrong. That means there blocking off something. Uh, and this is the way we get to the great interest . I think it's fascinating to do psychotherapy. It does not get boring to me at all. But, it, it gets, if it's at all successful, to the deeper levels where each person is unique. And is a mystery to himself, uh, and a great find, if I may use that term, to the therapist. 

00:55:20
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, many therapists today work with various altered states of consciousness. You referred to hypnosis a while back, and Freud himself began by using hypnosis in his therapy. And today, there's a large therapeutic movement involving hypnosis, based ont eh work of Milton Erikson and others. I wonder if you could comment on that. 

00:55:40
DR. ROLLO MAY Well, uh, I, I don't mean to say that these various forms of therapy are not in their own way effective, but I don't know about Erikson's hypnosis. I think each one of these could be part of a system of, of real psychotherapy. What I mean is using any of these methods as a way, uh, as a shortcut. Body therapy is very important. And, hypnosis with some patients. I certainly wouldn't use it with everybody. I think that it's valuable as way also of getting at, uh, the mystery, the surprise element in human existence. Now, the point is that we need to get back to the essentials that Freud outlined, that Jung, uh, portrayed, that Adler dealt with. And most of these come from Europe as you will see. And, our American habit of making gimmicks out of human relationships, I think is our great problem. Now, what I'm arguing for is that we, uh, need to get to the depths of the human beings, even in short term counseling, and on that basis to then find the mystery of human life, mystery of any, every given person, and the mystery of existence, the mystery of beauty. 

00:57:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE There's a sense in, in the tradition of existential philosophy that we are sort of thrust naked into a meaningless universe. And, and that ultimately as we confront our, our position as mortal beings in, in this kind of a situation, we create our own reality. We create our own meaning. 

00:57:55
DR. ROLLO MAY Well, this is the extreme form of existentialism. It was used by Sartre and was also formed, uh, by several of the French philosophers. Uh, I don't fully agree. My existentialism comes not only from Heidegger and Sartre and, uh, Camus, but it also comes from Kierkegaard. It also comes from Paul Tillich. And it comes from those existentialists who believe that we are thrown into life, but we are thrown there in certain structure, a certain structure within you, let us say, or the structure within me. We are called human. To be a human being is, is not to be, uh, something naked being, but we need to get naked when we are solving various problems. And out of this cultural basis in which you grew and which I grew, there comes a sense of, of, uh, my own mystery, my own subjectivity, that does have an element of nakedness about it. That's why the trusting is necessary, and love is very rare, very important, uh, and that's why one loves another person in ways that one could never really love oneself. What we have for ourselves is esteem, uh, or the meeting of another person and a meaningful love is one of the profound aspects of human culture and human existence. Now,t hat's not purely naked. You bring our culture into that. We change our own forms of life in order to, uh, be more able to , uh, deal with our loved ones. Uh, and I think that existentialism, as Kierkegaard saw it was that we are thrown into a world where we need to discover the pattern, need to discover the ultimate meaning of this life. Whereas Sartre said we are thrown into a world, we have to make the meaning of it. Now, I'm Kierkegaardian. Uh, and I do believe that there is a structure in human life, and the structure of the universe, uh, that we understand and we arrive at through symbols, through finding the structure deep within our own minds, and with finding it in human relationship. 

01:00:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You use the term essentials earlier, and I, I gather that this is what you're referring to. 

01:01:00
DR. ROLLO MAY Oh, yes. This is what, I mean, for the essence of life is the existence except by the existentialist over against essence. Uh, and they do that rightly at the time that the culture is in despair. This is why existentialism always pops up as a form of philosophy when truth and goodness and beauty are lost. Now, the existentialist, uh, look forward to the time when there will be a rebirth of our culture, and then human beings, let us say 20, 50 years, in the 21st century. Then, truth and goodness and beauty again will be sought, uh, by the philosophers and again we'll be interested in, uh, we'll be then the, your quest and my quest. Now, there is something I want to tell you that, uh, I've been putting off for the last four or five minutes. A great way to find the essence of the human being, the unconscious mystery, uh, the subjectivity that the person himself doesn't know is through myths. Uh, these myths which began, uh, thousands of years ago. The myth of Adam and Eve began about 1000 B.C. The myth of Orestes began about the same time. Uh, these are changed by the different authors, just as Jesus reinterpreted, the myth of Adam and Eve, and Esculus reinterpreted, the myth of Orestes, and Sartre and the 20th century when the Germans, Nazis had control of France also reinterpreted this myth of Orestes. Now these great myths exist down through history because they speak out of the depths of human existence. Each culture has to reinterpret them, but they are still there as the, the essence of human existence. Now, let me give you an example. A client of mine, who was a woman who had been in films, came from Los Angeles, very intelligent woman, who had been through psychoanalyses that had been very interesting to her, but the problems were still there. When she go to me, I was in New York at the time, and she was married to an actor on Broadway. Uh, she couldn't go out of the house alone. She had to get a driver to come and bring her to my office. Uh, and in the, uh, she thought she was lesbian, which turned out not to be true. And in her, the end of our, perhaps the first month, she had a dream in which she had a cut in the forehead. And she couldn't find any bandage for it. It was bleeding, and she wanted to put on some bandage. But, what she did find was a kotex. And, she said that she put the kotex on. She said, "It's all right if you don't mind." Now, she told me the dream. We talked a bit about it, that the slip had to do with coming to see me. We were operating on her brain, so to speak, figuratively. Uh, and, uh, it meant also, the kotex, that, which comes with women when they have their monthly periods, and it's connected with birth, uh, of, then can have a baby. And, it has something to do with her unconscious or subconscious feeling that perhaps now this time she would get over her real problems, find her genuine self, which ultimately she did. Now, is that all there is to this story? By no means. This is a great myth. It comes all the way down from 1000 B.C. And that is Athena comes out of the forehead, the split forehead of Zeus. And when his forehead is split, out she comes fully armed and able to become the patron saint of Athens and the great founder of human civilization. Now, this woman, who was my patient, had never read these ancient myths. She did not know this myth which I've just told you. Uh, and in that sense, the great myths down through history speak out of the basic structure of being a human being. And they're valid not only 1000 B.C., but they're reinterpreted in the Greek period. They are reinterpreted, uh, in the Middle Ages, and now they are reinterpreted in my office, uh, when this woman has this dream about Athena coming out of her forehead. Now these things, as I say, were all new to her. But, it shows that there is an essence, a structure, of human existence that comes out in the myths. Freud knew this. This is why he made Eros and Thanatos the basic myths of human life. Eros being love, and Thanatos being death. The conflict between these two equals human existene. Now, this goes on with us, and this superficial psychotherapy that I was talking about a while ago, not only neglects the myths, but it neglects the dreams, but also neglects the myths. It's the universal language of all peoples, of all ages. Now, the myths, this is the book I'm now finishing. It will be called "The Cry for a Myth". The myths are deceivingly important as the structure that we all carry within us and we relive at times of particular significance. 

01:08:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It, it strikes me as I look at mythology that one of the important functions it serves is to define for each culture the relationship between man and the infinite and the divine, the absolute. 

01:08:20
DR. ROLLO MAY Yes. 

01:08:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I, I know there's a movement in psychotherapy transpersonal psychology which focuses in on this aspect of the human being quite a bit, and it's a movement to which you have, uh, taken some opposition. I, I wonder if you could explain that. 

01:08:40
DR. ROLLO MAY Well, I believe that transcendence, uh, is always a goal, as well as, the, uh, as well as damnation. These, uh, as in the Faust myths. They're beautiful myths. I mean, they're horrible stories, but they're beautiful myths. 

01:09:00
DR. ROLLO MAY They seem to clearly define modern man with our technology. 

01:09:00
DR. ROLLO MAY That's right, yup. That's good as Faust says that. Ut, uh, transcendence and damnation are always present. What I criticize transpersonalism for is that you find transcendence, not by overcoming the person. I don't like this word "transpersonal" , but by becoming much more of a person. This is where I think Abe Maslow did not have time to restructure his ideas that have, that have to do with transcendence. He wrote this off rather quickly in his last years before he died. Now, transcendence is one aspect of beauty. It's an aspect of music. Uh, it's an aspect of , of the deepest thoughts we have. Um, human beings can be defined as the creatures who are born like animals, but become able through self-consciousness at about the end, during the first and second year of their lives. And then they learn sooner or later that they are conscious of their death. We are the only creatures, as far as we know, who can be aware that some day we will die. Now, out of this conflict that comes, uh, between our consciousness and the fact that some day we, uh, will die. Out of this there comes our beauty. Uh, out of this there comes the significant things of life. Out of this there comes the transcendent ideas, joy, hopes, uh, that were found by Jacob Boehme, were found by Meister Eckhart, were found by these, uh, these, uh, myths, uh, and these sayings, all the way down through the ages. Now, what I dislike about transpersonal psychology is it makes it all too easy. We get involved in some cult. You see, it's part of the cult. It comes from India, uh, and in this cult, transpersonal becomes very easy to get separated from desperation, from damnation. These things are left behind. We deal now, not with the human self, so the transpersonal might say, but we deal with the soul. Now, this can be destructive for human beings. Uh, because it leaves out a great deal. Uh, it leave out the basic things in you and in me. We have transpersonal ideas, openings, inspirations. We also have the self that we must express, we must control, we must understand that every moment. And you don't , you don't transplant, transcend that. Now, uh, I believe that in our own transition, we don't need to go to India, although it's very helpful to do so. I've learned a lot from meditation and from Muktananda. But, I think that the oversimplifying of our, uh, what transpersonalism does, is oversimplifies therapy. I'm talking about the soul. Where is the self? You and I never get clear of the self. And thank God, because the self is what keeps us with our feet on the ground. And, I think that Meister Eckhart had his feet on the ground, and so did Jacob Boehme. 

01:13:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE I suppose if we look at the great Western spiritual writers, such as Milton or, or Dante, you'd have a sense of, you know, before they reach into paradise, there is the exploration of hell itself. But, Milton wrote, as I recall, that, that the mind creates its own heaven and hell. And, that seems to be what many of the new age people, the transpersonal people and the positive thinkers are saying. If we create our own hell, then, then we can stop creating it. But, you seem to be saying something else. That we should look damnation right in the teeth. 

01:13:45
DR. ROLLO MAY Oh, we certainly should, and, uh, Milton did not at all mean what you are interpreting as meaning, because he said this in "Paradise Lost". 

01:13:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE That's right. 

01:13:55
DR. ROLLO MAY And, he said it with Satan, always present. Now, uh, I think this is a great poem, "Paradise Lost". Uh, and it is great precisely because Satan is in it. Satan is in it all the way through. 

01:14:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Satan is the great hero of the poem. 

01:14:10
DR. ROLLO MAY Yeah, he's the hero. Yeah. And, uh, if you go below the surface of that quotation, you see that, uh, Milton has a much deeper mind. Uh, now I had a patient at one time that was, uh, having a very hard time getting along, talking all the time about things, but never getting underneath. And, finally he said, "I've discovered Satan. Uh, I'm really Satan." And then it pleased him, because Satan believed in God, uh, and then he got thrown out of Paradise, obviously. And that myth is necessary in order to take in both aspects of your consciousness. Your consciousness and your transcendence are both taken in by the myth. And from then on, I saw him as Satan, this patient. And then we made great progress. Now, he took on, uh, Satan as his myth, uh, which it turned out to be. And he really believed in God, even though he was God's enemy. Uh, and this is the basis of "Paradise Lost". It's the basis of Dante. You never get to paradise except as you also realize that you have brought along hell as part of your own human personality. 

01:15:35
JEFFREY MISHLOVE You referred earlier to the, to the Faust myth. I gather it's important in the same manner. 

01:15:40
DR. ROLLO MAY In the same manner, exactly. That's, uh, it makes destruction and damnation as clear, uh, in the myth as it does salvation. 

01:15:55
JEFFREY MISHLOVE in other words, referring back to you and to me, or to our clients in the therapy situation, in order to ultimately find some inner redemption or, or some personal salvation we have to acknowledge the ways in which we have sold ourselves short. 

01:16:15
DR. ROLLO MAY Surely. We have sold ourselves short all the way along, and the hour before you die, before I die, we still will be selling ourselves partially short. Now, there will come also the experience of transcendence, but what these therapists don't understand is that transcendence is present in Beethoven and Mozart. Uh, they make transcendent music, but they don't leave themselves behind. And Wagner... 

01:16:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE in other words, transcendence and redemption aren't really quite the same. 

01:16:50
DR. ROLLO MAY No. Uh, redemption is a belief that, uh, after, that at the point of death, you achieve, uh, some transcendent experience, but you also receive transcendent insights all the way through life, but you don't receive them if you leave out your hell. And this is why I would speak very strongly against transpersonalism. You don't transcend the person. Your person is still there. My person is still there, but we find in this a great sense of essences, which we are as human beings. The transcendence, but also the hell that Dante has to go through. And none of us escape it. 

01:17:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And as a psychotherapist, in effect, you engage in a descent into hell with, with your clients. 

01:17:45
ROLLO MAY, PhD Existential Psychologist 

01:17:45
DR. ROLLO MAY By all means. Yes, I was talking earlier about the therapists who find all these new gimmicks. I think transpersonalism is a gimmick. And, I think it also has the same mistakes that I was describing then, that it leaves out the depth of the person, uh, that is the patient. And this depth will come by virtue of anger. It will come by virtue of, of dreams, some dreams will be quite destructive. And they often may be the most helpful dreams of all. And, uh, the essence of human existence, uh, is, uh, not to be left behind, but to be confronted directly, and then you can have, can discover the real challenge, uh, of human life. 

01:18:40
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Surely, for you or for any therapist to enter into that descent with a client, you have to have the, the authenticity to have confronted your own hell. 

01:18:55
DR. ROLLO MAY I think so. If you haven't confronted your own hell, uh, you are short-circuiting the process. This is why the therapist for Dante was Virgil, that and another person in Florence.

JEFFREY MISHLOVE The Roman poet. 

01:19:10
DR. ROLLO MAY Yeah, the Roman ooet. Uh, Virgil had already shown through his, and, and he had, uh, the greatness, uh, the damnation and the greatness of this tragedy of the Aeneid. And therefore, he could show Dante, to point out to Dante the, uh, characters in hell, and the meaning of each one of these steps toward purgatory. And he went with Dante, halfway through purgatory. I have written up, uh, the myth of the, of, uh, the Dante's experience and "The Divine Comedy" that will be part of my new book, and is beautiful example of Virgil as the therapist. How Dante then takes with him the knowledge, certainly of hell, and also purgatory. 

01:20:10
JEFFREY MISHLOVE It, it also, what, what you're saying reminds me of the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, with their emphasis on, on the realms of the demons, and on things such as meditating and cemeteries, and, uh, I have a Tibetan Thangka which shows disembodied figures , and blood and guts spilling out all over. There's this sense in, in their tradition that to achieve a true Buddhist realization, one has to really confront the impermanence of life. 

01:20:40
DR. ROLLO MAY Yes, the reason these Buddhists cults , uh, have grown with great rapidity here in California, and soon they die. One never hears of them again. Uh, the reason they grew so fast is that they, they are taken as showing, uh, this negative side of life. And then it's forgotten, and they have only joy. And it doesn't last. Uh, the cult lasts 10, 15 years, and then it's finished. And there's no more of, uh, this particular form of meditation around. Now, the Buddhists themselves, uh, would understand what I'm saying very clearly, because life is hard in India. And, the idea of, of, uh, transcendence, uh, is made quite concrete in that you can transcend yourself in, uh, meditation, uh, not because they got away from the hell, but rather because they temporarily transcend the experience of living in a country where life is very difficult. Now, here in California, life is not difficult at all. And this, uh, shows the mishandling, uh, of Buddhists teaching. It comes to this country and becomes only transpersonal, only lovely. Uh, and that's a very nice thing. It isn't psychotherapy, and it does not meet the realities of human excistence. 

01:22:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE But, I gather what you're suggesting is that even in a wonderful place to live like California, we are confronted when we look deeply with the same existential reality as in the slums of Bombay. 

01:22:35
ROLLO MAY, PhD Existential Psychologist 

01:22:35
DR. ROLLO MAY By all means. We have our despair here, uh, if we are aware of it. Uh, and certainly in this country, despair on Wall Street, that the thousands of California's watch with great care . Is the market going to go down? We have our anxiety, but these things can be covered up more easily in California. But, in the long run, uh, one never gets anyplace by covering them up. 

01:23:05
JEFFREY MISHLOVE we have only a minute or two left, but the descent into hell is part of the therapeutic process. One must wonder will it ever end? I mean, couldn't it be almost an endless spiral downward? There, is there a point at which one emerges? 

01:23:25
DR. ROLLO MAY Oh, by all means. That's the purpose of the, uh, of the transcendence. I believe firmly in transcendence, and I believe the transcendence has no meaning except as there is the despair underneath. And despair has no meaning except as the transcendence. 

01:23:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE In other words, as we look at the full human being, we always have transcendence present, and yet we never really escape damnation either. 

01:23:55
DR. ROLLO MAY That's right. Yes, you summed it up beautifully. That's the, that's the great joy in being a psychotherapist, because these things I can experience, not only in myself, but in my patients. And then it makes psychotherapy something that, uh, boredom is the farthest thing from our minds in psychotherapy, but rather the, the great surprise, the mystery of being a human being that is our goal. 

01:24:25
JEFFREY MISHLOVE We're all simultaneously blessed and damned. 

01:24:30
DR. ROLLO MAY That's right. You couldn't have summed it up better. 

01:24:30
JEFFREY MISHLOVE Well, I, I'm sort of astounded that we've arrived at, at this point. That's a profound insight that's going to, I'm sure, will occupy my mind now for, for some time. Rollo May, thank you so much for being with me. 

01:24:45
DR. ROLLO MAY No, it was a joy for me. 

01:24:45
JEFFREY MISHLOVE And thank you very much for being with us.
