MANIVONG J. RATTS Hi, my name's Dr. Manivong J. Ratts, and I am Associate Professor in the Department of Counseling and Sch-, School Psychology at Seattle University. Today, what you're gonna be doing is watching a video series titled "Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy." We're gonna be going over the major theoretical paradigms, if you will, or forces that have really shaped, uh, how counseling is practiced with clients. We're gonna look at the first force which is the psychoanalytic tradition, the second force which is also referred to as the cognitive/behavioral tradition in counseling and psychotherapy. Then we'll highlight and provide an overview of the third force in counseling which is the existential/humanistic perspective in counseling and psychology. Then we'll look at the fourth force in counseling which is referred to as the multicultural paradigm in the field. And then last but not least, we'll examine and look at social justice as the fifth force in counseling and psychotherapy. Within each of these particular theories or paradigms or forces, if you will, I'll be interviewing experts in the field. Each of these experts will be sharing and talking about their current research within that particular paradigm, as well as some of the major tenets of the particular force that, uh, they are specializing in in the particular field. So I'll be interviewing, uh, psychoanalytic, uh, uh, scholar. I'll be interviewing a CBT scholar, existential scholar, uh, multicultural-oriented scholar, and then last but not least, a social-justice-oriented scholar who've really helped shaped each of those particular forces and made them what they are today. Following each of those particular interviews, uh, what you'll see is a series of therapy sessions with the same clients. The client will be working with five different therapists. Each therapist will be operating from a particular tradition, paradigm, or force, if you will. The first therapist will be operating from a psychoanalytic tradition. The second therapist will be working from a CBT perspective, a cognitive/behavioral, uh, orientation. The third therapist will be operating from a existential/humanistic perspective in counseling. The fourth therapist will be working from a multicultural-oriented perspective. And then the last but not least, we have a demonstration of a therapist working from a social-justice-oriented perspective. My hope is that by watching each of these particular video, uh, or, or interviews, if you will, as well as each of these particular, uh, counseling sessions, it'll really highlight and provide you with some of the strengths and weaknesses of each particular, uh, counseling force that've really shaped how counseling is practiced to this day. Today, what you're gonna be doing is watching part of a larger video segment titled "Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy." And in particular for today, what you're gonna be doing is watching, uh, uh, me interview Dr. Mark B. Scholl who is an Associate Professor at Eastern Carolina University. Dr. Scholl is an expert in the existential/humanistic tradition in counseling and psychotherapy, and in this interview what we will be doing is highlighting some of the major historical, uh, events that, and, and figures that have shaped the existential movement and, and humanistic movement in counseling and psychotherapy. Dr. Scholl will also be talking about some of the major tenets of existentialism as well as humanistic, uh, uh, uh, schools of thought, uh, as well as talk about some of the major research that's happening in the field of existentialism and humanism in counseling and psychotherapy. Following the interview with Dr. Scholl, you'll have an opportunity to watch a live counseling session with Steven Scheutz who is a private practice therapist in Seattle, Washington. And he's gonna demonstrate how to operationalize existential tenets with a particular client. Again, this particular video series is part of a larger video series titled "Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy" where we compare and contrast the major forces in the field that've really shaped counseling, uh, as we know it today. The psychoanalytic tradition which is the first force in counseling, the second force is referred to as the cognitive/behavioral tradition, the third being the existential/humanistics tradition, the fourth, the multicultural counseling paradigm, and last but not least, social justice, the fifth force in counseling and psychotherapy.

3rd Force: The Existential/Humanistic Paradigm Interview Mark B. Scholl, Ph.D., Associate Professor, Eastern Carolina University 

00:04:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS Well, thank you, Dr. Scholl for taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me to talk about, uh, existential and humanistic counseling as the third wave or the third force in the counseling profession. I know you've been really active in sort of helping shape this particular, uh, uh, wave in, in the counseling field by being involved as the general editor, or the past editor of the journal Humanistic Counseling, Education and Development and also with your recent publication of the book, Humanistic Perspectives on Contemporary Counseling Issues, um, and also serving as president elect of the Association for Humanistic Counseling, uh, for the, 2012? 

00:05:25
MARK B. SCHOLL Yeah, that's right. 

00:05:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS Academic year. And so you've really been instrumental, uh, from what I can see in terms of helping to shape this particular movement, if you will, this third force in the field. I'm pretty excited about being able to interview you and really getting some insight in terms of what existential and humanistic counseling is really all about, uh, what does it look like, how do you operationalize this third force in, in the counseling field in practice with clients. I have a series of questions I wanted to, to begin to sort of start this, this interview, to sort of give us a understanding of this third wave, if you will, in the field of counseling and psychology. I think I'd like to start by just sort of asking you a little bit in terms of just if you can give us a little history about existential/humanistic counseling as a third force, sort of how did it evolve? 

00:06:20
MARK B. SCHOLL It goes back as, it goes back all the way to the beginnings of, of recorded time when people would ask questions such as what, what does life mean? What is the meaning of life, why are we here? You know, what is our significance? But in terms of, uh, a more formal, uh, definition, it began with, uh, Kierkegaard, uh, right after, uh, World War II, um, who wrote, uh, The Concept of Dread. And in that book, Kierkegaard is sort of, um, uh, rebelling against, uh, notions of people as being more mechanized, um, and saying that we need to take a more introspective view of humanity, a view that's more, uh, person-centered. And certainly, Kierkegaard informed, uh, Carl Rogers' person-centered counseling. And, uh, you could also see, uh, Carl Rogers' person-centered counseling as being a reaction to behaviorism which is, which is very, very mechanized and, um, uh, psychoanalysis which is pessimistic and, and certainly, uh, does not emphasize, by any means, uh, our, our freedom of choice and, and action. 

00:07:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS So it sounds like you're saying the humanistic, existential counseling perspective really takes a, more of a strength-based perspective, would you say? 

00:07:45
MARK B. SCHOLL Absolutely. It's much more optimistic, it's much more, uh, emphasis placed on human potential. But I think it's really, uh, important, uh, to draw a distinction between the American brand of humanistic psychology and the European roots. Whereas the, uh, the Europeans, uh, were not quite as pragmatic as Carl Rogers would be viewed. Whereas Carl Rogers was interested in fostering, um, human potential, um, the European tradition is more interested in looking at, um, crisis and really deep existential themes like death and meaning and, and so it can be perceived as darker in some respects, more of an emphasis on existential anxiety 'cuz you have this freedom of choice and this power to construct meaning and your own identity. It can be very, uh, overwhelming for the person. 

00:08:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS Who would you say, you mentioned Carl Rogers as one of the significant figures in terms of having to really put this movement on the map, if you will. Uh, are there other significant figures that, uh, you think have helped shape this particular movement in the field of counseling and psychology? 

00:09:10
MARK B. SCHOLL Well, you know, somebody who comes to mind immediately is, uh, is Viktor Frankl and Man's Search for Meaning and his experience of, of being in a concentration camp and, and having the courage to put a positive spin on that and say, um, "I'm responsible and I have the freedom to choose my response to this condition." And out of that came, uh, logotherapy and the idea that, uh, we can construct meaning in our lives. Uh, someone else that comes to mind is Abraham Maslow and, uh, his description of people who are self-actualizing. It's kind of like, uh, exemplars of, of what people are capable of becoming. 

00:10:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS What has your interest been in in this particular movement? How did you get involved, 'cuz I know you're pretty active in this particular field. 

00:10:05
MARK B. SCHOLL I started out, you know, in, in a masters program at the University of North Carolina Greensborough and I've always been, uh, a follower of Carl Rogers. I think a lot of us are. You know, we first get started, the microskills and the therapeutic attitudes, a lot of us just gravitate towards Carl Rogers. Um, and it's really, really interesting because, um, I, I guess it, it, it goes with my tendency to be very optimistic and forward-looking. And I developed a technique almost by happenstance, and it had to do with, uh, a lot of times in our field, we're really preoccupied with our resumes, or as we call them, our vitas, and I started to just kind of play around with my vita and say "What if I did this?" "What if in five years I've done things and this is who I would become?" and "What if in the next two years after that I did these things? This is what I would look like on paper." And I said, "Hey, this is kind of a technique. You know, this could be like a real, this could be like a real identity construction technique," and I created a cons-, a, uh, card sort where people look at descriptions, values, interests, uh, tasks, and they sort the cards into "like me" and "not like me" and they use those cards to inform a futuristic vision of themselves in, in the form of, of a resume. So they have this visual image of who they'd like to be in five to seven years. And afterwards, I said "Oh, that, that's really, in a way, very, very, uh, existentialist because you have the freedom to do that, you know, you have the freedom to be the author of your identity." And, and, and before I did that, that was a very, I mean, that was, that was kind of a novel concept for me before I came up with that idea. 

00:12:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah. Yeah, sounds like you've taken sort of a, I kind of look at existential and humanistic counseling and psychology as sort of abstract concepts and, and, and in a sense, talking about freedom, meaning, choice, uh, and, and you've sort of taken those concepts and have made it more practical in terms of how do you actually apply it in, in practice. 

00:12:40
MARK B. SCHOLL Yeah, to, uh, to concretize it in the form of a technique can be very, very elusive. 

00:12:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah. 

00:12:50
MARK B. SCHOLL Yeah, so. 

00:12:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah, yeah. 

00:12:50
MARK B. SCHOLL So that wasn't what I set out to do, but afterwards, I said "Well, this is what it looks like." 

00:12:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS It, it sort of evolved over time, it sounds like, from you as a graduate student learning about Rogerian techniques and principles to what it is right now. 

00:13:05
MARK B. SCHOLL Right. And, and Maslow's, uh, concept of self-actualization and this idea that you can do this card sort and you can pick and choose what you would include and would not include in your future self. And what I added to that was, uh, the idea of action steps. So they have to create a plan, a, uh, and action steps for how they plan on becoming that person they've depicted on paper. 

00:13:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS I'm interested in what you talked about in terms of action steps and, and what this new concept that you have or, or, or, uh, framework in terms of how do you implement existential humanistic counseling. Uh, it, it's interesting because when I read a lot about existentialism and humanistic psychology, one of the things that people talk about in terms of its limitations is that it's directionless, there's not really a technique. So I'm sort of interested in your take in terms of just how, uh, uh, you implement that or, or does that make sense? 

00:14:10
MARK B. SCHOLL It does. It makes sense, and I guess my response to that is when you read, for example, um, Kirk Schneider, um, Rollo May, they talk about these different dialectical tensions in existential therapy and one of them is, is freedom versus discipline. So, so the idea that you have the freedom through the card sort, and I include cards that are blank where you can just write anything you want on the card, there's nothing printed on it, to sort of represent freedom, but there's also gotta be discipline because they're, they're two sides of the same coin. And so, I think without a genuine commitment, and that takes courage, which is another, you know, key concept in existentialism. It takes courage, uh, you've, you've got to commit to these action steps and have some discipline too. So if you err on either side too much, you know, you ruin the whole thing. 

00:15:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah. So it sounds like you're saying there's a freedom within structure with this technique that you have. There, there's a structure, a framework in place, but there's a freedom to sort of implement that within certain boundaries that I think, as I hear about it, I think for the emerging counselor, uh, uh, uh, that would be really nice for them, I could see where it can sort of alleviate some of their concerns in terms of how do you actually implement existentialism and humanism in my work with clients in a way that's, makes sense? 

00:15:45
MARK B. SCHOLL Exactly, yeah. 

00:15:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS You talked about some of the major figures that have shaped existentialism and, and humanistic psychology. What would you say are some of the major or significant events, if you will, that you, you think sort of had an influence in, in shaping this particular perspective. 

00:16:05
MARK B. SCHOLL Yeah, I guess you could think of it in terms of events, or you could think of it in terms of trends that span long periods of history, but, um, World War II is one that, you know, really, really stands out because, um, so many things happened in World War II. I mentioned earlier, uh, Viktor Frankl's experience, uh, but there's the, the rise of Nazism and then a-, in the aftermath, people had to do a lot of soul-searching and think "How could this happen? How could people be, uh, so cruel and inhumane, and what does this say about, uh, the na-, about human nature? You know, what does this say about the tension between freedom and responsibility, and how can we underscore that, that people need to, um, take greater responsibility for their actions, but also to, to own their actions rather than sort of saying in the, in the context of a, of a chain of command, 'I was just following orders,' you know, to say 'I'm responsible for the choices that I make?'" So that one really stands out. Um, the atomic bomb, you know, the invention of the atomic bomb and how, uh, destructive that is and how reductionistic it is to say that we can all be reduced to atoms, you know, and elements. Uh, I think there's definitely, um, a railing against that tendency when you look at people like Carl Rogers and, and saying that, uh, we, we can't reduce people to atoms and electrons and, and neutrons; we have to look at their, at their values and their, and their sense of purpose, uh, and meaning in life and their power to create meaning for themselves. 

00:18:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS It sounds like what you're saying is oftentimes it's external events that cause us to sort of look inward and, and really, they're reflective in terms of where are we at, where do we wanna go, who am I, um, how do I make meaning of all this as, as a human being, as, as a person? Um, and, and so, when I think about that, I'm thinking, or I'm wondering, is there a level of maturity that's required to really be able to understand existentialism and humanistic psychology and to be able to implement it? 

00:18:35
MARK B. SCHOLL Yeah, I mean, what, what really comes to mind for me is, uh, is when a novelist I remember reading talking about the differences between, uh, the top ten books on the, on the American list and the European list and how you see a lot more of the classics on the top ten list in Europe than you do in America and the idea that we, we tend to read, uh, more for pure enjoyment whereas there's, I don't know if it's entirely fair, but the Europeans tend to read the classics and they tend to read weightier, you know, authors. Um, so in terms of maturity, and another thing that comes to mind is this concept of, uh, the wounded healer, so the idea that to be an effective existen-, existential therapist, uh, you have to have had the crisis yourself and to have resolved it in some way, but you are wounded in some way too as a result of that experience. So in order to have a credibility and to be effective, you have to have gone through some of these types of experiences that your, your client is currently facing. 

00:19:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS I, I'm curious about what you said 'cuz, or what you're saying, uh, 'cuz you're, and I can see what you're saying in terms of going through an experience like death or crisis can really help you develop a, a deeper sense of empathy. Um, my question is, for those counselors who've not gone through those experiences but really resonate with the existential humanistic perspective, um, what is your recommendation or, or, or what thoughts do you have about, uh, uh, folks who sort of fall in that category that, uh, wanna develop, you know, and operate from an existential humanistic perspective? Does that make sense? 

00:20:40
MARK B. SCHOLL Yeah, it makes a lot of sense and I think that a, a really good idea would be for, for that individual or those individuals to go, go into therapy with an existential therapist because then they can see what it's like from the perspective of the client, but also they could benefit from, uh, having an existential therapist guide them through the process and have an appreciation for how much courage it requires, you know, and what that crisis is like. And then they, they do in a real sense have credibility because they have gone through the process that they're now facilitating. 

00:21:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah, yeah. And I like that 'cuz it's, they can sort of see how it looks, see how it's being modeled, in a sense, and, and sort of figure out for themselves, does this fit me? 

00:21:35
MARK B. SCHOLL Yeah, exactly, and, and what's a crisis for this person versus this person, it, it depends on their subjective, uh, experience. So a crisis could be a career change for them. You know, it, it doesn't have to be, um, surviving cancer, something, you know, that serious. 

00:21:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah. In terms of key concepts within this particular wave in counseling and psychology, what would you say they are? You mentioned some of them. 

00:22:05
MARK B. SCHOLL Okay, so 

00:22:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS Meaning, choice, freedom. 

00:22:10
MARK B. SCHOLL Let's see. One that comes to mind is the idea that each of us has an inauthentic mode and an authentic mode, and you could also look at this as, um, you know, a tension between two polarities. So the idea is when you're in inauthentic mode, you're, you're conforming to conventional norms, and you might just do it automatically. So, you know, the existentialists are saying "You're not even really alive. You're just, you know, you're just an automaton going through the motions." And then when you're an, in authentic mode, well then you're exercising the courage and the freedom to express your true inner self, even if others disapprove or disagree, you know, you're, you're really having an authentic encounter with other people and being truly alive. 

00:23:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah, I hear what you're saying. I think the thing that comes up for me is that sounds difficult to, to be in that authentic mode, especially for new counselors or even graduate students who are trying to develop basic skills. 

00:23:20
MARK B. SCHOLL Right, it is, and I think what's helpful is, uh, what I read from, uh, Kirk Schneider is just the thought that it's not really all-or-none, you know, it's like, it's not like flipping on a switch, you know, and you're authentic, and you flip the, that's when you're inauthentic. It's, it's more like a continuum and it's where you fall along that continuum and the idea of progress would be, uh, becoming relatively more authentic more of the time. So it's, I think that makes it less daunting if you can visualize it that way. 

00:24:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah. Do you feel like also helping to sort of be present allows for that authenticity to come out in terms just focusing on the relationship, on what's going on now, being genuine? 

00:24:15
MARK B. SCHOLL Right, that whole concept of being, being open, you know, in the moment, to your own internal experience and not, uh, censoring. And you can see where, um, that whole notion of, uh, the counselor providing unconditional positive regard is so key in that respect because when you're with somebody that you feel is, is judging you and giving you conditional respect, you feel the need to censor and be more guarded, but you can, you can see the, the influence of Kierkegaard on, on Rogers in that respect. 

00:24:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah. What would you say, with respect to the client-counselor relationship, sort of how existential humanistic counselors and psychologists sort of view the therapeutic relationship between clients and counselor? 

00:25:10
MARK B. SCHOLL What that makes me think of is, uh, is Martin Buber, I and Thou, and the idea that the, the ideal being that two people in a relationship, the counselor and the client, are both being authentic together, um, and that is really what defines true meeting. For example, if I'm behaving in a way that I think you'd like for me to behave, um, we're not meeting at all, are we, because I'm just trying to, uh, to meet your expectations or vice versa. But when you're being yourself and I'm being myself, there's, there's an actual surface contact, and that's meeting, and that's the place where healing takes place. 

00:26:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah, yeah. How do you, I hear what you're saying and, and, and my question is how do you articulate that to clients, uh, especially clients who are either mandated or just don't wanna be there, uh, and, and, and, and they have their walls up? And it sounds like from this particular perspective, authenticity and being in the moment is so crucial to therapeutic movement. 

00:26:25
MARK B. SCHOLL Yeah, that, I mean, I can see where that would be extremely challenging, and I can just sort of go back to, uh, the facilitative conditions, Rogers core conditions, and providing that unconditional positive regard, uh, and I, and I also think of, uh, the recent advent of, uh, motivational interviewing and the idea, uh, that there are stages of change where some people are, are pre-contemplative and some people are contemplative and some people are planful. And I think those are an extent the counselor has to have some, um, understanding and empathy for where that client is, and that would be very, very helpful, but what you're saying is very challenging. 

00:27:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah. And it sounds like what you're saying is, is really therapists who operate from this particular framework ultimately need to meet clients where they're at. Um, if they're ready for change, operating from that level or stage, if you will; if they're not ready, versus, rather than sort of push them, sort of meet them where they're at and, and, and, and go with the resistance in a, in a way. 

00:27:45
MARK B. SCHOLL And the idea of, uh, the skill, the microskill of immediacy, you know, the idea that you can reflect, uh, the process as a part of the process. You can make, you can make comments about, uh, what you think might be going on with a client. It might even include maybe the client is, uh, is, uh, not feeling like cooperating or engaging might be a better way of looking at it because of past experiences with the legal system or authority figures, and through immediacy you can reflect that that's kind of influencing where they are with you right now. 

00:28:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS And I can see how that can help counselors not personalize things. 

00:28:35
MARK B. SCHOLL Exactly, yeah. 

00:28:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS It's not them, it's the client's history with, with the legal system, for example. 

00:28:40
MARK B. SCHOLL Exactly. Yeah. It's a great point. And that's something we do in roleplays in class, and it's, it's very, very helpful to do the roleplays because through the roleplays, the students become less and less defensive as they see it modeled by, by myself and classmates. 

00:29:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS How does the existential humanistic counseling perspective view client problems? How do they conceptualize client problems? For example, cognitive behaviorists will say it's due to irrational thinking or something related to cognition or behavior. That's why the client's stuck. 

00:29:20
MARK B. SCHOLL Well, it's interesting because, um, you know, it can be very, very different from other perspectives in that if you're quote "normal," that can be a bad sign because that means you're fitting in. And what the existentialists say was you don't wanna fit in because you're being inauthentic when you're fitting in, so that can be 

00:29:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS You're not being your true self. 

00:29:45
MARK B. SCHOLL That's right. So the problem could be, uh, it could be disguised in people who are fitting in very well, but inside, what, what's going on inside is, is what's really key. 

00:29:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah. Because that need to belong, that need to fit in, especially when you think about youth today and, and, and the cliques that are in schools and just wanting to fit in whether that's wearing the appropriate attire, uh, things of that nature. How do you help youth understand that inauthentic and unique and genuine and true to yourself is, is, is really important in terms of, you know, to develop a sense of, a healthy sense of self? 'Cuz that, there's a lot of pressure out there. 

00:30:25
MARK B. SCHOLL I think it's easier when you work with the person, uh, if you have the opportunity, to work with the person one-on-one and explore their values, do, do values clarification and so forth so they can understand themselves when they're alone. Um, that can be very helpful. Um, and, and I think that is necessary, uh, for respect for diversity, you know, diverse personalities, uh, diverse values, um, and if you have that, you can, you can also explore how fitting in with this group, one, it might not be the right group. You might be trying to fit in with the wrong clique. Of course, ideally, you're not trying to fit in with a clique because that's so stereotyped, uh, but the idea is to try to figure out who you really are and to frame it as a problem of constriction as opposed to expansion. So you are this person and you're being constricted so that you'll fit in with this clique, but if we could take you outside of that context or you could develop the courage and act, you can expand and be your true self. 

00:31:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS And, and become self-actualized, in a way. 

00:31:40
MARK B. SCHOLL Yeah, absolutely. 

00:31:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah, yeah. It sounds like it, it's really a process, uh, and, and, and it can take time, uh, when working with clients. How does the existential humanistic perspective sort of take that into consideration when you think about managed care industries and, and, and how therapy has become really in a package or, or, or limited, in a sense? 

00:32:10
MARK B. SCHOLL That's a real serious concern because of the, of the medical model, this is, this is not going to be, uh, the first choice in terms of cost effectiveness or efficiency, um, or third-party payments and so forth. But I think one bright side is that this is such a broad perspective that you can use a lot of different techniques in the name of existentialism. For example, if you were trying to help somebody expand, well, you could use systematic desensitization, you know, but in your, in your mind, you're conceptualizing it from an existential framework, but in terms of justifying it to the, to the providers, you know, the insurance company, well, you're using systematic desensitization. So you can, you can pay for it, you can, you can justify it. 

00:33:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay, okay. So it has a pragmatic sense to it. 

00:33:05
MARK B. SCHOLL It does. It does. You just have to be able to, and I think that that's kind of a, of a misunderstanding is that existential humanistics are very eclectic and they will, they will borrow from here and there to meet the client's needs, you know, within it because it is such, such an all-encompassing framework, yeah. 

00:33:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah, in one sense, it, it, it, I think one of the advantages to being able to borrow and be eclectic, if you will, is you can sort of have different perspectives and tools, uh, uh, to sort of work with clients. I wonder if you see as one of the disadvantages of being eclectic is, is you can have too many? Does that make sense? Where it's hard to be really in depth? 

00:34:00
MARK B. SCHOLL I don't, I don't see it that way. You know, I just, I see it as a, as a serious challenge 'cuz I have that example of systematic desensitization, but you, I would say the majority of the concerns of clients, um, are existential and they're not easily defined from a behavioral perspective, and that's a real problem with our, you know, with our profession. Uh, one answer to that is that our profession is coming more and more to embrace experiential forms of counseling and that is, is very compatible with existential humanism. 

00:34:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS And how do you quantify that in, in, in the world we live in now where accountability's so important? 

00:34:55
MARK B. SCHOLL I, I think that, I don't really have an answer for that. I think that is, is a legitimate, uh, question and problem for this perspective. Yeah. 

00:35:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay, okay. 

00:35:05
MARK B. SCHOLL With the medical model, you're definitely at a disadvantage. 

00:35:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah. In terms of the role of the therapist or the counselor or the psychologist, how does the existential humanistic perspective view the therapist role? 

00:35:20
MARK B. SCHOLL It, it's not that different from what you would see with, uh, Carl Rogers working. Um, I mentioned earlier the idea of, uh, you know, the wounded healer, uh, that's an example. Another, uh, term that's used is, uh, uh, the wise teacher, uh, or guide, but humble, but the person's humble because how can you purport to be an expert on life experience? You know, it's, it's the idea that you're a respectful guide and, and you're encouraging people, uh, and supporting them in making courageous choices. So it's not, it's really not that different from what you would see with, with Carl Rogers. 

00:36:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS So some, I mean, you use the terms "wounded healer," "guide," uh, and so it sounds like what you're saying is a therapist who operates from this paradigm is really a facilitator of, of the process, uh, versus always the expert that, that, that leads all the time or, or views themselves as, as all-knowing, if you will. 

00:36:35
MARK B. SCHOLL Right. And the idea is that each one of us has, uh, within us, uh, the strength, uh, to be self-healing. As, as the, um, as the term "wounded healer" indicates, the person who was wounded somehow found a way to heal; so can the client. Yeah. And you're, and you're, as the counselor, you're the catalyst for that process. 

00:37:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS And so you're sort of the tool to sort of help that change come to place, or to fruition, if you will. 

00:37:10
MARK B. SCHOLL Yeah, like the, you provide, uh, the relationship and the companionship, in a, in a sense, so the person isn't all alone, struggling with their, with their concerns, yeah. 

00:37:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS What do you see as some of the strengths of this particular approach to therapy? 

00:37:30
MARK B. SCHOLL Well, for me personally, um, I like the idea of these, uh, dialectical tensions. Um, I have studied a lot of philosophy along with psychology, and I, and I see in-, inherent truths in this perspective. I like the idea of emphasizing, uh, that people have the freedom. I see it as, uh, as very empowering. Uh, that's definitely a strength. Uh, I like the emphasis on responsibility. So, um, it's, it's difficult, though, because for some people, they would like a more circumscribed, concrete approach to working on a problem. 

00:38:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS Dr. Scholl, you've spoken about some of the strengths of the existential humanistic perspective in counseling and psychology; I'm wondering if you can talk about what you view as its limitations or what others may view as the limitations of this particular perspective. 

00:38:30
MARK B. SCHOLL I mentioned before, it's the idea that everybody doesn't embrace this sort of expansive, philosophical attitude. Some people want to be very pragmatic and concrete and just focus on just how do I fix this problem and would really welcome a behavioral approach. And, and that's coming from the client's preferences. So I think sometimes you really have to think, it's imperative and it's also one of the fundamental tenets of humanism is individualism, so you really have to think about is this really a good match for this particular client? It may, may be quite a poor match for some clients who are more inclined to think in terms of a reductionistic approach. 

00:39:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah. So it's not necessarily an approach that would work with all clients in all situations. Sounds like what you're saying. 

00:39:35
MARK B. SCHOLL No. I think, I think, I think with all these approaches, you know, that you use, it, you really have to think about the, the match and the fit with the client you're working with. But I do think that, you know, introspection is, is important and self-awareness, increased self-awareness as key fundamental principals is something that all clients can benefit from. 

00:40:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah. And it sounds like having that dialogue with clients in terms of is this gonna be a fit, is this gonna be a match, uh, this journey we're about to embark is, is really critical, would you say? 

00:40:10
MARK B. SCHOLL Having that discussion and, and, and I think of it in terms of structuring where you talk with the client about the process of counseling, but the importance of checking with the client and, and seeing what they think counseling is like and what their expectations are too because this really isn't a time-efficient process often. You know, it's something that can be long-term. 

00:40:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah. Making sure clients are committed and are gonna make it a priority, it, it sounds like is really important, to really be able to benefit from this particular paradigm in, in counseling, it sounds. 

00:40:50
MARK B. SCHOLL Yeah, absolutely. I talked earlier about the constructivist resume, and I wanna talk a little bit about, uh, the, the idea of multiculturalism. You know, so for example, with the, with the constructivist resume, you have the card sort, and some of those cards are values and you have to think well, where do those values come from? And when I look at those values, I have to say they come from kind of a Western perspective, and they come from, um, American, uh, products such as Super's Values Scale. And so they might not be multiculturally responsive to the extent that they could be. Improvements could be made, but at the same time, you have to, you have to think in terms of, I mean, going right back to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, if, if a client is dealing with, um, basic philological needs and you're counseling them, you have to be considerate of that and accommodate that need. It's not the time for, um, dealing with, uh, existential themes in their life, necessarily; it's more about food, clothing, shelter. They don't need the ideal job, they need a source of income. Yeah. 

00:42:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS It's really about being able to meet clients where they're at, kind of what you talked about earlier, being able to accurately assess clients in terms of where they're at and, and what their needs are. You know, one of the things you talked about was sort of multiculturalism and, and as you look at the field of counseling and psychology, the clients that we're serving is, are a lot more diverse than ever before. How does the existential humanistic perspective respond to the changing demographics of, if you will, of our clientele? 

00:42:45
MARK B. SCHOLL That's a very good question. I, I think that is a question that is neglected, but I, but I will say this, that existentialism is enhanced by the fact that we are a more globalized society because through the media, you know, through the internet, uh, people see that there's, there's no one truth, there's no one reality, that there are different cultures with different realities and so that brings home the point I can't adopt somebody else's reality when there are so many realities that already exist, um, I'm responsible for constructing a meaningful reality for myself. But at the same time, an increased respect for the realities of, of different people. 

00:43:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay. 

00:43:45
MARK B. SCHOLL I don't know if that, if that quite got, uh, to your question. 

00:43:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS It, it does in the sense of, it sounds like what you're saying is, is this particular mode of operation, if you will, really respects people in terms of their world views and that there's, there's multiple truths, not necessarily one truth. 

00:44:00
MARK B. SCHOLL So that's a real sense in which it's compatible with multiculturalism. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. 

00:44:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS Dr. Scholl, you've talked a lot about where the field's been and where it's at in terms of its current state; where do you see it going, the existential and humanistic perspective in counseling and psychology? 

00:44:20
MARK B. SCHOLL I think that there's, uh, a proliferation of techniques that are facilitating this process of constructing your future identity and, and the very concept, uh, Peavey's sociodynamic theory comes to mind, the idea that by the choices we make and the actions that we perform, we are constructing our identities, our very identities, and we can be even more intentional about that and even more forward-thinking, and I think we'll see more and more techniques along those lines. 

00:45:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay. 

00:45:05
MARK B. SCHOLL Another thing is, um, therapies are becoming more and more individualized, so they're becoming, I think, I see it as kind of a, a backlash against these, uh, behavioral protocols. For example, how you would deal with cigarette smoking. Um, there's an increasing number of approaches that emphasize using the individual's growth edges, this concept of "growth edges," to construct a very unique approach to working with them and facilitating what they've defined as, as meaningful growth edges. 

00:45:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS And for those viewers who are wanting to learn more about the existential and humanistic perspective in counseling and psychology, um, what recommendations would you have for them in terms of how they might themselves become more immersed in this movement? 

00:46:05
MARK B. SCHOLL Well, there's, there's a couple of texts. There's, uh, there's Corsini's, uh, Current Psychotherapy, and, uh, Current Psychotherapies, and then there's, um, Essential Psychotherapies, and Kirk Schneider has chapters in both of those books that are very, very good. Um, and going, going back and reading some of the original writings of Heidegger and Kierkegaard, um, Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning. Uh, there's, there's so many rich sources in philosophy. Yeah, it's just, it's hard to single out some as the ones that you, you must read, but, yeah. 

00:46:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS But some good recommendations, and it sounds like what you're really saying is for folks to really be grounded in this particular perspective, they really need to read the classics, the original works, uh, understand how it evolved, to, to understand how this perspective evolved to its present state. 

00:47:10
MARK B. SCHOLL And that, and that again goes along with, uh, if you're really interested in this perspective or this approach to counseling, it, it probably says something about, about your personality and your preferences for reading the classics and reading philosophy. 

00:47:30
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah. So it takes a certain type of person. 

00:47:30
MARK B. SCHOLL Yeah. Yeah. 

00:47:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS Makes sense. 

00:47:35
MARK B. SCHOLL And Carl Rogers is very philosophical. Books by, books by Carl, Carl Rogers are very good to read as well. 

00:47:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS Well, I just wanna thank you for your time. I know I learned a lot about existentialism and humanistic counseling and psychology and how this third wave in the field has really, uh, come to fruition as, and has influenced the counseling profession. So I just wanna thank you for giving your time to, to us, to me, in terms of just, uh, being able to articulate what your perspective is on this particular movement in the field. 

00:48:10
MARK B. SCHOLL Thanks a lot. I've enjoyed it. 

00:48:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS Thank you.

Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy 

00:49:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS Today, what you're gonna be doing is watching part of a larger video segment titled "Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy," and in particular for today, what you're going to be doing is watching, uh, uh, me interview Dr. Mark B. Scholl, who is an associate professor at Eastern Carolina University. Dr. Scholl is an expert in the existential humanistic tradition in counseling and psychotherapy. And in this interview what we will be doing is highlighting some of the major historical, uh, events that, and, and figures that have shaped the existential movement and, and humanistic movement in counseling and psychotherapy. Dr. Scholl will also be talking about some of the major tenets of existentialism as well as humanistic, uh, uh, uh, schools of thought, uh, as well as talk about some of the major research that's happening in the field of existentialism and humanism in counseling and psychotherapy. Following the interview with Dr. Scholl, you'll have an opportunity to watch a live counseling session with Steven Scheutz who is a private practice therapist in Seattle, Washington. And he's gonna demonstrate how to operationalize existential tenets with a particular client. Again, this particular video series is part of a larger video series titled "Five Forces of Counseling and Psychotherapy" where we compare and contrast the major forces in the field that've really shaped counseling, uh, as we know it today. The psychoanalytic tradition which is the first force in counseling, the second force is referred to as the cognitive/behavioral tradition, the third being the existential/humanistics tradition, the fourth, the multicultural counseling paradigm, and last but not least, social justice, the fifth force in counseling and psychotherapy.

Steven Scheutz, MS, LMHC, LMFT, Private Practice Therapist 

00:51:05
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Shall we just jump in? 

00:51:05
ANNIE Okay, uh, but if something, if I have questions later, I can ask you? 

00:51:10
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Please. Absolutely, yeah. So how can I be helpful? 

00:51:15
ANNIE Oh, well, um, I'm thinking of dropping out of my program, um, of my school, mostly because, you know, well, I'm not, I'm not doing so well, um, and I partly think it's really, that I need to go anyway, anymore anyway. Um, you know, I started, I started going to college because I was hoping to get a degree to help, to help get a job, to help out at home, um, but, you know, we were struggling for a while, um, but now it's, you know, he's doing better, um, and the money isn't as tight anymore. Um, so, you know, he's thinking maybe it's, if I don't need it, then, you know, why do I go? 

00:52:05
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Okay. So that's what he's thinking; what are you thinking? 

00:52:10
ANNIE I will, I, I can see his point, you know, and it's not, I don't, I mean, if I don't need school, you know, why go? It's, I can stay home and, you know, maybe we can have kids soon and be home and take care of the kids. And I was, I mean, I'm not like the A-student anyway, you know, so it's not gonna, not gonna miss me much, you know, in class anyway. So I think it makes, it makes sense. 

00:52:40
STEVEN SCHEUTZ It sounds like this is a, a pretty tough decision that, that you're, that you're having to make. Um, what do you think you need in order to make this decision? 

00:52:50
ANNIE I, I don't know. I mean, I mean, I wanna do what's best for the family. 

00:53:00
STEVEN SCHEUTZ And who gets to decide that? 

00:53:00
ANNIE I guess, I guess him, most of the time. 

00:53:05
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Is that an agreement that the two of you have or just something that's happened that way? 

00:53:15
ANNIE I guess it's just happened that way, but he makes a lot of sense, you know, and when I, I mean, I, I, when I have counterarguments, it just doesn't seem, uh, backup, or, it just doesn't seem to make sense compared to his argument, you know, so. 

00:53:35
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Tell me more about that. 

00:53:40
ANNIE I don't know, it just, I'm not a quick thinker, you know, and he's, he's, he's very, um, when we argue, he's very, you know, he's very verbal, um, so when we argue, especially when in the heat of the moment, he makes so much sense and, and I can't think and I can't defend my argument, um, and it's, it's, I just sort of give up anyway, you know, so it's hard. 

00:54:05
STEVEN SCHEUTZ So it sounds like you're having trouble with the process, with the way that you're, that decisions are being made. You're quite emotional about this. 

00:54:15
ANNIE Yeah. And it's a bit frustrating. 

00:54:20
[sil.] 

00:54:25
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Tell me more about what you're feeling, about why this is so frustrating. 

00:54:35
ANNIE I kinda wanna do stay in school. 

00:54:40
STEVEN SCHEUTZ So what would need to happen in order for that to happen? 

00:54:50
ANNIE I don't know. 

00:54:55
STEVEN SCHEUTZ It seems like there's a really big conflict here for you. 

00:55:05
ANNIE Yeah. 

00:55:05
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Just seems like there's a lot of meaning around this for you. 

00:55:05
ANNIE Around, which one? 

00:55:10
STEVEN SCHEUTZ This, this conflict, this decision whether, you know, whether or not to please him or to stay in school. 

00:55:15
ANNIE I, I kinda wanna do both. I, you know, but I can't have both, so. I mean, and I can't, it's not like we can afford it, and if I do go, it's mostly him paying it, you know, 'cuz I'm, 'cuz, you know, he's the breadwinner. It's not really my choice, is it? 

00:55:45
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Well, let's explore that a little. Um, I tend to think that, that we have a lot, a lot more choices and freedoms than we sometimes acknowledge. Sometimes, um, exercising those freedoms though, um, require a decision and sometimes some discomfort around that decision. And there's often very real barriers to making those decisions, as well. It sounds like one of the barriers here is, for you, is your, um, desire to do what he wants. I'm curious in that process where you fit? Where do you get to do what you want? 

00:56:40
ANNIE But it's not really fair to him, you know, because what I want now is different than what we wanted before. So it's, it's, it's unfair because I've, I guess, what I want's changed, you know, and it's, yeah, it's unfair 'cuz it's not like, it's not, he's not changed, he hasn't changed, I have. And it's, it's unfair because maybe he didn't bargain for this when we got, you know, into the relationship. So I think, I think I'm kind of being unfair. 

00:57:25
STEVEN SCHEUTZ I'm having a little bit of a strong reaction to that, and is it okay if I, if I, can we play with this for just a little bit, this idea of unfair? Have you ever changed your mind? 

00:57:35
ANNIE Yeah. 

00:57:35
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Has he ever changed his mind? When people change their mind about something, is that, at its core, really unfair? 

00:57:45
ANNIE I mean, if it's small, it, you know, like for dinner, then no. But this is like a major decision, you know, that affects both of us. 

00:57:55
STEVEN SCHEUTZ It's a major decision, and it seems like in many ways it actually affects you more than him. I'm wondering if part of your frustration around this is about really choosing to make a choice for you and having to deal with the difficult consequences of that, regardless of what you choose. Because it seems like regardless of what you choose, this actually affects you much more than him. And sometimes when we're faced with those decisions, um, the most difficult part about that is actually the responsibility of making those decisions. 

00:58:50
ANNIE I don't wanna make him unhappy. 

00:58:55
STEVEN SCHEUTZ What if it makes you unhappy? 

00:58:55
ANNIE I'm the type of person that can go with the flow, you know, and make the best of both situations, any situation. So I, you know, I can, I'll be okay. 

00:59:05
STEVEN SCHEUTZ How unhappy will this really make him? 

00:59:15
ANNIE Well, he doesn't, he doesn't like that I, you know, I'm not in the home when he calls. Or sometimes, you know, I'm like, I could be out with the classmates after class and so he, he doesn't like that, and so he does get kind of frustrated, um, with that. You know, and, and sometimes, yeah, I come home and listen to the things I've, you know, learned in school, and it's like he can't, you know, really relate to that, so I think that kind of frustrates him too, you know? And so I think, yeah, it's kind of, you know, it's not, yeah, he's unhappy too. 

00:59:55
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Is that a permanent situation or is that just temporary while you're in school? 

01:00:00
ANNIE Well, I don't know. But he, you know, he's paying for it. It's not like it's my own money that, you know, that I can do what I want. It's his money. You know, I like, I just, I already owe him so much, I feel like I can't, I don't know, I just, I just, I don't know. So. 

01:00:30
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Can we try something? I'm not sure if it'll work, but let's give it a try. Um, it's a little, a little out there. Let's, um, let's try on two different hats, okay? Let's, let's try on the hat that you make a series of decisions that, um, end up in you not continuing school, and you're not in school anymore, and it's five years from now. Um, tell me about the decisions you're proud of, tell me about the decisions you regret. 

01:01:10
ANNIE Well, it'd be great 'cuz, you know, we'd be having a family. 

01:01:15
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Okay. 

01:01:15
ANNIE And, you know, hopefully, you know, three, um, maybe not in five years, but, you know, on our way towards three. Um, you know, and, you know, it'd be really nice in the home. You know, I'd take care of the kids and, and he'd go to work. And we both go on vacations in the summer. And so I think I'd be really proud of that, of having that 

01:01:45
STEVEN SCHEUTZ A home, okay, okay. How does that relate to school? How, how would that be different, whether or not you went to school? 

01:01:55
ANNIE I guess it really wouldn't be different. That's why I might not wanna got to school then. You know, I don't need a school to be a mom. I don't need a degree to be a mom, I need to be a wife. 

01:02:05
STEVEN SCHEUTZ I think the key here is really what you want. And I'm hearing, and I'm seeing, a lot of sadness in your face around this, and I'm also seeing you privileging what he wants well above what you want. I mean, and I'm really curious about that. Yes, I, I, I hear your statement, "it's his money." Um, and I guess that brings up lots of questions for me around the type of relationship you have, um, about really, um, I'm curious if he's happy when you're happy or not. I'm curious to what extent he knows that you really, really want this, even though it sounds like he's a little intimidated by this. 

01:02:50
ANNIE I think he knows I really like going to school 'cuz I come home and talk about it so much. You know, but we've gotten into fights over this, you know, and fights over, you know, how, my classmate I hang out with after school, you know? And it's just, I just wanna keep peace in the house. I don't really wanna fight anymore. 

01:03:15
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Tell me more about your fights. 

01:03:20
ANNIE I don't know, it's just, it's usually over, you know, who I'm out with, if he can't reach me. You know, 'cuz before school, I didn't really have many friends, you know, um, but, you know, in, after, in school after class, you know, especially my friend Lauren, you know, we go out, you know, get coffee and talk about class, and, um, yeah, it's really fun hanging with her. Um, and, you know, I don't think he likes Lauren. I can see why. She's, she's kind of a, she's really opinionated. Um, yeah, so, and he gets, and I, yeah, and he gets angry when I stay out too late. 

01:04:05
[sil.] 

01:04:10
ANNIE And, you know, actually, Lauren was the one who told me to come to see you because, um, I haven't been going to class for the last, you know, three or four weeks because I'm thinking, you know, what's the point anyway? Um, and then, um, she kind of made me come here which made me really angry because, you know, she's making me do something I don't really wanna do. 

01:04:40
STEVEN SCHEUTZ But you came anyway. 

01:04:40
ANNIE Well, yeah. 

01:04:40
STEVEN SCHEUTZ And was to please Lauren? 

01:04:40
ANNIE Kind of. Just to, to not argue with her, you know, 'cuz, um, she called me and it's like, I was home, like, you know, all day for those three weeks and we hadn't been in contact with her and she just came by and kept nagging me, so. 

01:05:00
STEVEN SCHEUTZ So there's two different things I wanna, I wanna explore with you. One is this theme of you pleasing other people instead of you. And I'm really curious about that. Um, and the other thing is really along the same lines, you know, I don't know much about your background or your beliefs or your culture, what's important to you, um, but it sounds like, in many ways, you, you definitely privilege what, um, what your partner feels or wants over what you want, and I'm, I'm really curious about that. Is that a value for you, is it something that you're aware of, that you deliberately think about, or is just something that happens? 

01:05:50
ANNIE I guess, I guess both. You know, I don't, I don't like conflict and I, I like to keep the peace, you know, and it's, I don't like conflict. It really, it hurts. So it's just a lot easier, you know, to just go along with things, you know, and, um, I don't, I don't really have any, it's not like that's gonna kill someone, you know? Then I'd be against that, but to go along with what they wanna do, sometimes it's no big deal. You know, since, well, and my family is, we're Chinese, so, you know, so, um, yeah, we don't, you know, we like harmony and, you know, um, keeping the peace, so. 

01:06:35
STEVEN SCHEUTZ So, um, you like peace, and when you said you like peace, tears came to your eyes. 

01:06:40
ANNIE Really? 

01:06:45
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Yeah. 

01:06:45
ANNIE Oh, okay. Yeah, I just 

01:06:50
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Is it possible to have peace and to also have what you want? 

01:07:00
ANNIE Sometimes no. 

01:07:05
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Tell me more about that. 

01:07:10
[sil.] 

01:07:15
ANNIE In terms of? 

01:07:20
STEVEN SCHEUTZ When is, when is a time when you can't have what you want? 

01:07:20
ANNIE When I can or can't? 

01:07:25
STEVEN SCHEUTZ When you can't. Yeah. 

01:07:30
ANNIE Right now. You know, I can't, I, I kinda just wanna be left alone, sort of. With Lauren, I just wanna be left alone and, with Ryan, I just wanna be left alone too. Kind of just be left alone for a while. I don't know. 

01:07:50
STEVEN SCHEUTZ It sounds like these people really care about you. Um, but you tend to listen to what they want for you instead of what you want for you. Is that what happens? Um, what would it be like if you did what you want for you? Remember when I talked about the questions that, there, there were two questions? There was one, okay, what if you don't go to school? I'm curious about, and you've said one of the things you want for you is to go back to school. Tell me about those decisions of you going back to school and you doing what you want for you. What would happen with your relationships, do you think, if you did what you want to do for you? 

01:08:45
ANNIE I think if I, it'd be great to go to school, I mean, I like sitting in the classes and like, talking about these things that never really talked about and never really learned in high school, you know, and so I don't know where to go with this degree. 

01:09:00
STEVEN SCHEUTZ You know, you have a lot of joy in your face when you talk  about learning. 

01:09:05
ANNIE Yeah. And it really is how much fun it can be. Um, it's a lot of fun. Um, but I don't know what to do with a degree anyway, right? You can't really get, do much with a BA. So, but for now, it's really, actually really fun, you know, talking about ideas and 

01:09:25
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Are you allowed to have fun in life? 

01:09:25
ANNIE Yeah, but, yeah, but it's, I can have fun in different ways too. 

01:09:35
STEVEN SCHEUTZ But it sounds like you really want to have fun in this way and that's really important to you. Your whole face lights up. I wonder if your partner really understands that, how much joy this gives you. 

01:09:50
ANNIE I don't think it matters. I don't think it matters anyway, so. It's just, yeah. 

01:10:00
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Help me understand "it doesn't matter." 

01:10:05
ANNIE I don't know, it's, it's, well, to be honest, it's mostly always what, usually what he wants, you know? 'Cuz I'm pretty easygoing so it's usually, you know, whatever he wants to do, it's fine with me. Um, you know, where we wanted to live and 

01:10:20
STEVEN SCHEUTZ So I have to tell you, I'm a little, and this is one of those parts where I, one of those times where I, I need to juggle sort of, um, your values and beliefs, and part of that might be about, you know, I need to do what my partner says, the man says, and my beliefs which are a little bit more feminist-oriented which is really about, um, everyone should have their own voice and everyone should have a degree of freedom and everyone, to some extent, while there's restrictions, everyone should be able to do things in life that make them happy. So you gonna help, have to help me here because, because my thinking is really, um, why does he get to say what's right for you? But that might be different for what you really want and what is right for you. So can you help me build a bridge between that and understand, um, how important is it really that he gets his way to you? Versus you having a voice and you getting to do something that's really important and choosing your own path, which can be with him, but it's really your path. We're talking about you and you being in school and something that's clearly very important to you. 

01:11:50
ANNIE What, it's just, I'm, I'm more flexible. You know, I'm more, I'm more flexible. 

01:11:55
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Should you be flexible? Flexible sometimes means I'm, I don't choose, I, I don't actually make decisions. Other people make them for me. 

01:12:10
ANNIE Well, sometimes it's easier. 

01:12:10
STEVEN SCHEUTZ It's easier, but you end up not living the life that you choose. You end up living a life that someone else chooses for you. And that, that's a choice in itself, if that is a choice that you want. That's, that's a valid choice. But part of what might be helpful for you to understand is that that's a terrible, awful, but wonderful choice. 

01:12:40
ANNIE Wouldn't this end the relationship? I don't want it to end. 

01:12:45
STEVEN SCHEUTZ And there are consequences to choices. I don't know, because I've never met your partner, I, I have, I, um, I don't know how realistic that is that it will actually end. I see the emotion and the fear on your face about that, but I'm also hearing from you that you don't, maybe  you, you haven't had a history of actually using your voice and exercising choice and saying "I want this." So I, you, you might have to help me understand what the history is for you actually saying in your life "I want this." 

01:13:30
ANNIE I mean, I guess, I guess, I guess I never really had to make a decision. Making decisions are hard, you know, making choices are hard. 

01:13:40
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Absolutely, I'm right there with you. 

01:13:40
ANNIE I, I never really had to make a decision because it just sort of, I don't always know what's expected of me, right? So it wasn't like it was, it wasn't like it was, you know, a big, life-altering decision to go to college, go to high school, you know, get married or, you know, be in a relationship. It was just, it just sort of happened. That's what, that's what's supposed to happen. 

01:14:10
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Tell me about "supposed to." What is "supposed to?" 

01:14:15
ANNIE Well, that's what you're supposed to do. 

01:14:20
STEVEN SCHEUTZ According to who? 

01:14:25
ANNIE People that lived before you. 

01:14:25
STEVEN SCHEUTZ And why do they get to make the rules for you? 

01:14:30
ANNIE It's just the way things are. 

01:14:30
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Is it ever different? 

01:14:35
ANNIE I guess. But I don't know, I don't 

01:14:40
STEVEN SCHEUTZ What if they hadn't lived before you and they hadn't made the "supposed to" and you got to make up all your own rules and you got to live the life completely that you wanted to do, that you wanted to live, what life would you live, what would you do, what would you choose? 

01:15:00
ANNIE I would've, I did what I wanted to do, but then everyone's just left and there's no supporting. 

01:15:10
[sil.] 

01:15:15
STEVEN SCHEUTZ How likely is it that that will happen? 

01:15:15
ANNIE I think it's really likely. 

01:15:25
[sil.] 

01:15:30
ANNIE I don't know, I just, I don't wanna be alone. And then I think, you know, if this does end up ruining our relationship, everyone's gonna blame me. 

01:15:50
STEVEN SCHEUTZ It sounds like he exerts an incredible amount of power over you. And I, and I have to be honest with you, I'm a little concerned about your safety. 

01:16:05
ANNIE What do you mean? 

01:16:10
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Well, for anyone who holds that much power, "If you don't do exactly what I want you to do, I'm going to leave you," um, it doesn't sound like there's much space for your needs and your wants and you, who you are, in this relationship. 

01:16:35
[sil.] 

01:16:40
ANNIE Is that how you describe safety? 

01:16:40
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Emotional safety, yeah. Emotional safety is about being able to have ideas and have them heard, and sometimes disagreed with, but have them be respected. 

01:17:00
ANNIE I guess. 

01:17:05
STEVEN SCHEUTZ What does safety mean to you? 

01:17:10
ANNIE Am I not being provided for, taken care of. 

01:17:10
STEVEN SCHEUTZ That makes sense. And so you're worried that if you lose that, you won't have anything. 

01:17:20
[sil.] 

01:17:25
ANNIE But it, it's, you know, when you talk about safety, it's, it, it sounds, it kind of sounds like you were saying he's abusive. And he's never, he's never hit me before. He's never hit me. 

01:17:40
STEVEN SCHEUTZ I think labels are really difficult, and I'm not placing a label on him. I'm not saying he's necessarily being abusive, um, but sometimes people act in ways that don't, um, provide for safety. There are other ways of restricting people and their freedoms and their choices, um, besides hitting. And one is when you basically say "It's my way. You don't get to have a way." And whenever that happens, I, I like to question that a little bit. I like to question people's assumptions around that. I like to question how much of that, um, is really working for you, is really working for him? Because what he misses out on is being with a person that gets to have free will to make her own decisions and become whoever she wants to be which is kind of a cool thing to be with someone like that versus "You have to do this." 

01:18:50
ANNIE And I'm gonna say, I was gonna say that it's also about compromise, but then I kinda know what you're gonna say with that. 

01:19:00
STEVEN SCHEUTZ What am I gonna say? 

01:19:00
ANNIE You're gonna say, "But you're the one that's compromising." 

01:19:05
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Is that how you feel? 

01:19:05
ANNIE I'm sorry? 

01:19:05
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Is that how you feel? 

01:19:10
ANNIE I guess. But it's okay, you know, because, I, I'm flexible, you know, I, I'm flexible. He, he's not as flexible. He's 

01:19:20
STEVEN SCHEUTZ So I'm gonna challenge that. You might be flexible, but your emotions are telling me you're not so flexible and that there's some real pain here for you. Yes, you might be able to manage that pain and you might be able to, to deal with it, but it's real pain which tells me you're not so flexible. You're like the rest of us! These things, these decisions are really, really hard. 

01:19:45
ANNIE It, it's, it's weird. It's, I don't, I don't feel this way when I'm not out in the world, but, I mean, here with you in this setting, I don't, I don't know. This, these emotions just seem sort of compounded, but when I'm out there, it's fine. So I, I, I don't 

01:20:05
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Can I normalize that for you? Um, a setting like this is what I try to do and what other therapists often to do is create a setting place for you to really experience what you want. And I've been asking you a whole series of questions about what do you, what do you want, what do you want, I keep saying that in different ways. And what's happening is that you're, you're starting to release what you want and feel what you want, and you're feeling the conflict around that. Because you're realizing what you want is very different from what he wants. And it sounds like in other areas, you're able to just not look at that and not deal with that which explains why this is so hard for you here in this moment. 

01:21:05
ANNIE Yeah. Yeah. 

01:21:10
STEVEN SCHEUTZ I'm struck by how loyal you are. It's really resonating for me and how much you love the people in your life. But also about how much you really want this for yourself. 

01:21:30
ANNIE I do. But it's not practical. 

01:21:35
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Life isn't practical! What's practical have to do with it? Life isn't practical. Life is a series of impracticalities. 

01:21:45
ANNIE But the, if it doesn't make sense, right, if it doesn't translate into being bigger by getting, by finishing college, what's the point? It's not really practical. 

01:21:55
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Well, there's some, there's some pretty big assumptions there. Um, but let's, let's go with, let's go with "it's not practical." Does everything in your life that you do need to be practical? 

01:22:10
ANNIE The big decisions, yes. 

01:22:10
STEVEN SCHEUTZ What happens when you make big decisions that aren't practical? 

01:22:15
ANNIE You waste time, you waste money. 

01:22:20
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Okay, that's really reasonable. Um, are there ever not practical decisions that add value to your life outside of time and money? 

01:22:35
ANNIE I don't know. 

01:22:40
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Children are not practical. Children waste a lot of time and a lot of money, but we really value our children. 

01:22:50
ANNIE Well, children are practical because in my culture, when you get older, your children will take care of you. So they are practical. 

01:23:05
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Are degrees ever practical? 

01:23:05
ANNIE If you wanna do something in the field. 

01:23:10
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Might you want to do something in the field eventually? Children grow up. What I'm doing here is I'm trying, I'm challenging some of your ideas. I'm doing it very deliberately. And I, and I see that that process is really hard for you. I'm wanting to show you what I'm doing and talk about it so you don't get too frustrated. Is that okay? Okay. 

01:23:40
[sil.] 

01:23:45
STEVEN SCHEUTZ It seems like, um, there's some really hard decisions here for you to make. And I'm wondering what it would be like for you, maybe as an assignment, just to try out in your head thinking, questioning some of the ideas that you have. What if I actually did choose to make myself happy? What would I get? Questioning is there a way to talk to my partner about this that might help them understand? I have questions even about his being intimidated by the fact that you're changing a little bit. If throughout the course of your life, you will change, if only because we, we all age. He's going to have to make adjustments to who you, who you become and who you are. Um, your learning, your learning curve is really high school right now, it is for most people, so you're learning a lot all at once and maybe you're making a lot of changes all at once. That's often hard, difficult for spouses and, um, so that's not necessarily just your situation. That's lot of different situations. But I'm wondering if you had more of an explicit conversation with him about that and explain that and talked about ways that you could actually figure that out for both of you, I'm curious about what would happen. And maybe today, that's too hard or difficult to think about having that sort of a, um, blatant conversation, but I'm wondering if it might be possible in the future? 

01:25:40
ANNIE I wouldn't know what to say. 

01:25:45
[sil.] 

01:25:50
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Do you ever make requests of him? Even small requests? 

01:25:55
ANNIE Well, yeah. 

01:25:55
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Like what? What was the last thing you asked him for? That wasn't practical? 

01:26:00
ANNIE Impractical? 

01:26:00
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Impractical. 

01:26:00
ANNIE Well, I didn't have to ask, but, you know, he bought me, you know, some earrings, and I really liked it. 

01:26:05
STEVEN SCHEUTZ That's great. Anything that you actually asked for? 

01:26:10
ANNIE I mean, if he's on his way home, I ask him to pick up something from my favorite restaurant, I don't know. 

01:26:20
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Can I give you a homework, a homework assignment? I'd like you to ask him for something impractical that's small. 

01:26:30
ANNIE What would that be? 

01:26:30
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Uh, going  a mile out of his way to get you a Slurpee. Something silly like that. I see on your face that you think it's absurd. Why, why am I asking you to do this? 

01:26:55
ANNIE Yeah, I kinda do a little bit. It's, it's always the gas money. To go a mile to get a Slurpee, I guess it's really expensive. 

01:27:00
STEVEN SCHEUTZ You don't know how to ask for what you want. And I'm wondering if it might be helpful for you to learn in a really small way that doesn't matter. But that might not be valuable for you. What do you think? 

01:27:25
ANNIE I don't really, maybe ask me to come up with something to, that I want that's impractical, I don't know what that would be. 'Cuz I'm, I think, a pretty practical person. 'Cuz I don't, I don't really know how to be impractical, I mean, I don't, I don't know. 

01:27:45
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Well, I'm wondering if you would be, just be willing to think about asking him for that and think about, thinking about it as an, just an experiment. If it doesn't fit for you and it doesn't work, that's fine, okay? But I'm wondering if you'll think about doing that, and I'm also, going back to the idea, I'm wondering if you'll think about, um, what the consequences would be in your life of making decisions that are a little bit more around getting what you want and if there are ways that you could trust yourself enough to know that if you did that, you still might be able to explain those decisions to people that you love who love you so that they might understand it. 

01:28:35
[sil.] 

01:28:40
ANNIE I don't think my family would understand that. My family's pretty practical. 

01:28:45
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Sounds like they're very practical. And it sounds like that practicality really sort of holds you hostage. 

01:29:00
ANNIE It makes sense. 

01:29:00
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Yeah. To the extent that they get what they want. You are part of a group, there are rules, there are limits, but sometimes our assumptions about what the group wants and what the group needs, um, is a little bit restricting because it might be helpful for the whole group for you to have an education, for you to have a different way of thinking about things, for you to be happy. What if the whole group gets a happy you for the next 20 years versus a regretful you for the next 20 years? Just a, just an idea. 

01:29:30
ANNIE I'm pretty happy around them. 

01:29:40
[sil.] 

01:29:45
STEVEN SCHEUTZ In general, yes, I believe you. But it also, I saw today you carry a lot of, um, want, desire. Yeah. We're almost out of time. I know today has in some ways been a little rough for you. 

01:30:10
ANNIE Yeah. 

01:30:10
STEVEN SCHEUTZ Yeah. I want you to know that I'm just really impressed by how big this struggle is for you, and I, and I hope that, um, I hope you'll find a way to sort of listen to your own voice and honor you in this process. It's good to meet you. 

01:30:35
ANNIE Thank you, you too. 

01:30:40

Processing the 5 Approaches to Psychotherapy with the Client 

01:30:40
Manivong J. Ratts, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Seattle University and Annie, the client 

01:31:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS Hi, Annie. How are you? 

01:31:05
ANNIE Hi, I'm good, thanks. And you? 

01:31:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS I'm really good, thank you. Um, well, I just wanna say thank you for, uh, being able to work with each of our five therapists. You've had an opportunity to work with Dr. Sheri Hunt who was really operating from a psychoanalytic perspective, um, Katherine Nordell who was working as a CBT therapist, uh, demonstrating elements of CBT, and you also had an opportunity to work with Steven Scheutz who worked, uh, from a existential humanistic paradigm, um, Dr. Agnes Kwong who was working from a multicultural framework, and then, uh, the last therapist you worked with was Dr. Michael Hutchins who was operating from a social justice framework. And what I wanted to do today was just spend some time with you to sort of process each of those sessions, uh, and if, just sort of hear from you in terms of what you liked, didn't like about your work with each of the therapists and, and what resonated with you. Um, is that okay? 

01:32:05
ANNIE Yeah, yeah. 

01:32:05
MANIVONG J. RATTS If we can start with the psychoanalytic perspective, that was the first, uh, therapist you worked with, Dr. Sheri Hunt. Um, what was your experience like, uh, as a client working with her, if you can share a little bit? 

01:32:20
ANNIE It felt really enlightening. Um, you know, when I was telling my story, she drew so many connections, um, from my childhood and how that, um, plays out into how I'm currently acting. Um, so in that moment when I was sitting with her, she made so much sense and it felt very, like "Yes, yes, yes," you know, everything she says makes so much sense, um, and I just felt like there was just such a groove going on. Um, it felt, it felt really enlightening. 

01:33:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS Sounds like a lot of, you were gaining a lot of insight. 

01:33:00
ANNIE Right, right. But then, you know, after, after the session and having time to think about it and process it, I felt very, I felt like I couldn't really say no because the connections she was making make so much sense, but then I, it just felt a bit, it felt, 'cuz it made so much sense but it didn't feel pinpoint. Does that make sense? Um 

01:33:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS Help me understand that. 

01:33:45
ANNIE Um, the connections just made a lot of sense. However, when I, when I processed it, I'm like, well, it could, it could've been, it could've been that. Um, so I felt like the conclusions were kind of assumed but not, but maybe not accurate, does that make sense? But at the moment when I was with her, she made a lot of sense, you know? So, um, it was really, it was really enlightening, um, but it, I do wonder about, um, the accuracy of it. 

01:34:20
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay. 

01:34:20
ANNIE Yeah. And she just seemed so knowledgeable that it was kind of hard to, you know, I don't know, but she seemed so knowledgeable. And she was drawing so many connections and so fast and, as I was telling these stories, I was very, there was a lot of stuff going on inside, you know? So I felt like, it just made sense, everything she connected, and I couldn't sit down and filter it and process her, um, connections, but at the moment it felt like the flow was so good, so I just felt like, "Yes, yes, yes." 

01:34:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah, it sounds like you, what you, here you're saying you really connected with her during the session, you liked the insight she was giving you 'cuz it made a lot of sense, logical sense in terms of connecting with, um, your life story, if you will. And I hear you saying also at the same time, you liked her expertise and knowledge, um, that she brought into, into the session. Um, I'm also hearing you say, in a sense, you wonder if, if maybe needing more time is important to be able to make sure these connections she's making, these insights are, are accurate. 

01:35:35
ANNIE Right. 

01:35:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS Uh, if, if I'm hearing you correctly. 

01:35:35
ANNIE Yes. 

01:35:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS Once you went outside of the session and just sort of had time to process it a little bit more, yeah. Yeah. Um, how about the cognitive behavioral therapist, Katherine Nordell? 

01:35:50
ANNIE Yeah, I really, I really felt like we had a really, it felt, our relationship felt more equal, um, than 

01:36:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS Than the first one? 

01:36:00
ANNIE Right, with Dr. Hunt. Um, it felt more equal. Um, but I felt like, she focused a lot on, of course, on my, my thoughts and my feelings, um, and it, it, I didn't feel as listened-to. Um, it just felt like there was a sort of, a pat-, a pattern or a path she wanted to drive me to, um, 'cuz I, I feel like my story is so much more, um, and I felt, it felt kind of narrow. 

01:36:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS Okay, okay. Sounds like you're saying you felt like she had a direction that she wanted to take you, um, and, and that felt limiting. But at the same time, I'm hearing you say you felt the relationship was more egalitarian, uh, you were equals in, in, in your work together, if you will, uh, compared to with Dr. Hunt. Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. Um, anything else you like about your work with Nordell, Katherine Nordell? 

01:37:05
ANNIE Yeah. I just think that we had a really great rapport, I think. I really trusted her. Um, yeah, I think that's the thing that's sticks out the most, the rapport we had with each other. And I felt, yeah, I just felt I was really equal. Yeah. 

01:37:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS How about with Steven Scheutz, the therapist who was operating from an existential humanistic paradigm, kind of what was that experience like for you? 

01:37:35
ANNIE Um, I, I felt kind of confused with the whole experience 'cuz the questions he asked to me didn't make much sense for me to do certain things. Um, and it felt like it was about me, me, me, and I understand that therapy is about me, but there's so many other things going on like my family, my husband, that to focus only on me and not bring them into equation, it felt kinda silly, um, not silly, but, um, yeah, it was, it just wasn't, um, because I can't just think about me, you know, I can't just focus on me. There are other people, you know, near me, um, so it felt like, um, I felt, it felt like he, he couldn't relate to what I was going through. I remember the one, the one question about, um, of him going to get the, the slushie question, um, you know, I feel like that's not, that's not me, that's not what I would do, um, and it seemed a bit strange to ask that question. It didn't seem kind of relevant, so, yeah. But however, I did like, I think it was him, um, where he said that, you know, this is a safe space for you for you to feel your, um, say what you want and feel your emotions 'cuz I think he was the one who said that. Yeah, so I really appreciated that 'cuz I didn't realize that's, this is what this space is for. 

01:39:10
MANIVONG J. RATTS So you like the fact that he was able to set that tone for you? But I also hear you saying one of the limitations or, that you had was you didn't feel like he truly connected with you? I really understood you as, um, an Asian-American in terms of just looking at your family dynamics and, and focusing more so on you as a, an individual, um, which I'm hearing you say is a limited perspective of who you are in relation to your experience. 

01:39:45
ANNIE I thought, I thought it was really Western. Um, yeah, very Western. 

01:39:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS It's interesting because with Katherine you were talking about how it seemed like there was more direction or she kinda knew where she was going, um, and, and there was a logical sequence in terms of her work with you and, and with Stephen, what I'm hearing you say, if I'm hearing you correctly, is that there wasn't necessarily that logical progression of, of what you were doing. Is that, did you feel that? 

01:40:20
ANNIE Yeah, I felt very much like balancing back and forth, the questions that were asked, um, 'cuz I know, um, there was some frustration, uh, 'cuz the way I answered the question, um, I couldn't answer the question the way he wanted me to answer it, so I could sense that he was kind of frustrated, um, because I couldn't see what he was wanting me to see. Um, so I felt he was repeating a lot of things, repeating a question in a different way to sort of get me to an answer he wants me to see. Um, so it didn't feel logical, it just felt sort of circular and like a tennis ball, back and forth, back and forth. 

01:41:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah. Which is interesting 'cuz existential humanistic theorists, uh, and practitioners tend to be, are known to be directionless in terms of just non-directive in their approach, and cognitive behaviorists, uh, tend to be a little bit more, uh, uh, structured in their work with clients, and it's interesting that you're pointing that out or that you're experiencing that. 

01:41:25
ANNIE Oh, cool. 

01:41:25
MANIVONG J. RATTS How about with, uh, Dr. Agnes Kwong, uh, the, uh, multicultural therapist? 

01:41:30
ANNIE I honestly must say that I felt the most listened to with her. I felt the pacing was equal. I just, the pacing was really good, I just felt really listened to and I felt like she had no agenda, um, and she just listened. So, yeah, I think the pacing 

01:42:00
MANIVONG J. RATTS What were, what were things she was doing that made you feel connected or that you were feeling listened to? Were there things in the session that was happening? 

01:42:10
ANNIE I think a lot of it's body language, you know, um, yeah. It's just the way maybe she says "Mm-hmm," you know? Um, I can't be, I can't remember any exact phrases, but just, I just felt listened to, just those simple maybe verbal and facial responses. Yeah, I just felt really listened to, listened at with her. Um, yeah. 

01:42:40
MANIVONG J. RATTS Did you feel that, uh, her, uh, racial identity sort of, uh, uh, helped in terms of you connecting with her or have an influence on your ability to connect with her, the fact that you were both Asian females? 

01:43:00
ANNIE I think maybe, but I'm not quite sure because I felt, I feel more equal with, um, Katherine in terms of like, just personality and, um, not personality, but just equal. But with Nancy, with Dr. Kwong, she felt a little bit more knowledgeable than I am, but still, there's still that sense of like, caring, I guess. So I don't know exactly what it is that made me feel that way with her. I'm not quite sure, if it our similar cultural identity, I'm not quite sure. 

01:43:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay. What was your experience like with Dr. Michael Hutchins who was really operating from a social justice framework and did something a little bit different than the other therapists. 

01:43:50
ANNIE Yeah, he did stuff that I didn't know that counseling do. Um, and I liked that he thought out of the box and helped me, you know, find resources and other options. Um, so that part I really, um, liked 'cuz I saw a bigger picture of what counseling can do. Um, but similar to CBT, it felt very, um, directed. Um, I just felt I was answering questions back and, back and, like, I just, I was just constantly answering questions. I didn't feel like, I didn't feel like he really knew me. I just felt like, I just kept answering the questions that he had for me. So. 

01:44:35
MANIVONG J. RATTS Well, now that you've had an opportunity to work with all five therapists, if there was a therapist you were gonna, uh, continue working with, who might that be? 

01:44:40
ANNIE Um, I think, personally, I think I'm a better fit with Dr. Kwong, um, Dr. Kwong? Um, and perhaps it is because we're the same, um, same culture background. Um, I just felt, it's the fact that I felt really listened to. I felt like she saw me and she heard me. I felt like she didn't rush me. And I think that the directions the other counselors went, I think if I had more time with her, she would've gone those directions also, um, and it was only our first session. Um, yeah, so I like to think that, you know, if we had more time, we would've gone, 'cuz she did, she asked a bit about my childhood, um, like, um, Dr. Hunt, and she did ask me about stuff I was thinking or feeling like, um, Katherine, um, um, yeah. So. 

01:45:45
MANIVONG J. RATTS So she kind of brought elements of other theories, you felt, in your work with her. Or in her work with you. 

01:45:50
ANNIE Right. 

01:45:50
MANIVONG J. RATTS She had a little bit of everything. 

01:45:55
ANNIE I think so. 

01:45:55
MANIVONG J. RATTS And then that cultural piece, it sounds like, was important for you. 

01:45:55
ANNIE Yeah, yeah. So I think, and it was only one session, so I think that more sessions, um, we could've gotten all the other stuff out perhaps. Um, but yeah, the most, most important thing, I just felt really listened to. 

01:46:15
MANIVONG J. RATTS Well, I just wanna thank you for your time and for, um, giving of yourself and sharing your, your, uh, experiences with each of the therapists. I really appreciate it and I know students who watch this video will as well, so thank you. 

01:46:30
ANNIE Great. Thank you, welcome.
