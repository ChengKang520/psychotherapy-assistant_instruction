DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is Fear challenge. Every single one of us is hardwired to feel fear. Many of us feel fear long after the danger has passed, and this is what makes us so difficult to recover after trauma. But, people do recover after trauma every single day. We are hardwired to harness calm, and to reclaim our natural state, which is relaxed joyfulness. Instead of just going along with the automatic internal fear response, you feel fear, use it as an opportunity to practice the fear challenge exercise. You could even practice it by taking a moment to recall a fearful moment, maybe not worst one, since you only started to practice right now. Then using the (inaudible ) to challenge the fear. Let's practice together. First, find that moment of fear, and then "I forgive myself for holding onto this fearful feeling. I see that I've reacted in fear, but I can now know and choose a new and more adaptive response. This is an old fear, and it is okay for me to release it; it no longer serves any true purpose as the actual danger has passed. I can allow myself to embrace calm and move beyond fear."

DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY "Fear is no longer useful to me in this moment. Fear no longer has to define me. I now have new choices. I can now choose to let my body, mind and being harness calm, and release fear from those places. I consciously choose calm. I can feel calm moving deeply into my body, mind and being. I'm finding places and activities in my life right now where I can enjoy this sensation."

DR. ANNA B.BARANOWSKY "I harness calm more and more every day. Today I am experiencing myself more as a calm person." Practice this again throughout the day whenever you need to recapture feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky, from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, Daily Practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
