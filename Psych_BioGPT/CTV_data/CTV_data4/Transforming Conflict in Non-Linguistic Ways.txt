00:00:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE I want to talk about transforming conflict in non-linguistic ways. We have been talking the past couple of days about story-telling and narrative and getting people to re-story their conflicts. I think all of that is great and I think that there are also some beautiful ways that are beyond words that we can deal with conflict. I had the good fortune of being a Fulbright Specialist in Colombia, in Manizales Colombia in June of last year, of this year I guess it was. I was introduced to a project called The War We Have Not Seen, which is a project by Juan Manuel Echavarr√≠a, I'm sorry if mispronounced that, where he has invited ex-combatants in the conflict in Colombia to participate in workshops where they paint scenes from their experience in the conflict. He doesn't teach them how to paint, he doesn't teach them how to be artists. He just asks them to imagine a scene and they sketch the scene and then he asks them how many pieces of canvas they want, he has them all in certain size blocks. And someone might say, I'd like four and they start painting and then could I have two more, how about a couple more and there was an exhibit while I was in Colombia and I was so taken by this art. And so I thought I'd take this opportunity to share it with you. Can we have the next slide, please. There is a book and in fact there is a website that you can go to see all of the paintings that have been done in this project, I believe it's over 400 and in the book that's been put together, I just wanted to frame it by using some of the words that the project director used to describe what he was trying to do. He says a narration through art of a single part of the war we have lived with so many, with for so many years. The show allows us to see the conflict from the perspective of those who have taken up arms, who have tortured and been tortured, of the main actors in the arm conflict in our country. Next slide, the show consisting of works that faithfully represent personal stories, tales unheard until now brought to us through art is one in which no painting is judged based on technique or the painters' abilities. Painting was for these creators, ex-combatants, a means of narrating their untold stories. The paintings are an attempt to alter the cultural weave that has accepted the violence in Colombia as something normal through an artistic proposal aimed at de-stabilizing the social constructs of silence, rhetoric and oblivion. The ingeniousness of the language, the friction between form and content, far from belittling the tragedy makes it even more apparent. These paintings raise questions as to the limitations of the word. We, therefore, build this exhibit around the absence of words to emphasize this void, question it and make it the subject of debate. So, most pressing in and intriguing, can we have the next slide please, this is the title of the project in Spanish, go to the next please. This is a hard the quality of these slides is probably not very good. I was taking photographs, some of the photographs I actually took in the gallery where I was able to see the paintings, some are taken from the book. This is taken from the book and if you look carefully, what I want to point out with this slide is that do notice the empty boxes there. When a museum curates a show and puts together a book for the show, you have text, text that names the artist, tells you a bit about the artist's life, when the artist was born, if the artist is deceased, it has the date that they died and then it describes the medium used and perhaps some further description. Because of the danger of identifying oneself as an artist, rather than simply leave that information out, what they have done is created empty boxes that have no information to let us remember and know the danger of identifying and acknowledging who had painted, now you have to think many of these ex-combatants have escaped from the war. So they don't want to be identified or there would be serious ramifications. These paintings are very colorful and beautiful and in fact Colombia is a beautiful country and the juxtaposition the tentionality between the beauty of the paintings, the beauty of the country and the conflict that has been going on for so long is really captured in these paintings. If you look closely, you see guns, bodies, okay in this one it's hard to pick out, can we see the next slide please, okay, if you see under the tree, in the left-hand corner there, there are armed combatants under the tree and there are some bodies lying on the ground, very primitive and all along the upper edge there. So some of these paintings are extremely primitive, child-like, others are less so. They all show this tension and it allows for the project director intended for people to talk about, to remember the conflict in different ways to create a new narrative and also as we interact with these paintings, it invites us into multiple interpretations. There's not just one. So can we have the next please, I have several slides here so I just wanted to kind of sequence through them not too quickly. So to give people a sense, give us all a sense to see some of look into the picture, again, this one is quite primitive, most many of the paintings have a soccer field which is emblematic of life in Colombia and they almost all have rivers and mountains as well also emblematic. Next one please, okay. This is rounding people up in a perhaps a school house or a home, the church, okay, next. 

00:07:35
[sil.] 

00:07:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE Next. They really are stunning I think and I wish I could bring the actual exhibit to you so you could really feel them more powerfully than these slides do justice. If you can look closely at that, you can see armed soldiers and mostly what's happening is we're seeing them in just local typical villages. Next one. 

00:08:20
[sil.] 

00:08:35
SHEILA MCNAMEE To see how their blocks put together that the artists took one block or two blocks, kept adding expanding the picture, next please, this is another consequence of the conflict is the deforestation and the raping of the environment actually. So that they can grow cocaine. Next. 

00:09:10
[sil.] 

00:09:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE This one is particularly interesting. In the next slide is a close up of one section of this where you see people fleeing and you can see bodies in the water after some attack on a village and that's the close up of one section. 

00:09:45
[sil.] 

00:09:50
SHEILA MCNAMEE This is a particular event where I don't recall where it happened but perhaps you know there was a massacre in a village on the soccer field. They took all the bodies to the soccer field and for eight days they sat there before helicopters came in to remove the bodies and it was quite a tragedy. Next and this is and that's an insert coming from that and we see the bodies lying down, okay. 

00:10:35
[sil.] 

00:10:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE I just wanted to share an example of something that moved me while I was working with university professors and graduate students who are working with former child soldiers, ex-combatants. And simultaneously, this exhibit was taking place and it really did open the possibility for me to stop and think about alternative ways of narrating and storying our lives and in particular, conflict by giving some credibility and some space to these other forms of expression that are rich stories and allow for multiple interpretations and in some ways what I found is that these paintings when you see them up close, they are so moving that the impulse to do something to help transform the conflict seems to be infused in almost everyone who comes in contact with this. So we know that we have dance, we have theater, we have art, we do have many non-linguistic ways and I just when we think about language and the focus on social construction on language we really are talking about all embodied activity which embraces all of these things and I think it's nice for us to remember that we should include the arts more frequently in our work particularly around conflict. So I open it up for questions or comments, anyone? 

00:12:35
 (inaudible ) 

00:12:40
SHEILA MCNAMEE  I really don't know why they did it that way. Perhaps it was manageable to have, I mean there really were blocks about this size and with the canvas stretched over it and it may be just and perhaps not to be to intimidating to people who'd never painted before. So, yeah, I don't know the actual reason for that. Pat? 

00:13:10
 (inaudible ) 

00:13:15
SHEILA MCNAMEE  They did them in a workshop but people did their own. So no one was collaborating on the same piece. The book, as I said, there are over 400 of these and the similarity may be my selection because I took the ones that really spoke to me and some of them as I said, were ones that I actually saw, there were I think 18 being exhibited. There are others that are very different, they are very dark and I didn't show those. But there is a real similarity. 

00:13:55
 (inaudible ) 

00:14:00
SHEILA MCNAMEE I mean the story is repeated, village to village to village and that is I mean that's also really it's a startling recognition of what appears to be such a hidden conflict, hidden away in the mountains but then when you see it over and over and over again, and you think how widespread it is, yeah which is I think another powerful aspect of this project. Yeah. 

00:14:50
 (inaudible ) 

00:14:55
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah, excellent question, I think it moved me so much and unfortunately, fortunately but unfortunately I saw this just as I was leaving. So I wonder how it would have changed because I was there to talk about to work with the groups who are working with former with the ex-combatants and so but it has given me pause to think about we talk so much about how to get people to talk differently when they are in conflict. What else can we do? And it's really made me start thinking of alternative forms of action of drawing, there's also there's another project a woman I know who has an art, it's called ArtsBridge and she brings Israeli and Palestinian youth together for I think a month or six weeks in the summer and the first task they are given a huge piece of paper and they are paired Israeli, Palestinian to make a drawing together. And generally in that first moment, the paper is lined down the middle and one half here and one half here and then over the weeks, they create these and it's not easy, I mean they talk about the conflict, they have different sessions but the main thing is producing art together. And they're not polite, they deal with it but the art is something that allows them eventually over time to find ways to talk with one another. So, I think that we can take some good lessons from these. Right. 

00:16:40
 (inaudible ) 

00:16:45
SHEILA MCNAMEE Yeah, I think that they were invited to draw their memories to be able to express so to speak what they had experienced that they didn't feel like talking about. So it was very much framed as the bad stuff you've been through basically. 

00:17:15
 (inaudible ) 

00:17:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE  Not that I know of except there were I showed the empty boxes where you'd have the information. There were a few that actually were bold enough to write about what the picture was representing and what it was in their life like what that, that's them they've painted into the picture and say a little bit more detail about what that experience was like but really I think I saw it too out of all that did, there may be more, I didn't look through carefully. But I think you raised an interesting point, what if with the two part workshop where they do these and then they're invited to paint what would peace look like. 

00:18:15

00:18:20
SHEILA MCNAMEE Thank you.
