"This revised Interpersonal Process Recall series is dedicated to the loving memory of my husband, Dr. Norman I. Kagan." Henya Kagan (Klein) IPR IPR Interpersonal Process Recall Introduction & Theory Created by Dr. Norman Kagan Produced & Directed by Bill Crawford 

00:00:00
NARRATOR  Very little in our life affects us more than our relationships with others. In fact, these interactions are often our greatest source of pleasure and at the same time, our greatest source of pain. Unfortunately, this aspect of our lives remains a little understood phenomena for most of us. For example, have you ever wondered why we continue to seek out relationships- 

00:01:05
Divorce 

00:01:05
NARRATOR  -even after very difficult and painful experiences? And why are we powerfully drawn to some people and not to others? And even when we do become close with someone, why do we suddenly become uncomfortable or unsure of ourselves? 

00:01:20
IPR Patterns? Patterns? Patterns? 

00:01:20
NARRATOR  Are there patterns in our relationships? And if so, do we unknowingly play a role in creating these patterns? And when interacting with another, how is it possible to pick up or sense what another is feeling even before words are spoken? 

00:01:35
IPR ? 

00:01:35
NARRATOR  And probably the most important question, is it possible to become more influential or skilled in this all-important aspect of our lives? Interpersonal Process Recall or IPR is specifically designed to answer these and other questions about relating to others.

00:01:55
NARRATOR Dr. Kagan will describe the theory and structure of the IPR model. 

00:02:00
NORMAN KAGAN  I'm Norman Kagan. I designed and developed the IPR, Interpersonal Process Recall model. Through the years, I was helped by many fine colleagues and students. I wanna tell you a bit about the program and the theoretical concepts which explain why it works and how it works. By the way, the theoretical concepts apply only to interpersonal behavior and many of the ideas are new but others have been around in psychology for a long time. IPR started with research on how to teach mental health workers to be more effective. The research study has helped us to clearly define goals and helped us to develop methods, which consistently resulted in people listening more closely to what people were telling them, to hear messages they would've missed before and also to improve their ability to impact positively the quality of their interactions with others. We found that teaching specific skills was useful but even more effective is the manner in which the IPR model builds on the natural talents people already have. Helping people improved their own interpersonal style to achieve their own personal and professional goals. It turned out, that IPR methods were complicated just as people are complicated. But the methods could be taught into nearly any group of people regardless of their background or previous training. We found many different groups who wanted to learn what we had developed. Firemen, army officers, drill sergeants, medical students, physicians, lawyers, many more saw the value of this training and enthusiastically participated in the process. The problem then became that more groups were asking for the training than we could accommodate. So when the methods were understood well enough to be specified, I developed a film series over several years of work to make it easier for instructors to teach IPR and easier for students to learn from IPR. Today, most universities and many community film libraries have the IPR film series so that you can use IPR as a method of improving your own interpersonal effectiveness if you choose too. (coughs) Incidentally, ah, as you'll see the clothing and hairstyle in some of the films are outdated, please don't let that interfere with your use of the films. Try to keep in mind that people themselves probably haven't changed much in the last 50,000 or so years, and certainly people haven't changed much since even the earliest of our films were made. Well then, the process. The process begins, uhm, with a set of interpersonal skills and an analysis of how and when to use them. Here, actors demonstrate different ways of responding to a person's statement. In the next unit, we again use simulations of interpersonal scenarios to help put you in touch with the type of situations which make most of us especially uncomfortable. We'll then examine these interpersonal allergies to others and you're given practice at responding in ways, which should help you become less allergic and more effective in difficult situations. At the next point in the training, a video or audio tape will be made of an interaction between yourself and another person. The way in which you will then review these tapes puts you in control of your own learning. This is an effective way to learn to improve your own interpersonal style and is based on the assumption that you- 

00:05:50
IPR 

00:05:50
NORMAN KAGAN - are the world's leading authority on yourself. After this self-study recall experiences, you'll receive feedback from the persons you interacted with, again, through the recall process on how you received by them. This is then followed by what is called "mutual recall" in which you and another person review your tapes together, simultaneously, learning to recognize and master the most subtle aspects of human interaction. Throughout the series, you will also view candid films made of counseling, psychotherapy, medical setting, supervision, families, couples, and classroom sessions and so on, in which the participants used the same recall process, which you will be using. In order to avoid the problem of trying to determine where you are in terms of previous training, I've built in to each unit enough richness, so that beginners can feel comfortable and yet, even the most psychologically advanced among you, will find ample challenge. 

00:07:00
NORMAN KAGAN  All right. Let me tell you more about the model. IPR serves three functions which are interrelated. As a research tool, it enables examination of interpersonal, psychological events in ways not previously possible. It is also, of course, the core of our training model. In addition, it is an interpersonal theory. A theory of human interaction. These three facets. IPR the research method, IPR the training model and IPR the interpersonal theory are interdependent and cannot be separated from each other. Let me tell you now about the theory, which is the foundation of the IPR methods. It's my belief that the better you understand the underlying principles behind IPR, the more effective you will be in using it for yourself. See what you think. 

00:08:05
IPR 

00:08:05
NORMAN KAGAN First and foremost, people need each other. And that is a part of our basic nature. For millions of years, our ability to rely on each other is what permitted us to survive and inhabit the Earth. We had to rely on each other. Alone in nature and individual human is extremely vulnerable and helpless, com, compared say to a cat. We humans survived only because we lived in community. Despite the problems, failures, and difficulties, we today, still have that same basic need to continue to come together to form relationships, living and working communities and working alliances with other people. Our need for human interaction, to nurture and be nurtured, to understand and be understood is basic. Almost this basic is our need for food and water. Why then, do so many of our problems in life revolved around our relationships with others? Hhmm, consider this. People learn to fear each other. Most of these fears are learned as a child. This is not hard to understand if you just remember how small and powerless children are. Their total survival depends on others and so our most impressionable years are as little people among giants. It's easy to see how we as children, in our modern society could learn to fear that the powerful people in our lives might not take care of us or might hurt us. We fear disapproval, punishment, being hurt physically or emotionally, we fear of fear abandonment, of being left or rejected. These fears contribute to a very real sense of vulnerability. And this feeling of being vulnerable can easily persist and be triggered throughout our life. Almost as if we retain a hypersensitivity to vulnerability. A sort of "interpersonal allergy" to situations and people. Children also learn to fear their own potential to hurt others. The fear of their own power to inflict damage. In childhood and in adolescence, we strive for independence, for identity and integrity. We experience the fear of becoming controlled by another or too dependent on another. And also, the fear of our temptation to use another for our own needs without concern for them. 

00:10:55
IPR 

00:10:55
NORMAN KAGAN  These fundamental, "bottom line" fears, can be summarized in four basic statements. One. If I'm not careful, I will be hurt. We feel as if we're small and vulnerable, the other bigger and more powerful. Like being a small person in a big person's world. Two. If I'm not careful, I will hurt others. We fear our own potential, for aggression may act out. Note how uncomfortable we can be around people who are vulnerable or suffering. At funerals for instance. Three. If I'm not careful, I will be engulfed. We fear we'll be swallowed up, controlled. We'll lose our independence, our integrity. Fear of becoming a wimped, handpicked, dominated, used, taken advantage of. Four. If I'm not careful, I will engulf others. We fear we will misuse others. Use them to act out our physical, sexual, or emotional needs. 

00:12:15
IPR "Bottom line" Fears 1. I will be hurt 2. I will hurt others 3. I will be engulfed 4. I will engulf others 

00:12:15
NORMAN KAGAN Can you think of anyone you've had contact with, who clearly was experiencing one or more of these four fears? Do you recognize any of these "bottom line" fears in yourself as basic elements of your own interpersonal reactions? Are you more sensitive, more allergic to anyone of them than to the others? 

00:12:35
sil. 

00:12:35
NORMAN KAGAN  When we re-experience, in force, some of the "bottom line" concerns, hurting or being hurt, engulfing or being engulfed, in our relationships as adults. That's when we have problems in our dealings with others. Most of us attribute our interpersonal allergies to the other person, their anger, bad judgment, their inappropriate behavior, them. And certainly, this is the case in some instances. But what if in most interpersonal situations were being controlled less by another person, than by fears of human interactions which we have carried around with us since childhood? If this is true, we could spend a lifetime trying to change and manipulate the world around us and never feel completely safe or satisfied. 

00:13:35
IPR 

00:13:35
NORMAN KAGAN  If we need people but also fear people, what happens? Our basic need for each other combined with these fears, sets up an approach-avoidance dynamic, which has us being drawn toward others, seeking the intimacy and companionship we desire and then withdrawing when this closeness becomes too intense. When we are too close, we experience anxiety. Sweaty palms, shortness of breath, heavy heartbeats, eye pupil dilation. On the other hand, when we don't have enough human interaction or when we're too remote from others, most of us experience the pain of sensory deprivation. Loneliness, boredom, a feeling of yearning for human contact, sometimes, any human contact. In our attempt to cope with this approach-avoidance dynamic, we try to establish a comfortable psychological distance. 

00:14:55
IPR 

00:14:55
NORMAN KAGAN Whereby, we limit how close we will let people get to us. We let people get close but not too close. Some of us are more comfortable with closeness than with being alone. Or some of us are more comfortable with being alone than with closeness. We have a tendency to seek out people and situations, which most closely match our own level of psychological distance. Now, this is possible when choices are abundantly available. But what about the times when we're required to interact with those who are very different from us? Most of us become less effective and less satisfied in such situations. 

00:15:45
IPR 

00:15:45
NORMAN KAGAN Flexibility seems to be the mark of people who are most comfortable in their relations with others. That is, they can enjoy close human interaction and can also be comfortable with periods of aloneness. They're effective in situations, which call for comfort in a wide range of interpersonal abilities. Let's consider now how our basic fears of hurt and engulfment influence our perceptions of ourselves and the world around us. We develop expectations of how the world will react to us. Based on our fears, we expect to be treated in a certain way and then we look for evidence that this is happening. That indeed, we all being reacted to in the ways we had feared but predicted. We interpret the evidence we received from the outside world or create the evidence ourselves based on our expectations. 

00:16:45
IPR 

00:16:45
NORMAN KAGAN  We anticipate being hurt or hurting, being engulfed or engulfing others and we then create our own self-fulfilling prophesy. 

00:17:00
IPR Selp-Fulfilling Prophesy Anticipations Expectations 

00:17:00
NORMAN KAGAN This then, reinforces our expectations and the cycle goes on and on and on. Am I suggesting that we can make our interpersonal nightmares happen? Yes, I am. Of course, there are random events, which happen to us. They are opportunities, which are, are presented to us, and opportunities which we seek but which are denied to us. But there are also ways in which we help make our nightmares happen. 

00:17:35
IPR 

00:17:35
NORMAN KAGAN We have our familiar fears. We expect familiar pain and we then travel familiar pathways. Let's now examine what happens behaviorally, when someone gets too close, encroaches on us, violates our psychological safety zone. How do we react behaviorally? By behaviorally, I mean, reactions by us that other people could observed in us from the outside. As I describe each of the following types of behaviors, try to think of someone you know who relies heavily on that kind of behavior. Okay. One way of responding to people coming too close is attack. 

00:18:30
IPR 

00:18:30
NORMAN KAGAN A person who relies on this mode automatically reacts to others with anger or aggression. As they experienced a person impinging on them, they strike out, are hostile, nasty, aggressive. Another possible way of responding is withdrawal. A person who relies on this mode is almost always quiet and reserved when approached by people. This person reacts by going limp, interpersonally. Conforming is the third basic kind of behavioral response. People who rely on this mode tend to always say what they believe others want to hear. They blend with the other like an interpersonal chameleon. 

00:19:20
IPR Basic Elements ATTACK WITHDRAW CONFORM 

00:19:20
NORMAN KAGAN These behaviors are basic elements and it's important also to note that these behaviors are negative only when we use them to excess. Over relying on one or another of them for instance, ah, we react aggressively, ah, when we wish we could've reacted differently. Interestingly enough, these behaviors can also be a problem for us if we cannot engage in that kind of behavior at all. For example, the person who can never stand up to another even in mildly assertive, socially appropriate ways is just as ineffective as the person who always strikes out before finding out what is being asked. Another word about these behaviors are, although I've used the extreme term for each, each is actually a type of behavior with its own continuum, ranging from mild to extreme. For instance,- 

00:20:30
IPR 

00:20:30
NORMAN KAGAN - attack, ah, can range from ah, firmness or assertiveness, all the way to outright aggression. Withdrawal from being a quiet listener, all the way to complete interpersonal unresponsiveness. Conform from being agreeable, all the way to being an interpersonal chameleon. Can you think of people in your own life who have a lot of difficultly with one or another of these behaviors? Do you, yourself find any especially difficult for you to use? 

00:21:10
[sil.] 

00:21:10
NORMAN KAGAN  Interpersonal behaviors can actually be more complex than what I've just described. To better understand the more complex human interpersonal behaviors, we must look not only at the immediate reaction to interpersonal threat, that is attack, withdrawal, conform but also to the effect over time of the behaviors. 

00:21:35
IPR 

00:21:35
NORMAN KAGAN  The long term patterns, which a person creates. For instance, some people attack and create a life pattern characterized by aloneness in essence, withdrawal. On the other hand, others withdraw in the immediacy of an interaction but to subtle things, which inflict suffering on others. In effect, attack. Still, others appear to conform, to cooperate but actually sabotage others behind their backs. Again, in essence, attack. Similarly, the immediate behavior of withdrawal can enable a life pattern of conformity. Attack too, can enable a life pattern of conformity. Ah, often we see this pattern in ah, members of cults or extreme political groups. So a fundamental question to ask ourselves is not only what is the behavior we use, but also, what long term pattern might this behavior set up? These past several minutes, I've been discussing behavioral reactions to encroachment to perceive violations of our psychological space but what about our reactions to boredom, loneliness and sensory deprivation? Do we use the same behaviors? In other words, could attack behaviors be a way of making contact, however distorted? How about conforming as a way of pleading for affiliation? Could another of our solutions to boredom be to seek substitute or vicarious sources of stimulation including such high intensity activities as dangerous acts or delinquency? We usually think of alcohol and/or drugs as a reaction to anxiety. But is it possible that alcohol and drugs are a solution to boredom and loneliness for some people? 

00:23:55
[sil.] 

00:23:55
NORMAN KAGAN  If you could look closely enough, if you had the right interpersonal microscope, you would see how a person plants the seeds of long-term lifestyle in the immediate behavior. That is the person's immediate behavior is enacted in such a way that the person creates the long-term life pattern. We play the main role in creating our own lifestyle. The immediate and long-term behavior patterns are the result of our self-fulfilling prophesies that are in turn, the elaboration of our subjective, basic fears. 

00:24:40
IPR 

00:24:40
NORMAN KAGAN  Let's review briefly, the events I've described as if they were sequential. First, people need each other but also learn to fear each other. These interpersonal fears take the form of four themes. You will hurt me, I will hurt you, you will engulf me, I will engulf you. To satisfy our needs in the presence of our fears, we establish an interpersonal distance, keeping the pain of anxiety and of loneliness in check as best we can. The basic types of behavior available to us are variations of attack, withdraw and conform behaviors. The long-term life patterns are embedded in each of the, these behaviors and are driven as self-fulfilling prophesies by what we anticipate will happen. 

00:25:45
NORMAN KAGAN  For instance, we all know people who fear others will reject them and so they attack. In so doing, they set up a long-term pattern of withdrawal, which they themselves created based on their initial fear of rejection. Can you think of a type of person for each combination of immediate behavior and long-term lifestyle? Can you see how any of these people make their own nightmares happen? 

00:26:20
sil. 

00:26:20
NORMAN KAGAN  Okay. What is desirable? As in our experience of psychological closeness and distance, behavioral flexibility in our relations with others would seem to be the characteristic of effective people. They speak out assertively when it's appropriate to do so and they're comfortable with silence as well. They're able to listen to others or to go along with others when that behavior makes the most sense to them. And also, they have the ability to forge their own path, march to their own drummer, when that is their choice. So then, here we have these opposing forces. The need to belong combined with the fear of being hurt or controlled by others and a host of complex behaviors and combinations of behaviors we use in response. Given these dynamics, it's easy to see how forming and maintaining successful relationships might be one of life's most challenging endeavors. Let's take a moment to talk about what you would like to achieve as a result of this training. 

00:27:40
NORMAN KAGAN  Perhaps one of your goals in going through this IPR unit is to become less "allergic" and less controlled by your fears of other people. Another goal might be to develop a high level of flexibility or comfort over a wider range of psychological distance. In other words, to be able to be effective regardless of whether the situation calls for closeness or distance. A third goal might be to improve your behavioral options or to work on lessening your dependence on behaviors, which you may tend to over-use. And also to become more comfortable with behaviors, which might have been difficult for you in the past. 

00:28:25
sil. 

00:28:25
NORMAN KAGAN  The next section will describe how IPR can help you in achieving these goals. The IPR training is based on the belief that you have already an incredible ability to read other people's feelings. Why? Well, let's again take a perspective of several million years. Early in the evolution of our species, before the language centers in our brains were developed well enough to permit formal speech, we had to be able to read each other. This ability was basic for survival. Faced with a constantly threatening environment, humans survived only by banding together, to cooperate with each other for defense against predators and for food and shelter. 

00:29:35
IPR 

00:29:35
NORMAN KAGAN The biological predisposition to cooperate with each other, to care for each other, is what enabled us to survive and prosper as a species. 

00:29:45
NORMAN KAGAN Our ability to sense what each other is thinking and feeling also then, became an absolute necessity for survival. Today, we find ourselves as a result of our evolution with both a need to come together with each other and an ability to sense each other's emotional state. We have a powerful need to be with other people and an incredible ability to read each other's emotions. Interestingly enough, we don't use this ability well or to its fullest. I believe we know much more than we are aware we know. We perceive much more than we acknowledge, more than we let on to others or even to ourselves. We've all seen instances in which two people talk to each other, smile at each other. But each knows they're furious with each other. Each knows. And each might even be willing to share that knowledge with a third person. Another support for this belief comes from the research of Eckhardt Hess. Hess made two copies of the same photo of a woman's face. On one copy, he slightly enlarged the pupils of her eyes using a photographic touch-up pencil. He then showed the two photos to large numbers of people. 

00:31:20
IPR 

00:31:20
NORMAN KAGAN  And the photo with the enlarged eye pupils was viewed by most people as softer, more feminine and more attractive than the other photo but no one could say why. That is, no one was consciously aware that the only difference in the photos was the size of the dark part of the eyes. And yet, on some level, each person knew something was different. There is also evidence than when, that when viewing the photo of the woman with enlarged pupils, the viewers, themselves, experience some increase in the dilation of their own pupils, suggesting that the way we read other people is through a kind of contagion. That is, we experience the other person's emotion in a way which is similar to the sympathetic vibration of tuning forks, where one vibrating tuning fork sets the other one in motion without physical contact with each other. 

00:32:25
IPR 

00:32:25
NORMAN KAGAN  We know the emotions of another person then through what we ourselves feel from them through some subtle process in our own brain. We then read ourself to know another. Incidentally, why would enlarged pupils make someone look more attractive to us? There are plausible explanations. When we're interested in something or someone, the pupils of our eyes dilate. This is an interesting finding of modern physiology but the ancients knew it too. To look more attractive to men, many centuries ago, women put small amounts of a drug containing atropine in their eyes which would dilate their pupils. The name of the drug? Belladonna, beautiful lady. Now, keep in mind that pupil size is only one of dozens of sources of information we receive and send each other. The glossiness of the skin, the facial muscles, color changes, tightening of lips, body posture, movements, micro facial expressions, these and many more are sources of knowledge we intuitively have relied on for at least hundreds of thousand of years. 

00:33:55
IPR 

00:33:55
NORMAN KAGAN  The human brain has different centers where the work of living goes on. 

00:34:05
Reptilion Complex 

00:34:05
NORMAN KAGAN Among them are centers which look like and function like similar parts in the brains of the so called more primitive species which seem to help us to sense what's happening around us. There are other parts of our brain which are centers for the creation of pictures and patterns. Although we can't see as well as a hawk or smell as well as a hound, we- 

00:34:35
IPR Smell Sight 

00:34:35
NORMAN KAGAN - are not completely devoid of these and other very primitive but amazing attributes. Perhaps, there is something of every creature within us. 

00:34:45
IPR Lymbic System 

00:34:45
NORMAN KAGAN Especially in the centers where emotions are created and visual memories are stored. Perhaps, this explains our sometimes uncanny ability to sense things. For instance, to be aware of someone's presence before we actually see them and other so called intuitive abilities, as well. 

00:35:05
IPR Neocortex 

00:35:05
NORMAN KAGAN And then there are other more recently evolved centers in our brain (clears throat) which clearly separate us from other species, the centers for language and for anticipating the future. Unfortunately, these recent and more primitive centers are not always on good speaking terms. For instance, most of us don't use our language centers to put labels on our perceptions, our intuitions or to put labels on our emotions. They exist instead as unnamed experiences. Often we're not even aware of our emotions or perceptions. If we are unaware of what we've perceived or unaware of what emotions we've experienced, we will also be unaware of how they have impacted our behavior. In one sense, we will be at the mercy of our reactions or as I have said before, controlled by our fears rather than being in a position to influence these reactions. But if, instead, we can learn to recognize and then label our perceptions even better to say how we feel. We would be in a much better position to anticipate what behavior usually follows and then to choose to allow or to change this behavior to meet our goals. 

00:36:35
IPR "Fear!" "Danger!" "Fight or Flight!" 

00:36:35
NORMAN KAGAN  Most of the time, we do not use our language centers to attach names to our perceptions or to label our emotional reactions or to put into language our foresight. While it would be impractical and perhaps debilitating to try to label our every intuitive process, I still contend that if we don't know what we have perceived and what our emotions are, we're not likely to anticipate our own behavior or be in a position to deliberately, willfully influence this behavior. 

00:37:10
IPR 

00:37:10
NORMAN KAGAN  Logic is language based. It requires language. We cannot conclude that we don't have to react in a particular way until we put those thoughts and feelings into words. For example, have you ever noticed how the simple act of putting into words the worst possible outcome of one of our worries results in the lessening of tension and anxiety that comes from the realization,- 

00:37:45
IPR 

00:37:45
NORMAN KAGAN - "Oh, is that all which could happen? I could survive that." Putting emotions into language enables us to use logic and reason and to look at our fearful expectations through the miracle of language, to look closely and see then that the ferocious wolf, on close examination, is really very old and toothless. This process is especially powerful when we share these words with someone who is genuinely concerned and will listen supportively. Why does just sharing our concerns with someone help us feel less stressed? Well, when we have a problem, we often have emotions not only around the problem but also about ourselves for having the problem, feelings of shame or embarrassment. When we share our problem with someone who will listen supportively, our feelings of shame are generally lessened and so, at least, the embarrassment about the problem is relieved. That is why we so value people who really understand us. Even if they don't help us resolve our problem. The fact is, being understood by someone, is one of our more satisfying, nourishing, affirming experiences. Okay, let's see if we can tie this all together. 

00:39:25
IPR 

00:39:25
NORMAN KAGAN  If we can learn to recognize what we sense. To name how we feel. To consider the logic or reasonableness of our thoughts. To anticipate our behavior. To evaluate the consequences of our behavior. And finally, modify our behaviors accordingly. 

00:39:50
IPR 

00:39:50
NORMAN KAGAN And these abilities would result in greater behavioral flexibility. And greater comfort with the nourishment of human intimacy and closeness as well as greater enjoyment of the peace and calm of solitude as well. This, in general, is what IPR is designed to help you do by building on sophisticated knowledge you already have. 

00:40:15
IPR 

00:40:15
NORMAN KAGAN  The IPR training model first teaches skills which were identified from the study of effective communicators. That is, people who were judged effective on the basis of client feedback, as well as independent evaluations by experts. It turned out that the skills ah, used are congruent with my beliefs about human interaction. But skills are easily learned and unfortunately, just as easily forgotten if the use of the skills puts us into uncomfortable positions with other people. And interpersonal skills are, after all, designed to foster greater psychological intimacy with another person. So, unless we help you become comfortable with such interactions, you may not continue to use the skills you've learned. 

00:41:10
IPR 

00:41:10
NORMAN KAGAN  Therefore, the next unit provides experiences designed to help us overcome our interpersonal anxieties. After that, well, if we believe that we know more than we used directly, the training next should encourage you to- 

00:41:30
IPR 

00:41:30
NORMAN KAGAN  -practice labeling what you perceive, but don't usually name. We achieve this by having you recall the thoughts and feelings you would had while you were interacting with another person by reviewing audio or videotapes of yourself which were made of you interacting with that person. In order to review the tapes for each other, you will be taught the inquirer role which I'll tell you more about in a few minutes. Well, what next? 

00:42:05
IPR 

00:42:05
NORMAN KAGAN To expand your knowledge of how your efforts to influence another were received, you will get feedback from the other with whom you related. One of the inevitable discoveries that emerges during this recall of the other process, is the amount of time and energy the other devotes to feelings and thoughts about us, the person they were talking to, regardless of the surface content of what we were talking about. And so, the next phase. Through mutual recall, we help you develop the skill at recognizing and mastering the most subtle aspects of human interaction: the meta-communication between you and another as you talk. Finally, we encourage you to use the recall process in sessions especially relevant to your own real world situations so that there's a greater likelihood that you'll use what you've learned back home. 

00:43:15
IPR 

00:43:15
NORMAN KAGAN All right. Let's review the IPR Model once more in even more detail. And I think you'll begin to see how the model is related to our theory and how it can be useful to you in your interactions with others. Let's begin- 

00:43:30
IPR The IPR Model

NORMAN KAGAN - by looking at the skills unit. This unit teaches specific interpersonal behaviors to add to your repertoire. The method used to teach the skills is demonstration, followed by an opportunity to practice responding to scenarios presented. Learning to ask the type of questions which encourages another person to elaborate on their experience is the initial skill addressed in this unit. These are called, Exploratory responses and can be extremely valuable, encouraging others to talk about what is important to them. If we believe that people know much more about their interactions and perceptions than they acknowledge, then exploratory responses can aid in drawing this knowledge out. We asked the person to tell us rather than us telling them in the belief that they do, indeed, possess valuable knowledge and insight into their thoughts and feelings. Our task is to respectfully facilitate the discovery of this information. The listening response is the second skill presented in this first unit. Have you ever heard someone say, "You're just not listening to me," or have you ever been involved in a conversation with someone who seemed to be miles away? Listening is caring, showing respect. And it's more than making eye contact and not interrupting. Paraphrasing and clarifying are ways to communicate one's sincere desire to hear and understand another. If we believe that understanding is a basic need of all humans and especially of people who are troubled, then listening responses provide a vehicle to express our eagerness to understand the person we are talking with. Listening responses offered non-judgmentally, also provide the person with a mirror of what they have said. In a sense, listening closely to another also encourages them to listen more closely and fully to themselves and then, to evaluate the reasonableness of their statements and of their thoughts. Affect recognition and focus, the third skill in this unit, is a process of acknowledging our humanness with another by recognizing and naming our emotions. Helping put emotions into feeling words is important so that we can better know ourselves through language and learn to anticipate and if necessary, alter our reactions. In terms of our theories, we are literally informing one part of the brain about the content of other parts of the brain and body. In essence, becoming aware of our emotions, that aspect of our personality, which exerts the dominant influence on our behavior is critical. The final segment of the first unit is meta-communication recognition which involves acknowledging our mutual influences on each other, how we really feel about each other and what we want of each other. In fact, in the past, we've sometimes referred to this skill as honest labeling. Here, it's important to discover the embedded message, the unstated themes we sense going on between us and the other person. The subtle ways in which we attempt to influence each other and how we anticipate the other will react to us. The next unit, the second unit, is called affect simulation and is devoted to identifying and overcoming our interpersonal allergies to others by means of simulation. The process is looking at the bottom line fears I mentioned earlier that have us reacting defensively. You will view brief film segments, vignettes, in which a person on film will look directly at you and tell you things which are meant to stimulate an emotional reaction of some sort in you. The vignettes are derived from the theory about our fears of hurting and being hurt, engulfment and interpersonal distance. The film vignettes are viewed one at a time and your reactions to each are reviewed with the course instructor facilitating discussion. Later, you work in small groups, taking turns at the facilitator role. Next, you will work in pairs with one of you inquiring of the other about reactions to each vignette played. With some groups, physiological recordings of one's actual bodily reactions are added to the debriefing process. The three units which follow next, are based on the inquirer role. I'd like to take an extra few minutes here to describe it. After your first experience on self study recall session or seen films of recall sessions, you will have an opportunity to learn this all important role. The inquirer role is the most essential part of IPR because it is not just the process of videotape, but the way in which a tape is reviewed that makes IPR unique. Inquirer training, using a demonstration film, which contains simulation practice, is designed to enable you to learn this essential IPR tool which you'll need in order to later review recorded sessions for each other. The inquirer's role is built on the expectation that all people-

NORMAN KAGAN  -have encyclopedic knowledge of their interactions which can be brought to awareness. It's this respect for the knowledge of the individual, together with the specific skills used by the inquirer that makes IPR powerful and relevant in any culture and in any profession. The history of the development of the inquirer role may help you better understand it. The role was first hit upon when I had an opportunity to invite eminent psychologists to speak to an institute that I conducted in the fall of 1962. The lectures were video recorded and videotape was such a new process at that time that the visitors were eager to review their recording. After they had watched the few minutes of the tape, a sense of self-confrontation usually emerged. That is, they viewed themselves as others might view them and they found behaviors in themselves to critique. However, with a non-judgmental junior colleague, myself, not joining in their self-criticism, the recall process ensued in which they acknowledged covert thoughts and feelings of which they were only semi- aware at the time the recording was made. Throughout, my role in keeping with the propriety of the situation, I mean, after all these people were not my students or supervisees, was that of respectful inquirer. The next experience, which further molded the inquirer role, was research into the thoughts and feelings of people who had agreed to be videotaped for research purposes. As part of the research, we had to find a way to encourage them to talk about their thoughts and feelings. But it was important for the research that the subjects interpret their own thoughts and feelings with encouragement but not interpretation by the inquirers. It was during these studies that the power and potential of the inquirer role became evident. An analogy which I find useful in understanding the inquirer's role is that of an anthropologist studying a newly discovered culture. The anthropologist would not debrief members of that culture by attempting to interpret their own culture to them nor would the anthropologist ask only such global questions as, "Tell me about your culture." Rather, the anthropologist knows that the characteristics-

NORMAN KAGAN The anthropologist's inquiries are designed to encourage the members of the culture to describe the important information in each of these probable content areas. For instance, one of the questions might be, " What is your people's understanding of their origin?" Or another might be, " Are there times in a person's life when they're allowed to do things which they're not allowed to do ah, before that?" And so on. What then, would be the psychological equivalent of the anthropologist's cultural categories?

NORMAN KAGAN When people interact, they have thoughts and feelings, aspirations and anticipations . They have visual images and memories. They have degrees to which they wish to reveal themselves and have others revealed to them. They sense these reactions in themselves and in the other with whom they are interacting. In a recall session, when a person stops the tape to comment, the inquirer then encourages elaboration through questions designed to open these categories of probable content. The inquirer's questions are the psychological equivalent of the anthropologist's questions. Now, let's go on and look at the three remaining units. Each of the three is based on the recall process and the role of the inquirer. By the way,-

NORMAN KAGAN - the term "Interviewer" is used to mean therapist, supervisor, consultant, friend, anyone in the role of helper. And "Client" refers to patient, supervisee, the person receiving help. The "Inquirer", as we have said, is the person who helps us review our tapes. The first of the last three units is interviewer recall. An audio or videotape of an interaction is followed by recall only of the interviewer. When we go through this unit as interviewers, the purpose of the experience is to make our perceptions explicit, available and more subject to the influence of our own control. We believe that each interviewer has incredible knowledge about the interaction, which they only, or only semi-aware of. And during the recall, we encourage them to put into words their intuition, or that which they already know by virtue of being essentially communal animals. During this unit, we also have the opportunity to view ourselves as our own models. That is, to say aloud what we had thought of saying but didn't. A second chance, vicarious opportunity to hear ourselves say what we had considered saying, but didn't, an unusual, extremely valuable chance to try out and test new behaviors of our own design. The next unit is referred to as client recall and it's based on the recall of the client. Here, you have a chance to learn about the helping process from an unimpeachable source, the client. In client recall, we learn how we are perceived by the client, the person we're listening to and tell well our attempts to understand and communicate are received. For their part, the clients learn about the stress and strain and the rewards of being helped. One of the inevitable findings is that regardless of the content being discussed, much of our energy is focused on how we feel about each other. And this leads then, naturally, to the next unit. The last of the basic recall units is called mutual recall. It is an audio or videotape based recall session in which both recorded participants tell each other what they thought, felt and wanted of each other during the previously recorded interaction. The mutual recall process usually brings to the surface information on how the participants had mutually influenced each other, the meta- communication of the interaction. The mutual recall process not only helps you recognize and put this meta-communication into words, but it also gives you practice in discussing your interaction directly with the person you interact with. This is difficult to learn in other ways. Incidentally, most often, it's through the subtle meta-communication that we make our interpersonal nightmares or self-fulfilling prophecies happen. Throughout the entire series, you'll view candid films made of counselors, psychotherapists, physicians, supervisors, families, couples and classroom sessions in which interviewer recall, client recall or mutual recall was also filmed. Finally, exercises to encourage transfer of learning to life or career-relevant settings are assigned. Medical students interview volunteer patients who have recently had medical care. Counselors interview someone seeking help with the concern appropriate for the counselor's level of training. Law students interview clients or review recorded mock trials. And teachers are encouraged to try the recall process with an entire classroom around a recorded class session. So, there you have the theory and the description of the model. I hope that the IPR course will be interesting to you and worth the time you devote to it.
