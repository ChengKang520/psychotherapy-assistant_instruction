MICROTRAINING ASSOCIATES (888)505-5576 www.emicrotraining.com The Psychology of Racism and Antiracism A Four Lecture Series by Derald Wing Sue, Ph.D What Does It Mean To Be White? The Invisible Whiteness of Being 

00:00:00
DERALD WING SUE  Okay, welcome to our lecture series on The Psychology of Racism and Antiracism. My name is ah, Derald Wing Sue. Today's topic of which ah, ah, creates a consider amount of interest is, What does it mean to be White? The Invisible Whiteness of Being. Ah, recently, in a series of interviews, uhm, in ah, San Francisco, California, ah, while on sabbatical, I was doing a study ah, dealing with issues of racism, antiracism and asking people, "What does it mean to be White?" This is a question I want all of you to ask yourself as well because recently, there's considerable interest in understanding what whiteness is all about because it's so confusing to many people. Let me by, begin by giving you a number of responses to passerbys in, ah, San Francisco when I asked them this question. You can follow this on PowerPoint that we will hopefully be inserting into the tape here or in the handouts that will be given to you by your instructor. 

00:01:25
DERALD WING SUE This response comes from a 42-year-old White businessman. The question: What does it mean to be White? Ah, Answer: "Frankly, I don't know what you're talking about!" Aren't you White? "Yes, but I come from Italian heritage. I'm Italian, not White." Well then, what does it mean to be Italian? "Pasta, good food, love of wine." The man becomes agitated at this point. "This is getting ridiculous!" If we look at this dialogue that occurred between uhm, uhm, ah, in, in terms of the interview here, there is several themes and your instructor might wish to discuss this with his entire class here. But there is befuddlement and indeed the ah, person seems baffled by the question. A second theme that we have here is obviously one of denial or the appearance of being conflicted about being White. Ah, the person claims Italian heritage but indicates only a very superficial understanding of ethnic meaning. Ah, and lastly, he expresses annoyance and irritation at the question. And it really is a very interesting uhm, ah, question that we can ask about why this individual is irritated and frustrated or annoyed at the question itself. Something that I want you to discuss and think about carefully. 

00:02:55
DERALD WING SUE This response comes from a 26-year-old white, female college student. What does it mean to be White? "Is this a trick question? I've never thought about it. Well, I now that lots of Black people see us as being prejudiced and all that stuff. I wish people would just forget about race differences and see one another as human beings. People are people and we should all be proud to be Americans." Now again, what themes occur as a result of this dialogue? Well, one of the themes is that the person obviously has never thought about her whiteness or what it means to be White. There is a sense of defensiveness ah, or a prejudicial association with her whiteness and she desires to eliminate or in some sense dilute the race differences by saying that people are people and everyone should be an American. 

00:03:55
DERALD WING SUE Now, here's a third ah, response from a 65-year-old White, male, retired construction worker. What does it mean to be White, I asked. "That's a stupid question." Why? "Look, what are you... Oriental? You people are always blaming us for stereotyping and here you are doing the same to us." When you say "us", whom are you referring to? "I'm referring to Americans who aren't colored. We are all different from one another. I'm Irish but there are Germans, Italians and those Jews. I get angry at the colored people for always blaming us. When my grandparents came over to this country, they worked 24 hours a day to provide a good living for their kids. My wife and I raised five kids and I worked every day of my life to provide for them. No one gave me nothing! I get angry at the Black people for always whining. They just have to get off their butts and work rather than going on welfare. At least you people, and this is in reference to uhm, ah, Asian Americans work hard. The Black ones could learn from you people." Now, this is a very interesting type of ah, ah, response because there are several important themes that we will refer to throughout this ah, ah, presentation. One of them is that the person, the construction worker believes that the question stereotypes Whites and expresses considerable resentment at being ca, categorized. Secondarily, he tends to avoid seeing whiteness but tends to prefer seeing ethnic ah, identification; ah, as ethnic groups rather than ah, indeed ah, White. Thirdly, he expresses belief that anyone can be successful in our society if they work hard enough. There is an implication here that Asian Americans work very hard and are successful but that Blacks are lazy and in some sense, unsuccessful because they don't work hard enough. And there is strong anger here directed at ah, a visible, what I call visible racial ethnic minorities and a tendency to blame the victim. In other words, if you work hard enough, you succeed. If you don't do well in the society it's because of some intrinsic characteristic that you have. 

00:06:25
DERALD WING SUE  This comes, this response comes from a 34-year-old White, female stockbroker. What does it mean to be White? "I don't know." She begins to laugh. "I've never thought about it." Are you White? "Yes, I suppose so." Why haven't you thought about it? "Because it's not important to me." Why not? "It doesn't enter into my mind because it doesn't affect my life. Besides, we are all individuals. Color isn't important." Now, these themes again, tend to be repetitive in the sense that the person obviously has never thought about her whiteness and considers whiteness as unimportant and tends to see that people are individuals as opposed to being racial uhm, ah, ethnic groups. Now, these ideas and responses are not a typical for many White individuals to give when asked the question, "What does it mean to be White?" Indeed, there is quite a befuddlement as I indicated earlier or confusion about what the question means. Now, what I have found however, is that if I posed this identical question to people of color, we get a different perspective or different world view. There is no hesitation in terms of talking about what whiteness means. 

00:07:55
DERALD WING SUE So, on this case here, this is a 29-year-old Latina Administrative Assistant that I stopped in the middle of the street to ask: What does it mean to be White? "I'm not White. I'm Latina." Are you upset with me, I asked. "No, it's just that I'm light, so people always think I'm White. It's only when I speak that they realize I'm Hispanic." Well, what does it mean to be White, I asked, "Do you really want to know? Okay, it means you're always right. It means that you never have to explain yourself or apologize. You know that movie, 'Love Is Never Having To Say You're Sorry?' Well, being White is never having to say you're sorry. It means you think you're better than us." Now, again, this Latina fe, ah, ah, Latina tends to have several themes in terms of her expressions here. One of them is that she does have a strong ah, association or reaction for being mistaken as White and it would be interesting for us to explore that. Ah, two, ah, she claims that being White makes people who are White feel superior and this is reflected in their disinclination to admit in some sense they are wrong. 

00:09:15
DERALD WING SUE Now, this response I got from a uhm, 39-year-old Black, male salesman. What does it mean to be White? "Is this a school exercise or something?" he asked. "Never expected someone to ask me that question in the middle of the city. Do you want the politically correct answer or what I really think?" Can you tell me what you really think? "You won't quit, will you?" He begins to chuckle. "If you're White, you're right. If you're Black, step back." What does that mean, I asked. "White folks are always thinking they know all the answers. A Black man's word is worth less than a White man's. When White customers come into our dealership and see me standing next to the cars, I become invisible to them. Actually, they may see me as a well-dressed janitor or actively avoid me. They will search out White salesman, or when I explain something to a customer, they always check out the information with my White colleagues. They don't trust me. When I mention this to our manager, who is White, he tells me I'm oversensitive and being paranoid. That's what being White means. It means having the authority or power to tell me what's really happening even though I know it's not. Being White means you can fool yourself into thinking that you're not prejudiced, when you are. That's what it means to be White." Now, this is a very strong statement by the ah, a Black man in response to that question. But there are several themes that is im, ah, are important for us to look at. One of them is that he, he tends to indicate that being White means you view minorities as less competent and less capable. Second theme, is that White Americans have the power to define reality; such as that if the salesman was to complain about bias, in some sense, the White manager would tell him that he's paranoid or oversensitive. Ah, ah, thirdly, what he says, is that being White means you have the luxury of self-deception indicating that what is happening with respect to racial ethnic minorities is all in their mind and indeed are not reality or not actually true. 

00:11:45
DERALD WING SUE Now, this last response that I wanna read to you is from a 21-year-old Chinese-American male college student who is an Ethnics ah, Studies major and ah, this particular response really leads us to what we're going to be talking about ah, for the rest of this ah, ah, presentation that deals with that of White privilege. I asked: What does it mean to be White? He responds, "My cultural heritage class was just discussing that question this week." What was your conclusion, I asked. "Well, it has to do with White privilege. I read an article by a professor at Wellesley. It made a lot of sense to me. Being White in this society automatically guarantees you better treatment and unearned benefits and privileges than minorities. Having white skin means you have the freedom to choose the neighborhood you live in. You won't be discriminated against. When you enter a store, security guards won't assume you will steal something. You can flag down a cab without the thought that they won't pick you up because you're a minority. You can study in school and be assured your group will be portrayed positively. You don't have to deal with race or think about it." I asked, Are White folks aware of their White privilege? He answers, "Hell no! They're oblivious to it." Now, the themes that this young ah, man gives is that being White in some sense means having or possessing unearned privileges in our society. It means that the individual is oblivious to what their whiteness means to them in one sense or another. Thus I ask you the question in terms of these particular uhm, ah, responses to ask yourself, "What does it mean to be White?" Why is it so difficult for White Americans to acknowledge or see their whiteness? This is what I call the invisible whiteness of being. Because whiteness acts as a default standard by which we tend to uhm, ah, minimize the differences that we see. Now, the responses given by White Americans are radically different and this is something you might try in your classroom as well to ask people, uhm, but they are radically different from people of color. White respondents would generally not prefer, would rather not think about their whiteness. They tend to be uncomfortable or react negatively to being labeled "White". Why is that so? They deny its importance in affecting their lives. We had many situations of this with the dialogues that I read in which individuals said, "It doesn't matter to me. It doesn't affect me. It's unimportant in my life." Ah, and many White Americans seem to believe that they are unjustifiably accused of being bigoted by virtue of being White. 

00:15:00
DERALD WING SUE Now, one of the factors that I want to ah, ah, talk about is that, why or what is the psychological dynamics that leads individual to dilute or dismiss racial cultural differences ah, in some sense or ignore seeing differences. I have three groups of sayings that I want you to think about in terms of what their psychological implications are. Ah, a group saying No.1: "People are people." "We are all human beings." "We're all Americans." "We're all the same under the skin." Much of this is unarguable, is it? Group No.2 sayings: "We should emphasize our similarities, not our differences." "I don't see color at all." "We should be a color-blind society." "Everyone should be treated the same." "We should all learn to blend in." "If you immigrate to this country, you should assimilate and acculturate." "When in Rome, do as the Romans do." "We are a melting pot." 

00:16:10
DERALD WING SUE Now, like all familiar sayings, sayings that I've heard frequently, ah, these are, have meaning and truth at some level but they also have antagonistic, underlying ah, ah, meanings to themselves as well. For example, Group No.1, "People are people." Ah, I respond by saying, "Yes, stressing commonalities is important but doesn't mean that differences are bad, deviant and wrong. Indeed, when people make this statement oftentimes it seems like that is what they are, are saying. Ah, another ah, response to that first group of statement is that, "Yes, we are all the same under the skin and human, human beings but strangely enough, being human, being an American is generally defined from a White perspective." Something that we will talk about uhm, uhm, very shortly. Now, what about the group of sayings that say, "We should emphasize our similarities, not ah, our differences. "Uhm, I respond by saying this, "Yes, differences can ah, prove divisive but isn't it related more to how people perceive differences rather than the differences themselves?" For example, it isn't skin color that is the problem. It's society's perception of skin color that constitutes the problem. In other words, being Asian-American, being African-American, being ah, Latino-American or Native American is not the problem; we are not problem people. It is society's perception of those racial ethnic categories that ah, ah, that serve as the problems. And yes, we should treat everyone the same especially if differential treatment is discriminatory in nature. 

00:18:05
DERALD WING SUE  But can treating everyone the same result in unfairness? That's what I ask you because sometimes equal treatment tends to be prejudicial treatment or discriminatory treatment. What racial ethnic minorities are asking for is not so much equal treatment, it's equal access and opportunity. Equal access and opportunity oftentimes dictates differential treatment. This is another issue that we will talk about in the third lecture tapes about what we can do to overcome our racism and bias. And the third, ah, group of questions important for us to look at, which is, we should all learn to blend in if you immigrate this country, to this country, we should all blend in and acculturate and assimilate. And this goes to the heart of the melting pot concept. I respond to this by, "Yes, it is important to learn the language and culture of the society you reside in but shouldn't be at the cost of losing your cultural heritage and ethnic identification?" Secondarily, I ask you that if we truly believe in acculturation and assimilation and the melting pot concept, should we all not be American-Indians? And that is something that I want you to seriously think about. The fact that ah, if we believe truly in acculturation and assimilation, we should indeed be a uhm, ah, be American-Indians or Native Americans. The fact that we are not, indicates in some sense what we talk about when we deal with political uhm, ah, oppression. 

00:19:55
DERALD WING SUE Now, I have come to increasingly understand the hidden meaning of these statements. In most cases, there is an implicit equation that a human being is one who is White. I gave examples of this in the first tape that we had, that oftentimes people will compliment me on my good English or people will ask me over and over where I was born expecting for me to say that I was born in one of the Asian countries. These tend to, in some sense, communicate to me that I am still perceived as an alien in my own country. So, in ah, essence, what I seem to experience is that most White Americans continue on an unconscious, unintentional level to see Americans or human beings as White, blue-eyed or fair skinned in some sense. Now, the speaker usually who emphasizes uhm, ah, similarities and avoid seeing color differences are generally saying something like this, "Differences are divisive, so let's avoid acknowledging them and seek out our commonalities. I'm uncomfortable with racial differences so let's pretend they don't exist. To keep me comfortable, just pretend to be White". That indeed is what uhm, I, I think is happening here. Color blindness uses whiteness as I have said earlier as a default key and represents what I consider to be a racially motivated defense. Now, what do I mean by this? 

00:21:40
WHITENESS AND COLOR BLINDNESS AS A DEFAULT KEY - The pretense by White Americans of not seeing color is motivated by the need to appear free of bias and prejudice, fears that what they say or do may appear racist, or an attempt to cover up hidden biases. - To be color blind not only denies the central importance of racial differences in the psychological experience of minorities (racism and discrimination), but also allows the White person to deny how his or her whiteness intrudes upon the person of color. 

00:21:40
DERALD WING SUE I think that White Americans avoid seeing color because they are motivated to not appear biased, prejudiced or bigoted. They fear that what they say or what they do might appear to be racist, sexist, homophobic to others in the ah, ah, around them. Or they attempt to hidden up or ah, to cover up or ah, hide their ah, ah, biases. To be color blind, not only denies the central importance of racial differences in the psychological experiences of persons of color but it also allows many White Americans to deny how their whiteness intrudes upon racial ethnic minorities. Let me give you an example of this. I have oftentimes, while working in educational or school systems, frequently heard teachers admonish Black students asking them to leave their cultural baggage at the door of their classroom, don't bring your cultural baggage ah, into ah, ah, our classroom here. They have livi, little awareness that they bring their whiteness however, into the classroom and operate from a predominantly White ethnocentric perspective. I wonder what they would say if I was to ah, say to them why don't you leave your White cultural baggage outside of the classroom. And this is something that I think we need to look at ah, ah, quite dif, ah, ah, carefully. Now this brings me to an idea and understanding of what I call the invisibility of whiteness and the implications it has for White privilege. 

00:23:30
DERALD WING SUE  Now, let me define for you what White privilege is. White privilege is the unearned advantages and benefits that accrue to White folks by virtue of a system normed on the experiences, the values, the beliefs and perceptions of that group. White Privilege has five underlying characteristics. One of them is that it automatically confers dominance to one group, while subordinating groups of color in a descending relational hierarchy. A second characteristic of White privilege is that it owes its existence to White supremacy. Now I know I'm pu, pushing buttons in, in people, but you cannot have White privilege without White supremacy. They go hand in hand with one another. A third characteristic of White privilege is that it is premised on the mistaken notion of individual meritocracy and deservingness such as hard work, family values etcetera, rather than favoritism. Again this is difficult for people to ah, ah, understand but it is not maybe so much ah, that you deserve it and merit it through your hard work, but it is favoritism. White privilege is deeply also embedded in the structural, systemic and cultural workings of U.S. society. And that's what makes it so invisible and we will talk about this po, ah, policies, practices and structures that differentially discriminate against individuals of color. And fifth, it operates within an invisible veil of unspoken and protected secrecy. That is that as long as we're not aware of White privilege, we can deceive ourselves into the belief that we earned our status in this society and this life. 

00:25:40
DERALD WING SUE Now White privilege is com, coming, becoming ah, a taboo topic for White folks in our society. Uhm, it is an unacknowledged ah, secret and it protects many of you from realizing that you benefit from racism. This is really a difficult thing for many White folks to understand, that they benefit from White privilege and as a result, since it is intertwined with White supremacy, and it results in biased bigoted behavior, in some sense you are responsible for also what happens to individuals. The invisible nature of White privilege serves to keep White Americans comfortable, confident and relatively oblivious to how it has the opposite effect upon persons of color. It harms us. It intimidates us, oppresses us, alienates and makes us disca, ah, uncomfortable. Making the invisible visible is indeed the first step towards dismantling White privilege and White supremacy or in some sense beginning to understand the unfair nature of White privilege. 

00:26:55
DERALD WING SUE  Now let's first of all talk about these five characteristics of White privilege individually before we begin to ah, ah, talk about what we can do to overcome them. Now the first one is that it automatically confers dominance ah, on White folks vers, and, and ah, ah, tends to ah, facilitate the belief that I made it on my own. Because we live in a society that is normed and standardized on White Euro-American values and structures ah, at, in our institutions, we are, they, it is situated, White privilege is situated in such a way as to pave the road for White folks but, we, erecting barriers to persons of color. The United States continues really, if you look at it on a truthful way, to favor White Eurocentric ways of thinking, acting and being that does not match the racial reality of persons of color. Ah, in, res, in this respect two sides of the same coin operate when we talk about ah, automatically confers dominance. On the one side White privilege automatically confers dominance, control and power to White Americans, but on the other side it automatically disempowers and oppresses people of color. On the one side it automatically advantages one group, but on the other side it automatically disadvantages another. Ah, a colleague of mine uhm, ah, Peggy McIntosh, a former ah, Wellesley ah, ah, researcher, in her article "White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack", makes this point as well. Let me read to you a quote. "As a White person, I realized I have been taught about racism as something which puts others at the disadvantage but have been taught not to see one of its corollary aspects; White privilege which puts me on an advantage." She came to this understanding. She worked for the Women's Studies Department at Wellesley College. During that time, she mentioned that she had interactions with many of her uhm, ah, White male colleagues. And she would ah, ah, she would try to convince them that by virtue of being a man, that in some sense they were advantaged but by her being a woman she was disadvantaged in the society. She found an interesting psychological dynamic, that is; that men were willing to admit and acknowledge the fact that by virtue of gender in this society, a person is disadvantaged. But they were, did not want to acknowledge the fact or had great difficulty acknowledge the fact that by virtue of being a man in this society they were advantaged and privileged. She said that, "When I began to talk to other women of color I noticed a very similar dynamic that often times they would tell me ah, when I ah, would tell them, that ah, yes I could understand how being a Black person in this society, you are ah, a disadvantaged and discriminated against." She said that many of the uhm, ah, White women however could not understand uhm, ah, when, when she would talk to, when, when, uh, ah, her, ah, women of color would say to her that by virtue of your skin color being White even though you're a woman you are advantaged. She said, "I got, became very defensive and fought this until I made the association with my interactions with uhm, ah, my White male colleagues." And this is what is very important here. Most of us would acknowledge that persons of color, women, gay, lesbians, the disabled and other marginalized groups are often put in a disadvantaged positions. Most of us would further admit I think, that being a racial minority in this society, subjects you to second-class status. Yet it is intriguing that most White Americans would actively deny that they are advantaged by this state of affairs. The example I go back to is the Black salesman that I read to you. His presence, he is disadvantaged because ah, White customers do not seek him out of, ah, for sales when he provides information in some sense they always check, check it out with the ah, White salesman. Now it, not only is he disadvantaged by making perhaps less sales, but in some sense he must deal with the constant invalidation of his own self-image that I am a worthy salesperson. Now what about the White sales people in the ah, ah, show room? First of all, they don't realize that because the African-American salesman is making less sales, they are making more sales. They are advantaged by this state of affairs. Secondarily, they are constantly reinforced and believe that indeed they are superior salesman because their sales are higher. And this is something that I want all of you to see that the deception resides in the belief by many White Americans that the superior outcome, the sales, reflects their individual efforts; that they made it on their own. And because White folks tend to see racism as only individual acts of meanness, they seldom consider that an invisible system of White privilege has automatically set the situation up where they are in control, in dominance and the outcome will favor them. The system protects unfair individual acts of racial dominance through denying their race related meanings. The Black salesman is told that race had nothing to do with it, that he is over sensitive, that he's paranoid. And in some sense this is a very important issue. 

00:33:30
DERALD WING SUE Now characteristic number two of White privilege. Number two says that it exists on White supremacy versus I'm not responsible for the oppression of others. I would say again that White privilege could not exist without White supremacy. White supremacy, as a doctrine of racial superiority, that justifies discrimination, segregation and domination of persons of color, are based upon an ideology and belief system that considers all non-white groups inferior. They are manifested not just in acts of individual bias but also in the very institutional and cultural foundations of our society. Interestingly enough, ah, Pablo Freire, the author of "Pedagogy of the Oppressed", describes the ability of the dominant culture to control minorities through the ability to a fine, define both their identities and the roles that they play. Minorities he says, are defined as criminals, delinquents, untrustworthy, less intelligent, lacking moral character, primitive, uncivilized, prone to violence, alienate, aliens, illegal immigrants and on and on. The roles that they occupy defined by our society are that they are servants, housekeepers, janitors, or generally lower positions or occupations in our ah, society. Now to maintain this conformance and the silence of, of many individuals, White supremacy as a doctrine and belief, in, instilled to us, through the education and through the institutional policies and practices that punish those individual for raising this issue or voicing objections. The punishment isn't necessarily just economic or physical punishment. It can be punishment by isolation, by ridicule, by a number of other, ah, ah, factors. Now the educational system tends to teach us for example, that ah, Columbus discovered America, that the pioneers settled the west, that differences are deviant, that ah, belief in the myth of the melting pot ah, concept, positive portrayal of White folks, negative portrayal of minority groups that the internment of Japanese-Americans were not based on racism, but natural, ah, national security, and that Louise and Clark expedition gave U.S. claim to the Oregon territory. One noteworthy example of this ah, as an example of White supremacy was the Doctrine of Manifest Destiny. An argument in the 1840's that said all land owned by Native Americans, were decreed by God to the be, belong to White folks. Now this irrational sense of entitlement is a dominant feature of White privilege and it is very insidious. When my White brothers and sisters for example, claim that they should not blame, be blamed for the past actions of their ancestors, such as taking land away from the American Indians, enslaving ah, ah, Black folks from Africa or taking away the lands of Japanese-Americans during Wor, ah, World War II, they miss really a vital, important point. They still benefit from the past injustices of their forebears. Even if White Euro-Americans are completely free of conscious racial prejudices and desire to forgo or disclaim White privilege, they still benefit automatically and unintentionally. If you are a white person, hailing a cab, that cab will stop for you. If you are a person of color trying to hail a cab, they may, 25 percent of the time; according to one study in New York City, cab drivers will pass you. Now, you may not be a racist or a bigoted ah, but in some sense you still unintentionally benefit from this particular uhm, ah, action. 

00:37:55
DERALD WING SUE The third ah, ah, characteristic of ah, White ah, privilege is that It is predicated on favoritism rather than meritocracy. You know, we often times hear that the most qualified individual ought to get the job. And one of the things that I was, uhm, ah, would give to you is a primary eg, ah, example, Molley Ivins, a ah, Austin ah, columnist uhm, in the Texas Newspaper, when George Bush was running for president, made the following ah, statement, "George Bush was born on third base but believes he hit a triple." Now, I want you to sit with that statement in terms of what it means, "George Bush was born on third base but believes he hit a triple." This statement really represents the ultimate illusion of White privilege of meritocracy. If we accept the concept of White privilege, then we have to entertain the notion that many White folks did not succeed because of superior ability but due to favoritism. George Bush did not become President of the United States solely because of hard work or superior intellect but he was born into a privileged family, given favored status by a White society, all his life attending the best schools, living in the best White neighborhoods, obtaining the best White jobs, having to deal only with the White police force and had opportunities not available to many people of color. If I use this baseball analogy, you know, that while George Bush was born on ba, ah, third base and might have worked hard to come home, that many persons of color don't even have an opportunity to make it to the batter's box. In the United States, our society is believed to have arose from the cherished belief of rugged individualism. It is part of the protestant ethic that believes there is a strong relationship between ability, effort and success. In other words, we believe that people who work hard uhm, who have superior intellect will succeed in our society. And those that don't succeed are either lazy, unintelligent or have ah, poor family values. Again, this is what we call, blaming the victim. Democratic ideals such as equal access and opportunities, everyone can make it in this society if they work hard enough, liberty and justice for all, God helps those that help their society are all factors that speak to our belief that people, the outcome of one's life is based upon individual effort and not due to ah, uhm, in, in some sense bias in the system. We believe in some sense that we are the master of our own faith. The problem with this is that we tend to blame the victim when we do not see the biased bigotry and the White privilege that prevents many people of color from succeeding here. There is a pur, a triple purpose to the existence of White privilege. One is to advantage White Americans, two is to divan, disadvantage persons of color and three, it is attempting to attribute the causes for individual deficiencies thereby relieving White society of perpet, of responsibility for perpetuating the inequities that we have. 

00:41:50
DERALD WING SUE  Characteristic number four of White privilege it is embedded in our society uhm, ah, as opposed to us saying that the cream of the crop rises to the top. What I'm saying here, is that, White privilege is not just confined to individual perceptions or actions of White Euro-Americans. Discriminatory benefits that favor Whites are seen in facets, all facets of our society: in bank lending practices, access to health care, housing, jobs, education, etcetera. It exists in what I call SOPS, S-O-P-S, Standard Operating Procedures of institutions in our ah, Society. This represents the rules, habits, procedures and structures of organizations that oppress certain groups while advantaging other groups. Let me read to you, and again this will be on the uhm, ah, on the power point here ah, of some of these factors that affect disparities: systemic societal forces that produce segregation allowing only certain groups to purchase homes in affluent neighborhoods resulting in the differential worth of real estate, bank lending practices that consider credit worthiness on the basis of location inevitably discriminating against minority communities, inequitable school financing in which property taxes of wealthy communities produce greater educational resources than poor communigate, ah, poor communities, segregated schools that dispense inferior education to one group but advantaged education to another, biased curricula, textbooks and materials that reaffirm the identity of one group while denigrating others, educational testing that is normed and standardized at White middle-class populations resulting in totally biased, ah, instruments, hiring policies and practices that utilize the old boys' network. Now, these are all what I call, Standard Operating Procedures that are deeply embedded in our society and culture.

DERALD WING SUE  Let us go to characteristic number five. The unspoken and protected secrecy. The invisible whiteness of being maintains its viability precisely because it is a protected ah, and seldom spoken secrecy. In 1972, Ralph Ellison wrote the book "The Invisible Man", that describes Invisible Man's Syndrome where racial issues and color are deluded, ignored or considered irrelevant. Many White Americans however, have uhm, ah, originally formulated the concept of color blindness was seen as an answer to discrimination and prejudice. For example, Martin Luther King for example, advocating judging people not by the color of their skin but by their internal characteristics. Many White Americans however have distorted or conveniently used color blindness as a means of color denial or more accurately, power denial. Much of what White Americans have attained ah, is unearned and due to White privilege.

DERALD WING SUE Let me read to you a statement by, Robert Jensen, a White professor of journalism. I know I did not get where I am by merit alone. I benefited from, among other things, White privilege. This doesn't mean that I don't deserve my job, or that I weren't White, if I weren't White I would've never gotten the job. It means simply that all through my life, I have soaked up benefits for being White. I grew up in a fertile farm country taken by force from non-white indigenous people. I was educated in a well-funded, virtually all-White public school system in which I learned that White people like me made this country great. There I was taught a variety of skills, including how to take standardized tests written by and for White people. There're certainly is individual variation in experiences. Some White people have had it easier than me, probably because they came from wealthy families that gave them even more privilege. Some White people have had it tougher than me because they came from poorer families. White women face discrimination I will never know. But, in the end, White people all have drawn on White privilege somewhere in their lives." Now, I would like to end this presentation by telling you and asking you, how do we get White privilege out of the closet? Why is it resisted and fought for in this way? There are three reasons that I want you to think about and consider, one of them I call the White Out Phenomenon. White privilege mimics the norms of fairness justice and equity by whiting out differences and perpetuating the belief in sameness. The denial of power imbalance, unearned privilege and racist domination is often times couched in the rhetoric of equal treatment and equal opportunity. Uhm, two, there is almost a, a conspiracy of silence. As long as White society view racism, unfairness and discrimination as residing only in individual acts and that they did not overtly discriminate or consciously condone private acts of racism, they can alleviate guilt and responsibility for their own ah, ah, ah, existence. And lastly, White privilege, ah, lit, ah, is characterized by living in a false White reality. White Americans have the dep, ability to define reality and as a result, this is one of the greatest difficulties that people of color have. In terms of trying to get people to realize that the reality of people of color are equally valid to consider.

DERALD WING SUE  Now, in closing, let me talk about what I see as the exploration into uhm, whiteness and White privilege. What does it mean to be White? Let me try to answer this and I know and realize that I will be pushing buttons in all of you. But that is good, I think that if we're too comfortable with these issues, then we aren't advancing and growing. What does it mean to be White? To be White means to be socialized into a world of White supremacy. What does that mean? To be White means to inherit and benefit from White privilege something that I've been talking about throughout this presentation. To knowingly or unknowingly have a stake in the perpetuation of White racism. And again your buttons are being pushed uhm, ah, in terms of that. But like, as I was saying White privilege exists primarily because of White supremacy. Denying, uhm, ah, to be White means that often times, to deny the reality of people of color and defining it from a White perspective. Just like the manager to the Black salesmen, telling them that they're over sensitive and that what they're seeing is not truly uhm, ah, what's happening. This is a uhm, ah, dilemma placed upon many individuals of color. To be White often times means that you have the luxury ah, of not exploring or acknowledging your own biases and prejudices. To be White often times mean that you unintentionally assume that you are right in your perception of the situation. To be White means to posses the luxury of not exploring yourself as racial cultural beings. Every day of my life I know that I am an Asian-American and very few of my White brothers and sisters for example will get up in the morning, look in the mirror and say something that, "Gees I'm White. But I do when I look in the mirror. "Ah, being White means to be able to equate a human being with being White. Being White means ah, responsibility in the oppression ah, of people of color. Being White more importantly means that in some sense this society attempts to uhm, ah, place you in a situation of self-deception. I hope that you have ah, understood many of the points that I've uhm, ah, I've been trying to communicate to you ah, today and I look forward to our third uhm, ah, lecture series in which I will begin to talk about, what can White Americans do to begin to make the invisible visible? Thank you very much.
