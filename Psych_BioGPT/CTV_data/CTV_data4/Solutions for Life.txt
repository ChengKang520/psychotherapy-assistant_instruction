Brief Counseling Solutions For Life Living with Physical Challenge John Littrell with Daisy Roman 

00:00:00
JOHN LITTRELL  I'm John Littrell and we're going to be engaged in about a 45-minute videotape on brief counseling. And during that time I'm going to use more of a problem-solving brief counseling approach and we're gonna be looking at problem, attempted solutions, goals and ways to help Daisy get to those goals. And hope that this is, ah, nice illustration of what brief counseling is all about. 

00:00:40
Stage 1: Structuring and Rapport Stage 3: Defining Goals Search For Client Goals 

00:00:40
JOHN LITTRELL  Curious(ph) you know, having dealt with that loss,- (crosstalk) 

00:00:50
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:00:50
JOHN LITTRELL - and that, that process and at this moment what are the challenges of that for you and what is it that you'd like to change if anything,- (crosstalk) 

00:01:00
DAISY ROMAN Hmm. 

00:01:00
JOHN LITTRELL - about, kind of who you are, and the direction that you're going? 

00:01:05
DAISY ROMAN Hmm, you know the challenges that, that I'm facing today and recently, for example, and I had a, a psychological test done to me because I have not been able to concentrate well since fibromyalgia and sometimes I do and sometimes I'm not able to and reading just one page can take me for a long time and- (crosstalk) 

00:01:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:01:30
DAISY ROMAN - I couldn't just so easily space out and then not being able to be there and ah, so I had, I have requested this test and it was and provided to me and the result was that, in fact, I'm not able to concentrate- (crosstalk) 

00:01:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:01:45
DAISY ROMAN - and that was and, even though I, I knew to have to hear it from somebody else and I have the results to really tell me, "Yes, you are- (crosstalk) 

00:02:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:02:00
DAISY ROMAN - right," that was a reality that I had- (crosstalk) 

00:02:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:02:00
DAISY ROMAN - to face and it was hard to accept. I thought that I had but. 

00:02:05
Paraphrase, Reflection of Feeling 

00:02:05
JOHN LITTRELL So you had told yourself in some ways you've knew in your own body- (crosstalk) 

00:02:10
DAISY ROMAN Hmm. 

00:02:10
JOHN LITTRELL - that that was the case but that somehow evidence from outside- (crosstalk) 

00:02:15
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:02:15
JOHN LITTRELL - confirmed it and that's, that's kinda hard, that was hard to take. 

00:02:20
DAISY ROMAN Yes, yes it is and, and with that and the fear of what else is fibromyalgia going to bring- (crosstalk) 

00:02:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:02:30
DAISY ROMAN - my way and ah, I, I know how strong I have become and sometimes I wonder, "Would I be this strong forever- (crosstalk) 

00:02:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:02:40
DAISY ROMAN - to face the challenges of fibromyalgia?" And, uhm. 

00:02:45
JOHN LITTRELL So, more almost kinda does, you look to your future, what's going to happen? Where am I going to be? What's this, how is this going to affect my life? 

00:02:55
DAISY ROMAN Yes. 

00:02:55
JOHN LITTRELL Will I be as strong in the future as I have been up to this point, and things that I've been learning about myself? 

00:03:00
DAISY ROMAN Exactly, exactly. 

00:03:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:03:05
DAISY ROMAN And ah, it feels, it feels on challenging- (crosstalk) 

00:03:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:03:10
DAISY ROMAN - it is, it is so challenging- (crosstalk) 

00:03:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:03:15
DAISY ROMAN - and, ah, not only as, as a woman and as a student but as a parent- (crosstalk) 

00:03:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:03:20
DAISY ROMAN - a mother of two children. How would this affect them? 

00:03:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:03:25
DAISY ROMAN On. (crosstalk) 

00:03:25
JOHN LITTRELL So, it's not just you personally but it's also as a woman, as a parent,- (crosstalk) 

00:03:35
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:03:35
JOHN LITTRELL - the children? 

00:03:35
DAISY ROMAN Yes, yes. 

00:03:35
JOHN LITTRELL It's not just, "This is going to affect me in some ways but it's gonna affect other people also in some ways too." 

00:03:40
DAISY ROMAN  Yes, yes. And how I have learned to deal with that is, I'd, I used to before on, dread on the past and look into the future and the moment was just not there,- (crosstalk) 

00:03:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:03:55
DAISY ROMAN - that present was not. (crosstalk) 

00:03:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:03:55
DAISY ROMAN So, I have learned with uhm, fibromyalgia to be able to be here today- (crosstalk) 

00:04:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:04:00
DAISY ROMAN - and not to worry so much about the future. 

00:04:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:04:05
DAISY ROMAN And never mind about the past so it's about today and the moment. (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:04:10
DAISY ROMAN And sometimes I, I wake up and I'm able to take the whole day in my hands and be able to struggle and juggle everything and some days I just have to take it one minute at a time. 

00:04:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:04:20
Concretizing Goals 

00:04:20
JOHN LITTRELL  I'm gonna ask you, it may sound like a very strange question. How is, what we're talking about,- (crosstalk) 

00:04:30
DAISY ROMAN Hmm. 

00:04:30
JOHN LITTRELL - how is this problematic? 

00:04:35
DAISY ROMAN How is it problematic? (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:04:40
DAISY ROMAN I think that and, it has become and, a, a challenge. I guess that I'd, I do not use the word problematic. (crosstalk) 

00:04:45
JOHN LITTRELL  Okay. 

00:04:50
DAISY ROMAN And it has become a challenge because everyday becomes a challenge for me on what I will be facing and when I go to school and study, would I be able to concentrate? (crosstalk) 

00:05:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:05:00
DAISY ROMAN And I might be able to be and, a competent person in the field that I'm- (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:05:05
DAISY ROMAN - planning to go into? 

00:05:05
JOHN LITTRELL And this is time the expressions sort of you're almost like asking yourself questions- (crosstalk) 

00:05:10
DAISY ROMAN Yes. 

00:05:10
JOHN LITTRELL - about, how am I going to be able to do this? How am I going to handle this? 

00:05:15
DAISY ROMAN Yes. 

00:05:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uhm. 

00:05:15
DAISY ROMAN  And it, in, and when I'm, when I'm in my classes with my, with my classmates,- (crosstalk) 

00:05:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:05:25
DAISY ROMAN - I see them to be, to be able to grasp the and, the, the, the, the whole chapter and just, you know, so fast and- (crosstalk) 

00:05:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:05:35
DAISY ROMAN - be able to get instructions so fast and for me, you know, I'm kind of there trying to struggle with what is that I'm supposed to do next. 

00:05:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:05:40
DAISY ROMAN And, ah, I think that that, that is a challenge for me. (crosstalk) 

00:05:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:05:45
DAISY ROMAN I think that is a challenge to, to see how, how are my peers- (crosstalk) 

00:05:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:05:50
DAISY ROMAN - and, see me. And, ah, another challenge that I face is not wanting to tell everyone- (crosstalk) 

00:06:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:06:00
DAISY ROMAN - about what is and that, not because I do, not because I will feel less but because how different would they look at me- (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:06:10
DAISY ROMAN - and how different am I really. (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:06:10
DAISY ROMAN  So those, I guess that all of those, like this, they had the challenges come with all of those questions. 

00:06:20
The next question is important and focuses specifically on the client's goals. It is repeated twice in this tape for emphasis. 

00:06:20
JOHN LITTRELL  Change as it occurs, and you're moving in a direction that you'd like, how would it be different from what it is like, right now? 

00:06:35
JOHN LITTRELL Change as it occurs, and you're moving in a direction that you'd like, how would it be different from what it is like, right now? 

00:06:45
DAISY ROMAN  I guess that I like to talk more about on who I am and who, what is fibromyalgia and, and what part of fibromyalgia takes in my life. (crosstalk) 

00:07:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:07:00
DAISY ROMAN And being able to, to let others understand that, even though up to now I look different- (crosstalk) 

00:07:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:07:05
DAISY ROMAN - I am different in, in many ways. (crosstalk) 

00:07:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:07:10
DAISY ROMAN And I guess that that goes for everyone. You know, for every human being. (crosstalk) 

00:07:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:07:10
DAISY ROMAN But in terms of getting educated and, and become a professional,- (crosstalk) 

00:07:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:07:15
DAISY ROMAN - that is and, and, ah, the physical abilities- (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:07:20
DAISY ROMAN - I think that that is a difference that I have in my life. 

00:07:25
Summary, Confrontation 

00:07:25
JOHN LITTRELL So you would be letting more people in some ways, be aware or to be knowledgeable not just it sounds like for yourself but kind of about this whole disease? 

00:07:35
DAISY ROMAN Exactly, exactly. 

00:07:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:07:35
DAISY ROMAN  And ah. 

00:07:40
JOHN LITTRELL And right now, I've picked up as it seems like right now you, at times, sort of hesitant about doing that- (crosstalk) 

00:07:45
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:07:45
JOHN LITTRELL - uhm, but you still like to perhaps do that more but there is an ambivalence. 

00:07:55
Stages 4 and 5: Working on the Concern and Generalizing to the Real World Debriefing The Session 

00:07:55
JOHN LITTRELL  Stepping out of that for just a little bit,- (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:08:00
JOHN LITTRELL - uhm, what I guess are you aware of in terms of, as we were in counseling view point uhm, what was working for you, uhm, if there are questions that you had about other things that were not as con, or very confusing and that type of thing? Now, what was your response and impressions there? 

00:08:20
DAISY ROMAN  Well I, it's, first of all, I have to say that I felt, you know, for being in an interview that is being taped. (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:08:30
DAISY ROMAN And, I felt very comfortable- (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
JOHN LITTRELL Okay. 

00:08:30
DAISY ROMAN - and ah, I'd, I felt that a new tone of voice is, it is very comfortable for me to follow and feel maybe safe- (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:08:40
DAISY ROMAN - if, if, and, and I, I, the, the, the questions were I, I think that I cannot recall exactly the questions but there were few questions that, and a couple of questions that brought emotions for me. (crosstalk) 

00:09:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:09:05
DAISY ROMAN And, ah, and I think that one of the questions that struck me was, on, what do you find problematic, I think- (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:09:15
DAISY ROMAN - was the, and so, it was, that, that was, uhm, and kind of, ah, confusing. (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
DAISY ROMAN Ah question. (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
JOHN LITTRELL And I noticed you changed that to challenging. 

00:09:25
A problem-centered language can be a "problem." 

00:09:25
DAISY ROMAN Yes,- (crosstalk) 

00:09:25
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:09:25
DAISY ROMAN - yes. And I think that, perhaps I, I stopped using that word and I guess that I'd, without knowing and being aware,- (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:09:40
DAISY ROMAN - I have used challenge rather than- (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:09:40
DAISY ROMAN - problem. So, and, but, I'd- 

00:09:50
Rapport Discussion 

00:09:50
DAISY ROMAN - the sequence of the questions led me exactly to, you know, to the next step and brought answers for me. And, ah, and it was following and leading me into the next. (crosstalk) 

00:10:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:10:05
DAISY ROMAN And it was, I found it to be very interesting and very comfortable in- (crosstalk) 

00:10:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:10:10
DAISY ROMAN - in answering them. 

00:10:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:10:10
DAISY ROMAN And I think that on the posture and your eyes looking, looking at me and, ah, I think that everything was very, it felt, I felt very safe,- (crosstalk) 

00:10:25
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:10:25
DAISY ROMAN - very safe and very comfortable. 

00:10:25
JOHN LITTRELL  Anything you would have me do differently? 

00:10:30
DAISY ROMAN  And, gee, (giggles) on, not that I can think of, I think, that, on, I felt, ah, I sensed the respect that you had, and, with your posture, on the tone of voice, very sensitive. 

00:10:55
Nonverbal Cultural Issues 

00:10:55
DAISY ROMAN And I think that, and coming from on, the culture, on, from the culture of an, being a Puerto Rican. (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:11:05
DAISY ROMAN And, you were looking at me directly into my eyes. (crosstalk) 

00:11:10
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:11:10
DAISY ROMAN And I've been here for 18 years. So, I am used to that- (crosstalk) 

00:11:10
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:11:10
DAISY ROMAN - perhaps a person that hasn't lived here,- (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
JOHN LITTRELL Yeah. 

00:11:15
DAISY ROMAN - they, they would have felt a little bit uncomfortable- (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:11:15
DAISY ROMAN - and, perhaps. (crosstalk) 

00:11:15
JOHN LITTRELL  You didn't seem uncomfortable with that, as well? 

00:11:20
DAISY ROMAN No. (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
JOHN LITTRELL No. 

00:11:20
DAISY ROMAN No. So, on, but now, I feel very comfortable- (crosstalk) 

00:11:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:11:25
DAISY ROMAN - on the, with the whole interview. 

00:11:25
JOHN LITTRELL  Well, thank you very much- (crosstalk) 

00:11:30

00:11:30

00:11:35
DAISY ROMAN  Yes. There, there is because I guess that I still struggle with that. As I said, I have always been very determined and very independent. And I always struggled with whatever came my way- (crosstalk) 

00:12:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:12:20
DAISY ROMAN - and I'm doing that this time. But this time is about a limitation in my life that I have, have to accept- (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:12:30
DAISY ROMAN - and let others know that this is part and I'm still hesitant in letting know the story, hey, this is me, this is- (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:12:35
DAISY ROMAN - part of me. 

00:12:35
Confrontation 

00:12:35
JOHN LITTRELL And that sort of, determined, strong you,- (crosstalk) 

00:12:40
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:12:40
JOHN LITTRELL - and then on the other hand, I'm not feeling so strong, and how do I reconcile those two parts. 

00:12:50
DAISY ROMAN Exactly, exactly. So I think that I have put a balance of, on those two but I- (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:12:55
DAISY ROMAN - haven't met them together and haven't introduced them. Perhaps, just wishing that maybe one- (crosstalk) 

00:13:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:05
DAISY ROMAN - day, it will disappear. 

00:13:05
JOHN LITTRELL Let me just check then. You say that they're kind of like this- (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:13:10
What is client already doing right? 

00:13:10
JOHN LITTRELL - and that maybe some, what have been steps that you've taken to make those more already- (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
DAISY ROMAN Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
JOHN LITTRELL - together so that there's much more integration of, so that you become more whole in that process. 

00:13:25
DAISY ROMAN I think that, on, to be more, and, to accept, to be able to accept,- (crosstalk) 

00:13:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:35
DAISY ROMAN - yes, this is part of me,- (crosstalk) 

00:13:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:35
DAISY ROMAN - and, has been the, the key - (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:13:40
DAISY ROMAN - to, to my struggles. (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
JOHN LITTRELL And you've been doing some of that. 

00:13:40
DAISY ROMAN Yes. And, ah. 

00:13:45
Concreteness 

00:13:45
JOHN LITTRELL And how do you go about doing that? How do you start the, what do you do with that starts to bring those two? 

00:13:50
DAISY ROMAN I have learned to listen to my body,- (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:13:50
DAISY ROMAN - to, when I'm in pain, when I have the muscle spasm, when I have the headaches. What is it that I'm doing, when I'm pushing myself too far so I need to pull myself back- (crosstalk) 

00:14:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:14:00
DAISY ROMAN - to need, I need to listen to my body and what its telling me. And, ah. 

00:14:05
JOHN LITTRELL So already- (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
DAISY ROMAN  Yeah. 

00:14:10
JOHN LITTRELL - listening to your body. 

00:14:10
DAISY ROMAN Yes. 

00:14:10
JOHN LITTRELL What's my body telling me? 

00:14:10
DAISY ROMAN Yes. 

00:14:10
JOHN LITTRELL  And acting on that, it sounds like, then, too. 

00:14:15
DAISY ROMAN Yes. 

00:14:15
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. What else do you do that besides listening to your body and paying attention and doing something about that? 

00:14:30
DAISY ROMAN  To help on with fibromyalgia and myself meet- (crosstalk) 

00:14:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:14:35
DAISY ROMAN - together. 

00:14:35
JOHN LITTRELL  Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:14:40
DAISY ROMAN And, I'd, I have learned to, uhm, I guess that I don't know but, ah, you're referring to what things I've been doing in terms of I'd, I've done a lot of meditation- (crosstalk) 

00:14:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:14:55
DAISY ROMAN - to be able to, to work with that and to hold my, my body relaxed because one of the things with fibromyalgia is that even when you stop, your body keeps going and your brain and they do not shut down. So,- (crosstalk) 

00:15:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:15:05
DAISY ROMAN - it's educating the body to be able to do that. (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:15:10
DAISY ROMAN And ah, one of the. 

00:15:10
JOHN LITTRELL So, for instance, even right now,- (crosstalk) 

00:15:15
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:15:15
JOHN LITTRELL - are you relaxed? 

00:15:15
DAISY ROMAN No. It's, it's, it's, it takes a lot- (crosstalk) 

00:15:20
JOHN LITTRELL Okay. 

00:15:20
DAISY ROMAN - on trying to, I guess that it takes- (crosstalk) 

00:15:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:15:25
DAISY ROMAN - the, the stress but I guess that two years ago, I would have been, you know, very uncomfortable. (crosstalk) 

00:15:30
JOHN LITTRELL Okay. 

00:15:30
DAISY ROMAN So I guess that. 

00:15:30
Strength Emphasis 

00:15:30
JOHN LITTRELL So if we admitted you two years ago. 

00:15:35
DAISY ROMAN I wouldn't have been able to do this. (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh-huh. 

00:15:35
DAISY ROMAN Definitely not. And. 

00:15:40
JOHN LITTRELL So you think quite a bit of learning of listening to your body- (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
DAISY ROMAN Yes. 

00:15:40
JOHN LITTRELL - in those two years. 

00:15:45
DAISY ROMAN Yes. That has been. 

00:15:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:15:45
DAISY ROMAN And, ah, it's been, it's been wonderful, another thing that I do in my process of helping is to, and, learn how to direct myself when I am upset for whatever reasons. I have,- (crosstalk) 

00:16:00
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:16:00
DAISY ROMAN - a 17-year old who's an adolescent and we have a lot of disagreements- (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:16:05
DAISY ROMAN - and that can take a lot of energy from me. So, and then I feel so exhausted. (crosstalk) 

00:16:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
DAISY ROMAN So how can I then, and I cannot pause myself- (crosstalk) 

00:16:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:16:15
DAISY ROMAN - and before addressing any issues and then be prepared. And so prepare myself ahead of time,- (crosstalk) 

00:16:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:16:25
DAISY ROMAN - and to be able to, to confront whatever situation, whether its at home or outside or,- (crosstalk) 

00:16:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:16:30
DAISY ROMAN - so. 

00:16:30
JOHN LITTRELL But more almost pacing yourself using your energy that you have wisely- (crosstalk) 

00:16:35
DAISY ROMAN  Yes. 

00:16:40
JOHN LITTRELL - to be able to- (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
DAISY ROMAN Yes. 

00:16:40
JOHN LITTRELL - confront- (crosstalk) 

00:16:40
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:16:40
JOHN LITTRELL - at same time, help you to deal with those situations with your son. 

00:16:45
DAISY ROMAN  Yes. Yes. And I guess that the, the, the challenges come in all of those areas- (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:16:55
DAISY ROMAN - of, you know, my family, school and everywhere I go, you know, where we, what challenges am I- (crosstalk) 

00:17:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:00
DAISY ROMAN - going to face and how am I going to deal with them. (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:05
DAISY ROMAN And, and even though I'm, I'm learning and educating myself, I will be dealing with other people- (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:10
DAISY ROMAN - that perhaps will not be that understanding. (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:15
DAISY ROMAN So how do I get myself to, perhaps, talk more about fibromyalgia,- (crosstalk) 

00:17:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:20
DAISY ROMAN - and, and, ah, get fibromyalgia and Daisy- (crosstalk) 

00:17:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:25
DAISY ROMAN - to meet together- (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
JOHN LITTRELL Ah. 

00:17:30
DAISY ROMAN - and, ah, be introduced to each other. (crosstalk) 

00:17:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:30
DAISY ROMAN I guess that that is the main challenge where they have slowly walked. And, in, in that process,- (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:17:40
DAISY ROMAN - you know, to get there,- (crosstalk) 

00:17:40
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:17:40
DAISY ROMAN -still they have not met. 

00:17:40
JOHN LITTRELL  What else it needs to be done so that they can meet? What's the challenge? 

00:17:50
DAISY ROMAN  Well, perhaps, Daisy does not want to step forward anymore. 

00:18:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:18:00
DAISY ROMAN  And, Daisy still thinks that give up all away,- (crosstalk) 

00:18:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:18:10
DAISY ROMAN - even though she has learned to live with that. And, she does not wants it as part of, of her life forever. 

00:18:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:18:20
DAISY ROMAN And, ah. 

00:18:20
JOHN LITTRELL And so Daisy holds on to the hope that it will go away. 

00:18:25
DAISY ROMAN Yes, yes. We have learned, it's like a, a, a co-worker. We have learned to work together. We have done fun things together but I do not want when you're at home with me (laughing). I do not want to. 

00:18:40
JOHN LITTRELL Maybe the other co-worker will get a transfer. 

00:18:40
DAISY ROMAN (laughing) Exactly. (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:18:40
DAISY ROMAN Exactly. So, and ah. 

00:18:45
JOHN LITTRELL  And what happens, what is the meaning if you give up the hope that it goes away? 

00:19:00
[sil.] 

00:19:00
DAISY ROMAN  I guess that, uhm,- 

00:19:05
[sil.] 

00:19:05
DAISY ROMAN - I don't know. I think that Daisy has given to so many things and things that do feel good because she has learned to guide herself into a new world and healthy. (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:19:20
DAISY ROMAN But, perhaps, she is afraid of that how much more can fibromyalgia take and if she takes it, would that mean the strength will go with that? (crosstalk) 

00:19:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:19:35
DAISY ROMAN And, ah, perhaps, right now, we have to go balance and, thus, probably, probably have forever, a good balance. (crosstalk) 

00:19:40
JOHN LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:19:45
DAISY ROMAN And, meeting will be like letting fibromyalgia take, take over. 

00:19:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. It sounds like fibromyalgia is very demanding- (crosstalk) 

00:19:55
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:19:55
JOHN LITTRELL - more and more? 

00:19:55
DAISY ROMAN  And every day is like she can leave me alone for, it can leave me alone for two days and- (crosstalk) 

00:20:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:20:05
DAISY ROMAN - I'll be fine. And then, when I'm waking up with ah, you know, wanting to have the same energy, it has grabbed me and not letting me move and it's like, okay, we not speaking today. (crosstalk) 

00:20:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:20:15
DAISY ROMAN  And, ah, it's, it's just difficult. It's difficult. 

00:20:25
JOHN LITTRELL  So I sense that there's an uneasy truce. 

00:20:35
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:20:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uhm, it's not getting any worse right now but, on the other hand, uhm, it's not going away,- (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
DAISY ROMAN  Uh hmm. 

00:20:45
JOHN LITTRELL - and it also may in future, as I guess the confusion indicates, maybe, it'll start to be demanding again. 

00:20:50
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:20:55
Brief counseling does not dwell on problems. It searches for strengths and solutions. 

00:20:55
JOHN LITTRELL  And where will that strength? Will the strength continue to be there? 

00:21:05
DAISY ROMAN  And that is a big question and I guess that if here comes a lot from when I first, on, have fibromyalgia and it was very awful for me. I couldn't stand up from my bed. (crosstalk) 

00:21:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:21:25
DAISY ROMAN I was so fatigue. I was so much in pain. And, ah, I don't know if, if fibromyalgia is going to betray Daisy again, and,- (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
DAISY ROMAN - and, and take over just like that. (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:21:35
DAISY ROMAN  And, I feel. 

00:21:40
Reflecting of Feeling 

00:21:40
JOHN LITTRELL That the future looks can be very almost scary. 

00:21:45
DAISY ROMAN I think that, I think that, uhm, it could be a bright future if I let myself keep the balance. (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:21:55
DAISY ROMAN But meeting right in, in the middle will be, will be hard maybe eventually. I don't know. (crosstalk) 

00:22:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:22:10
DAISY ROMAN I don't know. 

00:22:10
Summary 

00:22:10
JOHN LITTRELL So as we rephrase this, maybe what we're talking about is, is that there is at this point, at least you, fibromyalgia and they don't need to meet in the middle,- (crosstalk) 

00:22:25
DAISY ROMAN Hmm. 

00:22:25
JOHN LITTRELL - but it's a least, can we have a balance? Can we have, can I continue in some ways to lead my life letting other people know,- (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:22:35
Paraphrasing Strengths 

00:22:35
JOHN LITTRELL - taking care of myself, listening to my own body. And is that going to be enough or sufficient,- (crosstalk) 

00:22:45
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:22:45
JOHN LITTRELL - ah, to kinda keep that in balance? 

00:22:45
DAISY ROMAN  Yes. I think it does. That's how, how I see it and that's how I perceive also the future- (crosstalk) 

00:22:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:22:55
DAISY ROMAN - having me, having my space, I guess, that this is- (crosstalk) 

00:23:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:23:00
DAISY ROMAN - giving each other space. And, ah, fibromyalgia could do and I could do. So,- (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:23:10
DAISY ROMAN - she gives me pain and I meditate. (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:23:15
DAISY ROMAN And, ah, I don't have energy so then I take care of myself. I take it- (crosstalk) 

00:23:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:23:20
DAISY ROMAN - slow today. And, ah, so, and when I do have. (crosstalk) 

00:23:25
JOHN LITTRELL So, a lot of learning to live with. 

00:23:25
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Yes, yes. (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:23:30
DAISY ROMAN And that, I could do for myself and I guess that the difficult part becomes when I have to present this to others. (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
DAISY ROMAN This is Daisy and fibromyalgia, fibromyalgia. 

00:23:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:23:45
Summary of Strengths 

00:23:45
JOHN LITTRELL And who have you already been that with? Who have you presented? (crosstalk) 

00:23:50
DAISY ROMAN Ah. 

00:23:50
JOHN LITTRELL Obviously, even right now, you're presenting to me but you're also because of the tapes being able to present that to other people? (crosstalk) 

00:23:55
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:23:55
JOHN LITTRELL And share, how someone can be strong and yet have something that in terms of the body,- (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
DAISY ROMAN Hmm. 

00:24:05
JOHN LITTRELL - makes them feel week- (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
DAISY ROMAN Hmm. 

00:24:05
JOHN LITTRELL - ah, and yet, the same time, what I'm hearing is a real sense that there's a strong soul too. (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
DAISY ROMAN  Yes. 

00:24:15
JOHN LITTRELL Even though the body may, sometimes, almost betray you. (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm, Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uhm, that there's a real from the early, that- 

00:24:20
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
JOHN LITTRELL - determination, the strengths- (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
DAISY ROMAN  Uh hmm. 

00:24:25
JOHN LITTRELL - that keeps going even as you're telling me now or you're telling other people? 

00:24:25
DAISY ROMAN  And, actually, and, it's been, ah, ah, very difficult on, at the beginning that even doctors, on were, on- (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:24:40
DAISY ROMAN - understanding of what- (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:24:40
DAISY ROMAN - fibromyalgia is- (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
JOHN LITTRELL Okay. 

00:24:40
DAISY ROMAN - in a patient and the pain or any of the, they do not want to accept that as something that can really an, unable a person to, to be. 

00:24:55
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. So there are people, even including doctors that may not understand? 

00:24:55
DAISY ROMAN Exactly. So, it was, it was, that was difficult. I guess that that was the most difficult- 

00:25:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:25:00
DAISY ROMAN - part of that, and. 

00:25:05
JOHN LITTRELL And what's it like right now as you try to help people? 

00:25:05
DAISY ROMAN  I guess that I choose who I going, who, whom- (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
JOHN LITTRELL Okay. 

00:25:10
DAISY ROMAN - I'm going to tell. (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
JOHN LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:25:15
DAISY ROMAN And, ah, and I have chosen just so few- (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
DAISY ROMAN - because not everyone understands- (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:25:20
DAISY ROMAN - fibromyalgia. (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:25:25
DAISY ROMAN I remember when I first started at the university I went to and we had a professor. And, ah, he was able to understand what I was going through because he also was going through. 

00:25:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. So there are people out there- (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
JOHN LITTRELL - that will have understanding, but I, I'm hearing almost what the risk is, is that I might, even though I have told a small number of people,- (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
JOHN LITTRELL - if I were begin to expand that, I'd be taking a larger risk in terms of maybe that there were gonna be people that aren't going to understand or might be judgmental. 

00:26:05
DAISY ROMAN And I believe that that is to me, the main reason,- (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:26:10
DAISY ROMAN - you know? They're not being able to understand makes them judgmental and then that is like a form of betraying, betrayal to me, and of, some of them commenting, "Oh that's only in her mind," you know? She can do better - (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:26:25
DAISY ROMAN - for herself. And because- (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:26:30
DAISY ROMAN - fibromyalgia, people saw it, you don't look like you have anything. (crosstalk) 

00:26:30
JOHN LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:26:35
DAISY ROMAN And, ah, that, that is painful to hear. (crosstalk) 

00:26:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:26:35
DAISY ROMAN It's painful to hear. 

00:26:35
JOHN LITTRELL  And so, I would say or I would suspect that, recently, you have told some people? 

00:26:45
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:26:45
JOHN LITTRELL And there may have been one or two or more that didn't understand? 

00:26:50
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:26:50
Strength Question 

00:26:50
JOHN LITTRELL How do you keep going on and face those that are not understanding? How do you do that? 

00:26:55
DAISY ROMAN I have learned to just, and, I, I believe that as human being, we cannot be experts in every area and we are ignorant in many areas. (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:05
DAISY ROMAN So I have had to accept the fact that they are ignorant and the, and the- (crosstalk) 

00:27:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:10
DAISY ROMAN - issues on, of fibromyalgia - (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:15
DAISY ROMAN - and, ah, that I need to just perhaps, ignores their comments or behavior- (crosstalk) 

00:27:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:20
DAISY ROMAN - towards, on fibromyalgia- (crosstalk) 

00:27:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:25
DAISY ROMAN - or, or comments towards myself. And, and just be, you know, just go for what I know and- (crosstalk) 

00:27:35
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:27:35
DAISY ROMAN - what is here for me- (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:27:40
DAISY ROMAN - and what I have to live through and go through. And, and I guess that at the same time thinking about everything that I've lived through- (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:45
DAISY ROMAN - with that,- (crosstalk) 

00:27:45
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:27:45
DAISY ROMAN - and that has made it solely on my life. 

00:27:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. So you, you can do that. 

00:27:50
DAISY ROMAN  Yes, yes. 

00:27:55
Reflection of Feeling, Positive Paraphrase 

00:27:55
JOHN LITTRELL It's a, it sounds like it's not a pleasant thing to do. 

00:28:00
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:28:00
JOHN LITTRELL But, ah, you do tell people. You've taken some risks. 

00:28:05
DAISY ROMAN Yes, but there is such a difference, when I first went. I walked in and, and spoke with my professor. 

00:28:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:28:10
DAISY ROMAN And he said, well, I, I understand- (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
JOHN LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:28:15
DAISY ROMAN - I have fibromyalgia, myself. 

00:28:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:28:15
DAISY ROMAN That the tears came to my eyes right away. 

00:28:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:28:20
DAISY ROMAN Because there was an understanding,- (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:28:20
DAISY ROMAN - there was that connection. 

00:28:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. So, it sound like there had been a range from very understanding, in this case with the professor to,- (crosstalk) 

00:28:25
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:28:25
JOHN LITTRELL - maybe the opposite end of the scale, some people very ignorant? 

00:28:35
DAISY ROMAN Yes. 

00:28:35
JOHN LITTRELL Not understanding? 

00:28:35
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm, Uh hmm. And,- (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
Strength Question 

00:28:40
JOHN LITTRELL So, how do you keep going with that? 

00:28:40
DAISY ROMAN - ah, I'd, I'd, I think that now that, that you say it and, and, and rephrase it for me. I think that looking at the, the lack of knowledge in this subject and me gaining the knowledge and the strength living through it and it, it, I have had so much to gain- (crosstalk) 

00:29:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
DAISY ROMAN - that perhaps they do not have today. 

00:29:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:29:10
DAISY ROMAN Not the knowledge nor fibromyalgia and not the spiritual life and the not the healthy,- (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
JOHN LITTRELL Hmm. 

00:29:15
DAISY ROMAN - and will be in, in directing themselves to meditation or yoga- (crosstalk) 

00:29:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:29:20
DAISY ROMAN - and so, it has, you know, fibromyalgia, like I said, I prefer to keep the balance because the good things it has brought to my life- (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:29:30
DAISY ROMAN - is, it feels so wonderful and so much (inaudible ). 

00:29:37
Confrontation, Strength Emphasis 

00:29:37
JOHN LITTRELL And how do you share of that? Just to, you know, even as I've been listening to you. 

00:29:40
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
JOHN LITTRELL Ah, it's very seldom that you get people who were sitting there going, you know, I've been able to find much more balance in my life. 

00:29:50
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:29:50
JOHN LITTRELL I listen to my body. I'm much more aware of issues in terms of kind of balance taking care of myself. Uhm, but it sounds like there's also a concern that, that can reach out and that, that may be an interesting message for other people about kind of how you go about doing that. 

00:30:10
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm, yes, I, I think that is a very interesting message and, but how, how to go about doing that,- (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
DAISY ROMAN - then, I, I have thought about meditation now. 

00:30:20
JOHN LITTRELL I, I am gonna have you go and how to go about doing that. Better than that. 

00:30:25
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm, okay, and (laughing). 

00:30:30
JOHN LITTRELL 'Coz, you already are, it sounds like- (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm, yes. 

00:30:30
JOHN LITTRELL - educating people. 

00:30:30
DAISY ROMAN  Yes, yes. 

00:30:35
[sil.] 

00:30:35
DAISY ROMAN  So, how do I go about on educating people about fibromyalgia or how- (crosstalk) 

00:30:45
JOHN LITTRELL Well, I guess I was hearing it in a larger context. 

00:30:50
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:30:50
JOHN LITTRELL Maybe, its, it's a, on the one the one hand there's fibromyalgia,- (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:30:55
JOHN LITTRELL - on the other hand there's also as you work with people. 

00:31:00
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

00:31:00
JOHN LITTRELL Uhm, I'm sure that you see many people who have ah, stress in their life, who have few resources for kinda how to go about dealing with that- (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:31:10
Strength Question 

00:31:10
JOHN LITTRELL - and, ah, I guess I was picking up maybe a larger message of you, almost as an educator, not just with fibromyalgia, but in a larger sense of how in the late 20th Century,- (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
JOHN LITTRELL - does a busy professional,- (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm.

00:31:25
DAISY ROMAN (Laughing) 

00:31:25
JOHN LITTRELL  How do you kinda keep all this in perspective and find the strength- (crosstalk) 

00:31:35
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:31:35
JOHN LITTRELL - and to deal with that? 

00:31:40
[sil.] 

00:31:40
DAISY ROMAN  Oh God, that is a very good question. I guess that, and it is, it, it is a challenge for, for anyone to, to, to face what I'm facing and how would I go about, and I have thought, I think that I've thought not only about how to go about educating people on, regarding fibromyalgia but then, every, so many other issues that comes today, my way, uhm, people with depression. 

00:32:20
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:32:20
DAISY ROMAN How do we go about? What kind of help is out there? 

00:32:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:32:25
DAISY ROMAN Who is out there advocating for this? 

00:32:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:32:25
DAISY ROMAN And ah, how do, how do we go ahead and do this? 

00:32:30
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:32:30
DAISY ROMAN And perhaps, that is the answer to, to the challenge that I brought here today. 

00:32:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:32:40
DAISY ROMAN And, perhaps, talking about and then presenting this to, to others and, ah, and, for example, where have I had most difficulty now is at university with my classmates- (crosstalk) 

00:32:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:32:55
DAISY ROMAN - and, and professors. And talking about it and presenting the issues rather than to just, just stay back and not to talk to them regarding because I will feel different- (crosstalk) 

00:33:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:33:10
DAISY ROMAN - and that getting them to gain the know, the knowledge- (crosstalk) 

00:33:15
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
DAISY ROMAN - through, through me will be a step to getting people educated and, ah. (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
JOHN LITTRELL Daisy, one of the things that I try to do when I work with people is that there's also maybe a little bit of selfishness in me on learning when I find people who have wisdom. 

00:33:35
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm, Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

00:33:35
JOHN LITTRELL And as I've been listening to you talk,- (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
Positive Feedback, Concrete 

00:33:40
JOHN LITTRELL - uhm, I almost had a senses that you framed it too small of kind of what your mission is. 

00:33:45
DAISY ROMAN  (Laughing) 

00:33:50
JOHN LITTRELL Ah, and part of that mission that you talked about was telling people in some ways about what fibromyalgia is. 

00:33:55
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:33:55
JOHN LITTRELL Ah, but I'm wondering also if you're not underselling yourself. 

00:34:00
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:34:00
JOHN LITTRELL In making that a too small the mission is, is that there's a larger mission here in terms of what people can do to learn how to be more in balance. And kind of, the example that you've been sharing with me has been a person who was in the last five years, much more in tune with emotions. 

00:34:20
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:34:20
JOHN LITTRELL Much more in tune with who she is and that that's a very powerful message that uhm, we don't see a lot of examples of. 

00:34:30
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:34:30
[sil.] 

00:34:30
DAISY ROMAN  This is, and it's, as, as I hear you on talking, I think about today, one of my thoughts was exactly that. How can, and, a person who struggles through so many negative things in his or her life could come about bringing so many positive things in, in their life. And, for those of us who have gone through the experience and struggles, how do we go about presenting this to others in order for them to, to know that there is hope and there is help and that, that they, if I have done it, they can also make it. 

00:35:30
JOHN LITTRELL  Uh hmm. 

00:35:35
DAISY ROMAN And ah, sharing the, the experience I'm talking about my experience- (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:35:40
DAISY ROMAN - on perhaps it is, it is the way to do it. I don't know,- (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:35:50
DAISY ROMAN - what you said, just brought that thought to my mind and I don't know, whether I'm answering or, or responding- (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:35:55
DAISY ROMAN - but I'm, you know it came, it came to mind.

Stage 3: Defining Goals Interview Summary Generalizing New Ideas To The Real Work John asks Daisy to summarize the session thus far. 

00:45:25
JOHN LITTRELL  Well I notice our time is kind of coming to a close here, I'm wondering, based on the things that we have been talking about so far,- (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
DAISY ROMAN  Uh hmm. 

00:45:45
JOHN LITTRELL - what the meeting is for you?

DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. 

00:45:45
JOHN LITTRELL What you've heard yourself saying? 

00:45:50
DAISY ROMAN Uh hmm. I think that, that it goes back again to where we started. 

00:45:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:45:55
DAISY ROMAN The strength and determination that I have carried through all my life. And still when I do not know the future on, I still, I'm strong today in, in facing tomorrow- (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:46:10
DAISY ROMAN - and determined to face the challenge that tomorrow would bring. And ah, I guess that when it comes to the first concern that I brought and challenge that I'm facing today, my concentration, lack of concentration in, in school, I have still the strength that I have provides for me to continue and work with fibromyalgia. 

00:46:35
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:46:35
DAISY ROMAN And, I have succeeded for a full year and with my practicum and ah, I have been a straight A student so, the lack of concentration that I have had has not affected me so far. So now that is there. I haven't seen any other paper, why should I put any more emphasis than I did before. 

00:46:55
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. 

00:46:55
DAISY ROMAN  So, the thing that, I've been here and answering questions and responding, all of those things comes to mind, the strength and, and determination that I carry. And perhaps, I just need to start taking steps and not hold myself into letting others know whether they'd understand or no, or not the, the fibromyalgia syndrome. 

00:47:25
JOHN LITTRELL Uh hmm. Well I have heard that you been doing a lot of listening and paying attention to your body.

00:47:40
DAISY ROMAN (Laughing) 

00:47:40
JOHN LITTRELL As your, as we end here, it might be that I would have you also listen, I use the word mission and I don't know if that's the word that fits for you, but listening to, I guess that larger mission for yourself, of not just the fibromyalgia, but also what's that larger mission that I have as far as letting other people know in some ways, in educating. 

00:48:05
DAISY ROMAN  Uh hmm. 

00:48:10
JOHN LITTRELL Ah, and then, maybe exploring that uhm, in some very tentative ways,- (crosstalk)
