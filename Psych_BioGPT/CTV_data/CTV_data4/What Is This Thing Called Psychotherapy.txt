JENNIFER ANDREWS My doctoral students the… the future. 

00:00:30
SHARON COTTOR Yes. 

00:00:30
JENNIFER ANDREWS Was just very, very taken with what you were talking about when you said, "What is this thing called psychotherapy?" And you also said that you and Sharon usually talked together about it, which made me feel like it'll be more complete if you were both here. Something that we struggle with also, what is this thing called psychotherapy. I think sometimes about Whittaker, was that if he wasn't changing, it wasn't good therapy. 

00:00:55
SHARON COTTOR Great. 

00:00:55
JENNIFER ANDREWS So… 

00:00:55
ROBERT COTTOR That is a piece of it. 

00:01:00
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:01:00
SHARON COTTOR That was also true for Milton Erikson… 

00:01:00
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:01:00
SHARON COTTOR …who was a magician… 

00:01:00
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yes. 

00:01:05
SHARON COTTOR …in terms of change. 

00:01:05
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah, yeah. 

00:01:05
ROBERT COTTOR And certainly could be seen as a social constructionist. 

00:01:10
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:01:10
DAVID CLARK Since social constructionist, in… in broader post-modern, people who identify with those kinds of ideas, find words as being so important. I'm wondering when we take… hear the word psychotherapy and its roots, there is a lot of people who prefer not to use that term at all as a matter of fact. They prefer to call themselves consultants or some other word. 

00:01:35
ROBERT COTTOR Okay. 

00:01:35
DAVID CLARK I'm wondering what are your thoughts about that? 

00:01:40
ROBERT COTTOR Well, we certainly have gone through that process of not knowing what to call ourselves and not knowing what to call what we do, work-wise. And, it was easy when we identified ourselves as family therapists, uh… 30 years ago, because it had a meaning in… in the professional community. But as we evolved with how we do therapy, we can't call ourselves just family therapists anymore. And this is why the theme of "What is this thing called psychotherapy" when Arlene and I were talking about that, was so intriguing because it's… it's a dialogue we've had a lot. And what we end up doing is describing a process and an experience rather than a thing. Because to us it's not a thing, it's a… it's a… a way of relating with the goal of helping people learn how to transform themselves and become who they would like to become, whether you call it coaching or consulting or psychotherapy. And we've had all three attached to the work that we do. 

00:03:00
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:03:00
SHARON COTTOR We are also willing to be labeled anything. What we think is more important is how do we think. And when you look at the definition from Webster's dictionary of psychotherapy, it's the medical model. 

00:03:15
JENNIFER ANDREWS That's right. 

00:03:15
SHARON COTTOR It's something defective, wrong. So, it's very difficult to think you're doing psychotherapy or therapy when you're wanting to be strength based, asset based… 

00:03:25
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:03:30
SHARON COTTOR …effective change, bring out the resources and strengths in people. 

00:03:30
ROBERT COTTOR Appreciative. 

00:03:35
SHARON COTTOR Appreciative. 

00:03:35
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:03:35
SHARON COTTOR Because that's not the way you're supposed to think if you have a patient in front of you and you're doing therapy. 

00:03:45
ROBERT COTTOR And we've… we've had to look at the… the whole tradition that we came from, professionally, and especially I came from as a child psychiatrist, in… in which you ask questions to make a diagnosis. You analyze the information you get, and with your diagnosis then you have some prescriptive treatment. And I always found… found that terribly constraining. 

00:04:20
JENNIFER ANDREWS Especially with a person who hasn't even been on the planet very long. 

00:04:25
ROBERT COTTOR That's right, that's right. 

00:04:25
SHARON COTTOR Yes. 

00:04:25
ROBERT COTTOR Or their family. 

00:04:30
SHARON COTTOR Right. 

00:04:30
ROBERT COTTOR And yet we only have diagnosis, really, for individuals. And we… we haven't worked individually at all, we work relationally. 

00:04:40
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:04:40
ROBERT COTTOR So, the nomenclature is just not useful. And… also, knowing where diagnoses have come from in that there our social constructions that are part of a socio-political or medical socio-political business. And we're designed to inform researchers rather than to be something that can be helpful to practitioners has made it easy for us to move away from that. 

00:05:10
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:05:15
ROBERT COTTOR But we haven't been able to replace it with a similar system. And so what we talk about is what… what we do with people and… and what we emphasize is the… the critical nature of the relationship that you establish with the people with whom you're working with. You call them patients or clients or customers. And that's true for us whether we are doing what is called therapy or what is called coaching or what is called consulting. All of which we have done as they are… as they are identified in our professional communities. 

00:05:55
DAVID CLARK So it sounds like if there was going to be an assessment in your work, the assessment would be about what was that individual or that family's assets and resources and strengths currently and in the past. Maybe you will use what a… assessment, you might be assessing your relationship with the… your ongoing relationship with the client? 

00:06:20
SHARON COTTOR And also, thinking about words are just metaphors. And so if somebody comes to us and says they are depressed, we don't necessarily know what that means. And so, we will ask them what that means and we will ask them when are the times that they are not depressed and what are the things they'd have to do to become more depressed, because that indirectly tells them what they may need to do to become less depressed. And people even when they are severely depressed, are not depressed all the time. What's that five minutes of the day that they were smiling or they felt good, and what were they doing at that time. And to expand more on their health and what's working rather than what's not working. Umm… So, we don't tend to think in the pathological terms, but we try to reshape those quickly. Like for us, even memories to us are always constructions, and rather than accurate uh… accurate information from the past… people know me well know that I'll say we're never too old for a happy childhood and we are never too young for a positive ageing. And how do we want the story ourselves? So, even if I have been a real victim in something or there has been a huge tragedy, do I want to live that story or do I want to be a hero or heroine, and having survived and now living life. Because we would believe that we are hard wired for pain and fear, but we create our own suffering and we suffer through would have, should have, could have, if only. And if we deal with what is, then it may not be what we chose, but to counter fear, we believe is love, appreciation, courage, admiration and you can't be courageous or admired if you have an easy path to walk. It's how well you walk the path if it's difficult. 

00:08:30
JENNIFER ANDREWS That's beautiful. That's poetic. Yeah. 

00:08:35
ROBERT COTTOR And that's what therapy… what we call therapy… 

00:08:35
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:08:40
ROBERT COTTOR …this …this process of transformation, because we tend to use the word transformation rather than even change because change… the word change has become so common and (inaudible ) at this point. Transformation seems to still have a special meaning to it. And I think this is a transformative process. 

00:09:00
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:09:00
ROBERT COTTOR And what we attempt to do is to invite those others with whom we will be working into a relationship with us, and a relationship in which they can experience us all working together. And this is where collaboration is the essence of what we are doing. We… We… We don't approach them hierarchally. We do not approach them with our knowledge about families or people or child development, or whatever it might be. We may use those knowledges, but that is not what we are presenting. What we're offering them is an opportunity to have a very special kind of dialogue in which they can learn more about what they don't know they know and about the possibilities of knowing something other, and ways of being able to propel themselves into the future to have the lives and the ways of being and the ways of relating that they desire. 

00:10:05
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:10:05
SHARON COTTOR So, we like to not spend a lot of time on the story that they know, but what's the story they know, but they don't know they know it. Like someone in our workshop, this afternoon, was saying that it was going to be very stressful for her to go back and take care of her ageing father for three months. And I said, "What would it take for you to believe that it would be less stressful this time 'cause you had experienced it three months before?" And she said, "I never thought about that before." And for us, wonderful moments for ourselves as well as for the people we collaborate with is when they say, "I never thought of that before." And we love those moments for ourselves too when, "I never thought about that before." 

00:10:55
JENNIFER ANDREWS I had… Thoughts are just pouring in. I had three thoughts. At the moment, I can only remember two of them. But one is, we just did a session with a narrative therapist with a family that actually… these students brought the family they have been working with who have chronic illness and, you know, just over your head in pain and trouble. And the therapist said, I mean, they were depressed, and she said, "Have you ever had a time in your life when you lost your optimism before?" And everything shifted. It was… It was just beautiful. The second thought I had was… now I remember the third thought also. The second thought I had was when people come to you, do you find… I find it… I don't know if you find it, that they don't often know what they want? They come because they are in trouble, but they… they don't have a path carved out. 

00:11:45
SHARON COTTOR Also, we would find that the people who are suffering are focused on the would have, should have, could have for fulfillment, and when they deal with it, the focus is how to get them to deal with whatever it is they have to deal with. And when we think about our lives, there are things that we prepared for, auditioned for, we get the part, but then there are other times in our lives we never rehearsed for it, we never would have auditioned for it, but we have to deal with it. And the sooner we deal with it and feel proud and good about whatever we have to deal with… 

00:12:20
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:12:25
SHARON COTTOR Umm… And we have to live that too. Like our youngest daughter was faced with the possibility of ovarian cancer, and I was talking to her grandmother that day the night before her surgery, and she said, "Who are you talking to?" And I said, "Your grandmother." My mother had her dead and buried. And Elizabeth answered the phone and said, "Grandma, I'm going to be okay. And even if I'm not okay, I'll be okay." And we were so proud that she knew how to deal with it. We also have a son who has a grand… son with a very, very bad umm… neurological, genetic disease called spinal muscular atrophy and it's similar to the Lou Gehrig's disease. And he is very bright… 

00:13:05
ROBERT COTTOR Only a student… 

00:13:10
SHARON COTTOR Good natured, but he can't move his arms and legs and hold his head up. And we were very fortunate to live… this family lived in London when they got the diagnosis. And Bob was with our son and his wife and their little eight-month-old boy, seeing the pediatric neurologist while I was babysitting the three and a half-year-old. And when we came home, we heard this label we'd never heard before. SMA, what is that? Bob's older sister was a pediatrician. She had never heard of it before. But she had heard of floppy babies before, and these are floppy babies. But that evening, we went out to dinner with them and we were so proud, 'cause our son was saying, "I need to get off the fast track," because he was during… during… doing European marketing for Pillsbury. And then, uh… 

00:13:55
ROBERT COTTOR General Mills. 

00:13:55
SHARON COTTOR General Mills when they purchased them. He said, "We have to get home so we can have family support. And we don't have to be yuppies, we need a van, 'cause we're going to need to have a lift. We need a one storey house, not a two storey house." And now and then, they got off track. But we were so proud of how quickly they were able to deal with it rather than "why us" or "it shouldn't be" or what… take the energy to deal with whatever it is you have to deal with. And I think that's very difficult for the people that come to us as they are fighting. What is it they are having to deal with that they don't want to deal with and how can they do it in an empowering way rather than disempower themselves by trying to say, "It shouldn't have happened." 

00:14:40
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:14:40
ROBERT COTTOR But you're going to be the story you feed. And so what we try to do to get people into a story that can create hope and courage and a vision of the future that for them means something important has changed, has been transformed, and it's a more desirable future. And this shifts our thinking. We can't talk to them about being social constructionists, but what we can do is talk in ways that they can become social constructionists without knowing and construct the futures that they are looking for. And what we have also found is this is not a matter of learning techniques or the right questions to ask. It's a way of perceiving, it's a way of thinking and it's a way of being. So, to be… from my point of view, to be effective in this kind of work, you really have to be what you are hoping that those with… with whom you are working can become, and that they can experience that in action with you and can appreciate the power of relationships in generating the energy in the… that's necessary to create these kinds of transformative changes, no matter what the story is that they started off with, no matter how awful or scary it might be. 

00:16:05
JENNIFER ANDREWS So you have to walk the walk and talk the talk. 

00:16:10
SHARON COTTOR Absolutely, it tells 24/7. 

00:16:10
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:16:10
SHARON COTTOR Where is love? 

00:16:10
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:16:10
SHARON COTTOR Where is appreciation? Where is courage? Where is admiration? And whenever I find myself suffering, I think, "What is the should have, would have, could have, if only?" Let go of it and deal with whatever is. 

00:16:25
JENNIFER ANDREWS Seven years ago, the California state changed the number of hours people had to have to graduate. So, they changed the law that we needed 50 hours to graduate, now they wanted 200… 200 hours. And I developed something called "The Elder Project" where my students went out and talked to elders, and I got challenged. I was asked how I was calling this therapy. We weren't invited to help anybody, nobody wanted it. And I said well, we'll do a little qualitative research. And I assigned a test to all of my students to ask the clients, "clients", to ask the people if they were getting anything out of this, if it was good for them, how they felt and did they want us to continue. And so the… I mean, you can imagine. They said, "Oh, yes. It would be terrible if you didn't come back." "Yes, we get a lot out of it." So, I decided I was calling it therapy. 

00:17:20
SHARON COTTOR Yes. 

00:17:20
JENNIFER ANDREWS And that they would have to come down at me legally to make me stop. 

00:17:25
SHARON COTTOR Uh-huh. 

00:17:25
ROBERT COTTOR And that really is a part of the dilemma that we ask, practitioners get in to today. Because with at least in Arizona, how we experience those regulations, those definitions of who we can be and what we can do, they really are obstructions to creating the relationships we need. I mean, you are supposed to be neutral with people, although there is no such thing as neutrality. When you are really creative with people, you are enjoying, it's… it's a lovely relationship, it's a magical relationship. But you might even touch, you might even hug. And you have to be natural for the people you are working with. Well, no, it's unnatural, and then they are not going to go in that direction. 

00:18:15
SHARON COTTOR And Bob has the advantage of having the medical, uh… requirements rather than mine. And I was required recently to go to an ethics and legal course as part of our licensing. And at the end, on the evaluation they asked me what did I learn? And I said what I learned is that my profession has lost its heart. 

00:18:40
JENNIFER ANDREWS Oh! 

00:18:40
SHARON COTTOR Because if you're not supposed to go to a funeral, or you're not supposed to accept a gift or you're not supposed to… And we had one old-time social worker at the conference and she kept saying, "But I work with elderly people and they like to give me something they've crocheted." And the person presenting said, "Well, don't tell anybody here." And we have lost the art. 

00:19:00
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:19:00
SHARON COTTOR The art of living. 

00:19:05
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:19:05
SHARON COTTOR The art of sharing, the art of collaborating, and no matter what we want to call it, that's the part we want to preserve. 

00:19:15
ROBERT COTTOR And it's not a science what we… They've try to make this thing we call therapy a science. And they… they have now the best practices and empirically designed procedures and techniques, and maybe that works for surgery. But it doesn't work for people being able to create new futures. And so if we are going to be able to be as powerful collaborators with them as we can be, we have to be willing to go beyond those boundaries. Because it has to… it has to be an art, and it's different with every situation and with every group if… or individual that you're working with. And to have that freedom for that creativity with it and whatever it takes to… to create that loving, respectful, honest relationship that brings out the most of everybody including yourself… 

00:20:20
SHARON COTTOR Encourage hope. 

00:20:20
ROBERT COTTOR …and you have to be willing to change. 

00:20:20
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. David works for an HMO, he works with Chrysler(ph) and he has some elderly people who come in and they bring him… this happened Wednesday evening just before we got ready to come here… eggs, they bring him a dozen of brown eggs and some of them are double-yolked… 

00:20:35
SHARON COTTOR Oh, wonderful. 

00:20:35
JENNIFER ANDREWS …because they have chickens, and they are happy to bring it to him. I'm saying, "Are you sure you accept this gift?" 

00:20:45
SHARON COTTOR And yet, we are supposed to not do harm. And what kind of harm would you do if you refused their offer? 

00:20:50
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:20:50
DAVID CLARK And I think, also, one of the things I've been thinking about at this conference, since we are also working with a lot of people who do organizational work and how you do too, especially family, own businesses… And one of the things I think is important to pay attention to, how do we create space for… to open up possibilities? Whether we are working in a particular community, such as a community which you have worked in, or whether you're working in a psychiatric hospital or HMO, or wherever you are working, can I, with some you know collaborators, somehow, be able to create that kind of space? 

00:21:25
SHARON COTTOR When we are working with high conflict, let's say there is a couple that is getting a divorce or a couple that's thinking about whether they want a divorce or not, or whether, umm… trying to think of other times… uh… but quickly, like, if I have a couple that they have a big issue about… she knows how he should change or she doesn't have to, and he knows how she should change so the other one doesn't have to. I will ask at the end of the first interview, "Will you please be willing to do one thing when before you come back, and will you promise that you will decide that there are four things you will do that you know your partner would appreciate. And will you please promise to do four things that you know your partner will appreciate. But I don't want you to tell them what it is. And there isn't any magic to this. I'm just trying to change your lens, so that when you come back for the next appointment, I'm going to count on the fact that you don't want to look stupid, because I'm going to ask you what do you think those four things are that your partner did, and what do you think those four things are that your partner did?" And I have visual uh… just… visceral responses, different, when that couple walks in the second time versus the first, because they have changed the lens. 

00:22:55
DAVID CLARK When I… When I suggest something similar to that, I'd often have a couple coming back saying they failed because they did talk about it. 

00:23:05
SHARON COTTOR Really? 

00:23:05
DAVID CLARK We talk about what a good failure that is. 

00:23:10
SHARON COTTOR And… And Bob tends to do very high conflict divorce and family assessments, and I collaborate with him at the times on them. And we tend to see the, umm… two divorcing people for the first session together. And we start out with, "What do you appreciate about the other person as a parent?" "And what do you appreciate about the other person as a parent?" The last thing they want to do is tell us that because they want their side to win. And then I'll often be shocked and say, you know, if they say, "There isn't anything I appreciate. That's why I think I should have the child." And I'll say, "But what happens if this afternoon you're killed in a car accident and there is no question where those children will go? And they are only four or six. And five years from now, they are going to say, Mom or Dad, I don't remember you. How do you want that partner to be describing you, the other parent?" And sometimes they'll even cry, and then I'll kill off the other one and ask, "What would you do?" Uh… "Or after this is all over and you're looking from Ms. Right or Mr. Right, how do you hope your ex-partner will be describing you? And is that the way you want to be playing your part?" Because again we feel, in court, especially domestic relations, you can find the nicest people acting their worst. 

00:24:35
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:24:35
SHARON COTTOR And in criminal court, you find the worst people acting their best. 

00:24:40
ROBERT COTTOR But what we are trying to do is really to perturb their thinking in a way they haven't experienced and trying to get them to point, even when they come in with a high conflict divorce, to get them thinking differently. Because they are never going to be divorced, they're always going to have a relationship. They're gonna have a relationship through their children as long as they live. They don't realize that. They don't recognize it in the heat of the battle. And we attempt, at that early point, to get them to start recognizing that so they can act in ways that can work best for that whole system, that whole network of relationship. 

00:25:15
JENNIFER ANDREWS The questions that you ask and things you point out change their direction, because if you didn't ask those things, they would just keep going. 

00:25:25
SHARON COTTOR It creates new meaning for them… new meaning and new directions for them. 

00:25:30
ROBERT COTTOR And even if we can confuse them with those questions. We know… knew Milton Erickson well enough to know how creative that confusion can become. So that's part of that. 

00:25:40
SHARON COTTOR I never thought about that before. Magical moments. 

00:25:45
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:25:45
DAVID CLARK I was thinking that… since the dominant culture would have very… has very different ideas about "What is this thing called psychotherapy?", they were also aware of… in regards to your work, is that you have doctorate students or other researchers who are doing research on people you work with? 

00:26:05
ROBERT COTTOR We never have. 

00:26:05
DAVID CLARK Never have. 

00:26:10
ROBERT COTTOR We've never had an academic affiliation… 

00:26:10
SHARON COTTOR How… 

00:26:15
ROBERT COTTOR …and in terms of my discipline, I've acted outside of my discipline for years. You mentioned psychiatric hospital earlier. The last time I worked in a psychiatric hospital was on the Peninsula, San Francisco Peninsula in 1970 when I put together a program for adolescents driven by the… 

00:26:35
SHARON COTTOR Drug abuse. 

00:26:35
ROBERT COTTOR …the drug abuse in San Francisco and suburbs area and… I didn't know what I was doing at that point. But what I found myself doing was they gave me a empty wing of the county hospital. And I made the entrance to the hospital the fire escape so that the kids and/or their parents wouldn't have to go through the lobby, the emergency room or whatever… 

00:27:00
JENNIFER ANDREWS Climb the ladder… 

00:27:00
ROBERT COTTOR they could come right up to where we were up there. And I even got the hospital… it was… it was a comment on the era, to accept these kids going through the hospital, and bare feet, because I found some research that demonstrated that bare feet carry fewer germs than shoes. 

00:27:20
SHARON COTTOR And children's shoes specially, and… 

00:27:25
ROBERT COTTOR And we had a… we had a really wonderful program that unfortunately was ended when they basically ended community mental health in California… 

00:27:35
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:27:35
SHARON COTTOR Right. 

00:27:35
ROBERT COTTOR …in 1971. 

00:27:35
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:27:40
SHARON COTTOR And yet, we have a different kind of research. And the research we have in terms of experiences is we have only people who come to us because of other people we've worked with who have referred. We also have the research in our lived experience where with couples or people who have dealt with us and then they'll come back later because of some transformation or a new life experience that they are dealing with. Or they will send their children or they will send their friends or they will send their neighbors. And as Bob was talking about the… the drug abuse training center, we had an interesting experience about 10 years ago when we were speaking to a regional conference. And while we were presenting, I kept seeing this face that looks so familiar to me, but I couldn't identify it. And when it was over with, this woman came up to Bob and she said, "I wasn't interested in this program but when I saw your name, I wanted to come to see you because I wanted to thank you with what you said to me back at this time." And we had this conversation, and then we went to lunch, I said, "Well, Bob, what did you say?" He said, "I don't know, I forgot to tell her." 

00:29:00
ROBERT COTTOR I haven't seen her. 

00:29:00
SHARON COTTOR So that's the kind of research that we have. 

00:29:00
JENNIFER ANDREWS Yeah. 

00:29:05
DAVID CLARK The reason I asked that question was I think it's also important for us to have some influence in bigger picture and somehow our… kind of work that you're doing needs to be…

ROBERT COTTOR We would love to have been able to have that, to be able to have it… or for with the people we have trained who continue in our Phoenix area to practice in these kinds of ways.

SHARON COTTOR We also feel good when we hear people say, you know "You've taught us how to think in a different way, and I'm doing at work too. Would you mind working with our management group?" Or, "Would you mind… Could I bring a colleague in and deal with it because they are learning a way to think?" And when I coach people in terms of business, maybe they have got a boss that's very difficult to deal with. And I will, within that first conversation ask them what they would like that boss to appreciate about them. And often they will say, "I never thought about that." "And are you playing your part in that way? And what do you think your boss would like you to appreciate about… about him?"
