Step One Identifying Stresses 

00:00:00
LISA Hello Darrylin. 

00:00:25
DARRYLIN Hi. 

00:00:25
LISA My name is Lisa. 

00:00:25
DARRYLIN Hi, Lisa. 

00:00:25
LISA I'm one of the counselors here. 

00:00:30
DARRYLIN Okay. 

00:00:30
LISA Welcome. 

00:00:30
DARRYLIN Thank you. 

00:00:30
LISA Can you tell me what's brought you here today? 

00:00:30
Explore Concerns 

00:00:30
DARRYLIN It's really my son. I'm um. He's actually taking drugs and I'm really worried about him. It's terrible and I'm feeling very bad. 

00:00:40
LISA What's your son's name. 

00:00:40
DARRYLIN Ah, he's name's Slade. Yeah. 

00:00:45
LISA Okay, and how old is he? 

00:00:45
DARRYLIN He's 25. 

00:00:45
LISA Right, okay. I'm just going to take notes. 

00:00:50
DARRYLIN Okay. 

00:00:50
LISA Can you tell me, can you describe to me what's happened? 

00:00:50
DARRYLIN Well, he's using speed. And it makes him really angry. So it changes his personality, and uh, he's very abusive. He argues with everyone. He's making it very difficult at home. My family's really very upset. I'm upset. It's just terrible. 

00:01:15
LISA Darrylin, I'm really sorry to here that. What's this been like for you? 

00:01:15
DARRYLIN Oh, shocking. Um, I'm so worried. I have some days where I just have a feeling that something terrible is going to happen to him. So, I feel really depressed about everything. I'm finding it really hard to cope. 

00:01:30
Deal with Emotions 

00:01:30
LISA Mm-hmm. The sense of dread that I seem to pick up from you then. You notice that being happening for a long time for you. 

00:01:40
DARRYLIN Yes it has. He started uh, taking drugs when he was about 15. So it's been quite a long time. And I'm just really tired of everything. It's just too difficult. 

00:01:50
LISA Yes, yes. So you've been living with this amount of stress for a long, long time. 

00:01:55
DARRYLIN Mmm. 

00:01:55
LISA Yes. 

00:01:55
DARRYLIN Well, he started taking cannabis, in the beginning. 

00:02:00
LISA Okay. 

00:02:00
DARRYLIN And uh, he's personality has just changed. He's not the same person that I knew. He's not my son. So it's really difficult. 

00:02:10
LISA What's it like for the rest of your family. 

00:02:15
DARRYLIN They're, they're very angry because I think I spend a lot of time trying to make things okay. And uh, especially with him. And so, I think they get upset because I probably don't take enough notice of them. And they feel I should be harder on him but I'm too scared to do that because I just think something terrible is going to happen, so. 

00:02:35
Empathizing and Active Listening 

00:02:40
LISA So it sounds like you get caught between, you know, protecting I guess your son. Or perhaps trying to be the peace maker in the family perhaps. 

00:02:45
DARRYLIN Yes. 

00:02:50
LISA And the rest of your, your family being anger at you, so. 

00:02:50
DARRYLIN Yeah, yeah. 

00:02:50
LISA So, it's a hard position to be in, and it's a real common position to be in. 

00:02:55
DARRYLIN Yeah. 

00:02:55
LISA It really is. And I'm picking up that this has been a struggle for you for a long, long time. 

00:03:00
DARRYLIN Oh it has, yes. I really feel like I'm at the end of my tether at the moment. I just don't know what to do. 

00:03:10
LISA Yeah. And of course feeling like you're at the end of your tether is a very normal reaction. You've been under a tremendous amount of stress, almost trauma. Probably for a long period of time. 

00:03:15
DARRYLIN Yes. 

00:03:15
LISA So, you're reactions or what you're feeling at the moment is very, very normal. How is you general health and well being? 

00:03:25
DARRYLIN Um, I don't sleep very well. I'm always listening for him to come home because he does stay out very late. And that worries me, I'm scared of what might be happen to him. So, I stay awake or if I do sleep it's just for a very short time. And then I find that I'm awake, I'm startled by any noise. 

00:03:50
LISA Darrylin, and what you've described to me sounds very stressful. And what you've described is that you're having trouble sleeping and you're in constant tension. You're worried about when he comes home or if he's going to come hone and then what's going to happen. And it sounds like it's been absolutely dreadful for you. What other ways is it affecting you? 

00:04:05
Explore Impact on Family 

00:04:10
DARRYLIN Well, it really affects my family. There's lot of arguments at home now. My daughter is very angry. She really thinks I should be a lot harder on Slade. And the two of them don't speak at all. She's very upset. I think the way that she covers up her being upset, is getting very, very angry and really angry with me. 

00:04:35
LISA There's a lot of conflict and turmoil it sounds like. 

00:04:40
DARRYLIN Yes, yes. My younger son's just very quiet. I'm just afraid that he's depressed as well. It's very, very traumatic at home. 

00:04:55
LISA Absolutely. Just to help me I just need to get an idea of whose in your family. 

00:05:00
DARRYLIN Okay. 

00:05:00
LISA Because you talked a little bit about the impact on them and I"m curious as to find out a little bit more about that. 

00:05:05
DARRYLIN Right. 

00:05:05
LISA Just help me, Darrylin. There's yourself, and Slade. 

00:05:05
DARRYLIN Yes. 

00:05:10
LISA He's living at home is he? 

00:05:10
DARRYLIN Yes, he is. Yes. And uh, then there's my daughter, she's the oldest. 

00:05:15
LISA How old is she? 

00:05:15
DARRYLIN Um, she's 26. 

00:05:20
LISA And how, what's her name. 

00:05:20
DARRYLIN Lowanna. 

00:05:20
LISA Okay. And then there's Slade. 

00:05:25
DARRYLIN And then there's my younger son, Simon. He's 15. 

00:05:30
LISA Okay, so you've got two older ones then a 15. 

00:05:30
DARRYLIN Yes, yes. 

00:05:30
LISA Okay. Anybody else, Darrylin, in your family? 

00:05:35
DARRYLIN No, no. I'm on my own. 

00:05:40
LISA Okay. So, you were saying Lowanna um, fights quite a bit with Sledge. 

00:05:45
DARRYLIN Oh, yes, oh, yes. They used to be really great pals but once he started taking drugs, she's very against that. And any way, he's changed so much. She has no time for him and she's very angry with me. She thinks that I should ask him to leave, that he's causing us so much problem, you know, that he should go find somewhere else to live. But I'm too scared to do that. I, I feel something terrible is going to happen to him and so I want to keep him at home. So, that I can, at least make sure he's okay, do you know. 

00:06:15
LISA Yes, absolutely. Darrylin, I'm picking up about your fear about what might happen with Slade. Can you, can you perhaps tell me what you're really frightened of. 

00:06:25
DARRYLIN Um, it's really hard to say, but it's just like a premonition I have. I think I'm scared that he's perhaps either going to be using so many drugs that he will have a car accident because he's out so late. Or that something maybe happen to him. Um, perhaps, I'm scared he's going to use heroin or something and overdose really because he's sort of taken different drugs over the time. And even though now, he's using speed. I'm scared he will use other drugs. 

00:07:05
LISA So there's two things there that you've told me. What I'm hearing you say, you're scared he's going to go on and use a different type of drug. 

00:07:05
DARRYLIN Yes. 

00:07:10
LISA Namely heroin. And the other thing is that you mentioned, is that something might happen to him. 

00:07:15
DARRYLIN Yes. 

00:07:15
LISA Perhaps you're frightened of him being hurt or of him dying as a result of his, his drug use. 

00:07:20
DARRYLIN Yes, yes. That I am. 

00:07:20
LISA That's, that's an awful burden to bare isn't. All the time. 

00:07:25
DARRYLIN It's terrible. And I think he's dealing. So, I don't know who he's mixing with. And because he's out all night, I'm afraid what could be happening out there too, and who he's with. 

00:07:40
LISA What I'm sensing from you there's a sense, there's a feeling that you're out of control as a parent. 

00:07:45
DARRYLIN Yes. I'm very, I'm very worried about him. I don't know what to do. 

00:07:55
[music] 

00:07:55
Step Two Providing Information: Exploring Goals 

00:07:55
LISA Darrylin, can you tell me what you would like to get out coming to see me today? 

00:08:10
DARRYLIN Well, I'm really very worried so I would like to actually feel a bit better about myself and what's going on. And I think I would like to be a better mum. I feel like at the moment I'm neglecting my other children. And I feel so depressed and unable to cope. I'd like to feel better. I'm also really worried about Slade and his drug taking. And I feel like I don't have enough information. I, I don't know what, I mean I see the change, the change in his personality but I don't really know what actually is happening to him with speed. And I'm scared there's going to be some major effect on him. So, I guess I'd like a little bit more information on what, you know. 

00:09:00
LISA Absolutely. Certainly, I'd be happy to spend as much time as you need on the information. In fact, that's really important. 

00:09:10
DARRYLIN Yeah. 

00:09:10
LISA Just picking up on what you said, earlier. What you'd like to get out of coming here. You know, you said, you'd like to feel normal. You would like to um, probably be a better mother. I heard that. Or a better parent. 

00:09:20
DARRYLIN Yes. 

00:09:20
Normalise Reaction to Stress 

00:09:20
LISA It's actually a real common reaction to feel like this. To feel that you're, you're not functioning the best that you can. 

00:09:25
DARRYLIN No, I'm not functioning well. 

00:09:25
Identifying Commonalities with Other Trauma 

00:09:30
LISA It's, it's a very normal function to what you've been going through. Did you know that there's enough, there's enough evidence to suggest that families impacted by drug use, you know, uh, experiencing the same amount of trauma as, as other families who might have someone with a terminal illness. The level of stress that you're experiencing. 

00:09:50
DARRYLIN Yes. I feel like we can't talk anymore. There's always this cloud hanging over us. And it somehow the conversation always gets back to Slade. And what he's doing. 

00:10:00
LISA Okay. It sounds like it's always focused on Slade. 

00:10:05
DARRYLIN I don't know if he's using other drugs. I'm worried about what effect they're going to have on him. 

00:10:10
LISA Okay. Let's, how much do you know about amphetamines? 

00:10:10
DARRYLIN I don't really know very much at all, actually. 

00:10:15
Providing Information About Drug Effects 

00:10:15
LISA Okay, you're aware of what effect amphetamines has on the body? 

00:10:20
DARRYLIN No, not really. I mean I only see what he does, but. 

00:10:20
LISA Okay. 

00:10:25
DARRYLIN I don't really know. 

00:10:25
LISA You know how said that Slade becomes quite aggressive and sometimes moody. That's so often uh, what happens when people actually use amphetamines. Amphetamines are a stimulant. 

00:10:35
DARRYLIN Oh. 

00:10:35
LISA So that means that goes into the body it goes straight into to the nervous system. It speeds everything up. It makes people feel really super confident. And sometimes people come across as a bit arrogant and quite cocky, I guess at times. 

00:10:50
DARRYLIN Yes. Well that's what he's like. 

00:10:55
LISA Yeah, and aggression and sometimes violence. And sometimes people feel quite unsafe around people who have been using speed. 

00:11:05
DARRYLIN Yes, yes. Yeah, he's really strange. And he sleeps a lot during the day and he wakes up in the afternoon and then go out. But he sleeps most of the day. So it's really, he's very strange on. 

00:11:20
LISA Yeah, so what happens with people when they do actually use amphetamines, and I'm interesting to know how long he's been using for. It's the sleep patterns all go out. 

00:11:30
DARRYLIN Yes. 

00:11:30
LISA They often use for two or three days and then they crash for a few days afterwards. Often they, they lose their appetite, they lose weight. 

00:11:35
DARRYLIN Mmm, oh. 

00:11:35
LISA Their skin goes bad. 

00:11:35
DARRYLIN Mmm, oh. 

00:11:40
LISA Have you noticed that with Slade? 

00:11:40
DARRYLIN He is so thin. He looks really terrible. 

00:11:45
LISA And that can be traumatic anyway, looking at your son or your daughter like that. 

00:11:45
DARRYLIN Yeah. He's so changed it's unbelievable. 

00:11:50
Assessment of Speed Use 

00:11:50
LISA How long has he been using speed for? 

00:11:55
DARRYLIN I don't really know because he won't talk to me about it. He started using when he was 15. And I certainly knew he was using cannabis. And I tend to think he started to get really aggressive about 12 months ago. So, I, I think it was probably around that time. Um, really I don't know because you know, you can't talk to him. He's just angry all the time. 

00:12:25
LISA And it all, it all depends doesn't it on, on who the child is and their age, and how long they've been using and things like that. 

00:12:35
DARRYLIN Yes, yes. 

00:12:35
LISA Uh, what, what other parents are actually saying is that amphetamines is probably the worst drug they've encountered, um, in the family. 

00:12:40
DARRYLIN Mmm. 

00:12:40
LISA And, and many can get addicted to amphetamines. 

00:12:45
DARRYLIN Yes. 

00:12:45
LISA Do you know much about dependency at all? 

00:12:45
Exploring Dependence 

00:12:50
DARRYLIN Well, I'm sure, I guess I feel he is dependent on it. No I don't know a lot about it. But I do think he is because he's using I'm sure everyday because he goes out every night. And I'm really worried that he's dealing as well. Because even though I do give him money, I don't know how he's coping really because he lost his job and you know, so. I know he must be getting money selling to his friends or something as well. 

00:13:25
LISA What I'm picking up from you is a sense of, of Slade going into dangerous territory. 

00:13:30
DARRYLIN Oh. 

00:13:35
LISA And living a life of you know, dealing and drug using. 

00:13:40
DARRYLIN And I'm very afraid of what he's actually doing. You know. 

00:13:40
LISA Of course. 

00:13:45
DARRYLIN He comes home with video players and I don't know where he's getting this stuff from. And I'm scared he's actually doing crime or something like that. It's just terrible. And I didn't bring him up like that. 

00:14:00
LISA No. 

00:14:00
DARRYLIN So, it's just having such an effect on us all. 

00:14:05
Exploring Motivation for Change 

00:14:05
LISA Has he ever given any indication to you that he might like to change what he's doing or perhaps seek some help. 

00:14:15
DARRYLIN Not really. He um, I talk to him, I try to talk to him about his drug taking but he doesn't, he just says I'm being stupid and he's okay. And not to worry about him. And um, uh, no. He doesn't give me any indication that he wants to change. He tells me he's okay. 

00:14:40
LISA So, um, it sounds like he's quite happy doing what he's doing, you know, in terms of using his drugs. He's got no intention of changing at this particular point in time. 

00:14:50
DARRYLIN I don't think so, I don't think so. 

00:14:50
LISA That can be very difficult as a parent. 

00:14:50
DARRYLIN It is it's terrible, and it's very hard to talk to him about it because he gets really angry and brushes me off, or screams and yells. So, I just have to stop talking to him about it. Because otherwise, you know, the whole house gets in an absolute uproar. My daughter starts yelling at him for upsetting me. Because often when these things happen, you know, I'll start crying and my daughter gets really upset then. So, I try to not have these conversations with him anymore. 

00:15:30
[music] 

00:15:30
Step Three Counsel About Coping 

00:15:30
LISA Darrylin you mentioned earlier that sometimes you give Slade money to I guess manage some of the anxiety or some of the problems that, of keeping some of the peace in the family. 

00:15:50
DARRYLIN Oh, yes. He'll ask me for money and um, I really don't want to give him money but I do because he really gets terribly angry if I say no. And it seems to me that's an easy way to keeping him happy. I can't really afford to give him money but I just don't know what else to do. Because he does get very aggressive if I say no. 

00:16:15
Discuss Present Ways of Coping 

00:16:20
LISA So, Darrylin, it sounds like it's been really stressful and really difficult. How are you coping with all of this? 

00:16:25
DARRYLIN Well sometimes I really yell and scream, and I just totally lose it. I, I just try to make him stop using drugs. I even please with him. Um, I sometimes get so angry and it really doesn't do a lot of good because he just gets absolutely furious and abusive. 

00:16:50
Explore Effectiveness of Coping Strategies 

00:16:50
LISA So when you do this, when you do actually find yourself emotionally pleading and begging with him, and perhaps asking him to stop, you're saying that it doesn't work. 

00:17:00
DARRYLIN No, don't feel like it works. It just uh, it makes the situation worse because he, he gets so angry. But I don't know what else to do. I, I mean, I just get so upset. And I just find I scream and yell at him because I don't want him to use drugs. 

00:17:20
Common Ways of Coping 

00:17:20
LISA There um, there some common ways of coping that have been identified by some um, by somebody that's developed this model up for families. And I thought I might share that with you because I think that's quite important. A lot of people actually, you know, when they're dealing with the moment are quite emotional and often find themselves pleading or bargaining or trying to actually stop the behavior. 

00:17:45
DARRYLIN Yes. 

00:17:45
Common Ways of Coping: 1. Engaged 

00:17:45
LISA And it tends to come for families, it tends to come form the idea that you aught to be able to change Slade or you aught to do something to try and stop the situation. 

00:17:55
DARRYLIN Mm-hmm. 

00:17:55
Common Ways of Coping: 2. Tolerant 

00:17:55
Common Ways of Coping: 3: Withdrawal 

00:17:55
LISA Another way is, is some families do anything sometime to try to avoid the conflict and try to keep the peace. And it's, it's I guess to a level of tolerance to what's going on. And that's actually a really common reaction. And finally withdrawing from the conflict is quite common as well. 

00:18:15
DARRYLIN Right. 

00:18:15
Assessing Advantages and Disadvantages of Coping Strategies 

00:18:15
LISA What are some of the advantages of the way that you're currently coping, like keeping the peace at the moment or perhaps sometimes removing yourself from the situation. You've got some, I mean what are some of the advantages that you can see coping this way. 

00:18:30
DARRYLIN Um, well. I think it keeps everything calmer at home. 

00:18:40
LISA And that's quite important. 

00:18:40
DARRYLIN Um, I feel there's less stress on me if, if I can keep it calmer there's less stress on me. And Lowanna and Slade don't argue as much, so I think it's important that I keep things calm. And uh, that's probably the main thing I think. 

00:19:05
LISA And very valid and you know, quite good in the moment at times, isn't it. 

00:19:10
DARRYLIN Yes. 

00:19:10
LISA When you can do that. 

00:19:10
DARRYLIN Yes. 

00:19:10
LISA What about, can you think of anything, you know, some disadvantages of coping that way for you or the rest of the family or for Slade or? 

00:19:20
DARRYLIN Well, I think the disadvantage for me, it's that just I'm always turned up and I'm trying to manage everything. And I feel so tired because I'm not sleeping. And uh, I feel like I'm actually right at the end of my tether. So, I know I'm very stressed and I'm terribly depressed. I feel like I can't cope any more. It's been too much and too long. 

00:19:55
LISA So there's actually been, there's moments when you get quite a bit of piece and you feel like you're actually managing I guess control the situation to some degree. But then I'm picking up that you're on this eternal treadmill where you feel constantly turn up and quite tense and quite stressed. 

00:20:10
DARRYLIN Very. 

00:20:10
LISA Yeah, okay. 

00:20:10
Discuss Alternative Ways of Coping 

00:20:10
LISA Is, have you ever done anything that's actually worked in that, in that situation? 

00:20:15
DARRYLIN Well, you know, sometimes in the afternoon when he's just waking up. He's actually, that's probably the best time. And if I talk to him then sometimes we can, you know, we used to be really close. So if I talk to him then um, you know, we have some moments when it's okay and I feel like then if I talk to him about not taking drugs he'll agree that it's a really bad thing that he's doing. And I sometimes feel like maybe he'll think about doing something like, I've asked him to go into rehab and you know, to go somewhere to get some help. 

00:21:05
LISA So, there's been windows of opportunity that you've taken when he's actually sobered up and, and calmed down. 

00:21:10
DARRYLIN Yes. 

00:21:10
LISA So, perhaps in terms of coping that are some of the better things that work in your family. To make sure you're not confronting when he's actually been using or he's abusing you. 

00:21:20
DARRYLIN Yes. 

00:21:20
LISA Wait till he calms down. And then if you want to reason with him or explore something with him then you, then you wait till he's in a good mood or. 

00:21:30
DARRYLIN Yeah. 

00:21:30
LISA Or waking up after he's sleep. 

00:21:30
DARRYLIN Yeah, it does seem to work better in that. Yeah. 

00:21:35
LISA And going out in the garden? 

00:21:40
DARRYLIN Going out in the garden is my savior, yes. I really enjoy gardening and uh, you know, I have a friend and she also gardens. So, we swap plants and things so that's great. I, yeah, that's my savior. 

00:21:50
LISA So some of the better coping strategies let's say in your family, is perhaps waiting for him to calm down, looking after yourself more, reaching out to others, going out with your friend. 

00:22:05
DARRYLIN Yes. 

00:22:05
LISA Working in the garden and caring for yourself. What about the rest of your family? 

00:22:15

Providing Information About Positive Coping Strategies 

00:22:20
LISA You know, how I was telling you earlier about three distinct ways of coping for families. There are some ways that, that um, has been identified as, as I guess good coping strategies for families. And they're not miracles but they're, they're three things. One is um, assertive confrontation. You know, with Slade and that's what you're actually doing when you, when he calms down and you're able to have a chat with him. When he's not intoxicated I guess. And that basically expressing how you feel, what you'd like to see happen. Um, letting him know, I guess sometimes, you know, you love him and all those types of things. 

00:23:00
DARRYLIN Yes, yes. 

00:23:00
LISA The other thing, of course, is called supporting him and not supporting his drug use. But supporting him as part of the family. So always including him on family bar-b-ques or picnics. 

00:23:15
DARRYLIN I do, do that. 

00:23:15
LISA That's fantastic. 

00:23:15
DARRYLIN Yeah, I do, do that. He still makes it difficult though because sometimes when he does come, he's so rude. That I wonder why I do. But I do include him, I do love him and I try to include him so he doesn't feel pushed out. 

00:23:40
LISA That's fantastic. And the other way of course, is, is carrying for yourself. Which is a coping strategy that you do really well. 

00:23:45
DARRYLIN What with my gardening, you mean. 

00:23:50
LISA Mmm, mmm. What else do you think could be helpful for you in terms of coping with Slade?

Step Four Identifying Social Supports 

00:24:00
LISA Darrylin, you mentioned earlier that you have a wonderful friend that you talk to and who just listens and doesn't try to give you advice. 

00:24:00
DARRYLIN Yes, yeah. 

00:24:00
LISA Who else do you have around you that's supportive? 

00:24:00
DARRYLIN Um, I have my mum. And uh, I spend a bit of time with her. So, she's very supportive She's of course, really upset about Slade but I feel she's very supportive. She tries to help me as much as she can. And um, who else would I have. I don't really think there's anyone else because, like I said to you, you know, my friends are their friends. I just don't go there so much because they want me to do things I don't want to do, I don't understand. 

00:24:55
LISA Well, what, I'm interested in your other children about how, you know, what social supports that they have in this sit-, you know, to help them with this. have they got good connections with people like you're mum. 

00:25:05
DARRYLIN Yes, yes. 

00:25:05
LISA Or their own friends? 

00:25:05
DARRYLIN We're, we're quite a close family.

Step Five Identifying Specialist Help 

00:25:10
LISA So, Darrylin, you know, there are parent and family support groups in the community. There are, there are many that are run by professional agencies like ourselves here. And what we can do at the end this is um, provide you with some information that you can go away with and follow up. And perhaps with a bit of counseling here and some support from other parents it might be really helpful for you. 

00:25:45
DARRYLIN Yes, I think it would be. 

00:25:45
LISA The other thing I'd like to mention is to you, your other children. And, and the amount of conflict that is happening at home, I guess is some of the depression that your experiencing or some of the tension. Do you think it would be a good idea to perhaps offer for them to come in and be part of this? 

00:26:00
DARRYLIN Well, I could offer. I know, my daughter wouldn't come. There's no way. Um, but my younger son I think he would, he would come in. He would come with me. Um, but my daughter wouldn't come because she's, she would be too angry. She wouldn't come with me. 

00:26:25
LISA Mmm. And of course, there's other places where, that, that your children can go to. It doesn't have to happen, it doesn't have to be here, of course. What about Slade do you think he would come here? 

00:26:40
DARRYLIN I don't think so. I'd like to make him come in. Um, but I don't think he would come. Um, I'll try to get them to come in. I'll ask them. I'm not confident about the two older ones. 

00:26:55
LISA That's okay. I just think it would be a good idea to check up with them about how they going, how they feeling. 

00:27:00
DARRYLIN Yeah. 

00:27:00
LISA Give them the opportunity to speak. 

00:27:05
DARRYLIN Okay. Mm-hmm. 

00:27:05
LISA Just like you and I spoken today. 

00:27:05
DARRYLIN You think it would help us? 

00:27:05
LISA I think it would be helpful for everybody, yes. 

00:27:10
DARRYLIN Yeah. 

00:27:10
LISA Because then you can get a clear picture of what's going on. 

00:27:10
DARRYLIN Yeah. 

00:27:10
LISA Your other children will get a chance to speak up and say how they're feeling about all this.
