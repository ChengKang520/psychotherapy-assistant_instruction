JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Good morning, my name is Jennifer Cohen Harper. Thank you, for joining me today to talk about Yoga and mindfulness based tools to help the children in your life managing anxiety and navigate challenging situations. We're gonna discuss our strength based approach today to meeting anxiety that focuses on transforming the internal sense of capacity for our clients and our students and which serves everyone not just those with anxiety disorders but anyone that's experiencing stress on a daily basis even us. Let's take a moment just to get settled into this space. So wherever you are whether you're sitting on the floor or in a chair perfectly fine, just settle into that spot a little bit, get comfortable bring your hands on to your lap, put whatever you're holding, writing with, drinking out of, just put it down, rest your hands, let your body relax, if it feels good to close your eyes close your eyes. And then just listen to the sound of your breath for about 30 seconds and then we'll dive in. 

00:01:25

00:02:10
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Okay. So what is anxiety? All children and adults for that matter experience anxiety in their lives, right, that sense of umm… a rapid heart beat, an upset stomach, maybe shaking hands or sweating palms, and when your body wants to tell you that anxiety is present, it usually does so loud and clear. There's no mistaking or ignoring the feeling of anxiety. And as we talk about how to manage your children's capacity for anxiety and how to navigate stressful situations it's really important that we remember that anxiety is absolutely normal. The feeling, the experience of anxiety is something that everyone has. It's a normal part of life and just like all of our other emotions anxiety is trying to tell us something. Anxiety is giving us information, it serves a purpose. At times anxiety can even help us, can even help us prepare uh… our body for what's coming next. So it's important to start from this place of anxiety is normal. We can never get rid of all anxiety. What we need to learn to do is manage it so that we can walk forward in the world from a place of strength. Anxiety is the body's way of telling us something important to us is at stake, and we're feeling unsure about our ability to manage that challenge, our ability to handle what's coming and so think about that for a second, anxiety is the body's way of telling us something important to us is at stake, and we're feeling unsure about our ability to manage the challenge, but what a lot of people especially kids experience as anxiety is the message of "Something's wrong, I can't handle it." Right, so this information that they get they often interpret it as "Oh, No! Something's wrong. This is coming. I can't take it." It's a message that gets stronger and stronger if we try to push it away, right. This message of anxiety "There's something's wrong, I can't handle it" message, if we try to push it away the body just keeps trying to send us that message over and over and over again and often it grows, but if we can listen to that message, if we can receive it, if we can interpret it instead as something important to me is at stake, right, that initial message is the same, something important to me is at stake. I'm nervous about my ability to handle it Time to get my A game on, right. Then we can manage and even thrive. Those messages of anxiety we can interpret them as something's wrong, I can't handle it or something important to me is at stake, I better bring everything I have got to this situation. When we can help shift our kids to that type of mindset they can thrive even under stressful situations. Our kids, our students, our clients, our own children, our kids have resources, resources for managing challenging situations. They have internal resources like their body, their breath, their mind, right, and they have external resources like family, friends, other support systems, you, and our kids have resources, and what they need to learn to do in order to manage anxiety is identify those research… resources, strengthen those resources and then learn and practice harnessing those resources when anxiety is rising. Helping children connect to their inner resources can create a mindset shift, a mindset shift that transforms anxiety into information that can help transform what is often perceived as a threat into something that's perceived as a challenge and can help us transform fear into courage, fear into the capacity to act. When anxiety is rising, right, when those messages of the body are getting stronger and stronger and anxiety becomes this rising tide in our bodies the message that your kids need to hear from you, the message that kids need to hear from the adults around them isn't "Let's get rid of this anxiety, this anxiety is a problem, let's get rid of this bad anxiety." That's not the message they need, right. The message that they need is "Your body is telling you something important. I see and understand how hard this is, I really do. I see and understand how hard it is. I also know that you are absolutely up for this challenge, and I'm here for you." So I'm gonna say that one more time the message that our kids need to hear from us when their anxiety is rising isn't "Let's get rid of the anxiety." It's "Your body's trying to tell you something important. I see and understand how hard this is. I know that you're strong enough to handle this. I am right here, and I'm not going anywhere." This "I'm here for you" part of that response is extremely important. Often as adults we want to teach children tools to manage anxiety on their own in the "real world" right. We want them to be able to handle the challenging situations when we're not there. But anxiety is magnified by a sense of isolation, right. The feeling of being alone magnifies anxiety. And anxiety is diminished by a sense of connection, strong connection especially, connection to a caring competent adult, right. When our children are feeling stressed, threatened, over whelmed, the presence of a calm compassionate loving adult provides them with a beacon of stability. It gives them a source of strength and a remainder of what their resources are. Kids who feel like someone has their back can walk through the world with more confidence even when that person isn't standing right by their side. There is absolutely no downside, none, no downside to offering connection and support to an anxious child or an anxious adult for that matter. We're all on this journey together and despite the sort of umm… rugged individual as a message of our culture our biology is one of interdependence, right. We're built to be social creatures, and the healthy development of your kids resilience system depends on that connection. Give your kids tools. Teach them about their inner resources. We're gonna spend the next, you know, 80 minutes or so talking about how to strengthen them, but don't ever forget that one of those resources is you. Okay. So I'm just gonna pause there for a moment. We do have the capacity to take questions from the webinar audience uh… so if anybody has any questions either at this time or going forward don't hesitate to send them on in and not get passed along to me. So I'm just gonna pause for a moment if anybody has any questions. 

00:09:25
[sil.] 

00:09:35
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Anything coming in? Okay. So nothing's coming in right now so I'll move forward, uh… but just, you know, if anything's arising that you don't feel quite ready to ask feel free to jot it down, and if anything comes out throughout the course of the seminar know that I'll pause a couple of other times throughout, umm… throughout these 90 minutes to take questions. Okay. So let's talk about agency, let's talk about personal power, okay. Have you ever had an experience uh… where… Have you ever noticed that anxiety and excitement share many of the same physical sensations? Maybe you've had an experience where you're getting ready to do something challenging or something hard, and you can almost feel in your body that you could go either way, right, you could give in to the nervous or you can go to the excitement. Right, those two things have a lot in common. The, the belly flutters, the rapid heart beat, the feeling of wanting to move our bodies. In many ways there is a very fine line between anxiety and nervousness. So what is it that makes the difference for a child or teen between, for example, the anxiety that comes before a test versus the excitement before a big game or the anxiety of getting up to speak in class versus the excitement of being in a class play for example? Well, before the game, before the performance there certainly is anxiety, right. It's in there, but the tilt towards excitement is rooted in the child's belief that they are up to the task ahead, right, the overarching experience becomes one of nervous anticipation rather than one of nervous anxiety or even fear because the child is prepared and knows that they can do it, right, they know that they can do it. What we need to find is a way both for ourselves and our kids to develop that inner confidence that they can do it even when they don't know what it is, right. That sense that I can walk into the world and whatever's coming I trust myself enough, I believe in myself enough to know that I can find a way through it, that I can cope, that I can manage, right. This belief in our own inner capacity changes not just our feelings but our body responds as well, right. Our body responds to the belief in our mind connecting with a sense of personal power allows our nervous system to interpret the upcoming experience as a challenge rather than a threat, right. Whenever there is something new happening our body is always asking this question "Threat? Challenge? Threat? Challenge?" And we want as much as possible to encourage the challenge interpretation, right. When we interpret something coming as a challenge rather than a threat our body responds accordingly. In both cases our sympathetic nervous system is activated, right. The sympathetic nervous system sometimes called the fight-or-flight response in both cases a challenge or a threat this sympathetic nervous system engages to help give us energy, uh… fully engage all of our senses, sharpen our focus, but when we interpret what's coming as a threat our nervous system also limits our access to our prefrontal cortex umm… with the kids I call that the thoughtful brain, and our behavior is driven by what I call the protective brain, the part of the brain that is working on instinct, that's very reactive, that's always asking "Am I safe? Am I safe?" umm… and is determined to keep us safe in the present moment. That part of the brain becomes very strong and then our behavior, right, when we interpret what's coming as a threat our behavior is driven by instinct, and it's very reactive, okay. By contrast when we interpret an upcoming experience as a challenge that we have the capacity to handle we can retain access to our thoughtful brain, and we get that energy boost from that sympathetic nervous system engagement, but we retain access to the thoughtful brain so we can harness the energy and the power that our nervous system is providing which is often substantial without losing touch with our intentions and our capacity for thoughtful action. We gain the power of the sympathetic nervous system engagement, but we can still have the clarity umm… to, to skillfully manage what's in front of us. So those same physical sensations, right, those physical sensations of your heart beating faster, your belly engaging, your muscles tightening, those physical sensations can be interpreted as threat or a challenge. They can be read as our body giving us information that something is important, that something important is at stake, and when we experience and interpret what's coming as a challenge we can interpret those sensations as our body giving us the energy we need for the task ahead rather than our body sort of freaking out and making us incapable of doing anything well. So it's very important as I've said that our kids know they have inner resources. You can't use your inner resources if you don't know that you have inner resources, so our kids need to know that they have inner resources. They need to practice using those inner resources, and they need to develop the felt sense, right, not just the intellectual sense but the felt embodied sense that they can have an impact on their own lives, on their own experience of the, of their lives and on the world around them. They need to understand that they have an impact on themselves and the world. Now for children experiencing frequent anxiety, for kids with anxiety disorders umm… there are choices that need to be made about how to move forward depending on the circumstances that are happening when anxiety arises. Sometimes anxiety needs us to gather more information about what's going on right now, right. Sometimes anxiety is rising, and we don't even really have a handle on the situation. Sometimes anxiety is telling us "Alright, check out what's going on, get some more information, see what's happening." Sometimes uh… when anxiety is rising what it really needs is for us to check it out, recognize that we're okay, right, when we actually are okay, when we're safe. Sometimes the anxiety needs us to say, "Okay, you know, I'm okay right now." And anxiety needs us to help out our nervous system to help our nervous system settle down a little, and then at other times anxiety is telling us "Get ready! A big challenge is coming." And anxiety is helping us and telling us "You need to harness your power, harness the energy that your nervous system is giving you right now, and work on transforming this possible threat into a challenge." You can help the kids in your life learn to read and interpret their anxiety and choose a course of action that's best for them in the moment. We're gonna explore today how the practices of yoga and mindfulness can support each of these possible paths forward. So for the rest of our time together we're gonna explore practices that can support our capacity to manage and even harness our anxiety. We're gonna do activities that help us connect to the world around us, uh… activities that help us learn to listen better to our own body and activities that teach our mind how strong we are. The practices that follow are all based on the Little Flower yoga five element structures that you see on the slide in front of you this framework of connect, breathe, move, focus and relax. We're gonna do activities that fall within each of those five elements. Now this structure is designed to support uh… a complete mind body experience in a developmentally appropriate easy to implement way. We're gonna start with a connect practice. Now I'm gonna give you a moment uh… just to kind of get situated in your space. As we move forward throughout the rest of our seminar uh… we're primarily gonna be doing practices. Several of them will be seated practices, a couple of them will be standing practices. You don't necessarily need a yoga mat uh… but if you have one handy it wouldn't hurt. You're absolutely fine sitting on the floor or sitting in a chair, you can leave your shoes on, take them off, all of those things are fine. Now what I'm gonna do is for each of the activities I'm mean to ask that the first time I talk through the activity you just really dive into participating. Put down your notes, your paper whatever you've got moving on just put it down, and have the experience, feel the experience in your own body. And then after we have the experience together I promise I will repeat what I did so that you can take notes if you'd like, okay. So I'm gonna pause for about 10 seconds to let you get situated, and then we'll dive into a connect activity. 

00:19:00
[sil.] 

00:19:15
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER So connect activities are about connecting both to the self and to the world around us. This first practice that we're gonna do together is called a five senses awareness practice, and it's largely about connecting with the world. So put down whatever you've got in your hands, and then find a comfortable way to sit. Sometimes I tell the kids uh… when I first, the first time I'm with the kids I'll talk about what do I mean when I say find a comfortable way to sit or take a comfortable seat. Uh… if you've been to a yoga or meditation class umm… you may think like take a comfortable seat is code for like do this with your body and, you know, some special thing, but really when I tell the kids or you to sit comfortably all I'm asking is try to sit in a way that minimizes the distraction of your body. Often this means umm… finding the middle. So a lot of times we're pretty comfortable like leaning to one side or leaning forward. But what would happen if you tried to stay in that kind of leaning position say for four or five minutes? You probably couldn't stay there comfortably. So often finding a comfortable way to sit just means finding the middle, so maybe do a little forward and back, side to side, and see if you can find your center where your body is as comfortable as possible and offering you as little distraction as possible. And now we're gonna explore what's in the space around each of us with all five of our senses, so the first thing I'm gonna ask you to do is look around, use your sense of sight to see what is in the space around you. Now you don't have to do anything or interpret it or analyze it, just check it out. What do you see in the room, if you have a window near you look out the window what do you see? Just gather up whatever information there is to be gathered through your sense of sight. We'll take just a few moments to do that now. 

00:21:20
[sil.] 

00:22:05
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Take a last look around, and then slowly bring your eyes back either to the screen or to the ground in front of you. Just see if you can hold in your mind the memory of what you saw. What did you see in the room around you? 

00:22:25
[sil.] 

00:22:30
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And now let's pay attention to what we can hear. So my recommendation is that you close your eyes if it's comfortable for you to close your eyes go ahead and do so now. If it's not gonna work for you to close your eyes for any reason my recommendation would be either that you look down or that you look at one thing, one spot that's not moving and just softly focus on it. I would avoid looking at me or the screen that's gonna move a little bit, okay. So either down or out at one soft focus point. And then imagine you could open your ears, imagine you can expand your sense of hearing and start to gather up all of the sounds around you. Whatever's happening in your environment just let it come in, let it go, and then listen for the next sound that comes. 

00:23:20
[sil.] 

00:24:10
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Now shift your awareness to something maybe a little more subtle. Let's pay attention to what we can taste, and we don't often think about our sense of taste when we're not actively eating something, but there's always some sort of taste in your mouth so just see for a few moments if you can notice the tastes in your mouth. And notice too if those tastes change if, for example, you swallow, move your tongue around, open your mouth to inhale. Just check out what you can taste for about 30 seconds. 

00:24:50
[sil.] 

00:25:25
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Now keeping your eyes closed if they're closed or softly focused. If they're looking at one point start to pay attention to what you can smell. Take a few full breaths in through your nose. See if you can notice any smells, good, bad, neutral in your environment 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:26:40
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And finally start to notice what you can feel. Start to explore your sense of touch. Where do you feel your body connecting to the ground or your chair, where can you feel pressure in your body. Sometimes when I do this practice I like to scan through my body starting with my feet moving up noticing where my body feels tension or discomfort, where there are places at ease in my body, can also notice things like the temperature or the feeling of any wind in the room, alright. What can you feel? What is your sense of touch telling you right now? 

00:27:25
[sil.] 

00:28:15
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Go ahead and open your eyes or look up. 

00:28:20
[sil.] 

00:28:25
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER So that was our five senses awareness practice. Now I ask you to take just about 60 seconds right now, about a minute. Just uh… write down your own experience of that practice so you can maybe think through uh… what did I hear, what did I see, what was that experience like, what did it feel like to pay attention to each one of your senses or maybe a more overall feeling of what was my experience like having completed that practice. Right, so just one minute to take some notes about your personal experience of doing that practice, and then I'll repeat what the practice was so you can take notes on that if you need to. 

00:29:05
[sil.] 

00:29:35
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER So finish up whatever you're writing now. We'll bring your attention back together. So what we just did was check in with the present moment, right. We brought our awareness and our attention to what was real in the present moment. We grounded ourselves in the environment around us. We gave the protective part of the brain exactly what it wants which is the opportunity to use all of our senses to scan for a threat, to orient to where we are. And so we practice staying connected to what's real often anxiety comes in and takes us out of the present moment, out of what's real, and we need to actively help our kids re-enter what is happening for them right in this moment. So what we did uh… was just brought awareness to each of the five senses. Usually I start with a sense of sight uh… because after that we can close our eyes and go through the rest of the senses in a way that feels kind of like it naturally flows together. So I started with asking you what can you see, just look around and find everything there is to see in the world around you, in your environment right now. And then I invited you to close your eyes. Now it's important to remember that for some of your kids closing their eyes won't feel safe. They won't want to close their eyes, they'll be uncomfortable when they close their eyes. It's really important that you always provide an alternative every single time you say "Close your eyes." Give an option either to look down, to look out and stare at one thing that's not moving. Okay, so I invited you to close your eyes or choose a focus point and then bring your attention to what you could hear. Imagine opening your ears as wide as you can and listening to all the sounds in your environment. And then we moved to taste and then to smell. And then finally to touch, what can you feel? Now it's okay if you kind of change the order, if you forget the order of, of what you hear, what you taste, what you smell, but I would recommend that you always end with what you feel because bringing our awareness to our bodies to the, the felt sensation of our body in the present moment umm… is a nice way to end. It's a very grounding kind of "Oh, I'm right here. I'm right here," way to close out the practice. So I definitely recommend that you always end with what can you feel, and have your kids bring their awareness to the part of their body that's touching the floor. Sometimes for my kids with umm… extreme anxiety, if I have kids who are really, really struggling I might even ask them to take off their shoes and deliberately press their feet into the floor. Sometimes press their hands into the floor too because what we're trying to do is energetically ground them in the present moment literally connect them with the ground and remind them you are right here in the present moment right now, okay. So I'm gonna pause just for a moment and see if any questions have come in. Do we have any questions? No, we are good, okay. Alright, so this connect practice, five senses awareness practice umm… when anxiety is present umm… or you think anxiety might be coming umm… but the child doesn't really recognize the source of the anxiety, what the anxiety is trying to tell them, that sort of a defused nebulous anxiety. This is a practice that can help, it's like "Hey, is something in my environment causing me anxiety? Where am I right now? Oh, okay, I'm here, and this is what I'm dealing with." Alright, so we're gonna move on now to talking about our breath. Our breath is one of our absolute most powerful resources, one of our most powerful inner resources. The way that we're breathing is continuously sending messages to our brain and our nervous system. Changing our breath is one of the most direct ways to change our physiological response to anxiety. The breath and the nervous system have like a direct connection to each other. When we inhale through our nose and slow down our exhale, right. So a practice of inhaling through the nose and then slowly exhale down, exhaling as long as possible it sends a message to our brain, to our nervous system that we're okay, there's no emergence here, right. Think about umm… when there is an emergency, right, when you're running away from something scary or there's a real emergency, think about how you would be breathing, right. Usually if there's a real emergency you're breathing fast through your mouth, right, as an attempt to get more oxygen into your blood more quickly. When you deliberately breathe through your nose you send a message to your nervous system "There is no emergency here, you're okay" right. We can use this practice. We can use this breath work practice to calm physical anxiety symptoms, to tell the brain and the nervous system there is nothing scary going on right now, to calm the physical symptoms of anxiety and gain the awareness that we need to engage our thoughtful brain, right. Calming some of that physiology of the nervous system response just settling down enough to kind of take the edge off can allow us to remember "Oh, this can be a threat or a challenge." And give us that little bit of space to access the thoughtful brain, investigate what anxiety is trying to tell us and approach the situation as a challenge rather than a threat. This is really different I have to say this is really different from ignoring or trying to push anxiety away. So what I'm talking about is not some attempt to kind of squash all of what our body is telling us and ignore the anxiety. Instead it's an active use of a powerful resource is an… It has to be rooted in this acknowledgment. Okay, this anxiety is arising. It's trying to tell me something. I feel it getting a little edgy, a little fanatic, a little out of control. I'm gonna use this powerful inner resource to take the edge off, right, not like squash it and push it away, just get myself to a place where I have the capacity to access my thoughtful brain, and it's important that our kids hear us use language and, and that our intention is one of "You can manage this, you can harness this. You have resources, not let's get rid of this anxiety here are the tricks" right. If our kids start to think that the point, the goal is to get rid of the anxiety all together they're always gonna feel like they're failing because it's impossible, it's impossible to just push our anxiety aside. So instead the breath is a resource to settle our bodies enough to access our thoughtful brain, okay. So what we're gonna practice together today is something called resistance breathing. We're gonna do two different versions of this. So the first is very simple, and it's based on inhaling through the nose and then slowly exhaling through the mouth. And this is a practice that you can do with any age kids even your very young preschool age kids, and then after we do that we're gonna do another practice that's just based on nose breathing. And it's called an Ujjayi breath, and that's really for your kids who are a little bit older, okay. So put all of your things down. If you're writing put it down, drinking put it down. Get comfortable in your seat. Again that just means, you know, find the middle, reduce the distraction of your body. And if it's okay for you close your eyes. If it's not gonna work for you to close your eyes, you can look down or you can look up and out. Now for breath work practice there's definitely an advantage to looking up and out and finding something in front of you to stare at because when we look down we close off the throat a little bit. So if you're really breathing very intentionally you want to keep that throat open so you're not umm… kind of artificially constricting your airway. So just choose what to do with your eyes. I'm gonna close my eyes for a moment. Now I'll say as a side note if I was with kids, if I was in a room with actual children. I would not close my eyes. You really want to know what your kids are doing. So don't get sucked into kind of doing the practices with them and closing your eyes because they could be like up and out of the room before you know it, okay. But I'm gonna close my eyes for a moment, and if it feels comfortable for you, you can do that too. And start to pay attention to your breath. Start to notice how you're breathing right now. Don't change yet, don't do anything yet. Just notice your breath. Are you breathing through your mouth or your nose? Is your inhale long or your exhale longer? Does your breath feel smooth and natural or is there a choppiness or an edginess to it? Maybe you feel congested or uncomfortable, if you do go ahead and grab a tissue blow your nose before you start breathing more deliberately. Just notice what's going on with your breath right now. 

00:39:00
[sil.] 

00:39:10
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And now start to intentionally breathe through your nose. So just pay attention to the feeling of breathing in through your nose and then as you breathe out create some resistance like purse your lips, make that opening small and slow your breath down. So just breathe and freely, naturally feel your breath come in, and then purse your lips, and slow your exhale down. Go whatever pace works for you to look like this. 

00:39:45
[sil.] 

00:39:50
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER It's okay if you hear a little whispering sound on your exhale. Just go a few cycles inhaling through your nose and slowing down your exhale through pursed lips. 

00:40:05
[sil.] 

00:40:30
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER As you breathe in this way just notice any feelings or sensations that you have in your body. 

00:40:35
[sil.] 

00:40:45
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Take one more full inhale. And one more slow long exhale. 

00:40:55
[sil.] 

00:41:00
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Okay. So this is a very simple resistance breath that you can do with any age of kids. It's a great pattern, a great habit for kids to get into the, into the habit of lengthening the exhale, okay. Now there's another practice that I'm gonna introduce you to called an Ujjayi breath. Now I don't usually introduce an Ujjayi breath to kids under about 10 to 12 years old and even then, you know, some kids get it right away and other kids it just takes a little longer, same with adults. So I'm gonna introduce it to you if it's not working out for you to do it right now don't worry about it. Try it this afternoon, try it tomorrow. It's a little bit of umm… it's like one of those things kind of like umm… riding a bike, you know, you try a million times, you try and you don't have your balance, you try and you fall, you try and you wobbly, you try and it's weird and then all of a sudden at one point you try and you're like, "Oh! Why was it so hard to do this before?" Ujjayi breath is a little bit like that. Once you get it you got it, but sometimes it takes a few times to try. Okay, so in this practice of Ujjayi breathing we're gonna inhale and exhale through the nose, but we need to create that little bit of resistance, right, that resistance especially on the exhale is what helps us slow down the exhale and really engage our relaxation response. So how can we slow down the exhale? How can we engage resistance when we can't change the, the shape or size of our nose the way that we can the mouth? What we're gonna do is in an Ujjayi breath find just a little bit of constriction in our airway, okay. So it's something that sounds a little weird, but I introduce it anyway because it's a very powerful practice once it clicks in. So what I'm gonna ask you to do first is just experiment a little with making umm… a kind of ocean sound or like a Darth Vader sound with your mouth open. So just breathe in and then… You can try it again, you can even try making that sound on your inhale. Just try that a few times, and see if you can notice, see if you can feel what you have to do in your throat in order to make that whispery Darth Vader kind of sound. Now what we're gonna do is try to make that same exact sound. It's gonna be quieter but we're gonna make the same sound breathing in and out through our noses. So we're gonna find that same constriction that just slight constriction in your throat, but you're gonna breathe in and out through your nose. It's gonna be something like this. I'm not sure if you can hear me on the video, but I'm gonna try, okay. 

00:43:40
[sil.] 

00:43:55
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER So just try that for a few moments. If you try it breathing through your nose and you're not quite catching that on constriction that sound just switch to trying through your mouth a few times. You can get the feeling of it, and then switch back to breathing through your nose. I'm gonna be quiet for just about 15 or 20 seconds to let you explore that. 

00:44:20
[sil.] 

00:44:40
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Okay, so just to recap what we just did it was first resistance breathing where you inhaled freely through your nose, and then slowed your exhale down through pursed lips, and then we switched to Ujjayi breath which is a similar experience but breathing in and out through the nose where you inhale and exhale through the nose but with that little constriction at the back of the throat that slows the breath down. Both of those are uh… examples of resistance breathing that can help engage your parasympathetic nervous system sometimes called your relaxation response. Uh… I do the former with kids from, really from about three years old right up through adults. And umm… the Ujjayi breathing I would introduce as an experiment to kids, you know, between about 10 and 12 years old not expecting that they're necessarily gonna get it right away uh… but just introducing it and experimenting with it, okay. So now we're gonna talk about movement. Uh… Movement offers us a tremendous opportunity to explore the resource that is our body, right, and to connect with our own sense of strength and capacity. We're gonna look at two different types of movement today. I'm gonna do one that specifically addresses the idea of personal agency. I have control over how my own body feels. I have input into my own experience of life. And then we're gonna do another that illustrates how uh… a felt sense of strength in our bodies, in our physical body can translate to reduced anxiety and an increased sense of inner strength as well. I'm just gonna take a minute to kind of adjust my space in a way that will better suit movement. You can do the same at home. You don't need a ton of space, and you don't necessarily need a yoga mat, uh… but you do want the area where you can stand up and move around just a little bit. So I'm gonna set up my space while you set up yours. 

00:46:35
[sil.] 

00:46:55
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And then once you've got your space set up we're gonna meet in mountain pose. So we're gonna stand up. Separate your feet about hip with apart, check in make sure knees aren't locked, get a little bit taller. Turn your palms to face forward. And I always like to give my shoulders a little shake out, make sure they're not up by my ears. And then if it feels okay for you close your eyes, if not just look at one spot that's not moving. This is mountain pose. First just take a moment. And start to finish up your scan. 

00:47:40
[sil.] 

00:47:45
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Now we're gonna do something called waking up the body. So if your eyes are closed you can go ahead and open them. What we're gonna do is move our body through a range of motion. Again starting with our feet moving up to our head we're just gonna move each part of our body. Now you can move exactly the way I'm moving or you can move in whatever way feels good for you. I'm gonna start by wiggling my toes if you've got shoes on no big deal just wiggle your toes right inside your shoes. Then I'm gonna start leaning forward and back a little, maybe side to side and just wake up the bottoms of my feet. And I'm gonna make some circles with my ankles, first one direction and then the other and then switch sides. Now I'm gonna let me knees get in on it a little swing and one leg and the other. Maybe try some knee bends. Notice if your body's talking to you a little bit. We're gonna start to bring my hips into the movement here, maybe with some circle. Then keep moving your hips and forward back, maybe side to side, be aware that it's highly likely that your kids and your teens will move their hips with a little bit more exuberance than you are. Uh… just be prepared for it, don't over analyze it, okay. Now I'm gonna let my torso get in on the action. See what your torso wants to do? For me it always feels really good to do a little side to side swing, but if you've got kids in close quarter just recognize that they might umm… bang into each other if they do this. Maybe some big arm circles, again always good to remind your kids not to whack each other in the face. 

00:49:45
[sil.] 

00:49:50
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Gonna let that movement comes right into my elbows and my wrists even my fingers. Okay, alright, and now I'm gonna start to move my neck. So for me it feels really good to bring my head down and side to side, but it doesn't feel so good to bring it all the way back so I just don't do that. 

00:50:20
[sil.] 

00:50:25
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Okay, maybe do a little side to side, little yes, no action. 

00:50:30
[sil.] 

00:50:35
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Okay, and then finally it's gonna be time to wake up the muscles of our face. You ready? 

00:50:40
[sil.] 

00:50:45
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER The more ridiculous the better. It's good if your kids are laughing. 

00:50:50
[sil.] 

00:50:55
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Alright, get your face muscles woken up, and then anything else in your body that needs to move, any other part of your body that you want to move, move it now and then meet back in mountain pose. 

00:51:10
[sil.] 

00:51:20
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And then as we meet back in mountain pose we're going to start a second body scan. So one more time we're gonna check in with each part of our body starting with the feet moving up to our heads, and your task is just to notice if this mountain pose feels any different from your first mountain pose. 

00:51:40
[sil.] 

00:52:20
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Start to finish up your scan. 

00:52:25
[sil.] 

00:52:30
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER When you're ready open your eyes. Now you can go ahead back down to sit down uh… with the kids I usually transition to sitting through something called a tiptoe pose. I bring my arms up, out uh… sorry out and out, come up on to my toes and then lower down, down, down, down, down. Sometimes I'll do a little and back up and lower, lower, lower, lower up. And keep lower and all the way down and then make your way to sit. Now take about one minute to jot down how your second mountain pose felt in relation to your first. Normally, if I was with children or teens right now I would ask them "Did your second mountain pose feel any different from your first pose?" First we'll just do a show of hands and the vast majority of people, kids and adults alike will raise their hand and say, "Yes, my second mountain pose felt different from my first." Okay, and then I ask "What felt different?" So I'm gonna ask you that. What felt different? What was different from your second mountain pose to your first mountain pose? Just take about one minute to write down those answers for yourself. 

00:53:45
[sil.] 

00:54:15
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Okay, finish up with your writing. Now when I ask the kids how does your second mountain pose feel different from your first mountain pose. I get a huge variety of answers. Sometimes the kids say "My second mountain felt taller" or "My second mountain felt steadier." Especially the kids who choose to close their eyes they often notice they're wobbling less in the second mountain pose. Sometimes they say "My mountain felt bigger." But then you also get them saying things like "My mountain felt bigger." "No, my mountain felt smaller." Uh… they say completely kind of off the wall things like "My mountain is purple now." There's a wide variety of responses you might get to the question of how did your second mountain feel different from your first, and they're all fine. Just absorb them. The thing that you want to recognize about a practice like this is not "Oh, I could manipulate the way that I'm feeling, and I could make the whole room feel this way." It's not about everyone having the same experience. What you want to notice for yourself and point out to the kids is "Hey, I felt one way that I did a bunch of stuff that I decided to do that's within my own control, and now I feel a little different." Right, that's agency, and it might seem very, very simple but our kids don't necessarily know that their choices have an impact on how they experience the world. They need to be given opportunities to experience that, and told "Hey, you did that" right. Often our kids are walking through the world assuming that the way they're feeling is the result of the input "My mom's having a bad day, so I'm having a bad day." Right, whatever's out there in the world is coming in and causing them to feel the way they're feeling. They need simple concrete felt experiences of "Hey, I felt one way. I did something that I decided to do that's within my control, and now I feel different in the same environment." And that's called agency. Okay, now we're gonna do one more movement practice. We're gonna do a variation of something called warrior one. We're gonna do uh… it's a strength based practice we're gonna stand up again to do it. Umm… What I want to ask you to do or we're doing it is just pay close attention to how you're feeling, right. Just notice how you're feeling, and I'm gonna show you how I usually come up to stand if I'm working with kids sitting on the floor. I really like to try to manage the transitions and maximize the transitions. So what I usually do is no hands stand. So uh… feet on the floor, reach my arms out in front of me, now I have a wall behind me so I can't rock and roll, umm… but if you wanted to rock and roll you absolutely can. What I'm gonna do is reach forward, forward, forward, forward and no hand stand, okay. I'm gonna come to the front of my mat. Again if you don't have a mat it's really not a big deal just stand on the ground, start in mountain pose. Lift one knee, and step it way back behind you and then bring your back heel down to the mat, so this is like a lunge where your heel is lifted. You really want to anchor yourself by grounding that back heel and then bend your front knee just a bit. Make sure, look down check in make sure that your front me is not going past your front ankle. Now something that often happens when we come into this position is our bodies move forward, our torsos move forward, check in and notice if that's the case for you, and if it is just lift your torso so that your heart is shining up towards the ceiling. So you want to go from here to here. Now first just get steady there, find your balance. Take a breath or two. And then bring your arms up with your palms facing forward and your elbows bent, right, so you're really opening across your chest. You might even want to spread your fingers wide and see how that feels. Now start to notice what's going on in your body. How are your legs doing? Can you feel what part of your legs are working? Can you feel any other parts of your body that are working? Maybe even notice if you can feel any parts of your body relaxing. And if you're starting to feel like there is no part of my body that's relaxed right now see if you can relax any part of your body, maybe your toes or your face. 

00:59:00
[sil.] 

00:59:05
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Now finally, start to pay attention to what your breath is doing. As you notice your breath see if you can start to engage one of those resistance breathing practices we did earlier. Either breathe in through your nose and slowly out through your mouth or explore that Ujjayi breath a little bit more. 

00:59:30
[sil.] 

00:59:40
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER One more full breath in, full breath out. And bring your arms to center and down, and then take a big step forward. Shake out your legs if you need to. Now just come back to mountain pose and notice how you feeling, just check out your body, your mind, how you're doing. Now we're gonna practice on the other side. Now when we practice on the other side I'm going to be quiet. I'm just gonna let you have your own experience for a few rounds of breath in this pose, but just remember that the power of yoga comes in the noticing, right. If our mind, if we're checking out, if we're doing warrior one in front of the TV, right, we're not making those connections, especially the ones that teach our mind about how strong we are. So strive to stay as you do this try to stay connected to your own body, your own breath, your own experience rather than distracting your mind with something else. Alright so mountain pose, lift the other leg, step it back behind you and bring your back heel on to the mat, look forward make sure that front knee is over your front ankle or a little bit behind it, just not forward of it and then if your torso is pitching forward a little, lift it. Then bring your arms up. It's a variation of warrior one. We'll stay here for a few rounds of breaths. Just notice how you're feeling. 

01:01:15
[sil.] 

01:01:50
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Bring your arms back to the middle, lower them down, take a big step forward and pause for a moment in your mountain pose to check in with yourself, with your body, your breath and your mind. If you want to explore that tip toe pose on the way back down to sit, I'm just gonna bring your arms in front of you and then up, come on to your toes and then slowly lower back down. Alright, so notice how you're doing, right. How does coming into a posture that accesses our strength, right, that calls on us to notice how strong we are and that opens our bodies to the world. How does that make us feel? Just notice how it made you feel. If you're interested in learning more about the relationship between posture umm… and experience and capacity. I recommend checking out Amy Cuddy's new book. It's called "Presence: Bringing Your Biggest Self to Your Boldest Challenges" It's really very interesting, okay. So we are going to shift gears now and talk about focus activities. I'm gonna grab a cushion back. Umm… we're, we're done with movement for a little while so if you want to come back to your chair or comfortable spot on the ground you can go ahead and do so now. Alright, now in the Little Flower program practicing focus is all about noticing your mind wander, catching it and bringing it back to a fixed point, okay. It's really important that your kids hear you say "A wandering mind is totally natural" right. It is completely normal for the mind to be distracted, for the mind to wander, for thoughts to pop into your head, right, that's just gonna happen your whole life. Right, that's always gonna happen. A wandering mind is not a problem. It is a problem when we don't notice that our mind is wandering, right, when our mind just starts wandering and we're going along with it being absorbed in the wandering not even noticing that we're completely disconnected from the present. That's a problem. Wandering not a problem, not noticing that our mind is wandering can potentially cause a problem. Now if your kids think that the point of the focus activities is to lock their focus into one thing like it's in a vice grip and never let it move, they're gonna think they can't do it, and they're right. None of us can really do that, but if they think the point of focusing is just "I'm on this one thing, and it's not going anywhere. I'm, I'm putting a wall up between me and distraction." If that's the message they get about what the point is then they're gonna say, "Oh, I can't do this." You'll hear the kid say things like "Oh, I'm so ADD I can't do this." Whether or not they have an ADHD diagnosis or not they believe they can't do it. So you got to say to them "A wandering mind is natural." Minds are thought making machine, machines, and the distraction of our thoughts is something we can never stop, okay, but when we learn to notice that our mind has wandered and strengthen our capacity to bring it back to the object of our choosing we decrease our susceptibility to things like runaway worries, rumination, intrusive thoughts, all of which are very, very common in children and teens who are experiencing a lot of anxiety. And when we can notice these things happening what we can do is noticed them happening and then use the resource of our mind to make a different choice about where to put our attention. So with the kids I often use the analogy of a dumbbell, and this works well for both kids and teens. I often use the analogy of a dumbbell like, so imagine if you had a weight, and just put it down on the ground and you held onto it really, really tight, so imagine you're holding it really tight, and you're just keep holding it as tight as you can would your arm ever get stronger? No, in order to get stronger you have to pick it up, put it down, pick it up, put it down, pick it up, put it down, that's how you strengthen your bicep, right. It's the exact same thing for your attention muscle. Trying to lock your mind in a vice grip just going to give you a headache, right. But if you can notice your mind wandering, catch it and bring it back and do that over and over you're exercising your attention muscle. It's like reps of an exercise for your attention muscle. Sometimes with my kids who are really resistant and really feel like they're just terrible at focusing I'll remind them that if your mind doesn't wander you never get the opportunity to strengthen it. You've got to pick it up, put it down, okay. So now in the picture that you're looking at in the slide on the screen you see this image of a girl staring at a jar of glitter. Now that's one type of focus practice. What we're gonna do today is called single pointed focus. This is a picture of somebody practicing with a visual object, so the instructions that she's received are something like stare at that jar of glitter, it's just water and glitter, and you can shake it, and stare at that jar of glitter, let that glitter fill up your eyes and fill up your mind. Now notice when you're not thinking about glitter, any time your mind wanders and you're thinking about something but besides glitter just catch it and go "Oh! Not thinking about glitter" and bring it back. That's really as simple as that. Notice your mind wander and bring it back, okay. So a visual object is one type of focused practice that you can use to strengthen your ability to catch your mind wandering and bring it back, right, but there are others as well. And today we're gonna explore together umm… using a sensation as our object of focus. So I'm gonna give you a few different options to try here. We're gonna experiment with staying connected to the sensation of our hands on our own body. So I'm gonna give you three options. One option is just to put one hand over your heart, just make some contact with your heart, give your body a little bit of pressure as you can really feel it. The other option is to have one hand on your heart and one hand on your belly. And then finally a third option is to have one hand on your heart and one hand on your forehead. So just experiment a little and choose whichever one feels best for you, what feels most comfortable, what feels most soothing, okay. I'm gonna choose heart and belly. And we're gonna spend about a minute and a half noticing our mind wander. So you're only task right now is to put a little pressure on your body and pay attention to the feeling, the sensation created when your hands touch your own self. And then when your mind wanders which it almost certainly will, catch it say, "Oh! Wandering mind, intrusive thoughts, I'm distracted" right. Say whatever it is that you need to say and then bring your attention, actively bring your attention back to that sensation of connection between your hands and your body. When you hear the sound of the singing bowl you'll know that it's time to finish this practice. You have choices here. You can close your eyes which is what I would recommend if that option feels okay for you or you can look down or you can look at one spot that's not moving, just put a, a soft gaze, a soft focus into your eyes and stare out one thing that's not moving. Now go ahead and start whenever you're ready and at the sound of the singing bowl you'll know it's time to open your eyes or look back to the screen. 

01:10:10
[sil.] 

01:11:50
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Open your eyes or look up. And just check in with yourself. Did I notice my mind getting distracted? Did it seem like my mind wandered a lot or little? Did my mind wander, and I forgot to catch it? Just check in with your own experience umm… and remember how challenging 90 minutes, 90 seconds sorry of bringing your focus back to one point is, and maybe use it to have a little compassion for your kids who are really struggling with focus and distractibility. Alright, so we connect, we breath, we move, we practice focusing and then finally we relax, and we relax. Now the last element of our program is relax because giving our body time to rest, to reduce external stimulation and relieve physical pressure brings balance to the whole system. Our kids are tired. I work with kids from preschool right up through high school about three years old to really to into their early 20s, and I would say one of the things that is most consistent across all ages of kids is that they are all tired, and when we're tired our anxiety goes up. Alright, when we're tired that sense that we have to be vigilant, that we have to protect ourselves goes up. And our belief and our strength, our own capacity goes down. Being exhausted is not good for your kids' anxiety. So what we're gonna do today is umm… we're gonna do two simple restorative yoga poses. Actually, I'm gonna demonstrate too, and I'm gonna ask you to choose one of them to practice on your own. So one option is to come into child's pose. Now child's pose is what you see the kids in the picture in front of you doing. If you have a yoga mat or a towel handy that's great. Umm… If not you'd probably be okay on the floor as long as you're in that kind of a clean and comfortable space. So I'm gonna demonstrate child's pose right now then I'm gonna demonstrate another post called legs up the wall, and you're gonna choose. I'm gonna give you a moment to choose which posture to come into, and we're gonna spend a couple of minutes in that pose. I'm gonna play a little bit of music, and I'm gonna invite you to really take the opportunity to relax. If you're feeling the urge to like check your emails doing during these three minutes uh… I would just check in and decide if that's really umm… the best choice that you can make for your own well being right now. Okay, so child's pose, so to come in to child's pose uh… the way that I would recommend you have your kids come into a child's pose is first by sitting on their heels. So you're gonna sit on your heels and then say okay, glue your hips to your heels, and then you're simply gonna fold forward and bring your head to rest on the floor. Now it's pretty important that you support your head in child's pose. Your head is very heavy, and if it's just like hanging out in space it's gonna really impede your capacity to, to relax, to let your body relax. It's important that your head is supported. Sometimes for some people in order to get the head all the way to the floor the hips start coming up, and it looks something like this. That's also not so great, right. You want to relax here and having your hips hanging out in the air could potentially make you feel really uncomfortable, really vulnerable umm… not the best for relaxation. So what you want to do is make sure you keep your hips on your heels, and if you need to bring the floor to your head just do it. You can use a block or a couple of books or a cushion. Anything umm… to give your head a little support so when we would just come down to lay, my hair, come down to the lay so that your forehead is being supported by the object. So that's one choice you can make for this restorative practice, and the other is legs up the wall. Now I'm gonna show you an image uh… of legs on a chair, right. This is a variation. I'm gonna do legs up the right now. If you don't have a wall handy either now or when you're doing this work with your kids and teens you can always do this on a chair. Now to me the easiest way to come into this pose at the wall is to actually come into a child's pose with my toes touching the wall and then roll onto my back extending my legs up the wall. So I'll show you what that looks like right now. 

01:16:35
[sil.] 

01:16:40
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And once you get there you can scoot you a little closer, come further away. Just find a way to be comfortable. So go ahead and choose one of those practices now, and I'm gonna start a little bit of music, and I invite you to take just these three minutes to let your body rest before we finish up our umm… the rest of our seminar today. I'll be right back. 

01:17:10
[music] 

01:20:30
[sil.] 

01:20:35
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER Take a moment. Maybe wriggle your fingers and your toes. Start to wake up your body. 

01:20:50
[sil.] 

01:20:55
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER And then slowly bring yourself back up to sit. 

01:21:00
[sil.] 

01:21:15
JENNIFER COHEN HARPER So we're coming towards the end of our time together. We did practices of connection, breath work movement, focus and relax. Now all rooted in this desire to help our kids become more embodied, more aware of their own personal experience in the present moment. As you incorporate the practices we did today into your work and as you seek out additional ways to support the children in your life remember the body is a resource, right, Our bodies are resources not liabilities. Often the experience of anxiety makes us feel as if our body is somehow betraying us, might somehow even harming us, but if we can learn to pay attention to the body, uh… give it what it needs, respect what it's telling us, support it, honor it uh… then our body is often our greatest ally, right. Our body is an asset not a liability. It provides us information, gives us strength and gives us a tool to allow our courage to manifest as action, alright. We need to hear this message, our kids need to hear this message. "Your body is not a liability. Your body is a source of strength, your body is an asset, and an ally even if it doesn't always feel that way." Our culture uh… is one that is really quite dis embodying, for example, umm… we all know we often send children the message that they should not pay attention to their own body, that they shouldn't listen to their own umm… intuition, that they should ignore sensations or messages from their body, and listen to some external source instead. Now trauma is the most disembodying, umm… but a lot of our kids are disembodied just as a matter of, of our culture, you know, we say things to kids like umm… "Finish your dinner." "I'm not hungry." "Yes, you are." Or the kids say, "No, I need to go to the bathroom." And we say things like, "No, you don't. You just went." Or "Put on your coat." "I'm not cold." "You're cold." Right, all of these things, you know, they are funny, and they kind of seem innocuous, and maybe they are in the small moments, but when they add up to a dominant message of "Don't listen to your own body" externalize, listen to an external source and allow that external source of information to override the information you're getting from your own body. It becomes really problematic, and it contributes to uh… a path of disembodiment, right, it just a chronic kind of path of disembodiment. Umm… If we keep going on that path for our kids after a while the communication system between the mind and the body can break down, and we start to ignore the messages for so long that we stop being able to hear them anymore. When this happens, if this happens we've lost a really great resource, we've lost one of our primary tools for understanding the world around us and ourselves, and the protective part of our brain it doesn't appreciate this cutting off of information. Disembodiment contributes to anxiety, disembodiment contributes to anxiety as we lose touch with ourselves and as we lose touch of the present moment and what's real, what's happening around us. So repairing this mind, body, communication system, teaching children that their body is worth listening to, worth paying attention to, worth taking care of, is an important component in teaching them to manage anxiety and navigate stressful situations. Finally, don't forget that play and laughter especially in communication with others are really important parts of any child's life, and they're crucial for children struggling with anxiety, right. Our kids need reminders. It's kind of sad that they need reminders, but they do need reminders that it's okay to rest, enjoy and to engage fully with other people. So I really encourage you to seek out opportunities, whether it's in your teaching, your therapy practice, your parenting, whatever the role is that you're engaging uh… the children and teens in your life in, even if it's a very serious and important role. Maybe especially if it's a very serious and important role uh… I encourage you to invite a sense of playfulness, of joyfulness umm… into the work, right, in, invite laughter into your work with the kids umm… you can think of it in some ways as practicing laughing is the opposite of practicing anxiety, right. Bring playfulness into your work and just watch it will transform your kids, and it will transform your relationships with your kids. So that's all today, and we have some additional resources if you'd like to explore in more detail any of the ideas that I have talked about today umm… you can check out uh…. my book Little Flower Yoga For Kids which has a lot of the umm… some of the activities we did today and then a lot of back to additional activities. Umm… I also recommend The Upside of Stress by Kelly McGonagall, A Still Quiet Place by Amy Saltzman. A Still Quiet Place also comes with a wonderful CD, audio practices of mindfulness activities for children and teens. I really recommend it highly. Uh… The Whole Brainchild by Daniel Segal is a wonderful resource to better understand what's going on in your kids' brains as they develop uh… and then finally the book I mentioned earlier uh… Presence by Amy Cuddy.
