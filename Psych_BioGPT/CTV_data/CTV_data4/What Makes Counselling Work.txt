What makes counseling work? 

00:00:05
An investigation into factors that contribute 

00:00:05
to the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic 

00:00:05
treatment progress in Australia

CLIVE JONES My name is Clive and at the back is a work professor Rich E Hicks, whose name is also on the -- you can turn around and say good day, if you want. We are working together on a project. We spoke a little bit about it in an another presentation -- one component of the project in regard to stress and burnout in counsellors and that's the smaller part of a larger project that we are doing in regard to examining what makes psychotherapeutic practices work, and I use the term interchangeably, counsellor and psychotherapist and therapy -- just using those terms loosely and we don’t need to go into it by the definitions about that -- so that’s fine. Okay, now in regard to this, what is the prompt or the motivation originally for making this happen. I will -- I just got to get used to these bits and pieces here – there we go, okay. 

00:01:00
Aim of the Study 

00:01:00
The air is to clarify factors that have 

00:01:00
been shown to contribute to the 

00:01:00
effectiveness of psychotherapeutic 

00:01:00
treatment progresses applied by 

00:01:00
psychotherapists and counsellors 

00:01:00
practicing within Australia. 

00:01:00
CLIVE JONES The aim of the study that we are doing, I will just and follow the step at a time to clarify factors that have been shown to contribute to the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic treatment processes. What is that makes counselling look -- so what is actually happening within the counselling session between the client, between the therapists and the environment that they are in that actually ends up having some sort of outcome with it. Now that question is something that we can know intuitively, and it is something that we learn with experience over time. It’s things that we discover what works. Now, there is a lot of ramifications to this type of study that a lot of ramifications to the profession of counselling -- this type of study. There is -- and I just want to put this, contextualize this into a political arena for a little while, and that is that at the moment we all have a piece of the mental health pie in regard to offering help and assistance to people in need. Now, in that there are certain boundaries of professions, counsellors, psychotherapists, psychologists, social workers, occupational therapists, mental health nurses, psychiatrists, and as a consequence, there is -- there can be from a political perspective when a politician is asking -- I have got a pocketful of money here, where do I put it to ensure that people who are seeking mental health assistance are going to benefit, what is it that will help them the most -- and so, research like these and so forth is a way of trying to say, well, these are the things that work, and these are the things that can effect change in a person's emotional state or behavioral disposition or whatever is happening. But it goes -- hopefully it's able to transcend boundaries of title and that is why in a sense using the word psychotherapist or counsellor in the study, it’s really -- the term is not important, it is a practice. If two people sitting in a room together, working through some issues and then what happens? And why does it happen, and how does it happen. So, we have to in a sense as professionals and experts in the field, we need to inform politicians about them, we need to inform the community about that, we need to inform ourselves about that and each other about that, what is it that's working. What it also does, it informs training programs. When you got to learn about counselling and psychotherapeutic practice, what is that needs to be appropriate in order to train somebody up in order to work effectively and so, there is a lot of different reasons why this type of information can be handy as well as on an individual level being able to say right, okay. So these are some things that are important. So I will now try to apply that into my practice or I would try in a professional development in those areas and so forth. That's what we are looking at. Now, we don't have -- it's a study that is going to be going over 12 months and I'm going to look -- I'm going to show you some of the variables that we are looking at in regard to that, some of the client factors, some of the psychotherapist factors, and the therapeutic relationship factors that have been shown in the past to show some type of impact, positive effect, and we are looking at these things more, we want to fan into flame the data and the information in regard to those things to see. 

00:04:40
Method 

00:04:40
Utilizing surveys responses. 

00:04:40
All survey items were self-report measures used to obtain pertinent information on: 

00:04:40
1. the client, 

00:04:40
2. the counsellor, 

00:04:40
3. the therapeutic relationship and 

00:04:40
4. the overall effectiveness of treatment. 

00:04:40
CLIVE JONES Okay, so utilizing surveys -- it's surveys. We are asking questions. And a survey is just simply one way of being able to ask a lot of people at once over a wide range of locations, what you think about this, what do you feel about that, how is it for you, when, what is it like if, and so there is all these survey questions that are just one way of communicating to the clients and the psychotherapists, counsellor, what is going on in the room, what is going on in their mind, what are they feeling, how are they choosing to behave and do any of those things that have an impact. So, we have client factors, counsellor factors, the therapeutic relationship and then the overall effectiveness of treatment. The overall effectiveness of treatment is done with a pre and a post -- where there is the pre-assessment of where the client is at, and then after that therapeutic process a post-assessment of where the client is at, and whether or not there is any changes in there. That's what we are looking at and ultimately that is the bottom line of what is effective therapeutic work, what is effective work. 

00:05:55

3. Expectations of treatment success 

00:05:55
5 items on a 1-4 rating 

00:05:55
CLIVE JONES So, I’ll tease – I’ve got these things. The first we look at the client factors first. What might have an impact -- some of the things we already know, some of these things we need to know more about. Age, so just for starters, we can say okay, is there a difference between the age of a therapist and the impact of the therapy. Are people in their 20s more effective than people in their 60s? Or the other way around, are people in their 60s with lot of experience more effective than people who are teenagers working with other adolescents? Age, age is an important thing. Gender. Is there any difference between male and female – do males work better with males, do females work better with females or vice versa -- those sorts of things we can look at. Or is there no difference? And if there are differences, what might those differences be? What might be there? The state of residence. Really, it is a way of being able to get some type of demographic information of counsellors and psychotherapists across Australia. So we'd like to see where people are located. This study is wanting to compare differences to in regard to the type and level of education and so we are wanting to get a broad cross-section across -- we are looking at psychologist, counsellors, social work, occupational therapy, as I was saying before -- broad range -- and is there any difference between the type of training, and level of training. Is it at diploma level or a doctoral level? At the moment, in the United States, we are looking at a minimum level of qualification to register as a psychologist, a doctorate. And so is that what is required, what level of training is the appropriate level of training? And also the type. Each type of training has certain emphasize and focus of the things that are talked about. Number of visits to therapy. This is an important factor in terms of lead up and what we are looking at here is more in regard to what experience has the client had in therapy previously. Have they had any experience before and is this going to impact or not, or if they had positive experiences or negative experiences before and could this impact or not on therapy. And the main reasons for visiting the therapists now. So we are looking at the subjective perspective of what the client is wanting to look at, and then we’ve also got a symptom inventory that we're looking at. So we are trying to compare what the client says, they are visiting the therapist for, and also other assessments that are looking at their emotional state, to see if those things match up. Is perception of what they're going to see the client actually matching up to some other objective measures that we have seeing. So, that's the demographic information of clients that we are looking at. Now, there have been studies showing elements of these things in the past, people trying to work out -- do these things have an impact? But again, wanting to teach them how to look more. Stress precursors. What we are looking at here is – it’s strenuous stressors that a client might have faced in the last 12 months, and so not only the emotional issues, whether the stressors are something that are causing the issues that they are going to see the counselor for, or whether the stressors are something that are adding to and then so being able to work out those nuances. And so listing those stressors as well. Expectations of treatment success. There has been some research in that and that the more the client is expecting success than generally the more successful therapy could be, and so in that sense it could be the first part of goal and therapy might be to start to raise the client’s sense of hope -- hope might be an extremely powerful emotion to start to instill within the client at the very onset of connecting with the client, and so in terms of-- or might not. We may find that if this is not impacting them. So, we need to find what's relevant in order to apply accordingly, but you would expect there is a hunch, isn't there? That-that hope is going to have a quite a powerful and significant impact on outcomes of treatment. 

00:10:35
Client Factors 

00:10:35
4. Perceived levels of social support from significant others 

00:10:35
- Multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS) 

00:10:35
Family 

00:10:35
Friends 

00:10:35
Significant other 

00:10:35
5. Personality Factors 

00:10:35
The Mini International Personality Item Pool ( Mini IPIP) 

00:10:35
20 items measuring 5 factors. 

00:10:35
- Extraversion 

00:10:35
- Agreeableness 

00:10:35
- Conscientiousness 

00:10:35
- Neuroticism 

00:10:35
- Intellect 

00:10:35
CLIVE JONES So, the other client factors that we're looking at. Perceived levels of social support. Now, this is probably one of the most significant factors that has come across in research so often that the more social support the clients have then the more likely they are going to have positive outcomes -- the more social support. So, this is an important factor to look at even more -- what type of social support. The support from family members and from friends and also a significant other. Is there a significant other in the client's life that is there to support them through while they're going through therapy, and if so what impact does this have on the client's life. If findings show that that it is important, then maybe another element of working with a client is to help them connect and find a significant other to work with and possibly it is about socially networking, encouraging the client to connect with significant and social others obviously. We are looking at the personality factors of the client and we are comparing that with personality factors of the therapist as well. Are there personality clashes that might interfere with -- are there particular types of personality mixes that could work better than others. For me personally I know -- more often than not, the reason I refer a client on is because something is just not clicking, something is not quite right rather than feeling this is not an area that I feel comfortable with -- it is more-- this is not a client I feel comfortable with, and so in being able to tease up those factors a little bit more and seeing what impact that might have on outcome. If the client is getting under the skin, maybe it is important to refer on, because that might impact too much on outcome or if there are other just intricate clashes that might be going on or something that’s just not quite right and how you link in. Has anyone ever had a moment like that where there has been a client where you don't know why, but just doing a heading for some reason – yeah, you want to share a little bit about that. 

00:13:05
 (inaudible ) 

00:13:08
CLIVE JONES Sorry. 

00:13:10
 (inaudible ) 

00:13:12
CLIVE JONES You just refer very quickly? Yeah okay, yeah. So it would be good to find out a little bit more about what that might be, what factors that might be at work in them. This personality factor -- it's a Mini 20 odd in factor and it is breaking up into five key areas with extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and intellect in terms of abstract concrete picking those types of things. 

00:13:45
Client Factors 

00:13:45
6. Mindfulness & Emotional Regulation 

00:13:45
- Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale Revised ( CAMS-R ) 

00:13:45
- 4 come for names of mindfulness. 

00:13:45
- Attention 

00:13:45
Awareness 

00:13:45
Percent focus 

00:13:45
Acceptance 

00:13:45
7. Attachment style 

00:13:45
- Relationship Questionnaire & Relationship Scale Questionnaire 

00:13:45
- Adapted to relate to the attachment style of approach towards the 

00:13:45
counsellor 

00:13:45
Secure 

00:13:45
Anxious - ambivalent 

00:13:45
Avoidant 

00:13:45
Disorganized 

00:13:45
CLIVE JONES We are looking at mindfulness and emotional regulation. Is the client coming already skilled with a level of capacity and mindfulness and emotional regulation? And, always that’s something that really needs to be worked on as a first part of goal when the client comes in. Does mindfulness have a powerful impact? Now mindfulness is claimed in many ways as a new school of thought in its own right, but you could see here that this research is looking at mindfulness as an attribute of a person and a skill that a person has across any type of therapeutic practice or discipline here, so for the client to being mindful. And emotional regulation. So we are looking at four components of attention and awareness and present focus and acceptance – four key elements of mindfulness that these -- there are other elements, but these are four that were zeroing in. Attachment style. We -- looking at attachment style of therapist and the client. Secure, anxious – ambivalent, avoided, disorganized. And again are there particular types of attachment styles, not just that the client brings in, but potentially the interconnectedness of attachment styles between client and therapists and how that might work. 

00:15:25
8. Emotional Regulation 

00:15:25
Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS) 

00:15:25
It involves looking at 

00:15:25
a) awareness and understanding of emotions. 

00:15:25
b) acceptance of emotions. 

00:15:25
c) ability to control impulsive behaviors and behave in accordance 

00:15:25
with desired goals when experiencing negative emotions. 

00:15:25
d) ability to use situationally appropriate emotion regulation strategies, 

00:15:25
flexibility to modulate emotional responses as desired in order to 

00:15:25
most individual goals and situational demands 

00:15:25
6 subcategories 

00:15:25
-Non-acceptance of emotional responses 

00:15:25
-Difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior 

00:15:25
-Impulse control difficulties 

00:15:25
-Lack of emotional awareness 

00:15:25
-Limited access to emotion regulation strategies 

00:15:25
-Lack of emotional clarity 

00:15:25
CLIVE JONES And we are zeroing in lot more on emotional regulation, while we looked at that in the context of mindfulness, we are also looking at emotional regulation in more detail. And you can see here that it is quite extensive, lot of stuff we are looking at in regard to the client's capacity in emotional regulation. The awareness and understanding of emotions, acceptance of emotions, ability to control impulse and ability to use situational emotions appropriately - and six cut subcategories -- you can see there. A non-acceptance of emotional responses, difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior. Some clients will prevent -- present really advertly with poor emotional regulation skills, and when its stands out it’s something that you sort of automatically go to working on straight away. But there might be subtle nuances as well, something they might not necessarily stand out as strongly, just from -- in trauma cases and so forth emotional regulation can be something that stands out as an issue that needs to be worked on straight away. But again, we are looking at the nuances and the subtleties and not so much the extremes as well. 

00:16:50
9. Curiosity & Exploration 

00:16:50
-Curiosity & Exploration Inventory 

00:16:50
- assesses individual differences in the recognition pursuit, and 

00:16:50
integration of novel and challenging experiences and information. 

00:16:50
7. Item scale with two factors 

00:16:50
Factor One : Exploration refers to a desire and striving for novel and challenging information and experiences 

00:16:50
Factor Two: Absorption refers to propensity to be deeply engaged in activities. 

00:16:50
CLIVE JONES And curiosity and exploration. This is something that has come up a little bit in some search and that the curiosity of the client and a disposition to want to explore. So, you can see the two main factors here, where there is a desire to explore and a striving for novel and challenging information and experiences and that's really the therapeutic process, isn't it, where the client is having to explore alternative ways of living and coping with issues in life. So is that at a disposition that they come with? We might sort of presume that, here we go, you are here -- booked in and this is something and a tribute or quality that you have. But it would not be something -- another thing that we might need to work with the client to develop rather than being something that’s already there. 

00:17:50
Therapists Factors 

00:17:50
1. Demographic Information. 

00:17:50
Age 

00:17:50
Gender 

00:17:50

00:17:50
Professional Development topics covered over past 12 months 

00:17:50
Additional topics and training needs for PD 

00:17:50
What works for you in PD 

00:17:50
Have you ever referred a client 

00:17:50
Reasons for referring clients 

00:17:50
Who are clients referred to 

00:17:50
What do you do that makes a difference in therapy 

00:17:50
CLIVE JONES Now, we’ll get to the therapist. What do we bring, what's the stuff that we have that might be of benefit -- what not just in a bag of tricks, but in our character and personality and everything that we are. What might we bring and so, we've got quite a chunk of demographic data here that we're looking at. To break down different things, the age, the gender, state of residence, type and level of education, number of full-time equivalent years in practice. That will be an interesting thing to look at, comparing years in practice against the type and level of training -- is 20 years in practice actually having a greater impact or shows some difference compared to somebody that might have a doctoral training. Is 20 years of practice with a diploma actually outweigh in terms of outcome to years of practice with a doctoral degree or the other way around, and these are certain things to be able to look at as well. You can see that these -- this is good information for government to have too isn't it in terms of saying that will weigh the cutoffs in terms of registrations and legislations and giving money out, those types of things. So, type and level of education, number of full-time years experience, number and types of approaches applied. And so, in terms of being able to operationalize that variable of the treatment. What's actually being done it -- there is always the factor of the therapist. We put our own flavor and stamp on whatever we do, and so it is very difficult to cookie cut when researching an exact model of approach in how a therapist works. Hence, I write, this is CBT, and we know that it's been done faithfully across every therapist that’s working in the study. But what is important is, is getting an understanding of the therapist's level of training, type of training, and then what they are saying that they are applying in practice, what type of strategies are they using to get an effect, and this would be great information to work out, you know, how much, how much is CBT? How much is (inaudible ), how much is narrative, how much is solution focus, what cross-section of approaches are being applied in getting an effect. Professional development. This is an important factor too, how important is that? Those that have more professional development showing that there are better outcomes or not. Is -- are we seeing any differences in the type and the amount of professional development. We have additional topics and training needs, that's another thing just in terms of what a counsellor is looking for, for professional development? What works and what doesn't work in professional developments, so it’s another information there. Referring a client, and reasons for referring a client, who are clients referred to, so a lot of other information that we've got coming up there. 

00:21:15
Therapists Factors 

00:21:15
1. Demographic information (Continued) 

00:21:15

00:21:15
2. Occupational Stress Inventory 

00:21:15
-Three Factors 

00:21:15
-Occupational Role 

00:21:15
- Personal Strain 

00:21:15
- Personal Resources 

00:21:15
CLIVE JONES Demographic Information keeping going here, rating current level of experience. So the perception of the therapists’ perspective of their own experience. Do they feel that their at the novice level or competent level, proficient or expert. And so that's the, the therapists’ perspective on that. Factors that tell you that you have made a difference. So what -- why we are getting objectives data analysis in terms of a questionnaire of symptoms , and pre- and post-assessment. What, does the therapist say as change, what do they consider is time for things to finish, the job is being done and time for the client to move on. What do we say, and then match that up with the pre- and post-assessments as well. You can see here, level of satisfaction of the therapist, reasons for choosing to join the profession, looking at key reasons why clients present, supports available in regard to -- we're looking at supervision and those types of things and the role that plays. Occupational Stress. Now we're looking at stress in the impact of that if we would -- Dick and I were talking about that, Dick was talking about that in a previous presentation and the level of stress we bring in as a therapist -- does that impact on the outcomes, and if so, then that’s important in terms of the environment, and how we look after ourselves as therapists, if we find you know that there is a big impact on stress role, maybe not, maybe we can go in after having a heavy night and on the booze and crawling and sit down and -- you know, sort of just drag ourselves through it and it might not have any impact, might have a positive impact, and so it’s a reason for us all to get on the booze a bit more. So to be able to see the stress levels, occupational role, the stressors of that, and the environment in which counsellors and therapists work, are they conducive to positive environment, so is it causing stress. Personal strain and personal resources, the abilities of -- that are able to be put into place or the factors can be put into place to cope. 

00:23:30
Therapists Factors 

00:23:30

00:23:30
(c) devolving client, 

00:23:30

00:23:30
Factor One: Exploration refers to a desire and striving for novel and challenging information and experiences. 

00:23:30
Factor Two: Absorption refers to the propensity to be deeply engaged in activities. 

00:23:30
CLIVE JONES All right, counsellor burnout that's looking more the same, looking at curiosity and exploration in the therapist as well. Same, and mindfulness and emotional regulation in the same way the clients as well. 

00:23:55
5. Mindfulness & Emotional Regulation (Clients do this too) 

00:23:55
- Cognitive & Affective Mindfulness Scale Revised ( CAMS-R) 

00:23:55

6. Therapist Empathy 

00:23:55
The Interpersonal Reactivity Index used to measure dispositional 

00:23:55
empathy 

00:23:55
IT has 4 seven-item subscales. 

00:23:55
Perspective taking (PT) tendency to spontaneously adopt the 

00:23:55
psychological point of view of others in everyday life (“I sometimes 

00:23:55
try to understand my friends better by imagining how things look 

00:23:55
from their perspective”). 

00:23:55
Empathic concern (EC) tendency to experience feelings of sympathy 

00:23:55
and compassion for unfortunate others (“I often have tender, 

00:23:55
concerned feelings for people less fortunate than me”). 

00:23:55
Personal distress (PD) tendency to experience distress and 

00:23:55
discomfort in response to extreme distress in others (“Being in a 

00:23:55
tense emotional situation scares me”). 

00:23:55
Fantasy (FS) tendency to imaginatively transpose oneself into 

00:23:55
fictional situations (“When I am reading an interesting story or novel, 

00:23:55
I imagine how I would feel if the events in the story were happening 

00:23:55
to me”). 

00:23:55
CLIVE JONES Therapist empathy, want to check that out as well. I think that's one way of really driving home points of Rogers, you know, and the impact of empathy on therapeutic outcomes. So being able to just get a good look at that. And what this particular questionnaire looks at -- four components of empathy, perspective taking, empathic concern, personal distress, in terms of how the stress one feels when listening to the story of someone else, and the tendency to be able to imagine to put oneself in the other person’s shoes -- that's the fantasy one. 

00:24:45

00:24:45
the outcome of a treatment program based on reducing symptom 

00:24:45
severity.

CLIVE JONES And that's the symptoms that we're looking at pre- and post with clients. We are looking at depression-anxiety, a whole range of different things in the categories there. So that would be pre-and post and we wanted to see if there is any shift. Basically, that's been used because for most studies around the world, a brief symptom Inventory is something that used a lot as a pre-and post-assessment, so we'll be able to match it up with other studies just as a comparison. And client satisfaction survey as an effective dose of treatment. How satisfied was the client of the treatment, so that's the part of it as well.

Therapeutic Alliance 

00:25:30
The Helping Alliance evaluated post treatment 

00:25:30
The Helping-Alliance Questionnaire for Client & Therapist versions 

00:25:30
Offers a quick and global impression of 

00:25:30
the clients’ perception of the quality of the working alliance with the 

00:25:30
therapist and 

00:25:30
the therapists’ perception of the quality of the working alliance with 

00:25:30
the client 

00:25:30
Factors include 

00:25:30
the collaborative effort of client and therapist for example, “The 

00:25:30
therapist, client and I have meaningful exchanges.” 

00:25:30
the client’s perception of the therapist for example, “At times I 

00:25:30
distrust the therapist’s judgment.” 

00:25:30
Client motivation: “I want very much to work out my problems” 

00:25:30
Client perception of the therapist’s feeling about them. “I believe 

00:25:30
that the therapist like me as a person.” 

00:25:30
Negatively worded items include for example, “The procedures 

00:25:30
used in my therapy are not well suited to my needs.” 

00:25:30
CLIVE JONES And finally, we're looking at the therapeutic alliance and factors in that. In the therapeutic alliance, we're looking at -- this questionnaire looks at -- you can see there that the factors listed there, we're looking at attachment styles which is also a way of looking at the therapeutic alliance as well, but this talks very specifically on how the therapist felt, in the relationship with the client, and how the client felt in the relationship with the therapist, and it looks like a whole range of variables in regard to that. So this is a study that’s going to be unfolding over the next 12 months, and some of you might have actually even signed up for it. As any one actually signed up for it? I guess some of you have. And for those of you that have, I appreciate that if any of you do want to sign up for this study it’s quite important that we continue to build the data in the sample size over the next 12 months, and you can either email myself or Dick, you can contact us through ICI, you can get in touch with Philip and he can get you in touch with us if you are wanting to participate. Anyway that's all from me.
