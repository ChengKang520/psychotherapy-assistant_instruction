RICH SIMON Welcome everyone. I'm Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker. Welcome to this webcast series. The six biggest challenges therapists face. And today, uh, as part of the series, we're gonna be looking at the question of treating the narcissistic client. We have, fortunate to have someone who's made treating that particular kind of case, that particular kind of individual, a clinical specialty. So let's welcome to this webcast Wendy Behary. Hi Wendy. How are ya? 

00:00:45
WENDY BEHARY Hey Rich. I'm great. Thanks. How are you? 

00:00:45
RICH SIMON So this would, treating the narcissistic client wouldn't be high on many therapists lists. How did you first get interested in, in doing this kind of work? 

00:01:00
WENDY BEHARY Uh. Well. As I, I mentioned this in my books and it's, it's the truth. I was an intern and I was working in a mediation program at the time and I was met with one of these types. And he was, you know, probably on the spectrum, the more extreme form. Very arrogant, very intimidating, very self-aggrandizing. I was thrown, you know. And I was thrown by even being thrown. . . 

00:01:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:01:25
WENDY BEHARY . . . because it's not typically my style to be so, um, put off or retiring or shy or intimidated. And just kept noticing through the years that as I would, uh, encounter this type of client, that I'd find myself saying things that I didn't mean. Yes. No. When I meant to say yes I'd say no, or I'd apologize for things that I shouldn't have been apologizing for. I'd be questioning my career choices. It was just mind boggling to me, thinking, I'm getting triggered, you know . . . 

00:01:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:01:55
WENDY BEHARY This is really triggering and wanting to understand it, curious, a little competitive I guess, you know. 

00:02:00
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:02:00
 At the challenge of taking this on and, and dug a little deeper into myself and into this particular client profile. And . . . 

00:02:10
RICH SIMON So let's talk about that. Let's, before we, and we're gonna be talking about it in a very practical way about what you, model you developed and, and methods you've used, and , and basically an orientation you've developed in working with, uh, narcissistic clients. What is narcissism? What, what is the, there's a DSM definition of narcissism. 

00:02:35
WENDY BEHARY Mm-hmm. 

00:02:40
RICH SIMON Like I think you have a , a somewhat, uh, you, you have a, you're own way of defining that what a narcissistic client it is. Let's begin by talking a bit about that. The, the more formal DSM definition and what you're own evolving, the definition you've evolved for, for this sort of person. 

00:02:55
WENDY BEHARY (crosstalk) Yeah. (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm, I'm, um, I think as,a s diagnostic labels go, the majority of them, especially of DSM, carry a lot of pejorative(ph) weight for many people. But they're, you know, for, for clinicians there's a, a use in understanding of profile because it provides us with some, um, implications for treatment. And the DSM diagnosis for narcissism, it's not, you know, it's fai-, it's fairly comprehensive when you're thinking about, a, a really more extreme, overt or in popular, some of the popular literature, malignant type of narcissist. Meaning that, on all, all of the traits, the self-aggrandizing, the abstraction(ph), the sometimes self-destructive, self-stimulating behaviors, the level of self absorption, aggression, are quite extreme, quite frequent, um, intense when activated. And in some ways it becomes a default state for them, because it's so embedded in their personality. In my book I, I have a page in the book where I talk about the 13 signs that I ask the general reader to look at in order to determine whether or not they're dealing with a, someone who's on the spectrum. Cuz I think of narcissism as on the spectrum. And along that spectrum, these traits like being highly self-absorbed. Um. Controlling, dominating, demanding, um, self-righteous, opinionated, um, seemingly unable to express empathy or be in the internal world of another, and we can talk more about that maybe in a little bit. 

00:04:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:04:45
WENDY BEHARY But anyway. And the list goes on. And so it's really just a kind of observational measure of, um, you know, where your narcissist might be at. Because again, some people have narcissistic features. They don't have a full-blown, DSM narcissistic personality disorder. 

00:05:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:05:00
WENDY BEHARY You know, in accordance with the manual. 

00:05:00
RICH SIMON So let's, in terms of the, the normal range of human personality, um, um. all of us get self-absorbed from time to time. 

00:05:15
WENDY BEHARY Mm-hmm. 

00:05:15
RICH SIMON We have our egos, we have our occasional moments of grandiosity. Um, what's, where, where do we begin to talk about something that's a distinct kind of clinical type here? Where, where do we begin to cross these lines? When somebody comes into your office and they haven't labeled themselves narcissistic, when, when do your antenna begin to pick up, oh here we go? This is, this is this particular kind of client and this is the kind of, these are some of the issues that we're gonna have to deal with in therapy. 

00:05:50
WENDY BEHARY Mm. Yeah. And they don't, you're right, they don't typically walk into my office saying, hi I'm a narcissist. Of course, they might Google me and see that, you know, my name is attached to narcissism all over the internet, and so they may come in cynically and say, well I guess I'm a narcissist, that's why my wife sent me here. 

00:06:05
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) (inaudible). (crosstalk) You're, you're, you're the nar-, you're Buffy the narcissist killer. 

00:06:10
WENDY BEHARY Yeah. That's exactly. Um, I think were it become distinctly different from our once in a while, our every now and then moments where we get caught up in ourselves, where our ego become all too important, where our vanity becomes an issue in our lives. You know, I make the joke and say, well that's my healthy narcissism coming out. But I do think there are levels of healthy narcissism, which means what? Healthy attention to the self, where sometimes the scale is a little lopsided and we're speeding more time paying attention to what we need, what, how we feel, how we look, how we're performing in the world, and, I don't know, I see that sometimes that, that's healthy as long as it's in balance with continuing to, you know, the give/get ratio isn't off, so to speak. 

00:06:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:07:00
WENDY BEHARY When you're talking about a true profile of narcissism in clinical terms, or maladaptive terms, the ratio's off. You know, reciprocity's missing. There isn't that give and take. There's a, there's an overwhelming, you know, weight is being placed on all about me. 

00:07:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:07:15
WENDY BEHARY And so the, the degree of self-absorption is, is greater. And even though it may no be all the time, you know, because narcissists can go into these modes where they're more shut down and they're solitary and they're, they're sort of, uh, withdrawn from the scene, distracting themselves. They're not in the spirit of giving either. So whether they're self-absorbed or their distracted, they're not giving. And so the balance is shifted tremendously. 

00:07:40
RICH SIMON Okay. So this, the, when we think of, if there is such a thing, the typical therapy client, they're, they enjoy coming in to see their therapy, this image we have of the worried well(ph). They, they, um, they're motivated to come in and to share whatev-, they're intimate life. They're looking, they're inviting the therapist in. They want some advice on how to deal with things, even when they move into tricky areas. So the, the reason that we're including narcissism as one of these challenges is they don't fit the profile of people who typically benefit from psychotherapy. What makes the difference here? These, these are not people, for the most part, who voluntarily come in to psychotherapy, are they? 

00:08:35
WENDY BEHARY That's, that's absolutely correct. Uh. They don't. The only exception to that is, in the cases where they may have been warned or threatened or advised for a long, long time and have always said, forget it. I'm not going to therapy. That's for crazy people. 

00:08:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:08:50
WENDY BEHARY That's for weak people. And then they find themselves, later in they're lives, alone and depressed, anxious, or perhaps debilitated by a medical condition, where they actually need someone and they can't deal with that needy sensation. And so, they may find, they may enter into therapy at that point, because the depression becomes overwhelming to them. But even the, it's, its a, it's a scarce population. And it's not necessarily one where there's success in treatment, because some of those behaviors will emerge, ultimately, with the therapist. 

00:09:25
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:09:25
WENDY BEHARY The therapist seen as a , in a hierarchical position. Um, they come in to therapy many, most times involuntarily. They're coming because they've been told that this is they're last chance or the marriage is over. Go to therapy or, you know, you're, you're gonna lose your job. Go to therapy or you don't get your drivers license back after your third, you know, DUI. 

00:09:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:09:50
WENDY BEHARY Um, so there are consequences. Therapy becomes a consequence and the consequence, the deeper consequence is what happens if you don't go to therapy, you're going to lose something that's meaningful. And if that isn't happening, you know, if it's an idol threat, or there's no real consequence, treatment almost always fails. I would say, close to 100% of the time, treatment will fail if there's no leverage and if the therapist isn't skillful enough, enough at keeping the leverage high, you know, maintaining reminders of those consequences that, the, the, client faces if they don't continue to work at improving these behaviors and figuring out what drives them. 

00:10:30
RICH SIMON Okay. So give us a flavor here. Let's, if, if, what is, if, if I was in your office and I was able to, um, see you work with, uh, a, a client who's more intrinsically motivated and a narcissistic client who's coming to you in the way you've just described, what's the, is it, would I see a big difference in your behavior, how you might conduct a first interview with one sort of clients as opposed to the other? 

00:11:00
WENDY BEHARY Yeah that's a great question because it is different and it's a good thing to point out. With an, if you were watching me with a first interview with narcissistic client or even a first, second, third, it's, it's an ongoing part of the work but you'd see almost immediately that my focus would be on the way, in this case, I'll say he because I work mostly with narcissistic men, the focus would be on the way he is relating with me. How it feels between us-the relationship. Because I'm immediately going to start by defining the treatment room as a kind of laboratory or a microcosm of the greater world outside. We immediately make it relevant to what happens in his life outside the treatment room. 

00:11:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:11:45
WENDY BEHARY So even if he begins by blaming, you know, he says I'm here because, you know, I shouldn't be here, my wife is crazy. I'm here you appease her. She's the one who should be sitting here because she's, she's unreasonable and because she's hysterical and she has all these emotions and, but okay. To shut her up I'm here because I can't deal with all this. I have important things that I have to take care of in my life and he's on, and on, and he's pointing the finger.And I might say, you know, it's interesting, as I listen to you, we'll call him Joe, as I listen to you Joe, I get the sense of what it might feel like to be your partner in a relationship. You know, where in all of what you just said, I didn't for one minute here any part that you feel is your contribution to the conflict, and, and we know, we know, right, that universally speaking, that to have a conflict in a relationship, it usually takes two parts. 

00:12:40
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:12:40
WENDY BEHARY I'm not hearing anything about your part. So I wonder, I'm not saying you're wrong Joe, but I'm saying then I wonder, to what degree, this is part of the frustration for your wife, that there's no, no part belongs to you? You have no responsibility in the conflict. So you'd immediately see me pointing out how it feels. I will take on the role of the boss, or the wife, or the adult child who's not speaking to the parent anymore, or the sibling, of the friend, or whoever it might be that's raised the bar and finally confronted them and finally said, that's it, get some help, or get out fo my life. 

00:13:15
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Huh. 

00:13:15
WENDY BEHARY Um. I, I will take them on if they're doing it with me, you know. Well you therapists, oh and all your psycho babble and all this jargon. You know. And I might immediately say, you know I know it's not your intention to want to, um, maybe be, be hurtful to me, per se, but it is pretty off putting. 

00:13:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:13:35
WENDY BEHARY Is this the way you talk to most people who you just met for the first or second time, about their profession? 

00:13:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:13:40
WENDY BEHARY So your almost immediately talking about what it feels like to be in a relationship with them. 

00:13:50
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:13:50
WENDY BEHARY You know. 

00:13:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:13:50
WENDY BEHARY And so that's what you would notice. You would notice that there's, I'm not theorizing. 

00:13:55
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:13:55
WENDY BEHARY I'm not being theoretical. I'm not even asking too many questions just yet. I might star-, I might follow that with a question like, um, how long have you been doing that when you feel uncomfortable or when you feel upset or when you feel like you have to do something you don't wanna do? How long have you been responding this way? Or ho-, where did you get that message? You know. So it's, I want to understand it, but you'd notice immediately that it's about the moments that are occurring right there between us in the room. 

00:14:30
RICH SIMON So it is, I think, for many therapists, the, the task that's central to them in the first session is joining, building the alliance, making the client feel at home, and what you're describing with with narcissistic client is fairly early on in the session, maybe give, give us a, a sense of how that would, would fit and how you might, how you might handle a initially interview. You are being quite, you're reacting a way that's really challenging, the way this person's operating in the world. That's, I, I, I think would probably be different than, um, most people would do with, what more garden variety sort of therapeutic-. 

00:15:10
WENDY BEHARY Yes. Yeah. 

00:15:10
RICH SIMON So where's, what is it, what role does the joining with the client play in, and if you're going to compare these, the kind of the, the someone who is, uh, less, a less challenging sort of case with a narcissistic client, what, what's the difference between this sort of joining alliance, building phase, of psychotherapy with the narcissism? 

00:15:30
WENDY BEHARY Yeah. That's a good, that's a great question too. The joining actually happens right there in that intervention because, um, the therapy relationship is one of the most important strategies in working with a narcissist. And the reason is because we, we meaning those of us who work and schema therapists, that's my model, um, with narcissism, we understand that the narcissist has a very strong, what we call, emotional deprivation schema, meaning that they often carry this feeling, this, this trait within their personality, this belief somewhere deep in the heart of themselves that no one will really understand them, that people won't meet their needs, that they, they can't rely on others for emotional support or, or empathy themselves. And they also carry a high degree of suspicion and mistrust. So by being real, you know, by starting a therapy session by being a human, by being real, by calling it as I see it, by asking questions, but with empathy, you know, you give 'em some benefit of the doubt. 

00:16:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:16:35
WENDY BEHARY I try to let him off the hook a little bit in terms of his intention isn't malicious. 

00:16:40
RICH SIMON Intentionality, sure. 

00:16:40
WENDY BEHARY But I'm still holding him accountable, but I'm real. And most people in the life of the narcissist are not that real. They're either really angry with them and so they're attacking them once they can't take it anymore, or they're just really putting up with them or just deferring to them or yessing them to, to death if there's something in it(ph). They expect people to use them and to manipulate them and so, very early on, that, that honest, real, human approach is, uh, startling to, for them. But it's a way of beginning to build the bond, because I'm not playing games. 

00:17:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:17:15
WENDY BEHARY I'm not speaking in, you know, in language that is, uh, theoretical or irrelevant to what's happening right there in that moment with them. So, and you wanna grab that fast because that's how you grab the leverage. In fact sometimes it just sets the stage for them to get into a nice competitive game with you. But, you know it's okay. Well I'm trying to ramp up motivation, uh, for them to be there. I'm, it's alright if they, they find that challenging. 

00:17:45
RICH SIMON So say more about that. Uh, you, you had done a, a piece for that magazine a few years ago, where you really capture the flavor of this first kind of session, that kind of competitive game. So what is, let's, if you, if you could describe a little bit of that, that flavor, maybe with, with Joe or with somebody else, what is it, what is it like that first session? It's, uh, you, you're, you seem to be quite at home in that kind of an exchange with the client. Uh, most therapists I don't think are, um, unless they specialize in this kind of work, are not as, certainly not as at home as you, as you are. So give us a flavor for what that kind of competitive game might be like in a typical first session for you. 

00:18:25
WENDY BEHARY Well, you know, for most therapists it is very trying, and I think it's only because most therapists, and many who are extremely talented, and could do exactly what I'm doing, but would need to kind of clear the path first, meaning we've got to get out of our own way. We've gotta figure out what's distracting us, am I, am I feeling, am I taking it too personally? Am I too put off or jealous or feeling inferior to the accomplishments of this narcissist in front of me? Am I frightened by, am I questioning myself, and feeling inadequate(ph) in my career and my industry. And so if you're distracted by this because you have schemas, your own themes, life stories, that are getting triggered, that has to be cleared and reconciled first before we can be very present in a relationship with them. And the next piece is, I have to be able to see that, beneath this facade of this competitive, um, smarty pants in front of me, there's, there's a little boy underneath who's just kinda fighting for his own survival and trying to prove himself and feels trapped and feels silly and weak, sitting there with me. So if I can remember that as I'm there in the treatment room with him, I can, you know, I can hold on to my empathy and even, even compassion at some of the most, you know, compelling moments to be upset. And so the competition, you know, we've, I bring attention to it immediately. I might say, um, for example, let's say Joe says, you know I have a really, I have a really busy career. I mean, you probably don't understand that Wendy, you know, because, you know, you're in this, you know, you're in this industry where you make your own hours and you come and go as you please and, you know, but I, I have, I have a very, I may have to supervise 400 people, and I'm traveling all the time, and I'm really, you know, I, I mean in my world, it's dimensions beyond anything you could comprehend. And, uh, yeah I'm lucky, I mean if you look out your window over there you'll see the amazing, I got a beautiful Maserati out there if you wanna take a peek at it, and I drove it over today cuz the weather's gorgeous. See, see he's already, he's on a tangent. 

00:20:40
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:20:40
WENDY BEHARY And what does the tangent include? I can't get him. There's no way I could get him in my little low-life world. And I, I should be impressed with him because there's a fancy car sitting out front that I can look at if I want to. And that, you know, and he's a busy guy and there's, there's no way, no matter how smart I might think I am, that I'm going to understand his very complicated, important world. And all too often, therapists will find themselves either, um, getting defensive, you know, well, you know, no, I know what it's like to have a busy life too. I have a busy practice and I work, you know, really, I know what it's like to have a hard life. So they'll, they'll, the therapist will sometimes feel drawn into the competition. And I, I have found myself, I often tell this story when I'm giving lectures, even at your, at the network's symposium, is was telling this to the group, that, you know, I had a client who was unforgettable. He came into session. It was not too long into our treatment, and he was still clearly on the path to prove to me that I didn't know anything about anything. And so he came in telling me about this exonic, uh, esoteric Russian literature that he was reading. And he made a quote, he recited a quote, and looked at me as if I should know this. And I said, I don't know. And he said, you don't know? You know, like what an idiot. And I didn't know. And I found myself, that night I went home and I was, what was I doing? Well I was, I opened up my, um, volume of Shakespeare, Hamlet, and started going over the soliloquy of Hamlet, which I used to be able to recite. 

00:22:20
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:22:20
WENDY BEHARY You know, just, just remembered it as a kid. 

00:22:25
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:22:25
WENDY BEHARY And I thought, I'm gonna go in there and show him, and start reciting to be or not to be. And I thought, what the hell am I doing? You know I'm, I'm do-, I'm getting, I'm in the games. And I told him, I went in and I actually told him. I said this is what happens. I think this is what happens, perhaps, with some of the relationships in your life. And even I, even I who understand your makeup, got caught up in it because I'm human. I got caught up in it, and got caught up in it maybe because, as a human with sensitivities, I felt put down, or I felt like I had to prove myself, or I felt like I wasn't measuring up. So, you know, exposing some of that as well, being very honest and very real about that, I'm bringing in, from myself and my own experience, information that's really critical to his healing, his own relationships with others, because we know this is what others experience and can't put it into comprehensive language for them, because others aren't trained to understand this composite client as we can. You know, as we can. That's our expertise. 

00:23:30
RICH SIMON So that's the dance. So that's, that's a, a, you know, it's a variation on the clinical dance, but it's certainly amps it up, being transparent, reacting quite personally on the one hand to what the client is presenting, and then being able to stand back from that and saying, wait a minute, this isn't about me. 

00:23:50
WENDY BEHARY (crosstalk) Yeah/ (crosstalk) Right. 

00:23:50
RICH SIMON This is about us, us, this is about this person's way of relating to the world and being able to, and, and, and being able to do that consistently, that's, that's, that's a nice balancing act. 

00:24:05
WENDY BEHARY (crosstalk) Exactly. Yeah and it requires being very present, you know, a lot of the time when you're sitting with this client, really paying attention, you know, to sometimes these seemingly little subtle nuances that would be just so delightful to avoid and ignore, and yet they're opportunities for immense amounts of change and, and growth for the client if we just let them pass by. 

00:24:25
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:24:30
WENDY BEHARY Being able to even stop it for a moment and say something like, you know, ouch, ow. What was that? 

00:24:35
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Cuz you're getting poked. So literally, you're getting, you're being... 

00:24:35
WENDY BEHARY (crosstalk) Yeah, you're getting poked or it's painful or he says something about women and I, you know, hello, you're sitting in front of a woman here. And he says, oh you're just so sensitive Wendy. 

00:24:45
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:24:45
WENDY BEHARY And I say well maybe, maybe, maybe that's true. I don't know if that's true. Maybe I'm a little sensitive, but then I would have to wonder why you wouldn't be more careful if you think that's true. 

00:24:55
RICH SIMON Oh, lovely. 

00:25:00
WENDY BEHARY You know so, it's, there's, and this isn't just about clever lines, it's really thinking about, what do I want him to learn about himself with shaming him? 

00:25:10
RICH SIMON Here(ph)? 

00:25:10
WENDY BEHARY How do I tell him, how do I do what I think is the hardest thing for people to do in relationships with people you care about, and I do happen to care about the ones that are working on themselves here with me, how do I tell him the ways in which he hurts others without hurting him? Without hurting him, without making him feel defectiveness, without making him feel blamed, but still making him feel responsible? 

00:25:35
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:25:35
WENDY BEHARY That's the challenge always here. 

00:25:40
RICH SIMON So let's, staying quite concrete here. So in a first interview with, uh, this sort of a client, there's a high level of, uh, there's nothing wrote in this. You're on your game, uh, it's, it's, meaningful interactions are happening from the get-go. What's your ai-, what your whole, was is it you're, what is you're, what is your goal or goals in a, in a first session with a narcissistic client over and above what might be a, a goal first session with any other kind of client? 

00:26:15
WENDY BEHARY The similarity with some clients, um, is that I want their guard to come down so I can meet and get acquainted to they're vulnerable side, the vulnerable part of them. And that's true with many of our clients who come in in avoidance states. With narcissists it's really like pounding through impenetrable, you know, concrete, because, and yet, and yet with the right approach it can soon feel like it's just a scratch below the skin surface and you can get to that vulnerable little child underneath who's, who's hurting. That, that scared part, that fragile part, that's actually hurting, that's afraid to need someone, that's afraid to take in the caring, that's afraid to allow themselves to be understood in a way that's more real, personal. So I wanna get below the surface, that my first goal is to try to break through the wall and try to get to that vulnerable part of them. And, um, and there's a series a different ways of doing that, but the reason the therapy relationship is so critical with this type of client, you know, using the present moments, using the relationship to get through to that vulnerability, is because you break through barriers like trust. You become real. They trust you. You can, you can hold them accountable without creating, you know, high levels of, of blame, shame, and, and a sense of defectiveness. There's, there's more safety so there's that alliance. The guard starts to come down. I use a lot of the strategies I learned in interpersonal neurobiology with Dan Siegel. I've learned a lot about, you know, how to just teach a little bit about, you know, memory activation so that this isn't about some hodge podge psychobabble. This is really the brain at work and how memory gets activated, and when you're feeling uncomfortable or threatened you go into these states of mind, et cetera, et cetera. And so, it, it begins to mitigate that, that deep feeling of shame which leads to avoidance. We want to get the avoidance out of the way so I've got to get the shame factor out of the way while still holding him accountable for his actions and the impact on others. So that's really, concretely, therapy relationship, you know, being very honest, head to head, in the treatment room, um, and, and suggesting very early on that there's another side behind this mode, behind, you know, explaining the idea modes and states of mind, that there's different parts of all of us, um, and that we're all governed by our memory. And so there's this universality that also eases some of that, um, feeling of being the bad guy. Narcissists desperately want to be the hero, they don't wanna be the bad guy. 

00:29:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:29:10
WENDY BEHARY And they immediately feel like the bad guy when they're sitting there in your office, which is why they go into these self-righteous modes. 

00:29:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. Okay. So is there, is there, in, in, in terms of just purely at the level of information, what is it, so you're, what we're been talking about is a, a kind of relationship, uh, that you're, uh, you're trying to establish. And you, you want this, uh, imposing person have a sense that this is going to be a different sort relationship then they're used to, and they're gonna hear what it's like to be on the other side of a relationship with them and in a way perhaps they haven't heard from other people in there lives. 

00:29:45
WENDY BEHARY Yes. 

00:29:45
RICH SIMON And I want to get back to that. Just, but it, in terms of just the information that you need in order to get going with people, is there, is there some information that is, is that a critically important to mention on that first interview for you and if so, is there any particular kind of information that you go for? 

00:30:05
WENDY BEHARY Yeah. I, a combination is sort of watching and interacting and observing how it feels and what I see in their style. Some of it's so predictable, in other words, that, that heavily self-absorbed, blaming others type of, um, presentation. But not always. I mean, you also get the martyr types in there, who are, who are the virtuous victims of, you know, the tough life and the a tough world that they live in. Um. You know, bigger than anybody else's pain. I, I, we administer schema questioners in schema therapy. So, uh, we will give the schema questionnaire to most of our clients, but that being said, the abbreviated version of the schema questionnaire is a parenting inventory and that's the one I, I might be more likely to give to someone who I suspect might have issues of narcissism. It, usually I know this as they're coming in, but for most therapists who, this isn't their, their, their niche, this isn't their, their particular boutique, practice, they wouldn't necessarily know that. 

00:31:10
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Uh-huh. 

00:31:10
WENDY BEHARY And so using a parenting inventory, a lazarus(ph), a multimodal life history inventory, here's how you know sometimes. They won't do the homework. It's almost like you're, you're setting it up, you give them the homework and they don't do it and there's another piece of diagnostic criteria because they're going to lambaste you with all kinds of reasons why this is stupid and ridiculous and your dumb little games and, uh, so they don't typically do the homework, so becomes another, it's kinda, you know, it's sort of an affirming piece of information in, in making your conceptualization about this client. I ask questions very specifically tailored to who gave you love and affection. You know, who held you. Narcissists will always say, I had a perfect life. Don't go digging in my childhood and a happy life, a perfect life. I have no trauma. Nothing going on back there. 

00:32:05
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:32:05
WENDY BEHARY And, you know, as we know, parenting's a hard job. Nobody's perfect. Nobody has a perfect life. And although they may not come from as many of our patients with borderline pathology. You know they may not come from, uh, extremely abusive, you know, capital T trauma types of backgrounds, they, they have what sometimes is much more insidious, that ongoing, um, attachment insecurity that comes from not having emphasis on unconditional love. They didn't get the unconditional holding, affection, praising, encouragement, understanding. A lot of emphasis on performance, being outstanding, being extraordinary, uh, servicing the egos of the parents, perhaps, that might feel, who might be immigrant parents who may be parents who are, sort of, special in their communities and wanting to continue to enhance their ego. There's a lot of, the origins can, can vary to some degree, although what we almost always find out by asking for stories and questions and images, is that there's one parent who's rather dotting, uh, and one parent who's very demanding and critical. So it's a confusing message for this client as an adult, or as a child growing up. You know that there's great demands on performance and proving yourself, and another parent who's doting, but usually doting because they need the child too much for themselves. They need the child too much to support their own sense of worth and, and success and meaningfulness as a parent and as a person. And so that's where some of this mistrust forms and this deprivation and this feeling of defectiveness for wanting the normal things that a child wants, like playfulness and silliness and, and love and, and affection and understanding. And they discard it because it's not available to them. So that's just the fragile underbelly of narcissism. 

00:34:00
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) So. Okay. So if, so, what I'm, I have gotten from where we've got, come so far, so in, in the first session you're finding your particular way of gauging(ph) the client and you're trying different ways in which you're, how you're gonna find your way in there and, and develop your particular stylist of relationship that you might have with this, this person. You are, um, communicating back a sense that you're, you're seeing something about them, and you're setting different terms for a relationship, and you're beginning to get this, a narrative. How do they, where'd they come from, how'd they become who they are? 

00:34:40
WENDY BEHARY (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk) Yeah. (crosstalk) Yes. 

00:34:40
RICH SIMON Um. And so, and then, if you pull back from that, if, and, and if this, so they, to answer that please do so. Um. To get people a sense of, so what, what is the therapy? So that, that's a first session, and it, and these, sounds like these relationships begin with a bang. It can be a very interesting joust in the opening, uh, and, and is it usually, how much time do you usually give to a first session of,of, with this sort of a client? 

00:35:10
WENDY BEHARY With this type of client I like to have 90 minutes. 

00:35:10
RICH SIMON 90 minutes. Okay. Yeah. Sounds like, yeah. 

00:35:15
WENDY BEHARY (crosstalk) You know, and, and, you know, the old 45, 50 minute session, not so adequate with this type of client. 

00:35:20
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. (crosstalk) Yeah. Doesn't sound like-. 

00:35:20
WENDY BEHARY (crosstalk) Because, you know, you won't see all the colors and you won't have enough time to really do the, the richest part of the work, you know, the most important part work. There's so much battling to do, games that you have to get past, you know, walls that you have to take down to get to the, the critical piece which is the experiential work and feeling of emotions and the connecting at emotional level. You know even sometimes persistently, and it takes a lot of persistence to be able to say, no tell it to me from where you're feeling it Tell me in a way that sounds more personal. Use the first person Joe. Tell me what Joe feels, what Joe feels. I don't know what you want me to say Wendy. I know, I know it's hard for you, but tell me what Joe feels. See if you could just sense Joe. Take a moment to feel Joe. So it's always, the therapy is all about, in schema therapy we're trying to, I'm trying to get past, it's like I'm trying to get in between this strong detached side that wants to cut off all access to emotions because the emotions are too dreadfully intolerable. And the other side which is this aggrandizing side, this approval-seeking side, this bulling side, that is going to fight. So you've got the flight side, right, from the survival system, and you've the fight side. What they don't have is a surrender site. They don't surrender to anything, but they do have fight and flight. And so I'm working with this detached protector that's looking to stimulate, sooth, cut off emotions, disappear, intellectualize to death, and then I have this other side that is going to fight me, sometimes aggressively, be critical of me, be condescending, be angry, be blaming, be a show off, be controlling, be obnoxious, demand more time, show up late, you know, all of the above. And so I'm working with those (inaudible ) but I wanna get deeper, to the lonely, um, shameful, sad, inadequate feeling little person who I know is, you know, being kept hostage behind the scene. And so it's the persistence of saying, and I say that, I mean we tell them what the, what the goal is in the treatment and what the belief is, and they'll say, that's ridiculous. What a bunch of nonsense. And they don't buy in right away. Um. 

00:37:50
RICH SIMON But you're explicit about it. You're saying, what we're doing and how my, so if I'm your, I'm Joe here, what are you gonna, what are you tell me and, and when do you tell me what the, what the, the goals are from you viewpoint of this therapy process? 

00:38:05
WENDY BEHARY (crosstalk) Yes. Once I have a good sense, you know, my, I'm pretty, I'm pretty, um, strongly committed to my conceptualization, or at least my strong hypothesis about what it looks like. The narrative story that I've collected, my experience just relating with Joe, I'm gonna tell him that, you know, it feels like there's a side of you, and we can call it detached Joe, the Joe that shuts down, the Joe that probably showed up on the scene, I think you said you were about nine years old when your mom became very depressed and your father was not around very often, and when he was it was all about your homework and all about your sports and all about, you know, your dad was pretty remote emotionally and your mom was pretty depressed and she wanted you to just lie in bed with her and make her feel happy and tell her funny stories. And, and little Joe sorta disappeared in there, became this detached Joe, who had to take over and not, not need anything. Not feel his own emotions. So he was kind of your protector. And I'd sometime sense him right here in the room with me. You know, as if he's still there. Sometimes he's there when you're on the computer all night, sometimes he's there when you're, uh, you know, maybe having one too many drinks at happy hour after you leave the firm in the evening, maybe he's there when you're sitting here with me and you just wanna tell me these, you know, intellectual stories because it's too hard to feel the feelings about possibly losing, uh, Kathy, your wife. You know, it's too hard to talk about that. So I sense there's a detached Joe. And then I also sometimes sense this other Joe, you know, the one that, you know, he probably represents the part of you who's just so angry about the conditions that were there for you. And also he's, he's a little bit like your dad, you know, the one who wants to prove to everybody that you're extraordinary and that you are special and that you're better than the average guy and, you know, when you're pointing at your car and you're trying to tell me that, you know, my, in my career, I couldn't possibly understand what it's like. So there's these sides of you and what they do is they, they cut us off from being able to feel this very important, precious little guy underneath, you know, who's been trapped for a long time. It's as if you're still living in the world you lived in before. And you've forgotten that you don't have to prove yourself anymore. And maybe there's actually people there who wanna love you, and care about you just for you. Hard to imagine, huh Joe. 

00:40:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:40:40
WENDY BEHARY You know. So it's, its, its, it's that way, in the context of the story, that it's becomes, uh, , you know, clear what the approach is gonna be. Well it's not that clear what the approach is. It's clear what the, the understanding is. 

00:40:55
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) The issues are. 

00:40:55
WENDY BEHARY They say, how you gonna do that? You know. 

00:40:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:40:55
WENDY BEHARY 

00:40:55
RICH SIMON And in my role as Joe, yeah. So, is the, is the ide,a I'm gonna just feel like I, I did when I was five years old? For this I'm paying you money? 

00:41:10
WENDY BEHARY Yeah we ge-, guess what Joe, you feel little all the time. It's just that you, you have these two amazing escape mechanisms. They're like big flashing exit doors. The moment you feel a sense of vulnerability, a threat, someone who might be competing with you, someone who might be even trying to care about you, which makes that, you know, that,uh, that box open up and it's uncomfortable for you, you can run to detached Joe or you can run to, you might call him bullying Joe or big shot Joe or whatever name he wants to use, cuz we try to make it more personal. Um. So I would say you run big shot Joe, you know, so you don't have to feel the little guy, but guess what drove you there? That's what drove you there, because he's there all the time. 

00:41:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:41:50
WENDY BEHARY It's just that you're not acknowledging the presences of that part of yourself and guess what? Like, you know, like a missing nutrient in your body, you can't just talk your way out of it. He still there and he still has needs because you're human like everybody else. Even though that's hard for you to hear because you're supposed to be better than average. But just like everybody else, you have needs. It's just too hard for you to acknowledge them, and detached Joe and big shot Joe won't let us get there. So yeah, we have to get there. 

00:42:20
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Okay. So we, we get, we get to the little Joe here and we, the five year old guy, and he has all these needs in whatever the story that you're telling me, and then I'm suppose to live the rest of my life like I'm five years old? 

00:42:35
WENDY BEHARY No. No of course not. Um. You can't live your life like a five year old but there's something about the, there's the vulnerability of the five year old that carries with it a, you know when you think, you know Joe, when you think about your own son, when he was five, you know, think about your son when he was five. And I frequently will use their children if they have children, and many of these men are actually decent fathers. Not all, but many are. And sometimes because they think, you know, somewhat implicitly they see their little self in, in their child. But I'll use the child or a child or an image of a child. I frequently use photographs on, I shouldn't say frequently. I always have photographs of my narcissistic clients when they were children. One of the first things they bring to me because I ask for it are photos. And we go through photos. Why do I do that? Because I, because it's so hard for them to believe that they have any vulnerability within, so hard for them to believe that memory plays any role in their lives until they look at photos. And when they see themselves as little beings, little vulnerable beings, there's a power, an evocative piece of the experience there that's just too hard to, you know, to, to miss. So I encourage therapists all the time, get photographs and use them. Have them in the treatment all the time. Make copies of them. They don't have to be fancy copies. Have a copy and you can hold it out and say, can you feel him right now? Right now? You don't have to be him all the time, but if you could take care of him and meet his needs like, it's like he's thirsty and you keep giving him peanut butter. It's not going to work. He's thirsty. Give him something to drink and that he's gonna be quiet and happy and peaceful inside of you, so you can go on being a, a decent guy. You don't need detached Joe and big shot Joe. You know. You're just, you're content. But first we have to meet his needs. Well how do we do that? But that was then, this is now. That's over. You can't change my life. 

00:44:40
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. 

00:44:40
WENDY BEHARY We can't go back into the time tunnel. 

00:44:40
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:44:40
WENDY BEHARY And I say, yeah we can. We actually can. We can't change what happened, and someday you'll actually come to honor that history. You know. It's your story. But what we can do is bring through our imagination this powerful sensation called, you know, re-parenting ourselves. You know in a, in a limited way. So, so grown-up Joe, healthy, wise, loving Joe can learn how to actually go inside his experience and take care of little Joe. Just like you would with your own child. And maybe even Wendy can do that for little Joe, if I can get close enough to him, in a limited way. You know, to help him to know that he's fine just as he is, and he doesn't have to keep proving himself to anybody. And then maybe he can be peaceful and you won't need that detached side or the big shot side. (inaudible) peace inside. 

00:45:40
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:45:40
WENDY BEHARY Right. So. And then there's, you know, there's a series of strategies that we use to try to keep alive that emotion, that experience, imagination, imagery, photographs, uh, chair work, transformational chair work, where they can experience the various modes in operation(ph). Something really interesting about changing seats and being able to feel this shift, right, in your personality. Feel this shift in, in the varying degrees of strength, of different sides of ourselves. So I always encourage the use of, of the chair work to get at emotions, not just as a cognitive exercise, but to get at emotions. Um. 

00:46:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:46:20
WENDY BEHARY And just the, you know, the therapy relationship, again, you know, once the narcissistic client kind of, it's like sort of breaking a stallion in some ways, I think of it, once they, they commit to the therapy, they get attached to the therapy and you've succeeded at having a relationship, forming a relationship with them. It's not that it's easy breezy at that point, but, you know, at that point you're better able to care about the parts of them that are just human. You know, that was sweet of you to ask how I was feeling Joe. You know, you noticed that I had a little cold. That was nice of you to ask. I appreciate that. And that's what I'm gonna praise. Not his thousand-dollar suit that he walked in wearing. 

00:47:00
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:47:05
WENDY BEHARY You know 

00:47:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:47:05
WENDY BEHARY I'm praising the ordinary things because this is the missing piece for this client. 

00:47:10
RICH SIMON So, in the, in the way that you just laid it out, in terms, is it, it, again the contrast between so those, the various, uh, methods and approaches that you described and also that process, that's also something I would imagine you do with your other clients. 

00:47:30
WENDY BEHARY Yes. 

00:47:30
RICH SIMON And it, and so what would be the difference in the, it's not(ph) so much in the elements of the work, is it? But is it, is it a, a difference in the, the tone? The level of sparring that's required of you in order to stay in proximity, emotional proximity with the client? Is that, is that the main difference? 

00:47:50
WENDY BEHARY (crosstalk) Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. It's just with, with my, with other clients, I mean some other types of personality disorder clients, um, it's, it's also difficult to get at the vulnerable parts of them. But not as difficult as with the narcissists. That is the greatest challenge in working with them is getting at their vulnerable, personal side. With other clients, yeah, they have detached sides. Some have angry sides of them. Some can have bullying sides but they're not narcissistic, they're, but they have a bullying side to them that's more oppositional or, or just tough, um, in ways to protect themselves. Uh. But it's just easier to get to the vulnerability. Like you said, and I think it's true, there's less sparring. There's a different tone. They're not necessarily out to prove something. And, uh, it's it's, they can take more into consideration the impact on you in the relationship as a therapist. 

00:48:55
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:48:55
WENDY BEHARY Uh. The narcissist, it's as if you're not even there because they don't, they don't see. You know, when they get on, how do I know this? Because once they get, they start to get well and they can be honest. They tell me, they'll say, I didn't even see you for a long time. You were like a faceless person just sitting there, just like an object that was there for me to try to nock down or, you know, convince that you're wrong or get power over you. They'll say, I was so preoccupied focusing on what I was going to say next, I didn't even hear you. It was just like there were words coming out of your mouth, but all I could think about was, how do I break in and interrupt her and, you know, and talk over her or make her wrong. So I was cleverly coming up with my script. I wasn't even listening. And they'll, they'll tell me what that's like. So you, you start to see the breakthroughs in the relationship when they start becoming more honest and they can take responsibility. And then they start noticing it outside in there world outside. And, and I use an audio flashcard with all of my clients, but especially with these clients because for whatever reason-. 

00:50:00
RICH SIMON An audio flashcard. 

00:50:05
WENDY BEHARY Yeah. They, they will listen to it. It's just a little, I was looking for my little device. I don't have it here on the desk. But it's just a little device, and even now with, you know, with the age of smart phones, everyone has recording devices in their phone. I take the little Olympus device and I record into it, and I'll just simply say, okay Joe, so you were very courageous today. You did a great job, but now you're listening, you're tuning in to listen to your flashcard, and this is your reminder. So remember, you said to me it's best for you, you feel like you have more connection with your vulnerability in the evening. So remember, you're listening now because it's probably evening. I know you have an event to go to tonight we're you get distracted and sometimes you talk over people and you don't listen. So connect with little Joe for a moment. Close your eyes, and I can give instructions through the flash card. And it can be very personally tailored to wherever we're at in the treatment. But I, I, I urge therapists to think about using this. It's a, it's a transitional object(ph) that carries your voice, that carries instruction, that keeps some, you know, continuity in the work, because God knows you need it with these clients. They hit the parking lot, or even the doorknob to the front door, and it's gone. You know, it's all gone. And you're sitting back going, wow we had a great session. I'm feeling great. Such a breakthrough. And they're already thinking, this is a bunch of nonsense. 

00:51:30
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:51:30
WENDY BEHARY So the audio flashcard enables them to keep some continuity with the work that you're doing in the treatment room. And it's really been, it's, you know, it's my observation, and I don't have scientific data on that, but I, I do have some confidence in, in the power using it. 

00:51:45
RICH SIMON So, uh, we have about ten minutes here. 

00:51:50
WENDY BEHARY Yeah. 

00:51:50
RICH SIMON So, so this sh-, let's, I wanna focus here. So you've given us a very rich and immediate sense of the give and take and what's going on in your office and the quality of this relationship. 

00:52:00
WENDY BEHARY (crosstalk) Oh good. 

00:52:05
RICH SIMON So you said a moment ago about this idea of when people have a breakthrough, what, what happen, what, what is the, the element? What makes you begin to feel that you, uh, what do you see or, and what do you, what do you think has happened in the therapy that shifts people from initial wary state, you don't exist, I'm into sparring, I'm more, I'm Chevy Chase, you're not, that state of being who this, what, uh, the, the second, the next phase of the work? What has happened? If you had, you had to describe it, what it, what do you feel like you've done, what shift, what's taken place in the therapy that brings people to that next phase? 

00:52:50
WENDY BEHARY Largely it's the, the of the relationship, and specifically the use of empathic(ph) confrontation, which is a strong, very strong strategy in schema therapy. Which means, you know, Joe I know you didn't mean to say that in a way to hurt me. Or maybe you did. I don't think you did though, Joe. I don't think that's really what you were intending to do. I think you're trying to protect yourself. But I gotta tell you, it's, it's hard to feel close to you when you talk in that tone. It's hard to even know what you're trying to say. Another example is, let's say Joe, this is, this is another true example. Let's say Joe suddenly gets angry with me because I've interrupted him. Then he yells at me. You know, you interrupted me. You said it's not nice to interrupt and look what you're doing, Wendy, you're interrupting. And I say, Joe, Joe, listen. Listen to your tone. You're trying to tell me something really important and I can't hear you because you're yelling and all I wanna do is put a shield up to protect myself. So Joe, there's something, there's an important message there. Now try it again and say it to me more personally. And say it to me respectfully because I'm respecting you. You respect me. We have rights in here. So use establish rights right from the get-go in there. And then he says, you know, well I just don't like it when, you know, it's like you get, you tell me I don't play by the rules but you're not playing by the rules so you-. I said, so Joe you could just say, Wendy that didn't feel fair. How about that? That's hard for me, Wendy. That's hard for me, but yeah, you're right. That's what it felt like. All right, so try it. That didn't feel fair. Good for you. It's literally like just, again, trying to get past these two predominant, uh, protective devices that have been designed to keep them from exposing any sign of vulnerability, any real intimate connection with someone on a personal level. And when they can, what you start to notice immediately is, they're just more personal. Not that they're necessarily friendlier or sweeter. They may be friendlier. They may be a little more thoughtful. But it's, they're just more real. You know. It's more real. It's more honest. You feel like to human beings in a conversation having an experience. And there's more revealing of the hurt, you know. As my one client said just before he began to go into some very important emotional work, and he was so scared, and he looked at me at the end of the session, and he leaned forward, and he said, what am I gonna do with all the hurt. You know. Once we open up that box, what am I gonna do with all the hurt? And I said, you know Joe we're gonna hold on to it together. You don't have to hold it all by yourself. And you don't have to hand it over to your two goons. We're just gonna hold onto it together. Okay. 

00:55:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:55:30
WENDY BEHARY All right. So it's, it's, it's very important. That's, that's the re-parenting piece. That's the essence of this limited re-parenting piece. 

00:55:40
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:55:40
WENDY BEHARY Cuz it's terrifying for them. And you wouldn't know it looking at him in his 1,000 dollar Armani suit, you know, carrying this big fat career and being very successful. You don't know that there's a lot of, there's a lot of fear underneath. 

00:55:55
RICH SIMON So a moment ago you used this term empathic(ph) confrontation. 

00:56:00
WENDY BEHARY Yeah. 

00:56:00
RICH SIMON And that's really central. So at, what's the difference between confrontation and empathic(ph) confrontation. Just so, sounds, and I know this from our previous conversations over the years about your work (inaudible ) very central here. 

00:56:16
WENDY BEHARY (crosstalk) Yeah. (crosstalk) Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:56:16
RICH SIMON So let's, I wanna make sure that people get (inaudible ). 

00:56:20
WENDY BEHARY Yeah. We've had a lot of good talks about this Rich. And empathic(ph) confron-, the difference, and, and confrontation is important with narcissists too. The yelling in your face, sometimes you just have to set limits and confront and say, cut it out. Joe, that's enough. Go take a walk, catch your breath, get some water, come on back. Okay. You're really, you're really out of line Joe, so stop it. 

00:56:35
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Yeah. (crosstalk) Uh-huh. (crosstalk) All right. 

00:56:35
WENDY BEHARY So sometimes it's, just stop. Empathic(ph) confrontation is where, you know, you're understanding, right. Empathy. I'm understanding, I understand that with your issues, you were allowed to say whatever you wanted to say, and in any way you wanted to say it. You were taught that there were no rules that you had to follow. You were never given the guidance that you needed. But Joe, in this world, in this life, there are rules and that's hard for you. And you don't get to have a separate set for you. I have other clients who are waiting outside. So I'm sorry. I can't give you an extra half hour today even though you feel entitled to it because that's the message you got. So there's empathy and there's accountability. And so you're confronting but with an understanding, an appreciation, of how they come to this. It's not that you're a bad person, you're evil Joe. It's that this is the message you got, but guess what? It's the wrong message and you weren't prepared to live in the world. And that's why you're having trouble. 

00:57:35
RICH SIMON Mmm. 

00:57:35
WENDY BEHARY So that's really kind of an example in a nutshell of empathic(ph) confrontation. 

00:57:40
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) That's great.All right. So let's pull back. We did, we have above five minutes here. So, so when you go through this process with those narcissistic clients that you have who stick with it, where are we? What is it, what are the changes these, these folks do not change their stripes completely? 

00:58:05
WENDY BEHARY No, they don't. 

00:58:05
RICH SIMON (crosstalk). What, what do we see at the end of quote "successful" treatment and, and give us some sense of what you, oh I don't know, your, your track record? What is it that people might expect from somebody's who's a specialist such as yourself and working with these clients? What kind of, crudely put, your batting averages in working (inaudible ) folks 

00:58:28
WENDY BEHARY My batting averages is actually good if the leverage is high. So if I have enough leverage to hold onto, meaning that, um, I can continue to put those reminders out there early on in the treatment about what's gonna happen if you don't do the work. Um. And I can, and I have the support of the people outside. The wife, the adult child, the job, whoever it is that, that's putting forth this, this consequence that's meaningful. As long as that remains intact then I can create motivation. And if you can create a motivation to do the work and you understand their profile, then you can do the work. Which means getting to this vulnerability, which you can expect in the end and what's always been the delay, for me, of working with his population is when you can get to the end of the road, what you're likely to see is someone who can actually appreciate the impact of their behavior on another person. That when you say things like, um, you know honey I, that was kind of triggering when you, um, you know, when you, when you said that to me last night. When you made the reservation without discussing it with me. I know it's silly and I know you're allowed to make your own choices, but it was kinda triggering for me that you did that. I didn't like it. You know. But they didn't rage. So they didn't come, go, go at it like, how dare you, who do you think you are, you know, I'm not going to that crappy restaurant. You start to see that there's some consideration in the way that they can conduct their communication with a partner, with other people. They, they just become more human, you know. There's less proving themselves, there's less having to, and I say the less. of this, less of that, because I, I don't, can't say that I, I don't know that I believe that anyone transforms completely. You know. Even beyond the narcissist. Maybe there are some miracles out there, but I think, you know, as human beings we're pretty complex. And I think as narcissism's really complex and really pretty, you know, well-entrenched material. So I think what you see is you see a little, you'll see less intensity, you'll see less frequency and you'll see quicker recovery. That's what you'll see. 

01:00:40
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Okay. All right. So, uh, let's take a moment and, so you've certainly opened a, a doorway to a certain kind of very challenging work. If people wanna follow an interesting work and if people wanna follow up on it, and they wanna take advantage of perhaps some resources you have on your website, training opportunities, and things to read, where do they go? What do they do? 

01:01:10
WENDY BEHARY Well they can read my book, Disarming The Narcissist. I'm writing the second edition this summer of the book with some new chapters, but the book has been out since 2008. 

01:01:20
RICH SIMON And, and this is, you get this through your website or what's, what's the best stores? 

01:01:20
WENDY BEHARY (crosstalk) Um. (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. They can get it through Amazon, through my website. My website is, uh, disarming the narciss-, www.DisarmingTheNarcissist.com. 

01:01:30
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:01:30
WENDY BEHARY They can certainly email me. Wendy.Behary@gmail.com. And, um, there's, there's lots of chapters for professionals on this now, because it's become so much more popular in the literature, and even in the general, you know, public arena. So there's some new chapters out. Keith Campbell wrote a book called The, um, Handbook of Narcissism, and I have a chapter in there on schema therapy for narcissism. There's a book coming up at the APA Press soon called Treating Pathologic Narcissism. There's a handbook of schema therapy with a chapter on narcissism. So I think even if you just kind of Google it in, schema therapy and narcissism, there's, there's a lot to read on my particular work and our approach in dealing with this population. 

01:02:20
RICH SIMON And workshops and other training opportunities to go up to disarming narcissists. 

01:02:20
WENDY BEHARY (crosstalk) Yeah, my website. Even just going to my website, there's a schedule of training programs and I keep that pretty up to date. 

01:02:30
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Okay. And that's, and that's disarming the narcissist or is that webiste-. 

01:02:30
WENDY BEHARY (crosstalk) DisarmingTheNarcissist.com Yeah. 

01:02:35
RICH SIMON (crosstalk). Dot com. Okay. That's great. 

01:02:35
WENDY BEHARY Thanks Rich. 

01:02:35
RICH SIMON Okay. And, uh, again, uh, reminding people as we always do, there's the comment board. This is the opportunity the important part of the conversation is keeping it going, and ripple effects. So, um, the, you'll see on your screen now just go up there. If you have a thought, take a moment here. If you have, uh, whatever you said, that it, what was it? An audio, what was the audio thing (inaudible)? 

01:03:07
WENDY BEHARY (crosstalk) Flashcard. (crosstalk) The audio flashcard. 

01:03:07
RICH SIMON All right. So you could remind yourself through your ordering(ph) a flashcard or just make a comment so that's, that's, that's always important to put things in language to remember individually, but also become as part of the collective conversation. Uh. If you have questions, uh, Wendy will be looking at the comment board. There's no guarantee she'll respond to things, but if she is moved to she, she might. Uh. In any case, the , the more group participation there is on the comment board, the more, I think, we all benefit. Uh. Wendy. 

01:03:40
WENDY BEHARY Yes. 

01:03:40
RICH SIMON Wow. 

01:03:40
WENDY BEHARY Thank you. 

01:03:40
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) Thank you. I just, just, uh, felt I had an emergent experience into your very interesting, uh, very immediate, and very skilled work. Thank you so much for spending time (inaudible). 

01:03:52
WENDY BEHARY (crosstalk) Thank you so much for having me. It's been a pleasure. Appreciate it. 

01:03:55
