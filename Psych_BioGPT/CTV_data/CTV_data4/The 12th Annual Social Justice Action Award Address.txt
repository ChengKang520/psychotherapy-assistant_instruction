MARIE L. MIVILLE The social justice selection of word, uhm, our winners are the Clementi family. Jane, Joseph and James, and they collectively came together after the loss of their son and brother Tyler who committed as a result of bullying hate crime. And so they've began to form a foundation focus on helping and providing assistance to LGBT people. They are here today to share with you their story on how they transformed a tragedy into a powerful social movement that now has major do-- donor funding and is now focusing on developing programs to influence every single school and university campus in the US and perhaps beyond, I might argue to fight bullying another horrible acts of bias. As Joseph, Tyler's father and a civil engineer so beautifully emphasizes the primary message of their foundation is turning bystander into upstanderds. In other worlds as he says there are three involved in any type of bullying situation, the bully, the victim and the bystander who sees it but does nothing to help. Joseph and his family want to share their messages that bystanders to hostile behavior have an obligation to get involve and defend those who are target, in other words to become an upstander instead of a bystander. Moreover Tyler's brother James for whom the loss of his brother was a life altering event that sent him on a path of activism and awareness for bullying, suicide prevention and LGBT rights envisions are youth culture where kindness is cool and respect is the norm. And finally, Jane, Tyler's mother a registered nurse, speaks passionately to parents and community leaders about the need to nor merely accepts or tolerate children who come out as LGBT but instead to embrace them as wondrous creatures of God. This is a family that is ripe-- ah, that is representative of all that is right in the world. Instead of turning off or inward as the result of losing Tyler to bullying they turned their feelings outward and toward to community. The very essence of what social justice advocacy and action is all about. And so that is why they are this year's winner. So it is my pleasure to introduce Jane, Joseph and James Clementi. Please join me in arousing welcome.

MARIE L. MIVILLE And I, I did wanna let you know that James is still on his way, he got caught in the famous New York Friday afternoon rush traffic. Ah, but he's on his way and he will be here soon. Uhm, okay, thank you. All right. 

00:03:45
JANE CLEMENTI I hope it he comes really quickly cuz he speaks right after me. So, I do wanna thank you, uhm, each and everyone of you and-- there you are Denis(ph). Uhm, we are very, very grateful to be here today at this afternoon and to be recognized by, ah, Teachers College here at Columbia University. Uhm, with Winter Roundtable, uhm, social justice award. Uhm, it's very amazing for us to receive such great privileges and, uhm, I thank you very much for that published be honor to today. And from this prospective to looking out it's a really good view because it's also very encouraging view to me to, to see the best and the brightest of our thought leaders here today gathered together all trying to bringing in to the, uhm, social injustices that's still continued to, uhm, persist in our word today. At the part of this event that I can't believe is that I am the one up here in the front of the room and then I am the one doing the speaking. Because I belong somewhere in the middle back there. I, I do not belong in this position. Uhm, and that is what is extremely, uhm, inconceivable for me is how that I got to this place and how does a simple quite very private person get to the front of the room and become the speaker. That's the unbelievable part. But, uhm, after the tragic death of my 18-year-old son by suicide. My life change forever. And it was-- as I was trying to put my life together again that I discovered that, that terrible tragic situation had actually created a passion and a mission within me and that was to share Tyler's story with anyone and everyone in the hopes that we could make a change for somebody else and make a difference in someone else's life. So, for anyone who does not know Tyler story. In September of 2010, just-- yeah! Sorry about that. My son James is arrived. Uhm, so, for anyone who doesn't know Tyler's story in September of 2010, just weeks after Tyler's started his freshmen year at Rutgers University Tyler was webcam in a sexual encounter with another man, uhm, by his roommate. And, uhm, then his roommate went and twitted about it, uhm, inviting all his friends to come in and join in the conversation and watch what was happening. Uhm, it was at this point that he was announcing to the entire world a very private personal moment that should have remain just that a private encounter. I can only imagine that hose bullying actions must have humiliated Tyler in front of his peers, in front of his new dorm mates that he was just meeting and be friending. I must-- I, I can only think that Tyler must have felt very alone, very isolated, uhm, probably very worthless and very desperate, uhm, by those bullying actions. Tyler might have even thought that possibly sexual orientation was something to be laugh at or to be ashamed because it was at that point that Tyler made a decision, uhm, that we can never change, that we can't undo no matter how hard we try. Uhm, because on September 22nd, 2010 Tyler died by suicide. And as I was coming out and waking up and trying to put my life together and our life together as a family we decided that actually that's what we needed to do was create change. We couldn't go back and change what Tyler had done but what we needed to do was go forward and change the attitudes and mind sets of people who thought that those types of activities, those bullying actions of setting up a camera or twitting and inviting other people to come in and, uhm, watch the show, come join us, join in and watch the show, I think was one of the text, uhm, that those actions are not acceptable. And to be clear that is just not an acceptable to form of a-- action for anyone. And that is why my husband and I Joe decided to found and find-- start the Tyler Clementi Foundation. We wanted to continue the conversation started in September 2010, around prote-- providing and promoting a safe inclusive and respectful space for all vulnerably youth. We wanted to make sure that no one would ever feel the pain or shame, or the hurt that Tyler face after he had been webcam while having sex with his boyfriend in his dorm room by his roommate. We also wanted to make sure that no one ever, uhm, hurt any teaching or, uhm, messages that would teach them or make them think that they were inferior or broken because of how God had created them. How God had created someone to love, someone at the same sex not because they were creating game. Uhm, more simply put the Tyler Clementi Foundation is working to, to stop all online and offline bullying in schools, workplaces and in faith communities. But it's not the technology that's bad or harmful it's, the, it's how does used, uhm, technology can be an instrument of good, it can keep us, ah, connected to our family and friends. It can speed up communication but technology can also be a weapon of destruction causing great harm and injury as in the lives of so many young people including our son Tyler. Technology is only as good as the people who use it and that is why we have to go deeper than the technology itself. We need to focus on the people using the technology, changing the thoughts and attitudes of the people. We must produce complete-- a complete culture shift, we must try to create a kinder, gentler society. Uhm, a society that embraces all members with human dignity and uncontrolled love-- unconditional love, sorry about that regardless of e-- all of our differences. Uhm, maybe even because of our differences, uhm, the world would be a really boring place is we were all the same. Uhm, it's simply actually wouldn't even function. Can you imagine if the world were made up of all poets or all scientist or all nurses, yeah. Or all psychologist, I think that would create a really harmful society, we need our, uhm, differences, we need variety, we need everyone to participate. It's just like, uhm, in music, imagine music e-- if there was only one sound no matter how beautiful that sound is imagine if there was only a violin. I think of violin because Tyler play-- played the violin so beautifully. And it was beautiful no-- sound but when he was accompanied by a piano it was even, it was even richer. And when he participated in all the orchestras that he did it was a really rich deep sound that really resonated great-- with great beauty. So we really need to teach our youth to embrace all the differences around us instead of using those differences, uhm, to intimidate someone or to harm someone or harass someone. And I do se-- think that there has been a lot of movement and a lot of shift, uhm, since September of 2010, uhm, there had been many conversation and there are many conversations around youth and around measures that schools must take to keep, uhm, our youth safe from harassment and intimidation. But even-- and even just the fact that they've identify that there are-- is a need to prevent bullying is a great example that we have made some progress. But there is a much larger picture, of much bigger picture. Harassment and intimidation and bullying is so much more than just that-- student in the playground pushing or shoving to get to the front of the line. Or the middle schooler texting, ah, a mean spirit of text because there's someone race or because of their gender identity. Or even the youth that sets up a camera in his dorm room sending images of his roommate because of the sexual orientation. No bullying can be and is so much more. It can be found in so many other ways in our society such in the way lawyers are written preventing all people from sharing in the same civil rights and benefits as the majority. I am pleased to say that there-- or has been change in that area too. For many reasons but I must admit there always a few personal reasons that will be shared later by our next speaker. Uhm, but don't be fool there's still many battles that's still need to be fought. Uhm, and many more, uhm, areas that we need to, uhm, continue to work in to pe-- continue to res-- make sure that there is protection and equality for everyone. Because with silence being most and really breaks my heart is when I look at where the push against ending employment discrimination or granting marriage equality comes from. What I see our faith communities, uhm, and that, that just breaks my heart. Because faith communities are professing to love and have great compassion and yet, in the reality they're causing great harm and hurt for many of our gre-- gay youth. And I do know that there will be change and it will take many voices to create that change. And the change that I'm hoping for and then I think believe most of you are hoping for in this audience. Uhm, we are pleased to be part of that change to Tyler Clementi Foundation, Tyler story has become part of that change and that movement. And part of the dialogue and conversation. But everyone has a story and one of the things that I've learned is that by sharing our stories we will have a tremendous impact and we can change people's thoughts and attitudes. So, uhm, sometimes it might be just changing one heart or mind at a time but on my home and goal is much larger that we will have a greater impact and that we will be able to change the, uhm, it make a difference in the whole, in our, in our world. Tyler was the youngest of threes-- of three of my sons. Uhm, my oldest son James, uhm, also works with the Tyler Clementi foundation sharing Tyler story. And I just wanna share that it has been a real pleasure and I can say this with the great pride that I have enjoyed watching him mature and grow and becoming an excellent speaker and spokesperson for the Tyler Clementi Foundation as well as a writer and he's also become and articulate and confident LGBTQ advocate and activist and that just, uhm, e--e that gives me great joy to what been able to watch them. And also-- but he also has his own story to tell and tonight, uhm, we are gonna be bless to hear him share a little of his journey and where he is today and then my husband will share a little of what the Tyler Clementi Foundation is up to today and where our goals and hopes will go to. So, he gives me great pleasure to let games come up in tell-- share his story. Thank you.

JANE CLEMENTI Hi. Uhm, good evening. I, uhm, apologize for being late we had some traffic on the way over here but I'm really happy to be here with you guys, uhm, tonight. And, uhm, Teachers College was really good to see our friends here. Uhm, so yeah, I, ah, I'm, ah, really emotional now, I always, uhm, get very worked up hearing my mom tell about, uhm, the journey that our family has been on the last few years but I am, uhm, very proud of my parents and, uhm, amaze that how strong they are to be able to, ah, to share that. And, uhm, to really advocate for change for other people as well and it's, uhm, it's just been such a, a process in the journey over the last few years. Uhm, and I would say that our family has really been on a big path, uhm, for my entire life. Uhm, I remember as a young child and as a young person just feeling very different and, uhm, you know, not really fitting in that really belonging, uhm, anywhere. And even before, uhm, I was old enough to understand that I was gay before even knew that gay people existed, uhm, just hearing a lot of messages, uhm, at a young age that, uhm, you know, really reinforced that, uhm, the sort of the norms in the world that were expected and, uhm, definitely made me feel, uhm, very trap in that. And, uhm, I did experience a lot of bullying and harassment, uhm, in middle school and in high school, uhm, not necessarily, uhm, because I was gay but just because I was different. I think and, uhm, maybe more quiet and more sensitive. And I never went through anything to the extent that Tyler did. And I didn't have an experience like that, I'm very happy to say. Uhm, and I also-- when I learn about what had happened to Tyler I was very shocked because I didn't think, uhm, things like that happen in this world. I just-- I had never heard of any case like this before and I, uhm, I couldn't imagine that, that would be something that can happen to my brother. Uhm, and, uhm, and, uhm, so and a lot of ways when, when Tyler went through his experiences and when he passed away, uhm, and for my family it was really like the, the rug was put out from under us and, uhm, we just had and expected that of course, uhm, and we were really sort of trying to put all of the pieces of the puzzle together but, uhm, you know, I, I think that-- partly I was so surprise because Tyler and I had, had a really, uhm, deep and honest conversation with each other a few months before he left her records, uhm, I had since back then that he might be gay for the last few year and I really, uhm, struggled with how to have that conversation with him. Uhm, I, I wasn't that out with my parents and, uhm, the idea of telling them that I was gay was so scary because I did fear in rejected by them. Uhm, and they were, uhm, at that point attending a very, uhm, conservative church and getting a lot of these anti-gay messages. So, Uhm, I never really felt comfortable telling and, and, uhm, I wanted to be as an older brother to Tyler, uhm, a role model for him and someone that he could be open with and, uhm, come and talk to. And at the same time I also had a fear that if I told him, you know, first of all what if I was wrong? He wasn't gay and that he might end told our parents, and, and they found out. Uhm, and there were just so many different scenarios that came into my mind so, uhm, it was something that I just continue to put off and I felt like we can have that conversation one day when he was older, when I was more ready. Uhm, and, ah, was just it became this thing that we never spoke about. And, uhm, a few months before he left for records actually in, ah, July this summer before he left, uhm, we did finally8 come out to each other and it seem to like in that moment, uhm, the start for a lot of new beginnings in our relationship. Uhm, I definitely thought that we were gonna have the rest of our lives together to, uhm, know each other and to experience, uhm, a friendship with each other on a more honest level than we had on in the past. So I didn't think it was an access of urgency to get everything out on the table all at once and it was, it was like a one conversation that we really had but I thought that were gonna be many more in the future. Uhm, but one thing that I told him was, uhm, that no matter happen to him when he was at school I definitely wanted him to know that he could always reach out and he come to me and talk to me with anything that maybe going on his life. And ultimately he didn't do that, ah, when everything happen with his roommate he didn't reach out to anyone in our family. He didn't reach out to anyone. And he really internalize it and carry that burden on his shoulders. And, uhm, you know, I've, I've spend the last several years of my life questioning and wondering why he didn't reach out and I definitely can understand why he wouldn't, uhm, go to our parents and ask them for help or tell them what was going on. Because I think for a young person, an 18-year-old kid dealing, uhm, being out as well as, uhm, you know being humiliated in such a public way I think that would be, uhm, a really embarrassing situation to bring to your mom and dad but I have, uhm, you know, real reasons or explanations for why he couldn't come to me and let me know what did happened and, uhm, so there's also been a lot of, uhm, guilt and things that have gone on my own mind about, uhm, why we're close enough and-- or why he didn't feel that he could trust me with that. But I think, uhm, you know, in the mind frame like he was in, in that time, uhm, things were so heavy and so, ah, painful for him that he really just wasn't looking at it as, you know, "Who can help me get through this?" It was more about, uhm, you know, numbing the pain and making the pain stop. Uhm, and that's been a really important message for our family and our foundation as well, ah, for young people that are actually struggling with crisis to be able to have, uhm, people in their lives so they can easily identify, uhm, that they will go to and talk to if something is happening with them and if, if they're struggling with things. Uhm, and so, yeah, I mean it's, it's been a lot of, uhm, pain and a lot of lost and tragedy in our lives, uhm, and that continues to be with us in the present easy although it changes shape and it changes-- the feeling of it changes as time goes as well. Uhm, and a few years ago I definitely would not have thought that our day would came and can I be really happy again. And I, I actually was would have been very wrong to think that, uhm, the last few years I've been, uhm, I found joy in some really surprising and unexpected places and I, uhm, as my mom was allowing too earlier. Uhm, I did wanna share with you guys that I'm gonna be getting married tomorrow on Valentine's Day. Thank you. Uhm, my, my boyfriend, my soon to be husband Ramon, uhm, and I have been-- we just really fall in love and, uhm, having just really happy in our, having planning this wedding for the last few weeks. And its just come together really quickly and we're really excited and, uhm, and, you know, it's just-- it's really it feels great to have my mom and dad, uhm, supporting it and, uhm, being so, so happy for us and really, uhm, you know, being people that I have and able to talk to you and lean on for support there at his whole journey. Uhm, and definitely as a younger person I would never imagine that I could have that. And so I've seen them in my own life how, uhm, sometimes you see that things are one way and your life in that people are very strong and very, ah, merged and what they appear to believe and feel. And you think, ah, especially if you don't have power, uhm, or it's that your younger person, uhm, depending in your parents or in needing, uhm, other people that have power over you in some way, uhm, or authority maybe is the word. Uhm, you know, and you see them, ah, very strong in this ways of thinking and you feel like that will never change and that always gonna be that way and either you have to change or you have to, uhm, you present yourself differently or, uhm, lose a relationship that is really important to you. Uhm, and you just can't ever imagine that 20 years later, uhm, things can be so different and sometimes it's not an instant thing that happens I think, uhm, and our family has been a really slow evolution and process. And, uhm, I don't know it just that I'm very proud of my mom and dad for the, the personal growth that they've had in the, uhm, evolution that they've had. And I'm really, uhm, grateful to have them in my life and could be so, uhm, close with them. And actually working with them as well as, uhm, just being a family that was been really amazing. And so I'm really in a great move. Uhm, I'm a little tired honestly but, uhm, it's been a training couple of weeks but tomorrow is gonna be an amazing celebration. And, uhm, a lots of things in the years to come to look forward too. And, uhm, yeah, we, we have been working really hard as a family and, uhm, we also have an executive director of our organization shun who is not here today, he's in North Carolina. Uhm, but, uhm, you know, we're really been growing as an organization and we have a lot of programs going on and, uhm, I wanted to talk more about the personal side today and, uhm, my dad is actually gonna share with you guys more about the organization and what we actually doing with the Tyler Clementi Foundation. So, thank you all very much. 

00:26:00
JOSEPH CLEMENTI Good afternoon everyone. Uhm, it's really very especial pleasure to be here now we really, ah, ah, feel very special to be honored today. Ah, when we first started the Tyler Clementi Foundation we knew that something had to be done and we knew we wanted to make things better for kids like our son Tyler. But we didn't exactly know how to go about doing it. After all like our son we're just ordinary people who found themselves in an extraordinary situation. Fortunately we receive the lot of help along the way from people who came to our lives in the last 4 years. People who knew they're needed to be change and wanted to make a difference. Over the last 4 years we've grown from a startup where ideas were disguised with the couple of friends in the part on weekends to an organization with a full time executive director, full time staff or another one coming on board very soon. And the 12 member board of directors that, ah, has in its minds on becoming the fought leader in the space for all things bullying, anti-bullying. And we're all on our way to doing just that. Now as James has said, uhm, he's getting married tomorrow. Well, if you go back to 2010 when we started the organization he wouldn't been able to do that in New Jersey, New York and now he can. So when changes gradually sometimes don't notice it, it's, it's incremental. But things today are very much different and I think things are getting better and we'll continue to get better. Let me tell you a little bit about what we're doing since 2015 at the Tyler Clementi Foundation our programing. In addition to our upstander speaker series where Jane, James and myself is the power of story to move people to action our upstander legacy-- our, our-- excuse me. Our upstander pledge where we ask people to take personal responsibility for their actions. We're rolling out several new and exciting programs this year that are like to give you some information about. First our day one initiative, Day one is a new initiative with potential Global Reach, day one is wa-- would be a downloadable script which presents a code of conduct from day one that can be implemented in a classroom, a club or what have you, anywhere were young-- excuse me. Anyway that come from. Ah, anywhere where young people interact with each other establishing on day one what we will and will not tolerate in our school, our classroom, our club, our team, our organizations. In 2015, we're also rolling out workplace, options, training initiative. Everybody knows or you, you may know, ah, what an Employee Assistance Program is, ah, an EAP. Well, there's a company called Workplace Options, WPO, that's the world's largest provider of employee affect in the services that are use in this EAP program. WPO has 42,000 client companies that represent 46 million employees around the world. WPO is ask the Tyler Clementi Foundation to design an anti-bullying curriculum that will result in the training initiative that will become available to those 46 million people in those 42,000 companies. The training would focus on youth bullying and how those 46 million employees can address that problem in their homes. So it isn't just about the workplace about somebody who might be having problem at home and getting assistance through the workplace by the EAP program. The training will focus on, uhm, and special, ah, excuse me, sorry. A special thank you has to go out to Teachers College that will providing the, ah, fellowship and the fellow Michael Palmieri for developing the curriculum. Also in 2015 look for the, ah, Tyler Clementi center at Rutgers University to do enhance programing, proving quality and, and quantity. That's all what be done in records in Rutgers. On the legislative front of course continues, we continue to support the passage of the Tyler Clementi anti-- Tyler Clementi higher education anti-harassment act which is the only bill right now that would require institutions of higher learning that accept federal money to have an anti-harassment policy for the students. I'm sure many of those organization if not all of them have that policy for their employees. But not all of them have it for the students so that's why we think it's important. 2015, the Tyler Clementi Center for Law and Policy at New York Law school, that's the one down here on Barrack Street will be in operation. Right now the TCCLP is ramping up and will include a first of its kind direct service litigation clinic to help victims of harassment obtain justice and provide needed prospective and in fact effective legislation. The TCCLP will educate students, attorney's, judges and the public about the problem of cyber bullying. We'll also provide direct service to help families, policy makers and schools reduce and ameliorate the effects of cyber bullying, bullying of our at risk youth. That's a lot, and but that's not all that we have plan for 2015. There is some things that my team well, let me talk about right now. So, I'll have to be reticent on that but, uhm, t here will be a surprise a surprise or two along the way, one of them maybe sooner than you think and, ah, then you'll, you're about it. Ah, I do mean that in a good way. So if you keep an eye out on what we're doing you visit the website at tylerclementi.org and you can get the latest news. Ladies and gentlemen on behalf of or-- of the foundation Jane, James and myself, ah, we thank you very much for this honor this means are a lot to us. And most of all we thank you for what you do. Well you're at this Roundtable and you're getting charge up with all these, all these information and you gonna take it back to your organizations when you get back in our operations. And I just suggest to you that you have a lot more power to make change than, than you might thing. The way you act, the way you behave will project to your students, your colleagues, your peers, the right way, the correct way to, to, ah, in-- interact. And to the extent that you do that they will follow your lead, they will, they will take your leaders, ah, as to what you do. Uhm, so what I'm saying to you is ladies and gentlemen if you wanna see change in the world you have to be that change you'll be the change. Thank you. Good night I'll see at the reception.

MARIE L. MIVILLE Thank you Jane, ah, James and Joe, uhm, such beautiful words and, ah, such an inspiring story. And so now we'd like to, uhm, present to you the award. And so we have two things, ah, to present to you, one is the traditional plaque that goes with most awards and then the second one is because here at the Roundtable we like to take a very personal touch with what we do. So you remember we ask for names of people who know you. So what we did was we ask them to tell us, share with us what so special about all of you. And so from that we've wrote up a citation. And so I've ask the very special person to read that for you. And so I'd like to bring Janice Robinson vice president for Diversity and Community Affairs right here with the College to read that citation for you. Janice. 

00:35:10
JANICE ROBINSON Thank you Prof. Miville. But first, congratulations James. All right. Give him a big hand. My goodness. And thank you for those deepen and personal words that you shared with us. As you know Teachers College is very honor to be partner, ah, in partnership with the Tyler Clementi Foundation and we look forward to the continue work that we do. And it's an honor of being to read the citation to you. So, the trustees and president of Teachers College Columbia University present the citation of achievement to Jane, Joseph and James. When I think of the Clementi fou-- family, I immediately think of the word, "resilience" in the face of an awful tragedy they have set their sights on rebuilding their family, their community and the world. Following Tyler's passing their journey and their options were varied, they could have gone home, grieved quietly, privately and stop the conversation the painful conversation. Instead they chose to bring light to darkness. Face with the horrific family crisis, the Clementi family pick themselves up and were determine to find the solution to one of the most important social issues of our time. Working under difficult circumstances this loving and carrying family, just kept going exploring new ways to improve the lives of marginalized people. They are tireless and their efforts to educate other who may have no fundamental understanding of the LGBTQ community and they do it with openness, patience and grace. The Clementi family step out of a very private dark place in the hope that they could help other kids like Tyler and other parents and siblings like themselves in the hope that their story, their experience could bring like into darkness. By doing so they have saved lives. The Clementi family's bravery selflessness and incredible grace through hardship has been inspirational. They are the most powerful of heroes in social change. They do not crave the spot light but if harness the attention on their lives, lives and use it for good. One of the great things about the Clementi family's work is that it touches all types of bullying not just at school but at church, in the family, and in society and general. At the launch of the Tyler Clementi foundation. Jane Clementi student form a room of 300 well healed folk and spoke about the hope she wanted to bring to everyone in the room and beyond the walls. She steadfastly held on to her Bible even opening it to read out to us about being a prophetic voice then she end it saying that she did not know if she would ever accomplish, ah, ah, a change , a charge. Simply put, the Clementi's are heroic beyond measure. They've accomplished a lot in a short time and in doing so the Clementi's have kept Tyler's legacy moving forward then dignity and grace as it firmly rooted in their love for him and each other. The Clementi's have touch the lives of people they will never know. They have save lives of young people who they will never meet. They have shifted thinking in churches, homes, schools and even the government. They have prompted the changing of hearts and minds in ways that improve our world. Through their work speaking, advocating, and driving the conversation of inclusion the Clementi's have embrace the LBGTQ community in a way that highlights that we are all connected. That we are all part of one human family and that assault against one is really an assault against us all. We are all responsible and we must stand up together. The Clementi's understanding the importance of turning bystanders into upstanders because it not only as the right thing to do, it can also-- it also gives value and preservation to all of our lives. The Clementi's work and support has been ground breaking to. To witness how the Clementi family handle this incredibly public tragedy continues to amaze me. Their personal strength, grace and determination turned a horrific event into a social force that is changing the world. The Clementi's are an incredible example of an ordinary family fulfilling his potential to do extraordinary things. Thank you. February 13th, 2015.
