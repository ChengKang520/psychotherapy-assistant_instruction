CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS I am Dr. Cyrus Marcellus Ellis. I am a core faculty member of the Counselor Education Supervision Faculty in Governor State University. And this is a course on basic psychopharmacology. I'd been a faculty member at Governor State for 15 years, and prior to that I am alumnus of University of Virginia's Curry School of Education, and as well as a 20-year veteran of the United States Army. Well, thank you for joining us today on this important block of instruction. And welcome to you. This is a course on basic psychopharmacology. The purpose of this course is to understand how pharmacology works in the body with particular mood disorders. The reason that we start with the basics is because most medications that we use always go into the brain to make the difference in terms of what we call how do we regulate a physical system that is dysregulated. But before we get into all that good stuff, we have to understand some key basic terms of psychopharmacology. First, let's deal with the word "psycho", meaning not psychotic, but the physiology of pharmacology. So first the word "psycho", P-S-Y-C-H-O. What are we talking about? We're talking about a great many things. First, we're talking about psychology. In the basic understanding, that refers to one's mental state. So we have to understand that it's not just about that you have medication for particular disorders, but that an individual who will take this medication has a particular mental state that goes with it. For example, they might be apprehensive about taking medication, they might be scared to take medication. So a helping professional, a medical doctor and the like are always concerned with the mental state of the individual taking the medication. The other dimension of the psychology of pharmacology is to recognize what the meds are made for in terms of depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorders and the like. So there's a psychology of disorders and there's a psychology of the individual who will take the medication. We're most concerned with one's mental state toward taking medication. It's one thing to have them in your cabinet, it's another thing to actually take it as they are prescribed and addressing a lot of the other issues that come with taking medication. All of that is in one's mental state. So that's the first dimension. The second dimension that we worry about is the word "pharmacology". That has about three key components of that word, then we put it all together and you'll see why this is such a important topic to discuss. So with pharmacology, we're concerned with how a particular medication is first made. And that's a heavy, heavy topic and this is not the form to really talk about all the chemistry that goes into the making of medication, but you still are force concerned with pharmacology, about how a drug, it's made, is made. So the second dimension is the use of that medication. Is it for "headaches"? Is it for emotion? Is it for anxiety? So that's the second dimension of pharmacology. The first was how it's made. The second piece is what it's primary use is for. The third, in this area we stress a lot in this kind of a course is the side effects. That third dimension of its side effects are of great concern. Because of the first dimension, the chemistry of the medication, it will have a lot of different impact in the body. So what we will concern ourselves with in pharmacology, not besides how it's made, not besides how it's used, but the side effects that will go with that medication. In a lot of cases, you'll find that the pharmacology of a drug, you will see how it has different uses because side effects might not be great when we're treating a mental health disorder like depression, but some side effects help you go to sleep. So we use it for people who have sleep disorders. So it's in the pharmacology that we find out all the great things that a drug can do. So the psychology of it, one's mental state and the corresponding psychological disorder that it goes with. The pharmacology, how it's made, what it's used for, and most importantly, the side effects that go with it. Put all that together, you now have psychopharmacology. So most clinicians who study psychopharmacology or some just say pharmacology and then they automatically add the psychology piece to it are concerned about what is the mental state of an individual who has to take this particular medication for a particular disorder and has to address the side effects that go with that medication? In a course of psychopharmacology, that's where we start. Another piece that's quite… Well, it can be quite difficult to understand, is now that we understand the first piece of psychopharmacology, now we must talk about the body system. And the body system is all about regulation. I'm gonna do with my air quotes to talk about normal. As a, as a council educator, I don't like using the word normal too much. But the brain operates "normal", then our system is regulated. Our central nervous system is regulated, our organ systems are regulated and everything "is normal." Psychopharmacology really isn't introduced to help an individual recognize that there are particular systems of the body that aren't as regulated as they could be, or they're dysregulated. So now we use pharmacological intervention to help regulate those body systems. And where that… where ground zero is for that is in the brain. The brain is the CEO of the entire system. It tells us to do everything, pharmacological intervention as it were works to regulate particular brain systems or help the brain regulate the lower systems because they're out of regulation from, for various reasons. So if we're going to understand psychopharmacology, the first building block to that understanding is knowing how the brain is meant to work. So we are a network of systems, as I've said. The brain is the communication center for those systems. Thousands of interconnected neurons send messages throughout our body through that network in the brain. And we have to understand how that system works so that when you take medication, particular medication, not like Aspirin or Tylenol as much as harder medications or more interventionist medications like Prozac, Paxil and things of that nature, the brain's where everything's going to happen. So we have to understand how the brain communicates. To do that, we call that understanding synaptic transmission. That is a, that is a chemical process that sends signals throughout the body. It makes us happy, it makes us sad, it makes us worried, it makes us want to fight, it makes us want to run, it does everything through this process. So let's first talk about that process, and a few key words that we have to understand that drive the train as it were of our brain communicating. For our brain to communicate, it needs particular messengers. Those messengers are typically called neurotransmitters. And there's a few key neurotransmitters that control particular functions of the body. For example, there's the favorite one for people like me, and that's called dopamine. Dopamine is a, is a neurotransmitter that addresses a great deal of how we get things done. It's a motivator type neurotransmitters. We have Serotonin. Many people hear about Serotonin, that's our happy neurotransmitter. We have one called G-A-B-A or GABA. The GABA neurotransmitter is the one that allows us to be social, it allows us not to have a high degree of anxiety. So the more G-A-B-A you might have, the less, the less anxious you may be. We have norepinephrine, that is one of those flight type neurotransmitters. It gets into the body, it sends a signal to get ready. We have a acetylcholine, that neurotransmitter is one that works in the body system to get us to understand how our muscles will get going and get energized to be active, and to respond to what's in front of us. And then we have epinephrine, another glucose releasing neurotransmitter. You need glucose to get that energy up. That's why you see, see so many people grab soda-pop, some people grab a snickers bars. I think they make commercials over grab this sweet and get going to reduce, to induce and have those neurotransmitters kick in till you have, you have the energy to do the things that you want to do. So those neurotransmitter are in our body systems, there are some others, but these are the ones that really lay themselves to what we talk about in future videos about how we address particular mood disorders through a pharmacological understanding. Now that's the communication neurotransmitter. We have to now talk about how they get from point A to point B, to point C and all throughout the body. And that's the other dimension of symnat, synaptic transmission. Each of us have these thousands and thousands of neurons in our body. The best way to picture that, from my years of experience, is to think about grapes after you've eaten them and you're left with the stems. At least I call them stems. If you were to take a bunch of already eaten grapes and the remaining stems are sticking together in a big old ball, you'd have a visual picture of what the neurons might look like in our brain beneath all the tissue that the brain covers. And each neuron has its base, and it has long tentacle-like apparatus to it, and we call those axons. So each neuron has a base and a highway which we call the axon. So for us as human beings, to have communication in our brains that go out to our body, that neuron must do some things to make us work. So when things are once again "normal", the neuron has an action potential. It gets charged up and it has a thing called a synaptic vesicle. A vesicle is like a vehicle. All the neurotransmitters we just talked about get inside that vesicle, and it fires, just like a firecracker and it goes down the axon. It's headed to another neuron that's close by. When things are working correctly, they get to the end and there's a thing called a terminal button. At the terminal button part of this axon, vesicle is about… is prepared to open and release these neurotransmitters. And yeah, think about hundreds and thousands of these in your mind, this is happening all the time, every second, every millisecond, going on. So they're going to release these neurotransmitters into a place we call the synapse or for some the synaptic cleft. It's a little minuscule space between the two. And it releases into this synaptic cleft, and what it's supposed to do is go across that cleft and attach to the neuron… the axon of the next neuron in the line. We call that a pre-synaptic neuron, where everything is already packets and going down the line, and a post-synaptic neuron, where it's about to receive. So you have X amount of neurotransmitters being released and you have, in the post-synaptic neuron, all these little receptors ready to receive what just was released. And they connect, and they receive the messages and then they fire and continue to go down the line. So when the brain is working properly, the neuron has an action potential, these neurotransmitters get into the vesicle and they fire. They release into the synapse, they get collected on this side and they goes down the line. Now we can respond, now we can focus, now we can be happy, now we can be adjusted into all those kinds of great things. The beauty of the brain when it's working normal is that there always seems to be enough neurotransmitters going into the synaptic cleft and being picked up by the next neuron so that the messages are loud and clear. That's an army term we used to use. "How are you reading me?" "Loud and clear, I know what to do. I am okay. I see the spider, I'm going to run." That's what it does. As for my case, I see the snake, I am really running. Everything is working fine. Because there's usually enough going across, our bodies even produce sometimes a little bit extra. We call this re-uptake, where you have enough received so the message can go forward, that which is left behind gets reabsorbed and destroyed. So when it's working "normal", we have the process where everything is communicated from one neuron to the next. In that way, the body works well, that's how people are adjusted, and that's why we don't tend to give medication when medication is not necessary for people who are temporarily sad. They have the ability to recognize that "I'm sad today, but I'll be better tomorrow. I gain perspective." Enough neurotransmitter is going from point A to Point B. That's an important concept to realize when we talk about psychopharmacology, because then we recognize how the person is regulated because they have adjustment. The outward signs and symptoms of an individual do not suggest that we have to intervene with particular medication and help regulate their body system. Now what's important about basic psychopharmacology is the concept of what can we do for ourselves versus what we do with medication. One of the foundation pieces that we talk about in psychopharmacology is, "Are we up to the social skills task of being alive?" Whereas we reach inside of ourselves or use our social assets to help regulate our body systems. Here is where we talk about development and we asked the question about nutrition and diet. How well are we eating? Where's our vitamin levels and so forth? Because our brain needs nutrients to operate completely and fully. We talk about, at one level, basic safety in terms of seatbelts, helmets and all those kinds of things to protect the brain in its, in its development. Any basic course or any journey that begins with the basic course of psychopharmacology ought to have or needs to have that dialogue about social skills, about stress and the impact of stress on the body. Stress attacks, whether we want to believe this or not, many of the neurotransmitters that our body makes. So the more stress we have, the less, the less of the ability we have to calm ourselves down, will impact the way our brain chemistry works. That drives a conversation about those vices that we have in our society that get in a way of how well we address our brain chemistry. There are many things that we can do and need to do to regulate our systems. First, sleep. Human beings need to have regular and good sleep. The body needs to shut down. And it needs to regenerate itself from rest, good rest. Second, we have to worry about our anxiety. Before we talk about the actual disorder that deals with anxiety, like generalized anxiety disorder, we have to talk about the ability as human beings to address our fears and address all the things that cause us grief. We have to have good nutrition. Candy bars play a role in our lives, that's okay. But an excess of sugars hinders the brain's chemistry. And we have to watch out for that. Chaos in the home, chaos in society, chaos in life, all things not good for a basic understanding of the brain as CEO of our bodies. Once we get a handle on addressing ourselves and doing the thing that our bodies can do, which is address its own issues, we are better off when it comes to addressing mental health disorders. We look for and always strive to go against the urge to take a pill. We now live in a pill based society, we live in a one-pill-fix-it mentality society. Many of the ills that we have as human beings can be addressed by better social skill obtainment, better areas to know when to slow down, meditate, pray or just have serene time, one for ourselves. That's an aid to how we address our particular basic psychopharmacology understanding. Whether or not we do it as human beings and whether or not what we are struggling with becomes a disorder, future videos now will address that. Does anybody have any questions? 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN Yes, I have a question. Umm… you mentioned that people can affect their brains and their bodies through social skills, you know, like reducing stress, through nutrition and different things like that. So what would you say to the critics then that say, "We don't need any pills to help people with mental health disorders, all they need to do is live a better life and better nutrition?" 

00:21:45
CYRUS MARCELLUS ELLIS I understand that argument. And at a particular level, I agree that in, in "normal development," yes, the better you are at social skills, the better you are at addressing stresses in your life. You can have a positive outcome to life without the aid of particular pharmacological interventions. However, that would… if that was the only place I rested that argument, it would negate the science of the human body. We, we do have, and, and data does suggest that without particular neurotransmitters present, you run yourself into social-emotional problems. So while stress relief that you can do through meditation and or yoga type activities can aid you, that operates on the premise you have all the tools in your brain necessary for that to be effective. There are those in a great many of us who lack particular neurotransmitters in our brain, whereas meditation will aid, it will not erase nor address the social-emotional mood disorders that flow from lacking particular neurotransmitters in your body.
