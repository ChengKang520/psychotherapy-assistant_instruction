Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes 

00:00:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Hello and welcome. I am Mary Bradford Ivey. 

00:00:30
ALLEN IVEY I am Allen Ivey. 

00:00:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And we are going to talk about therapeutic lifestyle changes, otherwise known as TLCs. I'll start a little bit with a few slides and then Allen will come in and then we'll, kind of, go back and forth. So here we go with therapeutic lifestyle changes. Therapeutic lifestyle changes are key to stress management and a healthy lifestyle. TLCs are researched-based and provide specifics for better mental and physical health. They directly impact the immune system. TLCs produce neurogenesis and new neuron-networks. We now think they are as important or more important than theories of counseling for effective counseling at therapy practice. Now, as we present these lifestyle changes, it's important to state that we are not physicians, and most likely you aren't a physician either. Thus, any major changes need physician referral. TLCs originated in medical practice, and if you check Wikipedia, you'll find many examples of how they are used. As far as we can tell, we can credit Stanford Heart Studies as the origin. Their original focus was on Type A behavior, the stressed-out lifestyle of many who have heart attacks. Counseling, diet and exercise had become basic in prevention and further heart attacks. On the left side of the slide, you'll see key results of this prevention program over the years. The three majors of cholesterol all improved, as did blood pressure. Weight loss and less Type A behavior result. TLCs moved beyond this early Stanford's work, but again, remember that we are not physicians. Now, we'd like to stop the tape for a minute. Allen and I have a summary of your TLCs in your handout. Please assess your own approach to therapeutic lifestyle change on a 5.0 scale. We want you just to take about five minutes to complete the scale. You can take it now, we will look at it later in the session. And don't over think, just respond rather quickly. You might want to toll the numbers, but this is not essential. And, Allan, you want to explain this a little bit further? 

00:02:40
ALLEN IVEY Well, I really hope that everybody has the handouts which we supplied with the video that we made. But just in case, I know handouts can get lost, we hope that you have a handout, but you can, if necessary, stop this and have somebody read this and type here as much to a small, of course. But if somebody sits there and reads this, you can get a good summary that stop self assessments we'd like him to make. This is page one and on the next slide is page two. So you can move back and forth and look at the, look at the two and pause appropriately. There is also the self-evaluation of general lifestyle. So we'd like you to pause for just a moment before we go on and assess where you are on these lifestyle changes. I'd like to talk about the Mankato Nun studies. Basically, we had 678 Roman Catholic Sisters, they were aged 76 to 100, and they donated the brains at death as a way to look at what happens to the ageing brain. Particularly though, they are looking at the issues of dementia, Alzheimer's. What happens over time with this people? They did an annual cognitive exam. Well, what happened on autopsy, I want to read this, "On autopsy, 25% to 67% characterized as non-demented, fulfilled pathological criteria for dementia at autopsy." What that means and they had many tangles and plaques they didn't analyze. Yet, despite measurable, demonstrable problems in the brain, these people diagnosable with Alzheimer's may very well have been diagnosable, but they function normally. And interesting, look at that bottom line "8% with the most severe spread of Alzheimer's had not shown any symptoms of memory loss." Why this is critical is that Alzheimer's is not a death sentence. If you live the stress effectively, have a good lifestyle, you can live very effectively a very long time. Well, what made the nuns do so well? Maintaining a brain health. I love this quote from Nietzsche and Viktor Frankl, "Those who have a why will find a how." A reason for living, purpose in life is one of the central issues you are going to have. And obviously, if you are a committed nun, you have a purpose and meaning, and also, by the way, a focus at others rather than on yourself. There is some danger I think in the 'I' focus of the I, I, I focus, the issue is how are you are a person in relationship. If you recognize this, you're already committing yourself to a better lifestyle and cognitive health. Also, these nuns were very active. In cognitive activities, they taught, they knitted, music, played cards, puzzles and games. Extensive reading is very important. They found that the nuns, who did the best, have read the most as a child. So again, we're gonna back to issues of social justice of a child does not exposed to lots of words, is not read to, in effect, already they have cognitive issues coming up. So reading is very important throughout the lifetime, I think particularly important for children. Needless to say, they eat well, they eat consistently, they obviously socialized and these nuns also exercised. Prayer is a form of meditation. We are strong believers of therapeutic lifestyles and meditation. And prayer, done mindfully, consistently does forms much the same structure as meditation. Meditation by itself, mindfulness meditation has demonstrated to be very effective. We'll talk more about that later. But spirituality and prayer are important part of a healthy lifestyle. I like this quote, "They lived well, they used it and they didn't lose it." Used it or lose it and they used it. Now, let's look at Alzheimer's risk factors. What causes Alzheimer's? Stress and lifestyle issues. Okay, out of the stress and lifestyle issues, look at this, atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol, tobacco, exercise, diet. These are eight of the main causes of Alzheimer's. All of these relate to lifestyle. Atherosclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol, tobacco, exercise and diet. Out of this, by the way, can come A-fib and angina, but the others in red are very clearly related to the lifestyle and stress. And stress, by the way, of course builds angina. Stress will increase A-fib, atrial fibrillation. Now the Mayo clinic adds age, obviously, a risk factor for Alzheimer's. Family history, genetics, environment, also epigenetics, that means that trauma events in ones life or difficulties can change the genetic structure and propose more often, more easily towards Alzheimer's. But alcohol is a lifestyle factor identified by, uh, Mayo clinic. Obesity greatly increases the chance for Alzheimer's. High blood pressure increases, again, a result of lifestyle. Depression, which I know I haven't read, but actually that is a result of lifestyle for many, perhaps even most people. So lifestyle is real critical in all of these physical issues. Again, think brain-body, body-brain, what happens in one's lifestyle effects, very deeply effects the brain and the body. The stuff on the nun's came out in 2001. I want you to notice the title there in 2001. "Believe it or not, this 91-year-old nun can help you beat Alzheimer's." Think of the positive orientation there. If you do what the nun's do, you can help avoid Alzheimer's. That was the push in 2001. Along comes pharma and Mayo for] research on Alzheimer's. Next thing you know, we're doing (inaudible ) other kinds of meds and so forth. And you got this picture, 2010, of a woman with half a mind. Alzheimer's, you can't really beat it, we got to live with it. Yes, it's a dangerous, bad, awful disease, but things can be done with it. Before I go further, I do want to say I read a recent study… I try to stay up with literature, and also more recent study I read took five patients, you can't generalized widely from five patients, but this is what happened. These five were, were diagnosed specifically with Alzheimer's and they put it in an intensive lifestyle program and in effect. Four of the five returned to work. Alzheimer's is not a death sentence. Alzheimer's is not a death sentence. Every time you do effective counseling, every time you help a person to develop new neuro connections, help them develop a healthier lifestyle, you are preventing Alzheimer's. You are also preventing physical disease. You are preventing obesity, you are preventing a wide variety of disasters in life with a positive approach. Missing most… The most part, sad to say, in counseling a therapy, who focus on problems and disorder rather, "What is a person doing right and what we can do to build health?" Along with this chronic stress impacts DNA and shortens Telomeres. Telomeres are basically a sign of aging, and they're the protecting casing at the end of the DNA strands. They are injured by stress, aging and disease, and it leads to this heart attacks disease, et cetera. And maternal stress, and child neglect to this. We are again back to issues of social justice. And also, changes reward process. We start wanting comfort food, and Americans have a great need for sugar, which I equate now with poison. And I am an addict, I am a sugar addict. Every time I take sugar, I now think I am taking poison. But I still pick it up. I am taking less, I need to work on it. You need to work on less sugar. White bread, that wonderful pasta, white pasta, forget it. Try to get away from it. I don't touch white pasta. I have been able to swear of that. (inaudible ) anything sweet, very dangerous. They will shorten your Telomeres. What can we do? Again, we are back to TLCs, exercise, diet, mindfulness, cognitive appraisal. "Viewed mindfully and no situation is chronic." And that means that the nuns led a positive life. Medicine and big pharma are teaching us, "Don't be mindful. Take a pill, go ahead." Corporations say, "Eat sugar. Just enjoy the moment, and let's not think about what's going to happen later on." 

00:11:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Exercise can stop 30% of cancer and diet is next. It is also important in stopping diabetes and preventing Alzheimer's. This is what James Watson, joint discover of DNA, told us when we luckily had 20 minutes alone with him. And there's a picture of us here. We are at this Harvard Club, and we just happened to see him there sitting by himself when we finished reading his book about the Double Helix. And so we went over to talk with him. And I was, I was really surprised to hear what he was doing. I was expecting him to talk about DNA, and he went on to start talking about cancer, the research that he had been doing for the last 10 years. And we asked him, "What did you discover about cancer?" And what he said was, the importance of exercise is what he stressed. And at over 80, he still plays tennis everyday. Exercise, I am going to go on and talk about this some more, is central to stress management and brain heath. It's as effective as medications and therapy for mild to moderate depression. Increases the blood flow to the brain, the immune functions, strengthens the bones and lowers cholesterol. Reduces the cancer risk 30%, reduces high blood pressure 50%, reduces sick days 25% to 50%. Reduces Alzheimer's risk 40% and reduces colon cancer 60%, reduces stroke 27%. And those are pretty important statistics is really make you get off your butt and start exercising. Won't you think? Prevent excessive stress. TLCs are about preventing excessive stress. We'd like to talk about the big seven of mental and physical health. First is exercise, which I've talked about, which we have elaborated on already, but diet and nutrition are next. Sufficient sleep again and again has been found essential for cognitive and emotional balance. And there is now solid evidence that Omega-3s are a solid preventive agent. Fish oil has been found useful in the prevention and treatment of schizophrenia. Meditation also increases grey matter and already has been a standard treatment in cognitive behavioral therapy. Counseling and therapy are important in facilitating social relationships and connections with others. We need to encourage our clients to find cognitive challenges and new things for them to do. Learning and instrument, playing bridge, computer challenges such as Luminosity are examples. Cultural health is a new edition to this list, and we'll elaborate on this later. 

00:14:25
ALLEN IVEY Cultural health, this maybe a surprise, is a way to prevent Alzheimer's, a way to build health. But it means thinking differently about ourselves. I am arguing now that an "I, I, I" focus, individualistic focus is unhealthy and we need to start to thinking about ourselves in relationship and what we can do for others. Cultural health also depends on relationship with family, friends, community, region and nation. It means pride in one's culture and cultural identity. It means, for example, that the pride as an African-American, pride as a Latino… Latina, pride as an Asian, a native American-Indian are really critical in health. Finding pride in oneself builds mental health, which also builds physical health. Now we have this issue of whiteness, something that white people really tend to refused to deal with. An easy way to deal with whiteness to say… as I would say, I am a Celtic American, but that doesn't deal with my white privilege, my opportunity I have. It also doesn't lead me to acceptance of others. If I am… pride of my Italian heritage, I may start thinking that's better than somebody else's heritage. Whiteness brings, in America, actually throughout Europe, throughout the world, a special sense of privilege. We need to be proud of our ethnic culture is, being a Celtic American doesn't make me… uh, doesn't really relate and recognize my own whiteness, which gives me a certain sense of entitlement and privilege. Real cultural health is being proud of my Celtic heritage, or your Italian, et cetera, your African-American, but also needs to be acceptance and tolerance and support for difference. But don't make pride in yourself, cultural pride, on the step… by stepping on others. Cultural health only really occurs if you look at yourself in relationship. And we are back to the "I, I, I" relationship or the person in relationship. Think cultural health. Full mental health requires cultural health. A life vision needs to be touched with a positive culture that respects all rather than goes for inequality. We need confidence for self and for others. There is also, in cultural health, a need for social action and working with those who are less privilege than we are. We need to think about these as counselors and therapists. In the interview, how healthy is the person's cultural self? You are what you eat. And this goes back to Victor Landler in my childhood, and you are what you eat. Food is a critical mental health issue. The more the Mary and I read, the more we become aware of the importance of cultural health. I have already confessed to myself as a sugar addict, and that's something I need very much to work on. When I have sugar, I actually… and inflaming my body, inflammation, is a critical issue, which we are not… We don't talk about counseling or psychotherapy, about inflammation, but diet is a particular, heavy cause of inflammation and problems in the gut. Uh, it leads to increase susceptibility of stress, and it's just a central issue we must really make much more important in our lives. Now, low income leads to psychological stress, it also leads to poor diet. There is not enough money, you'll end up having coke for breakfast, you will end up having white pasta, you will end up all too often eating white bread. That'll lead to obesity. Obesity is higher among the poor. Increases the chance for diabetes, increases the chance for cancer, stress can lead to cancer, and of course, unless used to the therapeutic lifestyle changes. You are also 53% more likely to die earlier because of SAD. What is SAD? SAD is Standard American Die. Standard American Diet is sad, supported by corporations, lobbyists, heavy funding, the media and so forth. If you stay with the SAD diet, the chances of dying earlier are increased. Now, what should you eat? First of all, you better enjoy it or it's all a mess anyway. But the ones what the research says are the most effective is vegan, vegetarian, low fat, Mediterranean and Paleo. Paleo, of course, is a limited use of meat, and ideally grass-fed, rather than this type of stuff with fat in it. You really want to have wild-caught, it's fish you want wild-caught, pescetarians have some evidence now, a study I read recently, where they also tend to live healthier and longer. Fish, particularly salmon, are particularly useful, wild-caught salmon, not farm, is useful. If you're stuck with the farm, you're probably still better off having (inaudible ). And usually, their idea is in terms of the meats, cigarette sized package, keep it small, and treat it as a addition rather than a central issue. But vegetables, vegetables, vegetables and fruit. Dairy is now not necessarily considered so good. Dairy allergies cause inflammation, and if you go back historically through evolution, there is some evidence, increasingly evidence, that dairy is not necessarily a wise choice. Allergies to dairy can cause inflammation as well, so… And watch out for thyroid issues, 'cause and you're often getting hormones in the milk which is non GMO, which has been genetically modified to antibiotics. Again, whites are dangerous. I have said it many times. Sugar, pasta, bread, watch out for the whites. Now, our gut microbiome can rule our food choices. Up on the right, you see a little chart connecting brain with the gut, all those little microbes in the gut. And those gut microbes send signals via the vagus nerve on the right to goad people eating. Actually, research is now suggesting, this is early still, but I think it's promising, that what we eat may not be determined by the head by what the demand in the stomach. You think about that, uh, those little gut microbes that sit there fighting. The good microbes are fighting the bad microbes, and (inaudible ) "Give me more sugar, give me more (inaudible ), give me more white bread." The good microbes are saying, "Give me more yogurt." All of the stuff that you prob… many of you don't want to eat or touch. And by the way, they hijack the nervous system. Prevotella grows best on carbs. Prevotella are the bad bacteria types. Dietary fiber helps Bifidobacteria. You can imagine Prevotella and Bifidobacteria fighting it out in your gut. And sometimes you can even feel that in your gut. Now the microbiome also acts on our moods, effects our psychology and behavior. The gut secretes neurotransmitters, especially serotonin, and hormones as well as toxins. In fact, there is more serotonin coming out of the gut then there is out of the brain. So the microbiome, our gut is very important. If the gut is that important, the best route to the gut is through the food we eat. Of course, the attitudes we have, the brain affects that, but we've got to start recognizing that the gut is very important in our health, and really… diet is a real critical TLC. Diet changes are very important. Interestingly, some research has shown that the gut microbiome can change as quickly as three days if you change your eating pattern. You may think about that sometimes that you have been distressed there, for eating too much and so forth. If you move back to normal diet, your gut settles down and you continue till the next time you go off the wagon and then eat too much of the wrong thing. Prebiotics, which is basically fiber to keep the gut moving. Probiotics, yogurt. I'd recommend that you search out probiotics and also consider probiotics. Again, I am not a physician, check that out. But the probiotics are really critical. They are in all the health stores. And the one that kind of startles people is this fecal transplants. So why do fecal transplant? Well, that's where they take the feces from a healthy person and then insert them in the rectum or the gut of an unhealthy person. What actually happens is the bacteria actually move into the other person and turns out to be very effective medical treatment. They can change the gut microbiome in 24 hours. A fascinating new style of treatment is looking more and more at the gut microbiome. So in affect, in counseling and psychotherapy, looking at diet, you are not a nutritionist, but encouraging your clients to look at diet is really important. Back to cultural health, loud and proud about one's cultural heritage. Aware of family strengths. Positives in one's school, community, nation. Look at things in a positive frame of reference. We are also talking positive psychology here. Then able to work through change in the world, and then that critical tolerant and respectful of differences. Cultural health, because that leads to a lot of other things happening in the TLCs. 

00:24:10
MARY BRADFORD IVEY TLCs promote brain and body health. And I think we are going to go back and forth in this, Allen. Let's look at life purpose and meaning. 

00:24:15
ALLEN IVEY Increasingly, there is evidence that people have a vision, a purpose, live longer, more effectively and a healthier and more grey matter, finding out what you want to do, particularly helping others is really critical in terms of finding life satisfaction, rather than what can I get, what can I get. What can I do to help somebody else? A lot of satisfaction comes from helping others. Social justice action. 

00:24:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And we're also learning about spirituality, the importance of spirituality in promoting brain and, and body health. And certainly, going into operations, it's very important to have people either praying for you or thinking positive thoughts preceding an operation. It's shown to be… person will recover much faster. 

00:25:05
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, I'm thinking a study that was done first at Dartmouth–Hitchcock in New Hampshire, and they found that people who'd had a spiritual, religious orientation got out of the hospital more quickly than those who did not have spiritual orientation. In the other hand, I think a person who has a strong believe or sense in terms… strong sense of meaning, can accomplish must the same even if they are not religious. You can be spiritual if you are not necessarily religious. 

00:25:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I think that being optimistic helps promote brain and body health also, as well as taking nature breaks. If you have a lot of work to do, it's best to take a break and get outside in the green, and smell the fresh air. And just have some quite time. This also helps in promoting brain and body health. 

00:25:55
ALLEN IVEY And the research behind this Seligman found just a little six points, six-point scale on optimism could predict stroke. A person who thinks positively, Seligman of positive psychology, finds that an optimistic, positive attitude toward life is helpful. And of course, things like we are talking about here in these five or six are all ready very much part of the counseling process. We just want to stress their importance. The nature break, that comes from Japanese research. They found that students who go out and walk in the green areas, trees, garden, et cetera, actually performed better in exams. Rather than studying in the last minute, get out and take a nature break. 

00:26:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY And we are assuming you are hearing a lot about controlling the media use these days, you know. It really… For your better body health… I mean, if sitting is not great and, you know, for your eyes strain, we really want to keep our brain and our body healthy and not has spend so much time on devices and media. 

00:26:55
ALLEN IVEY Screen time is dangerous… 

00:26:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY It is too much. 

00:27:00
ALLEN IVEY Dangerous to the health, it involves sitting and it certainly goes against exercise, goes against socialization. And we have a wonderful, but very sad picture. We took our family down for a big event in Baltimore, and we're by the monument to great-grandfather. I have a picture of all six kids standing there looking at screen, looking at the phones, and I said to them say… 

00:27:25
MARY BRADFORD IVEY I think that was the adults, not the kids… 

00:27:30
ALLEN IVEY That was adults? 

00:27:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY That was the adults, yeah. 

00:27:30
ALLEN IVEY And the thing is screen time, phones ain't good. I ain't going to get you off of them. I can only just tell you it is not a good thing to do. 

00:27:40
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Controlling it, controlling it. 

00:27:40
ALLEN IVEY I mean, where is my phone? It's dead right now, so I am pretty safe at the moment. 

00:27:45
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Good. And we have certainly heard enough in the media about avoiding drugs and smoking. We know that that's not good for your body or for your brain. And we want to be very careful with the meds that we take, make sure we are taking exactly what we need, and certainly, to include more vitamin D and Omega-3, CoQ10, those are very, very important vitamins to be taken. 

00:28:05
ALLEN IVEY Yeah, again, we are not physicians, but D3 is now virtually a must for the physicians. We worked, particularly as you age because that's the sunshine vitamin, and we don't get enough sunshine. D3 makes a big difference, and check it out if you think, have think you have any issues there. Omega-3, fish oil… Well, I think we have already said, used for treatment of schizophrenia, increasingly being used as part of a junk… Omega-3 isn't going to cure anything. On the other hand, it's going to build that health we need. CoQ10 has been used now with Returning Vets, the research in that is not as extensive, but I think something that you're needed to think about as well. But again, we are not physicians. 

00:28:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY No, and you need to consult your physicians about using these. But we've certainly used them and have found them very successful. Of course, education is very important. I think we have to just keep on learning and keep on doing all the time to promote our brain and body health, just keep on learning. 

00:29:05
ALLEN IVEY And life is a challenge, as we can say, we had electrical fire and flood and… 

00:29:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY But you got to, you got to keep your sense of humor. 

00:29:15
ALLEN IVEY You got to keep your sense of humor. 

00:29:15
MARY BRADFORD IVEY You got to keep your sense of humor. 

00:29:20
ALLEN IVEY Life is not perfect. 

00:29:20
MARY BRADFORD IVEY No, life… Stuff happens all the time. 

00:29:20
ALLEN IVEY Life, they said, pursuit of happiness and then sometimes is pursuit of not having problems. But let's face it, life is full of problems. If we don't laugh about them, we are going to a real problems. 

00:29:30
MARY BRADFORD IVEY That's right, that's right. 

00:29:35
ALLEN IVEY Research on meditation. 

00:29:35
MARY BRADFORD IVEY Yes, meditation is more effective than meds in preventing relapse in depressed clients. It has shown improvement in immune functioning and improvement in perception and attention, and has an impact on ageing process. We also have increase in gray matter and hippocampus size, and in the chromosomes, there is an increase in telomeres activity. Both of us tried to meditate, I tried… I have a tape that I listen to, uh, Jon Kabat-Zinn. I have ones that are 10 minutes, 15 minutes, half hour, 20 minutes. So whenever I have a little bit of time, I try to meditate each day and I find it certainly very, very helpful. And the research is showing how helpful this is. 

00:30:15
ALLEN IVEY This next one is very special to Mary and me because we've worked in communication stills for a long time. Communication microskills are like attending behavior, reflection of feeling. Listening, basically, rogerian(ph) conditions, listening skills, attending behavior, effect of fun. This Japanese research, this just came out this year. Ventral striatum is activated, that's where we get abstract reward for active listening. A warm glow for receiving positives, listening actually activates the ventral striatum. It will activate the right anterior insular, emotional appraisal, that's where emotional appraisal, present emotions and predicted emotions occur. The medial PFC, it was a more cognitive prefrontal and superior temporal sulcus, metalizing, understanding emotional communication, emotional regulation. So listening improves the functioning of the brain, activates the brain, and a very important part of therapeutic life changes. When in doubt, listen. Dean Ornish puts it all together. he is a well-known diet person. He focuses on a low-fat vegetarian diet, less than 10% of the calories from fat. People argue with his research, his research because they say he also includes moderate aerobic exercise 180 minutes a week, one hour stress management each day and a weekly group support. So isn't just the diet, it's also the lifestyle changes that Ornish encourages. Very good diet is critical. But I think what's critical here is note that he profiled 22,000 genes. We're now in the issue where genes are being used in medical research. We know that examining the genes connecting with cancer leads to more effective targeted cancer treatment. Now we are beginning to find out that counseling, lifestyle changes affect genes as well. And here's his measurements. He found that 143 genes of these 22,000 he looked at changed their expression. Along with the change in expression came an improvement in cardiovascular risk, weight, hypertension and cholesterol. Now, those gene changes are really important, why, because they help support the weight changes, support the changes in hypertension and support the changes in cholesterol. So in effect, counseling changes the brain, therapeutic lifestyle changes the brain, and we can do an immense lot with our bodies and minds to make our lives fuller and better, last longer, and all important to those are aging and perhaps to those who are a bit younger, prevent Alzheimer's. 

00:32:55
MARY BRADFORD IVEY As we conclude, what does this mean for you? So we'd like to have you now umm… pause here, we'd like you to get into groups of three or four and we'd like to have you think about what one thing from TLCs for stress management are you willing to try. This is a time to commit to action. You know, will you add any of this to your life? You've had a chance to look at the instrument, we've had a chance to listen to this. And then to not only change your own life, but will you add the TLCs to counseling and therapy practice? 

00:33:25
ALLEN IVEY And just in case you don't have the handout, here is the handout again. I can't imagine you can read unless you write it in the front of the room. But you can go through them or review them and we'll be glad to send it to you. If you want… This is the second page of the handouts. And if you want them, just email me, allenivey@gmail.com, allenivey@gmail.com. 

00:33:50
MARY BRADFORD IVEY So thank you all today. We've enjoyed presenting TLCs to you. We hope it makes a difference in your life. It certainly has made a difference in our life and, and umm… 

00:34:00
ALLEN IVEY It gives us something to talk about. Doesn't it, Mary? 

00:34:05
