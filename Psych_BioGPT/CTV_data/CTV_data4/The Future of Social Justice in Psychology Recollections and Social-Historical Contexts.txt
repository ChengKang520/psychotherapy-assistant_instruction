MARIE MIVILLE And I would like to introduce Bertha Holliday. Currently Bertha Holliday is PhD in Associates, but of course previously for many years the incredible driving force and director of the Office of Ethnic Minority Affairs at APA, at the American Psychological Association. Bertha… Dr. Holliday is this year's recipient of the Social Justice Action Award. She's a community psychologist educated in the public schools of Kansas City, Missouri, and at the University of Chicago, Harvard University and the University of Texas at Austin. She also engaged in postdoctoral studies at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Cornell University, and served as a SRCD congressional fellow with the U.S. Senate Democratic Policy Committee. Her career as a researcher, teacher, evaluator, and administrator has involved varied sectors including academia, government and the nonprofit sector. She recently retired from the American Psychological Association where she served for 16 years as Senior Director of Ethnic Minority Affairs, and in this role she staffed APA’s Commission on Ethnic Minority Recruitment, Retention and Training in Psychology and its CEMRRAT Grants Fund, and organized and staffed APA’s delegation to the 2001 UN World Conference against Racism, in Durban, South Africa. The final report from that resulted in four APA resolutions policies related to racism, antisemitism, religious tolerance, prejudice, stereotypes and discrimination. As a Senior Director, Bertha also fostered the establishment of the Council of National Psychological Associations for the Advancement of Ethnic Minority Interests; secured $4 million in federal grants to support the APA/NIGMS project, which over a 14-year period provided intensive biomedical research mentorship and support services to more than 650 students of color at 14 different institutions. She secured more than a million dollars in federal contracts for efforts related to school violence prevention, ethnic minority training, and integration of primary care and mental health services; and of course she edits… has edited the semi-annual OEMA Communiqué news journal. Bertha is the author of more than 65 published articles, book chapters and technical reports on such topics as African-American family and child socialization, research instrument development, school mental health, cultural competence in and effectiveness of mental health services and systems, and the history of ethnic minority psychology. She actively participates in numerous psychological and community organizations and recently secured grant funding for a civic association’s conduct of leadership summits and conflict resolution, mediation in her gentrifying neighborhood in Washington DC. Bertha is the recipient of numerous awards from psychological and community organizations. Her hobbies include cooking, gardening, collecting African-American art, and reading. She recently established The Bertha G. Holliday, PhD & Associates, because sadly she retired from OEMA at the… at the American Psychological Association and now she is in an independent consulting firm specializing in program evaluation, strategic planning, and diversity implementation and associations in non-profit institutions and organizations. And so we are very pleased to present Dr. Bertha Holliday with the… for the 8th Annual Social Justice Action award address. Dr. Holliday.

BERTHA G. HOLLIDAY Well, thank you very, very much Marie as you read all of that I… I got tired, because every one of those activities was a struggle and I think that is what is important to know about social justice work and that is why if you want to do it, you gotto love it, 'cos it is… it is very tiring. I'm gonna talk on this subject, but before doing so I did want to thank the roundtable for inviting me. I just shared with Marie that I really have enjoyed this conference and in particular I have enjoyed the intimacy of the conference, because I think it really is important that we have spaces where we can really feel a bit vulnerable, really voice our concerns and really do so in the circle of elders and others who really care for you and they're not a lot of spaces like that in psychology. And I hope you will fight like hell to keep this going, 'cos we need those kinds of spaces. So thank you very much Marie Miville and also her student assistants. Yeah, Jorja I wanna get the whole name right, wait just a minute. Elizabeth Hernandez and Jorja Redway, they've been very helpful and I hope that you've learned a lot out of this experience, that has been a great professional development experience for you. Thank you. What I'm gonna talk about today is the future of social justice in psychology, recollections and social-historical contexts. So this is gonna have a little fact and a whole lot of my opinion. That’s… That’s a nice way of saying that. But before glancing into my little talk, I did want to share with you this resource since the conference is on, you know, indigenous voices. This is the last communiqué that I added to this director of the office of ethnic minority affairs and it is on indigenous psychologists, psychological well-being and healing relative to indigenous people. And we really… When we started putting this issue together, it's… it's… it's interesting. We really didn’t quite know exactly what… what… what was going to be the point of the issue. You know, what… what points we wanted to make. So we just put out a call and I think we got something like about 18 papers in response, which we were shocked, that they were that many papers that people volunteered to write, to put in this online non-peer review journal, you know, which is basically a waste of your time in academic circles. But the point is people had something to say and they wanted to get it out. They felt it was important. And the… the contents of this, I think is… is very interesting and I hope all of you will check it out if you're interested in the whole indigenous psychology issue. It talks not only about American-Indians, it talks about (inaudible ). It talks about people in Guam. You know, I think it talks about… about 10 or 12 different types of indigenous people. But yet you will see there are certain communalities among all of these people, all of them have experienced oppression. They've all been deeply wounded by that oppression and they have all viewed spirituality as a primary instrument for… for healing. So you can just go and Google OEMA and it will pop up Ethnic Minority Affairs, you click on that and when you get on the homepage you'll see a picture just like this when you click on it and you're into the communiqué. So I hope you'll take advantage of that. Okay, the future of social justice. Let me begin with a disclaimer and a sharing of a little bit of myself so that, you know, I think this is always important, 'cos I think it's important that people understand your biases, 'cos you bring bias. So I always like to make sure people understand my bias so there is no misunderstanding, okay?

BERTHA G. HOLLIDAY I'd like to talk… What I'm going to talk about are the issues that the intersection of race ethnicity, diversity, and social justice. For these are issues that have shaped my personal and professional lives. I was born into a racially segregated world in Kansas City, Missouri. I was delivered into the world by black physician in a black hospital. My pre-college education occurred in schools that were either de jure or de facto segregated, where I was taught the skills of the three hours and a broader love of learning by teachers who were mostly black. I was taught values, ethics, and morals at the feet of my parents, at the feet of kin, at the feet of family friends, and by persons at my black church. I went on my first picket line when I was four years old protesting my kindergarten, which was located in a black dance studio as all the negro schools in town were overcrowded and so they had to put us in a dance studio. My childhood was marked by my brother and I accompanying my parents to an unending parade of political and community meetings targeted at desegregating the city's public accommodations, labor structures and increasing blacks local political power. I believe the adults who inhabited my childhood were good, thoughtful, wise, extraordinary and they were worthy of voice. I am among the first generation of those African-Americans who came into childhood after Brown versus Topeka Board of Education and the subsequent Civil Rights era that it benchmarked. Thus, I was among the first generation who were beneficiaries of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and who as I've referred to in a 1986 article that I wrote on African-Americans and social change African-American families and social change, gained access to new, this is a quote, this is my scholarly writing, "gain access to new, enriched social experiences and entry into new settings", from which they had been previously excluded. In that article, I further noted that in this type of situation, African-American individuals and communities are confronted with the predicament of developing, "a workable definition", of the new situation that can guide actions and can facilitate coming to terms with the demands inherent in the new, expanded range of options. I further noted in the paper that learning theory would suggest that under such circumstances, under circumstances where you are a new entry to a setting that you've never been in before with its own peculiar demands that you were kind of forced to engage in trial and error behavior and hence the outcomes were gonna be uneven, you know, the rats in the base(ph) before they learn the maze, trial and error behavior, uneven outcomes. But what I failed to note in that 1986 article, because at that time I did not fully appreciate its import and significance is that the traditional participants and occupants of those, "in rich social experiences and new settings", for them this too was an equally new historical situation in which they too were not only confronted with the same predicaments as the new entrance but they also, like the new entrance, lacked the same prior individual and historical experience for coming to terms with that situation and those demands. Their lives also had been constructed by social structures and practices of the pre-civil rights era. But, their positions, relative to privilege and power, allowed these realities of their inadequacies and their vulnerabilities to be rarely, formerly acknowledged. In fact, the transformation of African-American communities had rippling affects in white communities, where public accommodations such as restrooms, restaurants, hotels, institutions, schools, hospitals, economic systems, witnessed significant economic savings, increased efficiency and greater civility as the result of the Civil Rights era. Indeed, one may postulate that today's major southern urban hubs of economic activity such as Atlanta, Durham, Raleigh, Nashville, Miami, would not have come to be except for the transformation of the Civil Rights Era. We know these things, know that more inclusive social structures and reallocations and transformations of power and privilege result in the significant benefits to all. And yet, we do not know this and certainly we have not sufficiently learned from that knowledge. In this regard, Allison Davis, who was an anthropologist, the first African-American to ever gain a permanent position at a major predominantly white university and also a lover of social learning and psychoanalytic theory made the following statement in his 1983 book entitled Leadership, Love and Aggression. Due to the pass seven, and I may correct that to say now a nine decades of war our ethics and morality with regard to human violence has become schizophrenic. Our values and our sense of reality are split right down the middle. Our right hand neither knows nor wants to know what our left hand is doing. Others such as Davidson and Proudford had more simply noted that most attempts to effect change that would substantially promote diversity and inclusion are undermined by what they call cycles of resistance that are enacted by dominance that these persons would power and privilege in a given setting who also act with the collusion of subordinates in that setting. These observations lead one to conclude that diversity, as a social justice strategy, is profoundly dialectical and transformational. And the work of facilitating social justice is excruciating in its complexity, in its difficulty and in its toll. Now, what has been the history of psychology's involvement in social justice history? During its early years, psychology claimed to have no interest in social justice, instead it viewed itself as a positivist discipline when in fact was not influenced by value. But the great depression of the 1930's, the massive human misery at occasioned and the extraordinary political wheel and social and financial resources that would be required to address the misery, provoked a sector of psychologists who acknowledge the need for a scientific methodology as well as an ideological and value framework that could enable psychologists to understand the effects of socioeconomic factors on human behavior. These psychologists created a schism within the discipline that was punctuated by the establishment of the Psychologist League in New York City in 1934 and the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues in 1936. The former, that is the Psychologists League, was committed to both direct action and social political and ideological critique of issues having implications for psychology, while of the SPSSI focused more on research of social issues including a strong focus on issues of prejudice and stereotyping. The establishment of these organizations also marked the initiation of psychological interest in social justice issues. So we've only be involved in this whole thing of social justice issues for, what, 70 years about aiding. It also should be noted that African-American psychologists have always evidenced a fairly consistent interest in social justice issues especially in this sphere of education and there's a whole story about that but I don’t have time to tell that story. Later, a few SPSSI members such as Otto Klienberg were significant contributors to Gunnar Myrdal's, 1944 Landmark two volume book entitled "An American Dilemma" and this book was significant relative to race relations in the U.S., because it really turned the scholarly and national discussion of racism on its head Gunnar Myrdal who was a Swedish sociologist, declared that racism or the big-row problem as he called it, was fundamentally a white man's problem requiring developmental intervention on those social and institutional practices that white men had created. Kleinberg, Kenneth Clark and other SPSSI members, were later instrumental in formulating the psychological framework for Brown versus Topeka Board of Education. And that brief of course, you know, significantly influenced the outcome of that claim. More information on psychology's involvement in the Brown case can be found in the 50th commemorative anniversary issues that were issued in 2004 by the journal Social Issues and also by the American psychologists. The Brown decision marked the beginning of the Civil Rights era, which lasted for about 25 years, involved various social and legal challenges for securing the protections of the U.S. constitution's 14th and 15th amendments and for eliminating various racially discriminated but legally sanctioned social practices. According to Richards, whose a historian of psychology, organized psychology is represented by the APA was, "politically paralyzed by the sheer breath of its members interests and political attitudes. Thus any general statement about U.S. psychology and the Civil Rights Movement was impossible." So basically throughout the, you know, Civil Rights era or most of the Civil Rights era APA was totally silent regarding anything about Civil Rights. Outside of the paralyzed politics of organized psychology, however, psychologists concerned for issues of social justice dramatically increased as a result of problems associated with school integration, problems associated with, you know, enacting the Civil Rights Act or implementing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other social controversies of the era. And these social controversies ranged from anything… from things such as how do you enhance black children school achievement to how do affect nuclear disarmament. And these were the range of issues that psychologists are… were, you know, involved in. By 1973, sufficient activity on social justice had emerged within psychology to enable the establishment of APA's board of social and ethical responsibility. However, later that board was disbanded but it was pretty good. Also during the 1970's, psychological research increasingly addressed issues related to black children's school achievement and psychologists of color raised the anti on these issues by increasingly challenging research findings and associated policy outcomes that were rooted in the promulgation of deficit perspectives of children and families of color. In 1975, in response to APA's ambivalence towards racial ethnic issues, especially those bearing upon families and children, the independent psychological associations had been established by the nation's four major racial ethnic groups, that is The Association of Black Psychologists, the Asian American Psychological Association, The Society for Indian Psychologists and the National Latino… Latino Psychological Association. By the 1980's, these challenges had evolved into distinctly, culturally centered and ethno-centric theories and research approaches which are at the core of the then emerging area of multi-cultural psychology. Since the 1980's, psychology's interest and involvement in social justice as both in area of research and advocacy has steadily increased and major indicators of this include continuation and increased innovation related to experimental research on prejudice and stereotypes, it's indicated by the emergence of distinct lines of research on such topics as racism, white privilege, micro-aggressions also on topics related to sexual preference, gender identity, gay rights, also we've got a whole lot of research that’s been developed related to ableism(ph) and of course the whole multi-cultural diversity line of research. These are all relatively new lines of research that have emerged in the last 20 or 30 years. Engagement in social action and advocacy related to such issues, engagement in social action and advocacy as supposed to research is evident in such areas as affirmative action in racism, torture, gay rights, mental health disparities, immigration. So this is sort of where we are. Now, what is the future of social justice in psychology? Do I know what it is? It is… If you don’t succeed try, try, try again. And the most dangerous strategy is to jump a… a… a chasm in two leaps. Okay! And I really kind of chose these quotes, because I think they really kind of convey that fundamentally the future of social justice in psychology is going to be a function of persistence and urgency, you know. And that we really have to kind of adapt stances of persistence and recognize the urgency and I think there is a tremendous urgency to do something about a whole lot of things. Mitchell Fine, in commenting on the narratives of leaders and participants of the Civil Rights Act in a American psychologist article, concludes that despite the tremendous sacrifices made by African-American communities in support of educational opportunity, school integration and social justice in the school that has envisioned is initially envisioned by Brown versus Topeka Board of Education, over time that that vision has evidenced what she called a shrinkage. And instead of really kind of opening up all of these new patterns of social interactions, this new type of power sharing among racial groups etc. etc., the whole policy activity related to Brown versus Board of Education in… in the Mitchell Fine's words shrunk to some technical issues related to "squeezing bodies into buses, buildings, and classrooms." Such shrinkage envision in part is due to… in my opinion to the fact that the Brown relied almost exclusively on a legal framework. And legal frameworks are exceptionally rule-driven and are conceptually they're highly restrictive. I mean, you know, there's not a lot of room for play, 'cos the language of love is so precise. Legal concepts and remedies are not especially user-friendly to issues of behavioral and organizational process. I think this is one of the real challenges that we're going to confront in the future related to social justice as how to in a sense get beyond a legal framework of thinking and how to keep our focus on those issues of power and privilege that we all know are at the root of social justice imbalances. As an alternative and as a way of trying to get us to that point, I believe that the growing area of what I'm calling diversity, holds great promise as a vehicle for psychologists' involvement in social justice issues. Diversity is an overarching concept that can be applied to many emerging social justice issues. It is a concept that moves one closer to addressing structural barriers and issues including the imbalance of power and privilege that are at the root of most social justice issues. Unfortunately, the concept of diversity is often used as a catchall term to mask certain aspects of social justice issues rather than illuminating and clarifying. So in a sense, the use of the term diversity in itself tends to undercut diversity in many cases. For example, diversity is sometimes used to refer to the collection of all underrepresented, disenfranchised, oppressed groups. Such use often leads to proposals for equity among these groups such that no action can be taken on behalf of one of these groups that does not have fairly equal benefits for all of the groups. Now, when you frame an issue like that, what happens? Well, what typically happens is that such proposals result in no substantive action being taken for anyone. Diversity also is often used in a manner that confounds it with multiculturalism. In such instances, the emphasis tends to be on the recognition of differences and on associated appropriateness and effectiveness of interpersonal behavior and group interactions and attitudes among differing social groups with much less attention being paid to the power dynamics of a larger social world. Indeed, I believe that diversity could be conceptualized as both an aspirational state of social change as well as a strategy for achieving social justice. Even more important for purposes of application, concepts of diversity are embedded in social spaces. For example, organizations and the institutions and the corporations, where people act to achieve some goal, consequently the impact of diversity efforts are accessible and they're measurable. According to (inaudible ) and others, diversity efforts focus on the creation of inclusive cultures in which social groups who historically were excluded are currently underrepresented or marginalized where these groups experience empowerment. The preferred manner for such inclusion under a diversity model is pluralistic and this contrast to acculturation model that is often invoked in the name of affirmative action. A pluralistic model seeks recognition, valuing and use of different voices, perspectives, talents and contributions. It seeks to bring those differences into a broadened center of organizational opportunities, decision making and power. And it seeks to, once having done that not to use the broadened voices, the… the transformed power, the purpose of that is not to be used to fix people. The purpose is to transform and enrich the functioning and the effectiveness of systems in the direction of greater social justice. This systems focus tends to differentiate diversity from multiculturalism, which tends to be focused more on the interpersonal in the small group level. The inclusive environment sought by diversity strategies like those sought by affirmative action models, seek to ensure the presence of equitable representation of underrepresented and marginal… marginalized groups. But additionally, diversity seeks the empowerment of these persons by the organization's leadership, by the organization's missions, visions, goals, policies and procedures. In his famous letter from Birmingham Jail, Martin Luther King wrote of the distinction between negative and positive peace. A negative peace is one in which the oppressed passively accept their unjust plight. A positive peace is one in which the dignity and worth of all are respected through the establishment of cultures of inclusion, diversity seeks a positive peace. Diversity also seeks an expanded boundaries of what are called acceptable behaviors. And the point of expanding the boundaries of what's acceptable, you know, how you can dress, how you can look, how you can walk, how you're gonna talk, is… by doing so you're more likely to make the differences among people manifest, okay, as supposed to trying to seek an acculturation where everybody's trying to looking and acting and speaking the same way. And so, by making these differences manifest, you are able to open up the space for conversations about differences, 'cos they're manifest, they're obvious, okay. And people have to be more insightful relative to their own differences as well as others. Diversity also seeks new ways of thinking and responding to challenges. And this basically is… is rooted in this whole notion of having more voices in the decision making, and the idea is that the organization gets to a point where it recognizes it cannot make good decisions if it does not have diverse perspectives, 'cos otherwise it is missing too much information and it will again and again and again make the wrong decision and have to go back again and again and try to fix the wrong decisions, without, of course, ever acknowledging it was a wrong decision in the first place. Okay? The other thing that diversity seeks is transparency in communication. Quite often, you know, these organizations are marked by, you know, a top guy, okay, and so of a command and controlled leadership, okay. And you get only the information that someone thinks you need, which typically is always less than you really need. You really need more information. But, I mean, that’s part of what goes with the command and control, 'cos you don’t get all the information you need, so that therefore, you know, you are dependant upon the judgment of those who have more information and so they tell you. Okay, so what you want to do is you want to make the information more transparent and especially in terms of efforts that you're making relative to diversity that, you know, one of the problems with diversity when you're try to implement it is people resist it, and people resist it, because they don’t understand it, they don’t get it, they don’t like it or they don’t like the person whose telling them about it, okay. And the answer to all of those is more information and consistency, transparency and consistency of communication. And, you know, asking people constantly for feedback and kind of, you know, refining things in response to that feedback that you get. Diversity also involves a redistribution and transformation of power. As I said in these kind of hierarchical type of organizational systems you are typically looking at what people have called power over or domination. This is power to dominate and control others. And it is the type of power that you see in top down organizations. What we seek to do in a socially just world is move from power over to power to and power from. Power to is the power that undergoes the freedom to act and the freedom to take reasonable risk without fear of ostracism or retaliation. That’s the power to. The power from, is the power to enable one to resist the demands of others and to in essence function in a way that you aren’t constantly feeling vulnerable. A good example of the power from is a quote I have here, if I can find it, from… here it is, from Kings letter from Birmingham Jail and he's talking about his allies, okay, and this is how he talks about them. "Some noble souls from the ranks of organized religion have broken loose from paralyzing chains of conformity and joined us as active partners in the strength… in the struggle for freedom. They have left their secure congregations and walked the streets. They have gone through the highways of the south. They've been kicked out of their churches. They have lost support of their bishops. But they have done so with the faith that right defeated is stronger than evil triumphant." That is the power from. So in a sense that’s the type of transformation we're seeking. And then the… the final notion is that if we can address these types of diversity goals at the bottom line where we will end up with is it enhances individual and organizational performance. Okay? Bottom-line diversity is great and is… is a positive benefit to everyone. I'm just gonna kind of run through these slides, 'cos I'd like to leave a little time for your questions, but here you have some of the major components of diversity efforts, that is what do people do or seeking to try to make organizations more socially just and more diverse. And I must say that the main thing, you know, in terms of time wise is engaging in gauging(ph) people, engaging people who are resisting diversity and there is a whole body of literature related to diversity resistance which I would encourage you to read. These are some of the diversity resisted behaviors. What's interesting about these behaviors is the first one, two, three, four, five behaviors. Are behaviors… Diversity resisted behaviors of the dominance in a given situation. The next four behaviors are diversity resistance behaviors of subordinates, of the people that you're trying to freak. And they have a very interesting discussion in terms of how these two sets of behavior really exist in collusion with these other to kind of end up effectively resisting diversity. This is a book in terms of the whole notion of diversity resistance. If you haven’t read it, you should read it. It's you know, just an excellent book. And I think probably one of the, you know, the best statements in terms of diversity resistance. So, in closing, let me just simply say that, you know… I'm a proponent for this notion of diversity, because first of all we've got the building blocks we as psychologists have a lot of the building blocks for diversity. For example we… we have already the whole notion of multicultural training, community psychology, the ethnic psychologies. We have the ground-breaking works of some of our she heroes such as Helms, (inaudible ). We have the building blocks of… of some of our classic works in psychology such as Allport, Pettigrew, (inaudible ) and the Clarks. All of these I think are research statements that are served as building blocks for approaches to diversity. Hopefully, we can use these and other building blocks to build within psychology a significant focus on diversity and its use as a major tool for social justice. For I am convinced that the future of local communities of this nation are at risk of implosion from their inherent conflicts and contradictions. Between those with privilege and power and those without somehow we must find a way to significantly reduce the violence that individuals and organizations experience in the absence of social justice. We must more fully recognize that dysfunctional systems are inefficient systems that contribute nothing to our national competitiveness. We must find a way out of the darkness of our not knowing and not wanting to know. Thank you.

00:47:50
As you reflect on your history of social justice activity embattles is that one particularly that stands out as particularly challenging, yeah particularly rewarding in the outcome. 

00:48:05
BERTHA G. HOLLIDAY Now, see this is a very political question. Let me say that one of the things that was very rewarding was the delegation, the establishment of the delegation to the UN World Conference against Racism. Now, this whole thing I think is a very good example of poor communication and people being unwilling to hear the full narratives, both their full narratives and the delegation's full narratives. And I think eventually closure was effective once those narratives came out. But we went to the World Conference on racism to talk about race. While there, one of the things that really impressed me was their model for decision making and it was genuinely a consensus model, the… the model at the NGO… at the NGO level and even at the governmental level, in terms of conferences, is one where they will work over a document literally for years and they will work that document over literally paragraph by paragraph. And they will say, "is there anyone who objects to this language?" And people raise their hands, "I object", "I object", you know. And the convener will say, "okay, you people get together and you're leader will be", and he will appoint a leader, "and you all talk about it for two or three days and come back here and see if you have more something else." And they will go through this again and again and again and as the… as the, you know, the time deadline approaches, then the convener becomes a bit more strict. And then you reach the bottom line where, if there is still opposition to the language of a specific paragraph the convener will say, "you either have to agree or you will lose all the language forever." Okay, which means that, you know, people have to decide whether they feel so strongly in opposition or whatever that they're willing to lose all of the language forever. And you know, people make a decision under those kinds of circumstances. We are sent there to inject the notion of mental health into consideration of racism and again the UN like the US uses a very legal framework, a human rights framework, but that’s still a very legal framework in terms of how they frame racism. And what we did is we spent the bulk of our time going around to all of these caucuses talking about the impact of psychology on issues of racism and talking about the dynamics, the psychological dynamics between oppressor and those being oppressed. And every time we did this, every caucus, no matter what the caucus was, and caucuses are, you know, special interest groups, they have a special, you know, issue they wanna press before the UN. The response was always, "oh", "of course", you know. "We'll take your language and we'll integrate it into your report", into their report, you know. And this… And then we went to the, I don’t know how much people know about the UN, but you know you have the NGOs structure and then you have the governmental structure and they're kind of parallel structures. Then we went to the governmental structure and we did the same thing. We would go in there, Corann Okorodudu is an master at this, so she would take us in there, people know Corann, Corann is a very stately and regal person. You know, she sweeps (inaudible ) and she sits down. I mean, you would think she was the head of the UN, you know. And she, you know, goes and talks to these diplomats just like she's a diplomat. She doesn’t misrepresent herself, but they kind of think she's a diplomat. And, you know, she says, "you know, you need to put this language in. Would this hunch you if you put this language in there?" They look at Corann and they kind of like Corann and that’s how we got the language in there. So we got language in there that really officially recognized the kind of psychological component of… of… of racism and also language in there in terms of things that the UN should do to address this psychological (inaudible ) racism. And we came back and we got in trouble, because we ran into a sort of the whole politics related to Israel and Palestine. And the thing was that the whole conference should be in a sense discredited because of that Israel-Palestine issue. Basically what we did is we just let the thing cool for two or three years. And then two or three years later we brought forth our final report thinking may be it had cooled, well it hadn’t, it just reared itself up. But this time, APA was more willing to deal with it. And Sandy Shuman(ph) did I think a very masterful job of getting the… the delegates and the opponents to the report together. And the thing that was worked out were these four policy statements regarding racism, antisemitism, religious tolerance, and discrimination. So, that I thought was a very positive outcome. But, it was something like a four-year journey to get us to that point.
