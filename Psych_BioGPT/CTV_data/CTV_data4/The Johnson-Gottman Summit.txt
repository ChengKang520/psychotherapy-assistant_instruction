"EFG in Action" with Sue Johnson 

00:00:05
SUE JOHNSON You say it's an incredibly powerful phase, you say, I get upset because I am hearing what -- I am hearing a message that you help me here, I am hearing a message that I am disappointing her. Is that it, am I getting it right? 

00:00:20
MATT That's right. I am disappointing her, yes. 

00:00:20
SUE JOHNSON Okay. So I am hearing that I am disappointing her and then the thought that comes in is but I am doing the best I can. I am doing the best I can and somehow what -- somehow I am dealing with so much here when you turn and tell me that I am disappointing you, I am dealing with so much here, some part of me just wants to go off into my cave, some part of me says I am dealing with so much, I just don't know how to turn and actually tune into you and give you what you want. Am I getting it, you help me on that. 

00:01:05
MATT You are getting it. The term dealing with it may not describe it. It's more like I don't really understand it myself. I am a fixer. I can fix a lot of things. I know how to deal with a lot of problems, but this -- I don't understand why I don't want to have intimacy with my wife or I don't understand why my sex drive is super low and that turns into me as I can't fix it. I don't understand what's going on here. So I am just going to retreat to my cave or get angry and flip it on to her, just flip it on to her and say, okay, I am just going to be angry about this and blat, I am going to pick on you then. 

00:01:50
SUE JOHNSON Okay. So help me here guys, all right. This is good stuff, all right. What you are telling me is the dance you get caught at is you feel like you are never sure you are really important. You are hungry for more connection with your partner, right. And this tension between the two of you, you both are worried about getting into these fights. You say something to him, you get angry that spills out of you, you hear that she is disappointed, right and you are in this confused state where you don't really understand what's going on but your instinct is that you are trying the best you can, it's somehow, my sense is this is overwhelming somehow, you don't really understand what's going on and some part of your brain says there is only one -- I don't know how to fix this. There is only one way out of this. What I am going to do is, I would just want to go off into my cave, we talked about compartmentalizing is a real skill you learned in the military, right. 

00:02:50
MATT Yeah. 

00:02:50
SUE JOHNSON That saved your life a thousand times in the military. 

00:02:50
MATT Yes. 

00:02:55
SUE JOHNSON That ability to compartmentalize, right. 

00:02:55
MATT Yeah, yes. 

00:02:55
SUE JOHNSON Okay. It's natural that that's the place you go, you say, I am going to shut down and move away and go into my cave, tricky part but that one is of course when you do that she is going to feel shut out, right, or you say the other way of dealing with it when I hear that I am disappointing is the other way of doing it is to fight, is to say, no you are wrong. 

00:03:20
MATT Yeah, flip it. 

00:03:20
SUE JOHNSON You are wrong. I am going to flip it. You are wrong. 

00:03:25
RIA And not me, it's you. 

00:03:25
SUE JOHNSON It's not me, it's you. So we have a fight about who it is, right. 

00:03:30
MATT Yes, right. 

00:03:30
SUE JOHNSON Who is the bad guy here. 

00:03:30
SUE JOHNSON Okay. In fact there is really no bad guys, you are both caught in this dreadful dance and you are both hurting. So you flip it and I just want to stay with the dance for a minute and then I want to come back and talk about your feelings because you are saying I don't understand them. So if you flip in, so if he withdraws or flips into anger which is the only way he knows how to deal with that message from you that he is disappointing you what do you do, what is the next step in the dance, what do you do then? 

00:04:00
RIA Well, the last couple of times he got a little ugly, got a little physical and that kind of scared me so a couple of nights ago when we got into it and I just tried to stop, I tried -- I said I don't want to -- I don't want to do this, I am not going to get into this. I am going to go to bed and he pursued me and came looking to like keep getting into it, to keep getting into this fight. So it depends on what the situation is. Sometimes I feel like my points are very valid. I am going to. 

00:04:35
SUE JOHNSON So hang on with me, hang on with me. Sometimes you help me, I am hearing, sometimes you will stand and fight because you really want to be heard. You don't want to be. 

00:04:40
RIA Yes, because I don't believe it, I don't believe that you can actually sit down there and tell me that this is the problem and that I did this and this and this and this and all the while all this over here is not going on, there is nothing here that is filling up any good part of me. And you are going to actually criticize this part of me. 

00:05:00
SUE JOHNSON Right. So you are saying I am standing here all by myself needing your reassurance that you love me and now you turn and criticize me, I can't bear it, and I want you to hear that I can't bear it. So you will stand and fight, right, but now you are saying actually, Sue, now sometimes I am getting really scared that it might even get into a physical fight, so I am starting to withdraw. 

00:05:20
RIA Because it is not going to get anywhere, that's what I am realizing it, it is not getting anywhere, Matt has his opinions, I have my opinions, I know what I feel is right. I am sure he has what he thinks is right or maybe doesn't, but I just can't win. I cannot get that point across. There is no you know what, Ria, I am sorry you feel that way or I don't know what to tell you, but I love you. There is no defusing statement. It's always about me. 

00:05:50
SUE JOHNSON Yeah, right. And so you end up feeling so hurt and you feel hopeless and there is no way out so you started to shut down and withdraw too, right. 

00:05:55
RIA Yeah, and I don't -- and not that way. I don't do that. That's not my way. I like to face things. I like to get it out. I am a fixer also. 

00:06:05
SUE JOHNSON Can you hear where Ria goes with this, that she goes with that sense of hopelessness that she can't reach you, all right, and so she moves away. What's it like for you she starts to move away? 

00:06:20
MATT I don't think she moves away. She doesn't move away, it just crescendos, it just escalates, it just escalates. It's not that I am not seeing what's inside her. 

00:06:25
SUE JOHNSON Okay. I guess what I am saying is how does it end up guys, do you just decide to just get too exhausted to fight, how does it end up, this dance, do you just somehow somebody gets tired and falls asleep or somebody walks away or how do you breaks this. 

00:06:40
RIA The other day he ripped the sheets of the bed and took them into the other extra room and won't let me get other sheets and that's how ended. 

00:06:50
MATT We just retreat. 

00:06:50
SUE JOHNSON You retreat. You both retreat. You have the clash of the titans, everyone feels hopeless, I am presuming you feel hopeless in that moment too, do you? 

00:07:00
MATT Yeah, totally. 

00:07:00
SUE JOHNSON Okay. So both of you feel hopeless, right, you are caught up in a sort of dreadful firefight, right, trying to prove well, it's your fault, I am not the wrong, and then there is a retreat and then what there is sort of pause and then it all starts up again. 

00:07:15
RIA And then we go to work, we get up in the morning and Matt had to go to work and I went to work and our daughter needs to get ready and we just did our things. 

00:07:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Now next piece, hang on. 

00:07:30
MATT I don't know how to come back to you and say afterwards this is -- if I knew how to do that then I would do that. If I knew how to do that I would do that. 

00:07:40
RIA Well, you start to do that better. Both of us, I mean. 

00:07:40
MATT Used to is exactly the problem. 

00:07:45
SUE JOHNSON You guys are going to be -- again, I want you to hear what he said, Ria, because what he said, Ria, are you with me. I want you to really taste what he said. He said it's not that I don't love you Ria or that you are hard to love, it's that in that moment when I am overwhelmed I just -- I don't use the word -- that’s not my word, Mat, maybe paralyze is not the right word, I am just so caught with landing the helicopter, I am so panicked that was my word too. You help me if I am -- I am just on such emergency mode that I am caught in that and I just don't know what to do in that moment. I am caught, I am paralyzed. 

00:08:35
RIA It feels like that. I am sorry. 

00:08:40
MATT We call it an immediate action item in the helicopter, we were so ingrained and trained that you just switch to that immediate action item. It doesn't take conscious thought, it just happens. 

00:08:55
SUE JOHNSON I hear you. 

00:09:00
MATT The twist grip back on, you know, restart the engine, make sure the gear is down. 

00:09:05
SUE JOHNSON I hear you. And I just want to say something here, okay, I am going to change mode slightly, please forgive me. I hear you. I want to say to you is every vet that I have ever worked with is that I hear you and the way I understand that is for you to survive in those situations, you trained your brain, you trained your brain and that's an incredibly beautiful phrase, immediate action item. You trained your brain to respond to emergency and danger in a particular way and unfortunately, Matt, when you come home stateside, you can't just turn that off, yeah. 

00:09:45
MATT Yeah. 

00:09:45
SUE JOHNSON That's right. You can't just turn that off. So when this lady, when you hear that this lady is disappointed in you and you say, oh, my god we are going to get into that war, that clash of the titans again and I don't know how to fix it and maybe I am going to lose the only real co-pilot I have ever had, you know that's danger, and your brain goes into immediate action item. And there is only two things, land the dammed helicopter and go into the cave or fight like hell and you are in action mode. So then she turns and says, how come you tell me you love and it’s like she is talking about being at the bottom of the mountain. You are fighting for your life on the top. You are at a whole different place. 

00:10:30
MATT Yeah, yeah, totally. 

00:10:35
SUE JOHNSON And you don't know how to do it. But the irony is actually it's dangerous because she matters so much to you, if she didn't matter to you, you wouldn't be trying to -- you wouldn't be in immediate action item, would you? 

00:10:45
MATT Right. 

00:10:45
SUE JOHNSON I hear you. So you get stuck in a panic, my goodness this man can't respond to me right now, maybe he really doesn't love me, maybe I am even hard to love, maybe he doesn’t love me, he is so shut down, right, and you get angry, right and try and reach him, you hear, she is disappointed in you, you go into shutting down or fighting back. What's happening for you here is that you are overwhelmed with all this, you are overwhelmed and you go into immediate action item and that is usually emotional shut down. And if I am in emotional shut down, then you say to me, hey, Sue, can you find your feelings of love with me, I am like, no, I am dancing a wall, sorry I don't know how to shift to polka. I am, a what, busy landing the helicopter. You are in fight or freeze, yes. That's what is happening for you? 

00:11:50
MATT Yeah. 

00:11:50
SUE JOHNSON But what I am hearing is, right here, right now when we are talking about this and I am helping you put it together you can turn to your lady and say you know what Ria I do love you and I don't want to lose my co-pilot. I am just caught in this dreadful place by the time we get to this place, would you say, how come you just can't reach for me, I am caught in an immediate action item, I am overwhelmed and I don’t know what to do. 

00:12:20
MATT But I think Ria believes in this place. I think she thinks it's an excuse. 

00:12:25
SUE JOHNSON Okay. Hang on. Let’s just stay here for a minute, because we covered a lot of ground. I want to be here and I got it right? 

00:12:30
SUE JOHNSON Yeah, spot on for me. 

00:12:35
SUE JOHNSON So can you tell her because it's different coming from me, can you tell her, Ria, I hear that you need that reassurance but in that moment I am caught in an immediate action item and I don't know what to do, I am overwhelmed. Can you tell her that? 

00:12:50
MATT I hear that you need me, but I am caught in this cycle that I can't break out of. I don't know what to do. I used to know what to do for us and with us but it's different now, it's just -- 

00:13:10
SUE JOHNSON I am overwhelmed. 

00:13:10
MATT I am overwhelmed that it's not just us, it's everything in my life and I am overwhelmed and I don't know what to do. 

00:13:20
SUE JOHNSON And I am so scared in that moment that I am going to lose you, that's the bit I think maybe as important. 

00:13:25
MATT Yeah, I am scared I am going to lose you. It's not just because another divorce, it's because of our relationship, I love you and we have done a tremendous amount of things together, but can't I not know. 

00:13:40
SUE JOHNSON Okay. So that was a difficult couple in lots of ways, but what he is talking about is I am helping him talk about the battle that goes on inside of him and how consuming it is and how he is experiencing danger everywhere and she becomes a danger cue as well. And when you get caught up in that huge task of affect regulation, you literally have a very hard time looking across and relating to your partner. My friend Jim Cone puts it literally. He says, you just don't have enough glucose go into your brain to do both. And I don't know if that's true, but I like it, okay, so I am telling. So what I am doing is helping him talk explicitly about all the stuff that's going inside him how is struggling to regulate his emotion and it's because he loves her so much, he is so scared to lose her, right. And I am helping her hear that. What I want you to understand is these are highly escalated trauma couples, what I want you to know is they were very hard work and they did just fine in EFT. But part of the difficulty is just like a regular couple every time he shuts down to deal with his emotions, he shuts her out and when he shuts her out he creates panic in her and then they are just off to the races. So this is me working a little bit, you have seen a little bit of what I do, I am working very hard. One of the reasons I am speaking so much is because if I stop for a minute her anxiety comes in like a tidal wave and takes over the session, okay. And I would like you to notice too that sometimes I have to touch her to calm her down. I touched her a lot in this video to keep her with me because if you listen to her voice and see what she does with her hand, she is massively agitated. So this is a brief thing. So I am just going to flip very quickly in a rather strange way to a YouTube clip that gives you a feel for what the opposite of what you have just seen, what we want to create in our couples and especially in our trauma couples. This is a beautiful YouTube clip, okay.

SUE JOHNSON I love that and basically what it does so clever because it uses a basic resonance with attachment to teach us a lesson but what we are really talking to survivors about is that, yes, other people can be dangerous but the bottom line is the only real seatbelt we ever have is the love of other people. So that's what we are trying to help them move into and reach for and experience in EFT when we are working with trauma survivors. Thanks you.

00:18:30
JULIE GOTTMAN Another hand for Sue Johnson. Okay, so you need to go to the next presentation. Here we go. So let's talk about trauma a little bit. I started as an individual therapist about 35 years ago and the first work that I did was working with Vietnam vets, Vietnam vets on the homeless streets of Los Angeles who were alcoholic, who were smoking tons of weed, who were taking heroin and those people were in so much agony, they were in so much pain. I really began to understand at that time the dilemma of trauma. And then I went to Boston and I worked in the combat zone in Boston which apparently no longer exists, but the combat zone was the poorest area, black Puerto Rican, very poor white people, people who were again severely, severely traumatized and I was working with heroin addicts there. And if you want to see trauma, look at heroin addicts. Look at the people who are killing themselves, who are shooting poison into their veins in order to achieve numbness, such numbness that it's literally killing their brains to achieve numbness. That's where you see lots and lots of trauma. So in that individual work, eventually I went to graduate school and in graduate school I met an incredible woman named Lisa Hirschman and Lisa Hirschman was the graduate student who worked with Judith Herman in the first research on father/daughter incest and I was immediately hooked. And I started to work with Lisa and learned everything that this wonderful mind had to teach me about incest and incest became my specialty in work in about 1980. So I worked with incest survivors individually and in couples and in groups. But I really didn't know what the heck I was doing in terms of relationships, not until I met John Gottman in 1985 and we got married very quickly after that which was not traumatizing. It was really wonderful, though it was a little bit unpredictable, I must say. So at that point I was still working with trauma survivors and I will never forget one person who I have worked with individually and she had had a Nazi commandant for a grandfather who had sneaked out of Germany, had come to the United States in 1955, she was born in 1952 and he lived in the barn on their farm and she was the only child, her mother was severely depressed, her father was alcoholic, was there protection. So sadistically sexually abused her and when she came to see me, she finally with tremendous guilt and shame confessed that she had a ritual that she would do in a semi hypnotic state of attaching iron clips to her nipples and her genitals attaching chains to them and then weighing them down with weights. And as she did that, the pain was excruciating and she would have an orgasm. She told me that she had never ever had successful sex after she married her husband. The thing that was amazing is that she had had incredible sex with him before they married. And I understood from her, she taught me a very important lesson about incest that once a person marries and commits they have crossed the line where the partner has become their family member and as they are family member, the incest is reenacted, the terror begins. And so when I began to see her, her situation was that she was sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag fully clothed, he was sleeping on the bed fully clothed and they only had one bedroom which was why they still slept in that room, but she couldn't be in the same room with him otherwise and when they were gardening they still had to garden at least 50 yards apart from each other. They had a big garden. So one of the things that I understood is that there is nothing more sacred than an individual dealing with their trauma in the presence of their partner. So we invited the partner in, she really wanted that partner to understand her trauma which she had just barely opened herself. He had no idea. And what was so magnificent as Sue was pointing out is that she in confiding was received with beautiful loving warmth. Now one small detail about the situation was that he was very depressed. They hadn't had sex in seven years. He hadn't been able to be within about 8 feet of her. So he was empathetic but he wasn't being listened to either. So what was so important was to elicit eventually from him his response to the way that she had to distance and he had never understood that in light of the trauma. So what became clear as Sue was pointing out to, there is a lot in common that we have is that the trauma was a third party in the relationship. There weren't two people in the room, there were three and the third was the ghost of the trauma that was hovering around them like the specter of death and it would not allow them peace, it would not allow them connection. So she was continually pushing him away. So what we needed to understand was the role of that specter, that ghost in the relationship, the ghost of her grandfather in particular, and to understand that when she looked into the eyes of her husband, it wasn't her grandfather that she was seeing, it was her husband and what was so important was to create ways again dyadically for the two of them when they went home to cope with her terror that as she would shut off into a post-traumatic state he could ground her, he could say to her, I am here, I am your husband, look into my eyes, I am the one who loves you. It was a long path to get there. Part of getting there had to do with, he was six feet four, she was five foot two. When they hugged, guess what happened, where did her face go, what's that looked like, it's fellatio, right. That was part of what happened with grandpa. So we devised ways as they trusted one another, as they talked more with one another that he would sit down on a chair, she would come up behind him and she was able to wrap her arms around him because he was the one who would be vulnerable there and their heads were at the same height that was key. And eventually she could move around to the other side to eventually hug him without fear, but it always had to be the heads were at the same level. And they moved after lots and lots and lots of crying and sharing with one another their pain that the role of this ghost had played in their relationship and had sabotaged their relationship how could they be on the same side against this ghost that kept interfering with the relationship. Eventually they found ways, step by step by step to move into sexuality again where she had to be on top, he couldn't be, her head had to be at the same level as his, his couldn't be higher, so there were many little steps that they took towards achieving beautiful sexual intimacy again. So all of that was possible despite having incest from the age of six to 16. Okay, I am going to show you also a film but let’s talk a little bit about a case that came in through the Anderson Cooper show. How about that? So Krista and Steve, this is Krista and Steve, and Krista and Steve were married for 14 years and John interviewed them on the Anderson Cooper show. Steve was a pediatrician, Krista was a stay at home mom. She wanted to be a celebrity on the Survivor TV show. They both had been married when they met. Krista already had four children. Steve was also married, didn't have any kids, she seduced him. They had sex, she got pregnant and then they decided to divorce their partners, come together, then they had two more children. So now we are talking six kids and he was still working. So Krista's history was one of terrible trauma. Her father had left when she was two. Her moth had a variety of live-in boyfriends including one who was horribly, horribly violent and was violent towards the mother and towards Krista as well for eight years. The mother was also just a -- had a little bit of post trauma herself and would simulate suicide just to get Krista's attention like holding a knife in her hand and covering herself with ketchup falling on the floor and Krista would come into the room and Krista would be like ten years old, right. So Krista was a very traumatized women, very compartmentalized also. Krista had also been bullied as a kid. Steve was one of four sons, high achieving, became a doctor, his parents wanted him to be a doctor, his mother was very emotionally distant from him, very emotionally dismissive fellow himself. And the history of their marriage, as I mentioned, Krista became pregnant, they got together and the presenting problems were these. They had horrible, horrible escalated quarrels. So they were on the Anderson Cooper show. We agreed to see them in what we call marathon therapy which is three days of therapy, five to six hours a day of therapy. So very intensive work where we are moving with lots of momentum through helping this couple to understand one another, to learn how to process conflict differently, to learn about each other's internal worlds so that they could love one another with more honesty, with more openness. Now, a couple of other details. She had had an affair about a year earlier with a carpenter for three weeks. He actually blamed himself for it which was amazing because he had knowledge that he was very distant from her. Also they had lots and lots of problems with the kids too and yes she also drink a little bit, typical of somebody who suffered from trauma, right. So here were some of the conflict areas and there was a lots of criticism, lots of contempt. The first 30 second of their sitting together was pure unadulterated contempt on her part. So here is their treatment and we did assessment interviews, then we really worked on conflict and used some of our conflict interventions to go much more deeply into what was the pain within each of them that was leading them to distance from one another, to attack one another, how could we heal that pain within each person by opening it to the other person. So there is a particular intervention that I am going to show you and it's called the aftermath of a fight. And let me guide you to look at page 43 in your manual. Page 43 in your manual, we really wanted to give you some takeaways here, is what we call the aftermath of a fight and here is what this is. It is a process that is dyadic where the partners are speaking with one another and they are processing a very regrettable incident that occurred in the past and I will tell you about that incident in a moment, but let's look at this. So if you turn to page 44, here is what we guide people to do so that they can do this at home as well as in our office. First, they think about what incident they are wanting to process and you will see a list of feelings, step one, they go over the list of feelings each one, each person and they say which feelings did they have during the course of the regrettable incident. They are talking to one another now. They are not talking to you. So the first thing they are doing is saying what are the feelings that they had during this incident. They are not explaining them quite yet. They are just naming the feelings and oftentimes those feelings are quite a surprise to the other person. The second step is where they tell their own subjective reality of what happened during that particular incident, what was going on for them. And we often encourage people to be sure that they are describing themselves, they are not describing the character of their partner, they are describing themselves. So they are saying things like you came into the room, I saw your face and what I saw was anger, I saw there is anger on your face and I felt frightened and then I decided to turn around, not ask you how your day was because I felt afraid. So here they are explaining why they had the feelings that came up in the first place. Sometimes we combine this with step three which is triggers and in triggers, triggers are did you have any feelings that came up for you during the course of this incident that are a reminiscent of past feelings, feelings that you had long before you came into this relationship and again we gave another list as just suggestions for the kinds of feelings they may have had, things like feeling rejected, feeling excluded, feeling shamed, feeling powerless, feeling out of control, so they are looking at what kinds of other feelings came up during this incident. And one of the things that we really encourage for people who are shut down is to talk about their bodies, what was going on in their body. If they can't name the emotion, what happened in their chests, what happened in their bellies, did their belly feel kicked, did their chest feel tight, did their jaw feel locked, could they give words to that, could they give words to the kick in the belly, I felt kicked in the belly, right. So they are telling each other about old enduring vulnerable feelings also and the story that went with those, how did those feelings get started. That's part of triggers. So one person tells their perception. It's important that the other person hear that, summarize it a bit and say something validating. Validating doesn't mean you agree with that point of view, validating means from your shoes I can see how you felt that way. So we are encouraging people to try to put themselves in their partner's shoes and understand it with more depth. Here we often help out with again that Dan Wile intervention and in the film you are going to see my doing that a bit. This is a long session that we have abbreviated that you are going to see in -- it's 20 minutes here and in life it was about an hour and a half. So it's very abbreviated and they are doing the aftermath of a fight but with a little bit of additional help from me. One thing that I do with a Dan Wile intervention is I will go over and I don't know there is something about heads. So I will kneel down next to the person whose voice I am trying to express so that they don’t feel intimidated by me, they feel respected, they feel honored, they feel looked up to and I am always asking after I have given, I've tried to give voice to what they are feeling, does that make sense, was that right, correct me if I am wrong. So they have an opportunity of course to say their own truth. Then I will ask them to say it themselves in their own words. So you will see that. Let me tell you a little bit about the incident that occurred between Krista and Steve where trauma comes up and trauma is relevant. The incident was that Steve's medical partners wanted him to go to Menninger's clinic and do a workshop for three days because he was doing a lousy job with the mothers of his patients of his kid patients, big surprise, right. So Krista really thought this was a step towards firing him and she was freaked out. So he called to tell her about it from the office, she listened, she was okay, that's interesting, hung up the phone, immediately called her individual therapists, they were from out of state and the therapists said you are right, sounds like he is going to get fired. She panicked, she freaked out, he comes home, and she tries to get him to see that he is going to be fired and he should resist and turn against his partners who he has known for 25 years and not go to the program that they have asked him to go to. The fight escalates from there. So you will see what happens here. The focus on PTSD again is heightening the awareness of both partners on the role PTSD is playing in their horrible escalated incredible quarrel where she ends up throwing his stuff out on the grass. It's to help both of them understand and stand together on the other side of the fence from the PTSD that is drowning one of them. And that's part of what I do when I try to add in that what we call that Dan Wile intervention. So very important to deepen the awareness of what's triggering the PTSD and what it feels like for that person inside them, then to create in the future as we go all the way through in the aftermath of a fight what parts are you responsible for in the fight and making constructive plans for how you can avoid something like this in the future to identify what triggers the PTSD, what sets off all the alarm bells and how can the partner be there for you rather than feeling like your enemy and identifying those ways so that when the PTSD is triggered again as it is it will be forever more, at some point, that partner can be with the other, as a safety. So let's watch the film of these two and again it's edited the aftermath of a fight. Now let's move to step two. Remember it's a speaker/listener. One of you describes kind of factually what happened, what you felt and what you needed. The other person listens and at the end summarizes what you heard and say something validating. 

00:43:55
Krista's Reality 

00:43:55
KRISTA The facts were you called me on the phone that day and I could tell in your voice that something wasn't okay and you told me that you have been worried that there was something going on because there was a meeting and you were involved in it and you were afraid to tell me that maybe something was going on because you weren't sure. And you told me about Kansas and I knew at that moment I had to support you because I had to process my thoughts about it, I didn't know what to think about yet, so the best thing for me to do at that moment is to support you and then have to think about it. So I instantly felt when you told me that unsafe, I felt worried that you were going to lose your job and I was worried that this process was really about them going through all the steps you need to go through to fire a physician from a practice. And I was worried that you didn't see that, I was worried that you were being -- I was worried that and you were in desperate need to be liked and be a part of that practice and you would do anything to keep your job and to make them happy without thinking about the actual situation. So I was worried you were being taken advantage of and I was worried you were being blinded. And I felt hopeless and powerless because you wouldn’t listen to me and everything I said was stupid or wrong and I had talked to other people and gotten advice about the situation before I may -- in the time frame of what have I do in the processing time to get feedback from people, is this normal, what happens et cetera, legally et cetera. So then when you wouldn't listen to me and you started -- you would yell at me and tell me that I wasn't supporting you and I would talk and it become a big fight and I was screaming at you on the phone when you were with your partners and I was letting them know that I knew their plan was to fire you because I wanted them to know and I knew that they would be like, oops, you know, she is. 

00:46:35
JULIE GOTTMAN Sorry, I am a little bit confused and I want to make sure I understand. You were screaming at him on the phone at the partners. 

00:46:45
KRISTA He came home. Yeah, he was on phone with his partners. He came home. 

00:46:45
JULIE GOTTMAN He was on the phone with his partners. 

00:46:50
KRISTA And then his partners called -- he called his partners on the phone and he said, Krista thinks I shouldn’t go, she thinks you are going to fire me and then they are on the phone with him at our house and they are saying if you don’t go you probably going to be fired, you have to go. And I am screaming in the background and he is holding the phone and I am going crazy and screaming and then I was definitely drinking wine. It was like a Friday late afternoon. 

00:47:20
STEVE Right. 

00:47:20
KRISTA And then I went into what I now know was this abandonment trigger where you were leaving and I was freaked out. It was also when I was leading for that survivor phone call and I was panicked about all that I have worked for with survivor being gone because I had nobody to take care of the kids and you -- I thought there was no empathy for the fact that I might have to give that up and I was frustrated that you didn't see my perspective, but I understood why you didn’t. Then I kicked you out of the house. I threw all the stuff out of the closet at you, I threw your computer on the ground, I threw a bunch of your stuff and then you left. And when you left that abandonment trigger went crazy and I wanted you back and you would not return my phone calls, you wouldn't to pick up the phone, your brother wouldn't let you pick up the phone. That may be more mad because I thought I felt like, again, just like with your partners, you were letting somebody else dictate what you should be doing instead of Steve making a decision. So I got really mad and I put the girls in the car at midnight and I went over to your brother's condo and I honked the horn until you would come out because you wouldn't answer the phone. Then the police came by and said hey, how are you, and I was like, fine, and they went by. You started to come out. Then somehow you called my dad, you called my psychologist and everybody thought I was crazy and then my psychologist talked to me and she is like I see that you are fine. You just need Steve to call you, and I am like yes, I just need him to call me. And then you came home and you were afraid to come home without your brother because you were worried I might injure you. This made me so mad I could injure you because, not really, because I thought how dare you think that I would hurt you. I have never hurt you, I have never tried to hurt you. Yes, I had thrown your stuff, yes I had thrown a bread at you or something soft. I have never tried to hurt you and this situation wasn't about that. And so for you to say you felt unsafe coming into the home without a bodyguard was you turning everything around and you bring all this pressured stuff from you being doing a bad job, you getting into trouble at work, you put it on me like I am the bad guy. 

00:49:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Okay, careful, careful, careful. 

00:49:55
KRISTA That was it. 

00:49:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Facts. Facts. 

00:50:00
KRISTA That was the facts. And then he left. 

00:50:05

00:50:10
Julie Adds a Dan Wile 

00:50:10
Intervention for Krista 

00:50:10
JULIE GOTTMAN So when you first called I was like a deer caught in the headlights. I was kind of at a shock. And my first instinct was, okay, just be supportive and then I was. But between that time, when we got off the phone, afterwards I really began to think about it and I began to panic, I began to feel, oh, my god, what is this me, it was terrifying to me and all kinds of awful thoughts went through my head like is he going to get fired. Is this what this means, is he going to lose his job. If he loses his job what's going to happen to us, what's going to happen to our wills, what's going to happen to our house, what's going to happen to our family. So it literally felt like, oh, my god, our survival is at stake here. I felt just terrified and when I get terrified I literally almost feel like I could die. That's how it feels. I feel like I am flying apart into a million pieces. I fragment, I shatter inside and I go flying into a million different pieces inside, that's what happened. Okay, so then I guess I am imagining he went off to stay with his brother or something, is that what happened. 

00:51:50
KRISTA That's it. 

00:51:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Yeah, okay. All right. So then I am beside myself and when I say that what I mean is I am not even in my body, I am so terrified that you know I am not thinking calmly and coolly in that point. 

00:52:15
KRISTA I was not in my body. I was completely -- 

00:52:20
JULIE GOTTMAN I was in -- it's kind of like terror of death really. I mean, that is what it feels like, I don't know if I can explain that, but literally that is what it feels like and I am -- my panic has taken over, my terror has taken over. I don't even know what the hell I am doing and I guess I have been drinking some and that made me think even less coolly and so all I want is to connect with you. At that moment, after you left what happens to me, it is as if all of a sudden -- this is kind of what it feels like, and you correct me if I am wrong, okay. Okay, it is as if I am in outer space and I have been cast out of the ship with no oxygen line and I am floating in outer space starving for air and I am desperately grasping for, oh, god, take me back, take me back, connect with me, you are my lifeline, I am going to die. 

00:53:35
KRISTA Yes. 

00:53:35
JULIE GOTTMAN Without out you. I am going to die without you. I will do anything. 

00:53:40
KRISTA Hundreds of phone calls. You didn't answer. 

00:53:45
JULIE GOTTMAN That's the feeling. I am going to die literally. I am going to die. There is no oxygen. And this, I just want to note something as an aside, this is a feeling that Krista has struggled with her entire life. It's at the core of what took her into the therapy a million years ago at ten. And it's at the core of what she works on in therapy now and it comes from this high, from infancy of literally being no doubt an infant with no connection to what your take is, zero nothing and she is alone and there is no way to survive. It does feel like fear of death, that is exactly what it feels like and that's where she went that night. So then the next day, and so she was out of her mind literally, she is out of her adult state, her more and more adult state and she is regressed to this high, I am flying apart into million pieces, I am going to die. I have got to connect with him so she jumps into the car and she honks and she is doing all the stuff to try and connect with you. Okay, so eventually you know she has -- she is out of control, so you are out of control, I am out of control and the next day, I guess, I am throwing stuff everywhere, I am crazy, I am just crazy. 

00:55:45
KRISTA Crying hysterically. 

00:55:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Crying hysterically, in a way, the way that you felt cast out with my throwing everything on the ground that's exactly how I felt when you walked out. I am kind of unconsciously making you feel what I felt, so what I felt was even worse because, you know, I am like a one-year old with you walking out. So I am getting you to feel what I felt that's what that is. I am worthless, I am worth throwing on the -- that all I am worth is throwing on the floor. That was all that acting out that I did there that I terribly regret because I really lost it. I wasn't my best self by a long shot. That’s what was going on for me. What did you feel? 

00:56:50
STEVE I felt at that point totally alienated by -- we were saying like I felt on that, totally unsupported and misunderstood and that this was something that I had to do and other people's opinions and thoughts really are totally irrelevant to what was going to happen and I felt totally unsupported by you. 

00:57:30
JULIE GOTTMAN How about alone? 

00:57:30
STEVE Alone, I have no options and you didn't -- I didn't get that feeling of support from you. 

00:57:45
JULIE GOTTMAN Were you also feeling kind of ashamed in general about this, in shock a little bit? 

00:57:55
STEVE I was ashamed about the state that I got myself into and how they -- whether advice that they got or the dynamics that occurred which I wasn't ready to and I am sure they have their own thoughts of this is the right way to do this but that wasn't the issue. I was ashamed of what happened. 

00:58:20
JULIE GOTTMAN Okay. So let's stop at here. But here is -- so basically you know what we are doing is we are unpacking the moments, we are unpacking the moments of a regrettable incident processing that regrettable incident and understanding again what was the pain within each individual. In this situation there was a lot that Krista had already told me about her past, a lot that she had said in her assessment, in other pieces of our work together that let me know how very, very, very small she became when she fractured and went into panic that ended up looking like rage but beneath was a real fight for air for survival which was the connection she had with Steve and her terror of losing him. So often in trauma when we are working with trauma it's so true that when the other person hears the reality of where that traumatized individual has gone, even in the phase of what they have received during the regrettable incident, full-on hate, when they later hear the terror, the pain, they are there, they care, they hear it, they want to be there for their partner. They want to understand it. That's why I guess I am a firm believer that one can do individual therapy in a couple's context and with trauma, with PTSD, there is no more beautiful way to help both the individual and the partner cope with that trauma than having the witness, the person who loves that traumatized partner, hearing their pain in the moment, unfolding the story in the moment, knowing really what that trauma is like within them at the deepest level, not just the facts, but the deeper level. So thank you very much. 

01:01:15
[sil.] 

01:01:25
JULIE GOTTMAN So everybody, so here is what we would like to do now. Though many of you were asked to write your question on cards, we also wanted to give you ten minutes of questions just about the trauma work that you have seen Sue do, you have seen us do, ten minutes of those, okay, and what we would like you to do because the acoustics are so incredible here is to stand up and yell, okay, we want you to yell your question so that we can hear and then we will repeat the question and then we will answer those questions for ten minutes, okay. So does anybody have any questions about treating PTSD? 

01:02:20
[sil.] 

01:02:25
SUE JOHNSON That's a good question, an emotionally focused therapy, if you have two people who are traumatized how do you handle it, carefully. The bottom line is if you have two trauma survivors everything is more difficulty because they both go into a tailspin at the same time. So you can do it, we have done it. In fact, some of the folks in the complex PTSD study we ended up they were dual trauma. The bottom line is you have to be able to create amazing safety in the session and you have an alliance where they allow you to structure the session. So if you notice in that tape I was doing, I had my hand on her a lot, actually you didn't see enough of the tape, I had my hand on her a lot, okay. And I am doing a number of things with my hand, I am soothing her, but there is a certain point at which it is almost like I am holding her and holding her to let him come in and start to do new things with her, okay. So if I am working with dual trauma, I have to say to them, you know, we are going to stop right now and I understand how difficult this is for you and I am going to go back here and we are going to -- I hear you and we are going to go back here and we are going to talk about this, but right here, right now I want you to stay with me and I want you to try and listen to your partner because he is going to talk to you about the fact that he really wants to let you in, but it's scary for him. And I think you want to hear that. So right now that's what we are going to do and then we are going to come back to you. So you have to structure and you have to have an alliance and we'll then let you structure it but obviously with dual trauma, it's much more difficult. The fact of the matter is, if you think of it in the abstract, it's almost impossible but the fact of the matter is that when you have a real couple in front of you, who desperately long to have connection, you can do it, but its harder work and you have to go slow. You know we usually do eight to twenty sessions on ETF but when we work to the hospital, we try to come up with an average for trauma couples and it was 30 to 35 and if you've got dual trauma, it's going to longer than that because you've got just more stuff to handle and you have to create a lot of safety in stage one of EFT, de-escalating, you have to create a lot of safe haven secure base with you and between them before you start walking into the dragon layer especially when they've both -- they've both -- they've both got dragons but yes you can do it. You just have to go slow and you have to try take the risks. You have to ask trauma survivors to take little tiny risks instead of doing what I sometime do with regular folks which is say, oh look there is a cliff, off you go. 

01:05:30
JOHN GOTTMAN  Darren? 

01:05:35
DARREN I have a similar 

01:05:45
[sil.] 

01:05:50
DARREN Like six months to a year and I must have had a little -- 

01:05:55
[sil.] 

01:06:05
JULIE GOTTMAN So, did you guys hear that question? 

01:06:10
JOHN GOTTMAN Repeat it. 

01:06:10
JULIE GOTTMAN Let me repeat the question. He noted that he had seen a couple where both people were dying of cancer and during the -- he saw them for one session, they didn't come back after that. Is there something that you can do when you got trauma right off the bat like that. One of my specialties is also was working with cancer patients and their families, so that is a situation that I've seen before and you're right, there is a shift that one has do to right from the beginning. Which is that, both of you are facing death, both of you -- and these are the things that I'll actually just say right off the bat. Both of you are terribly guilty that you're abandoning the other. But -- 

01:07:10
DARREN And their children. 

01:07:10
JULIE GOTTMAN And the children, both of you are terrified of what will happen to your children and the calamity, the catastrophe that has hit you is so profound that you probably haven't been able to talk about it at all, right. Right. So both of you are probably feeling intensely alone, right. Right. So we will open up, you know, we'll have a conversation then about what was it like for you from the very beginning, each of you, tell the other, what was it like to hear the diagnosis. What was it like to hear your partner's diagnosis. What was it like to hear your partner was gonna to die, what did that mean about your remaining time. And one of the things that -- that we love to do in a situation like this, where there is, there is really an existential trauma, I only have so much time. All of us only have so much time, right. But these people know how much time they have, they're guessing at least. So how can you make your life most meaningful with your children, with each other, what can give your lives meaning in this last six months that you have. So we're looking at not only the emotional experience of death, of facing death, of abandoning the children and what that feels like but can you hold one another in your tears that your live is ending, can you hold one another in that process. So how can you enrich every moment, every breadth you're given now with your children and with one another. 

01:09:40
JOHN GOTTMAN  Questions? 

01:09:45
SUE JOHNSON Maybe one more we have time for here. 

01:09:55
[sil.] 

01:10:05
SUE JOHNSON We'll talk about touch, female therapists can use touch with men. My experience is, it depends on you and your comfort. If I'm comfortable with touch, all my life, I grew up in a pub, everybody touched everybody. That sounds a bit bad, okay. But I'm very comfortable with touch, I think it depends on you because it depends on the message you give, I touch men, I touch women but I'm careful, okay, like John and I were talking a bit in -- like often the first time I touch somebody, I'll touch them here. 

01:10:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Right. 

01:10:50
SUE JOHNSON That's light and its -- that's not intrusive, right. And I'll watch somebody's face. So I'm careful. With trauma survivors, I'm more careful because touch can have a double meaning. So you have to be careful and be sensitive to people's cues but yes I touch men, I touch men and I touch women, in fact, I sit close enough in therapy that I can touch both people. I might touch somebody in the outside of their knee because that's what I can touch or I'll just even reach out my hands, sometimes I can't reach them, they get the message, you know and it's like I'm here, I'm here with you, it's a comforting move, it's a holding move, but I think you have to be comfortable with it. I've seen male therapists massively comfortable with touching men and women and doing it beautifully and I've seen male therapists who are very uncomfortable with touching women and they don't and they use their voice instead. You know, if -- you don't have to touch, you can use your voice to hold somebody. 

01:11:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Can I just add something to that. Especially with people who have been sexually abused in childhood or incested. One of the things that I'll always do before I reach out and touch somebody is to ask their permission. 

01:12:10
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

01:12:10
JULIE GOTTMAN So I'll ask them first, so that they have control over the touch. 

01:12:20
SUE JOHNSON Yeah. 

01:12:20
JULIE GOTTMAN So that I'm not inadvertently reenacting something they went through early on. That's the only thing I wanted to add. And now shall we move on I think. 

01:12:30
SUE JOHNSON Sure. 

01:12:30
JULIE GOTTMAN  We are going to be talking now, having a conversation with one another again, which I think you guys kind of enjoyed. Talking about the similarities and the differences between our methods overall. So where shall we begin guys. 

01:12:50
SUE JOHNSON  We could talk about this for about 18 months. So bring you camping and you coffee and -- 

01:13:00
JULIE GOTTMAN Sleeping beds. 

01:13:00
JOHN GOTTMAN So I think, one difference is that, we really measure physiology as couples interact and try to really take a look at the consequences of flooding of physiological flooding and something I've talked to you about in a number of times, you know, just getting, now the technology is so well developed and so cheap that you can get some really reliable and valid pulsometers that are FDA approved, just buy them on Amazon. And even if they don't have an alarm you know couples can tell you what their heart rate is and present oxygen and concentration and then you can see whether they are flooded. In some cases -- I keep thinking this one case I had where the level of physiological arousal of this women was so high and the representing problem was that she wasn't, she didn't feel any sexual desire for her husband and this women you know couldn't feel any desire at all because of that high level of fear that was being manifested in her body. So she really needed anxiolytics to just come down, that needed to be a part of the treatment. And that's what happened when she was referred to a psychiatrist for assessment. 

01:14:25
SUE JOHNSON Yeah, I think you are right. I mean, I don't -- I think I do in different ways. I mean, I think a lot of what I do is, tune into the expression on people's faces and I'll say my senses, your just completely overwhelmed right now, could you help me, what's happening for you, and I'll do it in a different way but you are right that won't occur to me. 

01:14:45
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, yeah, it's right. 

01:14:50
SUE JOHNSON I think I send for that, I send for the little thing to put on your finger and then I lost it, I don't know where it's gone. It's in my office somewhere but you know I do in a different way I think. 

01:15:00
JOHN GOTTMAN When we first started, you know, taking urine samples, we were very uncomfortable and one of my graduate students was a registered nurse you know and she said, you guys are crazy, you are asking people about their sex life and all these intimate. You know, we just -- you know we just say I need your urine sample and say oh okay. So if you feel comfortable, I even say I need a urine sample and -- and once you are comfortable with the procedure, it's useful to know what's going in people's bodies. 

01:15:35
JULIE GOTTMAN Right, right. You know I think one of the similarities between us that I really, really love is again going into that deep internal world where people are terrified, where people feel pain, where they are very, very vulnerable and they are afraid to really speak the truth of what they are experiencing in a moment. 

01:16:00
SUE JOHNSON Yes. 

01:16:00
JULIE GOTTMAN And so we have an intervention called the anatomy of a fight, it's a different one than what you guys saw as well as understanding the internal working model, which of course comes from attachment theory. And in that, we are also exploring with the individuals what's happening within them in terms of their sense of vulnerability versus safety. And also the self criticism that's happening within them that sometimes is agonizing for them and makes them very, very vigilant of everything that's going on including their partner but they're giving it to themselves more than they give to anybody. So you know there is some commonality there that I love but what I love the most about what you do is that you're breaking it down step by step by step and your listing the answer from the partners about their own fears and responses and with EFT methods which is so beautiful, you are helping them to describe what that internal world really looks like and what they are really needing with their partner and you do that so beautifully I love it. 

01:17:25
SUE JOHNSON  Oh, okay. 

01:17:30
JULIE GOTTMAN  Just needed to see. 

01:17:35
SUE JOHNSON I think we have lots of similarities, I mean, we have the same values like valuing you know trust and valuing closeness and intimacy and I think we have the same respect for emotion, right and how powerful negative emotion can be and the impact that couples have on each other, right. So I think there is lots of similarities. You know I sort struggle with thinking okay, you know what are the differences, I think maybe the differences are in how we do it, right. So it's easier for me to actually think about Dan, we both like Dan Will a lot. But it's easier for me to sort of think about him somehow, I fell like we -- we -- we are in the middle of somewhere, you are in the middle of somewhere, when I think about Dan, what I -- when I talk about Dan, I say to him sometimes, Dan it's no good you just interpreting the couple to each other and explaining the couple to each other because it's very nice and -- but it's on -- it's too cognitive because the bottom line is if you're going to -- what we know from -- from pit -- from basic Bolby from basic understanding of anxiety as if you're going to change an emotion, you've got to feel it first. And you've got to feel it in order for you to regulate it differently and you've got in order to put it out to your spouse congruently with your facial message and your voice differently and to taste it yourself and for your partner to taste it. So somehow I want to go in and walk around in a curious way inside somebody's experience and say what -- what to you feel right now, what's happening for you in your chest and we both talk about body too, what's happening for you in your chest and what's words coming out for you right now, can you tell her right now, I am overwhelmed. And then what happens to you when he says he is overwhelmed and I want the person in the overwhelmed, I don't want him talking about the overwhelmed, I want him in the overwhelmed. It's kind of funny, I'll give you an analogy, I use my tango to help me do EFT and my EFT to help me do tango, okay. So, one day I was dancing with my teacher and he says, well you are pretty good now, you know, you are pretty good now, you know all the steps but you're not really dancing. So that really ticked me off, okay. So I said, what do you mean I'm not really dancing. He says, well, you're dancing all the steps in your head and you're trying to predict what I'm going to do. And I said, okay. And he says, now you have let go of that and just feel it because the bottom line is the only way you can really dance is to tune into me, trust your body, go with your emotion and feel it. Don't you know anything about going with emotion, ha ha ha. We have a good relationship, I say to him, I'm going to pop you now, okay. But I say, ha ha ha. But it was very useful for me because I realized that I would get tensed and the tenser I got, I would be in my head predicting him and explaining and thinking about what he was going to do. What I had -- he said, actually the only way you can dance is to feel when I move my chest like that. You have to feel it your body and I think that's what I feel with couples. We actually have to let them feel it so that they -- they start to put it together differently in their body and they start to taste and then they can actually give it as a signal to their partner and it's congruent because their partner can see on their face. And I say to Dan you explain people to each other all the time but in the end, in the pivotal moments when the -- when there is emotional dance going on, it's just an explanation you know like in the end, my husband who is sitting down there smiling at me, he can explain to me why he is angry and I really don't give a damn unless he -- unless he also comes towards me and I see his face move and I see that he wants to be close to me and that is vulnerable like me and then he puts his arms around me. Unless he tells that, it's kind of interesting for him to explain to me his emotion but it doesn't move me into a new step in the dance, yeah. So I think maybe some of the ways we do it are different. I think we've learned over a long periods of years of particular new ones to way of working with emotion. But I think the thing that is different and special about Gottman and EFT is that we respect emotion and honor it and don't just try to go past it or discount or say doesn't matter, just put it aside you know we work with it. We might work with it differently, but we work with it. 

01:23:00
JULIE GOTTMAN That's right. 

01:23:00
JOHN GOTTMAN What about sex? How does -- 

01:23:05
JULIE GOTTMAN But I wanted to so. 

01:23:05
SUE JOHNSON What about sex? 

01:23:05
JULIE GOTTMAN Too late. How can I compete with sex? 

01:23:10
JOHN GOTTMAN  Great sex, I mean. 

01:23:15
JULIE GOTTMAN Can I say something first and we'll go to sex, I promise. 

01:23:15
JOHN GOTTMAN  You always say that. 

01:23:20
JULIE GOTTMAN Don't interpret that the way. I know what you are thinking. Okay, so the -- I wanted to add to also one of the similarities that we have, you're bringing up emotion and what a powerful thing that is. I think also in our two methods differently than many other methods out there, we believe in attachment, we believe in depending on one another. 

01:24:00
SUE JOHNSON Yes. 

01:24:00
JULIE GOTTMAN We believe on -- 

01:24:00
SUE JOHNSON But that's okay good and healthy. 

01:24:05
JULIE GOTTMAN It's good, it's healthy, it's hard wired and it's not that human beings are supposed to be able to stand on their own two feet and never have to lean on each other rather our very survival as you beautifully pointed out this morning depends on being able to reach out to one and other and to have that another be there for us. 

01:24:30
JOHN GOTTMAN And you are not afraid fusion. 

01:24:30
JULIE GOTTMAN So dependence is a good thing, we are not afraid fusion, whatever that is. 

01:24:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Fusion. 

01:24:35
JULIE GOTTMAN Okay, now sex dear. 

01:24:40
JOHN GOTTMAN I'm not in the mood now. 

01:24:45
[sil.] 

01:24:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Wait a minute, that supposed to be my line. 

01:24:55
SUE JOHNSON Okay, sex. 

01:25:00
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, so -- I really don't know what you do when -- when you look at a couple who are really having trouble in the bedroom and of course a lot of that really has to do with emotional connection. 

01:25:15
SUE JOHNSON Yes. 

01:25:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Yes but there is also a part of it that has to do with knowing your partner with the erotic world and you know touch and really knowing how to be with one another. So how does the EFT deal just with romance, passion, the bedroom. 

01:25:35
SUE JOHNSON Well, that's a -- okay, five hours later. But basically what we find is that we listen, we ask do you touch each other, do you hold each other, do you make love and actually I'm much more disturbed when people tell me, no, we don't each other, we don't hug each other than I'm when they say we don't make love, okay. But we ask about that in the cycle in the beginning, we ask about that in the assessment, we ask, we always have an individual session in EFT as part of the assessment, we ask about that, okay. And what we find is, lots of times, the sexual difficulties are just part of all the negative cycle that's going on and you know we are not wired to be sexual aroused when we are enraged or afraid and that's the truth, okay. So we -- we'll talk about that and we'll normalize it and often what we find is, if we do regular EFT, you know and sometimes positions will change, like the man will pursue for sex, where is withdrawn in the rest of the relationship, right. But now the women shuts him down, right. So what we often find is, there is not, the sexual relationship isn't going well, why would it be, they are both of emotional balance, why should they be able to dance together physical and coordinate, why would you expect that, it's a craziness, right. But of course, the fact that they can't make love is also making everything worse, right. So what we find is, if we do regular EFT, an awful lot of the time as they get safe together and they feel safer and they feel more affectionate and more open towards each other, the sex starts to improve and we'll check on that. And the -- we've just done a piece of research that said that in that big attachment study we did, people's sexual side as a fraction did improve as their relationship got better. But that's not true with all couples, some couples come in with very specific sexual issues and some couples come in with sort of like the sex is much more front and center. So what we usually do is, we put it in the cycle, we recognize it, we do EFT, we do basic, de-escalation of the negative cycle, we normalize the sexual responses, we put them in the context of attachment and safety and then when we come down into stage two, when people feel safer and they're more vulnerable, we'll directly address the sexuality and talk about, okay, what happens to you, it happened again last night, you made a very sort of guarded almost proposal to make love and she turned you down flat and then you had this big fight, let's go back into that, let's go back into sexuality and -- so then you'll deliberately address it, sometimes you have attachment injuries around sex. So you go deeper, people feel very vulnerable in that area. So to really go into it, we'll -- we'll usually wait till the second stage where we are restructuring emotional connection and we might do some more in-consolidation, we might say to people in the consolidation time, well tell me how was your sexual story changed, how have you changed it, how do you wanted to be in the future. You know, when I think we've learned from Hold Me Tight, I didn't write Hold Me Tight for therapist to use really, I wrote Hold Me Tight because I couldn't bear the fact that we seem to know so much about attachment and nobody was telling the general public about it, it was just driving me crazy. So I wrote Hold Me Tight for all the people who wouldn’t go for therapy, and then all the therapist starting giving Hold Me Tight to all the clients and telling me, oh yeah, it's much easier if you give Hold Me Tight to the clients, they get involved easier and of course there is a chapter in there in sex. So we say to people, in fact I just told this to my couple actually, I said, this week for your homework I want you to read the sex chapter in Hold Me Tight and I want you to read, I want you to maybe do the first exercise, I can't remember what it is now, okay. I want you read the chapter, and of course what the chapter has in it is lots of couples talking about -- talking about their sex lives and getting stuck. But I think a good point here is that as part of not understanding love and bonding, we have mistaken sex for the whole shebang. And if you take any element out of context and make it bigger, it becomes distraughted and I think we've done some very weird stuff around sex in our society and in our profession like one of the -- one myth that's out there that drives me a little weird is that for familiarity, closeness and secure attachment kills passion. 

01:30:25
JOHN GOTTMAN Sure, right, we agree with that. 

01:30:25
JULIE GOTTMAN I hate that. 

01:30:25
SUE JOHNSON And that is such a naught one. 

01:30:30
JULIE GOTTMAN Yes. 

01:30:30
SUE JOHNSON Because it's the oldest idea in the world and the bottom line is even if you look at the best survey research in your country is by a man called Lawmen from the University of Chicago and what he basically says is, secure -- he doesn't say securely attached, he says, satisfied long-term happy couples have more sex, they have better sex and they enjoy it more and what I tried to talk -- what Bolby said is, attachment is the basic building block of her relationship and it potentiates the other two main aspects which is care giving and sexuality. 

01:31:10
JOHN GOTTMAN Well, you know there is now a five nation study that Pepper Schwartz did called The Normal Bar, which surveys -- surveys people about their sex life and about affection and intimacy and connection and she -- her data completely disprove estaprol contention that you know intimacy and connection means bad sex, it's just not true, they really are all of the same fabric and it's a real good data. 

01:31:40
SUE JOHNSON And if you think about sex as play and if you think about erotism as play, you know, when are you most playful, when you feel safe. And if you also think sex is a huge act of coordination. I mean, if you think about it in the movies act like, nothing in the movies, the movies are completely phony, in the movies, nobody even has to say things like would you move over, I'm falling off the bed, right. I mean, it all just happens, it all just happens right. Well in fact sex is this huge act of coordination and like what I say in Hold Me Tight is all the evidence is actually it's just as likely that practice make perfect. And you know when I go tango, the people who dance the most beautiful tangos, any person will tell you, anywhere in North America, the people who dance the most beautiful tangos are couples who care for each other and who know how to coordinate and move and play together and who experiment because they do feel safe, they experiment with new steps, they know how to follow, they know how to lead, those are the couples that does the tango that makes you want to sit and weep because it's so beautiful. I mean that's thrilling, you know, I mean that's thrilling right, so it's, I think we've done some weird things when we say in order to have passion, you have to be distant and separate and avoidant, I don't know where we get the idea. So I think we're the same in that too. 

01:33:25
JULIE GOTTMAN Movies, movies. You know I also wanted to mention that you know in our culture, we are terrified of talking about sex, nobody will talk about sex. 

01:33:35
SUE JOHNSON  Yes. 

01:33:40
JULIE GOTTMAN Right. Like to say breast, vagina, penis, breasts, nipple breasts, whatever. I focused on breasts. Don't analyze that. So you know -- 

01:33:50
JOHN GOTTMAN  That's something in common. 

01:33:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Okay, this is -- such a rascal, he is a such a rascal. What are you gonna do with a guy like this. So you know what we've also tried to do in our own methods, in got sex kit is we've given people ways to talk to one another about the specifics of sex. What do they want in terms of initiation. What do they want, what would feel like gentle refusal. What kind of positions do they prefer, what are they comfortable with in terms of a erotic touch. So you know they are ways that we really have to help structure right and talk about. 

01:34:45
SUE JOHNSON I think that's right and it's ironic isn't it because we got such a sexuality culture, as long as there is impersonal sex. 

01:34:50
JULIE GOTTMAN Right, exactly. 

01:34:50
SUE JOHNSON But the minute it's personal sex or then I don't want to talk about it right, then it's too difficult. 

01:35:00
JULIE GOTTMAN I don't know, right. That's exactly right. So we tried to give folks also you know both the emotional component of it which really needs to healed first and then actually the practicalities of, okay, so what do you like honey. So just knowing into the specifics of how to talk about it. 

01:35:25
SUE JOHNSON Well, then the issue is also I think, when we talk about sexual problems, if you can face them together, so often they are completely solvable and in Hold Me Tight, I give the example of a couple dealing with the fact that he is just developed erectile dysfunction, and when they come to see us, it all tied up with their negative cycle and it's just making everything worse. By the second stage of EFT, when they can talk about it in a different way and it doesn't have all this abandonment and rejection all tied up in it. They can talk about in different way, we can normalize it and we talk about the fact that you know in a forty minute love session, his penis that we call George for some reason, I don't why. 

01:36:05
JULIE GOTTMAN  Don't take it personally George. 

01:36:10
SUE JOHNSON If there is any Georges but we call his penis, he calls his penis George, and we talk about the fact that occasional George will take a nap. And you see if the couple facing together is no big deal, if he says things like shut up John. He says, oh dear George has taken a nap and she'll say oh it's all right, he will wake up in a minute. And nobody gets upset about it and she says things like, well, how shall I wake George up. And -- but look at how unloaded that is because it doesn't mean you don't love me, it doesn't mean you don't deserve me, it doesn't mean I'm a failure, it doesn't mean, it doesn't mean any of those things. It just means that sex is incredible act of coordination and George has taken a nap right now. And so I think when you come unload all the negative attachment significance of these things, couples can deal with this together and say, I don't actually like it when you put your foot like that in the dance, actually, it would help me a lot, if you would just turn more, right, that's not hard to do when you feel safe and when every negative cue isn't all loaded with this emotional baggage of, my god there you are you see don't desire me, my god there you are you see that -- and that's too hard, right. 

01:37:50
JULIE GOTTMAN That's right. So I think what we are supposed to do now is some Q&A, right. 

01:37:55
SUE JOHNSON Oh, alright, so we can talk some more about similarities and differences tomorrow but whatever, yeah, okay. 

01:38:00
JULIE GOTTMAN  Do you want to keep talking about similarities and differences. 

01:38:05
SUE JOHNSON No, let's go for it, let's do Q&A. 

01:38:05
JULIE GOTTMAN  What is that you need right now? So -- okay. 

01:38:10
SUE JOHNSON  Are you serious, I want a large scotch is what I need right now. 

01:38:15
JULIE GOTTMAN  Who is got it out there. Alright, so you guys wrote down some questions. Well should we -- 

01:38:30
JOHN GOTTMAN Let's turn it up to the audience. 

01:38:30
JULIE GOTTMAN  Well let's do this also. 

01:38:35
SUE JOHNSON Okay -- 

01:38:35
JULIE GOTTMAN Go ahead Sue. 

01:38:35
SUE JOHNSON  So we are going to answer some of these questions that you so kindly wrote down for us on cards. I have one here saying, how do we know that the still face affects adults the same way as it affects infants. Is this an assumption or inference. So that's a very interesting question. Okay, it depends what you mean by no. Of course, a still face isn't going to impact an adult the exact way it impacts an infant because adults are more sophisticated and are less vulnerable, right. So adults have more flexible ways of coping. Adults for example can don't have to touch their attachment figure all the time and look in their attachment figure's face, adults can internalize their attachment figure. So you know if have an imagine that my partner does really love me and does really care for me and that's my internal representation. If they in an argument suddenly go completely still face on me, I'm probably not going to freak out the way that baby did, okay because I've got this internalized attachment but I think what that movie shows is the impact of lack of response. And the fact that most couples have no idea the impact they have on each other on an attachment level and the impact of no response when I shutdown, I shut you out. And we haven't really understood that all at. So I think it's not the same, however, if you say to me, do we know that attachment signals like shutting down and going away from you and shutting you out. Do we know that they impact adults, absolutely we do, it's not an assumption and it's not an inference there is hundreds of study on adult attachment. If you want to read something very challenging, the best book out there is by Mikulincer and Shaver and it's called Attachment in Adulthood 2007 and it's got hundreds of studies talking, looking at adults for example, I will give you one of most seminal ones, in 1990, Jeff Simpson did the first, the very first observational study of adult attachment patterns and what he did was he got couples to come into a lab and he set up, he told them he would go up and say to them and we want the -- we're only going to use the female partner and we're going to invite her into the room over here and you're going to wait outside and by the way we didn't really tell you but actually most people find this experiment incredibly unpleasant. And I'm afraid that we are going to be asking you to do and you have signed the forms, we are going to be asking you do to -- do to something that most people find really, really difficult and unpleasant. Alright so they basically set this person up and they leave. How this got an ethics board I don't know but it did. It won't get through my crazy guys at the University of Ottawa. Anyway, they leave and they film and what they saw was the same three patterns for example that you see in attachment between mothers and infants, you saw that some people incredibly comfortable turning to their partner and saying oh, what do you think he meant that sounds weird, I don't like this and asking for comfort and that some partners were immediately like it's alright, you don't -- I'm sure -- I'm sure it will be fine sweetie and you can -- and then they would comfort each other and they'd calm down and they would talk about something else. So that looks like secure attachment and you'd see other people with much more extremely responses and Jeff said, I really knew that we were onto the same thing when we watched this lady who -- we'd give her an attachment questionnaire and she came out as an avoidant, she doesn't want to trust people, she doesn't like closeness, and what happened was the researcher left and she sits there and she stares at the floor and her partner says, oh that doesn't sound good, are you worried about and she says don't talk to me. And he says, are you alright, I mean, you're not worried are you. Are you alright and he reaches over to touch her and she says, don't touch me, I'm just fine, okay, I'm just fine, there is nothing wrong with me, I can handle it, I'm fine. That's an avoidant attachment. You get -- you get freaked out not all the time, you're perfectly charming at cocktail parties. You get freaked out when you're vulnerable or you're partner vulnerable and you go, no, no, no, no, no. In other words, they found these universal tendencies, these universal responses, separation distress, you can watch at airports, if you want to see adult attachment, go to airports, okay. They've seen these joy at reunions, they've seen all these patterns, they've seen these three ways of dealing with attachment, reaching, shutting down and dismissing and getting highly anxious of saying give more attachment, hold me more, hold me more, they found it in lots of different studies with observational studies, we've -- with the last thing we did -- we did questionnaires, we did observations and tasks talking about differences, we did put people in FMRI machine. So no, it's not assumption or an inference that the same responses and the same patterns of affect regulation and behaviors are in adults and infants. There is an amazing of scientific data on the -- and level and it's growing all the time. 

01:44:30
JOHN GOTTMAN And you can take newly wedded a couple of months after the wedding and put them in apartment lab and the ones how are going to divorce six years from now, turn towards bids 33% of the time and ones who stay married six years from now have turn toward bids 86% of the time. It hurts when you make a bid for connection and your partner turns away. 

01:44:55
JULIE GOTTMAN Yeah, that's one of the things that we work on directly. I'm going to move onto another question. So this one is about the dreams within conflict intervention. The question, what would be your ideal dream, this person wanted to hear more about it. Do couples find this difficult, this concept of an ideal dream. So in the dream within conflict intervention, what we are doing is we are talking about a particular area of conflict and one person is the speaker and one is the listener, the listener is asking a serious of questions that you have on your -- in your manual. And what would be your ideal dream here refers to in your position on this issue. What would be your ideal dream, what would it look like if you could have it exactly the way you wanted. So let me give an example of the way that this works. In our level one training, we have a couple that shown Paul and Shawntel. And Paul is Samoan, Shawntel is African American. Shawntel comes from the most horrendous abuse in the world. She was incested, she was sexually abused by the friends of her uncle who abused her and watched, both parents were gone, one in jail, one with drug addiction et cetera. So she had simply wanted just to have a few gifts now and then, and he was worried that if they spent a little money on gifts, well they were going to go bankrupt because in fact they had gone bankrupt, okay. So when we gave the dream within conflict intervention, what happened is that as Paul asked Shawntel, okay, so you know what do you want here, what do you believe here, and what she started to talk about is, you know I just want some tangible palpable signs that you love me that you care. I not only want to hear the words but I also really need to hold something in my hand and then she laughed and she said I'm ready for tennis bracelets, you know I'm ready for little diamonds now and then. And he is going watch out. But she then -- the question that was asked that he asked next was well is there some childhood history to this. Noticed that that question precedes the one about the ideal dream. So she began to tell the story of how she had lived with her aunt and uncle, the uncle who abused her. They had a parcel of kids, the kids got Christmas presents from you know the door to the living room, all the way across the room to the tree, she might get a pack of socks, oh, we've got to get her something. She felt so neglected, so worthless for so many reasons that you know nothing was ever given to her except abuse. So she explained this to Paul with much more emotion this time with he'd known the facts but with much more feeling. She explained to him how painful that was, how horrible it felt to be devalued when you knew that those parent figures, whoever they were, uncle and aunt here, cared so little about her that they would make her feel absolutely worthless in the face of what they were giving to their other children. So when it came time to the question about well what would be your ideal dream here, you know no more laughter, she was in touch with her own tremendous deprivation. Her own feelings of worthlessness as she had talked about that history. So her ideal dream to get something more than a pack of socks, to get something that he knew her well enough to understand would have personal meaning for her. And that wasn't just being given ritualistically for Christmas or for a birthday but it was being given precisely because he just loved her and wanted to show her. He wanted to give her something, so it didn't really matter to her what she received, she just wanted to hold in her hand something tangible that he had given her that he knew her well enough to know she would love and that represented his love for her. That's what an ideal dream looks like and every single partner we've ever seen would dream within conflicts they get it, right away, there is no problem with getting it. 

01:50:35
JOHN GOTTMAN  You have a question? 

01:50:40
SUE JOHNSON Yeah, there is a lots of good questions here, I don't know how -- we can go for them. I mean some of them very, very short, you know like, somebody saying, can you apply this to parent and adolescence attachment. Absolutely you can. We do EFT with families and if you look on the isEFT website you will find all kinds of articles and presentations and chapters. If you want to read a transcript of me working with a mother and daughter, there is a transcript and an old article I wrote, I think it's called listening to the music and it was in the journal of systematic therapies and it's a transcript of me working with a mother and daughter, but yes we do the same sort of thing with adolescence and families and actually everybody like working with families. So there is some ones. Can you do attachment oriented screening? If you want to use -- if you look at research, we use something called the experiences and close relationship scale which is -- we use it in research and it's Chris Farley and sometimes we give that in our research and we sometimes give it to people in our clinic but to tell you the truth, usually the way I assess something like attachment is I ask people to tell me, who held you when you cried when you were little, who did you turn to, what is it -- do you know -- can you turn to your partner to be soothed, what was it like for you growing up, you know when did you feel close and safe. And then you watch how people talk to you. How they talk to you is so much more powerful than what they say because you watch their face and you watch their emotion, and you watch how they regulate in the emotion and you know about their attachment and whether they've ever seen anything called secure connection or whether it's foreign territory to them. And if its foreign territory, you just got to help them more and speaking of which, talking about EFT with aspergers. Aspergers is a popular title right now. We have trends you know aspergers is on a spectrum. People come -- with emotion and ability to tolerate their emotion and to name it and to stay with it and process it is on a spectrum. And I think if you're an EFT therapist, the first thing you do is you accept where people are when they come in. And you accept that they have very good reasons for being there and if emotion is a foreign territory for them, then you accept that it's a foreign territory for them and you go slower and you give them more help and you give them a name when they can't find one. You say, could you help me, is it like sadness, is that's what it's like you, what does it feel like and he says, well it hurts in my chest here and I feel like I want to cry. I think is that a sadness, I think is that a sadness. So I think so, what do you think. So I think so, yeah. He say, and when does it come up. He says, well when she looks like that, when she looks. So here is this guy and he is like a little kid walking into a playroom, whose never seen a play set before. So you say, hey this is a play set, you know this is, this is -- and you normalize and you validate and you led a little more than you would but yes you can work with aspergers and in fact there is a very nice tape of one of colleagues who is here, Helander, you're her somewhere, here she if giggling. From Vancouver, a very nice tape of one of colleagues who working with an aspergers' gentleman in The Netherlands, so yes you can do EFT with aspergers. 

01:54:25
JOHN GOTTMAN And Eugene Gendlin's work on focusing is very important thing to look at. 

01:54:30
JULIE GOTTMAN So this is phrased as a Schnarch question with the -- easy, easy. With the Christa and Steve aftermath. Is the intervention nut ultimately helping her to restore the emotional fusion that kept her alive. Relationship of emotional fusion rather than bonding, okay. So I'm going to be, I'm going to try to be very gentle. So there -- I know that a lot of people really embrace Schnarch's work but there is actually no research anywhere that comes anywhere close to even supporting the emotion of emotional fusion, there is no such thing. So basically, this is very -- it's an old, old idea that actually originated, well I know it goes back to Marit Boven, it may go back even further than that which had to do with emotion -- rationality, being very good, people should not lean on one another because that means they are fused and they're not a whole person within themselves. So lots of emphasis was given to being whole within yourself and only then can you have a healthy relationship and what whole means, is really being pretty cut off from your emotions and not needing another person and people could be too needy and jeez, guess what, it was usually women who were too needy right. So that whole field of thought is scientifically invalid, it's wrong, it has no research, in fact, people have attempted to test it. It doesn't exist, the attachment work that Sue has done, that Bowlby did lots of attachment theory is based on research, the work that we've done is based on research and that's probably one of the most beautiful things about the commonality between Sue'e work and our work that we are not making it up in our heads that it's not our personal opinion and conjecture that PS might be related to our own fundamental problems, right. It's based on research, it's based on observing couples and what we've seen in couples is that you know attachment is real, dependency is human, healthy, good and the more bonding the better, there is no such thing as fusion. 

01:57:50
SUE JOHNSON I just want to say something about that. You know attachment is revolutionary in many ways and it's still revolutionary. It changed parenting on this continent, it took about 40 years to do it, but John Bowlby changed parenting and maybe now we're turning and changing intimate loving relationships the same way I hope so because he certainly helped change the culture of parenting but what Bowlby said that is still revolutionary is he said, there is no such thing as true self dependency or true over dependency, there is only effective or ineffective dependency and effective dependency makes you stronger and the research for that is unassailable, the securely attached people are the ones who have a more coherent articulated positive sense of self. Securely feeling, securely attachment young Korea women were more confident and more able to go out into the world, deal with stress and met their career goals faster, why? Because they had, they weren't doing it all alone. They had a secure base called a man who they could -- who would support them. So we have some funny ideas that have pathologized dependency but that lady, an attachment would say, she is a trauma survivor, she got fearful avoidant attachment, she is massively anxious about her attachment and if you can create more secure attachment, she will calm down, be able to regulate her emotion, be able -- and she will be able to use his comfort to build a sense of self, she will be able to learn how to regulate her emotion, and she would be able to become more secure. And that's -- and that's what we see in our research, so some of these ideas are you know this idea that somehow you got to be whole in yourself and that it's immature to need other people its a -- its out of date guys.

JULIE GOTTMAN Let me add something. With Christa and Steve, in terms of that aftermath of flight intervention and which as I mentioned was much longer, you know, the beauty of that was that, Steve really got her agony in terms of his not responding to her phone calls. And she must have called him over a hundred times. So he got it, he understood and at the same time, she deeply understood his pain at hearing contempt about him at hearing the hateful words, she understood it. And it's because, they were able to understand each other that she was able to take responsibility for her part even though many of you might diagnose her as borderline and never able to take in her own responsibility for things, she totally owned responsibility for her part. He owned responsibility for his and then together, they hug, they loved one another, not because the other one accepted blame but because they deeply understood each other's vulnerability, each other's deepest humanity and that's what this is all about. So thank you for today everybody. Thank you.
