Dr. Yalom is the author of many professional texts in addition to popular nonfiction and his newer genre: teaching novels. His books include: Love's Executioner, The Theory and Practice of Group Therapy, Existential Psychotherapy, When Nietzsche Wept, The Schopenhauer Cure, Lying on the Couch, The Gift of Therapy, Momma and the Meaning of Life, Staring at the Sun, and his latest teaching novel, The Spinoza Problem. Dr. Yalom also continues his private practice, with offices in Palo Alto and San Francisco. He believes that a different therapy must be constructed for each patient because each has a unique story. As the years pass, this attitude moves him farther and farther from the center of professional psychiatry, which is now "so fiercely driven by economic forces in precisely opposite directions - namely accurate de-individualizing (symptom-based) diagnosis and uniform, protocol-driven, brief therapy for all."

JEFFREY ZEIG I, I, I can only begin to tell you how personally gratifying that is to hear. And for my staff too, thank you so, so very much. Uh-hmm. Just a few announcements, and, uhm, we-- because Professor Edelman's lecture was not, ah, adequate from an auditory perspective, we are making that available to you. We've sent you a link to get, ah, Professor Edelman's speech. Everybody here has got an email in their inbox with a link to get Professor Edelman's opening keynote. If there's any problem with that, then you email support@erickson-foundation.org and we will take care of it. But you should already have this in your inbox. And, uh-hmm, so please no cell phones now. This would be a great time to tell you to turn your cell phone to silent. And, ah, I think that there will be time for questions, perhaps. We'll, we'll have to see. What, ah, Professor Yalom would like to do is to speak for about an hour, take a five-minute stretch break and then, ah, have the second half of the speech. So if there's time for questions, people will be able to use the microphone. And handouts still available at evolutionofpyschotherapy.com. The handouts, they, ah, change and I know that I'll be adding handouts. I'm sure other faculty will be updating and adding handouts. And then, uhm, for the continuing education procedures, that starts on Monday and it won't take you very much time. You'll be able to read this through. And the quicker you can do this, the better. And even if you don't need a CE certificate, we're very grateful if you still, uhm, go and fill out the form so that we can get your feedback. Your feedback is essential, crucial, important in setting up future conferences in getting the faculty who you want to come to this meeting. And, ah, on, on Monday, Polster and I, we're doing a master class and, uhm, I know some of you will be there. There's still some-- I don't even know if there's any room, I think it's sold out now, ah, for the master class on Monday. It's really a wonderful event. Remember that everything that is being recorded. If you still want copies of the Wizard of the Desert, buying them here you'll have a considerable savings on the cost of the DVD plus the, ah, cost of the postage and handling.

If you, ah, buy, ah, any of the items like the T-shirts and the cards, there's not many cards left, but if you buy an item, you're welcome to take a poster for free if you buy an item tomorrow at the Erickson Foundation, ah, booth. And, ah, we only have a few decks of cards left. The conference audio recordings, there is substantial discount and I've explained at many of the programs that I've taught that it takes me about six months to work my way through all of the recordings and it's a treasure trove of information. Ah, I do have one thing that I left out. Uhm, because, ah, ah, Dr. Ya-- Yalom-- Professor Yalom has asked no flash recording during his presentation, uhm, you know, the division is hard enough on stage, but please not during the presentation, no flash recording. And, ah, if you buy the DVD-ROM of the videos of the workshop, I was just informed that you will have a password and access so that you will also be able to view them online. Now that's only if you buy the DVD-ROM package of the videos from the conference, then you will get a link, ah, and there's a special perk for free, you'll be able to also watch them online, only with the DVD package. And then next year, we, ah, we'll be celebrating the brief therapy conference. It's especially dedicated to working with anxiety, with depression, with trauma. We will be glad to, ah, invite you. If you register before January 10th you'll get the lowest discount for next year's brief therapy conference which will be held here in Anaheim. The Couples Conference not until 2015 and that will also be in Southern California at the Marriott in Manhattan Beach. In the 2015, we also have the Erickson Congress. For those of you who are devotees of Milton Erickson, it's an opportunity to learn from the experts who have developed Ericksonian therapy in, in the last 40 years. And, ah, we have training programs and museum in Phoenix, master class in Phoenix, lots of activities from the Erickson Foundation including our museum, our press. Collected works. If you're interested we have volume 10 of the collected works. That's available now which is a book if not of realities. And, ah, Professor Yalom. You know, there's a, a few people whose contribution to the evolution of psychotherapy conference has been profound. And certainly, ah, Professor Yalom has been one of them, Professor Zelikman, Professor Beck, these are people who are, are highlights at the Evolution of Psychotherapy conference. And Professor Yalom has been a great, great friend of the Erickson Foundation. Ah, an avid contributors of the literature that he has produced. I'm sure it has affected all of you both, ah, in your mind and in your heart. And, ah, his, ah, writing has been peerless about stories of psychotherapy and philosophy, existential work, group therapy. Ah, it's incredible contribution here. You're privileged, you're very lucky to be here tonight, I, I-- and I, ah, guarantee that by the end of the evening you'll, you'll, you'll feel it. And so Professor Yalom is going to be talking, ah, up-- previous, about Teaching Psychotherapy Through Narrative. And certainly, he's a consummate storyteller so that will, ah, really, ah, work well. And then another thing that Professor Yalom does that's really, really special is that he will spend time for those of you who want him to autograph any books even after the conference. He'll be, ah, out in the, ah, lobby, ah, for the-- ah, of the convention center and he'll be available to sign your books if you brought them. Ah, he's just been spectacular about doing that even into the wee hours of the evening. So let me impose upon you for one more moment, as I explained with Professor Minuchin, there's been a few people who have had the honor of having standing ovation before they speak. And do you think that we could afford Professor Yalom that same honor?

IRVIN YALOM Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. First, let me check the sound, is it all right? Okay. Uhm, I'm very pleased to be here although I got very nervous walking over and I saw all this people rushing and I'm thinking, "Where is everyone going?" you know. In my last talk here, ah, four years ago, as those of you who attended might remember, I rather emphatically announced that my keynote would be my last public lecture. Remember, I was 78, I was-- ah, long passed, I thought the decent proper age to be investing large audiences, and yet here I am again, ah, with, with a bit of embarrassment, a lot of gratitude, ah, that aging has been gentle with me. I'm still seeing patience in writing and fortunately enough to be healthy and still have my wits about me sufficiently, let us hope, to offer you a, ah, ah, ah, useful and interesting to our keynote. Let me tell you what I'm gonna try to do today. I'm gonna spend some time talking about narrative in therapy, how and why I've tried to teach therapy through the use of fiction, of stories and novels and also then speak a bit about my last published work, ah, three years ago, that was called The Spinoza Problem, a novel. Then I wanna spend talking about a new endeavor since then. I've been working on a book of psychotherapy tales and I'm on the midst of writing that. And in the preparation for those tales, I've been reading and rereading my, my case notes, my process notes for months and months. And I've, I've come to see that I so-- that I say some of the same things to almost all my patients. Ah, I don't think I'm being monotonous and repetitive, I just think that some of these comments, ah, possess a good bit of therapeutic power. So I'm gonna spend some time describing, ah, some of these tips, ah, of, of therapy for you. And in the last part of my talk, I want to read two of my brand new teaching tales. Ah, these are tales that I'd never read aloud to an audience before so I'm a little nervous about that. Okay. So teaching psychotherapy, uhm, through narrative. I wanna begin with the somewhat provocative statement that fiction is the lie that tells the truth about the human psyche. Ah, that statement that I've adapted from a comment by canoe is really the underlying theme of a lot that I'm going to say about my writing. Because for decades I've tried to promulgate the truth about psychotherapy through, through narrative, through storytelling. Ah, I do feel often that I've got a duel identity. I'm a writer and I'm a psychotherapist. And, uhm, ah, all the time, in fact even Monday and Tuesday of this week, ah, I spend my mornings writing and my afternoons seeing patients. Uhm, and I've done that for, for many decades. But yet actually there isn't a real cleft between these two identities. Ah, I think they overlap considerably. For one thing, I want to say that, that all my writing is in the service of teaching therapy. Every writer I know have some kind of a secret target audience. And, and my target audience has always been, ah, has always been you, the young psychotherapist. And, and for me, all of you are young psychotherapist at this point. Uhm, in addition to that, I wanna make another point about this cleft between writer and, and therapist. The other point is that, that I think a writerly attitude often enhances the power of the therapy encounter. Uhm, I think I wanna begin by, by just, ah, giving you a brief description, ah, of my own development, both as a writer, ah, and as a psychotherapist. And I, I promise to do my best not to be self-indulgent as this the want of-- ah, so many of us octogenarians. So I'll start by saying that, that, ah, I've always been-- since adolescence, a, a great lover of literature and fiction and, uhm, ah, I'd, I'd love the, the great psychological, uhm, novelists Tes-- Tversky and Tolstoy and the British and French and American novelists. And early on in life I developed a persistent no-- notion. And one of the great things a person to do in life is write a really good novel. But when it came for me to choose an occupation my, my parents were immigrant, ah, and it seemed that-- for us it seemed that choice of occupation was very limited. And if we want to really enter the American culture, leave the old world culture, ah, many of us choice to, to become doctors. Then I went to medical school but from day one of my medical school I was, ah, already determined that I would become a psychiatrist, because I thought that was closer to the realm of the thinkers and the writers that I, that I love so much. I took my psychiatric training in Johns Hopkins. And in those days, this will be hard for you to believe, but in those days, a psychothera-- a psychiatric residency was primarily a place to learn about doing psychotherapy. And it maybe, hard as it may sound, you know, so many psycho-- psychiatric residents teach so little psychotherapy. And that there will be something else that may have sound you, when I went to medical school and start my residency, most of the good medical schools in this country, the departments of psychiatrist, the chairman were, were, were psychoanalysts and that its courses is unheard of now, chairman are neurochemist, neuroendocrinologist. Uhm, I was exposed at Johns Hopkins who, ah, a psychobiological school, they had very little to offer in those days. And who, ah, a psychoanalytic, ah, point of view. Ah, especially, ah, heavily accented with, ah, with interpersonal themes. The interpersonal school is-- ah, are what we call the Neu-Freudian school was the, the new co-- the unique contribution of, of American theorist to, to psychoanalytic thought, ah, and the theorist were, were people like, ah, Harry Stack Sullivan and Karen Horney and Erich Fromm. But I was never satisfied with the traditional analytic approach. It just seemed to me that too much time, too much effort was, was devoted to the ancient past, ah, to our distant past and too little time on the future. Too little time on what was going to become of us. Too little time spent on aging, concerns about death. When I was a first year student, a very interesting book was published that, that had a, a, a, a large effect on me and that was well-amazed book on existence. Ah, it was his essays on an existential perspective and also his transla-- his translations of several European existential philosophers. Ah, and that was, that was a real opening for me. It meant that there was the third way. Beside psychobiology and psychoanalysis, there was another point of view, ah, a kind of an existential therapeutic point of view, and that's been important to me ever since that third option. In my training also in addition to this, uhm, well, at, at that point, after reading all those books, I want to say I felt it was very important for me to learn something about philosophy. I had a straight science pre-med course and at that point I started my education philosophy and began taking undergraduate courses, at, uhm, at John Hopkins. And also I began to, ah, understand the usual historical perspective of our field. I said something about this in the history panel we did yesterday. Ah, the usual historical perspective is also in the psychotherapy is something to begin in the, in the late 19th century with, with Freud and, and Jung. But the truth is it became quite clear to me that the, that the life philosophers, the Layman's philosophers, the philosophers who are dedicated to understanding life and how we should live. And they go back thousands of years to the, to the ancient Greeks like Epicurus. Ah, so the, ah, psychotherapy history has a very, very long background. When I was at Johns Hopkins, I was very fortunate enough to have a lot of exposure to Jerome Frank. He was a pioneer in the field of, of group therapy and I developed an abiding interest in group therapy. So with that background, I came to Stanford. That was my first time, my first job in academic psychiatry. I've been there my entire career. Uhm, and, uhm, if you're going to stay at a university at Stanford, you're gonna have to publish a lot of research articles and doing site too. In my case, psychotherapy research which I did in published articles in professional research journals. Ah, but during this early days, the, the-- I was beginning to get some sort of sense, of, of power of narrative several times. Let me give you one example. I, I, I would spend a lot of time teaching group therapy to my, my students in my psychiatric residence. And mainly, I did this for a series of lectures, but also they observe me do a psychotherapy group. An hour-- for the whole first year, an hour and a half of watching the group, 30 minutes of rehashing the group afterwards. Two hours of their busy work, lots of rousing, lots of complaining, lot of absenteeism among the residence. But what was very interesting is after, after the weeks went by, after several weeks passed, I began finding that the, ah, the residence began to change their tone, they began to be more interested in what was happening. Ah, they began to be kind of curious about what was gonna happen during the next week. Ah, they began to be, ah, attending every, every session. They jokingly refer to my group as Yalom's patent place. Patent place, ah, those of you who are-- may remember was a daytime radio seri-- serial-- a television serial. So they were eager to see what happened next week, eager to see the patients. And I consider that attitude, ah, an excellent posture for good therapy. I know that when I grasp my patient story, when I'm interested, my core interest builds. I'm, I'm curious to know what happens during the week. Ah, I, I see the patient with pleasure. It's like, like almost starting the next chapter of a Dickens novel or Stephen King novel. Ah, well, I, I think this is a good posture for good psychotherapy. I think that attitude is, is unmistakably apparent to my patients. Uhm, and, uhm, I think it enhances the power of therapy. So now I'm still seeing patients in consultation. I had a patient just a few weeks ago who, who called and, ah, said he wanted a consultation. He was an older man. He had lost his families, wife, ah, and his parents were all dead. And he lost his siblings. He'd gotten remarried. He's doing very well in life. But he-- there's something that really puzzles him that he wants some help with. And that his brother who has died, he can't forget-- he can't get over his brother's death. He's gotten over all of his other sibling's death, he can't get over his brother's death. He enters his dreams and he thinks of him at lot. "And the very funny thing, Dr. Yalom, is that I don't even like that brother. You know, I hardly spend any time with him so why can't-- why do I keep thinking about him?" Well when I saw him in consultation, I mean, I'm really interested in this, I'm thinking, "Oh, there's an interesting mystery here. There's a story in here somewhere." And I don't mean a story to write, but that could happen too, but a story that I'll experience. And I'd, I'd love that attitude going in to see a therapy. Did my writerly curiosity get in the way of the, of the therapy? Not at all. I think it was quite, quite the opposite. I think they increased my interest and allowed me to do a better job. After a few years of teaching there I decided to write a, a, a group therapy textbook, there once in a good textbook through that time that I thought. So thank you, thank you. So, so, so I wrote a textbook about group therapy and I, I wrote it from the standpoint of an interpersonal posture towards a therapy group. From the, from the posture that our patients come to see us and fall on to despair to a very large extent because they cannot establish and maintain a, a nurturing new-- a nurturing important relationship. And a group therapy is, is the ideal arena in which we investigate relationships. So when people come to start the therapy group, I tell them that the most important thing that each of you can do in this group is to understand everything that happens between you and every other member of this group and, and me included. That's what your focus is. And people will say, well, ah, you know, I've, I've got problems with something else, I've got problems with my wife or with my boss or all this other things. But, but in fact, with the idea of the group being a social microcosm all those other problems will emerge in the here and now of the interaction between this-- between the patients, with, with one another and with the therapist. I, uhm, I think that novel ha-- that book has been, ah, quite successful. I've heard from a number of students that they, ah, they enjoyed reading it, but not so much because it's clearly written, ah, but they enjoyed reading it because it is studded with small stories in it. Some of them just a couple of sense-- some of them are a few pages. I've smuggled a lot of stories into that textbook, and I think that's what, that's what's made it useful. They're willing, they've told me. Many people have said this, they're willing to put up with a lot of dry theory because there maybe another story coming around the bands very soon. A few years later, I wrote a textbook on existential therapy which had been on the back burner, ah, for a long time. I, I waited until I got 10 years at Stanford before I spend a lot of time writing that, writing that textbook. I wrote a textbook for a field that doesn't exist. Ah, I never think of the existential psychotherapy is a freestanding field. I always consider that, that, that it's important for every therapists to have an increased sensibility and comfort in dealing with existential issues because they will, they will be a parent in here later in every course of therapy. That book, ah, existential therapy has really been the mother book for a lot of books and my fiction that does come after that. But the real turning point in, in, in my relationship to narrative came with the book called Love's Executioner. Uhm, I, I know that many of you are familiar with that. Uhm, ah, each of this stories, there are meant to be teaching tales. Each of this stories has meant to illustrate some aspect of an existential approach in psychotherapy. Uhm, I've had some-- I've revisited that book quite recently because I-- they put out a new edition, and I wrote a new epilogue to that book. I've also-- there's a new-- there's an audio book of it that's out. My wife and I have just been listening to the first couple of stories. Ah, I have very strong reaction listening to that. I'm thinking on the one hand, ah, this is really a good writing, I'm really proud of this. But on the other hand, I'm thinking, this guy writes a lot better than I can right now do. Uhm, I took a big plunge after that book and, and wrote a novel, ah, When Nietzsche Wept. But in writing, in writing that novel, I, I still considered, maybe this is rationalization that in writing this novel I still considered myself performing my university duty still being a teacher. I meant that to be a teaching novel. And there are several things I wanted to teach. This is quite explicit in my mind. I wanted to, to take the student back to the days that psychotherapy began to when it was invented. And it really began over a very short period of time. Ah, you know, be-- ah, ah, if you're looking at the, ah, 18-- 19-- 1890 or so you're gonna hard time finding any psychotherapy, there weren't any. It began very-- at a very certain period of time at 1893. I want to take the students back to that time and see if they could get a different feel for psychotherapy by, by participating, your big witness to its, to its inception. Maybe it's like training a car mechanic, by letting one of the factory until the car is put together for the first time. Uhm, so it was a teaching vehicle, for me it was writing a novel but with training wheels in that, in that it-- I didn't have to invent a whole lot. It was historically accurate, I invented very few fictional characters. All I did was put a fictional 13th month in 1893. So it was a little easier to write than to starting a novel from scratch. I was trying to teach something in that book. Uhm, so I was trying to teach how therapy was invented, but, but a twist. The twist is, what would psychotherapy look like if it were invented not by a physician, scientist like Freud, but suppose it had been invented by a philosopher, by Friedrich Nietzsche for example, how different would it have been? Another way of looking it, what was going on in my mind as I wrote that, those are rather, ah, strange sort of a thought experiment that I was, that I was doing. Here's the thought experiment. It's a little convoluted but try to stay with me on this. Imagine what might have happened had Friedrich Nietzsche, a, a, a great voice. But if Friedrich Nietzsche, a man who live in great despair, if he were placed in a certain moment and time in history, time and place in history where he would have been enabled to invent a psychotherapy from his own published writings, that could have been used to cure himself. Okay, do you follow me on that? That's, that's what I had in mind when I wrote that book. Uhm, I wrote another novel, ah, Lying on the Couch, which is a novel about, uhm, it was a novel about self-exposure. How much do we disclose about ourselves as, as, ah, as therapist? There was an old, ah, colleague of Freud, his name Sandor Ferenzi who at one point conducted an, ah, an outrageous, audacious experiment, experiment where he was going to maximize his self-disclosure. He was gonna analyze a patient one hour and the patient who is a therapist was gonna analyze him the next hour. He called it mutual analysis. And you can see this if you look at the clinical diaries of Ferenzi. So he, he, he and the patient change places on the couch. And after a few months, Ferenzi, ah, counseled the experiment. He called it off, ah, for what didn't seem to be very, very good reasons. I thought, he said, well, there are problems about who's gonna charge who. And, and then he, ah, and then he thought, well I couldn't really be free in my speech because I would have to talk about my other patients, ah, and that would be violating confidentiality. I thought that there are ways to get around that. So I reran that experiment in Lying on the Couch where a therapist decides he's gonna disclose himself entirely to a patient. Uhm, Lying on the Couch, by the way-- ah, When Nietzsche Wept is, is a movie, it's out on, ah, NetFlix, ah, it's-- I'd rather read the book, but it's a good movie and it's got a wonderful actor playing Nietzsche. Ah, Lying on the Couch is being made as a film. The production has started on that. I don't, I don't know the, I don't know the name of the movie yet. They-- ah, but I know that Anthony Hopkins is gonna have a role in that one. So, thank you. Another book that I wrote-- by the way, in all these years, I was alternating fiction and, and nonfiction. I wrote The Gift of Therapy at a novel then I wrote, then I wrote, uhm, Staring at the Sun, then I wrote a novel. So then I, I started this book, The Schopenhauer Cure. Very, very clear ideas about what I was trying to teach in that. I was trying to teach, ah, group of psychotherapy through fiction. Ah, the whole-- a whole book takes place in a therapy group and the leader also, ah, is dealing with mortality and that he has a fatal illness. So it's also a strong existential theme, ah, in that book. In my additions of my group therapy textbook, I cross-ref-- cross-reference that book. I'll say, if you wanna find out more about subgrouping see these pages in, in the Schopen-- in the Schopenhauer Cure. Now this last novel that I've written, The Spinoza Problem, ah, ah, ah, there's a different emphasis there. I don't have a specific theme, but instead I wanted to use the, the tool that all of you have and I have which is we have skills that entered into and understand the inner life of an individual. So I wanted to enter into and understand the inner life of this man named Spinoza. I think the name Spinoza is familiar probably to most of you. Ah, I think fewer of you really know what his work was about and I think very few of you have read his work because he's very hard to read. He writes as a mathematician. I can't read his work without reading a good, a good guide. But nonetheless, this man Spinoza has intrigued me for a long period of time. Uhm, ah, for years I wanted to write about him. What I knew about him then was that he was a 17th century thinker. He's born 164-- ah, 1632. He lived his life as an isolated, ah, poor person. Ah, but nonetheless, who, who wrote books, two books really, and, and no publisher would put their names on these books because they were dynamite. Ah, they were really dangerous. Ah, Spinoza is one of the, the great, most dangerous rebels in history. Ah, he, he authored two books that really from the standpoint of, of intellectual development changed the world. He anticipated secularization. Ah, he lived the life of a secular person in a century in which no one else had ever done that. Ah, he anticipated the liberal democratic political state. Ah, our declaration of independence has much of Spinoza and it, it comes by way of other philosophers especially John Locke. But he wrote a great deal about political freedom. He also paved the way for the rise for the enlightenment and championed the rise of natural science. Uhm, and also I was very intrigued by the fact that he was excommunicated by the Jews when he was 24 years old and he was, he was censured and chastised by the Christians for the rest of his life. I couldn't help thinking, he must be doing something very interesting and important here. Ah, maybe I was-- I-- maybe I was fascinated with him because of my own iconoclastic proclivities. But, but I also wanted to write about Spinoza because he's highly relevant to, to our field. He's contributed a lot although it's a long time ago. Ah, let me give you some examples. He, he for example wrote that ideas and thoughts and feelings are caused by previous experiment-- ah, previous experiences. Freud was, Freud was very aware of that and noted that. He also wrote that passions maybe studied this passionately. He also wrote that understanding leads to transcendence. And certainly that's terribly important. Those are important for Freud and again, Freud noticed that, that, that, that insight leads to, to, ah, to, to understanding. So I wanted to celebrate his contributions with noble of ideas. But how do you write about a man who lives entirely in his mind? Ah, there's so few external events. He was a very invisible person in his writings. You cannot find him in his writings. He took out every mention of himself. He didn't wanna resort to any writer because he wanted his writings be judged only on sheer reason. So, ah, and he also ordered all of his-- he asked all of his, ah, followers and students to, to destroy any personal comments that were in his correspondence which is rather extensive. So all of that material is destroyed. So how do you write a novel about a person who has no family dramas, no family, no love affairs, no anecdotes, feuds, uhm, no car chases. Ah, you know, there-- ah, how-- and he lived up as a placid and gentle soul. Some compared him to a saint. Some even to Jesus. Uhm, so how do you write a novel about this man? And that's when I thought, well, I'll write a novel about his inner life, because after all as, as a therapist I might be able to get inside him. He was a human being, he must have struggled with some of the same basic conflicts that we all did. Uhm, uhm, he must have had a strong emotional response to being excommunicated by the Jews. He was-- this is at the age of 24. He lived in the Jewish section of Amsterdam. Everybody he ever knew in his life no longer could talk to him, look at him, get within 15 feet of him. And that excommunication ban was never lifted and no Jew ever spoke to him again for the rest of his life. Except one, and that was fictional, that was the character in my novel. Uhm, so, I know that of course being human he, he have to have an inner life full of fantasies and dreams and passions, a yearning for love. About a fourth of his major work, a book called The Ethics is a long chapter, ah, which is entitled overcoming the bondage to passions. You know, this is just what we do in our work. So I don't think he could possibly written that unless he was dealing with his own struggle with his own passions. But I was stuck for years, ah, trying to figure out, how do you write a novel about this? Nobody else has been able to do it either. A couple of people have tried, they've been very bad. Uhm, so I went to Amsterdam a few years ago and asked as part of my recompense for my lectures that I'd be given a Spinoza day, and, uhm, I, I was assigned to, ah, to accompany, ah, a very, ah, a very good Spinozian, ah, psy-- ah, psychother-- ah, philosopher and also the head of the Spinoza Society. They took me on a Spinoza day. My, my wife and I went to see where Spinoza was born and, ah, where he died and where he was buried and all the houses after his excommunication. He was in a series of boarding houses, rented rooms. He was always, ah, always poor. As we saw all those, the only really interesting thing though was visiting his museum, Spinoza Museum, 45 minutes outside of the Amsterdam, a building about maybe 25 by 25, very small. The only thing of real interest in it was his library, all about 150 odd books that were in his library, all of course, 17th century and earlier, all the books that he-- had, had educated Spinoza. Ah, the lib-- the museum was closed but they opened it on this special day just, just for us so I could go in and do what-- just use and can do is pick up the books. So I'd picked up the books, the books that Spinoza actually had in his hands and I began to feel little inspirited by Spinoza, I was getting a little closer to him. Until one of my guides coughed and said, "Well, you know, Dr. Yalom, these aren't really the books that he touched." I, I said, "What do you mean?" "Well, he had no money, and when he died they had to auction off all of his library and to bury him." "So where did these books come from?" I said. "Well, 100 years ago a philanthropist donated some here and we could reconstitute the library. Because the auctioneer was a notary and very compulsive, very meticulous, he wrote down in every book where, where it was published, the name of the publisher is always a fictitious name because the publisher would acknowledge that he was publishing that book, ah, what color it was and, ah, describe the book. And we've reconstituted the same books that were in that library, but not the books he actually touched." So I said, "That's, that's a disappointment." Uhm, then I looked at the other thing in the library that caught my eyes. There's a nice portrait of Spinoza. It's in the cover of my book and all of you have seen the same portrait of Spinoza. I started looking at it, it's a beautiful face and he's got this very large oval eyes and they're heavy lidded. I started looking at those eyes and I became almost mesmerized by that. I was really having a spiritual, ah, ah, a spiritual session which is very rare for me with Spinoza, until my guides coughed and interrupted me, he says, "Well, you know, Dr. Yalom, that's not really what he had looked like. That no picture that was ever made in Spinoza ever survived. That's just what some artists imagined that he had looked like." So, and that was really getting despairing. And then I heard my host in the other room, I heard the word Nazis. And then they told me a story, a very interesting story. And, and this was an epiphany for me, epiphany for me. This is how my novel started. They told me the story that in the beginning of World War II the, the Germans overran the low countries, ah, Holland, in Denmark, ah, ah, just in 24 hours with the big blitzkrieg. And right-- and after they invaded the Holland, ah, members of the Rosenberg Taskforce, this is Alfred Rosenberg, one of the leading inner circle Nazis who is in charge of all the German looting. At first, just the looting of Jewish goods, but later the looting of all goods. He was head of this society and Rosenberg's men came into this library and took all of his books. And, uhm, so I said, "You mean, you've had to constitute the library a third time?" He said, "No, that's the interesting story. Ah, they didn't burn these books as they burned every other thing that belonged to Jews throughout Europe. These books were safely guarded and hidden in a salt mine. And after the war, the whole library came back to Holland." I began taking, well, a historian here somewhere. Uhm, and then, then I found in the Nuremberg papers, you could find it on the web, it's very easy. There is a statement by the officer who actually confiscated these books. He said, "We came in, they tried to hide the books from me, but, ah, we, ah, we, we found the books, we loaded them into 16 crates and charred them away." And then there's this sentence. This should help us with our Spinoza problem. That's amazing to me. The Nazis had the Spinoza problem. The Nazis had this problem with this isolated little philosopher who lived 300 years before that. So that sentence really, ah, it was the spark that set this going and I began writing a novel almost immediately after that. I began writing the novel in terms of, ah, alternating chapters, more on Spinoza, what happened to him, what happened to him after the, uhm, you know, after the, the, ah, big thrown off, ah, excommunication by the Jews. I wanted to write about its philosophy and ways that, that people can understand what he was saying because it was so important. And I won't introduce the character, but continue to communicate with Spinoza, ah, ah, who has deserved as the kind of therapist for Spinoza. So that's where I began to enter into his inner life. And to alternate with chapters about this man Rosenberg who fancied himself a philosopher, who may have been treated by Spinoza, and I followed his life through from the time he was about 15 until he was hanged at Nuremberg. So the book takes place in the alternating chapters between this two. I wanted to introduce a therapist into both sections. I, I mentioned the one to Espinoza. It was not very hard to introduce a, a psychiatrist, a-- into Rosenberg's life because he was in psychiatric hospitals a couple of times. And we even have a letter that one of the psychiatrist worked to Hitler about him. So, is this book fact or fiction? I don't know. He once said that fiction is a history that could have happened, whereas history is fiction that did happen. Okay. So this is fiction that, this is fiction that could have happened.

IRVIN YALOM Uhm, and one thing, one more thing about that, there's a very exciting new development in that. Ah, few months ago, Rosenberg's diary was discovered. Perhaps, some of you, you've read about this in the newspaper. That's a 400-page handwritten diary, ah, that one of the Nuremberg attorney is told and when he had died recently, they found this diary there and they had now, ah, turned it over to the Holocaust Museum and it will be, it will be released for the public fairly soon. Ah, I'm very eager about this. I mean, after all, how often does a novelist have an opportunity to see how close he got to his inner life. So I've got, I've got either be very disappointed or very happy and a little wild about that, about that diary. Okay. So let me turn now to, uhm, the current project that I'm working on, I'm working on a, ah, a new book of stories. Uhm, the way I've written these stories by creating a process was this, and a lot of you were doing-- writing on your own. I've kept-- I've done that more entry bookkeeping from my process notes with patients. I keep process notes and then I have a second version of some of the more interesting ideas of books and that was separate for all the ideas from books. And that folder have gotten very, very large over the years. In the last two and a half years, I've reading and rereading those files and I've been just lo-- I will not take in a whole case history like I did in Love's Executioner, I'm searching for the incident that somehow have some energy into it. So I'm reading and rereading the, the ones and putting an asterisk, one or two or three asterisks and reading over the asterisks on to finally I find the incident, it says, the strapping with energy, and I begin writing the story about that. Ah, and then I take maybe what I remember about that patient, I don't go over the notes again, no, and I, I create, ah, I create a story from that. Ah, this tale serve then as I lie. I think it tells the truth about psychotherapy. Uhm, nevertheless having said that, there's still enough accuracy in these stories that I, I obtained-- I had to obtain the written permission from patients of each of this stories, except for, ah, one patient who, who, who died. So I began as I mentioned rereading a lot of them and came across these incidents, these statements that I made over and over again and I'm gonna just point a few of them to you, not in any particular order. Maybe I've said some of this elsewhere before. But some of this you knew. The first one is already-- I've already had kind of referred to it which is process notes. I just urge you all to take process notes after each session. It's very easy to do especially today with all the dictating programs. I use, ah, drag and dictate from Mac. In, in less than five minutes since I've finished seeing the patient, I dictate a very long note of everything that I can recall going on in that session. I don't make phone calls or check email between the patient who is leaving and doing the dictation, that's still very fresh in my mind. So less than five minutes the most. And then still point in taking the notes, unless you read them before the next session and that takes about three minutes. So I always read the notes before the next session. And, ah, in fact I'm very comfortable, and I often do, start the next meeting by asking the patient, "What feeling is your left over from the last session?" What I'm trying to do is make this process continuous, from session to session. We're not starting a whole different thing in the next session. I think the more continuous the course of therapy is the more potent it is. Another concept, I also have written a bit about this as the concept of regrets. Whenever I hear a patient talking about regrets, I, I wanna, I wanna hone in on that, I wanna explore that. Not necessarily with an eye on the past, what they regret in their life, but with an eye on the future, because I wanna get to the question that, that I think it becomes important. If you imagine if we were meeting a year or two years from now, what new regrets which you have built up in your life? Because of course what we're aiming for, for all of us, for ourselves too is to how to live a regret-free life. So that's one point I wanna make about regrets. Another point. I think it's-- whenever possible, I wanna bring the re-- idea of regrets into the therapy here and now. In other words, I wanna try to get to the issue of what regrets you've just had about this hour we've had. Let me give you an example of this. This is the from Spinoza cure. It's an, it's an attempt to use that method in working with this, with this Nazi, Alfred Rosenberg. Alfred Rosenberg has come to visit the psychiatrist for the first time. He knew him as a child, they were together, they were playmates for their children, so there's a little bit of, of comfort in seeing this person. They came to see him but he didn't have the courage to talk about what he came to see. So it was a shallow, superficial hour. The hour was brilliant to an end. The psychiatrist says, "Wait a moment. Before you get ready to leave, Alfred, I have one last question for you. Let me ask you to imagine something. Close your eyes and imagine you're leaving my office now. Imagine walking away from our talk. Imagine sitting on that train and taking that long ride back to Munich. Tell me, are you-- do you have that in your mind?" Alfred close his eyes and nodded right in us. "Now here's what I want you to do. I want you to think back on our talk tonight and ask yourself this question, do I have any regrets about my talk with Friedrich? Were there important issues I did not raise?" Alfred kept his eyes close, and after a long silence, he slowly nodded and says, "Well, there is one thing," and then went on to talk about the real reason he came to see the psychiatrist, the real reason being that he was, uhm, although he was a member of Hitler's inner circle, he, he feared he felt he was certain that Hitler did not love him like he love the others. He never invited him to lunch. He never invited him to ride in his Mercedes like he invited Goebbels and Göring. He was always left out in that way. Nobody liked Alfred Rosenberg. In fact, one of the Nazis at Nuremberg was interviewed and as he said the only thing with Nazis had in common is we all hated Alfred Rosenberg. Okay. So that's an approach and that's the kind of approach I've, I've often taken with patient. Well let me extend this even further. Try to find the here and now equivalent of this topic. Here's what I mean. And one of the stories, another one of the story, this story I read at the, ah, American Counseling Association that many of you attended. I was in a conversation with the patient who had, ah, advanced cancer. I asked her about her regrets in life. She tell me she had regrets. She described some important regrets in terms of not having been bold enough in her life, not having been bold enough with employers, ah, ah, not having been bold enough in asking with some exploitative of roommates and friends. So I believe you can always ratchet up to power or shifting to the here and now. So the kind of question I would ask her in that situation was, "You feel-- you know what, do you feel you've been bold enough here with me today?" And she hesitated and then answered, "No, certainly not." So then I asked her, "If you had acted more boldly, what might you have said?" And her answer was, "I would have asked you, why are you charging me so much money? Why do you need so much money?" And I can tell you that really increase the energy. And I think efficacy of, of that session are you have to read that in, in the rest of that in, in the, in the book. Uhm, the next tip I wanna talk about is inherent in the wording of that last statement and that is the conditional voice. If you had acted more boldly with me, what might you have said. It sounds like a, it sounds like a sleight of hand, you know, conjurer's trick, and I don't like to use tricks in the therapy. But this one usually works. It puts a cushion between the patient and the risk they are taking. If you'll save her, they're not really saying it, ah, it's what they-- if they were to say it, this is what they were to say. So I use that conditional voice quite often to ease the risk for patients. Here's another tip and it's something I'm doing in therapy very frequent and in fact almost with all my patients unless it's very evident it's not necessary. When I see a patient in the first session, I say to them, "You know, therapy will work best, ah, for you if you take a risk at every session." Uhm, maybe somebody will ask what that means, what kind of a risk, it's while you-- when you feel yourself your, your, your own edge, you feel you're doing something that's very hard, you're telling me something you maybe have never told anyone else before. Uhm, so that's what it means by taking a risk. And of course, it means that you've got to trust me, you've got to have a good sense of trust in me. And if for any reasons, ah, you don't-- we've got to talk about that, it's critically important we discuss that if therapy is gonna work. Are there any questions you wanna ask me to check that out? Then, later on, fifth, sixth, eighth, 10th meeting, the meeting is shallow, unproductive, ah, and I feel therapy, ah, it is, it's not a vital session, and I'll, I'll remind them of that. "Remember what I've said in the first session? Uhm, have you-- do you feel you've been close to taking a risk today? What's happened? What, what's blocking you?" Or, "Ah, when did you come close today in taking a risk? Can we go back to that spot?" Or let me ask you, in the-- let me ask you something, even though we wouldn't have time to explore than that, if you were to have taken a risk, what might it have been? Again, that, that conditional voice. And of course, when a patient takes the risk, you always support that deeply. Ah, and after the risk, you ask for feelings so you, you process the risk and the feelings. Ah, the most common feeling might be speaking of being embarrassed. But then embarrassment is always an interpersonal phenomenon. You're not embarrassed in a, a room, in a solitary room, you're always embarrassed with someone else. And embarrassment means that you have some hunches about how I might be feeling. So in this instance, here's a place, you can check that out. What questions do you have for me? I ask that question more and more as I get older with patients. Do you have questions for me? This makes our, uhm, this makes neophyte therapist very, very nervous, I know. Ah, you don't want patients to be asking you questions. But I, I realized that at this point. I'll give some examples of this in one of the stories that I'm gonna read so I won't talk about that anymore. A few more minutes. I'm gonna take the whole time. We started late because of the introductions and things. So we'll go on another few minutes and then take a break. Another statement that I've made, I've written about this elsewhere, but I, I find that making to almost every patient which is the statement you're going to have to give up the hope of a better childhood, you know. It's a strong, strong statement. People remember that. In fact, a lot of patients remember it better than I do cuz they say, "You already have told me that, Dr. Yalom." Uhm, but I think it has a lot of power. Uhm, and it's almost always true with a few exceptions. One exception came out recently for me, is a patient who, uhm, was always the unfavored one in her family. Her powers never gave her anything new. They always brought her used clothes, ah, ah, whereas they may have treated her other siblings much better. She was the, the black sheep. She, ah, got pregnant at a very young age, had a forced marriage. For a wedding present, they gave her, ah, a television set which then broke down after a couple of months so she never could use it. So that's the way she tell me about her life. But now, her mother is getting very old and is creeping towards dementia. And she's been having long talks with that about her mother, about her childhood, trying to get more information. And she told this aging mother the story about the television, the used television set she had gotten after she got married. She never had had the money to get it repaired. And the mother said, "What? That was a brand new set. Your father and I decided we wanted to get you something really nice so we bought a new set and they had it warranted." So, ah, so she never knew that and, ah, so her childhood suddenly got a little bit better in her life. Closely associated with that, there's the idea that I often say to patients that your mother or your father or your parents did not have it to give. Ah, many parents-- many patients begin to develop more empathy for their parents. They begin to learn more about their parents' life, derive in a lot more understanding and see that their parents were passing on something from their parents and passing on something from their parents. And, and, and she's, she's being quite so angry cuz they didn't have the love to give, they didn't have the time to give. Sometimes, ah, the, the children of immigrants, there's another situation which they feel very shame to parents for being so ignorant and un-- uneducated, ah, and then they, they may develop themselves but they-- even if they're successful, they have a feeling of a lily growing in a swamp, there's no foundations under them and they're always a little cajun and, and, ah, nervous about what's going to happen. Associa-- associated that's another idea is, but you can't change the past, but you can break the cycle, the cycle that's been passed on from generation to generation, ah, to let patients know what they've done with their children, take some pride in the fact that you broke that cycle, ah, and you, you've gotta be proud of that. Ah, patient was telling me about his mother whose-- the dietary habits in his parents' family as the mother made dinner somewhere four or five o'clock in the afternoon, left it out on a table, and everyone in the family would come and take something and eat in their room. And he's been very careful to have regular mealtimes for his family where they could get together and talk. So, ah, so I, I urge him to, to pick some pride in that. Uhm, one last thing, a question-- there are patients as you know you've all had them who externalize a great deal. Ah, everything is always someone else's fault. So I begin to ask patients what pers-- you all do this too, I know, what percent of your problems do you think are caused by yourself? Uhm, let, let me, let me give you example of this. This is from Spinoza problem also. Friedrich the psychiatrist is, is treating this arrogant, very, very grandiose Nazi who always externalizes. Friedrich tried another tact that almost always is truthful. "Here Alfred, let me put it in another way? What percentage of the problem you're facing are caused by others? Is it 20 or 50% or 70 or 90%?" Alfred says, "There's no way to measure that." "Of course, but I don't expect the accuracy. I simply want your wildest aspect. Humor me on this, Alfred." "All right, let's say, 90%." "Good, good, and that means that 10% of this aggravating events had upset you are your responsibility. That can give us some direction. You and I need to explore that 10% because that's the only thing we can really change here in this room. Let's see if we can change it. Are you with me, Alfred?" Alfred says, "I'm getting that strange lightheaded feeling I've got in each time I've spoken to you." "That's, that's not necessarily a bad thing, Alfred. The process of change often feels destabilizing. So get back to work. Let's examine that 10%. I wanna know what role you play in other's treating you so abusively." Alfred, "I've already covered that. I told you it was the envy of the common man for the one with soaring imagination and intellect." "People are mistreating you because your superiority belongs to the 90%, Alfred. Let's stay focused on the 10% and your part of it." Ah, and so on. He was not very successful in working with, with Alfred Rosenberg, I'm afraid. Okay. An hour is up. Let's take a short break and then I wanna tell you some stories on the book. Okay. Thank you.

The Evolution of Psychotherapy December 11-15 2013 ANAHEIM 

01:06:30
IRVIN YALOM Okay. Let's start. So I'm gonna read you two stories. Ah, the stories have to do with the, the, the, the way the therapist is with, with his or her own patients. The first story is entitled On Being Real, On Being Real. Charles, a 36-year-old ambitious business executive, have the right stuff behind him, sterling education and over Harvard and Harvard Business School, a grandfather and a father who are successful bankers, a mother who is head of the Board of Trustees over college. And he have the right stuff around him, a condo and a panoramic view from golden gates to the bay bridge, a lovely, socially prominent wife amidst six-figure salary, a Jaguar, an XK Convertible. Yet no good stuff inside, choked by self-doubt and incrimination and guilt, Charles always perspired when he saw a police car on the highway. "Free flooding guilt searching for a sin," he said, "That's me." Moreover his dreams were relentlessly self-denigrating. He had large weeping wounds. He coward in a cellar cave. He was a little life allowed the criminal of fate. But even as he demeaned himself in dreams, his quirky sense of humor shown through. In this dream, for example, I was waiting in a group of people who are auditioning for a role in a film. I waited my turn, perform my role quite well. Sure enough the director called me back in the waiting area and complimented me. He'd then asked about my previous film roles. And I told him that I never had one. He slammed his hands on the table, stoop up, and shouted as he walked out, "You know, actor, you're impersonating an actor." I ran after him and shouting, "If you impersonated an actor, you are an actor." But he kept on walking. He was now far in the distance. I screamed as loud as I could, "The actors impersonate people and that's what actors do." But it was no use. He had vanished, I was alone. Charles insecurity seemed fixed and unaffected by any signs of worthwhileness. All the things are positive, accomplishments, promotions, messages of love from wife, children, and friends, great feedback from clients pass through him as water through a sieve. Even though we had in my view a good working relationship, he persisted in believing I was impatient or bored with him. I once commented that he had holes in his pockets. And that phrase resonated with him and he often repeated it during our work. After hours of examining the source of his self-contempt, scrutinizing all of the usual suspects, let last her IQ scores, failure to fistfight the elementary school bully, adolescent acne, ah, occasional premature ejaculations, worried about the small size of his penis, we eventually arrived at the primal source of darkness. "Everything bad began," Charles told me, "one morning when I was eight years old, my father who was, who was an Olympic sailor sit out on a windy gray day on his regular morning sail of his small boat from Bar Harbor, Maine and never returned. That day he's fixed on my mind, the horrendous family vigil, the growing angry storm, my mother's relentless pacing, our calls from friends and coastguard, our fixation on the telephone resting on the red checkered kitchen table and our growing apprehension at the shrieking wind and approaching night fall. And worst of all, it was my mother's wailing early the next morning when the coastguard phones with the news that they had found his empty boat floating upside down, his body was never found. But that event happened 28 years ago." Charles described this as if it was yesterday and tears flow down both cheeks. That was the end of the good days, the end of my father's warm bear hugs and the games of horseshoes in catch. I know at that time that nothing would ever be the same. Charles' mother mourn the rest of her life and no one came along to replace his father. In his view, he became his own parent. He as being self-made person has these good points. Self-creation can be powerfully reaffirming, but it's lonely work and often in the dead of night, Charles ached and yearned for the warm hug that had grown cold so long ago. A year ago, Charles met James Perry, a high-tech entrepreneur at a charity event. The two became friendly, and after several meetings James offered Charles an attractive executive position and a new startup. James, 20 years older, had the Silicon Valley golden touch and accumulated, and accumulated a vast fortune. But as he said, he could not get off the game and continues to launch companies. Their relationship part friend and part employer and employee, part mentor and protégé was complex, Charles and James negotiated it with grace. Their work required considerable travel but they'd never failed to meet at the end of the day for drinks and conversations whenever they were both in town. And Charles cherish those intricate meetings. It was then soon after meeting Perry that Charles first contacted the paradoxical, the-- I seem to seek therapy during hosting time of nurture and mentorship there's already explanation. Perry's caring and fathering has thought Charles' memory of his father's death and they came more aware of what he had missed. During our fourth month of meeting, Charles called-- request an urgent meeting. The following day he appeared in my office with an ash in the face. He walk slowly through his chair, lowered himself carefully into it, and with tears in his eyes said, "He's dead." "Charles, what happened?" "James is dead. Massive stroke, instant death. He's wife told me, she, she had a meeting with the board, came home, and found James slumped in the living room chair, hadn't been sick. Christ, totally, totally unexpected." "What a shock this must be for you." "Tried to describe but I can't find the words, such a good man, so privileged man, so kind to me. I knew it. I knew it all the while he was too good to last." "Boy, I really feel for his wife and kids and I feel for you," I said. Over the next two weeks, Charles and I met every other day. It couldn't work. Stopped poorly. Wept off during our sessions. Again and again, he expressed his respect for Perry and his deep gratitude for the time they had shared. The pain and past losses resurfaced, not only his father but also his mother three years and one month dead, Michael, a childhood friend who died in the 7th grade. Over and again, Charles spoke of shock. "Let's learn more about your shock. What are its ingredients?" "Death is always a shock." "Keep going, tell me about the shock." "It's self-evident." "Put it into words." "Poof, life is gone, just like that. There's no place to hide. There's no such thing as safety. Transiency. Life is transient. I knew that, who doesn't? But I never thought of it, never wanted to think of it. James' death makes me think of it. It enforces me too all the time. He was older. I knew he died before me, it just making me face things." "Say more. What things?" "About my own life. About my death that life is ahead. About the permanence of death. About being dead forever. Somehow, that thought being dead forever has gotten stuck in my mind. Oh, I envy my Catholic friends and thereafter life stuff. I wish I could buy into that." He took a deep breath and looked up at me, "So that's what I've been thinking about, and also lots of questions about what's really important." "Tell me about that," I've said. "I think about the pointlessness of spending all my life at work, making more money that I need. I've got enough from that, but I keep on going just like James. I feel sad about the way I've lead. I could have been a better husband, a better father. Thank God there's still time." Thank God there's still time. I woke on that hopeful thought. I've known many who've been able to respond to grieve in a positive fashion. Whose confrontation to prove the facts of life awaken them and catalyze major life changes. It looked as though that was gonna be through for Charles and I hope to help him take that direction. About three weeks after James Perry's death however, Charles entered my office in a highly agitated state. He was breathing fast. To calm himself, he put his head-- his hand in his chest and exhaled deeply as he slowly sank into his seat. "I'm really glad we're meeting today. We hadn't had this meeting scheduled. I would have called you last night. I've just had one of the biggest shocks of my life." "What happened?" "Margaux Perry, James' widow phoned me yesterday to invite me over cuz she had something that she wants to talk about. I visited her last evening and walk at right to the point here's what she said, "I didn't wanna tell you this, Charles, but too many people know it now. And I'd rather you hear it from me than someone else. James didn't die from a stroke, he committed suicide. And since then I can't see straight. The whole world has turned upside down." "How awful for you," I said, "Tell me all what's going on inside." "So much, a cyclone of feelings. It's hard to track it." "Start anywhere." "Well, one of the first things that flashed to my mind is, if he could commit suicide then so can I. I can't explain this any further except that I knew him so well. We were so close and he was like me and I was like him. And if he could do it, then so could I." That possibility shook the hell out of me. "Don't worry, I'm, I'm not suicidal." But the thought lingers, "If he could, and so can I." Death, suicide, they're no longer abstract thoughts, not any longer, they're real. "And why, why did he kill himself?" "I'll never find out. His wife is clueless or pretends to be. She said she was totally caught by surprise. I'll have to get use to never knowing." "Keep going, Charles, tell me everything." "The world is upside down. I don't know what's real anymore. He was so strong, so capable, so support of me, so caring, and yet think about it. At the same time, he was making a nest for me, he must have been so agonized he didn't wanna exist any longer." "What's real? What can you believe?" "All those times he was giving me support, giving me loving advice, at that same time, he must been contemplated in killing myself. Do you see what I mean? Those wonderful, boastful times when he and I sat talking. Those intimate moments we've shared. Well now I know those moments don't really exist, it never did exist. I felt connected. I heard everything, but it was a one-man show. He wasn't there. He wasn't blissful. He was thinking of offing himself. I don't know what's real anymore. I have fabricated my reality." "Charles, how about this reality? In this room, you and me, the way we are together." "I don't know what to trust, who to trust. There's no such thing as a we, Irv. I'm truly alone. I doubt, I doubt very much that you and I are experiencing the same thing at this very moment, right now as we speak. I say, "I want us to be a we as much as possible. There's always an unreachable gap between two people, but I wanna make that gap the smallest possible here in this room." "But Irv, I'm only guessing what you think and feel and look how long-- wrong I was with James. I guess we were doing a duet. But it was a solo number, and no doubt, I'm doing the same with you guessing wrong about you." Charles hesitated and then suddenly asked, "What are you thinking about me right now?" And 20 or 30 years ago, such a question would have truly rattled me. But as I've matured as a therapist, I've grown to trust my own conscious to behave in a responsible way and then know full well that it's not so much what I say about my thoughts. It's important, but rather that I'm willing to express them. So I said, but first thing that came to my mind, "My thought at the moment you asked that question was very odd it was something I saw yesterday that someone posted an unanimous website for secrets. She said, I work at Starbucks, and when customers are rude I give them a decaf." Charles looked up at me stunned and then suddenly erupted to laughter. "What? What's that got to do with anything?" "You asked what I was thinking and that's what popped into my mind. It popped into my mind that everybody has secrets. And let me try to track it. That train of thoughts started a couple of minutes earlier when you spoke of the nature of reality and how you've fabricated, remember?" Charles nodded. "And then I started thinking of how right you are. Reality is not something just out there. Reality is something each of us constructs or fabricates to a significant degree. Then for a moment, bare with me, Charles, you asked what I was thinking, I thought of the German philosopher Kant and how he taught us that the structure of our minds actively influences the nature of the reality we experience. And then I started thinking of all the deep secrets I've heard as a therapist over my half century of practice. And then however much we crave to merge with another there's always gonna remain distance. And then I started to think of the color red or the taste of coffee and how my experience red and coffee will be very different in ways we can never know. Coffee, coffee, that's it. That's the link to the Starbucks secret. But sorry, sorry, Charles, I'm afraid I'm wondering far where from where you may be." "No, no, not at all." "Well, tell me pass through your mind as I spoke." "I thought right on I like you're speaking like that, Irv. I love you're sharing your thoughts." "Well here's another thought that just came up. An old memory of a case presentation of a seminar when I was a student ages ago. The patient was a man who had a blissful honeymoon in some tropical island, one of the great times of his life. But the marriage deteriorated rapidly during the next year and they divorced. He learned at some point from his wife that throughout their time together including their honeymoon she had been obsessed with another man. His reaction was very similar to yours. He realized that their idyllic relationship on the tropical island was not a short experience. He too was playing it so low. I didn't recall much more but I do remember he also sense that reality was fractured." "Reality fractured. Sense of reality fractured. That speaks to me. It's there even in my dreams," he said. "The last time I had some powerful dreams. I can only recall a bit. I was inside of a doll's house, and touch the curtains and the windows and thought they were papers and cellophane. It felt flimsy and then I heard footsteps and I was afraid someone would stamp on the house." "Charles," I said, "Let me check in again about our reality. I'll give you a notice. I'm gonna keep on doing this? How are you and I doing right now?" "Better than anywhere else, I guess. I mean, we're more on us, but still there are gaps." "No, not some gaps, there are big gaps. We're not really sharing reality. Well, let's keep on trying to narrow the question. To narrow the gap, what questions do you have for me, Charles?" "Uhm, he never ask me that before. Well, many questions. How do you see me? What's it like to be in a room with me? How hard is this hour for you?" "Fair questions. I'll just let my thoughts run free. I'll try not to be systematic. I'm moved by what you're going through. I'm 100% in this room I like and respect you. I think you know that, and I hope you do. I have strong desire to help you. I think of how you've been haunted by your father's death. How it's left his mark on your whole life. And I think of how awful it's been to find something good in your relationship with James Perry and then to have that vanished to waste as suddenly. And I imagine also that the laws of your father and James Perry looms large in your feelings towards me. Let's see what else comes to your mind. I can tell you when I meet with you I face two different feelings that sometimes get in the way of one another. One the one hand, I wanna be like a father to you, but on the other hand I want you to get passed the need, not the wish for a father." Charles nodded as I spoke, looked down, remained silent, I asked, "And now, Charles, how real are we being?" He said, "I've misspoken. The truth is the major problem isn't you, it's me. There's too much I've been withholding, too much I've been unwilling to say." "For fear of driving me away?" Charles shook his head partly, "I was now certain I knew what it was." "That was my age. I'd been through this with the other patients. For fear of giving me pain?" I asked. He nodded. "Trust me, Charles, it's my job to take care of my feelings. I'll hang in there with you. Try to make a start." Charles loosened his necktie, unbuttoned his top button, or another one of last night's dreams will start this. "I was talking to you in your office, only it look like a wood shop. There was a stack of wood, a large table saw, and then suddenly you shrieked, grab your chest and stomped forward. I jumped up to help you. I called 9/11 and I held you till they came and then I help with them-- help them put you on a stretcher. There was more, but that's all I can remember." "Conscious about that dream?" "Well, it's very transparent. I'm very conscious of your age and worried about you dying. The good side, which shop element is obvious too in my dreams? I blended you-- and in my dream I blended you with Mr. Riley. I told-- I've mentioned him before, he was my wood shop teacher in junior high. He was very old and a bit of a father figure to me and used to visit him even if I graduated junior high. And feelings in the dream, it's vague, better to call it panic. And also a lot of pride in helping you." "It's good you're bringing this up, Charles, can you speak of another dreams you've avoided telling me?" "Oh, well, it's uncomfortable. There was a dream about a week ago that stuck in my mind. In the dream we're meeting like we are now in these chairs but there are no walls. I couldn't tell if we were inside or outside. You were grim-faced and you lean towards me and told me you had only six months to live. And then, this is really weird, I tried just talk a bargain with you. I would teach you how to die and you would teach me how to be a therapist. I don't remember much else except we were both crying a lot." "The first part is clear," I said, "of course you're aware of my age and worried about how long I'll live, but what about that second part, you wanna give me a therapist?" "I don't know what to make of that. I never thought I could be a therapist and maybe beyond me. I don't think I could deal of facing strong feelings all the time and now I admire you a lot. You've been kind, very kind to me, and always know how to point me in the right direction." I leaned over and take Kleenex and wipe his brow, "This is very difficult for me. You'd given me so much and here I sit inflicting pain but telling you these dreadful dreams about you, this is not right. Your job here is to share your thoughts with me and you're doing it well." "Of course, my age concerns you, we both know the statistics. We both know that at my age, 81, I'm approaching the end of my life, you're, you're now grieving for James and also for your father, it's only natural you worry about losing me too, 81, this was a year ago is old, shockingly old. I'm shocked myself when I think about it. I don't feel old. And over and over I wonder how I've got to be 81. I always used to be the youngest kid in my classes, on my summer camp baseball team, on a tennis team. Now suddenly I'm the oldest person anywhere I'd go, restaurants, movies, professional meetings. I can't get used to it." I took a deep breath. We sat quietly for a few moments. "Before we go further, I wanna stop for another check, Charles, how are you and I doing now, how about the size of the gap." "The gap has narrowed quite a bit," he said, "but this is really hard. This is not a normal conversation. You usually don't say to someone I'm worried about your dying. This has got to be painful for you and you-- right now, you were the last person as the world I wanna hurt." "But this is an unusual place," I said. "Here, we have or we should have no taboos against honesty. And keep in mind, you're not bringing up anything. I haven't thought about a great deal. A central part of the ethos of this field is keeping your eyes open to everything." Charles nodded. Another brief silence pass between us. "We're having far more silences today than ever before I've entered." Charles nodded again. "I'm rarely all here. I'm totally with you. It's just that this discussion is taking my breath away." I said, "There's something else I wanna tell you. Believe it or not, looking at the end of your life it can have some positive effects. I wanna tell you an odd incident, an odd experience I had a few days ago. It was about six o'clock in the evening. I saw my wife at the end of our driveway reaching to our mailbox. I walk towards her. She turned her head and smiled. Suddenly and inexplicably my mind shifted the scene. And for a few moments, I imagined being in a dark room watching a flickering home movie of scenes of my life. I felt much like the protagonist in Samuel Beckett's play Krapp's Last Tape. You know of that play?" "I've heard about it, but I don't know anything about it." "Well it's a monologue given by an old man on his birthday as he listens to tape recording she's made on passport days. So, somewhat like Krapp I imagined not listening to a tape but viewing a film of old scenes of my life. And there I saw my dead wife turning towards me with a large smile beckoning to me. And I watched her. I was flooded with poignancy. I don't imagine with grief. And suddenly, poof, it all vanished. I snapped back into the present. And there she was alive, radiant in the flesh, flashing her beautiful September smile. A warm flash of joy rushed over me. I felt grateful that she and I were both still alive. And I rushed to embrace her and begin our evening walk." I couldn't describe that experience without tears flowing up I reach for Kleenex. Charles also took a Kleenex to dab his eyes. "So you're saying here count your blessings?" "Yes, exactly. I'm saying that anticipating endings may encourage us to grasp the pleasant-- the present with greater vitality." Charles and I both glanced at the clock. We'd run over a few minutes. He slowly gathered his things. "I'm wiped out," he whispered, "You've got to be tired too." I stood up straight, shoulders back, "Not at all. Actually, a deep and true session like this enlivens me. You worked hard today, Charles. We worked hard together." I opened my office store for him as always. We shook hands. As I left, I close the door and suddenly I slap myself on the forehead and said, "No, I can't do this. I can't end it this way." So I opened the door, called him back, and said, "Charles, I just slipped back into an old note and did exactly what I don't wanna do. The truth is, I am tired from that hard deep work. I bit wiped out, in fact. I'm grateful that no one else on my schedule today." I looked at him and waited, I didn't know what to expect. "Oh, Irv, I knew that. I know you better than you think I do. I know when you're just trying to be therapeutic." Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

IRVIN YALOM My second teaching tale for the evening. The second and the last one. Ah, we're gonna go over just a few minutes. So, so I begin with the email with Paul Andrews. "Dr. Yalom, I'd like a consultation. I've read your novel When Nietzsche Wept and wondered if you'd be willing to see a fellow writer with a writing block," Paul Andrews. No doubt, Paul Andrews sought to pick my interest in his email and he succeeded. I'd never turn away a fellow writer. As to the writing block, well, I feel blessed not to have been visited by one of those creatures, but I was keen to help him tackle it. Ten days later, Paul entered my office. I was startled by his appearance. Somehow, I had expected a frisky, tormented, middle-aged writer. Yet entering my office was a wizened old man so stooped over he was scrutinizing the floor it appeared. As he entered slowly through my doorway, I, I wondered how he had made it to my office at the top of Russian hill. Almost able to hear his joints cricking, I took his heavy battered briefcase, held his arm, and guided him to his chair. "Thank you, thank you, young man. And how old are you?" "80 years old." "Ah, to be 80 again." "And you," I said, "how many years do you have?" "85. Yes, that's right, 85. I know that's true. You must-- people think-- yes, I'm in my 30s." I took a good look at him and for a moment, our glances locked. I felt charmed by his elfish eyes and the wisp of the smile playing on his lips. "85," I thought, "I'd love to be playful like that in 85." As we sat in silence for a few moments looking at one another, I imagined we basked in a glow of elder comradeship as though we were travelers on our ship in one cold foggy night found the conversation on a deck and discovered with had grown up in the same neighborhood. We instantly knew one another. Our parents had suffered through the great depression. We had witnessed those legendary duels between DiMaggio and Ted Williams and remembered ration in carts from butter and gasoline and VE day and Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath and Farrell's Studs Lonigan. No need to speak of any of this. We shared it all and our bomb felt secure. Now it was time to get to work. "So Paul, if I can use first names?" He nodded, of course. "All I know about you comes from your short email. You wrote that you're a fellow writer. You read my Nietzsche novel and you're in writing block." "Yes, and I'm requesting a single consultation, that's all. I'm on a fixed income, can afford and more." "I'll do what I can. Let's start immediately and be as sufficient as possible. Tell me what I should know about the block. If it's all right with you, I'll give you some personal history." "That's, that's fine." I had to go back to my grand school years. I was in philosophy at Princeton writing my doctorate on the incompatibility between Nietzsche's ideas on determinism and his spousal of self transformation. But I couldn't finish. I kept getting distracted by such things as Nietzsche's extraordinary correspondents especially by his letters. The friends and the fellow writers like Strindberg. And honestly, I lost interest all together in his philosophy and valued him more as an artist. I came to understand he was a poet with the most powerful voice in history, a voice so much as this, and equips the ideas. And soon there was nothing for me to do but to switch departments and do my doctorate in literature rather than philosophy. The years went by, my research progress well but I could not write my dissertation. Finally, I arrived at the position that was only through art that an artist could be illuminated. And I abandoned the dissertation project entirely and decided instead to write a novel on Nietzsche. But the writing block was not confused by the changing projects. They remained as unmovable as a granite molten. No progress is possible and so it has continued until this very day. I was stunned. Paul is 85. He must begin working on his dissertation in his 20s, 60 years ago. I had heard a professional students before but, but 60 years, his life on hold for 60 years, no, I hope not, it couldn't be. "Paul, fill me in about your life since those college days how much it could tell." "Of course, the university decided, I'd stayed overtime, ring the bell, terminated my student status but books were in my blood and I never strayed for it and I got a job as a librarian in a state university where I stayed put until determined trying unsuccessfully to write all of those years, that's it. That's my life, period." "Tell me more, your family, the people in your life." Paul seemed impatient and span out his words quickly, "No siblings, married twice, divorced twice, mercifully short marriages, no children, thank God." This was getting very odd. So affable at first, Paul now seems intent on giving me as little information as possible. What's going on? I persevered. "Your plan was to write a novel about Nietzsche and your mail-- and your email mentioned you had read my novel, When Nietzsche Wept. Can you say more about that?" "I don't understand your question," he said. "What feelings do you have about my novel?" He said, "A bit slow going at first, but it gathered staying despite this tilted language and the stylized and the probable dialogue. It was overall not an unengrossing read." "No, no, what I meant was your reaction to that novel appearing while you yourself were striving to write a novel about Nietzsche. "Some feelings about that. It must have a reason." Paul shook his head and flicked his fingers as though he didn't wanna be bothered with that question. Not knowing what else to do, I persevered. "Tell me, how did you get to me? Was my novel the reason you selected me for consultation?" Paul, "Well whatever the reason, we're here now." Things grew stranger by the minute, I thought. But if I'm to offer a decent consultation, I absolutely have to learn more about him. I turned to all reliable, a question that never fails to provide heaps of information. "I need to know more about you, Paul. I think it would help our work today if you take me in detail through a typical 24-hour day in your life. Pick a day earlier this day. Let's start with your waking in the morning." In invariably ask this question in a consultation. It provides invaluable information about so many areas to the patient's life, sleep, dreams, eating, work habits, but most of all, it helps me know how a person in his life has peopled. But failing to share my investigative enthusiasm, Paul merrily shook his head like this and have flicked my question away. "There's something more important for us to discuss. For many years, I had a long correspondence with my dissertation director, Professor Claude Muller. You know his work?" "Yes, I'm familiar with his biography as Nietzsche. He's quite wonderful." "Good. Very good." "I'm exceptionally glad that you think that," Paul said as he reached into his briefcase and extracted a ponderous binder. "Well, I brought this correspondence between him and me and I like you to read it." "When? You mean, now?" He says, "Yes, there's nothing more important than we can do in this consultation." I looked at my watch, "But we've only got this consult-- this one session that will take an hour or two." "Ah, this is so much more important that we-- Dr. Yalom, trust me, I know what I'm asking. Make a start, please." I was flummoxed. What to do? He's absolutely determined. I've reminded him our time restraints. He's fully aware he is only this one meeting. Now on the other hand perhaps Paul knows what he's doing. Perhaps he believes his correspondence will provide all the information about him that I need. Yes, yes, the more I think about, the more certain I am. And that must be it. What a relief to see some clarifying pattern. "Paul, I gathered that you're saying this correspondence provides a necessary information about you." Paul says, "If that assumption is necessary for you to read it, then the answer is yes." The most unusual and intimate dialogue is my profession, my home territory, it's where I'm always comfortable. And now in this dialogue everything feels askew, out of joint. Maybe I should stop trying so hard and just go with the flow. I've told his hour, he's paid me for my time. I felt a bit dizzy but acquiesced and held out my hand to accept the manuscript he proffered. Paul handed me this massive three-ring binder. He told me the correspondence began 50 years ago and ended with Professor Muller's death 15 years ago. I began flipping the pages to familiarize myself with the project much year ago I began flipping he pages to familiarize myself with the project, much care going into this binder. Paul had saved, indexed, dated everything that passed between them, both short casual notes and long discursive letters. Professor Muller's letters were neatly typed with his small exquisitely fashioned signature at the end of each. Well Paul's letters, the early carb-- carbon copies, the later photocopies, simply ended with the letter P. Paul nodded towards me, "Please start." I read the first several letters and saw that this was a most urbane and engaging correspondence that Paul for Mr. Muller obviously had great respect for Paul so he chided him for his infatuation with the word play. In his first letter he said, "I see that you're in love with words, Mr. Andrews. You enjoyed waltzing with them. But words are just notes. It's the ideas to form the melodies. It's the ideas that give our life structure." "I plead guilty," retorted Paul in the next letter, "I don't ingest to metabolize words. I love to dance with them. I hope always to be guilty of this offense." A few letters later despite the roles and they have sent to be seeing them, they had dropped the formal title of Mr. and professor and use of first names, Paul and Claude. In another letter, my eye felt upon an important statement written by Paul. I never fail to perplex my companions. So I had company. That felt heartening. The letter continued. Hence, I should always embrace solitude. I know I make the error of assuming that others share my passion for great words. I know I inflict my passion into them. You can only imagine how often sea creatures plea and scatter when I approach them. That sounds important I thought. Embracing solitude is a nice cosmetic touch and puts a poetic spin on this. But I imagine he's a very long milled man. Then a couple of minutes later, a couple of letters later, I had an "uh-huh" experience when I came upon a passage that are for the key to understanding this entire surreal consultation. Paul wrote, "So you see, Claude, what's left for me to do, there's nothing left for me to do, but to look for the nimblest and noblest mind I can find. I need a mind that can appreciate my sensibilities, my love of poetry, a mind incisive and bold enough to join me in dialogue. Do any of my words quicken your pulse, Claude? I need a light-footed partner for this dance. May I have the honor?" I thunderclap of understanding burst to my mind. Now, I knew why Paul insists that I read this correspondence. It's so obvious. How can I missed it? Professor Muller died 10 to 15 years ago and Paul is now trolling for another day dance partner. That's where my novel about Nietzsche comes in. No wonder I was confused. I thought I was interviewing him. In reality, he's interviewing me. That must be it was going on. I'd looked at the ceiling for a moment wondering how I could express this insight when Paul interrupted my reverie about pointing to his watch. "Please, Dr. Yalom, my time passes. Please continue reading." I followed his wishes. The letters were compelling, I dived back into them. In the first dozen letters, those seemed to clear student-teacher relationship. Claude suggested assignments like-- Claude suggested assignments, "Paul, I want you to write a piece on comparing Nietzsche's misogyny or Strindberg's misogyny." I assume Paul completed the assignments so he's not further mentioned them in the correspondence. They must have talked about them face to face. And then halfway through the first year, the teacher-student roles dissolved. No further mention of assignments. It was difficult to discern who is the teacher and who is the pupil. Claude began submitting several of his own poems seeking Paul's commentary and Paul's responses for anything but differential as he urge Claude to turn off his intellect and pay attention to his inner rush of feelings. Claude on the other hand critique Paul's poems for having formed but no content. Their relationship grew more intimate and more intense with each exchange of letters. I wondered if I held in my hands the ashes of the great love perhaps the only love of Paul's life. Maybe Paul was suffering from chronic unresolved grief. Yes, yes, that must be it. That's what he's trying to tell me by asking me to read these letters to the dead. As time went by, I offered him one hypothesis after the other but none offered the full explanation. The more I read, the more my questions multiply. Why had Paul came to-- come to see me? He labels out writing block as his major problem, why does he show no interest whatsoever in exploring his writing block? Why does he refuse to give me details of his life? And why does he insisted in spending all my time reading these letters of long ago? I needed to make sense of this. We needed to make sense of it. A resolved approach to all these issues with Paul before we parted. Then I saw a little exchange of letters, he gave me a pause. "Paul, your excessive glorification of sheer experience is veering in the danger's direction. I must remind you once again of Socrates' plea that the unexamined life is not worth living." "Good going, Claude," I rooted, "my point exactly. I identified you pressing Paul to examine his life." But Paul retorted sharply in his next letter. "Given the choice between living and examining, I'll choose living any day. I assume a melody of explanation and I urge you to do likewise. The drive to explain is an epidemic in modern thought and its major carriers are contemporary therapist. Every shrink I've ever seen suffers from this melody and its distinctive and contagious. Explanation is an illusion, a mirage, a construct, a soothing lullaby. Explanation has no existence. Let's call it by its proper name. A coward's defense against the white knuckled knee knocking terror of the precariousness, indifference and capriciousness of sheer existence. I reread this passage a second and third time. A coward's defense against the white knuckle knee knocking terror of the indifference and capriciousness of sheer existence. I began to feel undis-- de-- destabilized. My result had deposited any of the ideas from any of my mine waiver it. There was a zero chance that Paul would accept my invitation to dance. Every once and a while I looked up and so Paul's eyes riveted on me taking on my every reaction signaling me to go on to reading. But finally, there only 10 minutes left. I took charge. I close the folder and said to him, "Paul, we've little time left and I've several things to discuss to you, uncountable. We're getting to the close of this session, I've not really re-- addressed the very reason you contacted me. Your major complaint, your writing block." "I never said that." "But in your email to me, you said, here, I have it printed out." I opened my folder but before I could locate it, Paul responded, "I know my words. I would like a consultation. I've read your novel When Nietzsche Wept and wondered if you'd be willing to see a fellow writer with a writing block." I looked up at him expecting a grin, but he was entirely serious. He had said he had a writing block but had not labeled it is a problem from which he wanted the help. It was word trap and I fought, fought back irritation being trifled with. I said, "I'm accustomed to helping folks with problems, that's what therapist can do. You can-- so you can-- so one can easily see why I made that assumption." He said, "I understand entirely." "Well then, let's make a fresh start. Tell me, how can I be of help to you?" He says, "Your reflections on the correspondence. Can you be more explicit?" You hope you frame my comments. Any and every obs-- observation would be most helpful to you. It could help-- most helpful to me. All right. I opened the notebook and I took through my pages-- through the pages, "As you know, I timed to read only small portion, but overall I was captivated by it, Paul, and found it brimming with intelligence that you audition at the highest level. I was struck by the shift of roles. First toward the student and he the teacher. But obviously, a very, very special student. And within a few months, this young student and this renowned professor corresponded as equal. There's no doubt that he had the greatest respect for your comments and your judgments. He admired your pros, value your critique of his work. I can only imagine the time and energy he gave to you must have far exceeded when he could have provided the typical student. And of course, given the correspond-- given the correspondence continued long after your tenure as a student, there is no doubt that you and he were immensely important to one another." I looked at Paul. He sat emotionless, his eyes brimming with tears. He eagerly drinking in all that I said obviously thirsting for yet more. "Finally, finally, we had had an encounter. Finally, I'd given them something." I could bear witness to an event of extraordinary importance to Paul. I and I alone could testify that a great man deemed Paul to be significant. But the great man had died years ago and Paul had grown too frail to bare this fact alone. He needed a witness, somewhat of stature, and I had been selected to fill, fill that role. Yes, I had no doubt of this, this aroma, this explanation had the aroma of truth. I would stick-- I state my reputation on it. Not to convey some of these thoughts that would be of value to Paul. As I look back in all of my many insights I was uncertain where to begin. I ultimately decided to start with the most important. "Paul, what struck me most strongly about your correspondence was the intensity and the tenderness of your bond between you and Professor Muller. It struck me as a deep love. His death must have been terrible for you. I wonder that pain for loss still lingers and that is the reason you desire the consultation. What do you think?" Paul did not answer, instead he held out his hand for the manuscript and I returned it for him. He opened his briefcase, back the binder of the correspondence weigh in, separated it. "Am I right, Paul?" "Well, I desired a consultation with you because I desired it. And now I've had the consultation and I obtained precisely what I wished for. You've been helpful, exceedingly helpful. I expected nothing less. Thank you." "Before you leave, Paul, for one moment, I've always found it important to understand what helps. Can you expound for a moment of what you received from me. I think some greater clarification of this will serve you well in the future. It might be useful for me and my, my future clients." "Irv, I regret having to leave you with so many riddles but I'm afraid our time is up."
