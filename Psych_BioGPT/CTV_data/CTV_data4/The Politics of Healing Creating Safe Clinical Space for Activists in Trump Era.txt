Political depression VS. personal depression 

00:00:10
VANESSA JACKSON Hi I am Vanessa Jackson, I'm a therapist and private practitioner in Atlanta, Georgia. And co-editor of the book celled "Understanding Power, a Human Services Imperative." In that book I talk about my form of therapy, which is power based therapy and one of the things I do at my practice is I work with lot of activist 'cause I consider myself as an activist therapist and one thing really important to me especially in the time of so much political change. And light of our recent election that has lot of people and a lot of distress. But also means that the work of people who are working for social justice umm… they work has got lot more complicated and those people may be showing up in offices needing additional support, needing new tools to handle these… these were really turbulent times and I'm wanna make sure that therapist has the tools that they need to serve this population and so one of the things I like to talk about with activist is the ways they have to both manage their personal life and their feelings and life circumstances that anyone has to deal with. Alongside the added pressures of try to take on the big role of transforming society of working for social justice and political change and sometimes those things clash and people are trying to separate out what's their political depression and their personal depression uh… what to do with sense of overwhelm, and outrage, and sadness that comes with finding umm… the causes that are due to your heart. Whether that looking at issues around, reproductive justice or uh… black liberation uh… looking at issues around people umm… who have always been marginalized really fighting for change and that its our job as therapist to work alongside them to give that's swath their need. So they can continue to stay in this struggle because uh… they just really so much it's happening umm… in our world and I wanna make sure that as a therapist I'm listening and tracking their stories, as well as understanding the context 'cause I think sometimes people can quit the a job but when you're an activist and you are dealing with issues that are very life threatening, when the Queer Community's under attack that is both a personal issue as well as a political issue and so we have to able to, to work and meet our clients and be a support for them. And so one other things that I like to talk about with my clients is really making sure that they understand the political, context in which they're working in and how their own emotional well being is impacted by that and so sometimes people come in and their talking about what feels like very run of the meal kind of situation's of partners and children and finances and then other times they are coming in and they are need to be brief that they were involved in direct actions which may have been very life threatening and what that means for them and you had also no way that they have to go right back out to that struggle and it's not like a job they can walk away from its who they are, it's what's important for them and it's an ongoing struggle which has gotten a lot more complicated as a late. And so I wanna be able to talk about some of the ways that power based therapy, and helping people understand both their personal power and larger political forces that impinge upon their ability to operate with power uh… can be addressed in a clinical setting.

Introduction to Counseling Session 

00:03:55
VANESSA JACKSON Uh… next I'm gonna meet the young activist who is trying to negotiate their life both partnership, children and also dealing with day to day struggles of doing work that has got exponently more difficult with the our new administration, and really having a process uh… what she feeling and also had to be vulnerable because things that have real expectations with activist that it's so often they are out fighting oppression facing down difficult situations that the places of vulnerability are not always have given the opportunity for expression, and so one of the things I always have to think about when I'm working with activists is how they can be in build their strength and power but also in there vulnerability because one thing that I tell to people is that when we win, and I believe it's a when we win is that we also have to fit live next door to, and that we also need to be able and have a right to enjoy loved ones and fun and laughter, and addition to the very serious work of social change. 

00:05:00

Strength and power VS. vulnerability 

00:05:05
VANESSA JACKSON Hai Maureen, how you, how you doing today? 

00:05:05
MAUREEN I'm okay, how are you? 

00:05:10
VANESSA JACKSON I'm just fine, I just wanna see where you wanna start today. 

00:05:15
MAUREEN Oh… it could go many ways, umm… just a lot going on in the world right now and bigger world than my personal life and it's just, you know, managing both. 

00:05:25
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, so and the part of it is like how do you deal with the bigger world and especially, as an activist. There's a lot going on and one thing I been checking on in the people since the election is how they doing personally, how they doing politically and so let's keep it on the personal in first around like what's going on and how you are process it? 

00:05:45
MAUREEN Well, personally, umm… things that have kind of overflow into the personal life getting up every day into this climendous atmosphere that we live in and umm… you know, two kids, raising two kids and maintaining the relationship umm… its just been really difficult to balance all this different roles. 

00:06:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, what's been the hardest part for you? Unless let's try to stay focused on the, you know, yet, this big work in the world, you know, trying to bring back change and you got family and umm… your own sadness I think it's that, when I am hearing sad. 

00:06:20
MAUREEN Yes, And finding time to create energy for those areas of life like energy to be present, a home. 

00:06:30
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, so tell me how it's happening now? 

00:06:35
MAUREEN Just tired, very tired when I get home. very tired for the roles that I feel like I'm poring because I'm giving so much of myself away somewhere else. 

00:06:45
VANESSA JACKSON So because you got children and you're doing that piece and you're tired, I wanna make sure we are T's on tired 'cause tired can be I'm physically exhausted, I can I'm emotionally exhausted, I'm spiritually exhausted. I'm so depressed that I don't wanna get out of my bed. 

00:07:00
MAUREEN Right. 

00:07:00
VANESSA JACKSON So I wanna sort of tease apart which ones of those might be present now, so they were working on the right thing. 

00:07:10
MAUREEN I think I'm filling more like the last part it's getting difficult to do the basic things like get out of bed and laundry and cooking and, you know, attending to all those. 

00:07:20
VANESSA JACKSON So, so here is a thing when I think about that so one is just a lot of, and so describe to me what that feels like, so you say it's hard to get up but umm… what does it show up consistently, has it been sort of a certain things happened since the election or is it something that was in place before? 

00:07:40
MAUREEN You know, that's the good question, I think its, it show that before but not to this magnitude. There is a sense of hopelessness and little helplessness. 

00:07:50
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:07:50
MAUREEN Umm… and it's probably taken away from the drive, a little bit. 

00:07:55
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, and, and let me do us into another little check because one of it and then I'm glad, it's really important to sort of name what's going on and try to track… 

00:08:05
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:08:05
VANESSA JACKSON When it started and some of it was already in place and then it sort of like the air get sucked out of the room and you've gotta reposition and I suspect your work just got a whole lot of harder. 

00:08:15
MAUREEN It did and it does for it like gotten worse since, you know, post election because those, there was a climate that was already present and then this feels already was difficult but now it feels like uh… almost like… not almost, lost. You know, its like… almost feel like, kind of all this work has been torn down then we have to like start back up at this lower level and its… I think it's kind of feed in that exhaustion of like are we even gonna get there? 

00:08:45
VANESSA JACKSON Is that something like its both helplessness and hopelessness and then the sea, a big piece of your work felt torned down. 

00:08:50
MAUREEN Yeah, yeah. 

00:08:55
VANESSA JACKSON And I wanna just check with, when… with your, with your comrades and with the person that you're co-workers, is there a way that you're all talking about it at all? 

00:09:05
Social media considerations 

00:09:05
MAUREEN You know, there are some conversations but I'll find myself feeling very removed from them umm… just even with the Facebook post or like just, you know, though I'll try myself, of course not associate with people that are now in the same wavelength but even the one's that are, there is a lot of negativity, although it's a lot of focus and energy been poured into it, you know. 

00:09:25
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, and so you had been able to back off a bit, until you're… you're monitoring what comes in, because one of the things that I think it's really important, you said, you're noticing the fatigue and so that sort of like uh… a alarm that maybe I'm getting too much of (inaudible ) this toxic stuff coming in and even though its your work as an activist, its really okay to turn away like… you've got enough data. 

00:09:50
MAUREEN That's been hard though. 

00:09:50
VANESSA JACKSON Tell me about that. 

00:09:55
MAUREEN Oh, it like affecting identity a little bit because I want to back off of something I feel like I should be, like… I am passionate about it but I'm also feeling those triggers that you're mention and I was like stepping back and its like challenging. 

00:10:10
Discussion of "triggers" 

00:10:10
VANESSA JACKSON You used a word that I think is really important as we talk about this, about how you take care of yourself? It's a trigger. And so when it's a trigger, we want to take that seriously that it because what the trigger does it sort of sends the ripple of emotional explosion or a sort of depresses your energy and if it's a trigger, its okay to make a decision not to step on it. And because you are… you have enough information already that there is pry something, that is depressing and demoralize happening… 

00:10:40
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:10:45
VANESSA JACKSON Whether we're looking at FaceBook or the news or not. 

00:10:45
MAUREEN Right. 

00:10:45
VANESSA JACKSON And so in order to, to manage your energy and manage you're umm… and sort of protect your vision, it's, it's gonna be important sometimes to pull out. And yet, you acknowledge that it's hard to look away. 

00:11:00
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:11:00
VANESSA JACKSON And it's also, for some people it can be a connector… 

00:11:05
MAUREEN Yes. 

00:11:05
VANESSA JACKSON Like my people, in the end but then it, it sort of keeps you sad and hopeless. 

00:11:10
MAUREEN That's exactly what's happening. 

00:11:15
Creating permission to "unplug" on social media 

00:11:15
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, so one of the things that I'm gonna sort of invite you to do and it… it might sound really hard encountering intuitive and maybe like I don't feel like I'm a good activist uh… is to be able to some pulling out and umm… whether that's a day or week, where you don't like uh… I personally decide that on the weekends, I'm out looking at FaceBook because I look at all that stuff that riffs me up. What would it be like to sort of give yourself permission to unplug? Like what… really what does that do for you? 

00:11:45
MAUREEN It sounds lovely and difficult. 

00:11:50
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, well, So let's talk about the difficult part of it. 

00:11:55
MAUREEN Umm… difficult because when I step back into that umm… field or group of people that have been doing those things and I don't wanna say I'm not up to date but we discuss and maybe "Hey, did you watch this or you aware of that or Oh my God did you guys followed this and…" I don't know what it'll be like for me to I don't have to say it aloud but to even say it aloud there I'm choosing to not go there. 

00:12:20
VANESSA JACKSON What if you said, let's, let's imagine that you said… 

00:12:25
MAUREEN Ha… 

00:12:25
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, you just had a full body reaction. What… the thought of not of just saying in an effort to take care of myself and be in this for the long halt. I'm choosing to take some breaks. I'm choosing like respite it's the word that comes to my mind for me. So that I can do the work I needed to do umm… as part of activism but also the care of feeding on my own life that I don't want to get caught up in the shock and all. So let's go back to thinking that you're with the crew and there is… they're talking about something that was TV, whatever, and you said "I'm taking a break", what, what does that feel like to say I'm claiming the right umm… to sort of shut this down and not step on the trigger. 

00:13:15
MAUREEN It feels good. I think I would get support from some and I think I'll make a little bit of umm… and even a verbal backlash but just maybe my own thoughts about some people's ideas about me saying something like that umm… 

00:13:25
VANESSA JACKSON So, who's judging who here? What about your own judgment? 

00:13:30
MAUREEN Yeah, I think its mostly me. 

00:13:30
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:13:30
MAUREEN It's mostly me. 

00:13:35
VANESSA JACKSON So what would it take for you to say I know that there is a lot of important thing happening, I know that we're creating a lot of strategies, I know that we gotta constantly be out on the streets and processing all this information and my, my brain and my spirit can only take so much. And so I'm going in order to be effective for the long halt, me as to manage my energy really strategically. 

00:14:05
MAUREEN Yeah. You know, it may even be a positive modular enforce for some 'cause I think we all need it. Yeah. Really, really hard on ourselves. 

00:14:15
VANESSA JACKSON And so the courage then so, so there is a little piece of courage about being the one that says, we know that there's a lot of stuff going on but let's, let's also take care of ourselves and, and, you know, we talk about self care as a revolutionary act and that's just not, you know, Minnie's and Petty's and… which are not bad, I ain't saying but uh… but also like, how I take in information. 

00:14:35
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:14:40
VANESSA JACKSON That's overwhelming and I'll have a right to stop. 

00:14:40
MAUREEN That's true. 

00:14:40
VANESSA JACKSON When I'm feeling overwhelmed to try to move out of it so that I can go back to planning and strategizing. 

00:14:45
MAUREEN Yeah, that's kind of like been in the space because I… like I said, I've been doing some of that already, it's just I hadn't reconciled that guilty pieces about it. It did feel good to just like to be in a different place. 

00:15:00
VANESSA JACKSON So you can do it on the low? 

00:15:00
MAUREEN On the low. 

00:15:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, so basically, so what if you brought it forward as a, as a, as a piece of your work. 

00:15:05
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:15:10
VANESSA JACKSON And as you said, also as a model because everybody gets some permission to take care of themselves in the ways that are important to them. 

00:15:15
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:15:20
VANESSA JACKSON So if you have like the courage, in a fact, to sort of stand up and say like I, I needed to do something different, I needed a moment, I needed to go out to nature, I need to play with my children, I need to like watch a movie that's like light. Umm… read a book that's easy in order to sort of clean my brain out for a second. 

00:15:40
MAUREEN Yeah, it's been feeling like one to create a different reality that's not so depressing and stressful and intense, all the time, you know. And finding a way to look at my kids in that, worry so much about the world they're growing up in and just watching them be kids and be there them. 

00:15:55
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, so you think about the moments where, you know, you have to have the kind of it's always a dual conscious about the bigger world that you're trying to create umm… that's safer for them and also just the moment to moment, when you think about the moments when you are most at peace as you kids about you're kids. What's going on? 

00:16:15
[sil.] 

00:16:20
MAUREEN Just calmness. 

00:16:20
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, yeah, are they in your lap, are they… are you playing a game or is there something that, the thing that brings you peace with you children. 

00:16:25
MAUREEN No, no. They are laughing… 

00:16:30
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. 

00:16:30
MAUREEN In any moment, we're just really connected and just carefree. 

00:16:35
VANESSA JACKSON Okay. So and so you have those moments and you want more of those moments, right? And so what happens when you think about those moments and then the whole sort of tsunami of oppression but don't you need those moments of peace to help you, prepare to do… 

00:16:50
MAUREEN They are very fueling its very, very much fuel to the fire. 

00:16:55
Linking family to activism 

00:16:55
VANESSA JACKSON Okay and so how do you sort of keep it to the centered? They're, they are the fuel to your activist fire you're children? Okay, and I think that's really important 'cause I was gonna ask you that in these times, its really important to kind of ground your self like why am I, why am I doing this. 

00:17:10
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:17:15
VANESSA JACKSON Like the big why's, its really important and so I'm doing it 'cause I want a better world for my kids and other people's kids… 

00:17:20
MAUREEN And other people's kids, yes. 

00:17:25
VANESSA JACKSON And while we making this world that's good for everybody's kids, right. It's okay for you to enjoy your kids? 

00:17:25
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:17:30
VANESSA JACKSON Guilt free. 

00:17:30
MAUREEN Guilt free. 

00:17:35
VANESSA JACKSON So, that's what happens, you get kind of caught up in how, you know, I'm having this moment with my kids and there's someone over there whose kids are maybe having a harder time. 

00:17:40
MAUREEN Exactly. 

00:17:40
VANESSA JACKSON But not being you're kids doesn't help their kids. Does that makes sense? 

00:17:45
MAUREEN Yeah, it does. 

00:17:45
VANESSA JACKSON So the permission to sort of be in your joy as part of your fuel 'cause it's not like as an activist, you can quit your job like if you don't like your job in corporate America, you can quit. 

00:18:00
MAUREEN It's not even like that. 

00:18:05
VANESSA JACKSON It's not like that, its who you are, right? And so how do you have a piece of who you are that, in this moment especially, as you said it's like all your work… has feeling, its been destroyed and then realizing the rebuild's gonna take a lot of energy and its not going to be fast. So how do you protect hope like we have to figure out like where if we had those sort of things, I mean, like what hope doing right now? Is it under the covers? Is it in the streets, like where is your hope, right now? 

00:18:40
MAUREEN If I was to turn hope into a person. 

00:18:40
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, let's make hope a person, what's hope is doing right now? 

00:18:45
MAUREEN Where my concept of hope would be definitely not in gym, it's not working out, it's not building muscle. 

00:18:50
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, okay. So what's hope doing right now? Listen while it, what is your hope doing right now? As we know that hope has got to be… 

00:18:55
MAUREEN On the Callous eating ice cream. 

00:19:00
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, Looking for comfort? 

00:19:00
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:19:00
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, so think about then what hope would need to be able to get off the couch but I think it's okay to say that's where hope is because… she's feeling under threat, she's feeling under stress and I think it's important to acknowledge that 'cause we can't act like, you know, I'm supposed to be a warrior, I'm tough, I'm up in it. 

00:19:25
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:19:25
VANESSA JACKSON And that's true and at the same time, I'm on the couch with the ice cream because it's overwhelming. 

00:19:30
MAUREEN Yes. 

00:19:30
VANESSA JACKSON So looking at hope, what do you think she needs to get off the couch? Or does she need to be on the couch for a hot ticket? 

00:19:40
MAUREEN Well, she's on the couch but when she steps out, she pretends like she hasn't been on the couch eating ice cream so just a little dose of honesty. 

00:19:55
VANESSA JACKSON Who does she need to tell that some days I'm so overwhelmed that I'm on the couch 'cause as you said because people see the warrior and yet, no one sees the part that really is feeling exhausted. 

00:20:10
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:20:15
VANESSA JACKSON So who could you tell about the times when you come home and you're on the couch? And do you think you're the only one in your group that is feeling that way? 

00:20:25
MAUREEN That's true. I think it started with a little bit of uh… telling that to self and not to believe even in that front stepping out the door and forgetting about that couch moment till I get back on the couch. 

00:20:40
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, couch woman. 

00:20:40
MAUREEN Couch woman, yeah, but outside it's like Warrior Woman and not matching the two but… 

00:20:45
VANESSA JACKSON And who's things, there aspects and so and there would maybe a way that couch woman does help the warrior… 

00:20:55
MAUREEN That's true. 

00:20:55
VANESSA JACKSON Because she doesn't fake the funk that she's not exhausted and feeling overwhelmed. 

00:21:00
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:21:05
VANESSA JACKSON So how do you bring that honest piece of yourself into your work and into umm… the daily life of your activism? 

00:21:15
MAUREEN I think it'll be very powerful verbalize that and express that out loud to some people that I may have created a conception that would like to have this judgment and maybe possibly have a moment of connecting around that, in feeling supported in that that would feel amazing. 

00:21:35
VANESSA JACKSON So, it's possible that the progressive tribunal wouldn't throw rocks at you. If you came and said "There's just days, when I just wanna stay on the couch." 

00:21:45
MAUREEN I will feel amazing. 

00:21:45
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, so and you think about the people that are in your day to day world, who are doing this work with you, can you think of one person that you would, would, would take the risk and act and sometimes offer them the gift of your truth. 

00:22:00
In this next segment, Vanessa summarizes the session with Maureen and works on strategies for her feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and burnout 

00:22:10
VANESSA JACKSON So, so really so we've got somebody that you thought about, you know, we sort of named some the problem and now we're looking at some strategy about the willingness to take the risk with to share it with your friends. Umm… and so it's okay to be a political badass and still need love and support, encouragement and you could also offer to your friend, so you think about how you wanna talk to Susan about this? 

00:22:35
MAUREEN Yeah, I think that would be a good umm… transition into our friendship and good beneficial thing for both of us. 

00:22:45
VANESSA JACKSON You need it. 

00:22:45
MAUREEN Yeah, I think I'm going to Hawaiian. 

00:22:45
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, say one. 

00:22:50
MAUREEN Just creative relaxed atmosphere. I'm thinking a home. 

00:22:55
VANESSA JACKSON I'm going to invite you to do this little differently. 

00:22:55
MAUREEN Really? 

00:22:55
VANESSA JACKSON Think about it… 

00:23:00
MAUREEN Okay. 

00:23:00
VANESSA JACKSON And I'm going to ask you to pull a courage. I want to invite you to do it, at work say more… 

00:23:05
MAUREEN So, you wanna make it at home. 

00:23:10
VANESSA JACKSON Let me tell you why I am being deliberate about that? 'Cause you're gonna need to bring this energy into your workspace, you're going to bring it into organizing spaces, you're gonna bring it while you're standing on lines, why you're in the streets, when your on plains places and so we really need to show umm… the same kind of fearlessness that I know you show every day in your work. When you're face and, you know, legislation face if you're doing all this work is that. This vulnerability is going to be one your greatest act of courage and so I do want to invite you to not umm… dilute it. By being Aldrich day take it for starters and the other part of it is to say speak your truth with power. 

00:24:00
MAUREEN yeah, that is good that was the first thought. 

00:24:00
VANESSA JACKSON I, I… you were gonna coming out and I was gonna let you for a half second but then it occurred to me that it really is something that has to be integrated into movement work. 

00:24:10
MAUREEN That would definitely feel different. 

00:24:15
VANESSA JACKSON And, and I know I'm asking a tough thing and I one of things that I love on a national level, seeing our movement leaders especially black lives matters specially I see it, As modeling, that we have a full range of feelings like that's really politically harmful that we have a right to have a full range of feelings, strength, vulnerability sadness, rage and that we could do it with clear heads. 

00:24:40
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:24:45
VANESSA JACKSON Okay so now thinking about doing that what's it feels like. 

00:24:50
MAUREEN A little different but… 

00:24:50
VANESSA JACKSON In what way. 

00:24:55
MAUREEN … It feels different because I was picturing myself of already like, you know, in my own space and kind of like in control of how I wanted to go what we say and. 

00:25:05
VANESSA JACKSON Okay So I'm so glad that you're offering this up with so many channels, I really do. Because then it's like because again I get the sense for you want to be in control you want to feel safe and secure and that's why I'm pushing you to take more risks with it. 

00:25:20
MAUREEN Yeah… 

00:25:25
VANESSA JACKSON Because when you're gonna need it most, especially as we go on we're in this for the long haul and if you're going to do this on the ground in motion pain management and you're not always going to have the luxury of constructing an environment that's completely safe. 

00:25:40
MAUREEN Yeah, and that's also part of the goal of doing this is to be able to be vulnerable because I feel like I work on like what if I go higher what if I get emotional but that's the goal right. 

00:25:55
VANESSA JACKSON So I just, it just is and so the piece of it is that you know the right to live into not to performing get rigid. This is the thing about oppression and especially as which is that it's useful for people to get us locked into ways of being where we're not flexible, the truth of it is as human beings, we have a range of emotions and you'd becoming an actress, she don't turn in that right, you know, turn over that right to have a full range of emotions and so it's like, you've got to show them all your stuff. And you've got to trust. 

00:26:30
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:26:30
VANESSA JACKSON You gotta trust that your comrades are gonna be there for you and sometimes even say it's okay, take a break. Like why don't you take a weekend, we got this. 

00:26:40
MAUREEN Yeah, that's true. And it's like more than likely this, what will happen. 

00:26:50
VANESSA JACKSON If I, when has it already happened even though they maybe had to wrestle you to ground to say Go away… 

00:26:55
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:26:55
VANESSA JACKSON We got this. 

00:26:55
MAUREEN Yeah, it's me. It's mostly me. 

00:27:00
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, and so the thing of it as you can trust you and you can trust you, you're… you're comrades and you can trust the movement. Uh… because I think especially with this new level of intensity, it's so easy to get caught in overwhelm… 

00:27:15
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:27:20
VANESSA JACKSON And so we want… we were at risk for burning out because every day there's a new assault. 

00:27:20
MAUREEN Absolutely. 

00:27:25
VANESSA JACKSON And on, on things that we hold dear, that are so important and so we've got a pace ourselves and that means sometimes pulling out of things and trusting, it really does mean trusting someone else is gonna cover it and someday you're going to cover for them. 

00:27:40
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:27:40
VANESSA JACKSON So we gotta take care of ourselves and take care of the people that are walking alongside us and then this, this is the need to sort of play and come home and, you know, you play it with your kid. 

00:27:55
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:27:55
VANESSA JACKSON Because you need to shift out of it, and so that's really and what you've noticed in talking about this, is it's really getting out of your own head and your own judgments about it, that's really what you're saying is that's not what activists do. 

00:28:10
MAUREEN Right. 

00:28:15
VANESSA JACKSON So your own image… 

00:28:15
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:28:15
VANESSA JACKSON About what activist do and don't do. 

00:28:15
MAUREEN Right. 

00:28:20
VANESSA JACKSON Is, is getting in the way it is. 

00:28:20
MAUREEN It is. And that's again in a way of the, the time that I am creating because I'm still watching myself from that angle. 

00:28:25
VANESSA JACKSON Oh, you're judging. Let's call… you not just watching, you're like a full blown judge. 

00:28:30
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:28:30
VANESSA JACKSON So 'cause if you do the thing of it, is we saw them asking to be sort of intentional because otherwise, what will happen is that you will run yourself to place of exhaustion that you're getting to crisis and then you wanna run away or you're just being capacitated and I don't think that serves the movement. 

00:28:45
MAUREEN That's true. 

00:28:50
VANESSA JACKSON Is that, you know, we've got to take care of ourselves and so, you know, no sense of waiting till your fully on fire. Although most of us are kind of smoky right now. 

00:29:00
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:29:00
VANESSA JACKSON And so in the service of your commitment to the issues that are important to you. Taking care of yourself means you're available for work. And it also means that when we win, we're fit to live next torture 'cause if you burn yourself out you become a warrior as all you know… who wants to be a neighbor with someone that's constantly on alert? How do you then, you know, the playground gets to be a fraud place? You know with someone who's in the midst of a lot of judgments or feeling that they can never let down their guard. So this is a piece, so as you think about how you're gonna take care of yourself and I love the fact that you, you are always going back and forth, as good activists do, about like what benefit is my work to the movement and I think you've already identified that I can model for people, I can show up with more my heart because your heart is what led you to it and I think again with the political climate I've been talking to people about sort of the shock and awe, like every day it's like naive, every minute it's a new awful thing. And so it's very easy uh… and it's designed to make us put the covers over head. And we've got a sort of figure out how to rise… white ride the waves of it like peach your head up, do what you need to do, we've got a lot of data about what is happening. And so it's really okay not to take in more when you know your already feeling overwhelmed but just to take care of yourself, in whatever ways it make sense and then strategize and which means you need to be emotionally flexible, you need to be creative in your, your work so. I really am asking people to umm… be deliberate about how they take time and, and, and get respect. 

00:30:55
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:30:55
VANESSA JACKSON And I had somebody come in say that that her commitment was in the face of oppression, she was going to roll with love. And I think that that in some ways we don't feel like we're in that but I think it's really important have an anchoring value to your activism, once remembering why you got into it and that these are times that are gonna test us like it's really gonna tell us who we are and what we love. 

00:31:20
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:31:20
VANESSA JACKSON So we think about, what's it gonna be you're anchoring statement and the ways that you were gonna umm… take care yourself when you feel triggered. What comes up for you as possibilities? 

00:31:35
MAUREEN I like that a love of peace, I want to take that. 

00:31:35
VANESSA JACKSON Love and peace, this is what we're trying to build, right? 

00:31:40
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:31:40
VANESSA JACKSON New world, Centered in love. 

00:31:40
MAUREEN Yeah, I like that that would, that is my passion and that's what drives me, peace and love it's not like a hippie but it's true. 

00:31:50
VANESSA JACKSON Okay, little black hippie's, we're hippies. So in, in… its all in your anchor that, so when you think about peace and love as being your anchoring point, so why you are doing this and why you show up and what you really put your life on line. Umm… and you mention before like your kids like we want this world better off with them and so that's all about love and peace, right? And so thinking about all that and now, we've moved some of the guilt out of the way that like if you step down like it all falls apart, and it's your fault… if, you know, the new president does something new and awful, it's like no, it's like what's the part that you're gonna hold a line? What's a part that you're gonna the envision something better and more meaningful that works for more people. 

00:32:35
MAUREEN Yeah, I like what you said about data. And then that's really helped me kind of process the guilt part and to know that I don't need to continue to collect these things that are already and if I step away then it's okay. 

00:32:50
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, it'll be awful and irrational and so we know that yeah and what you do is you step back and you get… you get strategic. 

00:33:00
MAUREEN I feel like I wanna schedule something right now, leaving here, to do something, with my kids this weekend. 

00:33:10
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, there grounding and bring your friends into bring them, bring the other folks like I think that's something that's really important for us because they keeps us connect with why we're doing, what we're doing 'cause it is so thankless and it so unrelenting that its gonna be so important that we find our oxygen tank. 

00:33:25
MAUREEN That's true. 

00:33:30
VANESSA JACKSON Politically what is our oxygen tank? Uh… just stay uh… grounded and ready and umm… and we could look at other movements like we, I have friends that are black liberation activists from the '60s and '70s and they have lots of wisdom to share with us, as well. 

00:33:45
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:33:45
VANESSA JACKSON And so we can look at what worked and what didn't work. 

00:33:50
MAUREEN This was how folks… 'cause I feel like there's been a lot of community building around the negativity but not enough around positivity. 

00:34:00
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, and we got do both, you gotta look at what's real and so you don't want someone to still "Oh, Geez, it's so happy", it's like… 

00:34:05
MAUREEN Right, no. 

00:34:05
VANESSA JACKSON What world is you living in? At the same time it's like finding a part that says, we understand the nature of the problem, we understand that we are losing people and people loosing things that are really sacred to them. At the same time, we hold to this vision that it can be better and that I wanna start living into some of that and sometimes, the first part of it, is living into with your child or living into it with your lover or living into your family and that's really part of our work that's important political work. 

00:34:40
MAUREEN That sounds so balancing right now. 

00:34:40
VANESSA JACKSON Yeah, and you know, and, and when you get out of balance, get back in… 

00:34:45
MAUREEN Yeah. 

00:34:45
VANESSA JACKSON But don't expect not to get out of balance. 

00:34:50
Post Session Reflection 

00:34:55
VANESSA JACKSON You know, one of the things I wanna reflect in, in this session, I think it's really important and that I see happen, it's a, it's a common theme in my work with activists is this whole issue of vulnerability because again people have to stand so guarded there, helping to organize or reaching out, they're taking care of, that very often the feelings gets lost, are their own feelings, and, and when they need support, how to let people know that they need support and so when I ask people to be vulnerable, they oftentimes is the most terrifying thing for an activist to do. But it also is really important because without that vulnerability, they won't have the flexibility that, that they need to do all of the difficult work, carry the burden of change uh… but also to share opportunities and one of things that, you know, like in this session, it was not only that this client had the opportunity to express her vulnerability because she has a right to it but that it also was an opportunity for her to show how she could use that vulnerability in the service of her movement that in her ability to be vulnerable to be open to say she has needs, to say she needs to step back for a moment that she gives other people permission because we're gonna need those spaces uh… as one as one of my clients that before like I… I wanna have a little grace and compassion. And I want to receive grace and compassion so some of the work that I do is helping people uh… practice that and oftentimes well, the answer was that maybe one of the most difficult acts that they could, could offer in the service of their movement and in the service of love.
