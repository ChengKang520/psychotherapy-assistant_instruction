00:01:25
From the beginning of life 

00:01:25
You were influenced by your DNA... 

00:01:25
PAT LOVE Yes I'm gonna talk about sex. And I basically want to give you a simplistic perspective of a very complex issue. Because couples, relationships are complex. And they're complex for a lot of reasons. When people say, “What do you do with a couple that...?” I often think, “Well it depends.” And it depends on a lot. And we know it's not just nurture or history or what we've learned that shapes us, it's also nature. And it starts with the DNA. From beginning of life, you are influenced by your DNA. And along with this DNA came a concoction of chemicals that hormones, neurotransmitters, that shape not only your behavior, it shapes who you are, what you do, it really shapes your personality, your temperament. So we know that part of the nature nurture story is what you bring to the table and what a partner brings to the table, which will influence how they are in relationships. Now we've identified well over a hundred of these hormones and neurotransmitters. But I wanna talk to you specifically about two of them. 

00:02:50
Let's look at just two of them... 

00:02:50
Estrogen Testosterone 

00:02:50
PAT LOVE And these two are testosterone and estrogen. And I want you to think about all of us, men and women alike, being on this continuum. And let's just say high testosterone is way over here and high estrogen is way over here. And depending upon where you are on this continuum, you will behave and have impulses and motivations that will defer from a person who's on another part of the continuum. And I think it's really important when we talk about difference, in general we're talking not about capacity. You can never be this way. It means what's your impulse, or your natural drive or your motivation to for example talk a lot, may or may not, by the way it is dependent upon the chemical cocktail that came with your DNA. So we wanna understand this difference when it relates to relationships because a part of keeping relationships alive and dynamic and actually passionate is honoring difference. You don't have to be about, just like me and I don't have to be just like you. This here's a big question. Can you truly love an other? An other. Another person. Can you truly understand and relate to someone who really is different than you? And this difference is gonna be largely determined by your DNA. So let's look at what we're talking about by taking a look at testosterone first. 

00:04:35
Testosterone 

00:04:35
“Let's get with it.” 

00:04:35
Sex 

00:04:35
Zest for life 

00:04:35
Drive 

00:04:35
Motivation 

00:04:35
Decreases talking 

00:04:35
Suppresses maternal behavior 

00:04:35
Decreased social interest 

00:04:35
Heightened response to anger 

00:04:35
PAT LOVE What is this have to do with how we act? Well testosterone sometimes is known as the “let's get with it” hormone. This is, yes it's related to sex. I mean your sex drive, arousal, your interest, oftentimes frequency, even it's being correlated perhaps with a number of sexual partners. It's not hard core, meaning that it doesn't predict and determine all of the partners that you might have. But statistically people with high testosterone through a lifespan have more partners. Doesn't mean we all do. Cause remember research predicts for groups better than individuals. They're always these already, you know, always these outliers. But testosterone doesn't have to do only with sex. It has to do with zest for life itself. It's really about having energy. It's that energetic drive for life. And if you've had, when testosterone goes down there is this lackluster experience that comes with not having the drive that you once had. Doesn't mean you can't get it back. Doesn't mean, it means that motivation that felt natural at one time now has to become more proactively and more on purpose. So zest for life is connected to testosterone. Also your drive. It's what propels you forward, keeps you moving, keeps you in motion. And this has to do with motivation. I mean oftentimes it's not just having a great idea, is it? It's not just having a good plan. Can you implement the plan and have the energy, the zest and the drive to complete the plan? And testosterone helps you do this. Also, this is a very interesting one. It decreases talking. If you look at two estrogen dominant individuals and you hook them up to a functional MRI and you're looking at brain activity, what you're seeing with two estrogen dominant individuals is that these two people are getting little squirts of dopamine that's giving them pleasure by talking more. They sort of get high on talking about anything. And of course the more personal it is, the more dopamine is released, and the more high they get. So we know that estrogen enhances the effects of this dopanergic response and testosterone decreases it. It's not that testosterone dominant individuals don't like talking. They just don't get high from it. And actually they'll do it when it has a purpose, when it has a reward, when it has something interesting going on. Now when you think about this continuum, cause people are saying, “Are you talking about men and women?” We're talking about on the testosterone end of this continuum. We're talking two thirds men and almost a third of women. So we're talking that dominant, yes the average man has more testosterone than the average woman. But there are millions of high testosterone women. So this not is just a gender issue, it truly is a continuum issue. And if you look at estrogen, estrogen dominant individuals, we're talking about, yes, most women, two thirds, and some men. These are the nice guys, the nurturers, the ones that are just natural caretakers. And they, by the way, like most women, get high and pleasure from talking. So it doesn't mean, so you begin to see why this understanding of the difference in just chemistry, just the DNA that you were given, can really help you understand and appreciate another person. Cause you don't take it personally when they're not talking. It also suppresses that maternal behavior, that nurturing, that natural care-giving. Does it mean high T, high testosterone people can't nurture? No. It's not about capacity. It's about motivation and impulse. Might explain why he or she doesn't naturally start taking care of everybody when you're socializing or having a party. You know, didn't you see that everybody? Well, no. Doesn't mean she or he can't learn it. But again it's not the impulse. You don't cast harm, you don't cast malintent when you begin to understand this difference. The other thing is it decreases social, socializing isn't quite as rewarding unless there's competition, unless there's a purpose, unless there's an activity, unless there's more meaning, intrinsic meaning in it. Just socializing itself is not a sport to the high T person. The other thing is this is a person who has heightened response to anger. You know testosterone gives you that ready for action response. And so these are people who are often a little bit irritable, maybe a little more aggressive, they're more comfortable with their anger, statistically cause you know men, you know if you're looking for a partner you might say, “Wow, I want a high testosterone partner.” You know, man or woman. You might say that. Be careful what you ask for. Because you better be ready to be with someone who's a little more comfortable with their anger. Okay? So now let's look at estrogen. 

00:10:30
Estrogen 

00:10:30
“Make love not war.” 

00:10:30
Imagination 

00:10:30
Creativity 

00:10:30
Insightfulness 

00:10:30
Sympathy 

00:10:30
Flexibility 

00:10:30
Verbal skills 

00:10:30
Social skills 

00:10:30
Regulates memory 

00:10:30
PAT LOVE Estrogen is more the, let's make love not war. Estrogen is the, by the way, gives you this great imagination, which is sort of good news and bad news if you've ever been in a relationship with somebody with high estrogen. Their imagination can sort of be, can run wild at times. And especially with their creativity. I mean creativity is estrogen dominant. It is, it really is fueled by estrogen. Insightfulness. It's interesting because and I think this had to do with, they looked at men and women, but I think it has to do statistically more with the hormone balance and the dominances. They gave, they showed men and women pictures of individuals in this research study with subtle, expressing subtle emotions, you know like guilt or disappointment or maybe confusion or frustration. And they found that women get it right just about 90 percent of the time. And men got the subtle emotions right about 40 percent of the time. 40. This insightfulness I think comes a lot from interpreting subtle emotions. But let me tell you where the testosterone dominant or the men really did shine, where there was threat or harm. Men got it right almost 100 percent of the time. So women, men, heads up. If you have a partner or a friend, male say, be careful about that situation. If I were you I'd heed that advice cause this insightfulness that belongs to the subtle emotions gets made up for when there's threat. Estrogen enhances sympathy or empathy and that is feeling what another person feels. You know there are two empathic systems. One's the mirror neuron system and one's the TPJ, the temporal parietal junction system, mirror neurons, they made me feel what you're feeling. The TPJ is I feel it but then I analyze and I wanna fix it. Those are two empathic systems where estrogen dominant individuals stick with that empathic system, they're more flexible, they are great at verbal skills. Do not get in an argument with an estrogen dominant person unless you are too socializing is very rewarding and it enhances memory A lot of women can relate to this and perhaps aging men who are estrogen dominant, when your estrogen goes down you get what I call CRS, can't remember stuff. You can't remember stuff. And you think, oh I'm getting old. Your estrogen's going down. By the way the antidote to that is lower your stress. Now let's look at this same continuum this time and I just call this testosterone sexy body sexy brain. How does it relate to sex? 

00:13:45
Sexy Body... Sexy Brain 

00:13:45
Autogenic Desire Psychogenic Desire 

00:13:45
PAT LOVE And a good analogy I think is thinking about the testosterone dominant person as a gas stove and the sexy brain person as, which is the estrogen dominant person, as the electric stove. You know, you turn on the gas stove, it is hot, it is ready, it goes full blast. Remember testosterone is that drive, that motivation, heightened response to anger and the action oriented hormone. Estrogen, on the other hand, is, it'll survey the situation, you know, take some time, it will warm up. It'll be a little more cautious. It'll maybe, you know be paying attention to, all the coils are getting hot at the same time. So, but here's the key. Once they get there, they're each hot. They're each hot. This is what you have to remember about when it comes to sexy body, sexy brain. You know, if you ask most people, they, we all wanna be sexual, we wanna be intimate in that way. Most people do. Not all. But, how we get there is what is the difference. In fact, let me give you an illustration. If you're the sexy body person, you know you can say this is autogenic and this is psychogenic. This is a person who walks around with a body sex ready. What I say about the sexy body person is a prerequisite for sex is this; is my heart beating? If my heart is beating, you can probably talk me into sex. Okay, so this is a person who sort of walks around and it doesn't take much stimulation to get to that heightened arousal. 

00:15:25
Autogenic Response Cycle 

00:15:25
PAT LOVE  And then that plateau, that area right before orgasm where your desire is so high and you're aroused and it's just this wonderful place and it's very predictable. It's very organized. And depending if you're male or female, once orgasm, yes there's a refractory period. But then you can start all over again. And please let me do that. Now for women there's not much of a refractory period. It's sort of an advantage that we females have. But here's the point. 

00:15:55
Psychogenic Sexual Response Cycle 

00:15:55
PAT LOVE If you look at the other side and you look at the sexy brain, the psychogenic sexual response cycle, what do you see? You see chaos. It's not as predictable because the sexy brain, desire, you might be aroused, but desire has a different prerequisite. Now people say, “Well in this new relationship with my new partner I feel...” throw out infatuation. Just take that out of the equation for right now. Because when we're infatuated, that three to six months, that altered state of romantic love, we all look like high testosterone. I'm talking about long term relationships. Being together over time. And this is where it's very very different for the sexy brain person. The sexy brain person in many ways has to make a cognitive decision. If I'm a sexy brain person I've gotta know what arouses me, what ignites my desire. But mainly, here's what I need to know, what lowers my stress level. If you wanna make love to a sexy brain person, lower his stress level. It's like, do the dishes, that's why housework is correlated with frequency of sex. Because the stress level. Because the amygdala literally won't let you feel that desire. You cannot feel desire when your brain is going crazy and wondering, “Oh did I get this done? Did I get this done? Are the kids here? Have I answered those emails? Look at the mess in this house,” and so forth. You've gotta lower your stress. You've gotta block off the time. You've got to make love happen. And this is why kindness, this is why connection, this is why helping, this is why talking, asking about your day, feeling close, this is why this is foreplay for the sexy brain person. You've gotta know what, and so you gotta know about your, are you high testosterone, high estrogen, are you got that sexy body, you got that sexy brain and you gotta know the difference not only about yourself, but about your partner. So let me give you some tips. 

00:18:35
Sexy Body/Sexy Brain 

00:18:35
It Helps to Know the Difference 

00:18:35
PAT LOVE  I actually, people always say, well, how do I really help if I've got this sexy body person? First of all, you've got to let your partner know if you're on this end, if you're the sexy brain, and you're at the sexy body person, first of all you've gotta let that person know what turns you on. If you're the sexy brain person you've gotta say, you'd be surprised that your kindness, when you picked me up at the airport and saved me all that time, that is really a turn on. You've gotta, first of all, let your partner know what activates your desire. But before you can even do that, you've gotta know what activates, you've gotta be responsible for your own desire. You have to be responsible for that, be able to communicate it to your partner. If you're the sexy body person, you gotta be reasonable about your expectations. You've gotta honor your partner's own form of foreplay. You might not need it. But if your partner needs it, your relationship needs it. So if you have this sexy body, with the sexy brain or two sexy bodies, two sexy brains. It's important to know the difference and knowing the difference will improve and create passion in a long term relationship and even a short term one.

Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:20:15
SHANNON DERMER Doctor Love. Thank you for that. I was actually very excited to hear this talk today, pun kind of intended. I think I'd like to amend your title ”Sexy Body Sexy Brains Sexy Host.” I was excited the entire time. 

00:20:35
PAT LOVE I like that. I like that. I like that I was part of that. 

00:20:35
SHANNON DERMER  You know what, obviously sex, desire, intimacy, passion is a topic that a lot of us are interested in but we're scared to ask about or talk about. 

00:20:50
PAT LOVE Yeah, yeah. 

00:20:50
SHANNON DERMER And this way I think it helps people understand each other and I'm gonna ask you about this but it's not meant as like an insult or anything like that. I'm gonna make the comparison just for a second to John Gray, “Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus.” 

00:21:05
PAT LOVE Yes. Yes. 

00:21:10
SHANNON DERMER Or whatever that, in that you're talking about gender differences. 

00:21:10
PAT LOVE Yes, yes. 

00:21:10
SHANNON DERMER But a lot of people didn't like his, a lot of people in the profession didn't like his talk about gender difference cause it seemed like what was just an excuse. How is yours different? 

00:21:20
Pat Love Ed.D. 

00:21:20
PAT LOVE  Yeah. I don't know that, I think the difference is, first of all we're all on the continuum. It's not just men are this way, women are this way. But the truth is nature actually selects for diversity. Difference makes us healthier. Difference creates, is behind passion. In fact if you're too much alike it can kill desire. If you have to be one person, if the two have to become one and I'm the one, if you have to be just like me, it can kill desire. And some people say that's fine. I'll take that close intimate relationship. In fact, in many ways, we've highly overrated intimacy as the key to all desire. Some of the desire is about mystery. And again, I think it's important to say it's not about capacity. I mean this really helped me because I'm obviously an estrogen dominant person. 

00:22:25
SHANNON DERMER Sexy brain. 

00:22:25
PAT LOVE The sexy brain person. And but in the beginning of a relationship, I felt like the sexy body person. And then it would go back to normal. And I would think where did my sex drive go? And I didn't realize that the pathway of arousal was very different for me. And I had to be, I had to know what that was. And my partner couldn't figure it out if I couldn't figure it out. So I don't think it's capacity here. I think it's important to say that it's motivation and impulse. And if I understand your impulse and think, cause I could take it personally that you're not talking. If you're high T and I'm not, and you don't come home and start talking to me, I could take that personally or I could say, “Oh wait a minute. Maybe I ought to, first of all give you some time and give you some space. But also maybe I should create a conversation that's more interesting to you and become better at engaging you.” Or, by the way, let me give you this cause this is such a good piece of information. My husband says to me, “Why do you tell me about something if I can't fix it?” Cause it doesn't have a purpose. 

00:23:45
SHANNON DERMER And that was that, you had the two different pathways, there was the mirror neurons and the... 

00:23:50
PAT LOVE And the TPJ. Temporal parietal junction. 

00:23:50
SHANNON DERMER The TPJ. 

00:23:55
PAT LOVE If he can't fix it, why even tell him about it? I have a perfect answer to this and I say, “You know why? Because when you listen, it means more than when anybody else listens.” 

00:24:05
SHANNON DERMER Ah. 

00:24:05
PAT LOVE Now once he understood this estrogen dominant person that listening is helping and listening also is foreplay and listening, I can't abuse that privilege and just go on and have a monologue. Cause I've done that. And he'll say, “Which part of that monologue do you want me to respond to?” So I have to be careful and not overload him. But on the other hand if I frame it in a way, so I don't think we should throw the baby out with the wash water when we're talking about difference. And by the way the more you repress it, the bigger and stronger it gets. 

00:24:50
SHANNON DERMER  Yeah, the more polarized. 

00:24:55
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:24:55
SHANNON DERMER But I know you have a book called ”Hot Monogamy.” But I think your next book should be “Listening is Foreplay.” 

00:25:00
PAT LOVE Oh. Good title. I like that title. 

00:25:05
SHANNON DERMER You said it. 

00:25:05
PAT LOVE You know what, that is. And it is for so many people. I had a woman I remember asking about foreplay, cause I do a lot of workshops on sex. And the first time I ever heard this she said, “Kindness is such a turn on.” And that was like wow. That was almost like a new idea, a new thought. And that, if you're the estrogen dominant person, yeah. But if the other one says, “Hey, you could be mad at me but let's have sex.” So I think honoring that difference keeps it more interesting and exciting. 

00:25:45
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:25:45
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. Well I think that's probably a really interesting conversation. I work with couples around sex and things like that and sometimes I'll have them define foreplay but usually I'm talking about something physical, cause that's a little bit different for every person. But it would be really interesting to do more what you're talking about which is some of it could be physical but some of it is emotional. How do you, what is foreplay to you? 

00:26:05
PAT LOVE Yes. 

00:26:05
SHANNON DERMER It doesn't have to be something physical. 

00:26:10
PAT LOVE Yes and I think you're making a very good point because especially the sexy brain person has to be proactive and have personal knowledge about okay what is the context in which I think about sex, I desire sex, more amenable and receptive to sex. I didn't talk about receptivity. But that's really really important. So what makes me, so I have to figure that out first and then become a grownup and responsible for creating that context. By the way let me just say this; this testosterone dominance, a big part of their challenge, they have to be proactive about the intimacy and talking and also gazing. You know gazing releases Oxytocin if your estrogen dominant. But gazing can be an act of defiance and challenge if you're testosterone dominant. And remember it's not just men, it's almost a third of women. And we're all in this continuum. So I think that it's, there's challenge on both ends but isn't that what life is about? Growing and developing and learning and also feeding what the relationship needs, which is also, it's not just you or me. It's what the relationship needs. 

00:27:35
SHANNON DERMER  We only have a little bit of time. But some of what you're talking about is why actually I find marriage and family therapy, couples therapy fascinating because the exact same behavior can have such different meaning and different effects to different people. So you're talking about eye gaze as intimacy for some and is aggressive for others. 

00:28:00
PAT LOVE Right, right. And that's why I like research and I know you do too. But that's really important, it's not one size fits all. That's why it's important to know when a couple comes in or when an individual comes in and you say, “How can I help?” I'm really listening to how can I help. I try to make it, when I ask a couple that, I think of PMS. Positive, measurable, specific. 

00:28:25
SHANNON DERMER Oh that's much nicer. 

00:28:25
PAT LOVE If you left here and you said, “Wow. That counseling, that therapy was really worth the time, money and effort.” What would be different? So I try to move them toward that and get their values in it. 

00:28:40
SHANNON DERMER Well thank you. That's a great note to end on. A great piece of advice. I wanna thank all of you for joining us today, for Doctor Love's talk.
