00:01:40
NARRATOR In the field of psychology and education, scholars like BF Skinner and Jean Piaget mentored other imminent individuals like Robert Epstein and Lev Vygotsky. What can we learn from this? Quite simply, most people who have achieved success have done so with the help of good mentors. Few have reached the top of their field without a lot of guidance and support along the way. Mentoring may not be an official program or job requirement, but it can be critical to success. Yet people often do not know how to mentor. This video will teach you how to be a good mentor using research done at Stanford University by Dr. Anne Chan. 

00:02:25
DR. ANNE CHAN Hello, I'm Dr. Anne Chan, author of Inspire, Connect, Empower, a practical guide to how to be an outstanding mentor. I have been both a mentor as well as a mentee and I research, write and consult about mentoring and diversity. My mentor, Dr. Joseph White, has made a world of difference in my professional life. He has been such an inspiration to me that I have dedicated my professional life to teaching and educating people about mentoring. Even though we are worlds apart in terms of our race and culture, we still have a solid mentoring relationship that started over a decade ago. In this video, you will learn what mentoring is and what mentoring looks like. You will learn how mentoring benefits not only the mentees, but also the mentors. I will give you research based, but also very practical, tips on how to be an excellent mentor. I will be showcasing examples from higher education, but these tips are relevant, regardless of the setting you are in, whether it is education, business, non-profit, community, counseling or psychology. And you can use these tips whether you are working with a young child, an adolescent or an adult. The people you will meet and learn from in this video are actual mentors and mentees with a combined 120 years of mentoring experience. Let me introduce you to them.

DR. ANNE CHAN And Cynthia Medina, currently a doctoral student in counseling psychology at the University of Oregon. Together with myself, the six of us represent a four generation mentoring tree which grew when Dr. White mentored Dr. Parham who then went on to mentor Dr. Tewari, who is now mentoring Cynthia Medina. Another strong branch of this tree grew when Dr. White took me on as a mentee. Dr. White, Dr. Parham and I are now mentoring Ramar Henderson. It would take too long to show you all the many members of this extensive mentoring family and network, but the six people you will hear from have all been deeply involved and inspired by the power of mentoring. They will share their real life experiences and thoughts about mentoring with you. 

00:05:15
WHY MENTOR? 

00:05:15
NARRATOR Let's start with a question, why mentor? Researchers have shown many benefits associated with mentoring. Here are some of the benefits enjoyed by the mentees in our mentoring family. 

00:05:25
DR. NITA TEWARI I received wonderful coaching, I get inside information, I have had professional opportunities created for me and I received, um, emotional support and I've gotten great feedback. 

00:05:40
WHY MENTOR? 

00:05:40
CYNTHIA MEDINA The benefits that I get from being mentored that I would have otherwise not gotten are greater awareness of the counseling psychology field. I have also gained, uh, a role model. I have gotten the opportunity to meet other psychologists in the field and to broaden my network. I have also had the opportunity to go to conferences, develop my professional skills, my social skills and so he has definitely given me a lot of opportunities that otherwise, I had - I would not have gotten. 

00:06:10
WHY MENTOR? 

00:06:10
RAMAR HENDERSON One benefit actually is being introduced into the profession. You know, I remember before, you know, I ran into a few of my mentors, I wasn't really involved in the profession like I am now, so being able to go to conferences, being able to see people who look like me, doing things that I will be doing you know, in five or six years, so that's been a very big thing. 

00:06:30
NARRATOR As you can see, mentees enjoy many different benefits, but potential mentors are often unsure about how to mentor. So let's take a look at the big picture. What is mentoring? The word mentor dates all the way back to the ancient Greek classic The Odyssey, in which King Odysseus appointed a tutor, mentor to watch over his son while Odysseus goes off to battle. The word mentor is now used to designate a person who guides and supports the growth and development of another. Those who are mentored are either called protegees or mentees. Mentees can be of any age, and be at any developmental or professional stage. A mentee could be an elementary school student, a newcomer to a job or college or even someone in senior management. Any person entering a new environment or wishing to acquire a new skill can benefit from being a mentee. There is no universal definition of mentoring, but most definitions describe mentoring as guiding, coaching, role modeling and supporting the growth of another. Let's hear from real life mentors and mentees about their personal definitions of a mentor. 

00:07:45
DEFINITIONS OF MENTORING 

00:07:45
A Mentor is: A senior individual A trusted advisor A facilitator 

00:07:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM You know, as I think about a mentor, um, for me, a mentor is a senior, more experienced, uh, individual, uh, a trusted advisor if you will, who is invested in and committed to facilitating the personal and intellectual growth of another individual. 

00:08:10
A Mentor is: A Coach 

00:08:10
RAMAR HENDERSON My definition of a mentor is someone who is a coach or a friend to me. And what I mean by that is, just like a coach would kind of direct a, you know, a player, a basketball player in how to, you know, dribble or how to shoot a basket, same thing for a mentor - someone who can coach me both personally and professionally, that can help me continue to grow, you know, and continue to grow into a bigger and better person, I suppose. 

00:08:35
A Mentor is: A source of support 

00:08:35
CYNTHIA MEDINA My definition of a mentor is someone who takes you under their wing, providing unconditional love, support, guidance. A mentor is someone who genuinely cares about you and is interested in developing an authentic personal relationship, uh, and an emotional bond. 

00:08:50
Is a mentor like a psychologist? 

00:08:55
NARRATOR Some might think that a mentor is like a counselor or a psychologist. Although a mentor provides emotional support, he or she is not a counselor or a therapist. According to Dr. Parham, there are key differences between mentoring and counseling. 

00:09:05
Differences between mentoring and counseling 

00:09:10
DR. THOMAS PARHAM What a psychologist and a therapist does is try to establish a relationship with a patient where you are trying to help them, um, confront, manage, some kind of mild, moderate or severe debilitation in their life and so the role of a mentor is very, very different, I think, than, um, you know being a psychologist or a therapist in someone's life. Um, in that case, I think the boundaries of being a therapist, in fact, are, uh, um, much more established in the sense that you don't have often times personal relationships with your clients and patients in the same way that a mentor would with their mentees. You know, they have to be relatively different. The other piece is that while mentors are engaged in helping explore the dream, helping crystallize identity, um, helping to understand a persons talent and skill, helping them to believe in themselves in ways they might have not have believed before, all of those, I think, have, uh, dimensions of a kind of psychological aspect to them, but what you're providing for the person at that point is advice, guidance, support, vision, not psychologizing them in a way that really tries to work on their mental therapeutic to try to achieve some kind of therapeutic outcome. So those to me, I think, become the fundamental differences between the two roles. 

00:10:50
NARRATOR Mentors do provide emotional support, but it is appropriate for a mentor to refer a mentee to a professional counselor when the mentee's issues go beyond a mentor's capacity. 

00:11:00
Mentoring vs. Counseling 

00:11:05
DR. JOSEPH WHITE The mentor has to be sensitive as to where the overload is occurring and how its affecting the mentoring relationship. So let me give you an example. I had a student one time who had some unresolved abuse issues from childhood. And these abuse issues were destroying his marriage and destroying other relationships because he was always hostile and confused, so it seemed to me that the abuse was beginning, beginning to become into the center of our relationship, so we weren't getting much done toward moving toward goals because we were spending all our time on the abuse. So then we talked about that and he agreed that we were spending our time on that and I felt that a professional therapist, a counselor, could work with that more effectively than I could and then that would free our relationship to go back to work on the goals of becoming a counseling psychologist and a teacher. So I was able to - we were able to separate the two out. 

00:12:10
NARRATOR Other people have concerns about boundary violations if they are supervising as well as mentoring an individual. Dr. White, a mentor with decades of mentoring experience, has this to say. 

00:12:20
Boundaries in Mentoring 

00:12:20
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Now at some point, the relationship can get overloaded and the boundaries can start stretching when the mentee and the mentor become friends. And that's very important in the ethnic community because, for example, in the Hispanic community, we believe in personalismo, that every relationship has a personal dimension and that's the core of the relationship, but now, once you start being into this personalismo and a kind of a friendship familial thing, then that boundary can begin to stretch, so you have to be concerned about the boundary violations. At the same time, you can't be so contained that your relationship with a person becomes too highly structured and too rigid. 

00:13:10
Boundaries in Mentoring 

00:13:10
NARRATOR Note that both Dr. White in the previous clip and Dr. Parham caution against maintaining too rigid of a boundary at the expense of connectedness. 

00:13:20
Boundaries vs. Emotional Closeness in Mentoring 

00:13:20
DR. THOMAS PARHAM At some point I think it's important to be able to attend to what I think are appropriate boundaries, but I get concerned, I think, when people talk bout rigid adherence to, to boundaries and roles, as if somehow there were this, um, you know, kind of space that you somehow shouldn't cross. Now, there's an extreme of that, for example, you should never, as a mentor, you should never be in a space where you are able to exploit your student, so being able to move in those kind of spaces, I think, becomes really inappropriate, but I think when the bonds become, or the boundaries, I should say, become so rigid that it prevents you from being able to connect with people in more authentic ways. It prevents you from being able to have that human touch and that human connection to other folk. Then I think that boundary and that rigid adherence to such, uh, inhibits your ability to develop relationships number one, and inhibits your ability to develop that level of authenticity, I think, in relationships. So, you as a mentor have to trust that the emotional closeness and the boundaries that you create, uh, can be respected within certain confines, but that you can't be so objective in your analysis of your relationships with the people that you trying to impact that you somehow don't develop the emotional bonds that allow you to do all those other kinds of things that we talked about earlier. 

00:14:45
Mentoring Across Cultures 

00:14:50
NARRATOR We've learned about the roles of the mentor and the importance of connectedness in a mentoring relationship. An important concern for potential mentors is how to mentor someone from a different race or culture. Is it possible to have a good mentoring connection with somebody from a different background? 

00:15:05
Mentoring Someone From a Different Race 

00:15:05
NARRATOR Let's hear from Dr. Tewari who is been both a mentor and a mentee with people from different cultures. 

00:15:10
Mentoring Someone From a Different Race or Culture 

00:15:10
DR. NITA TEWARI A lot of times people think that, um, a mentor should only mentor someone of the same race, the same ethnicity, the same religion, same gender, and that's not the case. I believe that a good mentor can mentor a student across race, ethnicity, genders, religions. So that's, I think, something important to know because a lot of times people don't want to mentor because of that fear. 

00:15:40
[music] 

00:15:40
NARRATOR But what does mentoring look like in practice? What does a mentor actually do with a mentee? Dr. Chan's research provides us with a practical model for mentoring across cultures. 

00:15:50
MENTEE MENTOR RELATIONSHIP 

00:15:50
DR. ANNE CHAN People often think of mentoring as a private exchange between mentor and mentee, where the mentor's main task is to give information and advice to the mentee. Now certainly this is a core piece of mentoring, however, in my research, I found that outstanding mentors who work successfully with ethnic minority mentees did not confine themselves to just giving information and advice. Instead, they made the time and effort o build strong relationships with their mentees. The word relationship is one of the key pieces to the success of the mentoring. These mentors establish strong relationships with their mentees in the following key ways. 

00:16:35
MENTEE MENTOR Dimensions of Mentor Practices Relationship Building & Maintaining Trust 

00:16:35
DR. ANNE CHAN First and very importantly, they establish trust by showing interest in all dimensions of their mentees' lives. By being willing to talk about their mentees' multiple identities, by being responsive in their communication, by taking responsibility when they make mistakes and by being true to their word. 

00:16:55
BUILDING TRUST 

00:16:55
RAMAR HENDERSON Trust was not built up from the beginning. Um, my mentors earn my trust, one by being transparent, you know. When you see someone who has made it and who is, who is an esteemed professional, to hear that, you know what, they didn't make it on their first try or they're human, you know, they had these - kind of hiccups in their career and to say okay and to kind of, you know, attach that to who I am at - who I am and where I'm at in my journey, I think that's very big. So being able to kind of align and to share, to share, to share those hiccups in a way that doesn't make it about them, you know, wen that sharing is really still about me and saying okay, this is an example and this how this example relates to your journey and where you are right now. My mentor was actually willing to meet me in places I was familiar with, so example, like going into a restaurant, you know, eating over some food, you know, just having those type of interactions, I mean it wasn't the conversation wasn't on some really high intellectual level, it was really just, you know, it was real. So I was able to kind of have a human contact and really accept me for who I was, you know, all my mentors don't necessarily look like me or the same age as me or come from, you know, the same areas I've come from, so being able to just have those interactions and really say, you know, I'm really going to take the time to get to know who Ramar is and everything that - he - that compromises his identity. 

00:18:15
BUILDING TRUST 

00:18:20
CYNTHIA MEDINA It's been very important that my mentor has been very responsive and communicative. He has frequent contact with me and whenever I'm feeling stressed, homesick, uh, or lonely, since I live away from home, I sometimes reach out to him and seek hIm out for emotional support since he really understands what it's like to be in graduate school and that fact that he is responsive and is there for me when I need him the most has meant a lot and has helped me really believe that he cares about me and my well-being. In the past seven years that I have known him, he, uh, is constantly, uh, interested in how graduate school is going for me, uh, in what I'm doing and he also shares his own life experiences, his own career experiences, and, um, my mentor has also, uh, taken the time, uh, to know my family, to embrace my family, uh, and to know my culture. He has taken us out, um, to brunch for my graduation, and, um, has really, genuinely been interested in getting to know me as a person. 

00:19:25
MENTEE MENTOR Dimensions of Mentor Practices Relationship Building & Maintaining Trust Individual Developing Skills Providing Support 

00:19:25
DR. ANNE CHAN Second, outstanding mentors developed their mentee's skills and potential by discussing their dreams and goals, providing quality feedback, coaching them, giving them opportunities to enhance their skills, providing practical support and building their confidence. 

00:19:40
DEVELOPING SKILLS 

00:19:45
DR. NITA TEWARI Specifically, he has introduced me to people who have then gone on to help me create jobs with them. He has specifically given me feedback on, this is the way, you know, you should do things or you shouldn't do things when I 'm a little bit curious about how I should go about doing something. He's been an advisor, he has coached me, he has shown interest in my life, he has helped me create my goals and helped me create new dreams that I never envisioned for myself. And overall, he's really expressed a belief in me. 

00:20:20
DEVELOPING SKILLS 

00:20:20
DR. JOSEPH WHITE What we would provide for them are two layers of experiences. First of all, as they try to become and reach out to grow and become teachers, we would provide them with becoming a teaching assistant or discussion leader for an undergraduate in a class to get the feel of the classroom and then gradually we would move them up until, toward the end of their training, they would be teaching their own class under supervision. So we would take them through sequential development from being a discussion leader, a teaching assistant, and then to having their own class. 

00:20:55
DEVELOPING SKILLS 

00:20:55
CYNTHIA MEDINA He has also, um, sent me books. He mails me books, he mails me brochures, uh, he sends me emails, uh, showing me what he's doing, which gives me an idea of what my future might look like and what are the different opportunities I may have in the future. 

00:21:15
DEVELOPING SKILLS 

00:21:15
RAMAR HENDERSON I have one mentor, every conference that I go to, I essentially never have to worry about eating, because he always makes sure that, okay, if you're hungry, let's go to a restaurant. Not only am I eating well, but I'm able to have good conversation, you know, about life, you know, about graduate school, about different things and also, you know, practical is just making sure that I'm able to get to the conference. Because as we all know, graduate students don't make, you know, large amounts of money, so just being able to travel to, like, a APA or to the National Association of Black Psychologists, you know, if there is additional funds that I may need, you know, the mentor definitely kind of covers the gap, whatever is not covered by school. 

00:21:55

00:21:55
Dimensions of Mentor Practices PROFESSION JOB SCHOOL MENTEE MENTOR Institutional Teaching "rules" Role Modeling Providing Opportunities Building Networks Relationship Building & Maintaining Trust Individual Developing Skills Providing Support 

00:21:55
DR. ANNE CHAN Third, outstanding mentors socialize their mentees into the culture of the school, job, organization or group by teaching them the unwritten rules and by introducing them to key people and helping them build a professional network. 

00:22:10
FACILITATING SOCIALIZATION 

00:22:10
DR. NITA TEWARI The professors, the psychologists, the faculty members, they have the inside information and there's no way that students will possess that inside information, so I think it's up to us, as faculty members and mentors to be able to share the, uh, inside workings and the ongoings, the behind the scenes of what happens at research institutions, at psychology clinics, at conferences, to educate the students. Otherwise, they're just not going to know. 

00:22:40
FACILITATING SOCIALIZATION 

00:22:40
DR. JOSEPH WHITE We're trying to de-mystify how the profession works. What do psychologists actually do all day long and who are they? So we try to take them to conventions and meetings where they can meet other psychologists in the field that they've read about, talk to them, and learn what I call the inside game that's not written down in a book. For example, how to get tenure is not written in a book, some words are written in a book - the faculty manual - but some people read the words and get tenure and some don't and what is the difference between those two sets of people? And then finally, as we move through these experiences, you learn to do by watching people do things, so they're shadowing us, moving around with us, seeing how we teach, how we do clinical services, how we meet people at meetings, and through that shadowing modeling is another layer of their learning. 

00:23:35
FACILITATING SOCIALIZATION 

00:23:40
CYNTHIA MEDINA He has introduced Latina role models for me at conferences, um, at every conference that I go to with him, he, um, takes me to the different social hours and introduces me to people, encourages me to network. I've definitely seen him and he's been a great role model and, uh, that's made me feel more comfortable and more natural doing it when I go to conferences and he's not there with me. Um, he's encouraged me to go to the National Latina and Latino Psychological Association where I have also had the opportunity to meet other Latina and Latino psychologists who share similar values and similar background as I do. 

00:24:15
Dimensions of Mentor Practices SOCIO-CULTURAL PROFESSION JOB SCHOOL MENTEE MENTOR Socio-Cultural Providing Emotional Support Providing Guidance Providing ProtectionInstitutional Teaching "rules" Role Modeling Providing Opportunities Building Networks Relationship Building & Maintaining Trust Individual Developing Skills Providing Support 

00:24:15
DR. ANNE CHAN Fourth, but not least, outstanding mentors help their mentees navigate outside forces that might derail their mentees' progress. They gave advice and support and provided protection when necessary. Examples of outside forces that might impact an individual include discrimination or life events such as a marriage or birth and family obligations. 

00:24:40
NAVIGATING OUTSIDE FORCES 

00:24:40
DR. NITA TEWARI Yes, I, uh, really struggled with being a female in the, uh, field of psychology as I was about to get married and needed to balance my personal life and my professional life and, um, my mentor was very honest with me and said, you know what, I'm a male, um, I don't understand completely the female experience, so it might be important for you to consult and talk with other mentors because one mentor is not the only person that you should completely rely upon. So, I felt - I felt really, really supported. I felt really heard and I felt like my mentor wasn't pushing his way or the right way of how I need to, um, proceed with my career journey. 

00:25:25
NAVIGATING OUTSIDE FORCES 

00:25:30
RAMAR HENDERSON My mentor has dealt with specific things as far as, you know, being a graduate student, you know, kind of just educating me on how to navigate my way through. For example, different, uh, different social and political climates that you typically happens in graduate school and how to navigate and navigate it successfully. They understand, you know, my plight as being an African American male in undergraduate school. Um, that in itself can be a very, very hard, um, a very hard journey and so part of having mentors who understand my journey, it makes it - it makes them much better and it increases the understanding and as far as provides protection, you know, in case I ever, ever run into a situation that I felt, okay, I need someone, you know, that can - that knows me and can intercede for me and be able to say, okay, I know this is not in Ramar's character, you know, mentors also do that for me as well. 

00:26:15
NAVIGATING OUTSIDE FORCES 

00:26:20
DR. NITA TEWARI I think it's really important for, uh, a mentor to protect their students because they are exactly the kind of people that can protect students because they are in the position of power and sometimes professors don't think that they should or could do that, but they're exactly the people who can because students just don't possess the same amount of power, knowledge, and resources and networks, so what a faculty member can do, a student can't do. So, I think it's always, um, important for faculty members to go ahead and protect students and not to feel shy about that. 

00:26:50
Ecological, Relational, Cross-Cultural Model of Mentoring SOCIO-CULTURAL PROFESSION JOB SCHOOL MENTEE MENTOR Dimensions of Mentor Practices Socio-Cultural Providing Emotional Support Providing Guidance Providing Protection Institutional Teaching "rules" Role Modeling Providing Opportunities Building Networks Relationship Building & Maintaining Trust Individual Developing Skills Providing Support 

00:26:50
DR. ANNE CHAN In sum, the outstanding mentors I interviewed in my research did not see their mentees solely in terms of their career concerns. Rather, they were willing to have a holistic and ecological view of their mentees, meaning that they were interested in their mentees' personal lives, families, significant others, cultural and racial obligations and the community obligations - and their professional dreams and aspirations. 

00:27:20
IMPORTANCE OF BEING HOLISTIC IN MENTORING 

00:27:20
DR. ANNE CHAN They socialize their mentees by teaching them the norms of their schools and fields. While, at the same time, helping them negotiate outside forces like racism and life events. 

00:27:35
CYNTHIA MEDINA The holistic mentoring that he has offered and provided has, um, definitely demonstrated the he not only cares about my academics, but how my well-being is, how my family's doing, uh, how my personal life is going and so he's definitely interested in me as a person and, um, not only myself but my family and he knows that family is big for me and he's taken the time to meet my mom, to meet my grandma, to meet my sisters and, uh, and has shown that he genuinely cares about me. And over time, that love, support, encouragement, inspiration - that's, that's been, uh, that's meant a lot to me and has shown me that he really believes in me and cares about me and my potential, my development and so that over time, has helped me trust him and trust that he does truly believe in me. 

00:28:25
DR. ANNE CHAN They were also willing to be proactive in helping out their mentees and showing them the ropes. The mentees did not have to beg or ask for favors. Instead, the mentors thought about what the mentees needed and provided opportunities freely and willingly. 

00:28:40
IMPORTANCE OF BEING PROACTIVE 

00:28:40
DR. NITA TEWARI My, uh, mentors over the years have been extremely proactive. I felt like I've had to ask a little, but I've received a lot and what I mean by that is, uh, professors telling me about opportunities with internships, jobs, volunteering, conferences, being able to contribute to books, to write a chapter, to collaborate with other colleagues on publishing papers. So, I felt like, um, my mentors have been quite proactive in presenting opportunities to me. 

00:29:15
DR. ANNE CHAN Above and beyond, they were wiling to work to establish genuine, trusting and caring relationships with their mentees. 

00:29:25
IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING GENUINE RELATIONSHIPS 

00:29:25
DR. JOSEPH WHITE Well I think the importance of mentoring as a real relationship is that the younger person bonds to the mentor in a way that establishes trust and confidence so within the authenticity of the relationship, the younger person feels safe and a sense of trust and they can open up to the next layer of growth. 

00:29:45
IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING GENUINE RELATIONSHIPS 

00:29:50
DR. NITA TEWARI Also, when I think about mentoring, I feel like, you know, mentoring is a human relationship and like any human relationship, there's chemistry, there's vibe, there's energy between the mentor and the mentee and, um, sometimes it's deeper and sometimes it's not so deep, but I feel like that's really important too in thinking about as being a mentor how you want to approach mentoring, so pay attention to that when you choose to go down that road. 

00:30:15
WHAT MENTORING LOOKS LIKE 

00:30:20
NARRATOR In the next half of the video, you will get to see mentoring in action through two role plays. 

00:30:25
Bad Mentoring 

00:30:25
NARRATOR The first demonstrates how not to mentor. 

00:30:25
Good Mentoring 

00:30:30
NARRATOR The second shows you how one mentor works effectively with her ethnic minority mentee. 

00:30:30
Bad Mentor Role Play 

00:30:35
NARRATOR Let's begin with our first role play which demonstrates specific things that mentors should not do. Note that the mentor is not doing anything immoral or unethical, but her indifference is none the less damaging. Note, too that the mentor in the role play may seem extreme, but her actions are based on things that real life advisors have done. As you watch this role play, think about what the mentor does or does not do and how you might act differently with your mentee.

00:31:05
RAMAR HENDERSON Tried five times to get an appointment and am successful on the sixth. I'm excited about my meeting with Dr. Malus today. I'm looking forward to getting some new tips on how to improve my paper and how to become a better writer. 

00:31:25
[sil.] 

00:31:30
RAMAR HENDERSON Um, we made our appointment for one. It's one, so let's give her a couple of seconds. All right, let's go ahead and see here. 

00:31:45
[sil.] 

00:31:45
DR. MALUS Yeah? 

00:31:45
RAMAR HENDERSON Hey. How are you doing? Uh. Man. 

00:31:55
[sil.] 

00:32:00
RAMAR HENDERSON All right. I think I'll try again. 

00:32:05
DR. MALUS Uh-huh. Yeah. 

00:32:10
RAMAR HENDERSON Hey. Dr. Malus. Hey, how are you doing? Uh. 

00:32:10
DR. MALUS Um. Yes. Uh-huh. Right. Right. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Well you know, we're going to be doing qualitative and quantitative research. 

00:32:30
RAMAR HENDERSON Oh man, that's my favorite. 

00:32:30
DR. MALUS Mixed methods. Right. They're going to be really impressed. Yep. And we've been tracking these athletes for 10 years now, so you can imagine the kind of data we have. 

00:32:40
RAMAR HENDERSON I'm an ex-student athlete. I want to research athletes. 

00:32:45
DR. MALUS Oh, you know what? Uh, I have a class to teach in five minutes. Oh I'd love to, gosh I would love to talk to you. 

00:32:55
RAMAR HENDERSON I thought were were scheduled for 30. 

00:32:55
DR. MALUS Yeah, but you know what? Uh, these students take up so much of my time. But, I - I'll talk to you real soon. All right. Bye. Take care. 

00:33:05
RAMAR HENDERSON Uh, Dr. Malus, how are you doing? 

00:33:05
DR. MALUS Yeah?Yes, Ramon, what do you need? 

00:33:10
RAMAR HENDERSON Um, this is actually Ramar, but Dr. Malus I was hoping to get some feedback about my paper. 

00:33:15
DR. MALUS Just a second. Uh-huh? Yeah. Oh. The provost didn't get my email? Oh, I'll be sure to send him right away. Yeah. Yeah. I've got some really important things that I'm sure he's going to like. Okay. Okay. Gotcha. I'll send it to him right away. 

00:33:30
RAMAR HENDERSON Uh. 

00:33:30
DR. MALUS Just a second. Important email. 

00:33:40
[sil.] 

00:33:40
DR. MALUS Yes Raoul? 

00:33:40
RAMAR HENDERSON Um, it's actually Ramar, but I'm going to let that one pass. Uh, Dr. Malus, we - we made a 30 minute appointment today. 

00:33:50
DR. MALUS You should have reminded me. 

00:33:50
RAMAR HENDERSON Um. Okay. Uh, well actually, you know, I was coming in to, you know, get some feedback on my paper. You know, just some potential strategies to help me become a better writer and write, you know, better papers. 

00:34:05
DR. MALUS Well, you know, um, they have a really good writing center on campus, somewhere over there. Why don't you just go and, uh, they have excellent tutors who can really help you, okay? So, um, students like you could really use some - get some great help from the writing center. Mm-hmm. 

00:34:20
RAMAR HENDERSON Um. You know what? I really appreciate that tip Dr. Malus. 

00:34:25
DR. MALUS Yeah. 

00:34:25
RAMAR HENDERSON Some other things that are affecting me as far as my assignments, there was really, um, there's really been some really harsh things happening towards the black student population on campus and it's really been really bothering me and kind of affecting me being able to, uh, focus. 

00:34:40
DR. MALUS Yeah. That's - yeah, that's too bad. Um. Yeah. Hey, would you mind picking up that pink sheet over there? The one that says APA on it? 

00:34:55
[sil.] 

00:34:55
DR. MALUS Great. Thank you. You're a doll. Thank you. 

00:34:55
RAMAR HENDERSON Uh. 

00:35:00
DR. MALUS I'm so excited about APA. 

00:35:00
RAMAR HENDERSON You know what Dr. Malus? I actually overheard you talking to one of your colleagues about, you know, potentially presenting on some mixed method research on, uh, sports psychology and I was actually looking forward to, you know, anything I can do to potentially present with you. 

00:35:10
DR. MALUS You know Rodriguez, um, you're not at that level yet. APA is very high level, so here's what I suggest. You know, work hard, um, wait five, six years maybe and then you'll be at that level. I'd like to be encouraging, so, you know, given seven, eight years, maybe you could present at APA, all right? 

00:35:30
RAMAR HENDERSON Um, about that recommendation for, for the scholarship? 

00:35:35
DR. MALUS Oh. Yeah? Uh, recommendation. Oh, I must have forgotten. Uh, you know I've been busy, so busy with these conferences and everything, so why don't you just send me an email or a couple of emails and I'll be sure to get back to you in a couple of months, okay? All right. You've been great. Take care. 

00:36:00
[sil.] 

00:36:00
RAMAR HENDERSON She's about as likely to write the recommendation as she is to remember my name. 

00:36:10
[music] 

00:36:10
Bad Mentoring 

00:36:10
NARRATOR Let's ask Ramar how a bad mentor like Dr. Malus might affect him. 

00:36:15
Ramar Henderson Student Elizabeth Robey Interviewer 

00:36:15
ELIZABETH ROBEY Can you tell me a little bit about how such an advisor would impact the success in your program? 

00:36:25
RAMAR HENDERSON I mean, quite simply, she makes me want to be unsuccessful, you know? 

00:36:25
ELIZABETH ROBEY (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

00:36:25
RAMAR HENDERSON I'm already in a vulnerable position, coming to ask for help and me trying to improve myself, which I take - which I think takes courage and she really put me even lower than, you know, where I was previously and so, you know, people like that can make me want to be unsuccessful. 

00:36:40
ELIZABETH ROBEY (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

00:36:40
How often does bad mentoring occur? 

00:36:45
NARRATOR Ramar has just talked about the negative impact of bad mentoring. Unfortunately, bad or indifferent mentoring does happen more often than good mentoring. 

00:36:50
ELIZABETH ROBEY In your journey through college and graduate school, how typical was this for you? 

00:36:55
RAMAR HENDERSON Um, not to this extreme. 

00:37:00
ELIZABETH ROBEY (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

00:37:00
RAMAR HENDERSON You know I do find it very common that, you know, as, you know, not being embraced and, you know, go to the writing center or here's an assignment, do it on your own. So, you, you find this to be more common place where this was a more extreme example. 

00:37:15
ELIZABETH ROBEY (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

00:37:15
RAMAR HENDERSON It, it definitely happens more often than not. 

00:37:15
Good Mentor Role Play 

00:37:20
NARRATOR Let's now move from bad mentoring to a demonstration of good mentoring. In the next role play, pay attention to how the mentor addresses cultural issues. Observe the different things that the mentor initiates and offers to do without her mentee having to ask for these things. 

00:37:35
CYNTHIA MEDINA I'm so relieved I can count on Dr. Tewari with this one. This has been stressing me out. 

00:37:45
[sil.] 

00:37:45
CYNTHIA MEDINA Hi. 

00:37:55
DR. NITA TEWARI Okay, so, you know, my student's here now, so how about we follow up on this, um, a little bit later? Okay? All right. Great. Thanks. All right. Bye. 

00:38:00
Mentor Practice Listening 

00:38:05
DR. NITA TEWARI So let me turn off the ringer, so I can give you all my attention. 

00:38:05
Mentor Practice Acknowledging mistakes 

00:38:05
Mentor Practices Self-disclosure Using humor 

00:38:05
DR. NITA TEWARI Sorry Cynthia. I got this new, this new phone and I thought it was going to keep me organized, but in fact, it's actually made me busier than I ever thought I'd be. 

00:38:15
CYNTHIA MEDINA (crosstalk)Oh. 

00:38:15
DR. NITA TEWARI So, I'm sorry about that. 

00:38:15
CYNTHIA MEDINA That's okay. 

00:38:15
DR. NITA TEWARI So how are you doing today? 

00:38:15
Mentor Practice Listening 

00:38:20
CYNTHIA MEDINA Well not so good actually. I've been feeling really stressed about the incident when Dr. Malus made the comment about ethnic minorities the other day. Uh, it seemed like she was mad at me when I shared my experience about the Latina experience and, uh, I'm afraid that, uh, she's upset at me and it's going to affect my grade. 

00:38:40
Mentor Practice Providing emotional support 

00:38:40
DR. NITA TEWARI Okay. Yeah. I heard about that incident that happened in class and I'm sorry that that happened. 

00:38:45
Mentor Practice Acknowledging discrimination 

00:38:45
DR. NITA TEWARI You would think that in a psychology class and that being even a multi-cultural psychology class that that wouldn't have happened but unfortunately, these things do happen. 

00:38:50
Mentor Practice Validating 

00:38:55
DR. NITA TEWARI But, I thought it was very brave of you to stand up, speak your mind, tell what was on your - in your heart and on your mind. 

00:39:00
Mentor Practice Acknowledging discrimination 

00:39:00
Mentor Practice Providing emotional support 

00:39:00
DR. NITA TEWARI So, um, but it was unfair that you had to go through that. So, kind of thinking about the incident, um, you know, how are you feeling about it? 

00:39:10
Mentor Practice Listening 

00:39:15
CYNTHIA MEDINA Um, well, I've been feeling really stressed about it. Other students related to the experienced and they were glad I spoke up, so I'm glad I did speak up and at the same time, I'm afraid that I'm going to be the target now. 

00:39:20
Mentor Practices Providing emotional support Validating 

00:39:25
DR. NITA TEWARI (crosstalk)Hmm. Yeah. I can understand why you'd feel targeted. It was just, uh, a really tough situation to deal with. 

00:39:30
Mentor Practice Providing emotional support 

00:39:30
DR. NITA TEWARI And, you know, whatever you choose to do about that whole thing with Dr. Malus, what - I'll support you. 

00:39:35
Mentor Practices Protecting Being proactive 

00:39:35
DR. NITA TEWARI I'm just kind of thinking, how about for starters, like how would you feel if I went and talked to Dr. Malus about that incident? 

00:39:40
CYNTHIA MEDINA That would be great. 

00:39:45
DR. NITA TEWARI Okay. I'll take care of that for you. I'll go talk to her. 

00:39:45
CYNTHIA MEDINA Okay. Thank you. Actually, Dr. Tewari, I came to talk about my paper, uh, I was looking through your feedback and, um, I was hoping for a better grade and I'm not sure where I went wrong. 

00:39:55
Mentor Practice Building confidence 

00:40:00
DR. NITA TEWARI Okay. Yeah, let's take a look at your paper. Okay, yes. So I remember reviewing this. So you started off really strong. You have a wonderful opening thesis statement here. 

00:40:05
CYNTHIA MEDINA (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:40:05
Mentor Practice Providing quality, detailed feedback 

00:40:10
DR. NITA TEWARI Loved your references. Loved your supporting arguments and everything, but then as you continue to write, I started to kind of lose you because you introduced a whole another thesis statement. So what; good is you have enough content here for this paper for two different papers and two different research projects. However, for this particular paper, um, I think it would be best if you just stuck with the first thesis. So my recommendation to you is, you know, go back and, um, rewrite it with the first thesis statement and I'll be happy to go back and re-review it and take a look at it and then, um, keep the second one for the future, for a future paper, so - 

00:40:50
CYNTHIA MEDINA (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:40:50
DR. NITA TEWARI When you're done, give it back to me. 

00:40:50
CYNTHIA MEDINA Okay. I get it. So then I should have just stuck with the first thesis and written my whole paper on it. 

00:40:55
DR. NITA TEWARI Yes. 

00:40:55
CYNTHIA MEDINA (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:40:55
Mentor Practice Building confidence 

00:40:55
Mentor Practices Discussing dreams and goals Validating 

00:40:55
CYNTHIA MEDINA You did a really great job. You definitely have a future as a faculty researcher, because the way that you were thinking and writing, you show great potential. 

00:41:05
Mentor Practice Discussing dreams and goals 

00:41:05
CYNTHIA MEDINA Wow. Really? Thank you so much. It's funny you say that because I've been thinking more and more about the fact that I do want to become a faculty at a research type of institution and, um, the only thing is, that I don't really know how to get to that point. 

00:41:15
Mentor Practices Building confidence Validating Providing detailed, quality feedback 

00:41:15
DR. NITA TEWARI Okay. Well I'd be happy to talk to you about that. You really do possess a lot of the qualities that a good researcher needs. You're really organized, you're very thorough, you have wonderful ideas and you're very expansive when you write, so, it's - you write very clearly. 

00:41:30
CYNTHIA MEDINA Thank you. It really means a lot to me. It just makes me a little bit nervous. 

00:41:35
Mentor Practice Self-disclosure 

00:41:35
DR. NITA TEWARI Okay, I can understand that. When I first started teaching, I was a nervous wreck. I was really worried about how I was going to come across, and I had anxiety and the only way to overcome that is just being prepared and, uh, I'd love to help you build up your confidence in teaching. 

00:41:50
Mentor Practices Providing opportunities Being proactive 

00:41:55
DR. NITA TEWARI I have an idea for you. How about, um, how would you like to co-teach Asian-American psychology with me next semester? 

00:42:00
CYNTHIA MEDINA Wow! That would be great. I would love that. 

00:42:00
DR. NITA TEWARI Okay. 

00:42:00
CYNTHIA MEDINA I just - I don't know how to put together a syllabus though. 

00:42:05
Mentor Practices Providing practical support Being proactive 

00:42:05
DR. NITA TEWARI Don't worry about the syllabus. I've got, um, an old copy of a syllabus from last semester, so I have your email address. How about I get it off, uh, my laptop and send you the syllabus for you to review and then once you get a chance to review it, you can come back and talk to me. 

00:42:20
CYNTHIA MEDINA (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:42:20
DR. NITA TEWARI And you also don't have to worry about the specifics, about like what you're going to teach or anything. I'll give you very concrete, very specific ideas once you review the syllabus about how to go and teach - 

00:42:35
CYNTHIA MEDINA (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:42:35
DR. NITA TEWARI The lectures. 

00:42:35
CYNTHIA MEDINA (crosstalk)Great. Thank you so much! 

00:42:35
DR. NITA TEWARI Does that sound good? 

00:42:35
CYNTHIA MEDINA Yes. Perfect. 

00:42:35
DR. NITA TEWARI All right. Let me send it you right now. 

00:42:35
Mentor Practices Creating supportive networks Providing opportunities Talking about race and culture Being proactive 

00:42:40
DR. NITA TEWARI So another thing that I was thinking about it the National Latino Latina Psychological Association Conference. Have you ever been to that? 

00:42:45
CYNTHIA MEDINA No I haven't. 

00:42:45
DR. NITA TEWARI Okay. I really recommend that you go to that. 

00:42:50
CYNTHIA MEDINA (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:42:50
Mentor Practices Creating supportive networks Talking about race and culture 

00:42:50
DR. NITA TEWARI And it would be a great opportunity for you to go and find out, um, how people present and it would be a wonderful way for you to meet other Latinos and Latinas who share similar interests with you. 

00:43:00
Mentor Practice Revealing unwritten rules 

00:43:00
DR. NITA TEWARI And, not only that, when you go there and you network and you meet people, it's also good to know people for the future because you never know what kind of future job possibilities or prospects might happen. 

00:43:15
CYNTHIA MEDINA Right. I would love to go. How much does it cost though? 

00:43:15
DR. NITA TEWARI It actually doesn't cost that much. 

00:43:20
CYNTHIA MEDINA Okay. 

00:43:20
Mentor Practices Providing practical support Being proactive 

00:43:20
DR. NITA TEWARI But I - what I'd like you to do is apply for the scholarship to attend the MLPA and, um, you could just go online, you know how to do research. Go online and find out what the, um, opportunities are for scholarships are for students. 

00:43:30
Mentor Practice Providing practical support 

00:43:30
DR. NITA TEWARI Another thing that you could do, too besides a scholarship option, is sometimes, to go to conferences, you can register as a volunteer. And if you register as a volunteer for the conference, they'll waive your registration fee. 

00:43:45
CYNTHIA MEDINA Okay. 

00:43:45
DR. NITA TEWARI So that's another way. 

00:43:45
CYNTHIA MEDINA Okay. 

00:43:45
Mentor Practices Providing practical support Being proactive 

00:43:45
DR. NITA TEWARI And then if for any reason the scholarship thing doesn't work out, um, the volunteer opportunities are filled, then, um, come back and talk to me and we'll try and come up with some creative ways of how you can still be able to attend the conference. Maybe your department can, like, foot half the, um, money for it and maybe we can figure out another way to, um, get some funding. So, either way, you know, get back to me and let me know what you find out about that. 

00:44:15
CYNTHIA MEDINA Okay. Great. 

00:44:15
Mentor Practices Endorsing Being proactive 

00:44:15
DR. NITA TEWARI Okay, so another thing, when you apply for the scholarship, I'll be happy to write you a letter of recommendation. 

00:44:20
Mentor Practices Creating supportive networks Being proactive 

00:44:20
DR. NITA TEWARI And if you are able to make the conference and attend it, I know the people on the executive board, so I'd love to introduce you to the people, so you get to meet them. 

00:44:30
Mentor Practice Giving time 

00:44:30
CYNTHIA MEDINA This is great. Thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate you spending all this quality time with me. 

00:44:35
Mentor Practice Providing opportunities 

00:44:35
CYNTHIA MEDINA All I came for was for feedback on my paper and you've provided all these great opportunities. I'm really excited. Uh, I can't thank you enough. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. 

00:44:45
Mentor Practice Being true to one's word 

00:44:45

00:44:50

[music] 

00:45:10
Accessibility 

00:45:10
NARRATOR You've just seen a demonstration of good mentoring. Let's take a moment to review just a few of the many critical differences between the two mentors such as their willingness to be accessible to the mentees. 

00:45:20
Handling Mistakes 

00:45:20
NARRATOR The way they handled their mistakes. 

00:45:25
DR. MALUS You should have reminded me. 

00:45:25
DR. NITA TEWARI I'm sorry about that. 

00:45:25
CYNTHIA MEDINA It's okay. 

00:45:25
Willingness to Listen 

00:45:25
NARRATOR Their willingness to listen. 

00:45:30
Providing Quality Feedback 

00:45:30
NARRATOR Their willingness to provide quality feedback. 

00:45:30
DR. MALUS They have a really good writing center on campus somewhere over there. Why don't you just go? 

00:45:35
DR. NITA TEWARI But then as you continue to write, I started to kind of lose you because you introduced a whole another thesis statement. So what's good is you have enough content here for this paper. 

00:45:50
Giving Time 

00:45:50
NARRATOR Their willingness to make time for their mentees. 

00:45:50
DR. MALUS I have a class to teach in five minutes. 

00:45:55
CYNTHIA MEDINA I just had a great meeting with Dr. Tewari. She is amazing. She spent such good quality time with me. I am so impressed. 

00:46:00
Talking about Race and Culture 

00:46:00
NARRATOR And last but not least, their willingness to talk about racial and cultural concerns. 

00:46:05
RAMAR HENDERSON It was really, um, there's really been some really harsh things happening towards the black student population on campus and it's really been really bothering me and kind of effecting me being able to, uh, focus. 

00:46:20
DR. NITA TEWARI Yeah. I heard about that incident that happened in class and I'm sorry that that happened. You would think that in a psychology class and that being even a multi-cultural psychology class that that wouldn't have happened. But unfortunately, these things do happen.

00:46:40
MENTEE MENTOR Relationship Building & Maintaining Trust 

00:46:45
NARRATOR First, she established trust with Cynthia by being open about herself. This encouraged Cynthia to be open as well. 

00:46:50
Cynthia Medina Mentee Elizabeth Robey Interviewer 

00:46:50
ELIZABETH ROBEY How did you feel when she talked a little bit about herself - when she revealed a few things? 

00:46:55
CYNTHIA MEDINA That made me feel a lot more comfortable to just kind of loosen up and, um, share more about myself. Um, she's great at just really, um, providing a reciprocal, um, relationship and not only expecting me to share about myself and not only being curious about me but also willing to share about herself, her background, her experiences and, um, and her - about herself as a career woman, as a mother, and, uh, it really allows me to see what it's like to be a woman in this field. Not only a woman, but a woman of color and the different demands and so it means a lot. It really helps me build the trust. 

00:47:35

NARRATOR Second, Dr. Tewari develops Cynthia's career by offering opportunities to enhance her skills such as giving her the chance to co-teach and telling her about a Latino Latina Conference. Very importantly, Dr. Tewari was proactive in offering these opportunities. She took the initiative to think a few steps ahead and offer career suggestions that Cynthia herself might not have thought of.

00:48:00
ELIZABETH ROBEY Why is it important to offer her ideas and opportunities without her having to ask for them? Why is that important? 

00:48:05
DR. NITA TEWARI (crosstalk)Because students don't know what to ask. They just have no idea what's out there, what's available, what opportunities exist. So I feel like it's the responsibility of the faculty member to be able to share with what's out there. So if you don't know what to ask, you're not going to get the information that you received. 

00:48:25
ELIZABETH ROBEY Right. 

00:48:25
DR. NITA TEWARI Sometimes, you know, students can be shy. They can be embarrassed and they don't want to infringe upon the faculty member's time, so they're ambivalent about asking the questions. 

00:48:30
ELIZABETH ROBEY Right. 

00:48:35
DR. NITA TEWARI Yeah.

NARRATOR Third, Dr. Tewari helped Cynthia navigate issues in her school environment by advocating for her when she had a run-in with a professor. 

00:48:40
ELIZABETH ROBEY Why is it important in, in this, um, scenario that you listen to her describe the racial incident? 

00:48:50
DR. NITA TEWARI Well I think it was important because I think it would have placed Cynthia in a really vulnerable position if she went and approached the faculty member herself about what went down in class because the truth is, the faculty member is in a position of power and in the position of power it can impact her grade, it can impact, um, a future potential letter of recommendation if she needs it or what not. So, since I'm a peer and a colleague with that particular faculty member, I think it is, you know, my job, my role, my responsibility to be able to talk to the faculty member and she needs to feel listened to and heard and I know her a lot better than Dr. Malus might know her.

00:49:40
CYNTHIA MEDINA I think her mentoring will have a huge impact. She is introducing me to a lot of the psychologists out in the field, um, especially the Latino community which means a lot to me because I am Latina and want to meet others, uh, others who share similar values, uh, backgrounds and so, um, I think that it will broaden my network, it will really, um, allow me to persist and, uh, reach my goals, um, and, uh, meet others who are willing to also guide me and mentor me along the way in addition to Dr. Tewari.

Cynthia Medina Mentee Elizabeth Robey Interviewer 

00:50:30
ELIZABETH ROBEY What do you thin of the way she mentored you as a person of color, as a Latina? 

00:50:35
CYNTHIA MEDINA I feel like she really acknowledged, um, the cultural piece, uh, for example, the racial incident that happened with Dr. Mauls. She, um, validated how I was feeling as a Latina when I shared my experience in the classroom and, um, did not not disregard it at all and, um, I can tell that she really cares about me and wants me to grow and, uh, expand my network. I really want to meet other Latinas and Latinos in the field and I had never been to NPA and so the fact that she told me about it and not only introduced me to this, but offered to write me a letter of recommendation and support me with , um, volunteer opportunities, it really meant a lot.

GOOD MENTORING = Awareness + Building relationship + Coaching + Development + Emotional and practical support + Facilitation 

00:51:15
NARRATOR As you can see from the second role play, the ABCs of good mentoring are A, having an awareness of the mentee's cultural identities and understanding how cultural and racial concerns affect them. B, building a solid relationship with mentees by being dependable and open and by spending time with them to get to know who they are and who they want to be. C, coaching their development by providing quality feedback, teaching skills, building their confidence, showing them the ropes and being a good role model. D, developing their support networks and systems as well as discussing and expanding their goals and dreams for themselves. E, extending emotional and practical support when needed and F, facilitating their progress by proactively offering opportunities, endorsing them, explaining unwritten rules and providing protection if necessary. 

00:52:10
MENTORING BENEFITS MENTORS 

00:52:10
NARRATOR Mentoring might take up a little of your time, but mentors often report that working with mentees is one of the most satisfying and rewarding parts of their work. Research has shown that those that mentor not only experience greater meaning and enthusiasm to their work, but also enjoy richer professional networks and feel a greater sense of fulfillment. Let's hear from our mentors about the benefits they get. 

00:52:35
DR. JOSEPH WHITE One of the benefits that I get from being a mentor is that I, is that I am in a continuous learning process because each new generation that comes into training for the profession brings in with them the latest theories, the latest tools, the latest techniques, so by interacting with them, I'm picking up on what's emerging within the field. So while I'm transmitting what already exists in the field and what I've done to them, they're exchanging with me the new ideas, so it's continuing growth process. Uh, the second thing that I think it's added to my enrichment is the process of seeing them grow and come to the next level. So now I have mentees who are college presidents, mentees who are vice-chancellors of student affairs. In fact, some of them are in role-reversal and they've become my boss. So that's been very fulfilling to watch them move from early apprentices in the field to journey men, journey women, and into senior people in the field who are writing books, contributing to the knowledge flow. 

00:53:45
MENTORING BENEFITS MENTORS 

00:53:45
DR. NITA TEWARI It is fulfilling because I have the opportunity to expand my own professional network and it gives me the opportunity to create collegial relationships when my students transition into becoming professionals. 

00:53:55
MENTORING BENEFITS MENTORS 

00:54:00
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Tremendous sense of pride, um, affirmation, um, like you really are making a difference and fulfilling a legacy, like you're making a contribution. Um, but also you're helping them to crystallize their own, you know, sense of potential, but also understand that they can be a teaching and a healing presence in the lives of other people. So it's one of the best feelings in the world really. 

00:54:25
MENTORING BENEFITS INSTITUTIONS 

00:54:25
NARRATOR Mentoring not only benefits mentees and mentors, it can also reap rewards for the departments, schools, and organizations where mentoring takes place. 

00:54:35
DR. JOSEPH WHITE I think the institutional and organizational benefits of mentoring involves a continuous process of renewal and for an organization to grow and develop, just like a person to grow and develop, they have to go through a process periodically of renewal or else they will stagnate. So as the mentees now come into the organization, they come in with the latest of the skill pool. They come in with renewed energy, renewed determination and they are then able to help the inter - uh, the organization grow to its next level. 

00:55:10
MENTORING BENEFITS INSITUTIONS 

00:55:15
DR. THOMAS PARHAM Anybody who thinks mentoring is not important, I think, makes, uh, uh, a huge mistake. It benefits in several ways. Number one, uh, it increases the number of people who finish the institution and complete their academic requirements, so it creates a broader cadre of alums who were there. Two, it endears a student to that institution, because that emotional connection that a student has is not to a building or piece of concrete, it really is to the individual and the way in which they were able to connect to that mentor in authentic ways. So, um, I've been a product of several universities in my life, University of California at Irvine to Washington University in St. Louis and to Southern Illinois and while I am very beholden to each of those institutions for the academic degrees that I've obtained and the exposure that I've had at those institutions, what is the most endearing part of those academic experiences is not the walls and the buildings but the people who helped to mentor me in those particular spaces. So, what the mentors have done is help to create a sense of allegiance to that institution that otherwise might not have been there had the mentor not have been a part of my life. And I think that's what institutions, I think, um, fail to recognize sometimes, um, you know, when they don't honor and, I think, respect really what mentors do in the lives of trying to cultivate the lives of these younger generations of students. 

00:56:30
Recruiting and Graduating Ethnic Minorities and Other Underrepresented Groups 

00:56:35
NARRATOR According to Dr. Parham, mentoring is also essential for institutions wanting to recruit as well as retain and graduate ethnic minorities and other underrepresented groups. 

00:56:45
DR. THOMAS PARHAM So let me talk specifically about really students who are underrepresented and, and ethnic students in particular. They come into institutions, like these major research born universities around the country and are, uh, thrown into climates that sometimes they are not used to be or, or very competitive or in some cases, hostile. But also, see they take a posture that places them in a marginalized position because it's so difficult for them to see themselves reflected in the fabric of the institution. So an institution's job is not simply to recruit and yield those folk who then enroll, the institutions have to take a great deal of pride at being able to finish folk. See, to me, it doesn't increase your academic credibility because you can flunk out 35% of the people and only the best survive, that's an indictment, if you will, on institutions of higher education in my opinion. What you've really got to be able to do is, to provide a mechanism within the institutional walls that allow you to create that nurturing environment that we talked about before. So, when we talk about the recruitment of some of these students, getting them here is the easy part. Keeping them here and allowing them to then, uh, uh, nurture their dreams and aspirations within the confines of that environment, both within curricular and co-curricular ways, is really what the hard part is. So mentoring is essential and the irony is that in lots of institutions, whether they're research ones or not, what they judge faculty on are research productivity, teaching excellence in the classroom and the evaluations you get as well as university service, but rarely does mentoring students and helping students really move through that pipeline get counted, I think, as, as, uh, uh, an asset in terms of a faculty member's dossier. But it is perhaps, I think, one of the most important roles that a faculty member or even a senior administrator like me plays within the context of the work we do in higher education. 

00:58:55
DR. ANNE CHAN As you can see from the testimony of these mentors, mentoring reaps multiple rewards, not only for the mentee, but for mentors and for departments and institutions where quality mentoring happens. I believe in mentoring so much that I want to encourage everyone to get a mentor, and to try mentoring somebody else in your life, whether that person is in your workplace, school, religious institution or community. 

00:59:20
Mentoring Makes a Difference 

00:59:20
DR. ANNE CHAN It doesn't take a whole lot of your time, but it can make a real impact in another persons life. 

00:59:25
"I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." 

00:59:30
DR. ANNE CHAN In the words of the great Dr. Maya Angelou, I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. So, I strongly encourage all of you to try mentoring and making a real difference in another person's life.
