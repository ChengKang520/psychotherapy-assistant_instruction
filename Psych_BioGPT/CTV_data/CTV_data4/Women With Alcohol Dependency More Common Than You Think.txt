00:00:20
NARRATOR Independence, glamour, romance--the life of a successful American women near the start of the new century, and the images used by wine and liquor advertisers trying to boost sales to a female demographic. Most women who use alcohol use it safely. But when alcohol is a problem not all genders are created equal. 

00:00:45
ELAINE GUSTAFSON A man is looked at when he's drunk as, Oh that’s just Joe and he is out having a good time on a Friday night as opposed to if Elaine's out at a bar and she's drunk, she is a bad person and she must be loose and she must be easy. 

00:00:55
75% of all sexual assaults involve alcohol. 

00:01:05
PATRICE MUCHOWSKI We get cirrhosis faster. We have more severe liver disease. It affects our reproductive abilities. It creates depression. 

00:01:10
CATHY MITCHELL Can you read what, how to make this? I kept focusing on the drugs. It's more about the drugs, you know. I had used heroin, for God's sake. What about the drugs? And it was explained to me that the worst drug I could have possibly used was alcohol. 

00:01:30
DARTMOUTH-HITCHCOCK MEDICAL CENTER Prescription for Learning Women with Alcohol Dependency: More Common than You Think GOVERNMENT WARNING” (1) ACCORDING TO THE SURGEON GENERAL, WOMEN SHOULD NOT DRINK ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES DURING PREGNANCY BECAUSE OF THE RISK OF BIRTH DEFECTS (2) CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES IMPAIRS YOUR ABILITY TO DRIVE A CAR OR OPERATE MACHINERY, AND MAY CAUSE HEALTH PROBLEMS 

00:01:40
NARRATOR We’ve all seen the warning, it's on every alcoholic beverage container sold in the United States. According to the US surgeon general, women should not drink during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. But if a women isn’t pregnant should she be any more concerned about using alcohol than a man? Let's look at a hypothetical couple. We’ll call them Margaret and Steve. Both in their 30s, reasonably fit, they're about the same body weight. They only use alcohol in the evening and during the time it takes to prepare dinner and enjoy their meal together they share a bottle of wine. That’s four glasses each, the same amount of alcohol; but if this is a daily habit, the chances they're taking with their health are very different. The alcohol in the wine will affect Margaret’s brain faster and longer. The potential damage to her major organs is much greater. For Steve significant liver damage begins at six drinks a day but Margaret reaches the same risk level at just two daily drinks. This also puts Margaret at greater risk for vitamin deficiencies, osteoporosis, heart disease and several types of cancer. Taking into account all causes of alcohol related deaths including accidents, Margaret is twice as likely to die this year than as Steve just because she is drinking four glasses of wine a day--the same amount as her husband. There are two major reasons why a women’s body is more sensitive to alcohol. First there is a natural enzyme found in the lining of the stomach called alcohol dehydrogenase or ADH. ADH is a chemical that breaks down alcohol. 

00:03:15
Alcohol Dehydrogenase ADH 

00:03:15
NARRATOR Men typically have much more ADH in their stomachs than women. So for men more alcohol is neutralized in the stomach before it enters the blood stream. The other reason a women’s body is more sensitive to alcohol is because her body tissue contains less water than a man’s. Alcohol mixes with water so with less water a women’s body does not dilute the alcohol as well. This means that a women drinking the same amount of alcohol as a man will have a higher blood alcohol level. 

00:03:50
ELAINE GUSTAFSON Up higher… just a li-, perfect. Perfect. 

00:03:50
NARRATOR Elaine Gustafson(ph) was 15 when she discovered alcohol. 

00:03:55
ELAINE GUSTAFSON I remember that I liked it right away. I liked the way it made me feel, I liked the way it made me come out of myself and I couldn’t wait to do it again. 

00:04:05
NARRATOR After high school Elaine applied to enter a college nursing program but was rejected. It was a major disappointment. So she took a job as a nurse's aid and soon began spending her evenings in nightclubs and bars. 

00:04:20
ELAINE GUSTAFSON I felt like this is what I like to do. I like to go out, I like to dance and the alcohol kind of medicated a lot of feelings and got me out of myself. So I thought that I have found the answer. 

00:04:35
NARRATOR At AdCare hospital a drug and alcohol treatment center in Worcester, Massachusetts, Dr. Patrice Muchowski is vice-president of clinical services. Dr. Muchowski says that Elaine Gustafson’s increasing preoccupation with alcohol was one of the signs that she was developing alcoholism, which in clinical terms is called alcohol dependence. 

00:04:55
PATRICE MUCHOWSKI , ScD AdCare Hospital Worcester, Massachusetts Dependence refers to really three key mark variables. One is the person experiences a loss of control over the use of their substance. The person has a preoccupation with their substance and the person continues to use in spite of adverse consequences. 

00:05:10
NARRATOR Elaine’s loss of control over her use of alcohol was obvious when she compared her behavior to that of her friends. 

00:05:15
ELAINE GUSTAFSON I’d have 13 drinks and… and they would have three and I thought, there is something wrong with this picture. Why can't I just have a couple of drinks? And I'd promise myself before I went out I'm just gonna have two or three drinks and that’s it and I’m gonna go home and one drink, two drinks, three drinks, back to thirteen again, back to drunk. 

00:05:35
PATRICE MUCHOWSKI One of the things that we know is habitual use of alcohol and other drugs creates both um, structural and biochemical changes in the brain and it actually changes the way that the whole neuro-transmission system works and one simple way to look at it is that, it's sort of like a switch gets flipped in the brain, moving you from, say, abuse to addiction or abuse to dependence and once this… this switch flips it can't flip back again. The brain is saying I’m used to this substance, it's helping me function normally, you’ve taken it away, you need to do something about this. 

00:06:15
ELAINE GUSTAFSON I tried a couple of times, I took a vacation from work for a week and I thought this is it, I’m gonna get myself together here and straighten out and change my life and I tried to do and it just didn’t work. I woke up one morning after taking one of those weeks off from work and I had done nothing that whole week but drink and not take care of myself and pulled a dirty wrinkled white uniform out of the hamper and I walked in to work and they took one look at me and they said Elaine what is wrong? I said I don’t know what's wrong with me. I feel like I’m having a nervous breakdown. I was so desperate that I called my mother at work and she said to me, "Elaine, you're not having a nervous breakdown, it’s the alcohol that’s doing this to you and I’ve been trying to tell you this for a while," and right away denial kicked in and I said, "It's not the alcohol, I’m having a breakdown," and I hung up. 

00:07:05
NARRATOR Her mother’s insistence that drinking was the problem eventually did get through to Elaine. 

00:07:10
ELAINE GUSTAFSON So I called back my mother and in a very sarcastic way I said, "If alcohol is my problem what am I supposed to do about it?" And she said to me, "Well," she said, "I think you should go talk to the priest down at the church where your father and I go to mass," and I thought I'm not going to see a priest, a priest is not gonna help me. 

00:07:30
NARRATOR But the next day, Elaine felt even worse. So she did go to her priest. 

00:07:30
ELAINE GUSTAFSON He kept questioning me about my drinking which I thought was a little strange because I really thought that the alcohol was the glue that was keeping me together and certainly don’t take that away because if you take that away I’ll definitely fall apart. But he finally at the end of about an hour got me to admit that perhaps alcohol was a problem and that perhaps maybe I should seek some help for that. 

00:08:00
What a nice day! 

00:08:05
NARRATOR Cathy Mitchell’s life has returned to where it began--in an affluent Maryland suburb. Growing up she was one of seven children in a family that was well-known and liked by the community. Her father, a popular and well-respected restauranteur, had a talent for meeting and greeting the public and he was an alcoholic. 

00:08:25
CATHY MITCHELL Growing up in an alcoholic family in the 50’s and 60’s, every celebration involved alcohol. If we had a christening, a wedding, you know, a graduation, a dinner party, whatever it was… it… it involved alcohol. So I think that I viewed alcohol as a very grown-up think to do. But I also had an environment I mean, when I was growing up it was the Woodstock era. So it was drugs, sex, rock and roll, if it feels good do it. Of course I found myself pregnant, tenth grade at the time and I got clean to have a healthy baby and what clean meant back in 1970 was no using any drugs, I knew that was bad. No LSD or speed or any of those things, I mean, certainly we had education to tell us that those things shouldn’t be done when you are pregnant. But what I did continue to do was I used some wine. 

00:09:25
NARRATOR Nine months after giving birth to her first child, a son, Cathy became pregnant again. Her second child was a girl named Carly. Cathy’s pregnancies and her drinking continued. 

00:09:35
CATHY MITCHELL I was married to my first husband for almost nine years and we had three children together and every one of those pregnancies was exposed to alcohol. 

00:09:45
Alcohol Dehydrogenase 

00:09:50
NARRATOR Now 35 years later most women know or should know that there are dangerous risks in drinking during pregnancy. At Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire Dr. Michele Lauria is an expert on fetal development. She says the reason a fetus is so sensitive to alcohol has to do with its level of ADH, the enzyme which adult body’s use to metabolize alcohol. 

00:10:15
MICHELE R. LAURIA , MD Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center A fetus only has one-tenth of the amount of ADH as a women has, as an adult has. So the fetus doesn’t have the capacity to metabolize the alcohol. So it just sits around there destroying cells. You know, we… we… we pickle things in alcohol, right? We can preserve things in alcohol. When you get tequila there's that little perfect worm on the bottom. We don’t want to be pickled. 

00:10:40
NARRATOR Cathy eventually gave birth two more times. Her fourth was a son who is premature and lived only a day. Her illegal drug use now included heroin, but when she found out she was pregnant a fifth time she was determined to do the right thing. She left her husband and began methadone treatment for her heroin addiction. 

00:11:00
CATHY MITCHELL I never received any information from that methadone clinic that I shouldn’t be drinking. 

00:11:05
NARRATOR Despite the drinking Cathy gave birth to what appeared to be a healthy baby girl. 

00:11:10
CATHY MITCHELL What happened unfortunately is that um, I went in to her room one day, when she was about, oh I guess um, going on about three months um, and I found her dead. She had died in her crib. And you know they said that my daughter died of SIDS, Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, and uh, made no connection whatsoever to the fact that I um… she was, you know, a methadone baby and exposed to other um, you know, drugs including alcohol, the most dangerous of all during pregnancy. 

00:11:55
NARRATOR Elaine Gustafson decided to listen to her priest’s advice. He introduced her to a older woman who took her to a twelve-step meeting. 

00:12:00
ELAINE GUSTAFSON I listened to the meeting that night and for the first time in my life I felt like I belong somewhere. People got up and told their stories and I sat there in amazement thinking, oh my God this could be me. I had to havae a couple of slips here before I actually put down the drink for good and it's only one day at a time and that’s why A-A teaches one day at a time because we can all relapse. 

00:12:25
NARRATOR 19 years have passed since Elaine’s last relapse. Living one day at a time, she's not only stayed sober, she returned to college, earning a degree and certification as a registered nurse. It’s a career she continues today, working in the substance abuse detox unit of a rehabilitation hospital. Part of building a sober lifestyle has been finding ways to handle stress that don’t require alcohol. 

00:12:55
ELAINE GUSTAFSON Go to the gym four or five times a week. I do aerobics, I do the Nautilus machines, that’s a great stress reliever. Get those endorphins going, that gives you a little bit more self-esteem. 

00:13:05
NARRATOR But the biggest difference in Elaine’s life since she stopped drinking has nothing to do with her activities or her environment. 

00:13:15
ELAINE GUSTAFSON I don’t mind being by myself, with myself um, I’m okay today if I’m still and there's no music or activity around me. I feel comfortable in my own skin today. 

00:13:25
NARRATOR Soon after the death of her daughter, Cathy Mitchell found help from a most surprising source. 

00:13:30
CATHY MITCHELL My father had finally gotten sober. He knew what was going on with me. So rather than saying you make us sick, who are you, we are so embarrassed, ashamed of you, I would get messages from him like, you just have alcoholism and we are gonna help you get treatment but, you know, until you decide that you'll go for help you can't see your kids. You know, you wanna talk about a powerful intervention. 

00:14:05
NARRATOR Cathy lived apart while she was in a residential recovery program and for a year after that while she continued to change her life. 

00:14:15
This one and then that'll… 

00:14:15
Okay. 

00:14:15
NARRATOR Two years into her sobriety Cathy was living again with her three children including her daughter Carly, who at the time was 16. Since Carly was a toddler she’d had developmental problems but various professionals over the years could never come up with a consistent diagnosis. But one day when Cathy was studying to be an addictions counselor, she attended a lecture about babies whose mothers had used crack cocaine during pregnancy. 

00:14:40
CATHY MITCHELL And there they were: all the symptoms that Carly had. I thought(ph), how could this be? They are explaining exactly how Carly was as an infant but I didn’t use crack cocaine. I’m thinking what did I use? I used alcohol, I used wine. So I went to the library that day and I looked up what wine could do to a fetus and I saw it, it was called fetal alcohol syndrome. And of course I should explain that that early report on crack cocaine they did not figure in that a lot of these moms that used crack had used alcohol. So they had to come back years later and modify their statements and really what they were reporting on were alcohol-related birth defects. 

00:15:20
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) • Facial abnormalities • Growth deficiency • Central nervous system dysfunction 

00:15:20
NARRATOR Fetal alcohol syndrome or FAS is a medical diagnosis consisting of a specific set of birth defects that can result because of alcohol use during pregnancy. 

00:15:35
PATRICE MUCHOWSKI Fetal alcohol syndrome is the most common cause of mental retardation. 

00:15:35
Disorders that may result from alcohol use during pregnancy: • Asperger’s Disorder • Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) • Autistic Disorder • Borderline Personality Disorder • Conduct Disorder • Depression • Learning Disability • Oppositional-Defiant Disorder • Post Traumatic Stress Disorder • Receptive-Expressive Language Disorder 

00:15:40
NARRATOR But in addition to FAS, alcohol use during pregnancy can cause a wide range of other injuries to the fetus. 

00:15:45
MICHELE R. LAURIA This is entirely preventable. There is no known level of safe alcohol use in pregnancy. So our recommendation is that women completely abstain from alcohol use in pregnancy. 

00:15:55
NARRATOR Once Carly’s condition was correctly diagnosed and understood, Cathy shifted her focus from thinking about her daughter’s limitatins and instead looked at what Carly can do. It turns out there is plenty. 

00:16:15
Seven cups of water. 

00:16:15
CATHY MITCHELL Carly volunteered to be my mother’s caretaker and it’s a perfect union because now my mother is in a wheelchair, she is not able to dress herself, she is not able to cook and together the two of them are able to function independently so they are living together now. Carly helps my mother, dress, hlps her to shower, my mother helps Carly to cook. Carly has the mobility in the hands where my mother has the memory and the knowledge to assist that. So together they formed a team and it's what they both want for right now. 

00:16:55
Did you tell your mother what you did (inaudible ) yesterday? 

00:16:56
CARLY Yeah. 

00:17:00
Such a, you're a good worker. 

00:17:00
CARLY Yes I told her. 

00:17:05
CATHY MITCHELL Yeah, if you go on to management… 

00:17:05
NARRATOR Few have learnt a harder lesson than Cathy Mitchell that alcoholism places women at special risks. She is a spokeswomen for the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, bringing out in to the open issues that were once buried in shame. 

00:17:20
CATHY MITCHELL Today, I feel very strongly in the power of honesty, being very factual with women and the idea that it's up to every healthcare professional, every person of the ministry, every person who works in any kind of helping fashion at all, educators, to be honest with people and give them the facts that this is a disease, it's treatable, and this it could be as simple as boy,all the problems you're telling me sound just like alcoholism and to treat it as a disease in a very matter of fact way. I mean, we need to really get past that stigma because what we do is kill women and as you heard from my story, we kill their children when we don’t intervene. 

00:18:10
CAGE Test • Have you ever felt you should Cut down on your drinking? • Have people Annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? • Have you ever felt Guilty about your drinking? • Have you ever had an Eye-opener? 

00:18:10
NARRATOR How can you determine if you have a problem? One method is called the CAGE test. CAGE is an acronym to help you remember. Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking? Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? Have you ever felt guilty about your drinking? And have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning, an eye-opener to study your nerves or get rid of a hangover? If your answer is yes to one of these questions you might have a drinking problem. If your answer is yes to two or more of the questions it's highly likely that you do have a problem, so you should see your physician or a mental health counselor. Another resource is Alcoholic Anonymous or AA, which you can find in any phone book. 

00:19:00
ELAINE GUSTAFSON Sometimes all I have to do is tell people that I’m an alcoholic and I’m in recovery and I get true confessions. Well, you know I drink three or four drinks a night and I get in trouble when I drink and do you think I have a problem? And I.. I.. have to say to them when you drink, does it do X Y and Z? When you drink, do you find yourself in the places that you wouldn’t normally be in? When you drink, do you find that… that you associate with people that you wouldn’t normally associate with? And I ask a few different questions and a lot of times I get yes answers and then I just say to that person, "Why don’t you come an A-A meeting with me and you decide if you think you have a problem."
