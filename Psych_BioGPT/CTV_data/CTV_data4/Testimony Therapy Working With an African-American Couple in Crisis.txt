MAKUNGU AKINYELA Hi, I'm Dr. Makungu Akinyela. I'm a marriage and family therapist in Atlanta, Georgia, and today I want to talk to you about testimony therapy. Testimony therapy is a discursive or storytelling therapy that's grounded in the history, culture, and traditions of the African-American community. As a storytelling therapy, it's related to narrative therapy, to just therapy from New Zealand, to solution focused therapy. It's in the same ball park, and so even though it's grounded in a specific culture tradition, as I believe most therapies are, hopefully today you'll be able to see how you can use some of these methods, some of these approaches in your own work, no matter which community you are a part of. Testimony therapy is a discursive or storytelling therapy, also, I think it's important to point out that it's communitarian, as opposed to what some people might call a post-modern therapeutic approach. It emphasizes the person within the community and the social construction and cultural mediation of the stories that constitute the life of the person in the community. Now, you might say, "Well, what does that really mean?" Often times, the way we've been taught to think about therapy is in terms of what we might call internal state psychology. The idea that's really grounded in the sayings of Descartes, "I think, therefore I am." In a similar way to postmodern ideas, but I say communitarian because this is not, this is grounded in a particular cultural perspective, we say that the idea of the person is in community. The person is in the community, and the community is in the person. An African centered thought counter to Descartes' I think, therefore I am would be I am because we are, and because we are, therefore I am. In other words, I know I exists because I see myself in you, I see myself in the community. This is what we mean when we say that testimony is a communitarian approach to therapy. There are eight basic principles that I believe define testimony therapy. One, testimony therapy is rooted in the history of African descendant peoples. In other words, we gain our metaphors, we gain our knowledges, our ideas about what healing conversations are about from those traditions that come from black people, particularly those black people of the U.S. Testimony, secondly, privileges the experiences, the stories, the understandings, and the meanings that community gives to everyday life and life experiences. Thirdly, testimony honors the spiritual traditions of African descendant peoples. Some of you might recognize that even the metaphor of testimony is not grounded in legal theory, as some people might think, but it's grounded in the spiritual tradition of Black people inside the United States. To testify or testifying is to tell the story of your life as you hope and wish that your community will understand you, to testify. Testimony therapy fosters connections with family and community, utilizing processes of call and response to thicken testimonies of hope, and call and response and oral tradition, there are two processes to constructing a story. There's the storyteller and there's the witness, and the participation of the witness is just as important to this story construction as the storyteller. Again, if you're used to being around people from oral traditions or if you've ever been inside and had a black church experience, you notice it's not just the story that's told, it's not just the preaching that goes, but the "Amen," or the "That's right" that's just as important as the story that's being told. That contributes to the construction of the story itself. Next we say that testimony therapy is emotional. It creates space for the expression of grief, anger, and joy that traditionally has been denied African-American people. This idea that somehow emotions have to be bridled in an controlled, whereas, in testimony, we want to create a space where people are able to express their emotions, their sense of joy or even outrage from a particular experience in the story that they're telling. Next, we say that testimony therapy creates space for recovery and celebration of resilience and creativity stories through healing circles and witnessing of testimony. What I mean by that is the whole objective of the testimony therapist is to create a space of freedom. A space where people can celebrate their victorious moments within the story, even though the story may begin with and seem to be dominated by doom and gloom, what narrative therapists would call a thin telling of the story, we thicken the story by focusing on those victorious moments, those points, those high points in the story that seem to contradict the doom and gloom of the story. Next, we say that testimony therapy is guided by the oral tradition, and it relies on the rhythms of black music, which is a part of that oral tradition as a guiding metaphor to shape therapeutic conversations. What I mean by that is a testimony therapist focuses on the rhythm and the beat of conversation, understand that the rhythm of a conversation can have as much importance as the subject of the conversation, that being aware of the rhythm of a conversation. The testimony therapist might ask himself or herself, "Hmm, is this a blues conversation or is this a jazz conversation? Or with a young person it might even be a hip-hop conversation." The rhythm is just as important, because again, to get into the flow of the rhythm of that conversation creates a connectedness and a relationship between the storyteller, in this instance, perhaps the client, and the witness, the therapist. Testimony therapy finally is pragmatic, and what I believe is the best African tradition. What do I mean by that? Testimony therapy is not ideological. Sometimes we have to use what works. That means that testimony therapists don't deny the possibility that other approaches to therapy might be useful in this particular moment. We understand from research that 40% of what works in all therapies across the board is the relationship between the therapist and the client, and so, and that only about 15% of what works across all therapies is your particular theory of therapy, and so testimony are not hung up on just using one particular approach. Pragmatism becomes a very powerful and a useful idea within testimony therapy. We say that within testimony therapy that there are five key aspects to that therapy. One is this idea of the notion of self. I talked about it a little a little bit earlier, but this becomes very important in understanding what we mean, we talk about communitarian approaches to therapy. As I said before, in traditional Western therapy, particularly prior to the development of so called postmodern therapists or therapies there was a heavy reliance on this idea of internal state psychology. The idea that we exist inside our heads, and again, I think that is best demonstrated, if you remember your Philosophy 101 class, Descartes; "I think, therefore I am." What does that mean, really? It means I know I exist because I have thoughts, because I can feel myself existing inside my head, and that idea has become very important to Western ideas of what the person is and who the person is. It says that I stand alone as an individual, and that has become so important that many of us have learned that the goal of good therapy is what? To help a person to individuate, to help a person to become one who is able to stand alone on their own, by themselves. In fact, we even get judged in school in terms of whether we're able to work well alone. Alright, on the other hand, perhaps there are other cultural ways of understanding the person, and that's the argument that testimony therapy makes. As a communitarian approach to therapy, as a therapy that's grounded in oral traditions. The argument is that there may be another way of understanding the existence of the self. John Embidie, the author of African Religions and Philosophy said that an African way of thinking about that would be: I am because we are, and because we are, therefore I am. In southern Africa it's called Imbutu. A person is a person, because they are people, in other words, I know I exists not because I exist in my head, but because I can see myself in you, and what that suggests to us, that the person, the self exists not in our heads, but somewhere in between the relationship between you and me in the community, that has deep ramifications as to how as a therapist we work towards helping people to feel better in themselves and in their community, that our objective is not so much helping people to individuate, but to help people come into community in a more healthy way. Secondly, testifying and witnessing. Postmodernists would talk about the social construction of stories, we say that in communitarian cultures, that social constructions of stories happens between the testimony and the witness. I mentioned earlier about the black church experience. If you've ever been to a testimony service, you know that most of those services start with someone telling a story, and it's often what narrative therapists would call a thin telling. What, in testimony therapy, we call a doom and gloom telling of the story, it always starts with what the problem is. I got sick one day, and everyone told me that I was going to die, and usually even then, in that service, there's a response to that, no one sits in silence. Somebody says, "Well." As the story gets told, and it continues to get told, there's encouragement from the community to tell the story. As the story's told, we also, though, begin to hear victorious moments; "Even though I was sick, I had my friend who came and sat with me, and I felt good to know that my friend was there." There's an "Amen," there's a response to that, that's called a victorious moment. That means that even in the middle of the doom and gloom, there's something good that happened. Again, narrative therapists might say that that's the part of the story that contradicts the thin telling of the story. As the story goes on, there's more response to the call. There's more response to the story, and those responses also give direction to how the story goes. There's encouragement to look for those victorious moments, and so testifying and witnessing. The social construction of story happens not in a person's head, but in the relationship between the storyteller and the witness to the story, so that there, the story is constructed by a community, not by an individual. That becomes an important thing. What that means to a testimony therapist is that we realize our significance to the construction of our client's stories, we're a part of the story, itself, simply because of their presence with us in that moment. Thirdly, there's the idea of nurturing hopefulness by identifying the victorious moments. As a therapist, one of the most important things you can to do is learn to instill hopefulness, even in the saddest of stories, even in the worst of doom and gloom. It becomes our work as therapists to learn to instill hopefulness. Hopefulness might be a placebo, but it helps our clients have a sense of the ability to hold on from one day to the next, and so nurturing hopefulness by identifying those victorious moments, what that means, that as a therapist, we're not simply listening and looking for the problem, we're not seeking to diagnose problems, we're looking for solutions in the midst of the story, and so an important skill of the testimony therapist is to learn to listen for the victorious moments, even in the midst of those things that seem problematic, we want to find the contradiction to the problem. We want to find the strength that's exhibited even in the weakest telling of the story, that becomes an important skill. Fourthly, an aspect of testimony therapy is what we call the four healing questions. You'll see an example of those four healing questions. Those questions become very important. Those four healing questions that guide the direction of a story, that the therapist is participating in with the client. First of all, what happened to you? That becomes important, that question is important, because one thing that it does is it helps a client to ground their story in space and time. Often times when people come to us to have a conversation about problems they're having, they're uncertain about exactly what the problem is. The problem is often times, even though it truly hurts, it feels abstract to them. by simply asking that question; what happened to you, ten minutes before you call to make this appointment, now the client is able to ground their story in space and time. It gives them a grounding to begin telling the story. The second question that we want to ask in those four healing questions is despite what happened to you, despite how bad it felt, how does what happened to you affect you today? Or, looking at you, how does what happened to you affect you today? When we're asking that question, we also then want to go in alot of different directions with that; how is that affecting you emotionally? How is that affecting your relationships with family members, with community, with friends? How is that affecting your relationship even to yourself? How has that event that has occurred impacted your life today, right now? It helps us to get a sense of exactly where a person feels themselves to be in that moment. The third question we want to ask is looking at what happened to you, and seeing how what happened to you is affecting you right now is affecting you today, what has given you the strength to carry on? That's an important question. Often times when people are in emotional pain, when they're in relational pain, they don't realize that they have carried on, they don't realize that they exist, that they are here today. To ask that question invites a person to reflect on their ability to survive. It invites them to unpack the things the reasons that they have to continue, and by inviting them to unpack those things, it also helps us as a therapist to realize what the strengths of this person are. What their social strength, sometimes that person may say, "It's my best friends who make me feel supported, to help me carry on." Sometimes that person might say, "I just pray alot." Sometimes that person might say, "It's just this tenacity that I learned from my parents where I refuse to give up." There are no right answers, but each of those answers gives us the possibility of understanding where the victory lies, gives us something to help that person to hold onto for themselves as they go on. And then finally, we want to ask that person in those four healing questions what do you need to heal? What we're asking our client when we ask that question; what's your theory of change? What do you believe it will take to make your world better? And that becomes an important question, because as a therapist we're also saying, "You're the expert in your own life, I may be an expert in therapy, but you're the expert in your life, and I acknowledge your expertise, and I want you to give me your prescription for the change that we're going to work on." That becomes an important invitation, because also it becomes important, I believe, in focusing on client directed work, as opposed to therapist directed work. We want our clients to direct us in what their healing should look like, and by inviting our clients to give us their prescription, we're able then to pinpoint those goals, those things, so that when change does come, we know they're there, because these are the things our client has outlined for us, what looked good if life were better, if their testimony was as they wanted it to be. So those four healing questions are very important in terms of guiding conversation, and finally, the fifth of those five key aspects is paying attention to the rhythm and the beat of the conversation. As I have said, testimony therapy is grounded in orality, or oral traditions, and with communities that are grounded in oral tradition, the rhythm and the beat of a conversation is just as important as the words of a conversation. What this means is that the therapist needs to learn to pay attention to the pace, the rhythm, the beat. The therapist is not only using their words as a part of the healing process, the therapist is also using their whole self. As one of my great mentors, Nancy Boyd Franklin has talked about, the therapist has to use themselves. The use of the self becomes very important. One of the things you'll notice in our next segment, I hope, is that I try to be very aware of the rhythm, the beat, even the body language, not only my clients body language, but my own body language. I try to be aware of my own movement toward or my movement away from the client as very much a part of the conversation, it's not just the words that matter, it's how the words interplay with the pace, the rhythm, the beat, the motion the body language of the conversation. Next, you're going to meet Terry and Shayla. Terry and Shayla are an African-American couple who have come, because they're really struggling with the pressures of trying to maintain a good and healthy marriage against also having to parent a child with special needs, and what they're experiencing is that struggle between a good and healthy relationship and parenting a child with special needs is having a very painful impact on their sense of togetherness with each other. We're going to meet with Terry and Shayla for the very first time, and in that first meeting we are going to hear the story of their relationship. We're going to listen for how they hope that this conversation might be helpful, and we're particularly going to engage in the four healing questions with them, and hopefully you'll be able to see those eight principles and those five key aspects that we've outline previously about testimony therapy, as you witness this conversation. Good morning Shayla and Terry, how are you all doing? 

00:22:40
SHAYLA Good morning, Doctor A, I'm good. 

00:22:45
TERRY Good morning. 

00:22:45
MAKUNGU AKINYELA It's good to meet you all, and it's good that you took some time to come here today. So, why are you here? 

00:23:00
SHAYLA I guess it was my idea, I just think we need somebody to talk to, a mediator or something, because we just don't seem to be on the same page. 

00:23:05
MAKUNGU AKINYELA You're not on the same page? What page are you on? 

00:23:15
SHAYLA I don't know, I just feel like we're stuck in a rut, we just go through the routine, there's really no amorous in our relationship, anymore, you know? And I think we need to get some help before it gets real crazy. 

00:23:30
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Ok, Terry why are you here? 

00:23:35
TERRY If I'm honest with you, Doc, I don't know. 

00:23:40
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Really? 

00:23:40
TERRY I mean, I mean, here's the thing, I married my high school sweetheart, and I think that everything is great, just lately she doesn't seem to be happy, and I don't know why. I don't know what it is that I'm doing or not doing, I mean, I think, I hear what she's saying, I give her what she asks for, and then, that doesn't seem to be even enough. Either I didn't give it to her in the way she asked for, or I didn't give her as much as she was asking for, but I thought I heard her, I met her needs, gave her exactly what it was she wanted, and then she's still not happy. 

00:24:20
MAKUNGU AKINYELA And you good? 

00:24:20
TERRY I'm not happy that she's not happy, but. 

00:24:25
SHAYLA (crosstalk)But are you happy? You not even happy, either. You come straight home and go straight to bed How does that happen? 

00:24:30
TERRY (crosstalk)Because I'm tired, baby, I'm tired. I'm out slaving all day everyday making a great life for you and Micah. 

00:24:40
SHAYLA That we don't have time to enjoy. 

00:24:40
TERRY That's a perfect example of I do something, all I can, try to create a great life, and then it's not enough. 

00:24:50
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Do you enjoy that great life? 

00:24:55
TERRY Absolutely. 

00:24:55
MAKUNGU AKINYELA You do? 

00:24:55
TERRY Yeah. 

00:24:55
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So you're enjoying your life? 

00:24:55
TERRY I mean, when, it's not my life, but I enjoy the life that I think that I'm building with Shayla. 

00:25:00
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay. 

00:25:00
TERRY It's, you know, we have a great place to live, we have a son that needs care, yes, but, I mean, we're able to provide that care, and I mean, she's my high school sweetheart, so. 

00:25:10
SHAYLA But, baby, we haven't been sweethearts since high school, so why do you keep saying that? 

00:25:15
TERRY What do you mean we haven't been sweethearts since high school? 

00:25:20
SHAYLA I don't know, it's that, back that, you're not here in the day to day, because our day to day is miserable, we don't hardly laugh around the house, we don't dance, we don't listen to music, we don't go out anymore, we used to go dancing, we used to try a different restaurant at least once or twice a month. 

00:25:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Why don't you do that anymore? 

00:25:40
TERRY Because we have a son that needs 24 hour care. 

00:25:40
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay. 

00:25:40
TERRY I work, she works to take care of our son. So it's not like I'm stuck back there, but we didn't have the same responsibilities back then that we do now. 

00:25:50
SHAYLA But see, he gets his thrills off by working, his working does not give me my thrills, I don't get excited by that. Yes, I am so grateful that we don't have to worry about getting bills paid, mortgage, that kind of security is priceless, especially given Micah's situation. 

00:26:10
MAKUNGU AKINYELA How old is Micah? 

00:26:10
SHAYLA Micah is five. 

00:26:10
MAKUNGU AKINYELA He's five? 

00:26:10
SHAYLA Yes. 

00:26:10
MAKUNGU AKINYELA What's happening with him? Tell me a little bit about that. 

00:26:15
SHAYLA Well, he has MS, and so he requires 24 hour care, and he's, I'm sorry. He's doing much better, and we have a nurse that comes in, so that helps alot, but up until that point, it was just me, because we couldn't really afford to bring anyone in, so Terry started taking on extra hours and so forth to get the income so that we could get someone in. 

00:26:45
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So he does work really hard? 

00:26:45
SHAYLA Yes. 

00:26:50
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Terry works really hard, and it sounds like you work really hard, too. You're, even with the nurse, you're home with Micah? 

00:26:55
SHAYLA And after being with him all day, and I love my son, but you just want to have somebody to talk to, an adult companionship, somebody I can dream with and build with, and Terry just doesn't seem to understand, and he doesn't care. 

00:27:15
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Terry, do you care? 

00:27:20
TERRY Absolutely. It's crushing to me that Shayla thinks that I don't care, because. 

00:27:30
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So it hurts you that somehow you're not able to, you're not able to convey to your wife how much you love her? 

00:27:40
TERRY Yes. 

00:27:40
MAKUNGU AKINYELA And somehow that hard work that you're doing. 

00:27:45
TERRY (crosstalk)Doesn't look like caring. 

00:27:45
MAKUNGU AKINYELA It doesn't look like, and are you realizing that, that it doesn't look like care? 

00:27:50
TERRY I realize that it's hard for me to understand how she doesn't realize that that is me showing how I care. She has girlfriends who complain, because they have grown husbands who sit on the couch and play video games all day, while they go out and work two jobs. She doesn't have to be concerned about that. That run around and do all these other kinds of things. When I go work, I bring my paycheck home, I bring my time home. I want to be with my wife. 

00:28:25
MAKUNGU AKINYELA When you bring those paychecks home, and you're home, how does Shayla make you feel loved? What does she do that makes you feel loved? 

00:28:40
TERRY She's a great[00:2845] mom, she's a great, great mom. Phenomenal caretaker for our son. 

00:28:50
MAKUNGU AKINYELA And that really helps Micah. 

00:28:50
TERRY Absolutely. 

00:28:50
MAKUNGU AKINYELA What does Shayla do to make you feel loved? 

00:28:55
TERRY That's part of it, that there's no one else that I would trust Micah with the way I trust him with Shayla. 

00:29:05
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So for you, the kind of work that she does to care for your son makes it feel to you that your wife loves you? 

00:29:15
TERRY Absolutely. 

00:29:15
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So that's one of the ways that you feel loved. So I'm wondering if what you're saying is, "Okay, since her service in our household makes me feel loved, maybe my service in our household should make her feel loved." 

00:29:30
TERRY Well, not so much in the household. Mine is in the workplace. 

00:29:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA In the workplace. But its- 

00:29:35
TERRY (crosstalk)Exactly, it's the same kind of idea, absolutely. 

00:29:40
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)That's what helps you to feel loved? If you could hear Shayla say that that's nice, but that's not the things that make her feel loved, would you be willing to listen? 

00:29:55
TERRY I'd like to say yes. 

00:29:55
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Can we say yes for right now? 

00:29:55
TERRY Well, here's the thing. 

00:29:55
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Just a pin on it. 

00:30:00
TERRY We can absolutely say yes, but I'd like to add a pin to that. 

00:30:00
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay 

00:30:00
TERRY I'll say yes, I want to hear everything Shayla has to say, if she can say it without yelling. 

00:30:05
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay. That sounds good. So what's hard for you is when it feels like it gets to yelling, but you could listen if you could hear that maybe Shayla has another way to feel loved? 

00:30:20
TERRY Yes. 

00:30:20
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay, okay, okay. Y'all have a really heavy life, I can really hear that, I can't imagine what it would be like to have to care for a five year old 24 hours a day, like you're saying, and the amazing thing is you have a good quality of life, because the hard work that you're doing that's making it financially possible to do this, and because of the hard work that you're doing to make that home a place that's comfortable. Y'all are working really great- 

00:31:05
SHAYLA (crosstalk)Right, and I mean, Terry's funny to me, because I run baths for him, I gave him foot massages, I try to leave him notes in his briefcase. I do things that are specifically from me to him. From his woman to my man, and when I try to tell him that's what I need, he sound just being romantic, I look at too many romantic movies. 

00:31:25
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Can I flip a question for you? Though, I bet you if you got those foot rubs and that bath run for you, you would love that, wouldn't you? 

00:31:35
SHAYLA I would. 

00:31:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA You would love that wouldn't you? You would, you would. But, the question that I asked Terry, you know, I bet you he acts like he just takes that for granted, doesn't he? 

00:31:45
SHAYLA Evidently, because when you asked him what do I do for him to make him feel loved, that didn't even come into his mind. I mean, but that's how he is at work, he's very task oriented and delegate and so if people get their job done, then they win favor in his eyes. 

00:32:05
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So, Shayla, do you think it's possible that you also answering the question the same way that Terry is, that you're giving Terry all that stuff that makes you feel good, the gift that's good to you. 

00:32:15
SHAYLA (crosstalk)Yes, because I believe that you're supposed to do unto others as you want them to do unto you, and just like he said, I know that Terry likes stuff in place, he wants function before fashion, I get that, so I make sure the house runs efficiently. 

00:32:30
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Which is the stuff he really appreciates. 

00:32:30
SHAYLA That's what he likes. 

00:32:30
MAKUNGU AKINYELA He doesn't appreciate the foot rubs? 

00:32:35
SHAYLA He doesn't, so I'm trying to tell him my love language he don't even want to hear, he just want to say, look, I don't cheat, I don't beat you, I'm here, so be quiet, what are you complaining about? And I don't like the fact that you want to say it's complaining when I'm trying to just be honest. I'm trying to be open. 

00:32:50
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Let me ask this, okay? 

00:32:55
SHAYLA What're you [inaudible] and stuff for? 

00:32:57
TERRY You see, you see that? 

00:33:00
MAKUNGU AKINYELA I do. 

00:33:00
TERRY You see? I'm just sitting here, and I'm listening to her, and she's right, those are the things I say, but they're so true. 

00:33:05
SHAYLA But do you see he's not listening, I am blowing it, rubbing his head and carrying on like I'm just getting on his nerves. 

00:33:10
TERRY No, because we're all having an adult responsible conversation. Doc and I are at a four, you're jumping to a nine. 

00:33:20
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Don't put me on your team, now. 

00:33:20
TERRY Okay, okay. 

00:33:20
MAKUNGU AKINYELA I'm not on your team yet. 

00:33:20
TERRY But here's the thing, here's the thing, Doc; you haven't raised your voice once. To her, to me, or just in general, and I'm just saying, Shayla, everything doesn't have to be a yelling match. 

00:33:30
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Is this, this happens in house? Time out. 

00:33:35
TERRY See who's going? Now, see who's going? 

00:33:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Time out. Hold up, let me ask you a question. When I first asked y'all, when I first asked y'all why you were here, it sounded like you had a hard time putting it together, but I'm kind of getting a story now, and it sounds like that y'all work, as far as your household, parenting, you both love your son, you both work really hard to bring this household together, it's just that when it comes to having a conversation with each other, you're really missing it, and you're really missing it, but I'm going to ask, you called me last week to make this appointment, right? And it seems like, you know, this is kind of, you've been kind of telling me, this is the general story of why things don't feel right in the house, but it seems like something is really happened that really kind of has you at this place right now, sitting here, and again, the good thing is, think about this, I'm really happy, because you're sitting here, because you could be sitting in a lawyer's office, right? [00:3445] Yeah, so it gives me alot of hope that you're actually here. It tells me that you're both have a desire to fight for your marriage. That- 

00:35:00
TERRY We don't want to be sitting in no lawyer's office. 

00:35:00
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Exactly, and that gives me, that tells me wow, we can do something, we can work with this. Just before you called me, and Shayla, I know you made the call, but again, you're both here, you're both here. What happened to you, what happened? 

00:35:20
Healing Question #1 What happened to you? 

00:35:25
SHAYLA Well, Dr. A, we hadn't been on a vacation in I don't know how long, so Terry agreed that he was going to take some time off work so that we could go on vacation, and I planned a cruise trip to the Bahamas. We get on the trip, and all Terry wants to do is eat and sleep in the cabin. I had planned excursions, swimming with the dolphins, we were going to be in the boat with the clear bottoms we can see all the animals and stuff, then we can go on a tour of the island. He didn't want to do any of those things. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. He just said I should be happy that we're going, my girlfriends don't get to go on a cruise, I don't know why, he's more worried what my girlfriends do that I am. 

00:36:30
MAKUNGU AKINYELA And when you went on that cruise, what happened? 

00:36:35
SHAYLA It was supposed to be a time for he and I to reconnect. We don't even look at each other anymore. When we talk to each other, we don't even look at each other. So it was supposed to be a time for us to look at each other and see each other, and we spent most of the cruise doing separate things, and he doesn't see how that's a problem. 

00:37:05
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Did you want to do things with your wife? 

00:37:10
TERRY Absolutely, Doc. 

00:37:10
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Can you say what kept you from doing things with her? 

00:37:20
TERRY As Shayla said, you know, we hadn't been on vacation for a while, a long time, and it's very taxing, caring for our son, so I was working, she's right, picked up alot of hours, you know, to make this trip happen, so by the time the vacation came, I was tired, and I understand she had these excursions planned, and that's great, but my time with my wife, I was hoping to just spend that time with my wife, just me and my wife, not on a cruise, not on some excursion, not going here to this place or to that place, we could just lay around and veg out and do nothing. I didn't want to come back from my vacation having worked harder and being more tired than when we left. We've done that before. The whole idea is to go relax, chill, be easy, and just enjoy one another, not go to this place and that place, running to and fro, hither and yon, and she says I see that as a problem. It's not that I see that as a problem, it's like, sweetie, I'm tired, can't we just hang out with each other? 

00:38:30
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Did you say that to her? 

00:38:30
TERRY I thought so, but- 

00:38:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)Hold on, did you, can you remember saying 

00:38:35
TERRY I don't know if I said it in those words, the way I'm saying it to you right here, but I'm just saying I know along the, when we got there, she was saying, "Why do you want to stay in the cabin, why," I said, "Sweetie, because I'm tired, why don't you come lay down with me?" She's like no, I want to do this, I want to do that, I've got this planned, I've got that planned, so everything was a No. When all I wanted to do was veg out. Okay, if it wasn't in the cabin, we could lay by the pool, if we didn't lay by the pool, we could lay on the deck. Just relax and take it easy, that's all I wanted to do. 

00:39:05
SHAYLA (crosstalk)We should have went to a cabin on the lake, then. If he was just wanting to sleep- 

00:39:10
TERRY (crosstalk)But she didn't want to go to a cabin, she wanted to go on a cruise. 

00:39:15
MAKUNGU AKINYELA She wanted to go on a cruise. 

00:39:15
TERRY And we could do the same thing, but we'd be together, I wanted to do the things she wanted to do, but I also wanted to be able to rest and recuperate. 

00:39:25
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So, you make this great plans for this cruise, you're excited about going on this cruise to the Bahamas. You found a way to make sure that Micah was safe, and that he would be taken care of for these few days, you really pumped up about this cruise, you're on this ship, and then everything just seems to fall apart. You just, it sounds like just like at home, you're on this page, you're on this page, and you're both reading in opposite directions. 

00:40:00
SHAYLA Yes. 

00:40:05
TERRY Feels like we're not even in the same book. 

00:40:05
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Not even the same book, right, and it sounds like the cruise then causes more problems than you had before you started. So, with all that, and it sounds like this kind of like, just made things worse for you, you know. Shayla, you're like, really hurt now, and you're feeling like your husband doesn't love you, and you're feeling like your wife doesn't understand you and doesn't appreciate the hard work that you do, and how that hard work makes you tired. How is all that that happened on that cruise, which seemed to make life worse, even though you hoped it would make life better, how is that affecting your marriage today? 

00:40:50
Healing Question #2 How is what happened affecting you now? 

00:40:55
SHAYLA Doesn't even feel like a marriage, it feels like we're roommates. I can't even think of the last time he touched me. 

00:41:05
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So, you're not being intimate? 

00:41:10
TERRY It's not like I don't want to, Doc. 

00:41:15
MAKUNGU AKINYELA It's not like you don't want to? 

00:41:15
TERRY It's not like I don't want to, but at every turn, I go to reach and she's jumping back, and I'm trying to figure out why. That's not inviting, you know, if the way I'm touching her, or something that I'm just not aware of, that's one thing, then tell me, but it's almost like she doesn't want me to touch her. 

00:41:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So, it's pushed you further apart, how are you feeling, if you were to name the biggest emotion that's walking around you right now, Shayla, what is it? 

00:41:50
SHAYLA I just feel hurt and lonely. 

00:41:50
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)You feel hurt, ok, you feel hurt and lonely. Terry, what's the biggest emotion that's walking around you right now? 

00:42:05
TERRY It's frustration, the emotion, Doc. 

00:42:10
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Ok, you're feeling frustrated. So, frustration is- 

00:42:15
TERRY (crosstalk)I'm a fixer, I'm a fixer, that's what I do, Doc. 

00:42:15
MAKUNGU AKINYELA And you can't fix this. 

00:42:15
TERRY And I don't know, everything. 

00:42:15
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)You are totally incompetent 

00:42:20
TERRY It seems like it just blows up, it makes it worse, no matter how hard I try, it doesn't fix it, so then- 

00:42:25
MAKUNGU AKINYELA You're not used to being incompetent. 

00:42:25
TERRY At all. And it's frustrating, because it's like I hear my wife, I think I give her what she asks for, and then suddenly it's either not enough, or it's the wrong thing, or it's the wrong way, or it's the wrong time, or, I'm always wrong. 

00:42:40
MAKUNGU AKINYELA I heard you say that Shayla has friends, you have friends, yeah? 

00:42:45
SHAYLA I've got alot of friends. 

00:42:45
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Does he have friends? 

00:42:45
SHAYLA Not as many, just maybe two or three. 

00:42:50
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)Two or three? 

00:42:50
SHAYLA Good friends. 

00:42:50
TERRY That's it. That's all you need. 

00:42:55
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Is all this stuff that's happening at home impacting your relationships with friends at all? 

00:43:05
TERRY Well, I can say for my friends it has. I don't know that our relationship has impacted them, it's just I don't get a chance to play golf with them as much. 

00:43:15
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay, so you find- 

00:43:15
TERRY (crosstalk)I spend less and less time with them. 

00:43:15
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)You're spending less and less time even with your friends? 

00:43:20
TERRY Right, but I'm spending more time working, but they don't complain, it's not an argument between us, they just realize I'm on the grind, and they respect that, hey do what you gotta do for your wife, for your woman. 

00:43:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)Do you miss that time with them? 

00:43:35
TERRY I do. 

00:43:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA But they're supportive of you and your marriage? 

00:43:40
TERRY But they get that it's for a good reason. I don't know if this is the right term, but hopefully you understand what I mean, it's for the greater good. My friends understand your wife comes before us. And so we don't have a problem with that, hey, whenever you guys get that smoothed out, hey, you can come back, we can just catch up and play golf, then. 

00:44:00
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So, you have relationships with guys who are supportive of you and your marriage? 

00:44:05
TERRY I think so, yes. Absolutely. 

00:44:05
MAKUNGU AKINYELA You and your friends, how is this affecting you? 

00:44:10
SHAYLA Well, most of my girlfriends, I don't know, I guess they think like Terry. You have the man that works hard every day, you don't have to worry about anything financially. They kind of feel like, what are you complaining about, too? And then alot of times they don't know anything is wrong, because around my girlfriends, put on your happy face, you know, it's time to live, laugh, love, keep it moving. 

00:44:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA How about family? How are your relationships, with all this stuff going on, how are your relationships with your family folk? Your family, your family? 

00:44:50
SHAYLA My family, they kind of stay out of it, my mom, she doesn't get too involved unless she sees this really taking a toll on me, so I guess the last time I went home she really saw that I was starting to get depressed, and so that's when she was saying that I really need to try to talk to somebody. 

00:45:10
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So, so you're feeling supported from your family in a good way? 

00:45:15
SHAYLA Yes. For the most part. 

00:45:15
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)Yes. How about your family? 

00:45:25
TERRY My family's cool, they love Shay. 

00:45:25
MAKUNGU AKINYELA They love Shayla? 

00:45:25
TERRY Absolutely, so I mean- 

00:45:30
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)Are those relationships getting impacted in any kind of way by- 

00:45:30
SHAYLA His momma don't love me. She say I fuss too much. She don't like the way I keep the house, and that's where he gets that "I yell" from. 

00:45:40
TERRY (crosstalk)I don't get- 

00:45:40
SHAYLA (crosstalk)I guess his momma talks like this all the time. 

00:45:45
TERRY See, see, see how she subtly, the subtle insults? 

00:45:45
SHAYLA That ain't subtle, I'm serious. 

00:45:45
TERRY But you see, you hear that, Doc, how she undercuts my mom, the woman that brought me into this world. 

00:45:55
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So you must feel real caught in between. You got this woman you love, and I know you, as a brother I know you love your mom. 

00:46:00
TERRY Absolutely, absolutely, but look- 

00:46:00
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)So you must feel real caught right now. 

00:46:05
TERRY No, no, here's the thing, here's the thing; how she's describing it is not how it is. My mom loves her. Here's the thing, as long as the house is kept how I like it, my momma ain't married to her, so I ain't worried about anything my momma might say, so that's not a problem. 

00:46:20
SHAYLA (crosstalk)You mean to tell me that when your momma came over there last weekend, she didn't go in the bathroom after I had cleaned the whole house, top to bottom, and start cleaning it, talking about it doesn't smell like bleach. 

00:46:30
TERRY (crosstalk)And? And? That doesn't mean she doesn't like you! 

00:46:35
SHAYLA (crosstalk)That doesn't mean she doesn't like the way I, I didn't say she didn't like me, I said she said I don't know how to clean the house, and I fuss all the time. That's what I said. 

00:46:40
TERRY (crosstalk)Right, because you do, everybody says you fuss all the time Shayla. 

00:46:45
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)So, Terry, as I said before, you must feel real caught in between. 

00:46:50
SHAYLA (crosstalk)No, he ain't caught between, he's a momma's boy. 

00:46:50
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)You've got this woman you love- 

00:46:55
TERRY (crosstalk)You see that? You see that? About appreciation by insulting? Here's the thing, if I don't agree with her, I'm wrong. 

00:47:00
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay. 

00:47:00
TERRY So remember earlier I said, hey, your girlfriends don't complain or they're always complaining about their guys, and their date, or who they're married to, you don't have those problems. She says that I'm more worried about her girlfriends than her. All I'm using is an example, and saying look at all the women around you who are so unhappy with, they wish they had the things that you have, and you're complaining about it. 

00:47:20
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Can I say, but that doesn't seem like that argument is working, does it? 

00:47:25
TERRY But here's the thing- 

00:47:25
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)Hold up, is it working? 

00:47:30
TERRY It's not that it's working, but she doesn't see it. Here's the thing, I'm saying to her, my mom loves you, because she may mention the fact that you yell, or that you might not always, you know, dust in every corner, doesn't mean she doesn't like you. Those are two different things, Doc. My mom loves her. 

00:47:45
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So, as I'm understanding, you know, you're both being strongly emotionally impacted by this stuff that's going on. You're feeling this sadness, you're feeling this frustration. Obviously this is really impacting you, in terms of your relationship, your intimacy, your sense of feeling good around the house. You're being drawn away from your friends, your friends outside, even though you feel supported by them in your marriage. You're having a, you have a good relationship with your friends. There's some, sounds like there some tension kind of with around family stuff, okay. So, all this, so this thing, this cruise, which kind of sounds symbolic of what's been going on for a while, it's really impacting a whole lot of stuff around you. Y'all go to church? Y'all have church friends? 

00:48:45
SHAYLA Yes, we don't go to church together as much as we used to. 

00:48:45
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay, so you're not going to church together, because? 

00:48:50
TERRY Because I'm always picking up, I'm working alot of overtime. 

00:48:55
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Cause you're working alot of overtime. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but that's something that you used to do and enjoy together? But this work, would you want him to cut those hours? 

00:49:10
SHAYLA Yeah. 

00:49:10
MAKUNGU AKINYELA You would, even though it might mean, it sounds like those hours have really made it possible for that care to happen, so it sounds like you'd have to solve the problem 

00:49:20
SHAYLA (crosstalk)But what good is it if we lose the relationship? That's what I keep trying to tell Terry. You'll have all of this luxury, security, but we won't even be friends anymore, and we used to be best friends. 

00:49:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA You'd have to work on that. 

00:49:35
SHAYLA I'm sorry. 

00:49:40
MAKUNGU AKINYELA It's, it's ok. 

00:49:40
MAKUNGU AKINYELA It's just we used to be best friends and we used to talk all the time, and we can't even talk now. Every time we start talking it turns into an argument, and he say I'm the one that's arguing, and can't nobody argue by theyself, I don't care who you are. 

00:49:55
MAKUNGU AKINYELA As we talk about, let me ask you this; this sounds, and I can hear, it sounds really painful. We're looking at this vacation that happened that was just a disaster, we're looking at all this impact that it's having on your life right now in terms of where you are emotionally, your relationships with family, with friends, but again, I'll get back to that thing, you're sitting here right now, you're not at a lawyer's office. What's given you the strength to carry on? Where you finding your strength from? 

00:50:30
Healing Question #3 

00:50:30
In spite of what has happened to you, what gives you strength to carry on? 

00:50:30
TERRY Oh, I can answer that easily, Doc. Because I love her. 

00:50:35
SHAYLA I love him. 

00:50:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (Crosstalk)You love her? You love him? 

00:50:35
TERRY I love her, there's nobody else I want to be with, I've never thought about another. 

00:50:40
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)Wow, wow. So when you're feeling that deep frustration, and you're feeling that she's yelling at you when all this feeling misunderstood comes out- 

00:50:55
TERRY (crosstalk)Unappreciated. 

00:50:55
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Unappreciated. What does love do that says, Terry, hold on? What thoughts come to you and has you hold on? 

00:51:05
TERRY I made a promise to her. I made a promise to her, I made a promise to her family, I made a promise to myself, and I take that, those vows very seriously. Til death do us part. 

00:51:15
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So that's really helping you hold on, this commitment that you feel to not only to your wife, who you love, but also your sense of commitment to your community. 

00:51:25
TERRY Absolutely, and to myself. 

00:51:30
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)And to yourself. 

00:51:30
TERRY (crosstalk)This is the woman I chose, that I asked to marry me. 

00:51:30
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Yeah, yeah. 

00:51:30
TERRY And I don't take that responsibility and that choice lightly. 

00:51:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)Wow, that's an honorable thing. Shayla what, you said also that you love him, and I even saw a smile come up, you love him. So, tell me when all this frustration, all this disaster, all this seemingly broken relationships in so many areas come up, what does love say to you or do for you that helps you hold on? How, what does that mean? 

00:52:05
SHAYLA Because I just hope that if my back is against the wall or anything should happen, Terry's gonna figure out how to get us out, how to get us home, and Micah looks just like him. Every time I look in his eyes I see Terry, and I know that everything he does is to make sure that we're okay, I know that. 

00:52:30
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So, even though Terry kind of hears this complaining, and this, sounds like you have alot of confidence in your husband. 

00:52:40
SHAYLA I do, I trust his decisions impeccably. If Terry said this is what we're gonna do, and this is what's going to happen, it is what it is, I take that to the bank. 

00:52:50
MAKUNGU AKINYELA I hear from you alot of respect from both of you for each other. You know, I'm even though I'm hearing this pain that you have, I'm hearing that you both respect and admire each other, and you're both able to say what's good in your partner. 

00:53:10
TERRY Absolutely. She's brilliant, brilliant. [inaudible] Brilliant. 

00:53:20
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Wow, I wonder how we could grow that, I wonder how we could make more of that happen between the two of you. I have one more question to ask, as we're kind of coming to a close here, and I want to say it a couple of different ways, but I want you to looking at what happened to you, this disaster of a cruise, looking at how this disaster of a cruise has just totally messed up your life right now, it's got you like- 

00:53:55
TERRY (crosstalk)Sitting in here. 

00:53:55
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Sitting in here, right? Looking at, but then also looking at the fact that, wow, you love each other so much that it's made you able to hold on, even against the disaster, okay? What do you need to heal? If you could wake up tomorrow morning and everything in your relationship were perfect, what would be the conditions that made that perfection? 

00:54:20
Healing Question #4 

00:54:20
What do you need to heal? What does healing look like? 

00:54:25
SHAYLA Wow. 

00:54:25
TERRY Good question, Doc. 

00:54:30
SHAYLA I think, if we could have, I would like to have a date night. I mean once a week would be great, but I'd settle for twice a month, because I know he works hard, but, Doc, I need to be romanced, I need music, candles, and dancing every once in a while. 

00:54:50
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Not all the time? 

00:54:50
SHAYLA Every once in a while, not all the time. 

00:54:55
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)Every once in a while. Every now and then. 

00:54:55
SHAYLA Yeah, well, no, I need it often. Not all the time, but often. 

00:55:00
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Often? Okay, okay. 

00:55:00
SHAYLA Because I have been without for a very long time. 

00:55:05
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay, okay, okay. 

00:55:05
TERRY See how she has to change that? She said I'd settle for once a week, then twice a month, and then you say every once in a while, and she goes no, often! 

00:55:15
MAKUNGU AKINYELA But Terry, you know what? You seem like the man that could pull it off, if you put your mind to it. 

00:55:20
SHAYLA And he would enjoy it. That's the point I'm tripping about. 

00:55:25
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So, so, that, if you woke up tomorrow morning, that would feel like healing to you? 

00:55:30
SHAYLA Yes. 

00:55:30
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay, anything else for you would feel like healing? Okay, a little romance, a date night, now that seems pretty simple. 

00:55:40
SHAYLA And I'd like us to pray together, again. We used to pray together all the time. That was the daily in our household, and we don't do that anymore. 

00:55:50
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So a date night, to pray together. Those seem like pretty, wow, that would feel like healing to you? 

00:56:00
SHAYLA Yes. 

00:56:00
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Those are pretty, so Terry, what would you need to heal? What would feel like healing if tomorrow morning, if everything was good, what would feel like healing to you? 

00:56:15
TERRY I have my friend back, and my best friend back. 

00:56:20
MAKUNGU AKINYELA And if you had your best friend back, what would that look like? Describe it to me, you wake up in the morning, what would be going on? 

00:56:30
TERRY We wake up in the morning laughing. We wake up in the morning laughing. 

00:56:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay, just. 

00:56:35
TERRY For not reason, for no reason, but- 

00:56:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)No reason. 

00:56:40
TERRY We look at each other and just start laughing because we're so happy to just be there, it's not a miserable place, it's not a frustrating place, it's just happy to just take a walk, take a walk and hold hands. 

00:56:50
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So you'd like to be able to take a walk every now and then. 

00:56:55
TERRY Absolutely. 

00:56:55
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Can we combine that walk with the date night? 

00:57:00
TERRY We can do that. We can do that. 

00:57:00
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay. Alright, alright. 

00:57:05
TERRY We can do that, but just, we used to be able to be together without it being, without it being an appointment, without it feeling like a, you know, we've got to put it on the schedule, and we've got to go from here to there, and it's gotta be this way, we could just, if we said we're gonna go out tonight, but we decided, hey, you know, our favorite movie's on, we'll take off the clothes, you know, she'll grab the ice cream, I'll grab the chocolate syrup, kick our feet up and that was ok, that because plans changed it wasn't the end of the world. We could just, we could just be, we could just enjoy whatever it is, and I know she doesn't necessarily like the game, she doesn't like sports, but she at least will sit and watch when the game will be on, you know, and she'll be like, "Okay, is that a touchdown or is that a three pointer?" You know? She doesn't know, but at least she was willing to be there. 

00:58:00
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)So, let me ask this, could one of those date nights be watching a football game? 

00:58:05
SHAYLA Yes. 

00:58:05
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay, so that would work, okay, so waking up laughing, what else would, what would your relationship with your son look like if there was healing, would there be anything different there? 

00:58:25
TERRY If he could see his parents truly expressing unconditional love and what that looks like. You know what, Doc, I just realized, I had a high moment. I have absolutely no doubt that Shayla loves Micah, and I don't think that she doubts my love for him as well, we express unconditional love to Micah and we accept him exactly where he is, and I think that somehow, somewhere in these last couple of years, that's where this disconnect came, stopped accepting each other for all of us, for all those idiosyncrasies, as well as the great benefits as well, for who we are, where we are, and who we are, and somehow that, that's where the disconnect came from, so for him to see us at that place would be, I think, phenomenal. 

00:59:20
SHAYLA And then Terry, because of how much he's been working, he's not as present taking care of Micah. 

00:59:25
What does healing look like? 

00:59:25
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So if there was was healing, what would it look like, then? 

00:59:30
SHAYLA We would do more things with Micah together. 

00:59:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Together? Even praying together? 

00:59:35
SHAYLA Yes. 

00:59:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay, maybe, does he like football yet? 

00:59:40
SHAYLA (crosstalk)And just some of his routines have changed, I mean, his bath routine is changing, getting him in and out of the car is just a different process, now, and I don't think Terry is as aware of that. 

00:59:50
MAKUNGU AKINYELA So you would feel both that you're working as a team in parenting, even though it sounds like you work as a team already, but it's in, you're playing in different areas. You're doing this really great work, making sure your family is financially secure, but it's really pulling you away from a relationship with your wife, and it sounds like even with your son, you're doing really great work making sure your son is developing and growing in the best way that he can and making sure that you're home, but you're feeling displaced with a relationship with your husband, and that's creating alot of stress, so if you were able somehow to negotiate together, to carve out some time just for the two of you, a date night, and it sounds like you both agree that would be something, at least, desirable, even if it were watching a football game. Some prayer time together, and I imagine, Shayla, for you just feeling more spiritually connected is important. 

01:00:55
SHAYLA Yes. 

01:00:55
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Is that also important for you, Terry? 

01:01:00
TERRY Absolutely, absolutely, I agree, I do miss our prayer time together, that's one of the things I liked, that's one of the things I liked, I actually fell in love with Shayla about is that she, we share the same faith, and we readily share that and show it, I do miss that. 

01:01:20
MAKUNGU AKINYELA I know when y'all came in here, you know, it feels really stressful, really painful what's happening, what you've gone through, but looking at this picture that you've painted of what you're healing will look like, do you think that we could use these things that you've talked about in these last few minutes as goals, as places to try to move your relationship to, it sounds like you both agree that this is a good place to get to, if that could be your story, if that could be your testimony, right, that hey, we are a couple, we've gone through some hard times, we've got a son that we've had to struggle for, because we love him so much, and we've even had some struggles in our marriage, through no fault of our own, but because we kind of lost our friendship for a while, but today we've got, we were able to spend time together, and we pray together, and we're able to make sure that our son is developing the best that he can. Would that be a place that you'd want to shoot for? 

01:02:25
SHAYLA Yes. 

01:02:25
TERRY Absolutely 

01:02:25
MAKUNGU AKINYELA (crosstalk)Do you feel like it's possible to do that, now we've got a picture of where we'd like to be, now we ain't there yet, but would it be possible to make an effort to move towards there? 

01:02:35
TERRY Absolutely. 

01:02:35
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay, we just have to kind of see the things that are blocking it and get there. Does that make sense? 

01:02:45
TERRY Yeah. 

01:02:45
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay, well, would you like to make another appointment? 

01:02:50
SHAYLA You gonna make another, I got to drag you again. 

01:02:55
TERRY No, no, no. 

01:02:55
SHAYLA Cause you want to come? 

01:02:55
TERRY Yeah, yeah. 

01:03:00
MAKUNGU AKINYELA Okay, I think it was good. Alright, so we'll make another appointment and we'll start building on that. Okay? 

01:03:05
TERRY Absolutely, thanks, Doc.
