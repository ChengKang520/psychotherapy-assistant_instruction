RICH SIMON Welcome, everyone. My name's Rich Simon. I am editor of "Psychotherapy Networker" and welcome to this webcast series "Neuroscience in Action: How the Brain Matters." So, I think we are all aware that there has been a, really a revolution in our understanding of how the brain works and more recently some of the connections between how the brain functions and what goes on in psychotherapy. It's an area that has created, it's gotten as much conversation going as anything else that's happened in this field over the last 10 years. So, we're going to be talking with some of the innovators and people who have really been responsible for putting brain science on the, on the radar of psychotherapists. And today we are very lucky to have with us the author of "How the Brain Changes Itself", Norman Doidge. Norman, how are you? 

00:01:05
NORMAN DOIDGE Fine, thanks. "The Brain That Changes Itself". 

00:01:10
RICH SIMON "The Brain That Changes Itself". So, it's, it's always good to get to the title of the author's book correct when we start the interview. So, uh, Norman just, so you have as much as, as anyone really helped unpack this notion and explicate this notion of neurolasticity for psychotherapists. Just start us off here. What is it that, how did you get interested in the brain in the first place? 

00:01:35
NORMAN DOIDGE Well, I actually was interested in the brain as a, as a kid. My mother was a psychologist. But, uh, I got interested in it when I first started being interested in psychotherapy at roughly the same time. I studied, uh, as an undergrad I studied philosophy. And I also studied Freud's very very early writings. So you'll remember that Freud was a neuroscientist before he became a neurologist. And, in that first volume of Freud, he puts together eight, a model of how the brain works for psychologists, and he's trying to integrate the two. And, I was intrigued by that because I knew from the work by an author named Peter Amater(ph) that Freud's neurological education very much was the underpinning for what we now call his meta-psychology, you know, his, his psychological principles, uh, were derived from what he learned as both a neurologist and neuroscientist. I wanted to understand these things in depth. So, I began studying at that point. And Freud was a very great integrative thinker in this respect. And, you know, for instance the notion that neurons that fire together are wired together, uh, which has to do with how timing affects how we form neuronal connections actually derived from Freud in that very first volume of his standard edition. Uh, you can find references to something he calls the law of associative, and in that he basically argued that when, uh, a mental event occurs that has two components, say you see a man with the yellow hat and he's tall and thin, you've got neurons firing for thinness and others firing for yellow at the same time. And so they are associated because they fire simultaneously. So this, this core neuroplastic notion can be traced all the way back to Freud. Most people think it begins with Donald Hebb. 

00:03:45
RICH SIMON Yeah, sure. 

00:03:45
NORMAN DOIDGE In the midcentury, uh, but actually it came out of Freud. And Eric Kandel, who won the Nobel prize for demonstrating plastic change in a very very compelling way, also basically was turned on to these kinds of investigations by his interest in Freud. You know, he grew up in Vienna, and he wanted to become a psycho analyst and psychologist when he came to the United States. And Mortimer Austowell(ph), who is a teacher of his, said you know, "Eric, you have this incredible gift to do experimental science. Psychotherapy seems to take place from some kind of learning, but we don't know how that occurs." And so, Kandel, who was very again interested in Freud, uh, started to begin to study snails to, to really solve that problem. I mean, neuroplasticity, that wonderful piece of neural plastic research which was not accidental, unlike most of the great neural plastic discoveries I think which were, grew out of a wish to integrate and understand how psychotherapy works. Now, I was also a philosophy student, and I was not satisfied with the mainstream scientific idea that nature is this vast mechanism, and the organs inside our bodies have to be understand, understood mechanically. Uh, I knew that that view was based on a view of nature which arose around the time of Galileo, which saw that the entire universe is this a big clock, clockwork universe. You know, Galileo was able to explain the movement of the planets mechanistically according to the laws of physics. And the scientists were so impressed by what he did that they started to explain the organs in our body mechanistically. And, William Harvey showed that the heart was like a pump and there was, that of course seems like a machine. And Descartes shortly after that said, "Well, I think the brain works like a kind of pumping machine." And I won't go into that model that he had, but it was very pump like. So, it got to, this is a really really important philosophical point. It got to the point that scientists and educated peoples thought that for an explanation to be scientific it had to be mechanistic. And people were describing us in a very determined way. And I was just profoundly, uh, troubled by that view because it didn't do very well in distinguishing our animate and inanimate. We are animate, and these machines are inanimate. And there were traces of that in all major psychological movements and still are. I mean, saw things very deterministically as though we are like machines. And, even Freud had defense mechanisms, although to his credit he was arguing that it was the unconscious portions of our thought seemed more determined and mechanistic, uh, for sure, and the defense mechanisms were unconscious. But, that Freudian movement was really a movement away from this mechanized view. So that was one thing. Then I went to Columbia, uh, to study psychiatry precisely because Kandel was there. His influence on the department was so profound. But, the next way I got into it in, uh, in earnest was right out of the clinical situation. And, I have an office that's right near the University of Toronto, and I had some patients I was working with who were either professors or students who were doing really good work in therapy in a very conventional way, but we're still having trouble completing their work even though they were obviously terribly bright. And, I had done enough psychotherapeutic analytic work with them to know that I'd worked some major things through and realized that they had some very subtle learning disabilities that no one detected. And they were just very unusual. And so I started to study learning disabilities. And most of the literature of the time was adamant that once you, you're born with one all you can do is learn to work around them. 

00:08:05
RICH SIMON When, when are we talking about? What, what years? 

00:08:05
NORMAN DOIDGE Well, this is the 1990s I guess, when I was doing this. And that was just the general model. At the same time something else was happening in the environment, which was, uh, it seemed to, to many people that the answer to all of our woe would be in genetics. And as genetics were making these extraordinary discoveries, people were increasingly talking in terms of kind of genetic determinism or pre-determinism, meaning that our problems are, are really much formed already by our genes. And, so I saw that there were two metaphors here that were at play. The first one was the machinelike metaphor of the brain, the brain as computer, uh, which was meant it was a machine with parts, and each part performed one cognitive function in a single location in the brain. And then genetic pre-determinism, which basically said, you know, who you are, how you are going to do is all determined. And I noted this funny thing, that patients would often, uh, not, if they didn't get better in therapy, colleagues would often say or with medication or ECT, colleagues often said, "Well, I think that this is a genetic problem." But when people with the same conditions, the same kinds of anxiety problems, depression, etc. got better, no one said anything whatsoever about genetic predeterminism. Uh, and it was just a very clear it was just a metaphor. And so, I began to put together the work of Kandel and others, and then I decided I really had to understand this in a very personal way and just start traveling to the labs where people had had neuroplastic breakthroughs. And in those days, people were often talking to each other about their breakthroughs. Most of these things were done off grant because, you know, the conventional teaching was that, you know, the brain is fixed. And most of the discoveries were accidental. So that's how I got into it. There were philosophical roots. There were clinical roots. Uh, there are theoretical roots. 

00:10:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. Yeah, so part of it is, is sort of the basic, uh, it's almost like a philosophy of science orientation, the basic metaphors that we were using, the basic ways... 

00:10:30
NORMAN DOIDGE (inaudible )Racunian(ph) revolution and paradigm shift, you know. 

00:10:35
RICH SIMON That's right. 

00:10:35
NORMAN DOIDGE The evidence is usually there before the paradigm shift occurs. It's just disqualified, and people say, "Well, the measurements couldn't have been right" or "This is just some fanciful notion." Or "The scientist is just not reliable." But all the evidence has been there. The first neuroplasticity experiment I was able to find was done, uh, in the early 1800s, uh, and guy, a person named Vincenzo Malcarne basically took birds and dogs, and he stimulated them. He was an expert in the cerebellum. He stimulated half of them. The other half he didn't stimulate, and he sacrificed the animals. And he, he, he claimed to see, uh, bigger areas, bigger lobules, if you will, kinds of areas in the brain. Uh, and this, this was discounted, but of course this has now been repeated thousands of times, mostly the change is at a microscopic level. Uh, Malacarne claimed it wasn't, uh, but people weren't ready to receive that experiment at that time. 

00:11:40
RICH SIMON So, what's, what, you are one of these people who bridges different disciplines. You are in addition to everything else a poet clearly interested, interested in the philosophy of science. You're a practicing therapist, and then you have this interest in neuroscience. So, part of the inspiration for, uh, "The Brain That Changes Itself" was, uh, tracking down these rather, these series of these remarkable stories of people who have had these setbacks and lives. They have what appear to be permanent disabilities, and, and how that, how they managed to cope with them. So what, where, where, so what's, tell us one of these stories, one of these first stories that you encountered that you talk about in your book that was particularly striking and perhaps inspiring to you. 

00:12:35
NORMAN DOIDGE I'll tell you a couple. I mean, one of them was the story of Barbara Aerosmith, who was a woman in Toronto that I got involved was because I was interested in learning disorders, and she was claiming to have, uh, been able to instead of working around the problems, to actually have, uh, literally rewired her brain. She was born with a devastating array of learning disorders herself. She was very intelligent, but there were all sorts of problems that she had. She didn't know where her body was in space. She had Brokus(ph) area kind of problem, so she sounded like someone at times who'd had a stroke. But her most devastating problem was a problem relating symbols. And so she couldn't do anything that required relating symbols. Now that shows up in, in an interesting array of problems. For instance, she couldn't understand prepositions because prepositions are about, you know, the cup is on the table. It's about a relationship. Or, uh, the middle finger is between, you know, the thumb and the pinky. That's about a relationship. She had trouble about understanding logic, and that's about relationships. And many mathematical concepts are all about relationships of course. So all of those things. 

00:13:55
RICH SIMON And, and telling, telling clock time was remarkable. 

00:14:00
NORMAN DOIDGE Yeah, exactly. She couldn't read, uh, an analog clock because she couldn't tell the relationship between the minute end of the hour hand. Anyway, she had a very traumatic childhood just through the burden of this learning disorder, uh, and being misunderstood. And, and yet there were parts of her brain that were functioning like a genius level in, in terms of memory she was just extraordinary. That was her chief compensation. Anyway, she was also an incredible observer of children. And, somehow or other by just studying for hours and hours and hours at a time. I mean, she might have to read a paragraph 20 or 30 times in a textbook, uh, she managed to get through school by her memory and extraordinary efforts. But, you know, she was suicidal in a very serious way. At some point this was so painful and devastating. Anyway, she befriended a man named Joshua Kohn(ph) at some point who was helping her with compensations. And, at some point he put her on to the writings of Luria, and again she (inaudible ) of paragraph. But, there was a case in, you know, the great Luria, Russian neuropsychologist, called a little book called "The The Man with the Shattered World". And it described a man who had, uh, and injury in, in World War II that Luria was following. And he too, couldn't understand prepositions, uh, logic, mathematics, cause-and-effect, anything to do with relations. And at that point she realized , "O my goodness, like, I'm not making all this up. I really have some kind of neurological deficit here." 

00:15:45
RICH SIMON I'm not alone. I'm not a freak, isolated freak of nature. 

00:15:50
NORMAN DOIDGE Yes, that was very clarifying. But Luria had no treatment to speak of, uh, for this poor man, Sezetski(ph). But around that time, Mark Rosenzweig, in California at the time I believe, uh, did some experiments where he took mice and rats, and he put to them in different conditions where there was some kind of stimulation, cognitive kinds of stimulation, maze work, whatever, and compared those, those animals to ones that didn't get it. Sacrificed the animals, and found that the animals that had this kind of cognitive stimulation had heavier brains, more blood supply, more neurotransmitters, and eventually they showed more synaptic connections. So this, this work came out in the 60s, and Barbara Aerosmith heard about this work, and she just had this epiphany. You know, I should be able to exercise my deficit , and since one of her most obvious problems was reading a wristwatch, she basically got pictures made of different times, and she started off very very simple, like just a minute hand, just an hour hand. And then added the minute hand. Made hundreds of these cards. And then she got her friends to flip up the card and the answer was on the back, and she had to guess it right and then went on to the next card. So she started off with just hour hands then added minutes and seconds, then added week and month and year. And she was doing this like, you know, and it was completely exhausting mentally, but she was incrementally increasing this. And then, you know, one day she was up to like five or six standard clocks, and she walked, uh, past a television set and "60 minutes" was on. And, she was never able to understand anything in real time. It was only in the lag time that she'd go over conversations over and over and over. And she... 

00:17:50
RICH SIMON Oh, my. 

00:17:50
NORMAN DOIDGE That she had just understood, I guess it was Mike Wallis and Morley Safer even back then, what they had said in real time. And that she had actually broken through this. Not only could she of course read a wristwatch at this point, but she could, you know, began to be able to understand numbers and logic and calculation. Well, I sent people to that school, and I saw them getting better, uh, doing the kinds of exercises that Barbara had developed. I mean, that's just one of many many stories, and I realize, "Oh my goodness, like, you really can rewire the brain." I also saw the incredible opposition she faced because, and I saw this over and over again that people would come in with these chronic disabilities were they had been told they would never get better, apply for disability. And there was a whole lobby to get, you know, learning problems classified as disabilities, and everybody opposed her. the scientists usually were dismissive and said, "Well, you haven't studied at the University with us. How could you do science?" At times she went to , uh, hospitals and said, "Look, please study what I do." And she gave them examples of patients that get better, come speak to them. The answer was always same. "Well, they probably didn't have a learning disorder in the first place, and they would have grown out of it or they grew out of it developmentally." Even though they'd been stuck for years. sometimes even patient organizations were saying, "You're saying we don't have a disability if it can be fixed with some, you know, brain exercises or computer games." Anyway, that's because the paradigm hadn't shifted. 

00:19:35
RICH SIMON Yeah, so the paradigm gives you blinders, the old. It's hard to make the shift and to incorporate the anomaly. Go ahead. 

00:19:45
NORMAN DOIDGE So many get better. And then I started to study different, many different kinds of learning disorders and, and work with people that had strokes, I met a woman who had half a brain. And I watched how that had reorganized itself. Uh, and, and so on and so forth. I started to realize, you know, these weren't one offs. it wasn't that the brain was sometimes plastic in some situations. I realized that the brain is always plastic, and I started to think about, well if it's always plastic, why doesn't it always show itself to be plastic? Why is it not self-evident? And, I tried to lay the groundwork so that people would understand why that's the case. I mean, you know, there are four big reasons. The first one I told you, is, uh, the paradigm was such that we said it was fixed, and so we just disqualified data to the contrary. Related to that was, uh, when people got better, we were able to say to ourselves they were never sick in the first place. For instance, with strokes date, they teach that about 100 years ago it was discovered that after a person has a stroke there is a kind of metabolic chemical derangement in the brain. Uh, there's been a lot of inflammation. Cells die. They spill their contents creating a toxic atmosphere. Dead cells have to be mopped up and so on and so forth. And it was known to last for a good, at least, you know, several weeks, often to six weeks, this crisis would occur. And so what would happen is at the end of about, people would be given little bits of rehabilitation after a stroke, but by the time six weeks had elapsed they'd stop. And the reason was they assumed this quote rehabilitation wasn't forming new connections in the brain. All it was doing was priming the pump. The brain had been, tissue died and to the rest of the brain was in shock. We waited until the shock went away, and then we primed the pump with a few movements just to see what was left. So, rehabilitation, the model for it was , you know, maybe an hour two to three times a week. That's what stroke patients would get. In fact, that's what stroke patients still get, and it's based on a completely out of date model. Rehabilitation neuroplastically is about building branded new connections in the brain or strengthening very weak connections. It's not about priming the pump and seeing what's left. It's about learning to walk , you know, using another part of your brain. And so, it's much more intensive, you know, it might be four or five hours, and it could go on very very intensively for, for two weeks, but I saw cases of people who had two years of rehabilitation who got completely better. I'm not saying that can happen in all cases at all, and in all situations. But that, so just in terms of things like psychotherapy, I realized that, well, let me put it to you this way. You know, when Freud first, I, I think the first psychotherapy in our time really was the psychotherapy of the hypnotists. And, uh, those were not, uh, extremely long-term therapies. And then analysis came along, and Freud had this sense that it should be six days a week for about six months. A full hour. You could see that, that's, there's quite a dose in their in terms of, of learning and getting acquainted with something. And then of course, it got longer and longer, etc., and now therapy's often once a week. It's about coming together and getting insight. And that will work if you presume that the patient's thinking about the sessions in between the sessions. But we see for neuroplastic change to occur, uh, for brain change to occur you've got to be very very active, uh, and so that's, that's changed my approach to psychotherapy. I understand now that the patient really has to understand, they have to be really active in between sessions. Uh, now, some people get this automatically. I think in Freud's time people got that automatically. They were very very active people, uh, and that's in part because people knew that the psychotherapy, Freud was pretty adamant, psychotherapy is six months. That's sort of all you get, and then you go off on your own. And then if you have a crisis, you might come back for a short tuneup. As the idea of psychotherapy got longer and longer, hence the patient always knew they could come back to the therapist and discuss it. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not against long-term psychotherapy. I do plenty of it. But, I'm just saying neuroplastically I now understand that it's really important that the patient understand how brain change works. And some people get it intuitively, so they have, I have many patients. We all have patients like that, you know, they get insight or they learn something new about themselves, and then they go out and try something different or think about it or write down their dream, uh, and they are really really engaged with these ideas. But some people need to be taught that. 

00:25:15
RICH SIMON So, now one of the things that you, that you've highlighted or these basic principles of, of neuroplasticity and what you were just saying seems to be, if anything, perhaps they, the overarching one of the, the amount of repeated, uh, work, the role of attention and working on something as you're describing your rehabilitation process with people who have, uh, physical disabilities. So, in terms of your as you, as you've been brought together these stories, you became a, kind of the Oliver Sacks like figure of really searching out to these, these tales that are very engrossing of people who are overcoming these difficulties. And you've put together a bunch of, of principles that really are, that kind of summarize in some ways, these, kind of the core of understanding neural plasticity. So, can you talk to us just a little bit about what's, what to those, those principles are that really, with all this, the complexity of this process really stand out for you at this point? 

00:26:25
NORMAN DOIDGE Well, there are a number of them. So, the first one is that brain, brain tissue, uh, is in some ways, in some respects, more like muscle tissue. It does need stimulation and exertion, and when it gets that, uh, it develops itself. And, the corollary of that is if you don't stimulate the brain, you, uh, that cortical real estate is taken over by other functions that are stimulating the brain. A way of summarizing this is that it's a use it or lose it brain. And, this is really really important, uh, because in all sorts of psychological issues and deficits, our brain is, our brain, not just our mind, certain brain areas I think start to go quiescent. So, the way I learned about this, there have been thousands of experiments that show if human beings don't get stimulation, things, things go awry in the brain and things atrophy. But, the most dramatic example of that, uh, for me is the work of Edward Taub, who is a psychologist who unlike most psychologists in the 60s decided to study the brain. You know, now psychologists think nothing of studying the brain, but in the heyday of behaviorism American-style, under people like Watson, you know, there was a sense, Watson had to these very contemptuous comments for people who went and tried to figure out what was happening inside of the brain. 

00:28:05
RICH SIMON The black box. We didn't peer inside the black box. 

00:28:05
NORMAN DOIDGE There was a black box. So, I mean, at the height of behaviorism, I mean, there was a kind of willful arrogance and ignorance about the brain. And that, because it was a black box is meant that mental life was not important, you know, subjective life was not important. The so-called hardware of what was going on in the brain was not to be investigated. And, Watson mocked people who thought there were little man inside the brain going around like the servants of a Vulcan and engraving certain pathways between neurons. Now, let me just say for a second what's wrong with that. Their idea was that for something to be truly scientific meant it had to be based on observation so that we could agree what's happening. But, isn't it observation based on consciousness? After all, who's doing the observation? Consciousness. And isn't consciousness tied into subjectivity? So, this derogation, I mean, this elevation of observation as though it could somehow be separated from consciousness and subjectivity is philosophically extremely naïve. Uh, I mean, when Descartes would try to found certainty on a statement like, "I think therefore I am." as opposed to say, a founding certainty on that there's a rock here and it's hard. You know, he realized that there were optical illusions and people got things wrong. So, I mean, the whole sort of epistemological basis for the enterprise was hostile to the notion of subjectivity. Okay. So, here was Edward Taub, and he wasn't that interested in subjectivity of the time. He was a pretty hard-core behaviorist, but he wanted to understand the brain. And many of his teachers discouraged him from doing, from doing that at that time. Nonetheless, he did. And he ended up, uh, working with monkeys. And, one, he was trying to establish a very deterministic observation that was made by Sir Charles Sherrington. I won't tell you how he got there, but at a certain point he was working with these animals, and he would do these experiments called de-affrontation(ph), meaning he would cut off the nerves going to the spine. And he fully expected the animals wouldn't be able to use their hands because of that. And he was trying to prove that Sherrington was right about something. Anyway, to make a long story short, it turned out that in fact the animals often could use their arms. Now, here's how it came to light. I'll just tell it to you in human terms. If you go to his stroke clinic now, here's what you find. There are people here who have lost the use of, let's say, of their left hand. And he's training them to get it back. When people can't use their left hand, they tend to want to use their right hand. What Taub would do, is he'd put that right hand in a cast or a sling so they couldn't and begin to train the left hand. 

00:31:20
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:31:20
NORMAN DOIDGE Okay. And that's because he had discovered that when a person has a stroke, Sophia have a stroke in my left hand, sorry, like if I can't use my left hand and had a right (inaudible ). What he discovered is there is this swelling that goes on for the six weeks and so on that I described earlier and occurs. And during that period, I will try to use my left hand, but it is in this chemically deranged state. And, I will stop trying. Now, this is not happening consciously simply. It is happening consciously, but it's going on a deeper level, that the feedback mechanism of the brain is basically saying left-hand doesn't work. So you stop trying to use it. You use your right more. By preventing people from using their rights and forcing them to do very baby like motions with the left hand, he could get to them to use their left hand. Now, he called this process by which the brain, being a little bit anthropomorphic here, the brain concludes or we unconsciously conclude we can't use our left-hand, learned non-use. He said, because you learn, you learn not to use it, because you tried it and it didn't work. Now, one of the experiments he did with monkeys is he cut off the, then nerves, uh, the connection between the hand and the spine and therefore the brain. And, then he put the hand that had been affected or damaged in a cast. So this is a different hand, different arm in a cast. And, then when he removed the cast six or eight weeks later, the, the animal could actually move its hand. Isn't that weird? Then, he cut off the nerves for the left hand and arm and most of the nerves for the right hand and arm, sensory nerves. Put them in casts immediately, and then after a couple of months took them out, and they could use both hands. Why was that happening? It's because they never were able to learn they couldn't use the hands. Okay so, learned non-use, I mean I still have to again pinch myself that learned non-use goes on, but it really really does go on. And, I saw that learned non-use, obviously it meant that the brain was reorganizing itself. And people who go through Taub's therapy, what they do is they can get scanned after the therapy, and Taub finds that adjacent brain areas take over from the area that was damaged in the stroke. So, it's often areas beside the damage area, but sometimes it's in the opposite hemisphere. Well then... 

00:34:15
RICH SIMON It's interesting just, just too, too kind of the psychological parallel to that. You see it in human relationships that we, we become specialists in families. Someone is the family organizer. Somebody becomes the family, someone who energizes the family that would begin to or often we mistake our personalities or essence as certain roles that we fill within the family dynamic, and there's kind of a principle of psychological non-use as we grow up it becomes who we are. Psychotherapy is having people revisit this very principle that you're talking about within the main of the brain in terms of relationships. 

00:35:00
NORMAN DOIDGE Exactly. So, I mean, here's how I got there. Uh, I then saw that there was learned non-use not only in strokes, but in people who had had radiation to their brains. I saw that learned non-use could occur with traumatic brain injuries. So these are real cases where people were trained out of learned non-use. And, I started to re-examine psychological concepts and how defense mechanisms work and realized that, you know, when a defense mechanism is occurring, it often gets you to do this thing and not that thing. And that the knowledge of that thing which you're not doing can atrophy. And if it's on a defense that's applied over a long period of development, then removing the defense will not be sufficient. I mean, I think a really good psychotherapist knows this anyway, but will not be sufficient to get the person started. Then, that circuitry, that developmental thrust needs a certain degree of encouragement. Now, once upon a time I might have thought that that was deviating from the neutrality of the therapist, uh, but now I understand that no... 

00:36:15
RICH SIMON Your psychoanalytic background, yeah, you're encouraging a certain kind of non-use of your own I suppose. 

00:36:25
NORMAN DOIDGE Yeah, well, there, actually there's, now, look, I don't want to, uh, what psychoanalysts do in their offices and, uh, what they think their books say and what Freud did our all three different things. Freud actually, remember, he, he believed that you see somebody for four to six months, and then you go out and you put it into effact. And he said specifically when a person has a phobia, it's not good enough to analyze it. Then you have to face the phobia. There is an incredible, there are incredible things you can get that by not giving patients advice and by using analytic neutrality, particularly to help them to analyze their unconscious conscience. Because if you start taking sides on every single issue, they'll never really (inaudible ). So, I'm not one of these people who say you have to throw it out. No, I think it's a spectacular leap forward. And of course, you know, all the people are understanding how Buddhism and, you know, mindfulness works. I mean, there's a real mapping together of psychoanalytic concepts of, you know, the, you know, the therapeutic neutrality and nonjudgmentalism, not necessarily as a way of life but as a way of understanding yourself. I mean, I'm not a cultural relativist in any sort, or I'm not a moral relativist in a simple term. I believe that there are certain things that are wrong, and do some things are actually evil, shocking as that may sound. But, in a therapist's office, to try to help a patient to get at aspects of themselves that they don't, uh, dare admit are there, I think therapeutic neutrality is extremely helpful. But, there are these moments when you've taken something, which has basically been subject to a kind of learned non-use, a psychological learned non-use for decades where I think you then as a therapist have to shift modes. And I do that shifting back and forth all the time. And I explained to them why I'm shifting out of the neutrality at that moment. 

00:38:25
RICH SIMON How does that sound, so as year, so, so you begin to recognize that in this domain of the brain, and you're translating it, seeing this more clearly in your therapeutic practice. So, how did this become, how did this influence the way that you work with your clients? Is there, is there an example that you, comes to mind? 

00:38:40
NORMAN DOIDGE Well, there's just many examples come to mind but, it's just like, well in some ways, it's like what a lot of the eclectic therapists do, uh, who aren't practicing therapeutic neutrality. You just go into, you know, practice 101. You explain to people that they can't expect themselves to understand these things immediately. Because, uh, I use a lot of developmental psychology here, because when someone has been, you know, inhibited, let's say in early childhood, you want to know roughly what, how, how development unfolds. And development never goes in a straight line. Psychological, you know, learning to, I don't know, have a sense of, of confidence in self involves all sorts of things of self/other boundaries, and all of these things. So, you have to be very very attuned to what developmental issue they are now working on, cuz at some level if the learned nonuse goes very far back, uh, the person's almost infantile in a way in, in, in this area. So that's where understanding child development and child psychology is very very important. But, then you have, it depends on the patient. You know, if the patient, let's say, is an athlete, someone who's just used to practicing things all the time or someone who's studied many languages, believe you me, you don't even have to have this conversation. As, as they realize they've been blocking themselves on something, the very next session they report to you all of the three things they tried, two of which failed and one of which succeeded, and they try to do it differently. But other people need, need that kind of, you know, just basic instruction there. 

00:40:30
RICH SIMON So this parallel between the, the skill acquisition and even athletic performance and personality change and psychotherapeutic change is one of the most direct implications that comes out of understanding how the brain actually learns. Would you agree with that? 

00:40:55
NORMAN DOIDGE Yeah, yeah, that's one of them. I mean, another really important thing which I can't emphasize enough is what I call the plastic paradox. So, neurons that fire together wire together. Uh, if you do something that's good for you, uh, the circuitry will fire faster, stronger, clearer signals. It will take up more of the cortical real estate because it's faster. The next time you do it, it will be the circuitry that you default to. But, if you do something that's bad for you, the same thing happens. Neuroplasticity explains, you know, bad habits, addictions, uh, patterns that we can't easily, uh, break. And I think it's really important for patients to know that, everybody to know that. Uh, the way I, I uses common metaphor that plasticity is like snow on, I say it's a common metaphor because we originally used to describe the difference between genetics and environmental influences. But, I, I put it this way along with Pascual-Leone, it's, uh, plasticity is like snow on a hill in winter. So, if you go down the mountain, go skiing down the mountain the first time. Because it's a virgin hill, you can take almost any path you want, keeping in mind that there's trees here and rocks there. But, you've got many degrees of freedom as you go down the hill. And being human, if you had a good run the first time, the next run might be very close to that. And if you keep that up, you'll develop tracks in the snow because it's plastic. And, you keep it up, they'll become ruts. And then you can't get out of it. Uh, well, the plastic paradox is that it's the same plasticity that gives rise to our flexibility in terms of our options when we choose to do something for the first time that also gives rise to rigidity. And so, rigidity can be characterological(ph) rigidity or symptomatic rigidity or response to particular triggers. And each time we respond in a particular way, we actually deepen the circuitry. So, this is something I convey to patients too, that just having the insight doesn't necessarily undo that, and that each time you do the thing that's bad for you, you know, you want to go into another relationship with, uh, someone who treats you in a way that's demeaning, you're going to deepen that pattern. I mean, I don't talk that way, but people understand that. And, you know, we are not here forever. So, uh, what do you want to be doing? Do you want to be deepening that pattern or do you want to, you know, begin to undermine that pattern? 

00:43:40
RICH SIMON Now what's, what's the flipside of that? The, the, so that is a way of certainly helping people understand their habit patterns. So what is neuroplasticity, we what has that talk you and, and more broadly the therapeutic profession about changing habit patterns? 

00:43:55
NORMAN DOIDGE Well, in, in some ways... 

00:44:00
RICH SIMON ... Practice in the importance of effort and repetition as being a really, that these magical insights that we would like to think, uh, can occur in psychotherapy and change people's lives, are fleeting and, and not to be... 

00:44:10
NORMAN DOIDGE Well, sometimes they're fleeting. Sometimes they're not. And that's where, you know, there are certain people who when they don't want to get rid of everything else they've learned or amputate another, something they learned already. I don't do that way. I'm synthetic and to some degree integrative. So, I add this to everything I already now. So right now I'm emphasizing things where there is a strong reward for particular kind of behavior. Let's say it's a bad habit or relationship habit or character defense where you can intimidate people and get off on the fact that your intimidating people to boost your self-esteem. But then, you make a lot of enemies. And then you're isolated. Something like that. 

00:44:55
RICH SIMON You pay a price. 

00:44:55
NORMAN DOIDGE In that situation it's good for them to know it. Uh, now there's different ways around it. Sometimes understanding what you're doing in terms of unconscious fantasies is really really curative and immediate. I mean, I, I think everybody who's, you know, not dogmatically opposed to the idea of the unconscious, which is of course something that's of great interest to neuroscience, knows that there's, we are almost modular. And if we have trauma we often are disassociated, and there's different parts of us. And, they don't, they're not always in agreement just as, uh, not all our brain circuitry goes in the same direction at the same time. Uh, and sometimes these, these (inaudible ) themselves allow, I would presume, your frontal lobes or your, your meta-consciousness to just have a reframe and have an immediate cure, just through the insight. Other times of course, you really have to practice these things. Sometimes you're drawn by your negative expressions of, there's no, there's neither, some people talk in terms of positive and negative plasticity. I always do that in quotes. There's just plasticity. Uh, if you like the result, you say it's positive. If you don't like the result, you say it's negative. 

00:46:15
RICH SIMON There is plasticity in context. 

00:46:15
NORMAN DOIDGE Right. It's as simple as that. Sometimes, I think it's good for people to do sort of what Taub does with his neurological patients, which is if you have a behavior that's not serving you well right now and another one that's underdeveloped and hard to do, you put a kind of a cast on the behavior and say, I'm not doing this for a while because I have to build this one up. Uh, and of course, you don't put a cast on it, but you help, and you don't tell people you're not allowed to do this, because that's not how we work. 

00:46:50
RICH SIMON How do you do it? So, what would be an example of, of, uh, as you apply that in the, with the nuance of the therapy relationship? 

00:46:55
NORMAN DOIDGE Very simply just by teaching them how their brain works. You know, I don't think I've ever recommended my book to one of my own patients, uh, except once. I lent that person a copy, and they lost it. But... 

00:47:15
RICH SIMON Freud might have predicted that, that that would actually happen, I suppose. 

00:47:20
NORMAN DOIDGE Well, another way to put it is the only time I recommended my book to somebody, well maybe once or twice, was actually once or twice I've done it, was out of desperation. If a person's had a brain injury, actually I have at times recommended my book. But, therapists frequently recommend the book. I just think it's sometimes transferentially complex. And, but here's what they find, and I'm told people find in there. They read all these stories about people with serious neurological conditions, and I have a couple of chapters in there on psychotherapy as well, and they realize, "Wow, you know, the brain really can rewire itself. Even though I'm having this particular pattern which I can't get over or belief I can't get over, I mean, people can get over having half a brain to some degree sometimes. And strokes, etc., etc." So, first of all they have to know that this is possible. They have to know a sense of the dose of about how much effort is required to do this. They have to know that you have to be paying attention while you're doing this, uh, because the, the best plastic, the quickest way to get plastic changes, not the only way, is by paying close attention. Uh, and then they, they see stories like these patients of Edward Taub, who basically could only get better when they blocked their initial impulse, which was to use the hand which was the easiest to use and had to go through for several weeks, uh, this kind of boot camp of just, you know, agonizing effort. I've seen people defeat, you know, severe anxiety disorder issues and OCD, uh, by understanding that. You say, how do I work with patients? I work, like if a patient's anxious, I do many many different things. I do core analytic work. I do, uh, some of the brain lock work sometimes, which I think in some ways is very similar to the Taub work that grew out of the work of Jeffrey Schwartz. Uh, I use hypnosis for certain things. I use EMDR for certain things. I use brain spotting for certain things. Uh, you know, I have this passage in my book where I say worry begets worry, which is an extension of neuro, you know, neurons that fire together wire together. And I've learned to watch anxious patients make themselves more anxious as they're talking. And, I'll get their permission. I don't, I don't do this, you know, like a nudnik. I will ask them if I can have their permission to start pointing out to them small subtle ways in which they ramp themselves up into more anxiety. And having explained to them this whole plastic paradox and how they could make themselves even more anxious in the course of the session, how they, by reliving all of these things and wiring them in more deeply. And then, now I have all these other psychotherapeutic techniques, you know, analytic stuff, EMDR, brain spotting and hypnosis, etc., to teach them that they can, uh, ramp themselves down. And the message is always, like, if it's an issue of hypnosis, it's, well, the hypnotist is a kind of midwife, if you will, to getting at the trance insofar as we all go in and out of trance, entranced. But, I won't just sort of play the part of the big shot hypnotist's, saying, "Look, I got you into trance." Like many people who use hypnosis, I will emphasize, uh, I'm kind of reminding you how to get into trance. You actually do it automatically very frequently. And, point out to them that they, they've done it. Their minds have done it so that they can understand their own activity in this process. And, you know, that's something I wouldn't have done before because I really want them to understand that they can drive their own plastic change in a positive direction in their own minds. So, I give them that message in many different ways. Uh, I'm not evangelical about it. I don't believe that the discovery of neural plasticity is somehow or other replaces all of our other skill sets with the importance of all of this. Uh, I, there is, you know, there's more education about how trauma wire, each time you experience the trauma you wire it more deeply into the brain, which is why we have to start intervening as soon as possible. I mean, that kind of way of getting the patient's attention. 

00:52:00
RICH SIMON So, let me ask you here. We, we just have a few minutes here . So just as we pulled back a little bit as we look ahead at where this profession is going, and, and we have shifted the paradigm in this very significant way, incorporating, we are past the age of Watson. So, it's, you know, you write in your, your book about our love affair with medication, the affair some of us have with medication. It's, it's a very blunt instrument and, and the kind of neuroplastic change that you're talking about and the kind of use of those principles can, you can move towards a more precise attempt to influence how people's brains operate and how we can change things. As you are, as you're looking ahead, if you had some thoughts here about how these notions are going to continue to develop, be applied in psychotherapy that's going to make a difference in the overall effectiveness of what we do, what stands out for you? What seems to you the applications or the principles that really will make a difference in the way in which we can really be of help to people using what you and others have discovered in the years to come. 

00:53:20
NORMAN DOIDGE Yeah, well, let me just clarify one thing about medication. I think some medications are blunt instruments and some are, are less of one. I mean they're all in some ways, the distribution of medication goes throughout the entire body and much of the brain, and so it hits lots of circuitry. In that sense it's blunt. Some of the medications do seem to be emotionally blunting. Uh, some of the medications are fabulous but they have terrible side effects. I, I feel very differently about each class of medication. Some, some are life-saving, and some are much overhyped and so on. So, I'm not against medication, but when I'm dealing, what, what I tried to say in that passage was that once you realize that talk therapy is not just talk and that it's no less a biological intervention than medication, what you realize is we are able to access relevant circuitry when we get people to talk about their various issues, that those parts of the brain that are involved in the conflicts or difficulties are being triggered as we talk about them. So, in that sense I use Susan Braun's(ph) term that psychotherapy in some respects is like microsurgery in that we're getting precisely at the circuitry we require, for people for whom psychotherapy is appropriate. There, there are people, at this point I do think bipolar disorder is something that, you know, where medication is crucial, and, uh, you know, for psychotic disorders, it's the, the issue is our medications don't, are, are good for positive symptoms, fantastic for some positive symptoms, not just good. But, they're not good for the negative symptoms, and they have terrible side effects in many cases. So, it's a problematic, it's tough call. 

00:55:05
RICH SIMON A lot of distinctions to make, yeah. 

00:55:05
NORMAN DOIDGE Yes. So okay, but look, here's how it's affected me and my practice. Along with what I learned from Barbara Aerosmith and, and many other people who work with learning problems was that on top of doing a kind of, what, formulation or psychiatric formulation what's driving the patient, I like to do a brain-based cognitive formulation to just make sure that there aren't any brain deficits or areas that, uh, my patient has. And they are far more common than you think, uh, far more common than you think. If you have one or two of these problems, usually you can just work around them, and it's not, you know, causing you great difficulty in your life. So, it's changed my approach to diagnosis. The second thing is it's allowed me to begin to understand certain forms of therapy that I didn't use before, uh, in, and begin to use them again. And one of them is hypnosis, because I think hypnosis is very very good at taking people out of atomatized behavior, I mean, be it smoking were some bad habit or way of thinking about themselves and quickly getting past that circuitry into another kind of circuitry, which they, or mental set. I realize I'm doing a mind/body blabbering here. But, it gets them out of it very quickly, and that that can be a very very good thing. So if the patient comes ten times in a row, and they are convinced that they can never get out of this, but every single session within a few minutes of hypnosis, they're out of it. Man oh man, is that an incredible learning experience for them. And then they can start to generalize. They've got to know it's possible. Then by knowing, as I've said before, by knowing what is actually possible neuroplastically, the patient and me in the countertransference, uh, we can change our attitudes of what might be possible for this patient and not be completely overwhelmed. So, it's really really important for the therapist to understand the plastic paradox. I mean, for me that was just like a crucial crucial insight. Uh, and that I want to make sure that in each of my sessions, in so far as it's possible, neither I nor the patient is making the problem worse, you know, getting the circuitry going deeper, you know, getting more and more ingrained. I think, I think that's an important thing. Now, America is, you know, loves technology and all these things, and I'm sure, uh, some people would like to speed this process up. All I can tell you is it's already pretty fast if you know, if you start to understand what's happening, uh, I think. And part of it is a re-valuation, not three if valuation... 

00:58:10
RICH SIMON Processing the incorporation of the way in which an understanding of the brain science is changing psychotherapy. 

00:58:15
NORMAN DOIDGE Well, I think if you have, I think a lot of the, if you have a lot of these conventional, cuz we didn't understand the role of plasticity, including hypnosis and brain spotting, EMDR, these things which help the person get, uh, into different states quickly. It's amazing how fast certain aspects of change can occur. I don't know if I've ever helped a patient get better, but my waiting room has. They tell me that. They say, you know, I get into your waiting room, you know, these are the ones who aren't using their blackberries in the waiting room, which I'm soon going to prohibit. But, you know, people don't have quiet time. A lot of the interest in meditation and all of this is the realization that, uh, all of these demands that people figure everything out quickly and undergo emotional growth, you know, just like that, as though we were machines and it was a matter of just moving a couple of wires around as opposed to growing into it. This is a crazy idea (inaudible ). But, that being said, I, I can report that I'm persuaded that some of these things do speed up dealing with traumatic material and anxiety disorders in particular. But, even so it takes a while. Uh, and, then the other area where I think we're going to, because Allan Schore's incredible work developmentally on the right hemisphere. I mean, it's already, is justly praised, is, you know, just groundbreaking in helping us to understand what's happening when, which is important not just if you treat children, but if you treat adults who have been traumatized in childhood. And we're starting to understand, I mean, if you just try to integrate what I'm talking about with plasticity, and Allan Schore's talking about, there has to be some kind of quote, and I put exercise in quotes, exercise of areas that have not been developed. Exercise is too much of a top-down term for it. You know, play therapy that the analysts were doing 50 years ago, I think often involved exercising brain areas that the children didn't know, uh, that were not developed properly. A lot of play therapy was done for diagnostic purposes initially to see, cuz children couldn't report dreams and fantasies. But very soon the therapists found therapeutic modes of play with the children. You know, what do you think this little girl is feeling when the other little boy dropped the car on her head? You know. And, but at other times for very early kinds of play therapy, you know, they are learning these pliagetting(ph) kind of things. At some point there's going to be, after the work of Allan Schore versions of, you know, constructing basic core psychological concepts. And I think Dan Siegel's great work is already, uh, moving in an integrative way in that way. So, like, like many people, uh, I'm very very excited by what's happening and that we are able to reappropriate things that have been around for a long time like hypnosis, and even some of the early analytic things, and understand them and understand much better what they're all about, uh, in, in brain terms. 

01:01:45
RICH SIMON And, and one of the things that's, that's said about the brain science is it really is helping us to develop a unifying language for understanding traditional methods and new ideas, and we are all basically talking about the, changing the human nervous system in a way that enables people to live a more satisfying fulfilling life. We, we are just out of time here, so I just wanted to, number one, I wanted to, uh, give people an opportunity to find out more about your work, uh, learn about where they can get "The Brain That Changes Itself". Is there a website? Or how do people? 

01:02:30
NORMAN DOIDGE Yeah, you can just go to normandoidge.com. That would be a place to go. That would be fine. 

01:02:35
RICH SIMON Okay. Okay. And, I want to invite, uh, those, those of you who have been listening to this, this conversation, to continue the conversation through our comment board. Let's hear from you. We will, this, the conversation begins between up here, but the real meaningful conversation is what continues afterward within the field. And Norman has given us an extraordinary range of vision of how, human functioning and of understanding of psychotherapy that really extends what is our vision of what's possible within our field and what psychotherapy can be. Norman, thank you so much for taking this time to be with us. I really... 

01:03:20
NORMAN DOIDGE Thank you. 

01:03:20
RICH SIMON What extraordinary work you, you've done. So, thank you so much. 

01:03:25
NORMAN DOIDGE Thanks a lot. 

01:03:25
RICH SIMON That's, that's it for this installment of this series. Look forward to seeing you again next time.
