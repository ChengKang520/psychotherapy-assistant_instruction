Supervision of a Brief Psychotherapy Case Judd Marmor, MD, PhD 

00:00:00
JUDD MARMOR Uh, the original psychoanalytic cases described by Freud were brief psychotherapeutic experiences. He, uh, treated people for, uh, half a dozen sessions. Uh, he, conducted analyses in relatively brief times. Uh, the goals and the concepts of, uh, what he was aiming at was quite different from what ultimately evolved in the history of psychoanalysis. Where, uh, as the theory became more convoluted, as the, uh, uh, metapsychology of psychoanalysis became more complex, uh, Freud really transformed what began as a therapeutic process, into a research process. And the, as a consequence of that, the, uh, psychoanalytic pro-, procedures went on for longer and longer times. Until in, in 1936, in one of his last papers, he, he spoke of analysis, terminable and interminable. And, uh, the, the question that he raised in that paper is, uh, when can we stop analysis. And, uh, is there ever an end to it, and so on. Well, uh, the emphasis over the years has changed. Uh, I might say that in the early years, even during Freud's lifetime, uh, Ferenczi, Sandor Ferenczi and, uh, and Rank, uh, were both, uh, dismayed by what they saw as the increasing length of therapy. And they, themselves, began to search for briefer ways of treating, uh, patients. And as, and, and as a matter of fact, in, in some ways, they may be considered to be the, the real, uh, forerunners of brief psychotherapy, in, in a psychodynamic sense. As a matter of fact, Rank, uh, in the form of therapy that he devised, which he called will therapy, uh, really conducted brief, dynamic psychotherapy, uh, cases. And was considered a very successful and effective therapist. Uh, in 1946, uh, uh, Thomas French and Franz Alexander published a book, uh, called 'Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy', which, uh, uh, created an enormous furor, but had an extraordinary influence over dynamic psychotherapy. Because what they pointed out- and Franz Alexander was really the driving force behind that- what they pointed out, was that it is possible to help people in a shorter period of time, by changing some of the rules that at that time still surrounded the, the practice of psychoanalysis. And, uh, one of the things that they, uh, that they advocated was, first of all, uh, what they called the principle of flexibility, which meant adapting the therapeutic, uh, process to the needs of the patient, rather than fitting the patient onto the, by now well known, procrustean bit that I know you've all heard about in various, uh, sessions. And, uh, also to focus on the core conflict that the patient presented, and go directly to it. And they hoped, procedure changed. How could it change? It changed in a number of ways. First of all, instead of the patient being on the couch, the patient was face-to-face with the therapist. The therapist involved himself, or herself in a dynamic interaction with the client, rather than, uh, ah, letting the, uh, patient or client simply free associate with relatively few interventions on the part of the therapist. So the whole process became a more active, interactive, uh, what Hen-, Harry Stack Sullivan called a participant observer interaction between the patient/client and the therapist. Now, what is it that we look for? And, and of course, I might say, in the years intervening since 1946, uh, the influence of that book, which I highly recommend to you. I don't know if it's still in print or not, uh, but it's certainly worth digging up in the library and looking at, if you haven't, uh, seen it or if you can't get it. Uh, has, the influence of that book has spread enormously. And uh, uh, there has been a growing interest in the practice of brief psychotherapy. Now there are social factors, uh, behind that as well as, uh, as, uh, realistic therapeutic ones. The social factors are that we are in an age of, of, uh, accountability, uh, third party payers are, uh, increasing in number, uh, the availability of, uh, uh, funds for long analyses going on for many years is no longer, uh, as free as it was in the earlier days. And the necessity for helping patients, with a much greater pool of patients requiring help and asking for help, and realizing that help is available, has, uh, all, have all combined to make the, uh, practice and theory of, of short term therapy, uh, much more, uh, imperative than it ever was before. What do we look for in a patient? What determines whether or not we're going to consider short term therapy? Apart from the realistic facts that a patient may not be able to afford long term therapy. That's not a good reason. That's a constraint upon us, but the reasons have to be positive ones rather than negative ones. First we look for a patient who is, who has a focal conflict, whose, whose problems can be, uh, defined in terms of a central problem. What are, what are we looking for there? We're looking for the trunk of the tree. In a sense, the practice of traditional psychoanalysis consisted of trimming the tree down, leaf by leaf, dream by dream, free association by free association. We can't afford that luxury any longer. We want to get to the trunk of the tree, and get to the heart of the problem. So we have to define what that trunk is. And we have to be dealing with a problem that we can define in terms of a trunk, of a focal conflict. Then we have to have a patient who is strongly motivated. Now, motivation, in terms of brief therapy, which is designed, not merely as symptom removal, but in dynamic therapy, at affecting some change in the adaptive capacity of the individual, in the ability of the individual to cope with life more constructively, more adaptively, more effectively. So we're aiming at more than just the removal of symptoms. And therefore we are looking for clients who recognize the need to change the way they think and feel and act, with regard to their life problems. Then we want to find patients whose adaptive capacities are such. And by adaptive capacities, we mean, not merely their intelligence, uh, but their capacity to cope with life in various ways. You know, uh, in the old days, when you defined the patient who was most desirable for long term psychoanalysis, they were defined in terms of the, uh, of the acronym which was called Yavis, Y-A-V-I-S. Which stood for young, attractive, verbal, intelligent and successful. You might ask yourself, why would anyone with all those attributes need any help? But sometimes people with those attributes do need help. However, uh, ironically and paradoxically, those are precisely the patients who are most likely to be effective candidates for short term therapy, also. Uh, because those are individuals with good ego adaptive capacities. Uh, I won't go into a description of how you define, how you determine that. Perhaps in the course of, uh, my interchanges with any one of you, we can come, uh, we can lay that out a little more carefully. Then, uh, the important, another very important dynamic factor in short term dynamic therapy is the setting of a time limit. Now, Freud was one of the very first people to set a time limit in his famous analysis of the Wolfman. But he never made it a cardinal principle of his therapy. In a way, Rank was the, Philhelm Rank, was the first man who made it a, a, uh, basic factor of his, uh . . . Otto Rank. Excuse me, Otto Rank was the man who made it a basic factor in his, uh, will therapy. He set a time limit. And what is the importance of a time limit? When you have a patient whom you're planning to do long term therapy on, the traditional response when the patient would say, how long would it take me to get better, the answer was, I don't know. Uh, it may be a year, may be two years. We'll have to see how it goes. Now, that creates a certain kind of expectation in the patient's mind. The expectation is, this is a long term, difficult problem. It's gonna take a long time for me and the therapist to overcome it. In setting a time limit that says we're going to work for 10 visits, or 12 visits, or 15, or 20, or maybe even 40, we are nevertheless saying to the patient/client, this is a problem that can be helped, can be dealt with within a, a specific time limit. That means you're not a chronic invalid. This is not a problem that you have to live with forever. It's something that, together, we can solve and work on more dynamically and more effectively. That casts a totally different ambience over the kind of therapy that you're doing. Now, one of the things we also look for in, in, uh, uh, the, the patient who, who would be a suitable, uh, patient, is whether or not that individual is in touch with his or her feelings. In, in the course of the preliminary interview- and the preliminary interview is obviously a very critical one in dete-, coming to a decision about short term therapy- you want to know, does the individual recognize sadness, uh, pain, needs, wishes, hurts. Uh, to what degree does the patient face his or her feelings? Or, to what degree does the patient deny feelings? If the patient is not in touch with feelings, they're going to be much more difficult to treat in a, uh, short term situation. And another thing we want to know very early in our work with a patient is this: Has the patient ever had a meaningful relationship with another human being? Patients who have never had a really close, intimate, meaningful relationship with another human being, are not good patients for short term therapy. They are going to be difficult patients. For one thing, they're going to have a difficult time forming a meaningful relationship with you, as the therapist. And for another, there's something frozen in them that needs to be unfrozen. And, it generally takes a long time. These are individuals with difficult personality problems, narcissistic disorders, borderline personality disorders, who have been strongly damaged, either by, uh, by, uh, specific actions, or by deprivations in the course of their early upbringing. Given those factors and those elements in, in the presenting client, we then try to set a time limit. And then we work actively, interactively with the client. Now, I would like to demonstrate that a little bit, uh, with anyone here who has a problem, uh, with a short term patient, or a potential problem that they would like to discuss. Is there anyone here in the audience who has such a problem that you would like to present, or, or a question that you would like to bring up with regard to short term dynamic therapy? Don't, don't all rush the stage at once. Yes. Uh, could you come to a microphone and, uh, say what you want to say? Or come up here. 

00:15:25
[sil.] 

00:15:25
UNKNOWN Yes. I inherited a client that, uh, has been working for a long time with, uh, phobias. And, uh, this, you know, in this conference, I have heard that that is something that can be very much helped within a day or two, or a visit or two. And I know that he has been in, uh, counseling for a long time. And now that I am working with him, I would like to know what can be done immediately, or very fast for him. His phobia is so that . . . he has agoraphobia, and he has not been able to live, to leave, uh, the place where he lives, which is a very small town of about 3,000 people. He has not left that city for over 12 years. 

00:16:20
JUDD MARMOR Will you go slowly? How, how old is the patient? 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN Uh, I would say about 42. 

00:16:25
JUDD MARMOR A male or female? 

00:16:25
UNKNOWN A male. 

00:16:30
JUDD MARMOR Yes. Yes. Go ahead. 

00:16:35
UNKNOWN What else would you like to know? What else would I tell you? 

00:16:35
JUDD MARMOR Well, uh, I need to know something about the patient. 

00:16:40
UNKNOWN OK. Uh, the man has one job. He works very much . . . 

00:16:45
JUDD MARMOR Well, tell me something. Would you mind coming up here talking to me face to face? 

00:16:50
UNKNOWN Sure. 

00:16:50
JUDD MARMOR I think it would make for a more meaningful interaction. 

00:16:55
UNKNOWN The client is about 40, 42 years of age. He has had agoraphobia since he was about 17. But it became, uh, uh, very, very bad for him just . . . He is almost confined to his quarters since he is about 22 . Uh, the last time that he went to church was about 13 , 14 years ago. And while in church, he had a panic attack, and decided never to go back to church. He goes to the store when necessary . And sometimes, uh, he has to leave the, uh, uh, merchandise that he has picked up, and run out of there, because he's so afraid that something terrible is going to happen . He has almost no friends. He does work. But he is isolated from the rest of the, uh, peers that work in the same place. He works in a lab all by himself. Um, what else? He has been married several times. And, uh, the last time he has been married for about three or four years. And, uh, it seems to be a very difficult situation for the family. Because he refuses to go anyplace. Uh, his wife goes out to eat, or goes out with friends. But he just cannot leave the place to go anyplace to, to have any fun or do anything, not even to the market . Uh, does that cover it? 

00:18:35
JUDD MARMOR Well, uh, well, there's a great deal more that we would need to know about him. Let me, uh, let me ask you this. Uh, what kind of a, uh, background did he have? What kind of a childhood, what kind of parents? 

00:18:55
UNKNOWN His mother died when he was about four years old. And, uh, the father remarried. There was a younger sister, two years younger than he. And the stepmother was only about 15, 16 years old when she came to live with them. And at first, uh, she was nice and kind to the little kids. But after a while, she didn't know how. And, uh, he always felt unwanted, and, you know, he was a, a burden to his stepmother and father . He defends, very much, the, the, uh, father. Says it was a very good situation, just wonderful. And I haven't been able to discover, but I have a suspicion that there was a lot of abuse. 

00:19:40
JUDD MARMOR Well, there's so much. This is really a, a very complicated case, because, uh, it's, there's not, it's not, this is not simply a matter of agoraphobia. We're dealing with a man whose, ah, entire life development has been colored by certain traumatic events. But let us focus for a moment on the agoraphobia. You say it began 13 or 14 years ago, while he was in church? 

00:20:10
UNKNOWN No, that, all, he already had it. But that's when it got the worse, was when he stopped going to any kind of gatherings, was the last time he went to any social or church event, or whatever. 

00:20:25
JUDD MARMOR Do you know at what point the agoraphobia first began, first showed itself? 

00:20:30
UNKNOWN Uh, he was about 17 years old, and he was in high school, when he wouldn't go to any of the, uh, games or the, uh, school activities . And just continued to get worse. 

00:20:40
JUDD MARMOR Was there a sce-, a particular dramatic incident that he remembers, at which it first appeared? 

00:20:50
UNKNOWN He does not remember anything. 

00:20:50
JUDD MARMOR Do, did it, was it something that developed gradually and subtly? 

00:20:55
UNKNOWN He feels, yeah, he was always scared of people and of situations, and kept getting worse. And at about age 22 was when he, uh, stopped going places, really. Or went very seldom, very little, to markets and anyplace else. He doesn't visit relatives or anything. 

00:21:15
JUDD MARMOR Yeah. Uh, in my, in my opinion, uh, this is not a case that could be resolved in, uh, in terms of short term dynamic psychotherapy. However, one can do something very quickly for the symptom, itself. UAh, this is one of the situations in which, uh, first of all, medication, uh, is often most helpful. The use of a small amount of an anti-, of a tricyclic antidepressant, or of one of the benzodiazepines, like, uh, Xanax or, uh, or, uh, Ativan, is often very dramatic in, uh, in lowering the level of apprehension, and enabling the individual to go out. Uh, also, this is a case in which the symptom might be dealt with in behavioral terms, by a pattern of desensitization. And, uh, if you are aware of the techniques of desensitization, and can gradually expose the patient, gradually to, uh, increasing amounts of, of exposure, uh, even walking with the patient for longer and longer distances, and finally allowing him to do so on a gradual desensitization program, that can be done. As far as the psychodynamic aspects of it, in terms of trying to increase his total adaptive capacity to cope with life more effectively, cuz this man is more than just an agoraphobic. He's a, he's a withdrawn individual who has, uh, had several marriages, obviously, not very successful, has no friends, which I consider a rather serious indicator of, of a lack of capacity to relate. This is a man who is dealing with his failure at ego adaptive abilities by withdrawing from life. And in a sense, uh, you might even define his agoraphobia as his adaptive way of trying to deal with his limitations. Unfortunately, however, it's a very maladaptive way of trying to cope. Uh, I, uh, I, I would not consider this a suitable case for short term dynamic psychotherapy. 

00:23:50
UNKNOWN OK. I would like to say that the previous counselor did try to send him, to have him go, take him to a medical doctor for medications. And could not. They arrived to the door, and he almost fainted on him. There was no way that he would go to the doctor's office. And, uh, that happened a year or so ago. 

00:24:10
JUDD MARMOR Uh, that, that is interesting. It sounds as though he is really, unconsciously, not deliberately, but unconsciously, trying to hold on to his symptom. Uh, that there is a, an actual fear of coming to grips with that. That can be dealt with gradually, but I do not think we can deal with it on a short term basis. 

00:24:35
UNKNOWN Thank you very much. 

00:24:35
JUDD MARMOR Thank you. Is there anyone else who would like to present a problem? Yes. Please. Would you come up, please? 

00:24:40
SUE Uh, my propensity is, is usually to work in long term therapy with someone. But I have a, a new client, a client that is new to me. I've seen her about two times. 

00:24:50
JUDD MARMOR Can you all hear? 

00:24:55
SUE Can you hear me? 

00:24:55
UNKNOWN No. 

00:24:55
SUE Oh. Uh, I have a client that I've seen about two times. Uh, my propensity would be to deal with her in long, longer term dynamic treatment. But I think she matches the kind of criteria that, uh, would be appropriate for the kind of, of treatment that you're, that, that you, uh, postulate. And so I thought maybe I would . . . 

00:25:15
JUDD MARMOR Would you tell me about her? 

00:25:15
SUE Yeah. She is, uh, a 42, 42 or 44 year old woman . She is a, uh, college instructor . She, uh, her presenting problem was that she has, she feels that she has lived her life exclusively emphasizing her vocational, uh, the vocational side of her, uh, to the exclusion of the interpersonal side of her. Uh, she has had one significant romantic relationship. It was a lesbian relationship. Uh, sh-, her history is that she is the oldest daughter, no, she is the middle daughter, uh, in a family that, who . . . Her mother was married twice. The oldest daughter is- from the first marriage- is extremely estranged from the, from the mother. And, in fact, my client did not know that her father was not her older sister's daughter. I mean, her older sister's, um, the, the daughter of her father, until she was in her mid-teens. Uh, as the oldest daughter in this, as the oldest of two children of this particular union, she felt a tremendous responsibility for her mother. She was suicidal early in, uh . . . 

00:26:50
JUDD MARMOR Are you talking about your patient now? 

00:26:50
SUE I'm talking about my patient now. 

00:26:50
JUDD MARMOR (inaudible ) 

00:26:54
SUE Uh, she was, she had one in-, episode of becoming suicidal as she was trying to separate from her mom. Uh, her, her younger sister lived with her mother until, uh, about two years ago. Her younger sister is in her late 30's or early 40's at this time. Uh, the father was, uh, frequently absent from home, uh, abusive, frequently towards the mother, uh, occasionally towards, towards his children. Uh, but is described as a very gregarious man, uh, to, to outsiders. Superficially, very gregarious. He . . . 

00:27:40
JUDD MARMOR Very what? 

00:27:40
SUE Gregarious. 

00:27:40
JUDD MARMOR Yes. 

00:27:40
SUE Um, he was a, a, worked on a cruise ship. So he was frequently absent from, from the home. Mother is very, very, uh, private. And my client has a terrible difficulty ex-, uh, exposing any kind of, of, exposing herself, period. She's, she's worked very hard. She came into psychotherapy, and has worked extremely hard at being self disclosive in this environment, feeling that this is a doctor/patient relationship, and that she has much more freedom to talk about herself. But as far as I can tell, she's almost, she discloses almost nothing about herself, uh, in her, in her day to day life. 

00:28:25
JUDD MARMOR What does the patient, what did the client come to you with? What kind of a complaint, or presentation? 

00:28:30
SUE The, the, the presentation was that she had, uh, no friendships, and, and no intimate relationships. As I said, she's had one intimate relationship. The relationship lasted about six or seven years. It was a lesbian relationship. She questions her sexual orientation. Her mother does not know that that was a romantic liaison. 

00:28:55
JUDD MARMOR And that relationship terminated? 

00:29:00
SUE That relationship terminated about two years ago. 

00:29:05
JUDD MARMOR And no relationships with men? 

00:29:05
SUE Uh, actually, early, uh, in high school, she did have relationships with, with men. Uh, she, she does not describe herself as . . . She, she describes herself as uncertain about her sexual orientation, although it seems to be more lesbian than heterosexual. 

00:29:25
JUDD MARMOR More or less what? 

00:29:25
SUE More lesbian than heterosexual. 

00:29:25
JUDD MARMOR I see. So she's not particularly drawn to men, erotically? 

00:29:30
SUE Uh, it doesn't, she doesn't appear to be drawn to anyone, erotically. She seems to be fairly asexual. 

00:29:40
JUDD MARMOR How did she relate to you? 

00:29:45
SUE Although she seemed extremely anxious, she seemed to work very hard at being self disclosive. I find her to be, I, I find her delightful. Uh, she is, she is very eager for, she is very eager for anything I might say to her. Uh, she, she is looking hard for direction. My tendency is to, is to be nondirective. 

00:30:10
JUDD MARMOR Mm-hmm. 

00:30:10
SUE Uh, and, and I have only had a couple of sessions with her, so I really don't, I don't have a good flavor of what, of what kind of intensity is going to be in the therapeutic relationship. 

00:30:25
JUDD MARMOR Do you, do you have a sense of making contact with her? 

00:30:30
SUE Yes. She, uh, she, as a matter of fact, in the non-verbal (inaudible ) therapy, it's very contactful, um, . . . 

00:30:36
JUDD MARMOR Mm-hmm. 

00:30:36
SUE . . . intense. 

00:30:36
JUDD MARMOR You have the feeling that she's in touch with her feelings? 

00:30:40
SUE She is in touch with s-, with some of her feelings. She, she is occasionally tearful, appropriately. Uh, she is very cut off, effectively, from how she might feel about her mom or the situation in her family. Uh, she seems very far away from ang-, feelings of anger. Uh, but she is not . . . She struggles with feelings, and, and so she, she has some- she has some of them accessible to her. 

00:31:15
JUDD MARMOR Mm-hmm. Uh, what, uh, what happened in her lesbian relationship? Why did it come to an end? 

00:31:20
SUE As best I can tell, uh, she, she took on the relationship in the way similar to the way she takes on her job. By working very, very, very hard at it. To the exclusion of spontaneous kinds of intimacy, uh, where she worked very hard to please her partner, to make sure that her partner was happy, comfortable with her. Uh, and the partner, and it didn't seem, it doesn't seem to have been a terribly reciprocal relationship. The partner seemed to be distant, absent often, uh, demanding. 

00:32:05
JUDD MARMOR Was your client in love? 

00:32:05
SUE She would describe it that way. 

00:32:10
JUDD MARMOR She would describe herself as having been in love? 

00:32:15
SUE She would've described, yeah, she would describe herself as having been in love. 

00:32:15
JUDD MARMOR Yeah. Now, let me point out that, uh, . . . Don't leave yet. 

00:32:20
SUE I'm not. 

00:32:20
JUDD MARMOR . . . uh, uh, that, uh. What, this, this is a situation which might well lend itself to short term therapy. I don't think it would lend itself to 6 or 8, or 10 or 12 visits. But possibly to 20 or 30 or 40. Uh, I'd know better after I saw her. What, what is a way we would work with a patient like this? Uh, first of all, I think, after the initial evaluation, uh, the important element is the activity of the therapist. The, the pro-, in short term therapy, the therapist has to be a very active person. Now, that does not mean directive. That does not mean telling the patient, or client, what to do. But it means constantly confronting and interacting with the client. And using the dynamic interaction between you as a way of demonstrating, uh, certain qualities of the patient. For example, uh, I remember a, uh- and this is not an infrequent occurrence- uh, uh, I was five minutes late for a, for our session. And, uh, the, uh, patient, a woman, uh, came in, uh, with a very slight frown on her face, but, uh, didn't say anything. I said we're, I'm, I'm sorry I was late. Did, uh, were you bothered by it? No, no, no. I said, but I saw a frown on your face. Well, I, I did, I did feel a little annoyed. Well, now there's several things. One is we want to bring out the feeling. But secondly, you also want to demonstrate, in the immediate interaction, the fact that the client was unable to bring out the feeling, and to emphasize the importance of being of a total, totally honest relationship. I think the, one of the elements in the therapist/client interaction in short term therapy, is the pressure towards total honesty. And the, the willingness to face negative reactions on the part of the patient. Not to run away from them. It's much more comfortable to gloss it over for the therapist. But the therapist must be strong enough to be willing to face the patient's anger, the patient's disappointment, uh, the patient's irritations, or whatever. And also the patient's fantasies and, uh, and, uh, expectations that may be unexpressed. In, in the course of the short term approach, where you're sitting face to face with a patient, and interacting, involving yourself, uh, with whatever techniques you are able to mobilize in terms of your own personality. Humor, uh, forcefulness- but not, not paternalistic, not maternalistic, not authoritarian. But a, an insistence that the client face the central problem. Face, in this, in this situation, you're dealing with an individual who has difficulty in intimacy. In the course of your relationship, you're going to have to develop a kind of intimate relationship that demands total honesty, that brings out your honesty as well as the client's honesty. And it, you involve yourself in a much harder working relationship with your client, uh, than you would to be able to sit back in a long term relationship and say, well, if we don't do it today, we'll do it tomorrow, or we'll do it, uh, a couple of days from now. Every session has to be a meaningful interactive, dynamic session. And, and if you can do that, you can mobilize feeling. Uh, the, another thing about the short term approach is that you do not focus on historical material as a primary goal. Uh, the goal is not to bring up repressed memories. Now I know that's, uh, to some of you this may seem a little heretical. There's such a long tradition in, uh, psychotherapy to assume that somewhere or other, there's a traumatic memory buried, and if we can only bring that out, lo and behold, there'll be a transformation on the part of the client, and the problem will disappear. It doesn't work that way, unfortunately. Uh, the important thing is to find out what the individual is doing in the here and now relationship. How does the patient, or client, work in relationship to you, in relationship to current, uh, uh, colleagues, friends, relatives, uh, intimate people. And constantly focusing on the problem of how she relates to them, uh, in the here and now. Now, in the course of doing that, memories will come up. I'm not saying we should reject the memories. As a matter of fact, in the first couple of sessions, we try to reconstruct a historical developmental thing to get as much of a background on the, uh, patient's, client's development as you can. But once you start working, you work with the here and now. You work with the interaction between you and the client, and the focus on what is going on in the presence life of the client, how that relates to any past events that you can bring to bear to show the relationship between the current behavior and past behavior. And also, how it reflects itself in your relationship to you. This is what Carl Meneger called the triangle of insight. You, you relate the events in the client's present life to events in the client's past life, to ways of relating to you, in the, in the transference, counter-transference interaction with you. Now, uh, do you have any questions about that? 

00:38:50
SUE Well, maybe, another, uh . . . Last week we had our third session. Sh-, the relationships she does have are with respect to the, her job. She is in a situation where she has a boss who is, uh, distant, critical. Uh, and a, and a coworker who has not been on the job, nor is she tenured, who she sees as not being nearly as competent, but being the favorite of the, of the boss. Now, it, it is a, it is a social, it's an interactional pattern that recapitulates, beautifully, the earlier history with, between her mother and her sister and herself. 

00:39:40
JUDD MARMOR Yeah. Now that, that is something that we often call a triangular situation, that comes up again and again in the lives of people like this. The, the rivalry between the mother surrogate, the sister surrogate, and the client. And it repeats itself in various ways, in the course of the life. And by pointing out how she is handling that, and how she might be able to handle that more effectively, uh, you can cut through this a bit. 

00:40:10
SUE She, uh, she is feeling, currently . . . In our last session, she was, she was terribly fearful that she was about to be reprimanded by her, by her employ-, by her boss, you know, the head of her department, uh, because she had received some negative student evaluations. And, in the session previously, she had alluded to it, and I had, in working with her, not been able to deter-, not been able to, to identify any ways that she had really communicated or, or interacted with her boss. In a terribly pathological way, it seemed like she was, uh, that she was over-fearing the negative consequences. But in the third session, uh, in fact, there had been negative student comments. She was about to be, be reprimanded by her instructor, I mean by her, the chairman of her department. Uh, and, and still, in the description, to the best that I could determine, it did seem as if the, uh, chairman of the department was being overly punitive, and overly taking into account complaints of students that my, that my client was not being collegial, as a professor. 

00:41:30
JUDD MARMOR Mm-hmm. 

00:41:30
SUE And I, I, so I was having troubles trying to figure out how to identify the pathology in, in my client's interactions with her, with her boss. 

00:41:40
JUDD MARMOR Well, I, I, you know, I don't feel that I know enough yet . . . 

00:41:45
SUE Right. 

00:41:45
JUDD MARMOR . . . to be a, to be decisive about any of these things. But I would say, I would not hesitate to confront these things. But the way you confront them is important. If you say, you failed to do this, or, it seems to me you that failed to do this, you are being critical. You're being a critical parent. Uh, I, you want to give, always give your client an outlet. I think it's important to make your confrontations tentative. Is it possible that? Is it, is, do you think that perhaps you contributed to this in this or that way? That gives a client an opportunity to say, no, I don't think so. But it also, uh, does not come down as a critical condemnation. Uh, one of the things that impresses me that I don't, you know, that I, I would certainly want to know more about, is the relationship with her mother. Because obviously, the mother was not a totally forthcoming person with this client. To, to have a, a half-sister and not know that she was your half-sister until your teens, sounds as though the mother was a very withholding person, and would, would, uh, speak for a potential distrust of, uh, of intimacy because you don't know what's behind the other person's relationship to you. 

00:43:15
SUE My, my client was overtly counseled to not take things out of the family. To not talk about anything that happened within the family, outside of the family. And she identifies that as the ideology of why it's so difficult for her to be self-disclosive with, with friends and peers, and potential partners. 

00:43:30
JUDD MARMOR Yeah. Right. Right. Now, what she is going to have to learn in the relationship with you, is that it is possible to trust another human being, and to trust them fully. And to count on their empathic, uh, dependability. And, in the course of weekly visits, over, I would say, perhaps 30 or, somewhere between 30 and 40 visits, seems to me you could make decisive inroads into this problem. I would guess that in the, in the, uh, to say that on a weekly basis, you would expect to be through within a year, or less. 

00:44:10
SUE OK. 

00:44:10
JUDD MARMOR And then as you go along, and you see her making progress, you can set a termination date, uh, somewhere in the range of 40 or 45 visits, possibly. 

00:44:20
SUE OK. 

00:44:20
JUDD MARMOR Uh, I, I think this is a client that could respond to, uh, a very effective, empathic, warm, but incisive, uh, relationship with a therapist who understood her. 

00:44:40
SUE And focusing on self-disclosure and, and intimacy, . . . 

00:44:40
JUDD MARMOR Absolutely. 

00:44:40
SUE . . . both in the context of her . . . 

00:44:45
JUDD MARMOR Yes. 

00:44:45
SUE . . . work relationships, and in the context of the therapeutic relationships. 

00:44:45
JUDD MARMOR In, in, in the relationship with you, in the relationship, in her work relationship, in her collegial relationship, and tying it in also with the past, wherever it becomes clear to you. 

00:45:00
SUE Would I, would I directly encourage her to, uh, take risks around self-disclosure? 

00:45:00
JUDD MARMOR Well, I, I, I think one encourages clients to take risks, but in graduated steps. You don't encourage a client to take steps, or risks that clearly, uh, might subject her to failure. Uh, success in, in life and personality development, and in therapy depends on a series of graduated successes, a series of little successes that build up the self-confidence of the individual and enable the individual to move further. So, I would not hesitate to encourage a client to move forward, but only in situations where the prospect of success is very great. 

00:45:55
SUE OK. Thank you. 

00:45:55
JUDD MARMOR Thank you. Anyone else out there would like to raise a question? 

00:46:00
UNKNOWN I'd like to ask a question about that case. 

00:46:05
JUDD MARMOR About this last case? 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. About, um, I, I was hearing her, her, uh, identifying with her client. And I'm wondering if you would discuss counter-transferential issues in short term treatment? 

00:46:15
JUDD MARMOR How you use identification with the client? In short term . . . 

00:46:20
UNKNOWN It seems that she was identifying with her client's dilemma with her boss. 

00:46:25
JUDD MARMOR Yes. 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN Which raises counter transferential issues. I think. I, I'm wondering if you can discuss that . . . 

00:46:35
JUDD MARMOR Yeah. Do you wanna, do you want to elaborate on that? How you see that? 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN Uh, it seems to me that, I, I'm not totally, have a clear picture. But it seems to me, that for her to be helpful with that woman, she needs to shift her position. Uh, because I was hearing, and I may have, it may not have been accurate. But it seemed that she, uh, was identifying with her client in being angry at the boss. And that seemed like the thrust of the treatment at this point, which might have been intentional, or helpful. But it also seems that it's not where she, I'm not sure if that's where she wants to be going, in treatment, in short term treatment. 

00:47:20
JUDD MARMOR Well, I see your point. I see your point, and certainly if that were true, uh, one would have to be on guard about that. I, I was under the impression that she also recognized that the client, uh, that the boss had some justification in criticizing the client, and that the client had indeed not handled her relationships with her students or colleagues as well as she might. Which sounds like a, perhaps, a more objective, uh, evaluation than you, than you came away with. But, that certainly is something worth looking into. Certainly, if we, if we become over identified with a client, to a point where we're unable to objectify what is going on actually, uh, we then fail to give the, the client the kind of understanding that she deserves from us. Uh, but I'm not prepared to judge that, one way or the other, on the basis of the little information that I have at this point. Perhaps Sue, who presented the case, might want to respond to that. Are you around, Sue, anywhere? 

00:48:30
SUE (inaudible ) 

00:48:33
JUDD MARMOR If you'll take the microphone. Please. 

00:48:40
SUE Hi. Uh, I was trying to be aware of the counter-transference issues. I, I, I, and I think that the question is a really critical one. Uh, my sense is that she has, she both has under disclosive, and sets herself up for difficult interactions with her boss. Uh, and that her boss really is, has many qualities that make it especially easy for her to, to mix her boss up, if you will, with her mom. Uh, and that, so that, I see it being, I mean, I, I'm trying to keep clear in my own mind that this is a, this is an interactional system and that there are some dysfunctional interaction going on on both sides. 

00:49:35
JUDD MARMOR All right. Any other comments or questions? 

00:49:35
UNKNOWN Uh, yes. Yes. 

00:49:40
JUDD MARMOR It's hard for me to see out there in the darkness. 

00:49:50
UNKNOWN Over here. 

00:49:50
JUDD MARMOR The, uh. The, le-, let. Oh, yes. Please. 

00:49:55
UNKNOWN Um, I just have a brief question, because I think she just showed you the sign that we just have a few minutes left. I am a practicing psychiatrist in the West Texas area. And . . . 

00:50:05
JUDD MARMOR Would you, would you come up here? I could hear you better and, and be more responsive to you, if you don't mind. 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN I'm a practicing psychiatrist in the West Texas area, and all I have really been doing, or trying to limit myself doing is short term dynamic psychotherapy. Because I simply don't have the time to see all the patients that are being referred to me. I happen to be, also, the only psychiatrist in the area that does psychotherapy. And everybody . . . And I work very well with the, uh, psychologist community, and I really enjoy working with them. Uh, my brief dynamic psychotherapy, I've got, uh, I've got a lot of cases that, since residency, that I think are very good examples of successful brief dynamic psychotherapy. But my question is, now that I am in private practice, and I've got a lot of other things, administrative wise, to do, there are some patients that, at the first evaluation, I would have thought that they would be perfect candidates for short term dynamic psychotherapy, given the criteria that we have discussed. And then, in the, uh, multitudinal follow-up, it is not very uncommon that you, you, uh, further realize that this patients have much longer term conflicts that need to be addressed in longer term psychotherapy. And I really don't like to have cases like that. But I end up, you know, having them. Now, is there a way to make a very good transition referring them out, after you have made, let's say, for example, after 10 to 12 sessions, you know, we have not really been able to achieve, you know, the short term goal that we have. And I, as well as the patient have convinced, you know, ourselves, that she needs much longer term therapy. And they're able to, like, for example, financially. Uh, I don't know if it's even wise, but, like, patients that need to be seen once or twice a week . . . Let's say you determine that in the fourth or fifth session. I simply just don't have the time to see them twice a week. Now, how, how do you do that, you know, without, of course, uh, creating problems like abandonment, rejection, and things like that? 

00:52:50
JUDD MARMOR Well, I think, first of all, one way in which you deal with it is with absolute honesty. Uh, we live in an imperfect world. We're not able to do all of the things we would like to do if we were able to do them. Uh, I think that when you, if you have seriously misjudged the possibility of helping the patient thoroughly, uh, within, uh, a dozen visits, and then find at the end of a dozen visits that it's not possible, I think you must, you still have to terminate, but terminate with a hopeful, uh, with a hopeful, uh, note, that regretfully you have to terminate. You recognize that there is still work to be done. You hope that at some future time, you can pick up again. Encourage the patient to give her or himself an opportunity to work with what they've picked up within the dozen visits with you. Uh, give them the opportunity to come back and see you at a later time to review the situation, if possible. Uh, and then, see where you go from there. One of the things that, uh . . . My time is almost up, but I want to make one point that I made at a previous symp-, at a previous meeting here today. Some of you may have already heard me say it. Uh, the assumption that we can cure people in short term therapy is a false assumption. Cure-, the concept of cure in psychotherapy, in itself, needs to be reviewed. We don't cure people, we open the door to change. We open the door to growth. If we have succeeded even in prying that door open a little bit, our work has not been without value. So, I think it's on that note, that if, if the clients come in and expect, within 12 visits or 20 visits, or 40 visits, that at the end of that period, they're going to be, quote, cured and free from problems, we have misinformed them. What we have to emphasize is that the excitement and the challenge of life is the ability to keep growing and learning new ways of dealing with life, as long as we are given to live. And if we can end our therapy on that note, no matter when or how we have to end it, I think we are doing our patients a much greater service. I think we had better stop now. I'm, I see the signal that we've run out of time. Thank you.
