Reflections and Paraphrases 

00:00:35
I went of to um… Nottingham this week conference but the weather was really bad as I was driving up the vehicle very-very slowly. And the worst thing was that I miss the start of the session. I really wish you know that I’d gone at the night before. 

00:00:50
MIKE SIMMONS So the weather was so bad that you couldn’t get there on time? 

00:00:55
Yeah, yeah. I got my holidays all planed two weeks at Tuscany with my husband on our own. Right, I've planned it, we’ve paid for everything. He came home from work yesterday and he said you know mom’s been ill, don’t you think it will be a good idea if she came along with us for a rest. And I just blew absolutely lost it. 

00:01:25
MIKE SIMMONS You’re really angry with him. 

00:01:30
God, that’s put (inaudible ). I’ve really been trying hard to study for my degree, but last month my dad had a heart attack, so my mom has been really depending on me. And I just haven't been able to put the work in no matter how hard I try. 

00:01:55
MIKE SIMMONS So looking after your mom has meant you haven’t been able to do your college work as much as you would have like to have done. 

00:02:00
Yeah and it’s running away with me. 

00:02:05
[sil.] 

00:02:10
Oh, since my husband left I feel so sad and alone, I felt we had everything, a good relationship, a future ahead of us. And then he met his mom and my whole world is just caved in. I don’t know what to do, because I still love him. 

00:02:35
MIKE SIMMONS Sounds like it's really bewildering, you don’t know what’s happened, you don’t know what to do and then so you’ve isolated in the middle of all that. 

00:02:45
Yeah. You know the thing is, I think I could have coped with… 

00:02:55
I was on the way home from cinema last night with my… with my friend and we saw this… this elderly guy who’ve been mugged and you know we… we just went in and helped. And my friend got kicked in the stomach for it, I really don’t, I’m not gonna get involved again. 

00:03:15
MIKE SIMMONS So you got involved in helping someone and as a result your friend suffered for it. 

00:03:20
Oh very much so we had to… Last week the guy that I’ve been working with all this year was promoting over me, it was such a shock. I mean I’ve been working here all this time and it’s like they’ve completely ignored what I’ve done? 

00:03:45
MIKE SIMMONS Sounds like you feel just push to one side. 

00:03:45
Oh absolutely, it’s a different… I went for medical tests this morning and the doctor phoned and he said would I come in… Oh I’m really scared I… I’ve just don’t, I can’t image what it is and I don’t know what I’ll do if some thing is wrong. 

00:04:10
MIKE SIMMONS It’s like you just filled with apprehension what’s gonna happen. 

00:04:15
Yeah… yeah something like this… Oh, I’ve made up to my eyes in work, I’ve been really desperate to get things cleared, so I can go out for my holiday and just forget it. And then in comes my line manager and he says do this bit, you know Jack’s of sick. I’m sure you can just finished it before you go off an holiday. And I just put it down and walked out. 

00:04:45
MIKE SIMMONS So just before you’re going to go on a holiday your boss tried to give you some extra work. And you actually left and walk out. 

00:04:55
Yeah, I don’t think he’s got an… My little boy is being bullied in school and I feel a bit alone in all of this. I mean I’m trying to support him but then his father comes back and he say things like “let him fight it out, it… it will make him (inaudible )” and I’m so angry with my husband for saying that. 

00:05:25
MIKE SIMMONS It’s like you’re on your little boy’s side, but your husband is on your side. 

00:05:30
No… 

00:05:30
MIKE SIMMONS And you’re really angry with him. 

00:05:30
Yeah, very angry with him. 

00:05:35
[sil.] 

00:05:40
I bought a new car yesterday, right I’ve been waiting for ages for it. But it was well worth of it, I can’t walk, just can’t wait now for my partner to come home this weekend and show it to him. 

00:05:50
MIKE SIMMONS See you got a new car and your partner is coming home this weekend and then you both look at it. 

00:05:55
Yeah, but he will be really jealous, because…

Client Statements 

00:06:15
Just taken up smoking again after three years. Really thought I had to crack this time. 

00:06:25
[sil.] 

00:06:30
I’ve just told with my best friends that I’m gay and now I just frighten that my parents are going to find out. 

00:06:40
[sil.] 

00:06:45
I share a flat(ph) with somebody at work, she never clears up, she is always boring my stuff, I’m really getting fed up with it. 

00:06:55
I moved to here from London a few months ago and I feel so isolated from everybody. I met one or two people at work but other than that I don’t know anybody, it’s really getting me down. 

00:07:10
I… I’m a bit confused I’d, I had quite a lot to drink on Saturday night and I wake up in Cardiff, I think it wasn't, I was really confused and my car was missing and I just, I don’t what happened. I can’t remember very much I’m a bit so confused about the whole situation really. 

00:07:35
[sil.] 

00:07:40
I’m in big trouble. I made a mistake in a specification for a client at work and the whole project has been approved including my mistake. Sooner or later it’s all gonna come to the surface that it was my fault. The company is… the company is going to loss thousands and it will be my head on the block. 

00:08:05
People say it that… that I really shouldn’t let this bother me, but kids the in our street um… we’ve got a open plant street and they're always playing ball and they run all over the garden and they break my flower and they won’t be told and their parents don’t seem to care and it just make me so angry. 

00:08:30
[sil.] 

00:08:35
I got pulled over by the police the other day on the way home from the pub and breathalyzed and I just don’t know what’s gonna happen yet. 

00:08:45
I might have been in trouble, I’ve been picked by the police smoking wheel. And they say they're gonna prosecute which means it's going to be on the local paper, which basically means my boss is gonna have to find about it, you know. 

00:09:05
I feel a bit stupid about this really but um… I’m afraid of flying. I’ve only been in the plane once and that was about 30 years ago. Um… it doesn’t really matter much to me but um… it, it really limits when my partner and I can go on holiday he is… he is really good about it. But um… it doesn’t make me feel very good. 

00:09:35
My new girlfriend is great, she pretty, funny and really good company. The trouble is, she’s so relaxed that she just doesn’t seem to bother with her kids… what her kids do. They’re five and seven, they seem to go to bed at all hour. I want to have sometime alone with her, but it seems like they’re always with us. 

00:10:00
A video camera has gone missing from work now they’ve… they’ve accused me of stealing it. And I’m… I’m really-really upset about that, because it’s true I took one home last week, but I had permission you know to… to make a video that’s going to be used for work. And I brought back and I signed it in and everything and now they're saying that I never brought it back and that I’ve stolen it become missing. You know I’m… I’m furious, but I’m also really upset because what’s gonna happen I’m going to lose my job and am I going to, go to jail, I mean I don’t know what to do really. 

00:10:40
The thing is I’ve been going out with this girl for about six months now. Now, I’m in the army and then I'm in northern Ireland and this girl I really-really like you know she… she the best thing ever happened to me. Now the thing is this girl I found out some information about her. And um… her family are in the IRA, I don’t really don’t know what to do about it, because I’m I really like this girl but obviously I'm suppose to say something if I got any… any kind of information or whatsoever so… 

00:11:10
[sil.] 

00:11:15
Focussing 

00:11:25
Okay, I… I… I really feel I can’t do what my husband is asking me to do, he is, he is asking me to, to make a trip that I… I… I really feel too scare to make, because you know it’s the world is a dangerous places and you know you just never know what's going to happen out there. You know anything could happen to me, I feel so vulnerable you know, if I get on a plane or even going on the motorway, it really makes me feel really scared, because you… you just can’t trust other drivers, can you? 

00:12:05
[sil.] 

00:12:10
Oh god I’m fed up and I’m… I’m… I'm in my (inaudible ) end it happened again, I mean every time I meet a nice folk(ph) and I’m alright for a… you know for a bit, it falls apart and this time I really-really felt, we’re going to get married next year and it seems he’s been lying to me, he’s been lying to me for the past year and I thought he was teetotal and because you know I… I don’t drink at all, because I don’t like it and anyway I don’t. And he disappeared for a couple of days and I didn’t know where he was. And then when he came back he was absolutely roaring drunk and actually I was frighten so I… I called a neighbor and the neighbor got him somehow out of the house and I don’t know what made me do it, but I started looking everywhere and I found bottles all over the house and anyway since that he is an alcoholic and I knew nothing about it at all. And I’m devastated now, um… he’s been lying to me. 

00:13:15
[sil.] 

00:13:20
I’m feeling so exposed um… you know, I went for this interview I’d… I’d seen it in the local press and I knew when I read it that I could do it, I have the skills, I have the expertise, I have the experience and I was so confident and they invited me to… to interview and they didn’t say so and you know in exact word, but I knew I had it. I was so hopeful and then I went home and… and I told everybody and they got so excited and… and you know they knew that it would change my life and then I got this letter this morning and it just says I haven’t got the job and I don’t understand why? And I’ve got to tell everybody know that I haven’t got it and I'll feel such a fool. 

00:14:20
[sil.] 

00:14:25
MIKE SIMMONS I’m kind of feeling a bit stupid really I’ve… I’ve, I've lived here for three years, I moved here after my divorce came through I kind of wanting to make a fresh start. And yeah I got quite excited about the move and I got quite excited about doing the flat up in choosing the furniture for it, because… becasue everything had to be new. And that was all fun, it was like I was all ready for the start of my life, my new life. And now as like I’m just waiting for my new life to happen, I don’t really meet anyone, I don’t really know anyone except the people at work. And I’m just waiting. 

00:15:20
Well, I just haven’t been able to get up this week um… I know I should have gone back to work but I just, I just stayed in bed thought what’s the use you know that I won’t be(ph) and I felt so low and really I haven’t felt like doing anything and you know I just keep thinking what’s the point, what’s the point. Um… it’s never going to get me any better um… you know I’m, I can’t do my job, my marriage is failed and kids don’t live with me anymore. You know, I’m a failure you know what… what is the point? 

00:16:10
[sil.] 

00:16:15
Yeah so, um… well I’ve recently I had this bad sporting injury and I did play a lot of… a lot of sport and it’s made me realized that I’m… I’m… I'm not really very happy with my, my job or my ah… my personal relationships really and I… I don’t know quite what to do to… to… do now, I’m not able to… to carry out the sport inside of my life, it was a big part of it, I spend most of the week doing it really and now and now I’m just wondering um… where I can get a kind of sense of direction from… 

00:16:50

That you’ve been looking for something which has never been there in the first place. 

00:22:50
SUSAN BERNS (ph) Hmm… hmm… It is hard to tell my child that I think because my child is kind of struggled as I’ve, if I grown up to make my mother… 

00:23:05
[sil.] 

00:23:10
MIKE SIMMONS So then they call me in at work and tell me… that then they’re saying a redundant, they’re offering me another, another post, but they don’t expect me to take and the money is no good. 

00:23:25
Alright. 

00:23:25
MIKE SIMMONS So I’m redundant, I get home and Tracey has left with the kids and her mom won’t tell me where she is living. 

00:23:35
Alright. 

00:23:35
MIKE SIMMONS And now two days later the landlord is wanting me out I’m kind of finished, you know. 

00:23:45
Okay, it sounds like that was a really difficult time for you? 

00:23:50
MIKE SIMMONS Oh god yeah, it really is and now… 

00:23:55
[sil.] 

00:24:00
I just couldn’t believe it, I mean is it just so typical of my luck. I was gonna go to Stratford this weekend. 

00:24:05
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:24:05
And I was really-really looking forward to it and I was going to be with old friends and you know, I’d saved up for it and you know look forward to (inaudible ) and then (inaudible ) my daughter gets ill and I’d arrange for her to be looked after by a neighbor. But you know, but an hour before I’m hitching(ph) to go, she goes down with this terrible soar throat and then there was spots all over the place and oh my heart just saying… 

00:24:35
So it’s a shame you couldn’t go. 

00:24:40
Well, I mean I just couldn’t believe it. You know I thought no… no if I pretend she okay, if I just ignore this, this will go away and then I can go, but then I just realized I couldn’t do that, you know I had to look after her, but I mean you know, why does this always happen to me all the time. 

00:24:55
Yeah, so you had to cancel and you had to stay home with her really. 

00:25:00
Yes, I did have to stay with her and I mean you know, I just hoped she didn’t notice how I was feeling, if I feel guilty about it thinking about now, but I… you know I had to bite my tongue on several occasions and I know I was sort of you know just rough handling her into bed and things like that. Just because I was, you now just so… so fed up. 

00:25:25
Hmm…Hmm… made you a bit irritable with her and harder to look after her really. 

00:25:30
Yes, well actually I had to contain myself really and then, you know I had a little chat with myself and said now come home you know pull yourself together it’s just, you know I don’t get out that often. This… this was going to be special and… and when is this going to work out for me. This is what I want to know. 

00:25:50
Hmm… so you’re planning another trip out now? 

00:25:55
I didn't… 

00:26:00
[sil.] 

00:26:05
I’ve been telling you so much about this loss and the pain, I feel… I feel quite overwhelmed. 

00:26:15
Just really there for you when the minute it’s right in front of you and it’s going right through you. 

00:26:20
Yeah it’s, it’s overwhelming me and I just feel I’m frighten and sad. 

00:26:25
Hmm… hmm… frightened and sad. 

00:26:30
Yeah, both feeling fearful and angry, frightened and sad. 

00:26:40
Hmm…Hmm… there is anger in that too? 

00:26:45
Yeah and it’s… 

00:26:45
Pretty overwhelmed with a mix of emotions and it’s hard for you to know, what you’re feeling and where you are going with it. 

00:26:55
Yes, I do I feel really overwhelmed, and it’s really frightening I want to… I want to feel it but I, it is horrible. 

00:27:05
[sil.] 

00:27:25
Being a "Client" 

00:27:30
[sil.] 

00:27:35
Okay (inaudible ), you came here today to talk. 

00:27:36
Hmm… 

00:27:36
Would you like to start? 

00:27:40
Well, I think there is a lots of things I’d like to um… I’m not very sure how best as it to put across where, where it’s going on. But I’m ah… basically my problem is that I play or have always played quite a lot of sport. 

00:27:55
Right. 

00:27:55
And just recently I’ve had a couple of major kind of injuries which have meant that basically I can’t really do what I used to be able to do. 

00:28:00
Right. 

00:28:05
And… and basically as a sort of some problem with my ligaments and things which basically means that I can’t really, I used to play just sort of to squash and play football and other things. And I, basically I’m very limited now I can run bit but not really. And then I think what I’ve gradually realized is that I don’t really have much of a I’ve kind of lost my weigh a bit since I’m unable to do these things, I think I was relying very heavily on that side of my life… 

00:28:30
Right. 

00:28:30
…and then, since I’ve been able to do I’ve… I’ve felt very I’m sort of de-motivated and I can’t really, um… I can’t really get very excited about anything or you know… 

00:28:45
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:28:45
…or find in myself to… to, I have feel like I’ve lost my direction quite a lot. 

00:28:45
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:28:50
And then I’m, I’m not you know I… I've been to have been feeling suicide or anything but I’ve been wondering about you know my friends are joking the other day trying to joy, I can’t really did much, but you know wondering what it would be like I just threw, threw myself into and rest a bit I mean, I wouldn’t say that… that’s a serious… 

00:29:05
Sure. 

00:29:10
…thing, but I’m feeling very kind of um… little bit lost really. 

00:29:15
Hmm… so you’ve gone from being suddenly active. 

00:29:15
Hmm… 

00:29:15
Or very active rather to suddenly not to being able to very active any more… 

00:29:20
Hmm… that’s it. 

00:29:20
…it’s… it’s quite a big loss. 

00:29:25
I will say that I think the other, I mean… I don’t really know, but (inaudible ) take on it really but that, I think the other thing which always becoming clear to me is that a lot my, my social life or, or my although the opportunities I had to sort of make relationships with other people was all coming from that side of my life as well… 

00:29:45
Right, right. 

00:29:50
… working, I sort of have a fairly solitary desk job, but I don’t really have much interaction with people. And I was basically doing that through sort of sporting active where I mean, you know you have a clear purpose if you’re playing a game or whatever. 

00:30:00
Yeah. 

00:30:00
You know it’s all there for you. 

00:30:05
Yeah, go ahead. 

00:30:05
And everybody kind of you don’t need to, you don’t really need great personal skills, it’s just kind of all you know… 

00:30:10
Right. 

00:30:10
…there when the play and you can sort of interact with people in the way that you do, when you do that stuff and I found it without that kind of focus I haven’t got um… I’ve just, I feel a bit like other teenagers wondering how it is that you actually have to go and meet people and talk to them… 

00:30:25
Right. 

00:30:25
…because I’d never really had to try you know it just open there and that kind of reason. 

00:30:30
Yes. 

00:30:30
…and ah, you feel a bit beside hang alone, if you hang out with your old mates that you used to do the sport stuff with, because obviously they’ll start doing it and you are no kind of… 

00:30:40
Right so it’s kind of… 

00:30:40
…thing and if you like you know in treating a bit. 

00:30:45
Well, I guess yes it must be like salt in the wounds for that. 

00:30:45
Yeah… yeah. I don’t, I was like I said I don’t think I’ve really realized until it, till I lost it how much of my life was build around then I was you know, my job is not (inaudible ) exciting and I think a lot what I was… was keeping me going, it was the next… 

00:31:05
Right. 

00:31:05
…you know the next game or the next then I would have a chance to meet off and discuss the stuff(ph), whatever you know without that I’m just… like I say I think it’s a direction thing, I’m just, I’m certainly wondering where it is that my life is actually going… 

00:31:15
Alright and you’ve been feeling really quite depressed. 

00:31:20
Yeah, I mean I was just felt empty I think it's the best way and bit like everything is a bit kind of meaningless I suppose. 

00:31:25
Yes. 

00:31:25
You know I’m not… not quite sure about the point getting up in the morning and some days you know ah… like I said my… the, the work sort of thing and that… isn’t that inspiring and the I think, I just have to realize how little kind of a, sort of a friendships I had outside of the… the sport side of things, but it's now I kind of lost that I just don’t really um… feel very connected up with the other people. 

00:31:55
It’s… it’s really kind of provided everything for you, hasn’t it? 

00:31:55
Yeah, I think in a way, if I’m honest about it, I think in a way it probably wasn’t that health, the way I was before, but just because I was so relying on that but it’s not really ah… that’s you know I realized that not, because it doesn’t make any easier to find anything as to replace it with. 

00:32:15
Right you may have sort of somehow taking it for granted that’s it. 

00:32:15
Yeah that… that’s it, yeah. 

00:32:20
Gave your goals and your social… 

00:32:20
That's it. 

00:32:20
…satisfaction and stimulation and general health and fitness I guess and suddenly all that has been taken away. 

00:32:30
Yeah. 

00:32:30
That must feel a real kind of shock. 

00:32:30
Yeah, I think also, yeah I think I’m you know just physically if your active, you get, I used to get a kind of both of that. 

00:32:35
Right. 

00:32:40
And ah… not being able to, I can’t really find a substitute that gives me the same kind of… you get a kind of accelerating kind of feeling of you know. And then you get extra energy of doing the stuff like that and I’m again taking on the surface just doesn’t as we seem to just make me feel kind of lethargy and kind of a bit this lesson stuff. And I think the so it’s part a physical things.

Demonstration of Practice session 1 

00:33:20
So what does it you want to talk about today? 

00:33:25
Well it’s… it’s a real dilemma that I have um… and I’m really pulled between the two um… I had an email… 

00:33:35
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:33:40
…ah last week. And it was from a friend in New Zealand we, we were kids together. And really close we’ve kept the friendship up all through college and you know nearly early 20’s and then she moved with her partner. And we’ve hardly seen other, I mean we keep, we keep in touch we used to write you know email. So we kept it going like that, but she is on her way ah… over to New York and it’s thinking of stopping off for three days and there was a chance for us to meet. 

00:34:20
Alright. 

00:34:20
And this is the first time and long-long time. And I really want to do it and then I had a… a phone call from my mom ah… a couples of days ago she was coming down needs to talk about family business. And it’s on the days that my friend is coming. And oh… I’m really in a picktle(ph), because if turn my mom down she would go on and on… and on. 

00:34:55
Sounds like you’re really toward(ph) between what you really want to do and what you feel would be perhaps the wisest thing to do… 

00:35:00
Oh, yes, yes. Yeah. And… I mean, I as, oh I felt into it straight away… you know when my mom came and just a kind to come down, I said fine you know as I usually do and then she said the dates and as I said fine… 

00:35:25
Right so part of you, it sounds likes you are quite angry with yourself, but having said yes before you’d even taught about whether or not… 

00:35:30
Umm… 

00:35:30
…you really could, or wanted to do that time? 

00:35:35
Yes, yeah. It’s very hard to signal to her umm… when she, you know, when I was, she rings, it feels as if I’m being some and, and… 

00:35:45
Hmm… 

00:35:50
…that’s exactly how it feels now at home… 

00:35:50
Yes, it’s just like as part of your relationship and the way your relationships always been there when she asks you to do something it’s really difficult for you to. 

00:36:00
Yes. Yes. 

00:36:00
I know, it’s all. 

00:36:05
Yeah, I just jump… 

00:36:05
You jump… 

00:36:05
…you know I think I jump in, in the practical sense also yes, of course… 

00:36:10
Yeah. 

00:36:10
…and I jump back to being a kid again. And… 

00:36:20
Feels like you’re responding as if you were kind of the obedient child? 

00:36:25
Yes. 

00:36:25
Yeah. 

00:36:25
Yes. Umm… if she comes that’s how it will be umm… it’s like the whole, because she will bring her two dogs. So, it just like the (inaudible ) and everything at home will have to, to change in order to take my cats into the cat tree, because she won’t put her dogs in, into the… into the kennels. 

00:36:45
Yeah. 

00:36:50
And she pontificate again… 

00:36:50
Yeah. 

00:36:55
I don’t know what it’s about, but family business, umm… it will be something that she’s crumbling about my, about my brother or my sister, you know. 

00:37:05
And I feels like you don’t think that that something you want to give up the time with a friend… 

00:37:15
No… 

00:37:15
…to, to be with… 

00:37:15
No, I don’t not at all, not at all, I mean when Kathy emailed and said, she was coming, I thought oh, this is absolutely wonderful. 

00:37:25
Umm…Hmm… 

00:37:25
…and began to plan and, and to think about where we could go, I mean she’d stayed with us. So, we could help you know all our time together, because she is coming on her own. 

00:37:35
Umm…Hmm… 

00:37:40
And Jack wouldn’t mind, I mean he would find stuff to do. Oh, and we just have fun again not just emailing and you know something it just as photograph there is so much to catch upon, because we were so close. I mean she lived on the street and, and then when, I don’t know how that happened, but her mom and my mom were really close friends. But, we went to the same school and you know, right the way through the sixth form, went to different colleges, but we still saw each other, you know and we are always there for each other. 

00:38:25
She has been a really major scoop for you… 

00:38:25
Oh… 

00:38:25
…even when you are happy and saying… 

00:38:25
…yes, yes, yes. Yeah, and she is a sort of person you can tell stuff to… 

00:38:35
Umm…Hmm… 

00:38:35
…you know, no matter what’s happened to me, she hasn’t jumped on me or criticize in anyway. She just seems to… 

00:38:45
Umm…Hmm… 

00:38:45
…to understand, you know she is a constant if you like. 

00:38:50
Yeah, and it sounds like you will kind of making a bit of a comparison between what it would be like if you see Kathy and what… 

00:38:55
Oh yes. 

00:38:55
…it would be like if you want to say(ph), because the contrast is so great here. 

00:39:00
Yeah, one would be a delight and one would be just plain(ph) day. 

00:39:05
Umm…Hmm… 

00:39:05
I like just done know what to do… 

00:39:05
Umm…Hmm… 

00:39:10
…I just don’t know what to do. I know what she’d have, enough courage to say to my mother, don’t come or you know can we delay it if I do and then it oh, that’ll be (inaudible ) again. We’ll have try it to. 

00:39:25
Get shrink? 

00:39:30
Yeah, in the past. 

00:39:30
Umm…Hmm… 

00:39:30
You know, just to say well, don’t come but she more or less comes anyway. 

00:39:35
Hmm… it sounds like you feel already powerless with your mother sometimes? 

00:39:40
Yeah, I think that’s, that’s a pretty good word. She just takes over… 

00:39:45
Umm… 

00:39:45
…you know she will come in and, and she will, I see her looking around. I will be cleaning. I’ll be cleaning for a week… 

00:39:55
Umm…Hmm… 

00:39:55
…just so that she won’t, I mean if she was a sergeant major she would come with a white gloves you know… 

00:40:00
Yeah and bit, and a bit of you really resents that? 

00:40:05
Oh, yes. 

00:40:05
And as angry with yourself for go along with it really… 

00:40:10
Yes. 

00:40:10
…allowing it to happen. 

00:40:10
Yes and I don’t know what is greater me resenting it or just few feeling angry with myself… 

00:40:15
Umm…Hmm… 

00:40:20
…you know for, for complying. 

00:40:20
Umm… 

00:40:25
And just is what’s the first just to tell her as if you don’t know, you know, I mean she is this nicest pie with him all she has got to do is make a couple of pies and he is like partying(ph) her hands, you know, that she is, I was a good to other people. 

00:40:40
Umm… something about the relationship with you and her… 

00:40:45
Uhm… 

00:40:50
…that takes you back to being the child who comes in there? 

00:40:55
Yes, yeah. Yeah, whatever I wanted to do as a child and because I was the oldest and suppose, she thought I should be responsible for her, for my brother and sisters… 

00:41:10
Umm…Hmm… 

00:41:10
…but… oh, it just carried on you know, and Kathy was the one that I could talk about, about the two you know, we could have a bit of laugh and then she sort of make light of it and I could… I could bear it. 

00:41:35
It’s almost like a rerunning of that, that battle in your childhood that’s happening now with the two aspects of your childhood facing you once. 

00:41:40
Yes. 

00:41:45
Having to make a choice? 

00:41:45
Yeah, I can’t like Kathy telling them, it might be a long-long time before I see her again. I just got to get my nerve up to say, to say to mom, no, you cannot, no you can’t come but you have to come on another day. 

00:42:05
Umm…Hmm… Umm…Hmm… 

00:42:10
And then she want to know why. 

00:42:10
What, what would you want to say to her then? 

00:42:15
I’d want to say, this is really important for me that I see Kathy… 

00:42:20
Umm…Hmm… 

00:42:20
…that I, I fairly rarely see her. 

00:42:25
Hmm… 

00:42:25
I see my mother at least once a month… 

00:42:25
Umm…Hmm… 

00:42:30
…umm… I’m surely she can give a couple of days leave(ph) you know… 

00:42:35
Umm…Hmm… 

00:42:40
…I either do that, or I’ll lie. I pretend you know I’ve got a hospital appointment or something like that. 

00:42:50
It feels so scary telling your mother that you’d want her to change the day that you almost rather like about… 

00:42:55
Yes, I think, I would, I think I would because if she knew it, it was Kathy that I wanted to see and she’d be really oh, she will be furious ah… 

00:43:10
Kathy would be a particular issue for her? 

00:43:10
Yes. 

00:43:10
Umm… 

00:43:10
Yeah, yes she never quite liked her and may be that’s why I love Kathy you know, because she was, you know some way I was oh, just tell my mother off or you know without actually get angry or telling my mother the truth, I could just go and tell it to Kathy you know… 

00:43:35
It’s kind of a safe way rebelling… 

00:43:35
Yes, yes. 

00:43:35
…and, and fighting off… 

00:43:40
Yes, and I think my mom new… 

00:43:40
Hmm… 

00:43:40
…you know, and I, I can remember bringing home Kathy one day and… 

00:43:50
[sil.] 

00:44:05
Demonstration of Practice session 2 

00:44:10
So what would you like to talk about? 

00:44:15
It’s about how things are at work really umm… I’ve been working for the company that I’m with for about eight years, I think it is and it just feels like, I’m not going anywhere with them, I don’t know what it is. But, it seems that whenever I apply for promotion and I’ve applied three times now umm… it just, just feels like I getting out back automatically and I, I don’t know what the problem is. 

00:44:50
Umm…Hmm… 

00:44:50
I don’t know what it is that they’ve got against me? 

00:44:50
Umm…Hmm… 

00:44:55
Umm… I’m a kind of bit worried about it, I mean it makes just be, they don’t want a woman in management position. I don’t know or may be it’s just that… I’m not good enough. And sometimes I think it's the one and sometimes I think it's the other and I don’t seem to be able to nowhere to go with it really. 

00:45:15
Sounds like you are a bit puzzled about what’s happening to your work and… and respect to your, your bosses, what, what they might be thinking or? 

00:45:25
And what they think about me as part of it and I mean I don’t know have they got something against me or what it really then, I don’t really think on that in competent actually I think I could do the job. 

00:45:35
Just a bit of you says yes, I could do it, but there is a part that questions, perhaps not… 

00:45:45
Well, there was also a bit of me thinking perhaps I’m just being kind of arrogant. Perhaps, they do know better perhaps, the person they, they appointed actually does no better than me and could do the better job, may be there is something more about the job that I don’t understand I mean… 

00:46:00
So perhaps that bit is a bit bigger, that’s you think is a bit more of your thinking that you might not be up to it. 

00:46:10
It comes and goes really. There are days when I’m absolutely shill that they just putting me down and there are days when my whole confident is low or may be I’ve made a mistake or something and I think now it’s just, it is just that something they want that I, I haven’t got, but may be I’ve reached my limit may be I’ve reached the top of the trees as far as I’m concerned and I don’t want to be one of those people who’s been, who’s been umm… you know promoted to one step above the job they can do and you know how often you say oh well, in some sense I guess promoted they get promoted until they get the job they can’t do properly and I don’t want that, that to happen to me. 

00:47:00
And you sound so unsure about them, it seesawing from one to the other. 

00:47:05
Almost on the daily basis, sometimes even, even on an hourly basis, I, I can’t decide which it is… 

00:47:10
Umm…Hmm… 

00:47:10
…and I brewed on it. 

00:47:15
So it’s in your mind constantly that. 

00:47:15
Yeah, yeah I think about it when I’m on the train to work and I think about it when I’m at work, I think about it if I’m in coffee break and it’s fun if I’m with the others and which acting and kind of I like that companionable bit. And… you know the kind of, the kind of place that I work in is, is a big office and there is lots of us doing similar source of task you know that, we are on the computers we’re, we’re handling a lot of paperwork but, it can be quite a fun with you know a lot of us in the room in which laughing and joking and I can be part of the crowd then. That’s fine. 

00:47:50
Umm…Hmm… 

00:47:55
And I don’t think about it then, but sometimes if the umm… the manager makes a decision I’m not happy with or if umm… if I think well, I’ve actually got a better idea than that or if I just think, you know why is it that all the managers are men, then I, I begin think well, they talk a lot about the quality, I’m like all big private companies now they’ve got these policies, but I don’t know that they do it really, I don’t think they they act it out. 

00:48:30
So it sounds like that that you might be questioning their stance and you said that is it about equality… 

00:48:35
Umm… 

00:48:40
I wonder if that’s playing around a bit more for you? 

00:48:40
Well, that’s always kind of the question at the back of my mind I suppose. 

00:48:45
Perhaps that you keep on coming back to? 

00:48:50
Yes. Yes, I think although it just assuming I can’t do it. 

00:48:55
Umm… 

00:49:00
They are not prepared to even consider it may be it would, maybe yesterday I worry if they, the thing I couldn’t do it or may be if they think it would spoil the fun to have the group if they had a woman in there with them as well, because it wouldn’t be the same. 

00:49:15
Right. 

00:49:15
And I think it wouldn’t be that stupid(ph) with thing. 

00:49:20
So, you think that they might be feeling quite fearful of you in a different position, if you moving out from where you are now and rather threatening them? 

00:49:30
I didn’t thought of it quite like that, but I guess fearful yes, it could be that… they wouldn’t want the way things would be that they are aware that it would be, just be, be different. It would change the dynamics of how they would operate and would I fit in with the, the group of managers going down to the pub on a Friday or would, they couldn’t leave me to go out you know, to, to, to join the, the ordinary workers that wouldn’t work well. I couldn’t do that. So, they wouldn’t know what to do with me because I won’t… 

00:50:10
Umm…Hmm… 

00:50:10
…won’t be the same if I went with them. 

00:50:10
But I heard you say when you are in with the crowd you’re uncomfortable… 

00:50:15
I’m fine with the… you know with the women I work with… 

00:50:20
Yeah. 

00:50:20
…and that’s never a problem. But it’s always, I suppose there is this bit of kind of them and ask and if I were to go up. And I would be the one who is the most suited to go up, I’ve been the longest and I’ve… I’m the one who have learned… 

00:50:35
Umm…Hmm… 

00:50:35
…comes to when they need… 

00:50:35
Umm…Hmm… 

00:50:35
…to know something, I’m the one… 

00:50:35
Umm…Hmm… 

00:50:40
…who kind to knows all the tricks and the ways around and who is the person in such and such a department who will understand about this. 

00:50:45
So you really have a lot of experience? 

00:50:45
I do, I’ve got a lot of experience and I’m… I can do the job I do really well. I know I can. 

00:50:55
You are confident? 

00:50:55
Sometimes, sometimes, yes. I know that I’m good at what I do. 

00:51:05
But when you start thinking about what your bosses might be thinking… 

00:51:10
Umm…Hmm… 

00:51:10
…that’s when you seem to become vulnerable. So there is the seesaw in the game the, the confidence of what you know you’re doing… 

00:51:20
Yes. 

00:51:20
…but when you think about what other people think that’s when it seems to bring it down. 

00:51:25
And I think it’s something about it’s not just, would I be able to do it. Though I mean I do, you know obviously I have that part(ph), I’ve been doing this job for years, I don’t know what it will be like if I go on and, and do something different, but also that what would it like to be, be like to be part of a group who didn’t really want me, then and I, I’d really miss being one of the girls being passionate… 

00:51:50
Umm…Hmm… 

00:51:50
…the group and being kind of a person who knows oh, I might go to being somebody who wasn’t really want to there, who is bit of an outsider. 

00:52:00
I’m look periphery. 

00:52:00
I’ll be on the periphery, I’ll be the new one… 

00:52:00
Umm…Hmm… 

00:52:05
…yeah and I think that’s, that’s partly what scares me, it's that thought that ah… I didn’t really thought of this is not just kind I do it, but actually would it spoil the bits I do like about work now… 

00:52:20
Right. 

00:52:25
…and, yeah not wanting to be, not wanted that. 

00:52:30
Umm…Hmm…Umm… and having to go through that, I guess to find out… 

00:52:35
Yes. 

00:52:40
…if thought was the case. 

00:52:40
Yes, that’s right. I’ll never know unless I do it. 

00:52:40
Umm…Hmm… Umm…Hmm… but from this stance it feels quite scary and uncomfortable. 

00:52:50
It feels scary if I got the promotion and it’s very painful to keep being knocked back and told I’m not good enough and it feels like it will be so much easier just to say well I’m good to what I’m doing let’s just stay where I am. 

00:53:05
Safer? 

00:53:10
Much safer. But why should they get away with that? 

00:53:15
Umm…Hmm… 

00:53:15
Why should they? 

00:53:20
That sounded quite of a challenging ring to it, why should they. 

00:53:25
I don’t know… yes exactly, exactly. I can’t believe this is happening in the 21st century you know, and that’s the bit, that’s when I begin to down, I think with, this can’t be happening. They can’t be there… yes they can’t… 

00:53:40
Can’t be happening to you? 

00:53:45
It can’t be happening to me, yes shortly we’ve moved on from this and that’s when I start to doubt and it must just be me, may be I’m just not good enough and I just making up all the story, but… 

00:53:55
Umm…Hmm… so this sounds as if its also challenge or some deeply held beliefs of yours as well. 

00:54:05
Oh absolutely. 

00:54:05
Umm…Hmm… 

00:54:05
Absolutely the sense of fairness you know, it’s, it’s against all the principles of fairness. If I’m good enough, I ought to be able to have a chance. 

00:54:20

Demonstration of Practice session 3 

00:54:45
Okay, good. You’ve come to see me. And you want to and tell me what’s the matter. 

00:54:55
Well, umm… ah… I don’t know the, the best way to explain it, but, I, I’ve, I’ve been doing a lot of, of all my life, I have done a lot of sporting activity it’s been a big part to my life… 

00:55:05
Well, what kind of sports? 

00:55:10
Umm… I’ve… well, a lot of ah… some teams sports and also… 

00:55:15
Umm…Hmm… 

00:55:15
…a lot squash and things like that, racket(ph) sports as well… 

00:55:15
Umm…Hmm… 

00:55:15
…and it’s very… 

00:55:20
Well in health club or, or umm… 

00:55:20
Yeah. 

00:55:20
…or just sort of a local team like? 

00:55:25
Well, that well quite serious I mean that I’ve, I’ve, I’ve depending on what it is I’ve always played for teams and you know quite a serious basis and then organized… 

00:55:30
Right. 

00:55:30
…a sort of, yeah. 

00:55:30
Right seriously you want (inaudible ) me professionally? 

00:55:35
Umm… no, I’ve never been that far and as never been to create, ever since of this at school I’ve always wanted to make a big part of my life. So I, I’ve, I’ve been in a football team and a hockey team for the… 

00:55:45
Right. 

00:55:45
…you know ever since… 

00:55:45
Right. 

00:55:45
…then… 

00:55:50
Why was that then why didn’t you want to make a serious part of your life now? 

00:55:50
Well, I think I have described, I was good at it… 

00:55:55
And made you feel good sort of thing, yeah? 

00:55:55
Yeah, yeah. 

00:55:55
Yeah. 

00:56:00
Yeah, I was encouraged when I was at school too. 

00:56:00
Okay. 

00:56:00
Just sort of pursue if any umm… and that what, what happened recently is that, I’ve, I’ve, I basically just had a serious of quite major injuries that meant that can’t really carry on… 

00:56:15
I mean that’s… 

00:56:15
…a still(ph) quite, you know… 

00:56:15
Yeah, I’m sorry to hear that. 

00:56:15
…quite certainly, yeah. 

00:56:15
What sort of injuries? 

00:56:20
Well, basically I’ve got a problem with the, the ligaments in my knee… 

00:56:20
Right. 

00:56:20
…and I think because it’s over compensing(ph) a bit I then, I’ve, I’ve done my achilles tendon in my right ankle… 

00:56:30
Oh, right. Right. 

00:56:30
…when these things are serious, you, you know, that that, that’s basically it for me. 

00:56:35
Right. 

00:56:35
Now I can’t, I can’t really… 

00:56:35
Right, right. 

00:56:35
…return to, to a sort of physique, how it physical connectivity I don’t… 

00:56:40
Yeah, gosh, gosh. 

00:56:40
So, I feel umm… I feel that I, I just not quite sure how you know it was a such big problem in my life, I’m not quite sure how I can replace it really… 

00:56:50
Yeah. 

00:56:55
…I, I feel, I feel quite lost about umm… about what to feel the whole with now I’m, I’m not really ah… 

00:57:00
What, what have you tried out? What if you… 

00:57:05
…well, I, I just haven’t really been able to think of anything. It was such a big you know, several nights a week, I was doing that. 

00:57:10
Umm…Hmm… 

00:57:10
And I haven’t really been able to think of… 

00:57:15
Right. 

00:57:15
…anything to replace it with, I mean, I, I just feel a bit kind of blank about the whole thing really. 

00:57:20
Right, it sounds like you might have been doing it a bit as well that all of these nights a week. 

00:57:25
Well it was, I didn’t feel like that when I was doing it, it felt you know, I got a real buzz(ph) of doing it. In fact it was umm… 

00:57:35
No I was just thinking with the injuries and everything. 

00:57:35
Well, I mean, I that with… 

00:57:40
Perhaps if you’d taken a bit easier. 

00:57:40
Well, different sports give you different, I mean I, I didn’t feel you know, I was always very careful about, I mean as that that with in both cases it was just accidents that happened in the, in the field. You know, so these things kinda happen, I didn’t really feel like umm… you know there is, there is just a part of, part of life really when you do that stuff. But, umm… I just, I, I, I, I’ve been really conscious since then, I don’t feel like I’ve got anything to replace this stuff… 

00:58:10
You’re right. 

00:58:10
…and, and, and, and I was getting a real buzz out of it. 

00:58:10
Umm… 

00:58:15
And I, I feel really kinda listless and kind of ah… without bit much direction then I found really that… 

00:58:20
So how many years altogether were you playing the sports you know, how do you know and sort of… 

00:58:25
Well, probably well I’m in mid 30s now… 

00:58:30
Right. 

00:58:30
…early teens, over 20 years… 

00:58:30
Right, right. 

00:58:30
Yeah. 

00:58:30
Yes, so long time then yeah. 

00:58:30
Umm… 

00:58:35
Yeah. 

00:58:35
Umm… 

00:58:35
But sorry you were saying did you, did you try, have you tried other kinds of you know there are sort of other games that you can be competitive about without having to move somethings… 

00:58:45
I don’t think. I just I think, it was the physical activity that was the main purpose of it for me that I think umm… you know without, without that you know I can’t imagine any other sort of game which didn’t involve you know, strength your physical activity… 

00:59:00
Umm…Hmm… 

00:59:00
…that would have the same… 

00:59:00
Umm… 

00:59:05
…kind of affects for me. 

00:59:05
Umm… 

00:59:05
So now, I haven’t… 

00:59:05
Right. 

00:59:10
…really managed. 

00:59:10
So it’s hard to be realistic about what you can do now really. 

00:59:15
Yeah, I suppose, I suppose that might be… 

00:59:15
Umm…Hmm… 

00:59:20
…that might be, I don’t really have umm… I don’t really have ah… like I say I just don’t have a sense of what I could replace, replace all that stuff with I mean it was a lot of you know, weak you know. 

00:59:30
Umm…Hmm… Umm…Hmm… yeah, it does sound, it does sound like a big change for you. 

00:59:35
Umm… 

00:59:40
Yeah, it does sound big change, yeah. How are you feeling about that? 

00:59:45
Well, I just umm… like I say I mean ah… ah… in, in, in a way I don’t feel that much, I just feel very empty about it all really, I have to, I have… that’s one of the, the problems that I feel like I have that I can’t really, I can’t really work out what I feel about it… 

01:00:05
Yeah. 

01:00:05
…actually apart from the big kind of empty… 

01:00:05
Yeah. 

01:00:05
…space really a big…big loss. 

01:00:10
Yeah… yeah… yeah, I remember when I am ah… you know stopped playing games and that was, you know I quite enjoyed I’ve played a lot of team games and um… when I look back now I don’t really know why I stopped actually. But I do sort of thing to myself, you know and I'd like to you know wish I haven’t so… so I'm, I know what you mean, you know I am miss it too. 

01:00:35
Um…Hmm… Well I think, I don’t like ah… what it… what it’s made me realize is that I think that I, I didn’t really ah… invest much in my life outside of that you know… 

01:00:50
Right. 

01:00:55
…I kind of, I can kind of see that… that I wasn’t really, I was so focused on all that side of things. 

01:01:00
Yeah. 

01:01:00
I never really you know, I don’t have ah… ah… many strong personal relationships that all you know… 

01:01:05
Right are you in a relation, no? 

01:01:05
…no I'm… I'm and I… I never… I never… 

01:01:10
Oh… any other friends than outside sport or anything? 

01:01:10
Well I think most of the people I was in contact with was all through that side of things, you know it gave me a real kind of a, it was kind of very easy to me pick up that way and, and… and I've just felt very home in that kind of environment. 

01:01:25
Hmm… 

01:01:25
You know and ah… without that I… I'm really struggling to think about how I could actually connect up with people you know. 

01:01:30
What about your family any brothers and sisters? 

01:01:35
And they… I have them but they live at you know, I'm from up north and they live, sort of I mean we're on friendly terms, but we don’t see much each other… 

01:01:45
Um… 

01:01:45
…may be Christmas you know. 

01:01:45
Um… so it sounds quite lonely then really. 

01:01:50
Yeah… yeah, I think that’s what ah… 

01:01:50
Um… 

01:01:50
It's kind of, I'm just coming to realize that I… I didn’t really have much of you know life… 

01:01:55
Um…um… 

01:02:00
…that much of a life outside that… that sort of stuff… 

01:02:00
Bit unbalanced really. 

01:02:00
…and I don’t know how to go back to… 

01:02:05
Really? 

01:02:05
…you know building on family relationships or… 

01:02:05
Yeah. 

01:02:05
…finding other new people to me actually. 

01:02:10
Yeah… Yeah… 

01:02:10
Yeah. 

01:02:10
Did you say you worked? Sorry I missed that? 

01:02:15
Yeah, I do… I do… 

01:02:15
Yeah. 

01:02:15
I am not particularly I mean it’s a fairly kind of dull job really… 

01:02:20
Uh…huh… 

01:02:20
…and it’s, it’s okay but it’s never been a, a big kind of ah… highlight in my life really. 

01:02:25
No I was just thinking that it might offer you some social and possibilities you know. 

01:02:30
I… I don’t really work in… I don't really come into contact them and it must be (inaudible ) really just sort of pushing information. 

01:02:36
Alright. 

01:02:36
You know, and I don’t really ah… I don’t really interact that much with people during my working… 

01:02:40
Right. 

01:02:45
…day and… 

01:02:45
Do you like your job? Then did you say not really very much… 

01:02:45
No… no… no I don’t …it’s okay, I mean I’ve got I've been in it for years, I can sort of do without much effort that but it’s not… I don’t find it stimulating or… 

01:02:55
Right… right. 

01:03:00
It's in fact the… I suppose the reason why I like it is the I can just kind of do it. 

01:03:05
Hmm… 

01:03:05
An autopilot without having to think too much in a way. 

01:03:10
Right so really need to find something that stimulates you know, because you lost the sport and work hasn’t up to much. 

01:03:15
Yeah, yeah I think that… I think that probably is what I need, but I'm… 

01:03:20
Hmm… 

01:03:20
…it's… I mean the problem that I'm having is just thinking about well that could possibly be because whatever I think have just doesn’t seem to you know do the same thing that the… that the, that sport was doing for my son(ph). 

01:03:35
Yeah… yeah well I think I'm… you know sort of you could talk to… to other people and I guess you know still in the sports would you not have friends that who probably like to see you anyway or maybe you get on with whether or not you play the sport, I mean you might not realized that, but you know I am sure… I am sure that that must be the case for some of you teammates. 

01:04:05
I think that… the problem is that all of us had, you know we had our life doing that stuff and… 

01:04:10
Hmm…Hmm… 

01:04:15
…we would all sort of share that, but outside we were… we were actually I think quite private you know we just sort of when we’re about our own business, I think if I tend out now without having a role to play. 

01:04:25
Yeah. 

01:04:30
On the field over that were… 

01:04:30
Yeah. 

01:04:30
…I would just feel a little bit like I was you I've… I've lost my kind of reason to be that in my place there, you know so I will just feel like I was kind of hanging on really. 

01:04:40
Yeah… yeah all I am saying is never say never that, because you never know you know, sometimes you know like I remember when I was at work and you know a good colleague of mine retired and we only have saw each other at work. 

01:04:50
Hmm…Hmm… 

01:04:55
But you know when he retired we… we missed each other and began to see each other socially, you know and that's… that's been really nice. 

01:05:00
Hmm…Hmm… 

01:05:00
You know I never thought that when I was at work, but now… 

01:05:05
Hmm…Hmm… 

01:05:05
…that he has gone and that’s become clear. 

01:05:10

01:05:25
Demonstration of Practice session 4 

01:05:35
MIKE SIMMONS Hello Norma what you'd like to talk about? 

01:05:45
NORMA JAMES Um… well what I'd like to talk through is um… the project that I’ve been given to do. 

01:05:50
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:05:55
NORMA JAMES And I've got a deadline for end of November and there is no way that I am going to meet that. 

01:06:00
MIKE SIMMONS I was kind of noticing all that tension in your hand it says no way I could meet that… 

01:06:05
NORMA JAMES Yes, I'm feeling. 

01:06:10
MIKE SIMMONS …kind of pretty difficult. 

01:06:10
NORMA JAMES Yes, very difficult at the moment. If I had you know other workers alongside me who were fitting in with what I I wanted to do instead of messing around then I probably could you know, get the job done, but no matter how I ask them ah… you know appeal to that better nature or whatever they're just not… they're just ignoring me, just doing what they want to do. 

01:06:45
MIKE SIMMONS So it sounds like you're saying you can’t get it done, because as the people won’t cooperate. 

01:06:50
NORMA JAMES Oh yeah. 

01:06:50
MIKE SIMMONS And there is… there is nothing you can do about it. 

01:06:55
NORMA JAMES Absolutely nothing at all no, no I've tried everything, I've tried and… and I'm really up against that I’ve got so much work on. You know, I was given this project and I knew that I was full of working and you know that that’s my line manager. And… and I didn’t want to do, and I told them right from the start, I said you know this is very small amount of time that you’ve given me to do this. And they said well, you know you've… you've got the other workers get them involved. 

01:07:30
MIKE SIMMONS But it sounds like you're saying you can’t get them involved. 

01:07:35
NORMA JAMES No… no I’ve tried, I’ve really tried. And… and they just did they… they just ignore me, they've got their ideas about what they want to do and I think I am in the middle of politics here. That’s what I think is… is happening and… Hmm. 

01:07:55
MIKE SIMMONS It's like you sound like you feel quite hopeless. 

01:08:05
NORMA JAMES Hmm… yeah… yeah I think that’s, that’s a pretty good description of it, because I’ve, I’ve just, I can’t see without their cooperation how I can get this work done and it will go against me. It won’t be you know, because I'm… I’m in-charge of this so it, it won’t be a black mark against them. 

01:08:30
MIKE SIMMONS It will be you that takes the blame. 

01:08:30
NORMA JAMES Oh, yeah… yeah. 

01:08:35
MIKE SIMMONS And because you can’t get them to do what you need them to do. 

01:08:40
NORMA JAMES Hmm… yeah… yeah. 

01:08:45
MIKE SIMMONS And you look really kind of drown what you think about it? Kind of face look sad and… 

01:08:55
NORMA JAMES Yeah, very stressed at the moment very stressed um… I’m working overtime, working weekends, trying to get through things and you know, I'm… I've got to after college to this other courses as well. So how I'm expected to, to fit in everything. I will be responsible for the others to, to come on board, I just don’t know. I… I… I… 

01:09:30
MIKE SIMMONS It’s like you're squeezed in the middle, because it sounds like management are excepting you to do something. And you're expecting those co-workers, are they co-workers or they your team I am not quite clear. 

01:09:45
NORMA JAMES Um… well, it’s my so called team. 

01:09:50
MIKE SIMMONS But some you've not been able to tell them into your team? 

01:09:55
NORMA JAMES No… no they used to be okay. And… but I think it was something about me being you know put at the head of this project they didn’t quite like that. 

01:10:10
MIKE SIMMONS Right, because you know it's very thoughtful then when you said it used to be okay. 

01:10:15
NORMA JAMES Hmm… 

01:10:15
MIKE SIMMONS I'm wondering whether it was just you getting this project. Or that whether you’re thinking about something else, that’s made things change? 

01:10:30
[sil.] 

01:10:40
NORMA JAMES Yeah… yeah I wasn’t that quite stressed as I am, but it really is sort of and we used to have you know I could handle it then and I could work with them and it feels like I'm working against them now. 

01:11:05
MIKE SIMMONS Okay, let me just take you back, because I was asking you about what had changed. And you’re telling me about how it feels now. And I wonder what happened just in that moment between you and I. 

01:11:25
NORMA JAMES Well, you know on that (inaudible ) too. 

01:11:30
MIKE SIMMONS It feels like I am honored yeah. 

01:11:30
NORMA JAMES Yeah… yeah… Hmm… yeah you certainly, it's like you, you're honored me like everybody else has honored me just to do things and to think of things and to um… come up with answers. 

01:12:00
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… I guess what happened now is that’s left me feeling that you feel attacked by me… 

01:12:10
NORMA JAMES Hmm… 

01:12:15
MIKE SIMMONS Um… and that’s interesting it kind of disempowers me about, it's like you're saying keep back I don’t… I don't want you to go there, I don’t want you to be like um… and I don't of course know where that is, I don't know why you don’t want me to go. 

01:12:35
NORMA JAMES You know that's just what they do it’s gone from… from working with me and that all sort of doing that no, keep back from me. 

01:12:45
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:12:50
[sil.] 

01:13:00
MIKE SIMMONS But I am saying that it feels like you're doing that to me saying keep back. 

01:13:05
[sil.] 

01:13:20
NORMA JAMES Oh, I wonder if that's what they're thinking as well. 

01:13:25
MIKE SIMMONS That you don’t want them to help you. 

01:13:30
NORMA JAMES Yeah… 

01:13:35
[sil.] 

01:13:40
NORMA JAMES Yeah, I guess this part let me think, so I got to do all this on my own anyway. And was from the (inaudible ) missed I mean it… it was said… said you know use the team for this, but somehow its I've taken it all onboard like it was only me that had to do it somehow. 

01:14:05
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, it sounds a bit like using the team would feel like a weakness or a failure on your part. 

01:14:10
NORMA JAMES Hmm… Oh yes. 

01:14:10
MIKE SIMMONS You won’t be able to do everything. 

01:14:10
NORMA JAMES Hmm… 

01:14:15
MIKE SIMMONS And you know it's impossible. 

01:14:15
NORMA JAMES Yeah. 

01:14:15
MIKE SIMMONS And that kind of makes you feel very-very tense. 

01:14:20
NORMA JAMES Yeah. 

01:14:20
MIKE SIMMONS Because it’s an unreasonable task. 

01:14:25
NORMA JAMES Hmm… 

01:14:25
MIKE SIMMONS That you've asked of yourself I guess… 

01:14:30
NORMA JAMES Yes, it’s impossible I can't do it on my own. And it… I feel quite stuck, because I can’t you know, I haven’t been able to ask them. And um… well perhaps I overreacted when they did ask and they sort of said well, yeah we can do it, but we can’t do it right now. 

01:15:00
MIKE SIMMONS So you may be overreacted then? 

01:15:05
NORMA JAMES Hmm… probably. 

01:15:10
[sil.] 

01:15:15
MIKE SIMMONS It looks like there is a lot you're thinking about. 

01:15:20
NORMA JAMES Yeah, like I might have misread all of this. 

01:15:25
[sil.] 

01:15:30
NORMA JAMES I sort of wanted them to do it there and then. You know, and it felt a lot of work to do and they were saying well, we can’t do it now and they couldn’t actually. But then I thought if they don’t do it now, we never going to finish, so I yeah, I said okay, all… all myself which was bit tough. 

01:15:55
MIKE SIMMONS Yes, it sounds like you know bit of a half. 

01:15:55
NORMA JAMES Oh, yeah. 

01:16:00
MIKE SIMMONS (inaudible ). 

01:16:01
NORMA JAMES Hmm… yeah stopped my foot. 

01:16:05
MIKE SIMMONS If you won’t help me now, I'll do it. 

01:16:10
NORMA JAMES Yeah, do it all myself which I couldn’t do it, it was crazy. 

01:16:10
MIKE SIMMONS Hmm…Hmm… 

01:16:15
NORMA JAMES Um… and then stress is just piled on because of that and now I'm too stiff necked and say you know, hey guys I need, I need a bit of help here pretty quick. 

01:16:30
MIKE SIMMONS Is that what you're saying that you are too stiff necked to do it? 

01:16:35
NORMA JAMES Probably, I don’t like saying that. 

01:16:40
MIKE SIMMONS You bit (inaudible ). 

01:16:45
NORMA JAMES Hmm… I’ve said it here. 

01:16:50
MIKE SIMMONS How do you now feel? 

01:16:55
NORMA JAMES Ah… maybe feel a bit embarrassed really. 

01:17:00
MIKE SIMMONS And you look embarrassed. 

01:17:00
NORMA JAMES Yeah, Hmm… 

01:17:05
MIKE SIMMONS That somehow you won’t, not to say I need your help. 

01:17:15
NORMA JAMES Hmm… Hmm… But if I have to pull this out I can’t do it on my own. And I've got to go back to them and just say look I'm very (inaudible ) and I don’t think they’ll you know, I don’t think they’ll turn around and say no. They're a pretty good team really. Well, they’re a very good team actually. 

01:17:45
MIKE SIMMONS So there is kind of little shift going on from I can’t possibly ask them to well maybe I could. 

01:17:55
NORMA JAMES Yeah, it will be dead embarrassing. 

01:18:00
MIKE SIMMONS Oh… and also something about the team from being this really un-cooperative shower. 

01:18:05
NORMA JAMES Hmm…Hmm… 

01:18:05
MIKE SIMMONS To actually you’re in a pretty good team that you’ve got. 

01:18:10
NORMA JAMES Yeah… yeah good to see myself a lot of problems, couldn’t I(ph). Oh, well one more thing to learn okay, well thanks for those, thanks for just help me to think that through.
