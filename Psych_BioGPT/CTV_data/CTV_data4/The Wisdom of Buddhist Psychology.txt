JACK KORNFIELD Hi and welcome. I deliberately let that bell just ring for a while to bring the sense of settling and if we not met before, my name is Jack Kornfield. If we have met before hi again, pleasure. Ah, in this afternoon we have the honor of exploring this ancient and quite remarkable psychology-- Buddhist psychology as a Dalai Lama said Buddhist teachings are not a religion, strictly speaking they are a science in mind and of course, the principles of mindfulness and trainings and compassions, so forth have been study. There's 3,000 papers and studies that had been in the last couple of decades that show both the neuroscience and, ah, ah, various positive benefits from these kinds of trainings, uhm, and together we'll explore this. But first, as we began, I have a few questions for you just to be able to connect and sense with here. How many of you have some established mindfulness or meditative practice? Oh my gosh. All right, how many of you don't? How many of you relatively knew the mindfulness in meditation virgins? Well, it's great. There a few left, excellent. Ah, how many are educators? Thank you first, just thank you for that. So good. Uhm, scientist? Few, wonderful. Uhm, how many are parents? Yehey, look at that, beautiful. Next generation, politicians? Come on. Uhm, how many of you work, ah, considerably with trauma in your practice about half or two-thirds to their real-- okay. So now, I know where we starting. Thank you. Uhm, let me see. This from Thomas Martin. He says, "To allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns to surrender to too many demands, to commit oneself to too many projects to wanna help everyone and everything is itself to see come to the violence of our times." And so, I start with that in some way as an invitation to come back to what serves you as the healers and as the holders of the, uhm, knowing that people that come to you but really of the times in the culture and of humanity and we'll do an overview of some of the principles of Buddhist psychology six or eight or 10 depending how we get through, uhm, tools trainings and quite a bit of experiential work if that's okay. It's not too bad, that's what we're gonna do, uhm, and it's this wild, huge, full, interesting and overwhelming conference, you know, and all these thousands of therapist next to Disneyland, I mean, what more could do. All right, and so, there's also as a need some out of a digester, integrate our next pace, ah. Let's begin this way, uhm, cuz you're already full I suspect. Some people are nodding. Uhm, allow me begin with the one syllable chant and then a few minutes of sitting in silence and the instruction in the sitting in silence is simply to be present and notice what's there body and mind. The syllable is the seed syllable, ah, which in Sanskrit is considered the first and last sound in life but most importantly it's also the seed syllable that represents letting go or opening. And so, I wanna just to sing the sound off, feel it resonate and feel what you wanna let go of right now so that you can actually be where you are here and now. And then, we'll sit with this for a little bit. Ah! Keep it going. Ah! And as you do let go. Ah! And add harmony. Ah-ah-ah. Ah-ah-ah-ah. Ah-ah-ah-ah, keep it going, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, hah, hah.

JACK KORNFIELD Maybe that's enough. I have this drug store birthday card that someone gave me with a cartoon of the Dalai Lama and several monks and, and at present that is open all the wrapping is on the floor. He's looking inside this big box and he says, "Wow! Nothing just what I always wanted." So we start in some way just with the quality of presence and of course, it's not so easy. You sit and say right now I'm gonna be quite and calm and so forth but does your mind listen with things and plans, it has no pride, it will do anything right my friend, Anne Lamott who writes, "My mind is like a bad neighborhood. I try not to go there alone." So, you know, this you have company but when you work with people as you do with, ah, trauma as you raise your hands, there's educators, there's healers and psychologist and therapist of various sorts, you really set in the mystery of our humanity, our shared human incarnation and yes, there are the problems that people bring to you and the tools that you might have to offer them but there's also something bigger which is just to look and say, "Well, are you in there? You know, here we are. How that-- how do you get in this body?" Well, you don't have to say to them. They'll think your weird which you are but, uhm, it's really strange I mean, here you have this body with little patches of fur, some of it disappearing and a whole at one end into which you regularly stuffed dead plants and animals, right. Grind them down through the tube and out the other end and weird protuberances, you know, uhm, and the a vestigial tail, right, and claws that's still remain from your time in the jungle, uhm, ah, it's pretty strange. And, and then, if you don't think that strange enough pay attention when you're making love which is a great thing to do but also really weird. When you look at the, I mean, how we make another person especially little square tube, you know, hear the new person. Hi! I'm here. How do you get in there? Who are you? So you sit with someone, yes to focus and support them in their problems or yourself and then navigating but something bigger. Here's a poem by Lawrence Tirnauer called the Sleepless Ones. "What if all the people who could not sleep at two or three or four in the morning left their houses and went to the parks, what if hundreds, thousands, millions went in solitude like a stream and each told their story, what if there were old woman fearful if they slept they would die and young woman unable to conceive and husbands having affairs and children fearful of failing and fathers worried about paying bills and women having business troubles and man unlucky in love and those that were in physical pain at night and those who were guilty, what if they all left their homes like a stream and the moon illuminated their way and they came each one to tell their stories. Would these be the more troubled of humanity or would these be the more passionate of the world or those who need to create to live or would these be the lonely ones and I ask you if they all came to parks at night and told their stories would the sun on rising be radiant and again I ask you? Would they embrace?" And so, we do a kind of sacred work even though we're not allowed to say that in our clinics or hospitals but the work of the healers and the work of the mentors and the educators in human history has also and the work of the shamans has been a work of reminding people of the sacred because the question is not, ah, so much the future of humanity but the presence on eternity that people consents their connection to meaning and, and life itself. Now, one of the things that's beautiful about Buddhist psychology and its approach is that it has a contemplate of the mantra and that means a couple of things. First, that when I work with people and they come in to see me for that decade and a half or more two decades that I did individual group therapy practice and so forth, I would have people come 10 or 15 minutes early and sit quietly so that when we began they'd sit in outside in a, in a waiting room so that when we began they were present because otherwise you get road noise, they're coming and they just have a little, you know, counter-time on the freeways, somebody cut them off or their boss said something or an e-mail or whatever and that's kind of on the surface but if they sit even for a five or 10 minutes or even if they can't come earlier, I say, "Let's just sit nothing holier, you know, Buddhist about spare your friend and family. Just quite. Let's just sit for a moment and check in," as we just did and then the conversation starts at a different level. It starts from the heart or the body or place that's below the surface so of the day's events. And the other beautiful thing is that so central to the understanding in Buddhist psychology is that what happens between the teacher and the student or the healer and the person, client who comes is only the beginning and most of the work is place in the hands of that person as trainings as in their practices to do, uhm, mindfulness training, compassion training, forgiveness training and so forth, and do them over and over and over again, uhm, so that they become empowered to transform their own inner life and their remain of experience. Uhm, and of course, you know, the modern neuroscience research, I'll just name a few things, uhm, because you're all pretty familiar with neuroplasticity but even after eight weeks Richard Davidson in his lab shows left shifts which allow approaches to challenges, uhm, rather-- more increased capacity for approaches to challenges through this eight weeks of training of mindfulness versus, uhm, avoidance. Uhm, there is physical benefits if you improve immune function, increasing a length of telomeres, there's, uhm, research on, e-- in telomerase that's tiny Jacob's work. There is, ah, CLSR at Harvard and use CLA showed practice of mindfulness to increase cortical thickening and structural integration. The brain, uhm, increase executive function, less distract ability in students, affect regulation against some of the studies at UCLA that show, uhm, stronger resiliency, Cliff Saron at, ah, UC Davis shows the ability to recover from shock and grief grow, all kinds of studies you can look them up. Uhm, underlying it is the fundamental human capacity to become the witness to experience, to become mindful which means to be present with the respect and a love for what's, what's present without getting entangled or caught by it, to witness the pleasures and pains of the body, the stream of emotions, the river of thoughts, the opinions and judgments, the longings and beliefs to be able to know these with mindfulness means that are capacity to be present in our window of tolerance to use that word grows. And so, you take your sit with your client or for whomever your training in these skills and in yourself and you invite this capacity of presence to be developed in them. Now, the tools, we'll go through a variety of them are pretty simple, uhm, the most common one is all these hands went up for people who have some meditative practice is to start with breath and for some people breath may be difficult. You can tell them to become, uhm, if, if they find the difficult to sense their breath, you can have them put their hand in their belly and just feel the rise and fall of the belly in the palm of their hand or if it's still difficult to be with breath, then, you know then you get curious. There's some kind of trauma there had somebody come in recently you couldn't be with her breath and it turned out when she was a child that her father who was a, ah, dentist in, in Nevada or something like that, they, they had a, a couple of cats and the cats had this huge litter of kittens and they couldn't give them away and so, he took some ether and she watched and he put the cats to sleep. She was like 7-years-old. Next year, she was supposed to have her tonsils out. He took her to his friend who is a physician and again of so long time ago, they took out a model of ether and it terrified her as you can imagine cuz that was the association. So now, when she begin to sit to meditate and close her eyes, what happens as you, as you begin to pay attention and get quite as the unfinished business of the heart will arise or the traumas right away, she couldn't be with her breath. Until we sat together for a little bit and said, "All right, be with a couple of breaths and see what happens and then see what images come, what memories come," and all of a sudden, all this trauma flooded back and we were able to work with it with compassion and mindfulness. So if somebody can't be aware of their breath that's, uhm, an invitation to get curious, what's going on that there's that makes it difficult. So you start with that and the idea isn't to become a good breather, you're already good at that but to use the breaths as a mirror to come into the present so you there mindful of a few breaths and then all this other stuff happens and you come back to your breath without judgment. The instruction from Julia Child is, "If you're in the kitchen and you drop the lamb, you can just pick it up. Who's gonna know, right?" And it's kinda that way in meditation, you come back, you feel a breath, you return again to it. But there you are minding your business trying to feel your breath and then all the waves of what you might consider distraction or difficulty arise right away. So we're sort of leaping in to the, the functioning of mindfulness and how to do it, that will do some other practices with it. So what do you do, there you are feeling your breath and the waves of sensations and sounds and thoughts or even the background and after five breaths comes sadness or tears or after six breaths and I'm bored or, or, you know, sleepiness and so forth, what do you do with that for yourself or for the people you work with? You let go of the mindfulness of breath which is just to establish the sense of presence and you receive that strong wave of experience as if were the vow with the same gracious attention you give in to the breath. So you're sitting there and you start to feel sleepy, you can either judge yourself, "Oh, I shouldn't be sleepy in terms of the meditating or mindful," or you can note, "Oh, sleepiness." In the monastery where I trained is called the poor man's Nirvana and, you know why you're sleepy, cuz you're tired cuz you'd been running around five years or 10 years, you look fine and your body says, "Hey, remember me?" So you start to pay attention what is the body asking or maybe you sit there and you feel really restless and if you're restless great. Sit there and experience restlessness cuz otherwise if you're restless or you're bored or you're lonely and you can't tolerate it, what do you do? You know, open the refrigerator, right? Go online something because you can't tolerate your own experience. So instead you sit and you start to feel restless and you vowed and then you say, "restless, restless," or "lonely, lonely," you know, and, uhm, I think it's the poet Hafiz who writes, "Don't surrender your loneliness so quickly. Let it cut more deep. Let it ferment and season you as few ingredients can." So you name it lonely, lonely and then you say, "Well, how lonely or bored, bored. I hate this loneliness." And you know, "Oh, it's not loneliness, a more hating, hating." You name that, okay. Hating and hating, lonely, lonely, hating, hating, I wish you would go away, wishing, wishing. You name that for a little bit. Say, I'm kinda doing this pretty well. Pride, pride, you know, the step. Then, you go back to the breath again or you say it in tears come and you let them come and, you know, it's sad, sad. In the Lakota Sioux, grief was considered one of the most Lakon, one of the most holy of all things and people who are weeping were considered closest to the gods cuz their heart swirled. So you honor tears, tears, the ocean of tears or maybe it's the judging mind, right? Stop that judging, you know, I'm sitting here and not doing it well enough. I should, shouldn't judge so much. I can't meditate right but I certainly shouldn't judge, I hate that judgment go away, you know, I don't wanna judge but what's that, a more judgment, right? So what do you do? Say, thank you for your opinion, right? You know, who recorded it in there. We won't talk about them but you think thank you for your opinion, this is the judging mind. Judging mind thank you, right. Or a fear comes and you name it, vow to it. In the first or the 20th or the 50th time it gets you and at some point you say, "oh fear, I know you." It has a story as Mark Twain said, "My life has been filled with terrible misfortunes most of which never happened," right. So you see its story, right. You feel in it in a body, fear, fear. I feel like I'm dying, dying, dying. I wonder what their gonna have for lunch. Dying, dying again, you know, cuz the mind, mind will do anything and there you are in the middle of dying and then, you know, it starts to think about something else and you begin to realize that the capacity to become the witness of experience gives you a freedom with trauma or with suffering with the roses with pain with all these kinds of things that people come with, you are beginning to train yourself of them in the capacity not to be entangled and the same with physical pain and there's all this great research in literature and Jon Kabat-Zinn's work in MBSR and so forth about how to bring mindfulness to pain in such a way that you hold that as if you were holding a crying child. You don't try to get rid of it, you know, add to it with your fear and resentment and all your stories and all the contraction, that's there, you vow it that there is contraction, there is fear, there is resentment and so forth. You allow that and you hold the whole mass as if you were holding a crying child who's diaper you've already change, who you've already feds says, now you can do about it but just the fact of that presence begins to allow it in its own way to entangle. Sometimes it will stay the same, sometimes it will get more intense, that's how your job. Your job is the presence and the goodness of heart to open it. So, I'm just giving right as we start some of the principles of presence that allow you to feel into the capacity of mindfulness as you train in yourself or with another person. Uhm, one of the most important things about it is not to be idealistic. If you have some idea of, okay now, I'm gonna can't get calm and peaceful and happy and so forth, uhm, you're on the wrong planet, right? You mean incarnation, praise and blame, gain and loss, pleasure and pain, joy and sorrows, sweet and sour everybody not have that or you could have your conference feedback, all right. Okay, here, if you can sit quietly after difficult news, if in financial downturns you remain perfectly calm, if you can see your neighbors travel to fantastic places without a twinge of jealousy, if you can happily whatever is put on your plate, if you can fall asleep after a day of running around without a drink or a pill, if you can always find contentment where you are, you are probably a dog. The point isn't to make some new ideal about things, you know, spare your friends and family. It is actually to be able to take your sit as the Buddha that you are under your own tree of enlightenment in this human form and say, yes, this is what human incarnation involves joy and sorrow and pleasure and pain to allow your measure of joy and also your measure of tears. So let's do a little more practice, okay. Put your feet flat on the floor perhaps sitting away that is both present and open.

JACK KORNFIELD Alert and yet also gracious. And when you're ready allow your eyes to close gently and first notice if there's any obvious tightness or attention in the body that you can easily release. Let the eyes and face be soft, losing the jaw. Relax the shoulders like the arms and hands rest easily. Let the belly be soft, the breath natural. Let the heart be soft as well to receive whatever arises with the spirit of kindness compassion. 

00:28:10
[sil.] 

00:28:15
JACK KORNFIELD And now, with this embodied presence, begin to notice the natural rhythm of the breath, how the breath breaths itself and feel it as coolness in the nostrils, swirling, tingling in the back of the throat or the rise and fall of chest or belly. Relax into the breath, attend to it senses. And with each breath let the body and mind come together calming a little bit centering. 

00:29:00
[sil.] 

00:29:30
JACK KORNFIELD And as you feel the breath there will be background sensations and sounds and thoughts. Let them rise and fall like waves of the ocean around this breath, this moment. Settle with the breathe quite present, open. Feel how the body breaths itself and if it's helpful put your palm on your belly and feel it rise and fall of the breath and the palm of your hand just leave it there. 

00:30:05
[sil.] 

00:30:40
JACK KORNFIELD And after a few breaths, you'll notice that one of the waves become stronger than background. It might be planning or remembering sadness, excitement, longing, love, pain, tingling. When a strong wave arises, let go of the focus on breathing and as if to vow to it, turn the mindful, loving attention to this wave of experience and name it gently sad, sad, or excitement, excitement or planning, planning and as you name it softly, whisper in the background, notice what happens to the wave. Feel how it moves through body and mind and notice as it passes away or as you make your piece with it. 

00:31:35
[sil.] 

00:31:45
JACK KORNFIELD And when the wave has diminished or your at ease with it, then just sense of presence of awareness itself just hearing now and again, feel the breath. 

00:32:00
[sil.] 

00:32:55
JACK KORNFIELD This breath or this strong wave met with a loving awareness this two. 

00:33:10
[sil.] 

00:34:15
JACK KORNFIELD Relax with this breath both present and kind. Notice the state of body as you tend to the breath. Let the body be at ease, soften. 

00:34:40
[sil.] 

00:35:05
JACK KORNFIELD Notice the state of heart too and being a loving awareness to whatever is present the tears, the angers, the fear, the delight. Name it gently and make space. And then feel the breath breathing with it. 

00:35:25
[sil.] 

00:36:00
JACK KORNFIELD If its difficult become curious, what is it that makes it hard to stay present, vow to that too with loving awareness, this two. 

00:36:15
[sil.] 

00:37:35
JACK KORNFIELD You did good. You know what that means? You're still here. Of course the, the content of experience isn't the critical dimension. The experiences will change the way the movies change. You get, ah, documentary or a love story or war movie or, ah, comedy, the capacity for presence is really what matters and it's not a small thing but it takes some training. It's like the man who wrote to the IRS and he said, "I haven't been able to sleep because I cheated on my taxes in 2010 and 2011. I have enclose a cashier's bank check no name on it. Uhm, for $2,000. If I still can't sleep. I'll send the rest." It's a training you do a little bit and then you do a little bit more and one of the beautiful things of understanding these principles is that in fact, the human mind and the nervous systems, you hear from all the neuroscientist, uhm, can actually be shaped and opened, uhm, and change by the way we cultivate our attention and it's not a small things. So story again, clinic-- clinical story. There was a young army officer who had a lot of trouble with anger and rage and flew off the handle very easily. And so, he was reminded by his superior officer to do an eight-week training course in mindfulness which they have in the military in some places I hope it goes up to chain of command more but that's another story, uhm, also in the, in the marines mind fitness, they're calling it pre-deployment especially-- anyway so he did his training and he was on the middle. And then after about six weeks, he was in the grocery store at night, uhn, cart full of groceries, crowded time, everybody in there you got to line and the woman in front of him was in the wrong line. She had one item, she should have been in the express line and he was one of those people in, ah, you know, kind of military mindset, you're supposed to do at the right way and he got a little irritated. She was carrying a baby, she gets up to the checkout stand and to the-- the clerk and she start cooing over the baby, you know, and goggling it or whatever you and, uhm, eh, and then she hands the baby to the clerk and he goes ballistic. Doesn't how, you know, insensitive. Doesn't-- she know there is a long line, it's crowded, it's late, you know, and so forth and he start to see it really work up and angry but because he'd been training in mindfulness for those six weeks, he could feel the contraction and he pain in his body of that anger. So he took some breaths, he notice that anger, anger, pain, pain and in doing so, he, he made the space in which that wave could pass. When he looked up, he noticed that actually was kind of a cute kid. So when he got up to the checkout clerk, he'd recovered a bit and said, "that was a cute little boy you were, you know, holding back there," and she said, "how do you like him and he is my boy. You see my husband was killed in Afghanistan last year so I have to work now and my mom takes care of him and she tries to bringing him once a day so I can see him." We are so quick to judge another human being or to judge ourselves, you know, most of you wouldn't be hired to be a judge in a civilized country. They'd say, "oh idiot man yeah, we got you, come on work on the bench," you know, uhm, we're so quick to be judgmental and the capacity of mindfulness of this training is learn to-- is learning to see not with the judging but rather to bring this capacity of mindful presence in what we'll call loving awareness and awareness that's not judging but did actually sees with the eyes and heart at the same time in a more gracious way not because you're suppose to but because it what makes human beings happy because it's your birthright. It's how you can live. All right, so some other principles of Buddhist psychology and as we go through them in the next couple hours or so, we will do some more practices, all right? So one of first principles, eh, key principles is the principle of original goodness or nobility or nobly born begin the Buddhist text. You heard sons and daughters of the awaken ones of, of dignity and I think about Nelson Mandela because his funeral is happening and he was such a extraordinary world figure walking out of Raven Island, freezing after 27 years was so much magnanimity and graciousness and forgiveness. Uhm, and Nelson said it never hurts to think too highly of a person, they often act the better because of it. So western psychology has been built around the, uhm, vision, the medical model of pathology. You have the DSM and you see all the different possible things that are wrong with people, right? And it started, you know, especially, I mean, there all this fields psychiatry and psychology and so what-- it wasn't medical profession when it's get to diagnosis and fix them or heal them but also clinical psychology group primarily after World War II. There weren't very many psychologist and then there were all these shell shock traumatized people coming back from World War II so the psychologist got into the clinical game a lot and it was all focused on trying that somehow, you know, heal people in a medical way. Uhm, and Dr. Freud who was remarkable and did all kinds of wonderful things but also had how do say, uhm, sometimes a little jaundice view about humanity wrote, "Civilization has to use its utmost efforts in order to set limits to man's aggressive instincts," we leave this in the masculine, "the ideal commandment to love one's neighbor as oneself -- a commandment which is really justified by the fact that nothing else runs so strongly counter to the original nature as this. So that's one view of humanity. Uhm, and we tend to see people then and the insurance companies want you to do that as their diagnosis, uhm, which is a pretty limited way to see another human being. On the other hand, the beginning vision of Buddhist psychology is to see that this is another being who is a Buddha, who has a Buddha nature of dignity and fundamental goodness who was born with this beautiful spirit and I see it when I hang out and teach with the Dalai Lama, you know, one of the beautiful things is you will go, uhm, down after he gives a talk in sort of goal like a plaque and to, to, to say hello to people and they'll be a long line of folks and will take your hand, uhm, and you kind of looking you-- look in your eyes and it's like, oh, cool one with the Dalai Lama and he's got such a big heart and such amazing being and the, the best thing is that he doesn't let go. And so, it's not like a politician archaist, this baby and move on to that and how many hands you can shake, he stays and you go this is fantastic, I'm there with the Dalai Lama and then you realize he's not letting go. And then, a couple more breaths you go, oh, he really wants you to get it that he's there and that he is offering a blessing and you looks it you in India, it's called the glance of mercy. It seems somebody was so much loved and compassion that they remember who they really are and this is really the ground of Buddhist practice, uhm, ah, Jungian analyst Robert Johnson noticed-- noted how difficult it is for many of us to believe in our goodness. We take our worst side to be our identity, uhm, and in the Jungian tradition it's called your shadow, you know, the, the unacknowledged parts, "Curiously," writes Johnson, "people resist the noble aspects of their shadow more strenuously than they hide the dark sides. It is more disrupting to find that you have a profound nobility of character than to find out you are a bum." You know, so to begin to see a person who comes in not by their diagnosis or their problem but to see their beauty and their fundamental dignity changes the whole game and then, you work give them some tools to work on their suffering and that's find but that's not the-- not that-- the fundamental principle. Suzuki Roshi Zen master said, "You're perfect just the way you are and there's still for improvement," you know, so kinda get both sides of it. Second principle is the shift of identity. People tend to be true, uhm, I'm looking at my notes and thinking how many switch-- second, principle we're gonna do a different second principle. Second principles compassion, third principle will be shift of identity. The Buddha was a list maker. He lied made lots of list and so, change them around here. He joined him as a list maker. Second principle is that awareness must be coupled with compassion. You must be coupled with love. You could call it loving awareness and we at conference with the Dalai Lama and all these western Buddhist teachers come about several decades ago and a big question teachers raised their hand and said, "What do you do about all the self-hatred and self-judgment that happens for people and students?" And Dalai Lama said, "Huh?" And said, "Self-hatred, self-judgment." He talked to his translator Thupten Jinpa back and forth in Tibetan, uhm, "there's no word for self-hatred in Tibetan," and finally he got itself hatred and then, you looked up you said, "have you experience this?" All the teachers raised their hands on him and he thought for him and he said, "Uhm, this is a mistake." So it turns out that in order to cultivate these capacities of mindful awareness that are liberating to the heart, it has to be paired with love. It has to be compared with compassion and the beautiful thing in Buddhist psychology is that compassion is considered in it. Yes, there is aggression. Freud was right in that way there's greed, there's hatred all you have to do is turn on the TV and you see the results of it but it's not the bottom line there are also a million or a billion acts of goodness and beauty and mercy happening every moment on this earth that someone tending another person or someone stopping at the red lights so somebody can go on the green. It's amazing and we don't attend to that. So my favorite kindergarten teacher Peggy has a school near the flight path of, ah, ah, air base and when we were getting ready for the Iraq war, remember that one? We are-- we're like nation in case you hadn't notice this in my lifetime it's just been a succession of them. It's a little bit time to maybe change our attitude but let's see. Anyway, uhm, and the kids were out playing and a big military transport plane flew over the-- out of school, uhm, and because that was loud and low they're running and they were scared and they said, "Peggy, Peggy what's that?" And she said, "Well it was a transport plane probably going to Iraq. Have you heard that there might be a war?" And they knew cuz their parents had the TV on and there's all that stuff about Iraq and they said, "What's on that plane Peggy? Are there bombs on that plane?" "Probably. Guns, yes. Soldiers, maybe. Tanks." And then one little boy said,"What are their-- are their kids like us in Iraq?" Peggy said, "There are." Said, "Well, they must not know that. They weren't send those bombs if they knew that. We have to let them know." And so, they took their butcher paper and they went out to the playground and they made this huge picture of a child and they said, "Peggy how do you spell butcher paper Iraq? I-R-A-- and spell out Iraq so that it was big enough that it could be seen from the air by the pilots. So that they would know there were children there and they would take care enough on." It is so innate in us and if you don't think-- I mean, you can get proud about that but then on the other hand, there's, there's a research by, uhm, Jean Decety and Inbal Bartal at University of Chicago that shows the a rat in a little tiny cage kind of with an another rat free-range rather in a bigger cage with a good accommodations and the free-range rat can let the squeaking rat that's tight and suffering out and learns how to do it. And then they give the free-range rat five chocolate chips and after a while not only as the rat learn to free the other rat it saves one or two chocolate chips for the rat that it left out. So, you can be proud but you know, it is innate in us because we are connected in love and in compassion and part of the game when people come to you yes, it's to help them and help them overcome things but part of it is just to sit in the presence of love and that's about as healing as anything you can do and I was teaching with Pema Chödrön in San Francisco, a great big event like this and several thousand people are compassion and, uhm, we are taking questions at the end of woman-- young woman's stood up and her partner had just two weeks before committed suicide. And she is sorrow and so much grief and suicide's are complicated, you know this because there is the grief but also there's the anger how can you do this and there's the guilt and there's the shame and, ah, it activates all this different complex emotions and stories and so Pema had her name knows and just hold everything with compassion which kind of soothe the room and then I could feel how she was pretty lonely in this, really felt alone. So I looked around and I said, How many people in this room of two or 3,000 people have had someone in your family or really close to you commit suicide? Would you stand up? Maybe 200 people stood up, you know, 8% whatever it is, and I said, would you just look at her and I said, keep you eyes open to her and just return your-- their gaze look and see and it's she has the room became some kind of a temple. There was so much understanding at love from the people who had suffered as she had and holding her without a word and a lot of times that's, that says bigger part of healing as the practices and techniques we have. So original goodness, the element of compassion or we'll call it loving awareness. Third principle and we'll do practices of, of compassion or forgiveness sometime in a little bit. Thank you, hang on there. Next principle, is shift of identity. We tend to take the small sense of self, the history, the story of ourselves and kind of rigidify it and actually believe that it's who are. It's called the body of fear in Buddha psychology and, uhm, well, I will think of this cartoon from Jules Feiffer where there's a man sitting reflective and a little disconsolate on a, on a saying, "I inherited my father's style of dressing and mo-- moving." Next panel, "I inherited my father's attitude about the world and, you know, perspectives and politics." Next panel, "I inherited my father's way of relating to people and then the fourth panel, "And I inherited my mother's contempt for my father," right. And so, there you have it, you know, we have all that and the thing is that we believe those that history people are actually quite loyal to their suffering cuz they don't know who they would be. Who are you if you're not your suffering, you know, and, and not that story but the beautiful and the capacity that we have is for a shift of identity and awareness is the gateway to that loving awareness. So here, simple, couple of examples, when you look in the mirror, you notice you've age, right? Basic, right? The fur diminishes here. There is drooping, sagging, wrinkling or whatever but the weird thing is you don't necessarily feel older, right? You know that thing, I, I don't feel old but look that it's, you know, it's sagging or whatever. Uhm, that's because, it's only your body that has aged and the body exist in time it's born, it has this conditions and it grows here. The infant body, the child body, the adolescent body widely changes so much actually. Is that amazing? You think it's you but it's this huge process but in that moment of looking in the mirror, uhm, it's aging, there is a moment of resting an awareness that knows that you are not this body, you inhabit in with consciousness or spirit, what you are is the loving awareness saying, "uhm, gone a little, you know, saggy over there or whatever," but something in you knows that the body is not who you are, not to speak of your personal history. I was just teaching with Ram Dass who write this wonderful retreat that the focus on love was quite beautiful. I'll tell some stories from it and, uhm, he's 82 and still, still going. Uhm, anyway at one point somebody raise their hand years earlier when he was Baba Ram Dass with his beads and beard coming from India wearing white and they said, wait a second, you're teaching all these Hindu teachings but won't you raise Jewish? You know, didn't you go to temple and said, yes and I was bar mitzvah as I was, you know, and, and he said and I, and I respect your wish teaching, ah, the Cabbala, the Jewish mystical tradition, the Hasid's and said, I, I also love those teachings. And then he looked out with the certain reflection and he said, but remember I'm only Jewish on my parents side. And it's, you know, he was very witty but there is something quite profound about it too that who you are is not limited to the identity of your parents, of your gender, of your race, of your, you know, class, of your creed, the Buddha welcome people and he said, ears what makes nobility is not class or race or creed or history or trauma, it is nobility of heart. It's Nelson Mandela or Aung San Suu Kyi walking out of years of prison and say, you can imprisoned the body you cannot imprison this human spirit. And so, to recognize this and invite the shift of identity I have this woman who came to see me whose husband had just left and abandon her and their 3-year-old child and geez, big surprise it turned out that when she was three or 4-years-old her father had left and so, of course, it was that kind of repetition that we see so often trying to work things out in some way. Uhm, and so, we work a lot in the grief and the loss and her anger and all the kinds of things you'd expect and then, underneath it I could sense that from the early loss she had develop the story as children do to try to understand that her father left cuz he didn't love her. As he left, she never saw him again, he died within the year. And so, I had her close her eyes when she was ready and went back and meditated or kind of a guided inner practice and there she was the day her father left wearing this blue gingham dress at the top of the stairs and her parents are shouting and her father has the suitcase and he's about to walk out and slammed the door never come back and she sees him from the top of the stairs and he doesn't look up and he goes out. And I say, "What do you-- what-- what's happens for you?" And she said, "I'm full of grief. I love him and I feel like I've done something wrong. If he love me, he wouldn't leave. There must be something wrong me. I'm not lovable and not only that's why he left and now husband left the same thing." So I say, "All right, that's what that little girl believe now go and see if you can get in to your father's body." We took a little bit of time, what is it feel like, "Oh, it's tight angry, frightened, trying to get out of here. I said her, "Why?" "Oh, I made the wrong marriage. I marry this person, we fight all the time. I feel like I'm suffocating, I'm gonna die if I stay in this relationship. I judge her, she's so harsh me. We just or not good, it feels poisonous. I've got to get out of here." "But what about your daughter, don't you know she's standing at the top of the stairs?" "Yes." "Well, why don't you look at or why don't you say goodbye?" She said, "because if I take one look at her, I couldn't leave. I love her so much, I couldn't leave and I've got to get out of here or I'll die." So she's there with that new information consciously anyway and I say, "Right now, go back and be the little girl in the blue gingham dress. What's the story she tells to herself?" "He's leaving cuz he doesn't love me. He's leaving there's something wrong with me." I said, "Open your eyes and look at me and just tell me of simple thing, who made that story?" "I did." "Yeah." "Who made the story, I, I guess I did." One more thing, let's just pay attention for a moment, is it true? Is it true? And in that moment, it was a kind of challenge to the story and identity of who she believe she was and finally, she had to say, no. I said, so the whole idea that you're not lovable, that's it-- that's an interesting story, isn't it? You know that's the story to makeup. Who are you really? And then we began to sit in a very different dimension of her being. Do you understand this? Of course, you do from your work. So the very notion that identity itself can shift is immensely liberating and the tools that allow it are these tools of compassion, the tools of loving awareness itself, the tools of being able to witness.

JACK KORNFIELD A couple more and then practice, right? Next principle, there's a clear understanding of the difference between pain and suffering and the end of suffering, a map to it. Pain, part of the ride where at Disneyland. Do they still have the e-tickets, you know, like the top rides that you'd get. You took the e-ticket for the human incarnation ride and with it you get, praise and blame, you get pleasure and pain, you get birth and death, you get loss and you get renewal, joy and sorrow, all those things that we talked about a few minutes ago. That's this planet, that's human na-- if you want something else I think you got a incarnate somewhere else but that's human incarnation is about. There is a distinction between pain and suffering. Pain is natural. Sometimes the body hurts, sometimes it feels beautiful. Sometimes, there's loss and the grief that's quite natural from that, you know, or death those are all natural. Suffering is what we add to it and suffering is cause by clinging, by resistance, by greed, by fear, by all the reactions we have to experience. And the beautiful thing is, that when we recognize the difference just as that MBSR work of pain in the body when you approach that pain that you'd been trying to get rid of for 10 years and find the John Cabot since started is clinic in the basement of the medical school in Massachusetts went to ground rounds and said, "Send me the patients you can't help. The ones with intractable pain, the ones with medical conditions you've done everything you can. I want the ones you can't help because you said to me kind of a, as in the side later on cuz we have the strongest medicine," and that is the medicine of truth that this is the way of things are and the capacity of the human heart to bear witness to this incarnation with its choice and sorrow as we have that, that's, that's our medicine. So he would come who would been resisting and hoping and trying to get rid of and struggling against their experience and he said, "All right, let's find the way to be present for the experience in a way with, ah, gracious heart, in a way that allows you to tolerate your humanity and actually bring compassion to it." And so, the difference between pain and suffering and the fact is that gradually it's possible to find these release if you will Zen master Suzuki Roshi says, "When we realize the fact that everything changes and find our composure in it, then, we find ourselves in nirvana." That is just to release a joy, a peace that comes saying, this is the way things are. There was a moment that this retreat, with Ram Dass there were people with cancer diagnosis, people who loss children, people coming back from Haiti and Afghanistan doing front line work as many of you do in your clinics and so forth and he was talking to this person who's child had, uhm, been killed died and 17-years-old in an accident and he said, oh, but, you know, her life, uhm, all these things of-- that we were expecting that didn't happen that she could have been, all could those could have been and at some point, I'm just to sat with, ah, the parents, the dad and look at with tremendous love and said, "it was her time." It was a kind of amazing moment, uhm, because you said it was so much love he didn't deny the loss and the tragedy and somewhere the grief of it but also he said it from this place of a really vast perspective. It was her time and the whole room kind of held its breath or maybe it was her time. It was her time because she died and there's some way in which not only does the heart become caught and entangled but with the trainings of loving awareness, compassion, witnessing of this human life, even in the great difficulties we can become free. Here, a friend who wrote My Days Are Short. She was dying of cancer. "And as I grow weaker, I experience so much gratitude from my meditation and training. Not only the joy and ease it brought but the hard parts for every bored and restless sitting, in every fearful fantasy that I sat through, in every pain and ache that I tolerated, in every itch I didn't scratch was a training for kindness. A training for the muscle for bearing witness for the trusting spirit that caress me now even as I face my death." So really talking about learning the skills that allow someone to die well which it turns out as the same coin as to live well, you know, and the poet Hafi-- Hafiz again says, uhm, "Fear is the cheapest room in the house. I would like to see you living in better conditions." So when you trained yourself in this you become able to hold the measure of humanity, of the joys and sorrow that are brought to you and you realize that there's a relief from suffering that's possible for human beings and you transmit that there's a kind of trust, the poet Pablo Neruda says, "You can pick all the flowers but you can't stop the Spring." And somehow people come to you to feel the trust that it's possible to live this human life with its difficulties in the different way and it's not the cultural narrative, it's not the narrative you get, you know, on advertising and on the TV and online and so forth which is you know, accumulate and all of that stuff. It's-- but it's in narrative for the soul that you, that you offer. I guess-- well, let's see where are we. Uhm, getting close to the next training but I wanna tell a story and then we'll talk about the next kind of training. Uhm, and in a way, it's out of respect for the work that you do and it's not to say you have to make it religious but that there is a spiritual dimension and for any genuine deep feelings to take place the physical, the emotional, the relational, the communal and the spiritual all have to be included. So a friend, ah, there's a psychologist whose specialty is working with people who had been tortured. She were hired by the U.N. for a while and she work with people coming from Bosnia, in Argentina, in Afghanistan, in Saudi Arabia, in Indonesia, in Burundi and U.S. and the problem as I could name almost every country in the world it's the horrifying thing to even say but it's true. Anyway, when she would come and meditate and sit what would happen is that she would get flooded with, ah, reruns of some of the horrific stories and so, she said, "I need help with this." So I told her some practices, one of which included sweeping compassion down to her body and clearing out, you know, repeatedly doing some minutes of just clearing out everything that's held in her body and returning it back to mother earth, bringing in the sense of sunlight and luminosity as a kind of cleansing. We do a vary of practices holding, holding at all the compassion different kind of trainings and then at some point I said to her, "Tell me about your office. Where do you sit? What it's like?" She said, "Oh, you know, usual lamp here, table there. I sit here. People come in." I said, "All right, I have a suggestion for you. Behind you on the long wall in, ah, you know, room, I want you to put a shelf and on the shelf I want you to put a statue of the Buddha, next to Buddha a statue of Quan Yin, the Bodhisattva of infinite compassion and next to her Guadalupe and then Mother Mary and one of Jesus, a couple of other saints if you get them and while you're at then also put a page from the Koran about the mercy of Allah because you see people from, you know, Indonesia and from, you know, Bahrain or whatever and, you know, put a Star of David on there, uhm, and you see people from Haiti put their gods and basically any god put definitely-- put Kali on there and Durga as well, you know, cuz you need backup, right. And then I said, here's the thing, I said, it's not right for you as an individual to carry this measure of sorrows. It's not given to you to do that. You have to become more transparent in some way. First releasing it from your body but I said, so this is what to do. You come in the morning, you know, you laid the candle back there, you vow and you say, okay, you gods, you know, all of you helps that plural when you need them, you know, please hold this with me. And then, when people come in to their-- your office they won't just see you, they'll see who is behind, they will see that this isn't just being held by a person but this is being held by something so much greater in this universe and then at the end of the day, before you go home make a ritual in which you make another vow, think of all the things you've heard and place them in the arms of Mother Mary or Guadalupe or Solomon or whoever it is, whatever, you know, Kali to hold for you so that you can release it there and, and leave your office and, and be yourself and that somewhere else. Is this how it make sense to you and it doesn't mean you have to literally do that a Kaiser although maybe you could, I don't know, you know. They know your weird already cuz you're here but, uhm, but there's something to take in about it that tells you about the sacredness of the work you're doing. All right, so principles of nobility, compassion, shift of identity, the distinction between pain and suffering and the capacity that, that you transmit as trust to be able to hold this with the great heart of compassion. Uhm, systematic trainings cuz we've talk about trainings and mindfulness, mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of the emotions so that again from the research people become their window of tolerance growths, uhm, I, I talked resilience academic performance growth because kids are able to focus who have some social and emotional learning skills affect regubi-- regulation, uhm, ah, you learn through this systematic trainings. The skill or the capacity to be present for physical experience and you can sit with someone and teach them. All right, soften around that open, be mindful name that, you can be were name the emotions and people don't know what, uhm, what emotions that they're feeling, you know that very well. I gonna tell the story, I know there isn't time. Okay, so, uhm, but you-- you're training them in a vocabulary of emotions, helping them to understand what they feel like sensing it with then, naming it with them or even suggesting maybe, "Geez, that might feel cheap. If that happen to me, I would feel and so, oh yeah, and so, you're beginning to help them, it's really a paired meditation, paired manuals, you're beginning to help them with your capacity to be present, to become present for their life in the way that's not entangling but it's le-- that's liberating. Then, not only can you train in the foundations of mindfulness of body feelings of, of thoughts. So let's do a thought practice for a moment. Okay, there was a cartoon in the New Yorker of a car crossing the Utah dessert, right? And, ah, roadside billboard read, "Your own tedious thoughts next 200 miles," right, okay. So that's like meditation, right. So here's the practice that were gonna do and this is like the basis of cognitive therapy, the Buddha talk about the carpenters peg where you use a little tiny peg to remove a big peg in a piece of furniture. We'll get to that. So here's the game. Ah, it's a one-minute meditation and what I want to invite you to do is to count your thoughts, okay. You're gonna sit here like the cat and the mouse hole, right, and they're tricky little mice, okay, cuz sometimes they'll be picture thoughts, sometimes they'll be word thoughts but then the little sneaky ones would come and say, "There haven't been many thoughts here, have their, oh yeah, you guy, are you right?" And don't count the numbers they are a thought but that's called the cat chasing its stale, you don't wanna do that. So you just sit for a minute and count your thoughts. Okay, let your eyes goes gently, take a breath or two, on your mark get set go. 

01:16:10
[sil.] 

01:17:15
JACK KORNFIELD I had a question for you, how many thoughts did you count? Just some numbers. Six, 10, 13, four, nine, 18, does that mean that the person who had 18 thoughts had more thoughts or did the person who had four thoughts just have longer ones, right? Now, how many of you had just picture thoughts without words? Usually, it's about 10, 15% you know that of yourself why your thinking images. All group of you have word thoughts without pictures, right? And then some middle group get the audio visual portion together. Some of you almost get kinesthetic thoughts. It's like the thoughts sip up through your body, right? But the other weird thing is that you're actually not thinking them. There's the, the mind secretes thoughts the way the salivary glands secretes saliva. This river of the images and words, right? You don't ask for them. The beautiful thing about this one-minute practice which you already know is it it's possible to become the witness the loving awareness of the thoughts rather than identified with the thoughts and to know that is immensely liberating. Again, in the earliest, you know, text of cognitive therapy, so the Buddha says, you notice the thoughts with mindfulness and if they don't have your best interest in mind, then you can also replace those thoughts with loving thoughts or compassionate thoughts. This is a favorite practice of the Dalai Lama. Notice if the thoughts do not have your best interest in mind, condition in different ways and say, okay, thank you for your opinion and then replace them with the thought of love or compassion or well being and these trainings are possible. So there's all these different trainings. Trainings of mindfulness of thought, of body, of emotion, trainings of transforming emotions, trainings of feelings the demon, trainings of, uhm, ah, forgiveness of joy, uhm, and the beautiful thing about these trainings, you know, this clearly spelled out trainings and systematic. There's trainings in generosity is that they affect first to mind and heart but then they begin to also affect the way you treat one another. So there's a kind of multiple dimension and a lot of that stuff is spelled out in various things that I've written is mainly other books but this particularly this book, The Wise Heart has a lot of the teachings that we're doing today. It's guide to the universal teachings of Buddhist psychology. All right, so, uhm, let's do in a few minutes after a setup kind of let's do a different training and this will be just as we've started to do at training in awareness of the breath or naming the experiences and becoming the loving awareness that allows mindfully-- mindfulness to receive experience or counting the thoughts, you can do a training in forgiveness and it's one thing to say you should forgive that's the wrong medicine. It's another thing to say forgiveness is possible. Uhm, and it's again one of the 108 or 100 or 1008 different trainings in Buddhist psychology. So let me talk about it a little bit. Uhm, first of all, forgiveness doesn't mean that you condone what happened in the past, people need to understand the architecture of it. You may say, never again. I will do everything I can in my power to prevent myself or others from being harmed. I don't condone this, uhm, secondly, forgiveness is not some quick papering over, you know, it might be a year or two of grief and rage and anger and sadness and conflict and all of those things and thirdly, forgiveness is not for anybody else. Somebody who hurt or harmed you and you don't have to ever talk to them again. Doesn't mean you have anything to do with them. That person who hurt or harmed you or those people, they could be in Hawaii right now having nice vacation you-- I hate them, I hate them. Who is suffering? It's for yourself. It's re-- it's like the two ex-prisoners of war, one who turns to the other and says, "You know, have you forgiven our captors yet?" And the second one said, "After what they do to us never, never." And first one says, "Well then, they still have you in prison, don't they?" So really forgiveness is for your own heart. It's to give up all hope for a better past or another way of putting it is to forgive means not to put another being out of your heart, doesn't mean you have to like them or do you have anything to do with them but it's to not carry the toxin of hatred and the poison of your resentment to queer hearts so that you're free to love and sometimes it happens in little ways, you know, just learning the art of forgiveness and then, sometimes for almost everybody at some point in your human incarnation, you're gonna be called upon to do some great forgiveness. You know, and it might be because of the what happened with the will or it might be because of the divorce or it might because of what someone did to a family member or-- we all experience betrayals and loses sometimes tremendous ones. And I remember, meeting a man, uhm, name Richard Brown. I was on a train going to Philadelphia from Washington D.C. on my way to my father's memorial service. I sat next to this interesting guy. An African-American fellow who he ask me what I did, you know, in making conversation sometimes I say, I'm in sales or theater but anyway, I told him, I'd been a Buddhist like it turned out he worked in the foreign service in India, uhm, ah, and he quit after a while because he said the way that people in the embassy and so forth were treating the Indian servants and people work for them just didn't feel right to me. So now he run organization in D.C. that work with incarcerated youth and especially those who had committed murder. And he said, "Can I tell you a story?" I said, "Sure." So he said, "One of our kids came in," he said, "this young man was in a gang and, ah, to get jumped in or more than that to prove himself 14-years-old, he took his gun out one day and he shout another kid he didn't know just to kinda prove like, you know, an initiation cuz we don't initiation our kids. It's like a going to shoot a lion but there is no elders to initiate." Their initiating themselves and that's the whole other story, why would it mean to bring ritual and initiation back to our teens and so forth. Uhm, he shot this kid and kill him. And, uhm, he was arrested and trialed and at the end of the trail convicted in judge said guilty sentenced him and before he could leave the court, the mother of the boy who is shock stood up, look to him and said "I'm gonna kill you" things have back down and then, he was handcuffed and taken off to juvenile prison. And, uhm, a year later she started-- she went to visit him and he was really freaked out at first but she said, "I just go to talk to you, you know, here you shot my son," and she started conversation and then she start to visit him periodically, every few months and then, she start to bring him things and give him a little money to get stuff or you know, bring him certain things and for the next three years, she visited him 'til he was about to turn 18 and they were gonna let him out. She said, "So where you gonna go?" He said, "I really had don't and I don't got any place to go." She said, "Well, a got a spare room in my house, you could stay there for a bit if you need to. What's you gonna do when you get out?" "I don't know, you know." And she said, "Well, I got a friend who is gotta kind of little factory and stuff like that. Maybe I can get you a job." So he came to live with her. She got him a job. He stay in her house and after six months, she called him in the living room one night and she say, "I need to talk to you." He said, "Sure." She sat down, she quipped to him and she said, "Remember that day in court when you were convicted of shooting my son and I stood up and I said, I'm gonna kill you." He said, "Yes ma'am, I'll never forget that." She said, "Well, I have. You see, I didn't want a boy who could murder another as you did in cold blood they're still remain on this earth and so I said about visiting you and bring you stuff and talking to you and changing you and I brought you into my house and I gave you room. I've got a job. I'd been feeding and you're not that boy anymore. You're not that young man anymore but I don't have anybody. He was my only son, you know, and I'm livin' alone and I've got to this room and I wanna know if I can adopt you. Could you be my son cuz you didn't have any good parents either." And he said, "Yes. Yes, I will." So what's possible for the human heart Nelson Mandela showed it is remarkable and when you know this and when you can transmit it not just from the this is an idea but this is the reality of our human life then you offer this possibility. When I first thought forgiveness practice, my teacher said, do it couple times a day for a five or 10 minutes for the next months and then let me know how it's going which meant basically do it 300 times, right? And sometimes, I'll do it and say, "I'll never for-- I hate that SOB. You know, I'll never go for raah! All right, you brings up its opposite or sometimes you feel so numb and then I hate doing this. I don't wanna do this forgiving, forgiving, hating, hating, you know, just noticing that." What you just doing like water and there's still little by little by little and then at some point it's like your heart of it, all right, I forgive. You know, a little tiny bit, like that, okay. You know, $2,000 if I still can't sleep I'll send them the rest basically it's that how it works you know, and little by little the heart softens and you realize that that's not who you want yourself to be and who you are. So forgiveness is also often combined with the practice of loving kindness or compassion so we'll do them together in the minute, uhm, I will have you stand up and stretch for a second but not yet, not yet. Uhm, and, uhm, I'm just gonna say something about the loving kindness practice. We'll just do it tiny bit of it, many of you may know what it's there is lots of CDs and DVDs and downloads from myself or Steven Lavigne or Sharon Salzberg or Jon Kabat-Zinn, you can get it all over. Uhm, the thing that's hard for people in the west is to love themselves it's where it starts generally in far more Tibet but if you say begin with yourself people usually can't do it. Like it feels egotistical or weird or how could I do that? So we're gonna turn the tables and do it a little differently to give you the sense of how you can begin the practice of loving kindness and then spread it. So, let's take 30 seconds in silence, just stand up and let your body stretch for a moment. Remember that you as James Joyce wrote, "Mr. Duffy lived a short distance from his body, right?" And kind of come back and feel yourself actually hear in this room and present. Hah! Take a few deep breaths. Feel how it wants to move or stretch. Then, we'll take a pause and check in after these practices. Hah!

JACK KORNFIELD Hah! And when you feel like you've stretch and moved a little bit and you're ready to sit for 10, 15 minutes then that yourself sit back down with some ease and graciousness. It's hard to do loving kindness if your body is killing you. So, ah... 

01:30:35
[sil.] 

01:30:45
JACK KORNFIELD And we'll do the forgiveness as a guided practice although again it's written out and lots of this places and you can also get it this, ah, again as a practice online so you can hear it, uhm, and remember the most important thing is not to use it to judge yourself. It will bring up whatever it needs to bring up. It will bring up its opposite, you'll fall asleep, you will do all kinds of things and the only thing you're ask to do is to hold that whole experience with forgiveness and compassion of you and hatred comes up then you hold that too with kindness, all right? So let your eyes close gently. 

01:31:35
[sil.] 

01:31:40
JACK KORNFIELD And first just come back to the quality of presence. Feel your body, breath itself, your human life. Breathing with all those children who are eating cotton candy next door at Disneyland. Some tired and some smiling interbreeding with the palm trees and the wind that comes over the Pacific Ocean, the dusted the tops of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa and they'll comes into your lungs. The wind that filled itself with oxygen from the rainforest of Borneo and also carries a little bit cesium from Fukushima, you know, we're all interrelated we're breath with this living breathing sphere of life with its joys and sorrows. Feel your body breath. 

01:32:35
[sil.] 

01:32:50
JACK KORNFIELD And as you breath out gently bring your area-- bring your attention to the area of the heart. Let's see if you could breath gently in and out of the heart. 

01:33:05
[sil.] 

01:33:10
JACK KORNFIELD There are three dimensions to forgiveness directions will do them now. First, there are many ways in which I have hurt and harmed others, betrayed them, abandoned them, we all have cause and pain. Let yourself remember one or more ways in which you have caused harm to others. Feel the regret. Feel how you still carry it in your body and being. 

01:33:55
[sil.] 

01:34:05
JACK KORNFIELD And in the many ways it-- I have hurt and harmed others which I remember now that I've caused them pain, abandoned or betrayed them out of my own fear, out of my own hurt, out of my own confusion and anger and ignorance and difficulty. In this moment, I ask their forgiveness. In this moment, I ask your forgiveness. Please forgive me. 

01:34:55
[sil.] 

01:35:00
JACK KORNFIELD And let yourself sense that it's possible to be forgive. 

01:35:10
[sil.] 

01:35:35
JACK KORNFIELD And then it becomes so clear that a second direction of forgiveness is necessary just as you ask forgiveness of others. So to you have forgive yourself and then the many ways just as I've hurt and harmed others, betrayed them, abandoned them, so in the same way I've harmed myself, betrayed myself, abandoned cause pain in myself as I have to others. I remember this now too and let yourself remember one or a number of ways that you betrayed or hurt yourself as you have others. Feel the sorrows you still carry. 

01:36:35
[sil.] 

01:36:55
JACK KORNFIELD And in the many ways I've hurt or harmed myself just as I've harmed others, betrayed, abandoned myself out of my fear and confusion, out my hurt or anger or pain. In this moment, I offer myself forgiveness. If you want, you can even put your hand in your heart, mercy, tenderness. I did the best I could or knew how at that time, acted out of my own fear and confusion and pain. Now I offer myself forgiveness too. I forgive myself and breath gently and feel the possibility of receiving forgiveness. 

01:37:55
[sil.] 

01:38:25
JACK KORNFIELD And then the third direction just as I've hurt and harmed others or to others who harmed me we've each been betrayed, abandoned, cause pain to suffering. I remember this now to and I remember one or more ways you've been hurt and the sorrows you still carry. 

01:38:55
[sil.] 

01:39:00
JACK KORNFIELD And as you feel the sorrows in your body and remember the person circumstance in the ways that I have been hurt or harmed by you cause pain, abandoned, betrayed out of your ignorance and out of your hurt and anger, out of your pain and confusion to the extent that I'm ready I offer you to forgiveness, to the extent that I'm ready I forgive you. I release you. I will not carry hatred in my heard. 

01:40:00
[sil.] 

01:40:05
JACK KORNFIELD To the extent that I'm ready, I forgive you. 

01:40:15
[sil.] 

01:40:35
JACK KORNFIELD And having ask forgiveness of others offered forgiveness to yourself and extended as best as you can in this moment, your now prepared to do a practice of meta-loving kindness just for a little bit longer and while traditionally one might start with oneself in this culture it has to think of someone who loves you whom you love and which an easy relationship one that's not complicated or difficult, the most natural relationship of some being you love, it could even be a dog or the Dalai Lama but especially someone that knows you, your dog or your good friend or family member, someone you care about and picture them, bring them to mind. Now, that the heart has been soften with forgiveness you view them and you offer them the simple well-wishings of loving kindness as you see them in the mind's eye think of them. May you be filled with loving kindness or held in loving kindness. May you be safe from all dangerous, protected. May you be safe, protected. Feel your care for them. May you be well in body and mind. Healed strong. And may you be happy, truly happy. 

01:42:55
[sil.] 

01:43:00
JACK KORNFIELD Seeing them in your mind's eye holding them in your heart, may you be held in loving kindness filled with that. 

01:43:10

01:43:15
JACK KORNFIELD May you be safe and protected.

[sil.] 

01:43:35
JACK KORNFIELD May you be happy. 

01:43:40
[sil.] 

01:43:45
JACK KORNFIELD Now think of another person you love a lot that's not too complicated and bring them into the mind's eye and heart, stand them next to this other persons so now you've got two of them and the same well-wishing of intentions cuz you see them too. May you as well be held in great loving kindness filled with it. 

01:44:15
[sil.] 

01:44:20
JACK KORNFIELD And may you to be safe and protected. 

01:44:25
[sil.] 

01:44:30
JACK KORNFIELD Feel your caring for them. May you be well, healed. 

01:44:40
[sil.] 

01:44:45
JACK KORNFIELD And may you be happy, deeply happy. 

01:44:50
[sil.] 

01:45:00
JACK KORNFIELD Now imagine or assents that this two who you love can look back at you with same gaze with the gaze of mercy and love. They look at you and they offer the same wishes. They care about you and they say to you, may you too be filled with loving kindness. May you too be safe and protected in every way. They want this for you. 

01:45:40
[sil.] 

01:45:45
JACK KORNFIELD And may you be well and healed. Feel their love. And may you be happy, they wish. May you be happy. And this well-wishing in and again if you like you can put your hand on your heart or your body and offer it in the same way to yourself as they have thought they showed you. May I filled with loving kindness just as they wish for you. 

01:46:25
[sil.] 

01:46:30
JACK KORNFIELD May I safe and protected.

[sil.] 

01:47:30
JACK KORNFIELD And where are we to continue this traditional training you would bring in other loved ones and benefactors and then friends and then all the people around and then animals and the world and then you'd start with difficult people and the enemies until little by little you learn to offer the well-wishing and loving kindness to beings everywhere. And when you hear the bell open your eyes. Stay with the loving kindness for, ah, half a minute and look around and offer your loving well-wishes to all these other beings sitting around you. They'd like it. 

01:48:20
[sil.] 

01:48:40
JACK KORNFIELD Pretty sweet, isn't it? So a few important things to say about this training, again a reiteration that it's not the idea of perfecting yourself or changing yourself Florida Scott-Maxwell, an author. She wrote, "No matter how old a mother is she watches her middle-aged children for signs of improvement," right? And so you can do this practice that kind of, you know, grimed duty or a self-improvement game. I'll go to therapy. I'll go the gym. I'll diet and I'll do meditation and it's not that. The idea isn't to perfect yourself, it's to perfect your love for whatever you find and sometimes it's numbness and deadness and sometimes I hate this meditation, I can't do it and in self-judgment. Can you see all that and you say, yes, this two, this two. And you begin this practices with a recitation often. An invitation that said that is you train in these your dreams becomes sweeter and you fall asleep more easily and people will love you and animals will love you and you vow. If you walk by elephants will vow to you it says and you can try it in a zoo, you know, and your babies are happy in the womb and happy years as they grow up and if you fall of a cliff, a tree will always be there to catch and so forth and you start to feel the blessings of it. I will sometimes instruct people or tell them people that it feels right to a year of loving kindness practice for yourself and they'll go oh no, like, like the most horrible thing I've just hold them to do and they find that struggle and they do it and they do it and it changes their life and it doesn't change them, it actually changes their relationship to everybody else because when you really hold yourself in that way, you become happier and you become kinder to the checkout clerk in, ah, you know, the crying child and, ah, you know, the people in traffic around you because you're traffic to them, remember as well and you start to live in a different way. So the next thing to say, a couple more principles and then one more practice and, ah, you got again about an hour, uhm, can you-- are you with me to take it inactive deeper? Go further with this? Yeah. All right, so a couple more principles and another practice that takes at even deeper and very beautiful practice. Uhm, in Buddhist psychology there's a clear map of mental health. I teach a lot with Dan Siegel who many of you have listen to and who's a good friend and so forth and he is fond of saying, you know, in all my psychiatry training and so forth, we heard a lot about pathology and all the things that were wrong and you pick up the DSM and so forth but nobody define what mental health was. It's all about what mental illness have different kind exist. In Buddhist psychology, there are three things in human experience. There are the six senses seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and touching, the sense doors that's one thing that you have, okay., and the mind is considered as six sense door because it receives thoughts and images and intuitions and so feelings. So you have, sight, sound, taste, smells, bodily sensations and mental impressions. Anybody have anything more than that? Raised your hand, just checking, okay. It's like an artist with the palette. These are the colors that make up human experience. The second thing you have as a human being is this mysterious quality that western psychology hasn't studied yet called consciousness. And consciousness is defined as the knowing faculty. It's the dimension of being. It's the awareness itself that receives experience. Consciousness in the sight that comes consciousness in the sound because if you're sit with somebody who's just died their body still warm, right. Their, their breath is gone, conscious are gone but their eyes might be open, light is still striking the retina the, you know, the neural optic nerve is still firing and so forth but what's missing is consciousness. So to have a human experience you have the sense experience of color and sound and its thought feeling and the knowing of it, right? One more thing, in between consciousness and sense experience, our whole array of what are called mental states, a few of them are common in every moment but most of them fall in two categories, healthy and unhealthy and there's a list if you wanna look in this book of 52 of them some Buddhist traditions have a 108 of them, you know, the monks, they didn't have anything to do so they started making list, right. Anyway, uhm, the unhealthy states start with reactions to experience either grasping it, greed, wanting more, aversion, fear, pushing it way, aggression or ignorance, delusion not seeing it clearly and then based on those qualities, those fundamental pushing away or grasping or not seeing clearly then they arise-- let me see if I can find the list here. Uhm, a whole panoply of other unhealthy states worry, envy, rigidity, agitation, self-centeredness, average, shamelessness, close-mindedness, misperception and when they get stronger, you know, fear turns into panic and, uhm, you know, rigidity turns in to obsession and all the things you see in the DSM are, are extremes of these unhealthy states. Now it turns out that the opposite states when they are cultivated or when they are developed the, the two can exist together that they are recipli-- reciprocally inhibitive so that instead of the roots of resistance and grasping and fear and confusion and so forth. The healthy states have the mental roots of clarity which is what we've been practicing with mindfulness or it sometimes called wisdom seeing clearly, they have the healthy root of love rather than of hatred or judgment and they have the healthy root of appreciation which includes generosity and so forth and when those states come and they come with mindfulness with being present they give rise to confidence, graciousness, flexibility, modesty, joy, insight, equanimity, adaptability, a lot of things that the neuroscience research is showing grow from the training of mindfulness so that all of mental health can be seen and all of the hundreds of Buddhist practices and trainings and many of the westerners can be seen as ways to release consciousness from its troll with fear, confusion, greed using skillful means to release those and to cultivate or awaken love, clarity, generosity wisdom and those become the basis from mental health and so, if you wanna measure it you can look and see how off and then how much time do people spend in fear, confusion, agitation, greed, envy and so forth. What trainings or what practices or what interventions are needed to help them release that and discover well being, joy, equanimity and balance and those things can be trained and then the beautiful thing is it if you were to take the DSM and really work with it there would be an entirely opposite second volume of the enhanced capacities because we just go from you know, pathology the normal but in fact, uhm, let me see I might even have a list of it in here if I look. Uhm, mam-mam-mam, kinda wanna find it so. 

01:57:20
[sil.] 

01:57:25
JACK KORNFIELD D-- DS. Uhm, not in here but I'd been-- anyway, you would find a list of 25 kinds of joy, you would find a list of, uhm, 15 kinds of inner light that come to consciousness as you gets through pure and this is in some metaphor, or some nice poem you read by Rumi, if you read Christian mystics or Sufi mystics or, or people are contemplatives or shamans there is actually an inner luminosity that comes when the mind and heart become clear and pure. They are all these different ta-- development of happiness and joy. There's vast equanimity and a kind of peacefulness that again Richard Davidson measures in his lab with Tibetan Lamas where they would set off, ah, you know a starting gun next to the ear of this Lama and they'd watch the brainwaves and nothing would happen. Yes, that sound registered in the Lama was still sitting there smiling, you know, and I think the reason people go to see the Dalai Lama actually isn't just that he has these beautiful teachings but I think that people go to see him in part because he carries the tragedy of Tibetan, the loss of their culture and all the things that have happened there and as a world figure it concerned for the environment in the globe they go to here and laugh. He has this incredibly wonderful, joyful laugh and they go to see somebody who is in the midst of amazing sorrows among other things in his life and still can have a joyful heart and as he said, you know, they have taken so much from us. They've burn the temples, they have taken our sacred text, they have taken our opportunity to practice and pracli-- practice our culture, why should I let them take my joy? And so, not only as there human pa-- pathology but there's a possibility of all this other developments, you know, in sort of sleep disorders and that one they would be lose a dreaming in the ways you work with your dreams. Uhm, instead of depression there would be, you know, uhm, the level of gladness in generosity where you walk through the world like Johnny Appleseed, you know, spreading goodwill among and all those things are possible. So this is the map of mental health and there are many different dimensions to it includes a training in the foundations of mindfulness that we talk about of breath and body, training of, ah, mindfulness of emotions and feelings, mindfulness of mind, of thoughts and its structures and stepping out of them, or replacing, mindfulness of relationships and don't think that it's just an individual act. This is from James Baldwin. "I imagine one of the reasons people cling to their hate and prejudice so stubbornly is they sense that once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with their pain." So if we can't deal with that in ourselves who projected on the communist, right, or the immigrants, or the Muslims or somebody who looks different because we can't fear our own insecurity, we can't fear our own vulnerability or our own measure of pain or tears and so, we don't wanna deal with it and its damn that's the cause of it. So it's a political act as well as an individual act and the obvious thing is that we know that no amount of computers and nanotechnology and biotechnology in the development of all these outer things is gonna stop continuing warfare and racism and environmental destruction as one of the joint chairman of the joint, chief of staff where nation of nuclear giants and ethical infants and what is necessary along with theses amazing outer developments is now a development of human consciousness of our interdependence, of compassion, of conflict resolution that's not based on war but a better game than war, some other way and we know out, ah, all your people you're not to deal with conflict you're warm with couples, you were well, okay, you sort of know how to deal with conflict with them anyway not in your marriage. I suppose speaking for myself but anyway, uhm, so it's harder, you know, it's easy to teach somebody else but nevertheless we have the tools as humanity and now is the time for us as psychologist and healers to take these tools to the level of humanity and policy. This is what has to be done so it's both in individual and a collective matter and the vision of mental health then it's not only in individual one but it's a collective one. Now, one of my favorite aspects of this vision of mental health is called the awakened heat and the awakened heart is four dimensions and then we'll do a practice. First dimension is a dimension of love which we did in that loving kindness practice, a sense of connectedness. Love is like gravity, it's so mysterious. I think we were all together that scientist call it a singularity before the Big Bang and then we flashed out and made the galaxies, uhm, and we kinda remember that we were all kind of the womb together, right? I'm a twin so I do remember that actually my twin brother. Uhm, but there is something as gravity itself is extraordinary. I mean, nobody understand we have equations for but what is it that this big bodies hold us on and pull at a distance. When I'm a kid I, I used to like to lie down on the grass on a starry night and look at the stars and imagine that I was on the bottom of the earth cuz there's no top or bottom, right? And that I'm being held on by gravity and I'm looking down into a sea of stars. It was a little scary but incredibly cool, right? This is amazing what we've been born into, this mystery. And love is the same as gravity. It is this connectedness that we have. Well, Alice Walker wrote it this way. She said, "One day when I was sitting there like a motherless child, which I was, it came to me: that feeling of being part of everything and I knew that if I cut a tree, my arm would bleed. And I laughed and I cried and I run all around the house. When it happen, you can't miss it." And you know it from walking the mountains and listening to sacred music and being at the birth of a child or taking some sacred substance or being there when someone-- the spirit lives their body and that silence like a falling star and the gates of the mystery open to you. You know, it as truly as, you know, your own name. And so the invitation of this love is the first dimension. The second dimension of the awakened heart is compassion. When love meets pain or difficulty its change its violence and it's not pity all that poor person over there but it's the quivering of the heart that says, "Yeah, here we are in our way." You know, it's the not shutting down but the willingness to be and the capacity and the beauty to be present with both what is magnificent and also was painful for another being, how poor ourselves and similarly when love meets well-being and happiness it turns into what in Sanskrit it's called mudita or shared joy. The joy of sharing capacities of well-being in life together. Kids know that when they start to play and then they start to giggle and laugh, you know, this our shared humanity. And then, when things are quite the love become still and it turns into an ocean of contentment or well-being or peace, a kind of equanimity that is vast and still that holds all things but that doesn't need anything and these are all nice words and they may resonate in different ways with you, we work a little bit talk about compassion or love and we will do something with joy before we leave. But I like us to do a practice that give-- that weaves together from where we started from the nobility and the inner dignity of each human being that gives you a sense of the depth of these teachings in this invitation and what this practice is that, that will do for 10, 15 minutes maybe, uhm, is a paired to practice in silence. Uhm, and its for some people its kind of demanding cuz we're shy people and that's okay. Uhm, but you're all therapist so you have tools to deal with it, ha-ha, he says right. Uhm, but it also has the opportunity to teach you something that's really rather profound. So what I'd like to ask is in silence if you would turn to somebody, scoot around a little bit so you have somebody-- you don't have to know them, it can be just somebody sitting to you. This is not dating, this is 10 minutes of a meditation and find somebody and if you don't have somebody stand up and raised your hand and look around in a circle for another hands. Stand up with your hand up and you'll find somebody. Put your hand up and stand up if you want a person. Shh-shh, quiet. Just, just be silent. I see hand up over here. Stand up with your hands up, you can do it. It won't hurt to stand up. I promise and look around in a circle and you'll somebody. Anybody still looking, raised your hand. Turn around in a circle. Still looking there is one person, okay, she's got a partner. All right. So this is gonna ask a certain both courage and, and tenderness of you but, you know, you paid all this money to come to Disneyland, right. You might as well take the ride not to speak of your human incarnation. All right, so sit for a moment quietly. Maybe even close your eyes staying silent and take a few deep breaths to center yourself and let go of any tension you carry. 

02:08:15
[sil.] 

02:08:20
JACK KORNFIELD And now when you're ready that your eyes opened and let yourself look into the eyes of the person, partner across from you and if you feel any discomfort or the urge to laugh or look away just note the embarrassment with patience and gentleness. Come back when you can to your partners eyes for you may never have the opportunity to see this person in this way again this unique human being in this moment. And now together we'll explore this four dimensions of the awakened heart. First is you look in this person's eyes. See behind these eyes another being with a beautiful spirit and exquisite heart. Open your awareness to the original goodness and the capacity for love that's behind these eyes. 

02:09:40
[sil.] 

02:09:45
JACK KORNFIELD Behind these eyes are gifts and strengths, unmeasured reserves of courage and intelligence, of patience, endurance, whim. 

02:10:05
[sil.] 

02:10:10
JACK KORNFIELD Think of their birth how delighted their parents probably were-- they are running around as a child. They're seeing the world doesn't unfolded. They still carry these gifts. Can you see the beautiful spirit behind these eyes? Become aware of the natural well-wishing that arises for them. 

02:10:40
[sil.] 

02:10:45
JACK KORNFIELD And as you see the spirit, the beauty behind these eyes know that what you now are experiencing is a great heart of loving kindness. It is so natural to us as human beings, resting it, trusting. 

02:11:15
[sil.] 

02:11:35
JACK KORNFIELD Now take a deep breath as you continue to look or two and let go of the loving kindness so you can look more deeply and in the second dimension of the awakened heart behind these eyes see as well the measure of sorrows that is there, the unknown pain. Let yourself become aware of the burdens carried. The sorrows accumulated in their life as in all human lives that you could only guess have. Their disappointments and failures, hurts beyond the telling, loneliness, lost, insecurity and setbacks. Let yourself open to their measure of sorrows to the pains this person may never have told another being. You cannot fix their pain but you can be with it with the spirit of courage. And imagine if they were a child frightened, hurt, how naturally your heart would reach out to comfort, hold them. And now that what you are experiencing now is a great heart of compassion. It is essential for the hearing of the worlds. 

02:13:35
[sil.] 

02:13:50
JACK KORNFIELD Trusting, rest in it. 

02:13:55
[sil.] 

02:14:05
JACK KORNFIELD And now again, with this tenderness take a couple of deep breaths and remain looking in the eyes of this person and let go of the compassion so you can see them anew with beginners minds and as you look deeply into the eyes of this person let yourself also see the measure of joy that is been given to them. Behind these eyes let yourself see their happiest moment as a young child, their best adventure, that je-- laughter and joy, the zest that was born into them. And feel what it would be like to laugh together, to take risk, to celebrate success, to see the marbles of the world, first time they saw a rainbow or the ocean, or cotton ball or fell in love and know that this is a being who carries the great wealth of joy and creativity and as you open to it, you open to mudita, the shared joy of life. Rest in it and enjoy it, celebrate it in silence. 

02:16:00
[sil.] 

02:16:25
JACK KORNFIELD And again, for the fourth time, take a couple of deep breaths and release the joy and remain connected to these eyes for the last dimension of the awakened heart and as you look to see the consciousness behind these eyes let your awareness drop deep like a stone sinking below the level of what words can touch to the deep web of consciousness itself. The web of consciousness in which you have taken birth. And as you see the consciousness behind these eyes, see these being before you as if seeing the face of one who at another time and place has been young... 

02:17:25
[sil.] 

02:17:30
JACK KORNFIELD And old, awake... 

02:17:40

JACK KORNFIELD Your teacher. 

02:19:00
[sil.] 

02:19:05
JACK KORNFIELD And now you meet in the brink of eternity and feel your lives woven in a web of consciousness from which you cannot fall. Who are you really? Rest in timeless awareness, trusting. It is your own true nature, it is home that would sees behind these eyes and that what you're seeing, who are you really? Not the body or the thoughts, not the roles or the small self. Rest in the unborn. Rest in the purest space of awareness, of loving awareness, trust it. Rest in your own. Buddha nature. It is home. 

02:20:10
[sil.] 

02:20:20
JACK KORNFIELD And know that meeting in this way seeing deeply that you can never forget who you really are, the secret beauty behind the eyes of every being in this trait. 

02:20:40
[sil.] 

02:20:50
JACK KORNFIELD May your eyes close gently. 

02:21:00
[sil.] 

02:21:30
JACK KORNFIELD And when you're ready let your eyes open and you can take a couple of minutes if there's any words you wish to say to this person you may never met them before but now, you know, them, you know, or maybe you live with somebody and you've never seen them like this. 

02:21:50
[sil.] 

02:24:20
JACK KORNFIELD So take just another minute or so to finish up I know you could talk with your new best friend for a while but finish up for now. 

02:24:35
[sil.]

JACK KORNFIELD Let yourself go back to where you're sitting. Maybe we'll take a couple of comments, uhm, there's, ah, standing like here in the middle in there. If anyone wants to share any part of how that was, uhm, I wanna say this before the people share that again it's really critical in this practices to see that they are practices and so they'd bring up everything and if you're shy it might been very difficult or might have felt quite artificial, uhm, and so you start to see that with loving awareness and then you say, all right that's here and what else is here. So it's not, uhm, that's why it's called practice and not perfect, right? So, at the same time, uhm, perhaps for some of you it was a way of seeing what we're talking about in the dimension that's not so normal for you.

02:26:00
JACK KORNFIELD So please go ahead. Ah, is that on? No? No. It's not on. Look into there's a speech on. 

02:26:05
UNKNOWN No. No. 

02:26:05
JACK KORNFIELD Okay, now you're on. Okay. 

02:26:10
UNKNOWN Now it's on. 

02:26:10
JACK KORNFIELD Uhm. 

02:26:10
UNKNOWN Can you hear me now? 

02:26:10
JACK KORNFIELD Yes, please. 

02:26:10
UNKNOWN As I say. Thank you, that was a extremely profound experience for both my partner and to myself and we just, we just tend to get up and hug each other afterward. I didn't see many people doing that maybe a few people did but it was just an amazing experience. Earlier I had-- I actually had plan to come up and say one comment about something you were talking about earlier to and that was when you talked about both aspects of life, positive, the negative, et cetera and it reminded me of when my wife passed away almost seven years ago and my adult daughter took a mindfulness class to help her deal with it and she came back and told me one day at dinner that she-- one of the most important thing she learned the praise, "Miracles happen, shit happens. It's a package deal."

02:27:55
UNKNOWN I'd like to share that so much emotion came up for me and that it felt so wonderful that my partner could, could be present with me and that know that tear that fell down on my eyes that, that I, I imagine a lot of change and expression on my face, I don't know what she saw but I saw in her the ability to be with me and to allow it and to just, just we share these waves between us and I thank her for allowing to, to, to express it all, naturally and automatically and, and it was beautiful.

02:28:35
UNKNOWN I'm shaking a little bit it was so intense, uhm, there was at peace... 

02:28:40
JACK KORNFIELD Hah! So first just with that for a moment, take a breath, let yourself shake. Good. Space, shaking, shaking. Yeah, lovely. 

02:28:50
UNKNOWN There was, uhm, we were going through that piece of compassion and I just got overwhelmed with this feeling of, of this loneliness of this-- is experiences that are so human that we all share and, uhm, and this comes out to me as a therapist just wanting to be there for them and just hold them with that. And then you shifted that into this joy. And we both started crying. It was just, uhm, as if wanting to share that joyful experience and all those, ah, amazing times that we have in our lives that the first time and it was just so powerful. And of course, we hugged afterward. I felt like we knew each other. Energy was so strong. 

02:29:35

02:29:35
JACK KORNFIELD You do know each other. 

02:29:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:29:40
JACK KORNFIELD You're just meeting again. You know, it's like this-- a friend of mine was in Seattle, uhm,-- she's in Salzburg actually and she was teaching and she was out of the street, uhm, and this homeless man came up to her, was looking for money, and looked to her and said, "Don't you know me?" And first, she sort of went through her files like all the-- keep pushing tolerate her trainer. And then she realized it wasn't that. It wasn't-- don't you know me because we've met at a, you know, mindfulness circuitry. It was don't you know me? You know, don't you know. And there's some way in which just what you said is beautiful that there's some way in which we-- it's such an honor to actually see it-- say it in the presence and no one other being. So a little bit more. Okay. Thank you for that. I know that that's not easy always, uhm, but it also is a kind of special gift. Uhm, in this, from the Associated Press in one of history's more unlikely acts of totalitarianism. The Chinese government in 2011 banned Buddhist monks in Tibet from reincarnating without government permission. According to the statement issued by the State Administration for Religious Affairs, the new law which way into effect in 2011 strictly stipulates the procedures by which one is to reincarnate and is "An important move to institutionalized management of reincarnation." Okay, so that's one way to handle humanity, our human life. But it's more than that as we know. A couple more a little of principles and maybe some little practice we'll see before we end . Is that okay? There's so many more we could, we could do. Uhm, one of the things that becomes important and it was said so beautifully by the, by the comment of the, the man whose wife died and what his daughter said, uhm, is that as you become more skilled in this capacity for presence mindfulness, loving, and awareness, you also become more comfortable with paradox that, uhm, in one way, you need to remember your Buddha nature as we what did and another you also have to remember your social security number and zip code, all right? And the both of those are true that universal in a particular, and I see if I can remember this poem from Mary Oliver where she wrote, uhm, "For years and years I struggled just to love my life." That's about half of therapy right there in one suffix. "For years and years I struggled just to love my life. And then the butterfly rose, weightless, in the wind. " Don't love your life too much," she said, and vanished into the world." And so this is what paradox T.S. Eliot writes in his poem, "Teach us to care and not to care. Teach us to sit still even among this rocks." And there is some way in which you are learning the vocabulary of emotion and communion and respect for the body and respect for relationship in teaching people, how to reinhabit themselves and then to reinhabit the planet in a different way and in another way you're also offering them the vastness that you just saw that we are part of the web of life that from which we can never fall and that trust that comes us, the Neruda poem. "You can pick all the flowers but you can't stop the Spring." There is some openness to life that pushes life through the cracks and the sidewalk that it is you that you are part of and that you can't lose or the-- so there's the development of self really important and then letting go of self in one side or the other becomes pathological but when you can hold the paradox and remember there was Time Magazine, uhm, issue on neuroscience and the full quote in the cover was a Modern Neuroscience said, "After more than a century of looking for it neuroscientist have long since concluded that there is no place in the brain where the self can be located, and that it simply does not exist," right? And this is true that identity the function in Buddha psychology, uhm, ah, there's a particular mental quality called, uhm, the creation of identity function and what it does is it clues consciousness to something and says, "This is me. I'm a woman. I'm a man. I'm a, you know, older. I'm young. I'm a republican or a liberal or libertarian." It creates identity but identity is actually completely fluid. And so, I can say this is me, my right hand and I can feel my left hand, you know, the fingernails are little long, you need to clip and this is the object, right, and I'm feeling it, okay. Or I can say, "This is me and now I feel the skin of this hand and oh, it's a little bit rough. I could use some, you know, body lotion or something like that. Now this is me and that the object," right? I can put my awareness to, to become my feeling or my beliefs. The capacity for identity is amazing. You just saw it there. You can identify with all these different things, the different roles that you're playing but who you really are is the space of awareness itself. Okay, a little experiment. Don't move but I want you to try something for a second. On the count of three, when I ask you to stop being aware. Do your best to not be aware. Okay, no awareness. You've grit your teeth, close your eyes, hold your do-- whatever you need to do, one, two, three. Stop. Stop it. Ha-ha. You can't do it, can you? So it becomes actually quite trustworthy. It's there. Rest, relax in the space of awareness that we were just gain in that paired and from that-- from the quality of loving kindness compassion that, that is natural to awareness, you begin to trust that you can navigate both with the universal perspective and the, and the, the, the individual gifts, the uniqueness that's given to you. So comfort with paradox, sophisticated understanding of self and no self and true self. Go read some of that Zen stuff, when you read it's wonderful. Kalu Rinpoche, great Tibetan Lama says, "You live in illusion and the appearance of things. There is a reality but you do not remember it. When you see clearly you will discover you are nothing, and being nothing, you are everything. That is all." There's a little kind of psychological summary of our human and again you just thought you are nothing in everything and then the, the wild thing is you get an incarnation and you get to play out this particular dance and you wanna do it beautifully cuz you get to plant seeds and this is where were headed toward the last two sets of our teachings. One on intention and on joy that the key, the key to well being and to living wisely in the world is to act with good intention and I'll talk about it in the minute to act well without attachment to the fruits of your action. This is the secret, you paid for it, right? You're gonna get the secret, the secret is to act well without attachment to the fruits of your actions cuz you don't actually get to choose the fruits, what you do is to get to choose your spirit like Nelson Mandela walking out of prison or Aung San Suu Kyi saying, "I was in for 17 years but I never hated them and so they never had me under arrest cuz I wouldn't let them imprisoned my heart." This from Thomas Merton, Christian mystic again, he writes, "Do not depend on the hope of results. You may have to face the fact that your work will be apparently worthless and achieve no result at all, if not perhaps bring about its opposite. As you understand this idea, you start more and more to concentrate not on the results, but on the value, the rightness and the truth of the work itself." And so, when you look into your heart in the Buddhist tradition people may distinction between short-term and long-term intentions but when you listen you can ask, "What's my best intention?" Suppose you're in a conversation in conflict, we'll go back to sue Johnson's thing or early this afternoon which I didn't go to but I know tiny bit about, uhm, or other such things, there you are in conflict, you stop, you take a breath, you don't have to be weird about it, trust in yourself and then you ask yourself, "What's my best intention? What's my highest intention?" Before you respond with some words which otherwise would be to show that you're right or depend yourself or prove somebody is wrong or before you press the send button on that text through that e-mail wait a second, "What's my best intention?" And in that moment if you listen your heart as well, "I was this to workout. I want us to figure out how it navigate this. How to, how to work or I wanna love this person. I want this," you-- you will see the intentions that comes is usually quite beautiful. And then, all of a sudden your tone of voice changes, you, you say what did you mean but you can say in two ways and say, "What did you mean?" You know, and you've kind of escalate or you can say, "What did you mean? I wanna understand." You get curious. You get open and they feel that. So short-term intention, checking in before you send the text, changes everything. And then, there's long-term intention which is like the Buddhist have to vow, the Dalai Lama wakes up in the morning and he says from Shantideva's poetry, "May I be bridge, a boat, a raft for those who cross the flood. May I be medicine for the sick and food for the hungry. May I be a resting place for the weary. May I be a lamp for those in the darkness and may I be an inspiration for beings everywhere as long as earth and sky and galaxy is exist until we all awakened together." Some little prayer like that, right. Uhm, but if you get quite you can also said the compose of your heart and say, "What do I wanna dedicate myself to in this life?" Diane Ackerman here a wonderful poet. She writes, "In the name of the daybreak and the eyelids of morning and the wayfaring moon and the night when it departs, I swear I will not dishonor my soul with hatred, but offer myself humbly as a guardian of nature, as a healer of misery, a messenger of wonder and an architect of peace." And if you invite yourself as I do now for just 30 seconds to be quiet or someone that you work with who is in struggle to be quite and think, "Well, what is my-- what is my deep intention? How do I wanna navigate this beautiful mysterious, difficult tragic, wondrous incarnation?" Maybe it's just as simple to say, "I wanna be kind." What would it be for you? What's your intention?

JACK KORNFIELD The thing is that nobody has ever live your life before in this whole vast universe of now we're learning billions of new planets and zillions of galaxies. I think it's why that really is, look out there and yet, in the whole panoply of galaxies you're never been a being exactly like you. So you gonna find your way and the guide star as your intention and people say, "Well, what about, you know, misguided intentions?" You know, the road to hell pay with good intentions. Those are called intentions mixed with ignorance or delusion, you know, so you really wanna look to see with clarity what is the basis of this intention and nobody can tell you really with, ah, Somerset Maugham, you know, the great English author. He said, "There are three rules for writing the great English novel. Unfortunately, no one knows what they are." Right, and this the situation you're in. You urge brail. You have the-- and the place to listen is to let yourself get quite and listen in your heart what is your best intention and to teach others and then, the last thing to say has to do with joy because if you can't also find joy the-- again, you wanna look at the Buddhist psychology list, the 25 kinds of rapture and joy, thrilling joy, openhearted joy, the body filled with light joy, you know, dancing joy, trembling joy, anyway, and there's a way to second. The world and if I learned anything here or something really touched me in this conference it's-- I'm sort of repeating what I said before, it's not that we lack to understanding collectively of how to confront conflict or, or trauma or difficulty but that-- what's needed now is a collective will is not just public policy but a really transformation of human consciousness. You say, "Well, what-- why I'm not feeling joy when the species are dying?" You know, I mean, you to put their pictures on the milk cartons like endangered, you know, children who are lost what about, ah, rhinos and what about, ah, orangutan, you know, or how do we feel joy with what's happening in Central African Republic, you know, or Darfur or-- it doesn't matter I can name a hundred places, some of them not very many miles from here, right. So I read you a really tough poem that is also one of the best poems that I know in recent decades from Jack Gilbert, a great American poet called A Brief for the Defense for the lawyers among you. My daughter is-- just graduated from Berkeley Law School doing Human Rights Law so I'm kind of problem papa. Anyway, "A Brief for the Defense. Sorrow everywhere. Slaughter everywhere. If babies are not starving someplace, they are starving somewhere else. With flies in their nostrils. But we enjoy our lives because that's what God wants. Otherwise the mornings before a lavender summer dawn would not be made so fine. And the Bengal tiger would not be fashioned so miraculously well with the orange and black stripes. The poor women at the fountain are laughing together between the suffering they have known and the awfulness in their future, smiling and laughing while somebody in the village is very sick. If we deny our happiness, resist our satisfaction, we lessen the importance of their deprivation. We must risk delight. We can do without pleasure, but not delight. Not enjoyment. We must have the stubbornness to accept our gladness in the ruthless furnace of this world. To make injustice the only measure of our attention is to praise the Devil." What a line? "To make injustice the only measure of our attention is to praise the Devil. If the locomotive of the Lord runs us down, we should give thanks that the end had magnitude. We must admit that there will be music despite everything. We must risk delight, we have the stubbornness to accept out gladness in the ruthless furnace of this world." And so, here is the instructions from the Buddha, "Live in joy and love even among those who hate; live in joy and peace even among the troubled. Live in joy even among the afflicted. Look within. Be still. Free from fear and attachment, know the sweet joy of the way." And this is really an invitation to a shift of consciousness and being that doesn't take on the sufferings of the people that you work with or of the world that bears witness to it in, uhm, truly honorable way that's there as the brother and sister but that doesn't drowned cuz it doesn't help them, it doesn't help anybody and there's the laughter of the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Tutu, you know, who has an amazing laugh after all they've been through and this is what's invited to you. We have a project in San Quentin Prison. Don't get me started on prisons. The default mental hospitals the, the racist poverty prisons where we lack up all these young people, it's crazy but we have a prison project and one of the guys on death row Jarvis Masters who's, ah, now a Buddhist practitioner he took Buddhist after vows Vitarka and Vajrayāna practicing for a long time. He was out on the yard one day and the yard at San Quentin is a really bizarre scene because there is the concertina, razor wire and a fences and the guards in their tower with automatic weapons and right through the channeling fence are sail boats and wind surfers and San Francisco Bay it's the most amazing beautiful piece of real estate in Mount Tamalpais and then precinct you know, it's sort of distract to position. So they're out there in the winter and, and it did rain that there were panels in the yard, guys are out there and a seagull lands in one of the panels and one of the young guys neasr Jarvis picks up a big rock to throw it at the seagull and if you don't understand then you haven't been hanging around with young men and, you know, recently cuz they hunt and they, you know, whatever, uhm, and Jarvis Buddhist, after the vows, sticks out his arm, "Stop that. Don't kill that." And the guy shouts, "What you're doing?" And the whole yard get silent like you don't mess with people's personal space and prison, people working out and big and tattooed whatever, "What's your doing?" The yard gets silent like some is gonna come down, right. And Jarvis turns and looks to him and says, "That bird got my wings." And the guy says, "Huh?" You know, if you're really in a difficult situation say something politely crazy and off the wall wacky, "Huh?" That bird got my wing isn't gonna lowers the rock. "What are you talking about?" Jarvis gets out the rock goes down and for a couple of weeks after that people on the cell blocks would come up to Jarvis and they would say, "What do you mean, that bird got my wings like some colon, right?" And Jarvis would just smile not say anything but they knew and, you know, you know that no matter what circumstance the human being is in, the human spirit is enviable and its there to be found, you know, in yourself and in another and that bird got my wings would use that statement that everybody knew what that meant, you know, that that's true. So school principal used to like to make sandwiches for homeless people, for school down on the tenderloin lots of people on the street who were hungry and so several days after a week if she wasn't tired she gets him cheese, you know, baloney whatever, food she could make a bunch of sandwiches, uhm, whatever she cooked up chicken, put in the sandwich and go down to distribute it cuz people are hungry she had food and she didn't care if they thank or they didn't. She wasn't doing cuz it was, you know, the right thing to get praise about it just they were hungry. Such simple really. Someone is thirsty you give them water. After some time the local media found out about it and she became a kind of minor celebrity in her area and inspired by her work other teachers and colleagues began to send her money for her ministry. To their surprise they all received their money with a short note that read, "Make your own damn sandwiches."

JACK KORNFIELD Practices of mindfulness of breath and body. Mindfulness is a feelings vowing to acknowledging the ocean of tears, the joy that's carried the unfinished business of the heart becoming the space of loving awareness that can witness that. They can see the play of thoughts and that also see the thoughts that don't have your best interest in mind that can replace them with thoughts of love or compassion or just vow to them and say, "Thank you for your opinion" not identify with them. Practices of walking meditation which we didn't do but you can read about just ways it come back into your body. Trainings of forgiveness which we did. Loving kindness of compassion. These are just the beginnings of this offering of what is possible for us of human beings to shift from the model of pathology to the model-- the inclusive model that includes necessary healing in trauma and then moves us to this capacity of profound well-being. They are in your good hands, in your good heart, your own Buddha nature knows, you know, that bird got my wings. That's your bird, baby, you know. And so, I thank you for your kind attention and your willingness to go along. It's an honor to be here. Thank you, thank you. Take this, use them, offer them to others. Thank you. And I have-- I have to say also that I have to get stuff together and go take a plane in a, in a few minutes so I'm not gonna be up here for more than a few minutes. Thank you have a wonderful.
