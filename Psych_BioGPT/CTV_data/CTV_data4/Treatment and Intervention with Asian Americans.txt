"Treatment and Intervention, with Asian Americans" - Nolan Zane, Ph.D. 

00:00:20
NOLAN ZANE Thank you, Fred. Good morning everyone. One slight correction to Fred's announcement is I direct the Asian American Center on Disparities, not for disparities. Some people, after they look at our work, think we are "for disparities." But, we are "on" disparities. Today, I want to give you a review of some of the research that relates to treatment for Asian American's. But, also, really focus a lot on...I think we have, as you can tell from a lot of the excellent presentations yesterday, that we have a lot of work to do. So, a lot of my presentation will be focused on some of the issues that continue to challenge us in developing culturally informed, culturally nuanced, culturally competent therapies and treatments for ethnic minority clientele. 

00:01:25
Mental Health Disparities 

00:01:25
NOLAN ZANE So, clearly, with respect to disparities, we know two major facts. First, is that much of the ration in ethnic disparities has really nothing to do with differential rates in pathology, but more to do with inaccessible care and ineffective treatment. And, this is really one of the issues that concerns us, is that despite a lot of the very interesting, actually very excellent research in the last few decades, is that disparities still fairly exist, to some extent, to great extent actually. This is especially true of many immigrant populations such as Asian Americans. In the terms that Asian Americans have a long pattern, and consistent pattern of under utilization of mental health, especially mental health services. As well as when they go into treatment they don't do very well. Their experiences are more negative in terms of treatment outcomes. One of the presenters referred to the Mack (ph) study, and so that's a really important study in terms of where are we in terms of the research today. And, so, Winnie Mak, who's a former student of mine, reviewed studies from about 379 clinical trials. These are NIMH funded clinical trials, and the period of review was '95 to 2004, and in five leading journals, mental health journals and psychology journals. And, they found that half the studies provided information on specific ethnic composition of their samples. So, in other words, even when the clinical trial was, and we have the NIMH directive to include representing samples of minority women and children. Even with that directive when we look at the current clinical trials, only half of them have any information at all, which is quite alarming, on what the ethnic composition of the sample is. And, what is more important is when they actually looked at what ethnic minority were being sampled, they found under representation of particularly Asian Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans. So, we see that even when there's information on these samples, usually the samples are fairly small. And, really when you look at the data there's not that you make from many of these clinical trials. And, Whites constitute over three fifths of the samples still in our studies. 

00:04:15
Problems in Access to Care 

00:04:15
NOLAN ZANE So, when we look at Asian Americans...and when I was a...let's see, I've been in the field for a long time, but some time ago I was contacted by a pharmaceutical company. A very interesting contact, and they said, "we're really interested in marketing to Asian Americans, and we want to know how do we sell our drugs to Asian Americans?" First, I was thinking that maybe they had heard about my past in college or something, you know? But, so I was getting a paranoid, and then I realized that can't be the case. So, I asked them why? And, they said "well, all the literature shows that Asian Americans under utilize services. Mental health and also health services." So, this disparity is clearly in health. Their supposition was that Asians aren't going to medical services, they must be self medicating. So, they were really going to try to flood the market with marketing for these communities. So, when we look at this pattern, we see for example, Wayne Meyer and some of our Center staff conducted a study using the M.S. dataset. And, we were interested in looking at people who clearly needed mental health services. So, in other words, based on the M.S. diagnostic criteria, these are people who would be called case ( inaudible). In other words, they clearly were a case in which they were diagnosed with some type of mental health disorder. And, they found that Asian Americans, only about 28 percent of Asian Americans in the sample, who had a mental health disorder actually used mental health services. Compared to 54 percent in the general population. So, when a person has a mental health disorder in the general population, about half of those will use at least one session of mental health treatment. So, clearly there's under utilization of Asians, but this is clearly more applicable to the immigrant subpopulation of Asians in which half of the...in other words immigrants used services at half the rate that we saw for U.S. foreign citizens. Forty percent of the immigrants who had a mental health disorder used mental health services, versus...I'm sorry, 40 percent of U.S. foreign individuals who had a mental health disorder used services, versus 25 percent. Twenty-three percent of the immigrant subpopulation of Asians, and interestingly when we looked at English speaking proficiency. One of the things that researchers are now looking at here, is not simply ethnicity, you know, given Joe's and other scholars in terms of noting that there's ethnic gloss (ph), but looking at aspects of ethnicity. In other words, what really maps (ph) onto ethnicity? Such as, English speaking ability, and when you look at English speaking ability in this study, you find that it actually interacts with the use of mental health services in terms of who uses other types of services, and whether that's related to mental health service use. So, as you can see that when you have lower levels of English speaking clients who have low proficiency in English, that the use of alternative services is negatively related to mental health use. In other words, it seems that these people are using alternative services in lieu of mental health treatment. But, when you have a higher English speaking Asian clientele, that actually the use of alternative services is positively related to mental health service use. So, clearly we need to know more, have more nuance and information about our clientele. In this case, Asian Americans. 

00:08:25
Problems in Quality, of Mental Health Care 

00:08:25
NOLAN ZANE But, also, in terms of the other disparity, we have evidence that there's disparities in terms of quality of care. So, my colleagues and I did a study in which we actually looked at mental health outcomes after short term treatment, of Asian American and White clients. The reason why we looked at the short-term treatment is because we know that Asians not only use services at a lower rate, but also they tend to stay in treatment for a much shorter period of time. So, we looked at short-term treatment and found that even after four sessions, so this only four sessions of treatment, that Asian American clients were less... these are patients now, outpatients, were less satisfied with terms of their experience. Less satisfied with their therapist, less satisfied with their treatment progress. Less satisfied with the overall service they received. Less satisfied with access to services, and less satisfied with the service fee. And, also, in terms of symptomatology after four sessions, Asian Americans were more depressed, more anxious and actually reported more hostility or anger after four sessions of treatment. They were rated by their therapists as functioning at a lower level psychosocially than White clients. So, again, we have these major disparities. And, this is one thing I want to note very quickly, is that in some of our most research has suggested that there's another mental health problem that's increasing particularly in Asian American peoples. This is probably one of the few mental health problems in which you see a high prevalence rate of Asian American having this problem, than with respect to other mental health problems. Because, when you look at the M.S. studies, actually Asians tend to have a lower rate of anxiety disorders, lower rates of depression than the general population. But, in our studies of emerging adults, what we find is that Asian Americans tend to have higher rates of this problem, which is gambling. 

00:10:45
An Increasing Problem in AA, Communities: Gambling 

00:10:45
NOLAN ZANE When we were doing some of our earlier studies a few decades ago, the clinicians were saying, "yeah, mental health problems are a problem, substance abuse is a problem, gang involvement is a problem." But, the big problem is gambling in our communities, and so some of our recent research is showing that this is definitely the case. There were no... when we look at gambling, in terms of who gambles, there were no differences in the engagement of gambling. In other words, who has actually gambled in their life. About 54 percent of Asians versus 52 percent of White Americans gambled. White American emerging adults. But, about half of the Asians gamblers were problem gamblers, compared to close to a quarter of the White gamblers. So, that... and, clearly this is also a perception in the community. So, when we go... so, what we try to do is not only look at studies that look at and yield formal mental health data, but also what is the perception. What is going on in these communities? And, when we look at that, one of the largest Asian communities in the United States was surveyed. A small area survey, and they found that and they asked this question, "what's the most important problem that you have in your communities?" They expected that people would actually talk about gang involvement, because there was actually a study that was funded to look at gang involvement and domestic violence. And, so, they did find that gang involvement was listed as a problem by close to two-thirds of the sample, and domestic violence for about half of the sample. But, clearly about 70 percent of the respondents indicated that gambling was a problem, a major problem, in their communities. This study has been replicated in other Asian communities. Another one in another in California found basically similar results. So, we not only have data based on community perceptions and community views, and we see that this is becoming a major problem. For example, in Sacramento, you can drive for less than an hour and you can get to three big casinos the size of a Las Vegas casino, within less than one hour. I know, I've done it. I'm going to preempt Fred's many comments about my gambling habits. The best defense is a good offense. So, clearly, there's these other disparities that are now coming up on the horizon Asian American communities. One of the problems is that we have so little...wait, so when we look at how the field has tried to address this issue of the lack of cultural nuances and culturally informed treatments, is that the primary response has been the development of culturally adapted treatments. 

00:14:05
Challenges to Culturally Informed, Mental Health Care & Treatment 

00:14:05
NOLAN ZANE I'm going to share with you some of the results from a recent review that we did in a few minutes. But, what we see is that the field has really created a very creative array of culturally informed interventions. But, it's still in question as how effective these treatments are, and actually if they're more effective than non-culturally adapted treatments as some of the main analyses suggests. But, this is another concern that we have, because particularly when talk about Asian American communities. Because, one, as you will see when we go to the cultural adaptation data, there's very little research being done even in this area on Asian Americans. So, the adaptations have trended away from any systematic framework or strategy to guide the development and refinement of the treatment. Now, we're just writing up a study where we had in depth interviews of 30 clinicians who practice in the Southern California region, who are in the public mental health system. And, we picked these clinicians for these in depth interviews. Over 30 percent of their cases had to be culturally diverse clientele. They had to have at least five years of clinical experience, and they had to have worked in a mental health system for at least 10 years. So, in other words, as an intern or post-op, whatever. When we look at these clinicians, and we asked them issues about how do they try to adapt, refine, change their treatment approach to service, provide competent services, and culturally responsive services to ethnic minorities and culturally diverse clientele. Obviously, you know, given the in depth interviews, there's a lot of interesting and rich information, but one theme kept coming out. A very sobering one. One theme was that they felt a lot of pressure from State Mental Health and County Mental Health officials, and administrators and managers, to provide culturally competent care. The second one, is they clearly believed in culturally competent care. The third one is the sobering one, they didn't know how to do culturally competent care. And, the fourth one, was that they were, as one clinician put aptly in her comments, "I'm really sick and tired of hearing these researchers talk about disparities, and not telling me what to do about it." So, one of the things that we've noticed in the adaptations is that the adaptations have been very creative, but there's very few researchers that follow the systematic framework for actually guiding how you go about doing culturally valid, or culturally nuanced, or culturally informed care. There is another concern of ours, and that is there seems to be an empirical disconnect between some of the foci of the adaptations, and the major processes that psychotherapy research has found to be related to treatment outcomes. And, another issue that seems to now be confronting us, is that usually when there's an adaptation, or a person supposedly develops a new treatment for ethnic minorities or culturally diverse clientele, the person says that it's culturally appropriate. The pronounce in the publication, through focus groups, etc., that they have found information that would suggest it's culturally appropriate, and they explain their rationale. So, they layout a rationale. But, being social scientists, the question is "where's the meat?" In other words, how do we know it's really culturally significant? So, how do we know it's really culturally valid? So, about three decades ago, clinicians were really starting to ask, "well, just because something's statistically significant, does it make it clinically important?" So, the notion and the concept of clinical significance came up, in that "yes, you have a treatment change that is reliable." In other words, statistically we're more confident that it will occur not simply do to chance. So, it's reliable, it's a reliable change. But, now, we want the change to be meaningful. Significantly and clinically meaningful. What we're suggesting is that we need to raise the bar a bit even more when we're talking about cultural competence and cultural interventions. And, that is, we need to test for the cultural significance of an intervention. 

00:19:25
Testing the Cultural Significance, of an Intervention 

00:19:30
NOLAN ZANE In other words, how do we know that a treatment is really truly culturally syntonic? Do we just simply accept, in other words, the pronouncement of the researcher that it was done through certain focus groups etc. Or, how can we actually test this? In other words, as Bernal and his colleagues said, "how do we know it's ecologically valid?" Or, as we would say, culturally significant? Well, there actually are methods that have been developed, in which we can actually provide data concerning the cultural significance of an intervention. Kazdin, as far back as the 1970's, suggested that a treatment approach has to be socially valid, which is very similar when you look at how he defined social validity, to what we're referring to as cultural significance. And, he suggests that the focus of the treatment, in other words what the treatment focuses on, has to be socially important to that clientele. The procedures of the treatment has to be socially acceptable to that clientele. And, finally the outcomes. The procedures and methods has to be socially acceptable to that clientele, and finally the outcomes. In other words, what we actually use in terms of criteria to gauge treatment change, as well as treatment improvement, has to be socially valuable to that clientele. So, evidence of these types of acceptability's should be present Kazdin wrote. When you look even at Kazdin's studies, he doesn't provide that data. So, there seems to be at least some mechanism to address this issue of cultural significance. But, Gallimore and his colleagues have also suggested a framework that we can sort of view this whole notion. So, when people say it's culturally appropriate, when people say it's culturally syntonic, when they say it's it culturally matches that of something of the client, what do they mean? And, how do we really conceptually understand it? Well, Gallimore suggests that we conduct our activities in activity settings. In other words, all of our daily activities, including psychotherapy, go and are essentially situated in an activity setting. What he was interested in was the activity settings that people use to learn in their families, and he was studying Pacific Islander's to use mixed methods to study whether these activity settings were similar in form and function to the activity settings the Pacific Islander kids would encounter when they would go to school. And, what he found was that when the activity settings were similar between the family and the school, the kids tended to do fairly well. When the activity settings were different, the kids tended to not do very well at all. So, we're sort of borrowing this notion for something to be culturally syntonic, culturally matching, or culturally appropriate, that the behavior that you're adapting, or the process that you're adapting has to be similar in form and function to what goes on in those communities and in those families. So, for example, an example that I like to use is when we try to get our clients to open up to us, you know self disclose, clearly self disclosure is a critical process in psychotherapy. Dr. Breeland (ph) talked about engaging clients, and clearly one of the important processes in the engagement clients is to get them to tell you what's really bothering them, right? And, when ask clients to sort of open up, to self disclose, is the process of self disclosure isomorphic, as Gallimore suggests, between self disclosure as practiced in psychotherapy, versus self disclosure as practiced in the home or in the communities? His contention would be that if you make it isomorphic, you would tend to get better outcomes. I'm not saying that we should use this concept or notion of fit, or match, or cultural appropriateness blindly. I think my point here is that we need to think more deeply about what we mean by cultural appropriateness, cultural sensitivity, etc. and be able to really explain it. It all goes back to that clinicians comment. It's that, "I do not know what to do in psychotherapy. I know it's important to treat African American, Latino, Asian clients in a culturally sensitive way. It's really difficult for me to actually determine that." So, what we suggested is perhaps the field should go so that adaptations and other attempts to develop culturally appropriate treatments, that they look at some alternative ways to go about doing business. 

00:25:05
Critical Process Approach to, Cultural Issues in Treatment 

00:25:05
NOLAN ZANE And, one of them is Dr. Lopez, who is here with us today. He and Betancourt made an excellent point in that culture maps onto to these specific psychological elements or factors that may influence treatment and other behaviors. In our work, we're looking at stigma, face concerns and self-construal's. So, we're sort of deconstructing culture into these very specific constructs. People have been doing this for years, but one of the things is that are these constructs really related to important processes? In other words, do these variables that these constructs have and represent, do they actually affect an important process in treatment? Our contention is that these factors, when you deconstruct any culture into a number of different constructs, that they: one, have to be related to the cultural experience of the client, that's obvious, we've all known that. But, they also have to be tied, empirically, to critical processes in treatment, such as self disclosure, working lines, engaging the client and working with the client, credibility. Because, we know that these processes are tied empirically. We know that these processes are tied to positive outcomes in treatment. Now, we are making assumptions that for culturally diverse clientele, that these relationships are generalizable in the culturally diverse clientele. So, that's a big assumption that I have to admit that we're making. It's that most of the research on processes and treatment outcomes are still based primarily on White samples. So, are these culture variations that we're addressing tied to critical processes in treatment? And, when we apply these, this allows us to do several things. One, it allows us to be grounded in a lot of what we know empirically about treatment. The other important thing is that when we look at these constructs, is now we can get past the ethnic gloss. Because, we can still say that this construct, like face concern, maybe more salient to Asian American patients, but we don't have to accept the assumption that all Asian patients are concerned about face because it's a construct. So, Asians can vary and many of them, on the average, will be concerned about face than Whites. Now, in our studies, we've done countless (ph) studies using the face measure, other people have used it in Korea, China and across the United States. And, I can't think of one study where Asian Americans, regardless of where they are in the United States, had a lower mean, or non-significantly different mean on face concern than Whites. So, in other words, this is a very salient construct, and one that's really consistent in terms of finding cultural variations. I don't have time, but one of the things we're looking at is are we studying the appropriate cultural variables? When Betancourt and Lopez talk about psychologic elements might bring on this culture, obviously hundreds, thousands of these elements map onto cultural variations. The question is, are some of these cultural variations marketing us? In other words, large enough in terms of effect sizes to really be clinically important for us to study? I think that sometimes, we're making a big deal of sometimes focusing on variables that may not have as much cultural variances as we think they do. Some people have talked about individual collectivism being good. A good one is that in certain samples, people really don't differ that much on individualism. Because, individualism is so adaptive in the United States that for people to survive in the United States, they have to be individualistic. A big variance tends to be more on interdependence and collectivism. So, what we want to do when we look at these cultural adaptations is do they address these critical processes in treatment? 

00:29:55
Studies of Cultural Adaptations 

00:30:00
NOLAN ZANE So, first we looked at just the studies that looked at cultural adaptations on ethnic minority populations in the United States. So, we didn't go outside the United States. So far we've come up with the fact that these are how the adaptation studies are clustered across the four ethnic groups. Now, you notice that for Asian Americans, we only have seven studies on adaptations. Most of the work is being done, and many of these people are in this room, most of the adaptation work is being done on Latino populations. So, to sort of give our analysis more substance, we started to look at the immigrant populations, Latinos and Asian Americans and see where the adaptations fall. Now, keep in mind that when a person adapts to treatment, they don't just do one adaptation. They usually do, as you will see, more than one. But, the question is, where do these adaptations fall in terms of these critical processes? 

00:31:00
Results of Adaptation Analysis 

00:31:05
NOLAN ZANE So, these are the results. So, first of all, you can see that...if you're interested in what we're doing, I'd be happy to talk to about it later, because we're running a bit short on time. But, when you look at adaptations, the top two that come out are mostly on education and information, and the use of appropriate use of language and metaphors. Which, some people say are more superficial forms of adaptations. Now, remember, this is for Asian Americans and Latino Americans. On the average, when you look at the adaptation studies, the average number of adaptations made in study is about 5. In terms of our coding scheme. So, notice these are not by studies, these are just the number of adaptations and where they're concentrated on. So, remember these are all the different critical processes that have been identified by psychotherapy researchers such as: eliciting self disclosure, you notice that zero adaptations were made for Asian Americans. This is surprising given all the countless articles that occur in Fred's multicultural handbooks talking about face and stigma, and how Asians don't like to talk or consider mental health problems, is that zero adaptations were made on self disclosure for Asians and three for Latino Americans. So, when you look at the adaptations, there's several patterns that emerge. This is a very small sample, because remember we're not done with our analysis and we have to finish the coding of the adaptations made for African Americans and for Native Americans. But, at least in preliminary you can see that the adaptations are all over the place. In other words, people are adapting to different things. So, it's not surprising that clinicians find it very befuddling, very difficult and very challenging to essentially adapt their treatment approaches to service ethnic minority culturally diverse clientele. 

00:33:05
Results of Adaptation Analysis 

00:33:05
NOLAN ZANE But, this is the other thing that we found, is that these are the adaptations that had one or, excuse me, these are all the critical processes that had one or zero adaptations. 

00:33:20
[sil.] 

00:33:25
NOLAN ZANE Now, this could be because clearly we don't have enough research in the area. That's why I think Dr. Breelan's charge to you all to really pursue disparities research, is an excellent one. We clearly need a greater mass of researchers. But, also notice there's some pretty important... like Jerome Frank talks about the first stage of psychotherapy should be to instill hope and to combat demoralization on the part of our clients. None, or only one of the adaptations actually focus on cultivating hope and instilling enhancing expectations. So, it seems that a number of processes could also be addressed in many of these adaptations that are not being addressed at this time. 

00:34:10
Client Predictors of Short-term, Psychotherapy Outcomes 

00:34:15
NOLAN ZANE I'm going to quickly go over this study. So, there are indications that there are some of these processes and ethnic differences which are related to outcomes. We did a study, again a psychotherapy study, looking at a diverse sample of Asian and White Americans. Interesting that there was White American patients. So, this goes back into the... they were mostly Russian immigrants. Many of our ethnic comparisons that we expected, well, we didn't expect them because they were Russian immigrants, so didn't think that we would find that many ethnic differences in outcomes. Which, we didn't. But, we did find when we looked at coping style, treatment credibility and differential expressions of distress, in other words whether a person tended to present with somatic symptoms. Somatic symptoms were predictive of lower psychosocial functions. It's actually not predictive, it's a perspective study. Also, for negative symptoms, and for psychological discomfort, avoiding coping styles was predictive of those outcomes after short-term treatment. 

00:35:35
Client Characteristic Predictors of, Treatment Outcome 

00:35:35
NOLAN ZANE This is more interesting, when we looked at clients in terms of their preference for English. And, remember this is a fairly diverse sample of not only Asian American patients, but also White American patients, Russian immigrants. It's that non-English preference, in other words when they prefer to speak in another language other than English, was related to negative symptoms and related to psychological discomfort. But, what mediated was avoiding coping styles. So, there clearly seems to be some ethnic variations that are related to differential outcomes and treatment. Many of you have heard me go on and on about face, I'm not going to go into the nuances of face. But, it suffices to say that where defining faces, the person's claim to their social integrity, and that this set of claims is sort of what Gothman (ph) calls the "line" that people make of themselves. But, their face is maintained largely in part by carrying out prescribed roles that are considered important for that person in their cultural position, in a particular society. 

00:36:50
Match and Face Effects, on Self-Disclosure 

00:36:50
NOLAN ZANE So, when we look at face, and face concerns, we wanted to look at whether it was related to critical processes in self disclosure. We also looked at ethnic match, gender match and face concern, and acculturation. And, we found that gender match was related to self disclosure about one's sex life, which is actually expected. But, notice that face was one of the more consistent correlates of self disclosure about personal values and feelings, sex life and private habits, and very importantly, close relationships. In all the...there's a typo. There's a typo there on the last two. These are all negative relationships, so the more you're concerned about face, the less likely you are to self disclose. But, also acculturation was related to self disclosure, but it was mediated by face concern. So, I'm going to close by talking about that these are interesting findings, but what do they mean clinically? Well, for clinicians, I think this is very important. One useful way to go is that when we look at the implications of some of the work on face, is that yes, Asian Americans maybe more concerned about face. But, as that clinician said, "well, what do I do about it?" So, what we're doing now is that we're looking at what actually is related to people who are highly concerned about face. 

00:38:25
FACE WORK, Avoidance of Threats to Face 

00:38:30
NOLAN ZANE The research shows on face that they tend to show a number of different behaviors. In other words, the use of respect, politeness and explanations and warnings to depersonalize a face threatening incident, denial or not recognizing, and so on. So, notice that now we don't have to assume that Asian Americans are concerned about face, but that we actually have behavioral markers for face concern. There was just a recent study in Clinical Science that found that when clients were coded in terms of their non-verbal behavior for shame. That actually shame was predictive of relapse amongst substance abuse addicts. So, clearly, we can now look at individual variations. We can hypothesize that many Asians maybe concerned about face. But, now we can actually look for behavioral markers, and as clinicians we can see whether this is actually the case. But, the other thing is what do you do about it? 

00:39:25
Corrective (Ritual) Process to, Restore Social Equilibrium 

00:39:25
NOLAN ZANE We've written about how psychotherapy is basically a face and shame based process. When people go in, they have to talk about their problems, their failures, their frustrations. Everything in terms of how they screwed up in life, right? So, there's a lot of face loss. So, now what we're doing is we're looking at how people manage and help people restore face. My contention is that, in our training programs, we're terrible and we do a very poor job of teaching our therapists how to help our clients restore face. It's not surprising that many clinicians once they go out and practice in the field, they may recognize there's an issue with their clients, but many times they don't know how to remediate it. Goffman years ago talked about how there's a face saving process. We don't have time to go through it, but basically it's a ritual that clients go through to essentially maintain and restore face once they've lost it. What we're doing is we're studying people who we think are naturally good at helping people restore face. So, now we're going outside of mental health and we're studying people who are mediators, who do this for a life. So, we're actually studying what a good mediator actually does. Because, when you look at how people mediate, like in labor relations, many times they don't change the conditions. They simply create face saving ways for the manager to go back to his workers and say, "we got this for you." And, for the CEO to go back to his board and say, "we got this for you." So, they don't change the conditions that much. They do change the situation to save face. So, these are some of the ways that are clearly challenging us. I think if we start looking more at these critical processes, we start nuancing our treatments to really address many of these constructs, that, one, we can get beyond ethnic loss and sort of more towards the business of what we're all interested in. Which, is to provide culturally informed and culturally nuanced mental health care. Thank you.
