ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember, the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do their best in their trauma recovery. Choose a short time everyday to build the right skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is using your clever mind to challenge stressful thoughts. We all have moments of stress and sometimes if we can catch the feelings at the early stage, then we can set… we can send a corrective message that keeps us from feeling panic and complete overwhelmed or posttraumatic responses. Let's practice together. First, let's consider an old quote by Mark Twain. "I've heard a great many troubles, but most of them never happened." How perfectly true. When we experience trauma, we can forget how truly where terrible events can be and continue to project the past event into the present and the future, creating many moments of fear. So, challenging the fearful thoughts using the power of our minds is key. Second, challenge is, “If I let myself slow down and reflect, I can figure out the best solution to this, whatever the problem is and even if the solution is that it is out of my control and I can work on letting go.” Start with, “I can slow down now.” Reflect and figure out solutions. ”If I am calm, I can figure this out.” Third challenge is, ”I can get out of the worry about the future, or fearful thoughts about the past, and be in this moment right now. This is where all of my ability to find practical solutions, power and control here’s anyways.” So, the practice is for you to notice early warning signs of stress before they become the all bells and whistles alarm and to (inaudible ). Remind yourself that you are in this moment, not the past or in the fearful anticipated future and trust that you can in state of calm figure out the next step. Practice this again throughout the day whatever you need to recapture the feelings, comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky, from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember, daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
