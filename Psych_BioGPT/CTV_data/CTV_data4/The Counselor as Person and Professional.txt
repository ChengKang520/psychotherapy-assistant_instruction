Ladies and gentlemen, let's have a warm round of applause for our very own Dr. Gerald Corey.

GERALD COREY I want to begin by thanking those who got me here because I’ll tell you about a year ago when I got the invitation, I was checking my e-mail and it said, we’re inviting you to be a keynote speaker, I almost fell off my chair. I did! And I said, what keynote? So, I considered a distinct honor and a real privilege to be able to be here as a keynoter. And my hope is that my message can reach many people. And I also want to start by acknowledging someone, a very important person who is up here in spirit with me and that's Marianne Schneider Corey. My best friend. My best colleague and my best wife for 46 years. The only wife I've had. So, I'm just going to ask her to come up here, so you can see what she looks like.

GERALD COREY One thing I would like to do today is talk about the theme of how the counselor as a person in a profession are so tied up that you can't separate the two, that who you are as persons intermittently affects how we work as professionals. And our professional life no matter what it is whether a counselors, counselor educators, whatever setting we work in, I think what's critical is that professional life impacts our personal life. I just don't know how to separate the two. And what I would like to do in the next… Alright, stop biting me. In the next in the time I have until 10:30 is talk about maybe ten different themes about the intersection between the counselor as person and professional. One of the first areas that I want to address briefly is the counselor as person and profession and the importance of the personhood of the counselor. It seems so simple and yet you know I don't think it's given nearly enough attention in the literature and in our teaching. Maybe it's becoming more so, but I think there is a lot more attention given to knowledge and skills and content and trends and all that's important. But I think if we forget the importance of the personhood of the counselor we’re forgetting the most important thing. And there is some abundant research that supports the idea that the counselor as person is one of the most critical, not the most, but one of the most critical variables in therapy outcomes. So, I ask you for a moment, I wanted to talk about some personal characteristics of what makes for a effective counselor. And may be you can just ask yourself for a moment what characteristic do I have that I most value, that I think is my greatest asset as a counselor or a helper or a social worker or an agent? And may be just think what is that one trait, they’re probably a number of them and they intersect. But you might think about that and I'll list just a few. One is for me is having curiosity, a real sense of interest in the client. So a curious spirit another having some interpersonal skills. You know you would think the counselors are interpersonally skilled and yet I worry sometimes that we have technicians, the unskilled helper. Gerry Egan wrote a book called the Skilled Helper and sometimes I think we have counselors who are unskilled as a person. Another is that they really care, not that they just intellectually care, but they’re really compassionate individuals that they involve themselves in the lives of others. Another, and I think this is very important that they show respect, genuine respect for people who are different from them and who differ in many significant ways perhaps. Another is that they have courage and they’re willing to take risks that they don't worry if they make a mistake, that they don't think that, you know, mistake is failure. They can at least think, okay, so I made a mistake, how can I retrieve from that, recoil from that. I've got all these microphones here, so one of it will work. Another one is, I think they have a healthy sense of self-pride. Now in… they have a German expression that Marianne often says and it's called Eigenlob Stinkt, and what that means is self-love stinks or self-praise. And yet, you know, I think, it is important to have a healthy sense of self-pride that's a characteristic (inaudible ) with an effective counselor. Another one is that we have social interest going beyond self. And Adler talked about that and that to me is a very, very vital component of a good counselor. Another one that I… I'm just rattling these off thinking, you know, what ones would you want to reflect on more and how might you want to develop some of these for yourself? One of them is avoiding perfectionism. That's a biggie, I think. Sometimes people say Gerry how do you manage to write and do the things you do? Because I think I am no longer worried about perfectionism. I realized that we have editors and then we have second tries. So, I think if we get too hung up on being perfect, the perfect counselor making the perfect intervention, we're not going to do anything. So, I would hope we could free ourselves up. There is a book that was written and I don't know who wrote it, may be Dreikurs and is called The Courage to be Imperfect. The idea that, you know, if we make mistake it’s not fatal. Another is a sense of humor. I don't see enough of that in books and counselor training. I don't see enough written about the ability to laugh at ourselves, never, never, never at a client in a demeaning sort of a way. But I think it’s great when the rapport eventually builds and the clients can, you know, and counselor can laugh together, that I think is healthy. Another one is personal presence. That to me, I think is really critical and that we can show up. And I want to talk more about that later when I talk about self-care. Another is the ability to make maybe significant connection with our clients. Really connection, I don’t mean just intellectual connection, but somehow where there is a meeting, an (inaudible ). Erving Polster one of the men I most admire and his wife, late wife Miriam Polster, they’re Gestalt therapists who really I think did the most of modernized Gestalt therapy. Erving Polster is a great example of a person who is really present. When he sits with a client and does an interview or a counseling session with the audience this large, he is right there with that person. He is not thinking what is going to say and that he’s fully in contact. So, I think the ability to make significant connection is critically important. And in addition to that the ability to disconnect. I think that’s critical, because if we stay connected and the client leaves the office, then I think we’re gonna to be ineffective of we take all of our clients home psychologically with us, because then we’re gonna wear ourselves out. So I asked you to just the kind think for a moment, what characteristics do you want to work on? I don’t think we have to be perfect human beings. I think our clients will give us a lot of room for making a lot of mistakes and a lot of latitude. Another area that I’d like to talk a bit about is the counselor as… By the way there are so many books written on the subject of becoming an effective counselor. One I see Sam Gladding in the second row, he wrote a great book called Becoming a Counselor: The light, the Bright, and the Serious and is published by ACA and second edition too. And the other colleague of mine, Jeffery Kottler writes about four books a year. He wrote a book called On Being a Therapist. And there are many books I think on the subject of becoming and being a therapist. So, we have lot of resources. I want to say something secondary. I want to get into as the counselor, as a ethical person and talk a bit about ethics. You know I don’t see how we can separate ethics from our being and our own personal philosophy and value system. I think ethics to me is how we live our lives and that’s reflected in how we treat our clients. And I have some notes just I want to be sure to cover some key points. But the speaker yesterday talked about complex problems and complicated problems. And I think ethics presents a lot of complex problems and there are no simple answers, there’re very many ethical issues that are posed to us. So, what I strive to teach my students when I teach an ethics course as I do every year at California State University of Fullerton is I try to get them to think outside of the box in a way and not so much in legalist terms and not so much in terms of thinking about, will I get sued in risk management perspective. But a lot more in terms of, how can I do the best for the largest number of clients that I’m going to see? And you know ACA’s 2005 code that Barber Hurley(ph) is sitting next to Sam Gladding in the second row too. She and others had a lot to do with revising the 2005 ACA code. And they did a tremendous job I think in really revamping the code. And one piece of the code is aspirational ethics as opposed to mandatory ethics. And what I try to do with my students is to get them to think not so much about what you need to do minimally to avoid getting into trouble, but what do you need to do to reach your client in the most significant profound way. So, one thing comes to my mind is, by the way I am so impressed with so many of you who are students. Marianne is too, we talked about this last night, we said we are just so impressed with all the students we meet and I never get tired of having students come up to Marianne and me; “Oh, will you take a picture with us.” And sometimes you’re so timid and you’re …you’re so apologetic and (inaudible ) and I love it, this is the only time of the year I can ever get famous. All the rest of the time people are trying to get rid off me. So, I’m just so impressed and so is Marianne with the spirit that so many of you as graduate students have. And it really, I think makes this both so hopeful about the future of counseling. And I’m just delighted to see how many students show up at the conferences. We’ve asked, how many of you are students? And 90% of the hands went up. I can see out there. How many are students? Turn around and look at that. Oh, my gosh! Look at that, fantastic! There are a few non-students, that’s good, that’s good. So I’m going to be talking a lot to students in the rest of time I have to. You know, what role does… do ethics codes play in your being an ethical counselor? I want to address that a bit. I think you ought to know the code, not by memory surely, but at least you ought to have it and if you have any ethical struggle you ought to at least know what did the code say, that would be I think important. But you know, I think, ethics is not a simple matter of taking the code book out, I think ethics is much deeper that the codes give us a blueprint, a general framework, but it certainly doesn’t answer or address the complexity of the problem that we meet. And I mentioned just a moment ago about aspirational ethics. I want to give just one example of it. I may give others, but… Many of you are students, might like to get personal counseling and yet you can’t afford it, and I think this is an area where season counselors could and probably should give at least part of their work to students on a much, much reduced basis or even pro bono. We’re asked in our ACA code to give something for those who couldn’t afford it , but need our services. And I think that’s a different way of thinking about ethics than, well what happens if I touch a client? What happens if I see a client on the street that I know? See, I think, I know, I’m not at all a fan of rule-based ethics, but much a more a fan of reflective ethics and ethics that are part of our basic personality structure. The thing I try to get my students to think about too is the ability to deal with grayness, gray, ambiguity in ethics. So many times, the first day my students say, well what will I need to do to not get into trouble or while I’m talking this class is I want to be sure that you know I don’t get in trouble with the licensing board or with the ethics committee. And I think that’s not a way to think, otherwise we’re gonna be practicing scared. And I don’t think that’s a particularly healthy way. One more comment about ethics and becoming an ethical person is I think it’s a developmental perspective, no matter how long we’re in this business. I think, we can always think how could I meet new ethical challenges in a new way and look at it from a fresh light? So, maybe it gives us an opportunity to look at some of our ethical dilemmas, in another way as we season. So, I don’t think it’s a question that we’ve got all wrapped up once we get our masters or doctorate. Moving branching off from ethical person, I’d like to talk about ethics briefly from a multicultural perspective. And what that might imply in terms of you and me as a practitioner. Recently, we went to the McCallum Theatre in Palm Springs and Bill Cosby was there. And he drank four bottles of water in his two hours of presentation of having the group laugh and what not. So, I’ll try to limit myself to one. I’m functioning on empty. Usually, I have a modest breakfast, two eggs, baken, bagels, cereal, fruit, orange juice, coffee, I’m kind of forgetting, but that’s a modest breakfast. This morning I didn’t have time, so I just had cereal and fruit and coffee and orange juice, half a banana and some cereal granola, but that was a very modest. But dinner I stock up on. And I’ve got a… Marianne is a fantastic cook and people look at me and say; “Gerry, how can you stay like you’re with that kind of meals? Do you eat that way every night?” And I say; “Well, if I can.” In fact, we went on a cruise once and I’m looking here and I can see Bob Wubbolding right in the front row. And Bob and Sandy, Marianne and me, we went on this cruise to Alaska over the Caribbean. And Bob started writing everything I ate down. He did! And then when he wasn’t with me he would say; “Gerry what did you have for snack? How many yogurts did you have? What else did you have?” And he kept this list very dutifully and at the end of it he sent me an e-mail with this whole list of all the things I had. And then co-presented on the topic and Bob started off by saying; “Put an overhead projector here.” And he said; ”This is a colleague of mine that ate all of this in one week.” And I think there are about 20 eggs, 48 strips of bacon. And he said; “Guess who he is?” Okay, that’s a digression. And I shouldn’t digress, but I’ll come back to it. As long as I’m on that digression, I’m proud to say that my father-in-law, Heinrich Schneider, rest his soul. He was a great man. He bought me a weeding outfit, when we got married in Germany, the Cathedral of Worms, 46 years ago. And I looked at the thing and I said; “That’s great, but can I wear it to teaching, to go to school.” And I made some points with him. He was very impressed that I wouldn’t just wear a suit once and then discard it. And I still have it. And when one of our daughters got married, I said; “You know I love… I don’t wanna wear a damn tuxedo and pay $40 or whatever it cost.” I said; “Why can’t I wear my wedding suit.” And I got in it and I fit in perfectly you know. So, she said; “Well, you can wear it to the rehearsal dinner. But Brian really wants you to wear a tuxedo.” So I wore the damn tuxedo and looked like a penguin. But, you know, you wanna get (inaudible ). I want to say a few things about an extension of the counselors and ethical person from a diversity perspective. The ACA codes 2005 have a new, it’s built in, every section has something to do with multiculturalism and diversity. So when you talk about diagnosis, there are something in there about how this fits from a multicultural perspective, which I think is very good. And I think what I want to say about this. I’m thinking of, how we bring our personal baggage or cultural baggage frequently into our interactions. There is a very wonderful podcast that Dr. Courtland Lee made recently and it’s on multiculturalism and diversity. And I listen to three times in my car going in and he talks about cultural baggage that we all bring into our work. And our job as counselors, he says, and I think that’s very important part of ethics, that we become a layer of our biases and prejudices and our stereotypes and our own cultural encapsulation. Awareness is so critical, because that’s the beginning of change. So I think that’s the key piece for me. Another is, Paul Peterson would say, and he has done a lot for multicultural movement. He wrote a book for ACA called Handbook of Multicultural Counseling. Paul would always say and still says in his workshops “Counseling, a diversity can be your friend. It doesn’t have to be your enemy and so welcome diversity and work with how it plays out in your interchange.” And I think all exchanges are multicultural in many respect. So, I think it’s important to kind of pay attention to our client to find out what aspect we should focus on, you know, rather than going into the session and saying; “Ah, I noticed you’re different from me in this respect.” Why not allow the differences to emerge and encourage the client to talk about what it’s like to be in this encounter? And then if the client says something like; “Well. I wonder if you’re gonna understand me?” And say; “Well help me out how might I have difficulty.” Well, I’m man and you’re woman and I wonder if we’re gonna be able to bridge that gap or there is age difference or there is cultural difference. You know, I used to worry when Mariana and I were asked to go to another country like Ireland. We went there five times already and we loved it. But I was a little worried, because Mariana is German and I’m… Can I still be heard if I sit this far back? I can, okay. Mariana is German and I’m Italian. And, you know, I kind of wondered, how’s that gonna mix with Irish? And you know, after I stopped worrying so much about would we head it off, I found if we were ourselves, we did get along just quite well in many regards. I think, our culturally different clients are gonna expect this to know everything about them. They are not. And I think they’re very tolerant in us even making cultural (inaudible ). If we have a good heart and a good spirit and we really are invested in not imposing our view of the world on them, I think that’s the critical piece. So often sometimes I think, we all, I know I do, sometimes I think, if the whole world will think the way I do it will be a hell of a lot better place, God help us. But sometimes I think, you know, I try to control universe and I’m not very good at it. But I think in some ways, we might think, may be we have the answer for our clients. And I think that’s unfortunate, because I don’t think our job is to give our clients answers, but to help our clients find their own answers within the framework of their culture. I think that’s critical. Oh, there is a shelf here that I didn’t see! I don’t have to put everything up here. You know, another piece before I leave the multicultural aspects of you being an effective counselor is our willingness to change our role as a counselor. I think a lot of times we’re trained in counselor programs to work with the individual, okay, in an individual setting, one-on-one and I hate to say this, but I think this model might be a little archaic. And I think there might be other models that are more effective and maybe that we ought to be thinking about, how can I take counseling out of the office and into a border context? Particularly, how can I take counseling out of the one-on-one office and go into the community with it? And I think that demands a different role for a counselor. For example, I think counselors are called upon to be applicants at times and to be change agents and to help clients that don’t have a voice to find a voice. The speaker yesterday talked about speak out. I think that was one of our six points. And I think a lot of clients sometimes and lot of us whom we start are afraid to use our voices. And so maybe a counselors job, particularly when we work with a diversity perspective is to help our clients find the voice that’s within and have the courage to be able to speak and say what they think. And a lot of people aren't used to that I think. You know, one more think that occurs to me that I’ve here is cultural sensitivity is not limited to any one group. I think, every person in this audience including all of us, I think have a mandate to become culturally competent and culturally effective. And I don’t think it is a finished product. I think, it’s an ongoing life long kind of endeavor. And I think, sometimes we get way to hung up on our differences and forgetting that we swim in the same tide. Existentially, we all worry about some of the same universal issues about finding meaning in life, the fact that we’re gonna die eventually, how we deal with freedom and responsibility and the anxiety that brings. And Dr. Clemmont Vontress got an award and he’s gonna become a fellow and Dr. Lindy, your president acknowledged Dr. Vontress in terms of the contribution he made in her life as a mentor. And by the way, I very much liked to your article where you said; “You hope everybody in the profession finds one person to mentor.” And I think that was a great line in terms of you carrying forward whatever you’ve gotten from somebody else and giving it to others, giving others hope, giving others inspiration, giving other a sense that they can do it, particularly when they doubt that they can do anything. So, I think we’re all called in one way or another to be mentors, and we’re all mentees in some ways. I get a great deal from students. I really mean that. The best reviewers that we have in our books are students reviewers. And some of the best colleagues that I have are former students and some of them are right here in the audience, having doctorates, and writing and doing all sorts of things. But Dr. Vontress makes one very important point that I hope we remember, maybe we ought to focus more on our commonalities rather than our differences. And I’m thinking of a homily I heard in Palm Springs while back from, an Irish priest who is very radical and he really thinks outside the box. And he was criticizing the traditional church for the role of women have in the church or don’t have. And he was criticizing so many things that needed criticism. And he made a line and he said; “You know, we need unity through diversity.” And I like that line, Unity through Diversity and Unity and Diversity, that we don’t wanna all look alike, sound alike and… woo… alright. One more point before I move to another topic of boundaries is, I’d like to suggest that maybe the client might be a… our client… The community might be our client, that may be I mentioned taking counseling outside of the office. There is some good books on this. One is Mark Homan’s book, it’s called Promoting Community Change (inaudible ). And Mark Homan is a social worker and he talks about how you can work with groups within the community to empower them to bring about change, rather than just doing delivering services. So, Mark is saying our job as change agents should be to help people become self-sufficient. And I like that idea, that notion. I certainly wasn’t trained in it. I had never had much it all in that. And I think rather than just making a difference in the life of an individual maybe what can we do to touch community. Because so many people I think won’t come to an individual counselor’s office for a number of reasons, they’re intimated, they don’t believe in it. But maybe it’s our job to go outside and reach them where they are, by going where they’re living, maybe in churches or whatever happens to be, live with them and do our work out there. I’m gonna shift topics now. This is a very important piece. As far as I’m concerned it’s on managing personal boundaries and professional boundaries. It’s still part of becoming an ethical counselor. By the way, I was talking to somebody about this particular topic, about becoming an ethical counselor and she said; “Why do you say becoming an ethical counselor?” Hmm… You might think for a moment How would you answer that? Just think while I drink. You might think How would you answer that for you? What would you most want to say when you think about yourself as an ethical counselor? Would you wanna, want to say, I’ve arrived or I’m becoming. And how would you know you’re on the road? And she said; “Tell me why do say becoming a counselor and not being an ethical counselor?” And I said; “Because I think it’s an ongoing journey.” I don’t think it’s something we can all ever say; “Eureka, I’m there, I found it, I’m now the ethical person.” I think we always have new and subtle challenges. One of those difficult areas I think that I want to address is managing boundaries and professional… personally and professionally. I want to say that you know if we have good personal boundaries or good boundaries in our personal life, that we’re probably much better able to have good professional boundaries in our work setting. On the other hand, I think if somehow we don’t know how to say no, or in our personal lives our boundaries are non-existed, or people invade our space that we’re not gonna be very effective in setting boundaries for clients or those we work with. So that might be something think to think about. What kind of boundaries do I want? I worry sometimes that… sometimes counselors get too hung up on rigid boundaries, that they have so many rules that I’ve to be certain way. You know for me, one trait of an effective helper is that the counselor is genuine. Carl Rogers talked about this genuineness. In other words it’s you are who you are that you don’t put on airs and pretenses. And I think the person you are and the professional you are should be pretty much alike. And if you’re different when you’re in your professional role, then you are as a human being in your outside life I worry and I wonder and I say, why is there that lack of congruence. Now, certainly if you are a professional, who have a role, okay. But I think we should be ourselves no matter what. And I think that can be translated into maintaining good boundaries too. I don’t think you know boundaries have to be so tight that we don’t have room to negotiate. Fortunately, there has been a shift I think, a shift in bound… thinking about boundaries. Years ago, there used to be a lot of what I called dual relationship phobia where people are so hung up in the old codes of ethics in many organizations said; “Avoid dual relationships, because thereby they’re very nature unethical.” And I’ve a colleague in the audience, Barbara Herlihy from University of New Orleans. And she and I wrote a book with ACA few years back and now it’s in its third edition, it’s called Boundary Issues in Counseling. And we had 20 contributors, write different perspectives on boundaries. And I think why we wrote that book is that we were maybe tried of hearing so many, this is unethical, this is unethical, and we wanted to get people to kind of think, how could we be more creative and flexible in thinking about boundaries. There has been shift. People don’t talk about dual relationships now. Now it’s more multiple relationships. But that’s is not just a simple thing of two relationships, it maybe three or four ways that are roles overlapped. And also ACA came out with a new term, it’s called Nonprofessional Relationships. And I think part of our work… Damn burn it. This think bites. Part of work I think is to appreciate that all nonprofessional relationships shouldn’t have to avoided. Like, you know, some of you are counselor educators, there’re students over here, there is a social hour. What’s wrong with having a social hour with your students? You know, what if only your client says; “You meant a lot to me and I’m getting married and I want you to know that your counseling with me helped me finally make the step, and it really mean a lot to me if you came to my wedding?” Now, some people say; “Oh my gosh, I can’t do that. That would be crossing a boundary.” And I think, you know, sometimes we may need to kind of think maybe that boundary needs to be crossed. There are two other examples that come to mind, one is gift-giving and bordering. And I’ll just very briefly mention as examples of boundaries. What if a client were to say something like; “You know, this is the end of our session and I’ve a gift, and I want to give you this as a symbol of our work together and what you’ve meant me and what our relationship is meant? Now, I ask my students would you take the gift? And then we role play it. I love role playing with my students and they don’t wanna role play with me. I don’t know why, but I’ll say; “I’ll be the client, you be the counselor.” So I’ll say something like this. I’ll say; “You know, Jamie I really like to tell you how much you meant to me as my therapist and I have a gift for you.” And Jamie would say; “Oh!”. And then I would say; “You know, I have this Rolex watch and I want you to have this.” And Jaime would say; “Thanks.” He probably go… You know you laugh, but Mariana and I were picked up a speaker… we were in a country, I won’t mention the name of the country and I admired his watch and I said; “What is that?” And he said; “A Rolex watch” I said; “Oh!” I said; “Well I’m hear I might get something, but not that fancy.” And he said; “Oh!” I said; “Where did you get it?” He said; “A client gave it to me.” So, now that’s a Rolex watch. By the way, there is a great book that I want you to pick up, one of your former keynoters wrote it and he is a wonderful writer, Irv Yalim. Yalim, it’s called Lying on the Couch, Lying on the Couch. And it’s a novel. I don’t read many novels, but I did read this one. And I assigned it to my ethics class. And my students love it, because they say (inaudible ) gets them to think about boundaries and gets them to think, because Yalim in here writes about how do deal with sexual attractions, how to deal with gift giving, how to deal with issues of going in the business with the client, roles. I think a book like that could really get you to thinking. And my students say; “My gosh, I thought I’d never have any problem with this, it was cut and dried and I read that! And boy that really got me thinking! So, gift-giving, you know, now the ACA code says that sometimes gifts may be appropriate if you think about the context, the culture of the client. If you think about the timing, the motivation of the client. For giving it, the motivation of the counselor for accepting it or rejecting it. Isn’t that much more healthy rather than saying; “Thou shall never accept a gift.” I don’t mean to say anything wrong with a counselor giving a small gift to a client. May be it could be something we make, it could be, I’m not saying you have to. Another one is bordering. I talked to some people yesterday, the book signing and they work in a rule setting and I said; “I bet you have some interesting ethical issues there?” And he said; “Yeah, we walk into the grocery store, we see our client. We go to the gym, our client was there. I go to church and the client is there.” So I said; “Well what you do? Do you stop going to church, stop going to the gym, stop going to the bank, stop going to the grocery store?” Mariana used to practice in a small town where we live. It’s mountain community in Southern California, and all your client you would see so, what could she do? She’d go to the grocery store and they’d say; “Hey Mariana, my husband and I had a hell of fight last night.” And then she had to kind of train them and say; “Well, maybe it’s best we not talk about that when we’re standing in line checking out.” But now what you do to meet a client on the street? You go on the other side of the street and pretend you don’t know him? So all that’s part of managing boundaries I think. One of the think I want to say about boundaries before I leave and go to another topic is the concept of the slippery slope. I think it’s Gabbert and somebody else that developed this idea. The whole notion of, if you did start anything no matter how mild it is, even a handshake with a client, eventually it could lead up to some kind of erotic thing or… So best never cross any boundary, because if you do, you’re gonna go downhill and downhill and downhill and it will be terrible. I think that’s slippery slope phenomenon is utter nonsense. There may be some grain of truth in it, but I think if we try too hard to keep boundaries so rigid, then we’re not gonna make contact. And I mentioned earlier that contact is so vitally important and presence with our clients. But I think it’s critical and I don’t know that any code can mandate this is that we never ever misuse our power, that we never exploit our client, that we never harm our client, that our personal needs don’t get in the way of the client’s needs. That’s what’s crucial to me, not, you know, if we avoid every kind of multiple relationship. There is a good book by Ofer Zur. And it’s called Boundary Issues in Counseling. Multiple, no that’s our book, Barbara Herlihy’s and mine.

GERALD COREY I didn’t want plug our book! If you only gotto read one book. My colleague Ofer Zur, it’s with a APA Press and it’s called Boundaries in Psychotherapy, Boundaries in Psychotherapy by APA Press. And he offers a course in ethics online. I really like the work of Ofer Zur does. By the way, I’ll give you a quick, quick story that he mentioned in one of his talks. He was saying how he had an adolescent client. And he couldn’t reach the client, no matter what he did, he just couldn’t reach the client. He'd come in each week and the client wouldn’t be talking. The client would just sit there and look at him and stare. And so, Zur would say, do his best and he would outstare him and finally, Zur said, found out that he liked to play basketball. And then he said; “How instead of coming into this office would you like… we could meet in the court and we could play some basketball?” And they did. And Zur outshined his adolescent. And he said after that they had great rapport, they started talking, they started working and great things happened. Now, why I like Zur so much is I think he’s really thinking kind of outside of the box, but he’s very concerned about ethics. But he is saying, it’s always contextual and we all rather than universalizing, thou shall not, maybe we need to think with each encounter how boundaries will be different at different stages in our counseling. I’m thinking of one of my favorite movies with my one of my very favorite actors, Robin Williams. I like him. Why I like him so much? He’s so crazy. And I like him particularly when they tried to do an interview with him and he was allover everywhere. He’s taking his coat off and putting it over Diane Sawyer’s face. I just liked the way he’s kind of crazy. I don’t like people that are too stiff, you know, like a little bit of looseness. And he did a great film called Good Will Hunting. And I used to show that on my ethics class, the first day snippets of it. And then I'd say to the students; “Now, what do you think? He took Will out to the park and had his session there. You see any problem there?” And then, the therapist was disclosing about his wife and his issues and all of that; "What do you think about that from an ethical perspective?" So that… that film could be very powerful I think in terms of getting students to think about ethics and boundary crossings and things of that nature. Another piece, and I wanna you watch so I've enough time to get to the second half, about values. I want to say something about values in counseling and how that's extension of our ethics too. You know, I think, our values or something we carry in to our work with our clients. And I don't know how it's possible or if it's possible or if it's even desirable, that we try to leave our values outside the door. I think, it's important that we will become of aware of our values, so that we can see how they might be playing out in our encounters with our clients. And I think, it's… I hope you hear this, it's never appropriate to impose our value stance on our clients, but we might expose it, we might share our values, and we might say, I want to you know where I'm out with this, because I want you to not be unduly influenced by what I'm thinking on this subject. But I think this is an area where may be a lot of us struggle, particularly when we have difference of opinion or different view from our client. And my students struggle with this, because sometimes students say, well what I do if I have a client that has a radically different view on life and different set of values? What if I don't agree with my clients value? And I also want to say, it's not your job to agree or disagree. It's not about you, it's about your client. And I don't think it's our job to tell our clients how to live, but challenge our clients to figure out how they want to live. And I'm thinking a reality therapy now. And Bob Wubbolding here right in the front like he has a nice model of WDEP, what are your wants, what are you doing and evaluation to help the client evaluate what he is doing or she is doing, are you getting what you want? And then once the client says; "I'm not so sure the way I'm living, this is the way I want to continue living.” Then you can build the plan of action to change it. But I think my students sometimes fortunately, lately, they haven't been this way, but I've encountered some and I hear stories from counselor educators in other parts where they say sometimes we get rather rigid students, they think they have missionary zeal and that if a client thinks differently about something like a divorce or something differently about religion that they can work with them. And I would wanna say, I hope you almost never have to refer a client because of a value difference. I think we should be able to suspend and bracket our values so that, why do I have to agree or disagree. I don't think that's the key. I think the important part is it's somehow, you know, I don't take my value frame, put it on yours and say, now I can work with you, because you think as I think. There is a very good article that Mary Herman and Barbara Herlihy wrote about the Bruff case. And it's about, I don't know three or four years ago in the journal of counseling and development, counseling and development and it's on the Bruff case. And it's basically about a counselor who refused to counsel a lesbian couple, because she felt it violated her moral stance. And then she wanted to sue the counseling agent… agency, because they wanted to let her go, because of her belief system discriminating and they said you can't discriminate, because it's against ACA codes and she said, I should have a right to refuse treatment to any client I want. Now, that was a classic case and it's a classic article. Just not too long ago, I found out there is another case brewing of a graduate student who was dismissed from a counselor ed program, because she said, I can't work with gay people, I can't work with people who are having extramarital affairs, I can't work with a person who wants an un… who has an unwanted pregnancy, who is may be thinking of abortion, I can't work with end of life decisions, if they're even flirting with the idea of rational suicide. Who could she work with? You know, really! So, I think, that's a very crucial piece that maybe we need to get on our own therapy to kind of think about, why I sometimes have a need to convert by clients to think as I think? So, the bottom line there is I don't think we should ever have to refer a client, because of a value difference certainly for not competent to work, and then I think referrals and order. You know, I think, to quickly here how we refer is important? How we refer? I never wanna make it sound like I'm referring you, because it's your problem. I want to say something about the difficulty I might be having to be the best therapist for you possible. And maybe there is somebody else that can work more effectively with you than I could. One other piece, very important piece, I gave a whole keynote on this topic. I think, one I'm remembering at the Alabama Counseling Association a few years back, it was an hour-and-a-half talk, just on the role of spiritual and religious values in counseling. We have an organization here, a cervix, The Association for Spiritual and Religious Values in Counseling. And I think there is a place in counseling for discussion, conversation around religious and spiritual values. Having said that, I'm gonna say little more about that, but I worry sometimes, because I think there maybe some people who are so inclined to wanna bring in a particular religious point of view when maybe it's not what the client wants or needs. So, what I think I’d wanna say in the interest of time is, I think what’s crucial is that we are willing to assess for a client’s background in the area. What gave your life a meaning? What gives your life meaning? Can you tell me anything about your spiritual journey that might be helpful for me in working with you? And what if a person says, when we were in Ireland, I mentioned that, we had a lot of people that were very, very angry at the church, they really were, including priest and nuns, because we did five-day group counseling training workshops. And that became a big part of our work at times. They had a need to kind of talk about, the pain that they were still carrying over some of the people within the church. That wasn’t the whole of it, but… So, I think, if I had a client like that I’d certainly wanna make room for the client to be able to talk about his/her pain and anger and guilt, because that would be an important part of the agenda. Some clients, if we don't talk about certain religious believes, we might not be doing good work, because they might be saying, you know, for me, a central part of my life happens to be religion or certain set of core spiritual values. And if we can't talk about that, I don't know how I can really work. So, I think it's important that we be open to discussing this arena, if it's important for the client, but last point on that I think it's so important that we monitor ourselves so that we don't bring our own agenda, spiritual or otherwise into our work. I’m gonna go a little bit faster, in terms of… because I wanna get through the in the next 22 minutes I have. I want to shift gear somewhat, because I think all of us, have trouble at times with stress and with managing stress and distress. And that's a very important part I think of the counselor as person and professional. And main thing I wanna ask, I like what the speaker did yesterday and I probably won’t do it, because if I did it I wouldn't get you back, but I'd like you to ask yourself she had us pair up with somebody and for 30 seconds talk, I can't see how could you answer this in 30 seconds, but at least you can reflect. You might say, what causes stress in my professional life? And what causes stress in my personal life? I think that's an important one. And then maybe you might reflect for a moment of how do you deal with stress? Are you pretty good at it or not? Does it control you or do you control it? Donald Meichenbaum, the cognitive behavior therapist who has done a lot of good stuff. Don Meichenbaum says; "Stress like beauty is in the eye of the beholder." And so what might cause me stress might be relaxing for you and so I think we really need to kind of look at what are the sources of stress and how can I better identify them and manage them. I think it's unrealistic to think will I ever get rid of stress, it's there. And I think so many of you are really struggling in your workplace. I know my daughter, Cindy who is (inaudible ) in Multicultural Community Counseling, and she is teaching in a university in a very special program, it’s called Community-Based Counseling. It's a nontraditional program. Her passion is multicultural counseling. She got it from her mother and she got it from very close friends too. And she really wants to change the world by helping people to become more open and more accepting. And she does that in her work. And I forgot why I was gonna bring that in. Ah, I know now! It just came back to me. She said or says something about the stress she feels at her work, because she wonder as if she is gonna have job. They want from seven full-time faculty to three. Then she was told, we don't know if you gonna have program even that we might wipe off the whole program that’s been going for years and years and years. And the students were uproar, because they go out in the community and start serving the community. So, the anxiety and the stress that so many people feel in their jobs and so many of you feel. So, what I think really helps is if you can find a support system and get somebody to listen and may be figure out how can we prevent stress from getting the best of us. You know, sometimes people say to me, “Jerry you don't have any stress, you just give everybody stress in your life.” And I think there is some truth to that. I tend to be a little bit stressful. I don't know why. And you know, I think even traveling is stressful. Just think what it took to get here? How many times do you get to a place and then your bags don't show up? I was gonna do a workshop in Canada and I was gonna be the keynote speaker, I get there, I go up to the line and all the bags come out, guess what, my two bags weren't there. And then I had to live with no bags for two days. And so I'm walking around and borrowed sweatshirts and all of that. So that’s highly stressful. In fact the most stressful part of going to a conference is getting there, and then… So, I think we need to kind of figure out how can I create a life where stress won’t chew me up and I'll learn how to manage it eventually. I'd like to suggest that maybe this doesn't cause much money. Maybe we could buy some tapes or a read book. I've got a couple in mind, Jon Kabat-Zinn, Jon Kabat-Zinn wrote two good books, one is called Full Catastrophe Living and the other is called Wherever You Go There You Are: Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life. And Jon Kabat-Zinn developed the whole stress management program for people who suffered heart attacks, and they needed to change their whole style of life, so they wouldn't have another massive heart attack that would kill them. And maybe we need to kind of pay attention to how stress is affecting us personally, so we don’t get to the point where we are burned out. Because eventually, if we get burned out we’re gonna get impaired. And that to me is a major ethical issue. When we’re no longer and how can we be present for our clients if our well was dry? How can we be effective in our work if personally we're drained? If personally we look at a client and say; ”Oh God, when will this hour be over?” ”Oh thank God it’s Friday and it’s only Sunday!” You know, there is a very good book that a colleague wrote and it’s called Empathy fatigue, Empathy Fatigue. And the author is Mark Stebnicki. And Mark Stebnicki talks about the price we pay as healers for listening to other peoples’ problem saturated stories. That it’s not possible to really listen to people, take them in and be there and not be personally affected. And Mark talks about the cost in terms of our personal lives, if somehow we don’t know how to manage that and disengage and move away from, you know, when the client leaves we leave. There is another very good book. I wanna move to my almost last topic on taking care of yourself, the importance of self-care. John Norcross and Jim Guy wrote a book, Guilford Press and it’s called Leaving It At The Office, Leaving It At The Office, self-care for psychotherapist. Great book! And he give us all day workshops at conferences like this on for mental health professionals about how to keep yourself alive personally and professionally. You know, Marianne and I have given talks on this topic. And what we say is you can’t afford not to take care of yourself, because eventually it will bite us if we don’t. Eventually, it will catch up to us. And I think it’s important maybe say that it’s ethical mandate that we take care of yourselves. I like what the speaker said, Patti Digh yesterday about love yourself or love more, that was another, one of our message. I liked her comment about, “put your mask on first.” You know, I have note here that says, “put yourself on the front burner.” I wonder how many of you all, it sounds like I come from Mississippi, how you all… I wonder how many of you all put yourself on the back burner, and say, I don’t have time for myself. I have too many other people to attend to. My family comes first. And I’m not saying to be selfish in the sense of saying you fend for yourself and I’m gonna do my own thing, not all. But I think if we don’t take exquisite care of ourselves then we’re not gonna be worth much for others. And eventually, in fact, somebody told me this yesterday. If I give out of emptiness, pretty soon I’m gonna start resenting the people I’m giving to. So I do hope, I really do hope that each of us, each of you in this audience can kind of think, how can I put myself in my schedule book? How can I begin to do more of what I want to do, to keep myself alive and vital? Like I wonder how many of you do some of the things you say you really love doing? May be it’s going fishing, may be it’s watching a sunset, may be watching a sunrise, may be it’s playing with your grandkids. That’s a new hobby for me. I have three grandchildren. Marianne and I thought we’d never have them. And they gift us with grandchildren we’re old folk. You know, so, I think, we need to kind of think, you know, maybe playing with grandchildren is a vitalizing source. But I think we need to do something for ourselves to energize our batteries or otherwise I think pretty soon our personal… professional life will really show up. You know, one trait that I think I do have, I’m not very patient. Patience is not one of my virtues and I don’t have too many virtues. But stamina, I have and I like to accomplish things and produce and, you know, keep active. But I think that, you know, there is a price to pay for that too. And I think we had balance in our lives, whatever that may take. Somebody asked Albert Ellis once; “What do you do for vacation?” And he said; “Hell, I never take a vacation.” And somebody said; “Well don’t you ever go anywhere?” And he said; “No.” And then, he said… he said; “I wouldn’t even go to the Taj Mahal, unless they wanted me to do a workshop there.” So, you know, he said who is anybody to tell me of what I should do. So you might stop and think what is balance mean to you? I wrote a book, a new one for ACA and it’s an extension of this talk and it’s called Creating Your Professional Path: Lessons from My Journey. And after I accepted this keynote I thought, this is the book I’ve been wanted to write for at least five years so I finally wrote it. And Marianne and I went on many trails and every single day we would talk and talk and talk about the chapter I’d be working on. Marianne said; “Oh God I hope you finish this book soon. I’m getting so tired of talking about this subject. Can’t you talk about anything else except this damn book.” Finally, it isn’t boring. But, there is a whole chapter there on self-care and a whole chapter on how to be a writer. And I think that it’s important to think what balance means. I had 18 students write a piece about their journey. There is a person named Mark Rizer, who is in a doctoral program just finishing. And he wrote a piece about balancing work and academia, and how he combines astronomy with counselor education. And he says, he really needs both of those. So, each of us I think needs to find our own formula to balance our lives. Few more points, and I won’t go over time. We were recently at the evolution of psychotherapy conference and I was so annoyed at some of the keynote speakers that went on a half hour over time, I said; “Damn it, I’m not gonna do that.” So I won’t. But, I think for body, mind and spirit and I think wellness. I’m going to talk a bit about wellness, includes taking care of all dimensions, not just body, not just mind, but mind, body and spirit, the integration of all of that. And, so often I hear people say, ”I don’t have time to take care of myself.” And again I said it earlier, but I wanna say it again, you can’t afford not to take time to take care of yourself. And you know one area of taking care of yourself might be to think about how I can be more present in the universe. And I want to talk now of few pathways, very briefly to living maybe a healthy lifestyle or to achieving wellness or to be moving in that direction at least. You know, a lot of us are very good about maintaining our cars and taking often to get tuned up and serviced. But we are not nerdy as good about taking care of ourselves. And so may be we can use that as a model and think, how can I begin to take at least just good care of myself as I do my car? Now, I just forget my car needs servicing and drive it and drive it and drive it and eventually Marianne will say; “You’re way overdoing you should take the car in.” But, you know, I think, that we need to kind of say, maybe I need to find ways to tune up. I don’t need a major overhaul, but I might need a tune up. And one very important concept here is mindfulness, I think. We were recently at the American Group Psychotherapy Association and right before that the Association of Specialist and Group Work and conferences in New Orleans. And in both of those conferences, they had whole presentations on mindfulness and four students were giving a presentation on how their professor is teaching them how to be more mindful in their practicum. And I think that’s great, because I think it’s a way of getting more present. And I must admit and I will confess this, I have a hell of a time in being mindful and doing one thing at a time. Usually, I am doing this one thing and I’m over here. If I’m trying to be in the here and now frequently I’m there then thinking about the future or I’m thinking about the past. And I think it’s a real challenge. I know it is for me, but for many of us to show up and be in the moment. It’s very hard, very difficult. I want to give a very brief, and I’m aware of my time and I will end on time. But, I’m thinking today is an anniversary, exactly… By the way, I meant to start with this and I forgot, but I hope she won’t mind. My mother would have been 106 years old on Friday on St. Joseph’s feast day. Her name is Josephine. And I was gonna say, and I’m gonna say it now, I’m dedicating this keynote in honor of my mother Josephine who was very patient in putting up with me, who wouldn’t let me get away with anything. She’ll say; “Oh, you’re such a past.” So, I’m dedicating this whole keynote to her. But a year ago, just a year ago almost to the minute, I was in Charlotte, about to go to give a talk to about 200 graduate students called is there life after graduate school. I was on the escalator, going up, I think, and I asked somebody, I said; “Where is room 204?” or whatever it is. And they said; “Oh, it's down there.” So in my impatience I turned around and I ran up an escalator that was going down that was a big, big mistake. Because I reached out with my left arm and fell and I felt something and it felt like somebody had taken my arm and just twisted off it with socket. And I walked in because the show had to go on. And I was thinking of ten things, like how am I going to open the talk? And one of the things, you know, what am I gonna say as the first few lines? So I walked in and said; “I just did a very stupid thing as I was coming up here I ran up an escalator and it wasn’t very smart.” Well, come to find out I dislocated my shoulder. I fractured my glenoid bone in the left arm. And I didn’t get any medical attention for about three weeks later, because after ACA I went to St. Louis to a conference there that I have participated in psycho drama, okay. So, a month later I went and got a MRI and the doctor said; “How old are you?” And I said; “72!” And he said; “72! Umm…!” He said; “Are you on steroids?” And I said; “No, I don’t even take vitamins.” And he said, because the radiologist said it’s a miracle. The person of your age didn’t tear his rotator cuff. Now that one brief mindlessness act of running up an escalator cost me and untold hours of time plus pain plus the insurance company’s money. So, and I could say a few more things if I had time about how I had been in my car a few times, because my mind hasn’t been always on things. So, I think may be we only the kind of find a way to be more mindful and be more in the moment. And that may not cost much, may be it to be as simple as doing some meditative exercises. I’m going to run out of time, so I’m just going to tell you the last two points that I was going make, may be it’s simple as not forgetting to breath. You know so many times we forget to breath. And all we need to do is may be say stop. I like the point of the keynoter of last night, yesterday morning, Patti Digh. One of her last points was slowdown, slowdown. And may be we need to just slow down and breath. I was gonna say something about personal counseling. And I think all I'll say here because I’m wrapping up is I really encourage students to think about opening themselves to personal counseling as an avenue of helping them become better counselors. Not because you have severe problems, but because I think being a client gives you a lot more respect for the difficulties of sitting in the client’s chair and helping has recognized our own issues and our own counter transference when we’re sitting with clients. So, I was going to give about a ten-minute exposition on the value of personal therapy. All I’ll say is this, if I had my way, if I were a director of a counseling program, I would wanna make sure that personal counseling was a part of that program, a vital part. And my preference would be that we had a group, group counseling and like a therapeutic group done by somebody apart from the faculty. And my last part that I never got to do today, but it’s alright, it’s that your theory of counseling. We did a whole workshop, Jamie Bludworth and I on Friday called Counseling Theory in Practice. And I think the only line I’d wanna carryout because of lack of time wrapping up is your counseling theory needs to be an expression of who you are as a person. And it, you ought to take your theory in and not get wet into it, but more that ought to be in expression of your life. I’m running out of time in the last minute, I think I’d like to say, I’m looking out and I can see more, Courtland Lee mislead me. He said; “Oh Jerry don’t worry about it, you won’t be able to see anybody. The lights are bright.” I look out, I can see people way in the back and I can even see if they are going to sleep. So, Courtland you mislead me. But I think the main thing I’d want to say enclosing is I hope that each of you listen to the universe and what message is the universe sending us. Sometimes the universe speaks a message and I don’t listen. And I think may be it’s important to listen more. And may be what we need to do is just reflect, listen, not even talk and let messages come into us and may be decide what course do I want to take and how can I begin to bring myself more fully into my work. As I’m looking out here, I’m seeing so many people and thinking what power in this room for good, what power there is collectively and individually about the circles and how that can radiate outward of how you can touch so many lives through your being and through your presence. And so may be your greatest technique by far is not the theory you hold, but the person you are and how you can be a better person, a fuller person and radiate the love you have and the gifts that you’ve been given. And maybe the best way to return is give the gift to somebody else, to use whatever gifts we have, because I think we all have unique talents to somehow help other people actualize their talents.
