00:00:00
MAIJA I heard it going up the… the stairs to my… I… I didn’t know that it was him because you know I was thinking it’s going to be something else but in umm… 

00:00:10
FRANK OCHBERG Ten years ago, Maija was assaulted repeatedly by a man who worked for the State Department of Social Services. Who threatened to take her child away from her if she didn’t have a relationship with him and she was terrified, intimidated and she went along with him. 

00:00:25
MAIJA …for first of all, he would over, that it was into my living room. And he went over and there was a huge (inaudible ) that I had. There was about umm… about six or seven feet tall. He just sort of started breaking in it into pieces and breaking it… 

00:00:45
FRANK OCHBERG And in a course of that relationship, there were at least a half dozen episodes of torture and of rape and she endured all this. Maija suffered from the most traumatic symptom of PTSD, painful intrusive memories. 

00:01:00
MAIJA I always… I always thought that whatever he was doing that the next thing that he did that… that was going to be (inaudible ) and the very… 

00:01:06
FRANK OCHBERG This video explains and demonstrates the counting method for recovery and mastering traumatic recollections. 

00:01:15
MAIJA Then I started screaming. 

00:01:15
FRANK OCHBERG, MD ON POST TRAUMATIC THERAPY THE COUNTING METHOD 

00:01:20
FRANK OCHBERG She and I didn’t get into the details of the six or seven episodes in which a particular individual terrorized, traumatized and raped her, until we were in the sixth or seventh month of therapy. In the beginning, it was important for me to understand more about her in general. All I had an idea of what occurred, but we didn’t go for the details. She required some medication because in addition to everything else, she had panic attacks and she was somewhat obsessed and depressed and she responded very well to the medication Prozac which I believe is often a useful agent(ph) when repetitive chronic distress has occurred and there is signs of depression and obsession as well. So, as her sense of security improved, as her ability to laugh return, as her competence as a school teacher was restored, then she was ready to remember. So, we are going to be demonstrating a technique from post traumatic therapy work that Maija and I have used in the past and we are going to do it again and I’m… I’m glad that you are agreeing to go through this. 

00:02:50
FRANK OCHBERG Maija and I developed the counting method in which I count out loud to a 100 and she remembers without speaking while I count out loud. This gives her a chance to have the privacy of her recollection, the intensity of her recollection, without needing to translate it into words for me. This method should be considered when therapist and client agreed that significant progress has occurred, but intrusive recollections remain. 

00:03:15
FRANK OCHBERG Let me ask you to choose from among in one of the episodes that we’ve talked about in the past a… a single one and as we did before our count and you’ll bring this time of your life into mine and allow yourself to feel the feelings from that time as intensely as you can tolerate. I’ll be counting to a 100, you can make the intensity, crest as I get up to 40, 50 and 60. And then, let… let that subside and when I’m in the 90s, remind yourself that you are here. 

00:04:00
MAIJA Yeah, I was like 90. It's my figure number. 

00:04:05
FRANK OCHBERG The first step is a discussion of the method and its rational leading to ideal timing. Timing refers to both the phase of therapy and to the time within the session. This way, the stage is set. 

00:04:20
MAIJA I know I am gonna come back. 

00:04:20
FRANK OCHBERG Right. 

00:04:20
MAIJA Will be alright. 

00:04:25
THE COUNTING METHOD Setting the Stage Counting Telling the Trauma Story Reflection and Closure 

00:04:30
FRANK OCHBERG I wanna just mention ah… what the… what the title of this will be? 

00:04:35
MAIJA Umm… probably my… my teeth I was um… since I’m getting new crowns but ah… like I can do that and my… my front teeth. 

00:04:45
FRANK OCHBERG Okay, good. Here, we go. 

00:04:45
MAIJA Alright. 

00:04:50
FRANK OCHBERG One, two, three, four, five, six… 

00:04:55
FRANK OCHBERG The second step is the counting. Therapist should be certain not to start the counting too late in the session. Be sure to leave enough time for the next two steps, telling a trauma story and closing with reflection. 

00:05:10
FRANK OCHBERG 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50. 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56… 

00:05:55
FRANK OCHBERG And in the course of going through the counting to a 100, oh you could just to see the torment on her face and she would hold her hands up to her eyes and she would sobbed. 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80… 

00:06:25
FRANK OCHBERG Who knows exactly what’s occurring inside her mind, but it’s very clear that she is back there. It’s… it’s very clear that… that she has been transported and by the time the counting ends, she has a certain amount of relief and yet in a way she still is so close to the torture and that she has been changed. 100. 

00:06:55
[sil.] 

00:07:05
MAIJA That was a good place to stop. 

00:07:05
FRANK OCHBERG Um… Hmm… And when it was over, she would be relieved and then she would talk. And when she talked, it was as though she had just been there and she had just been there, but I was there with her. And what she was doing was reliving the event at the same time that she was aware of being in the presence of a trusted therapist. 

00:07:35
MAIJA He grabbed me just sort of… sort of started slamming me head against the floor and I started screaming. I started screaming and he took… he took… 

00:07:50
FRANK OCHBERG Once, the counting is complete, an opportunity is offered for telling what has just been remembered. 

00:07:55
MAIJA It was it like a neat(ph) shirt that I was wearing. He just started, started stuffing it into me, into my mouth and just pounding it into my… into my mouth that I remember screaming at the same time and he can’t took part. It was like more of it would fit in and the more of it would fit in. I never… I… ah… like I could breath, but I couldn’t… I couldn’t. I knew that my mouth was bleeding and I couldn’t breathe air really well and then finally, I got when I… I sat up and… and you are not really screaming at that point, it’s kind of um… you know, just a… a throat (inaudible ). Then he sat up to beat took… I… I get at the shrewd out my mouth, but at the same time, when like I was… like I was blowing in this… a tooth… I blow a tooth it just came with… with the… blood and the others and… and that's what I’d thought, I thought that he would stop too because it seems like that would be you know… that whatever… whatever it was, that that would be you know, that he would… that he wouldn’t stop too, but he… but he… he didn’t… I never… I never started crying. He didn’t hurt I don’t remember… remember hurting, I just remember, looking awful. Would seem this… this… 

00:09:20
FRANK OCHBERG Umm… Hmm… 

00:09:20
MAIJA …this obviously, this drawn stuff on the floor and… and then I… and if he would just die and he would just that because that was enough. I was hurting but I didn’t… I didn’t to start crying because he’d always told me that… that… that it turned him on. That literally boy his words or whether it came to him hard if he saw I’m crying. And so I’ve learned that. I’ve learned that not to cry. It didn’t hurt. It didn’t hurt it all. But he didn’t… he didn’t stop. That’s why I can’t when… when I… 

00:10:00
[sil.] 

00:10:10
FRANK OCHBERG Take your time now. 

00:10:10
MAIJA I know he raped me, but I don’t… I don’t… then I took that’s when I would just leave and I didn’t… I didn’t… I… I… I just wasn’t there anymore. 

00:10:25
FRANK OCHBERG By leave, you had… you had no feelings. 

00:10:30
MAIJA No, I just and I couldn’t see anymore. I just didn’t know what was going on. 

00:10:35
FRANK OCHBERG When she recollected this episode and described the episode, she remembered that at one point, she just drifted away from herself. She had no physical feelings and she had no mental feelings. Now this is called Dissociation. It is in fact an altered state of consciousness. It’s a form of anesthesia at the time, it’s a change of… of one’s ah… awareness and focus. I believe it helped her survive. It helped her avoid the devastating ah… set of sensations and knowledge of what was occurring to her. In… In… In essence, she gave her body up while she protected her soul. 

00:11:25
MAIJA He just sort of toward this little… little person about that tall and just sort of with… with little person’s steps somewhat were… when he got off the… the end of the bed and out of the room and I don’t know often to, but moving in somewhere… 

00:11:40
FRANK OCHBERG We were using a technique that comes from Patricia Garfield’s work called creative dreaming or you can… 

00:11:45
FRANK OCHBERG Sometimes, I interrupt the outpouring of the trauma story with a comment. Usually, I listen and take notes. The telling me take minutes or most of the therapy hour. Always allow time for closure. 

00:12:00
FRANK OCHBERG … sessions, you did it and you did it with humor, everything and you do it with a tremendous amount of vindictiveness. 

00:12:10
MAIJA Hey it looked a ridiculous. 

00:12:10
FRANK OCHBERG Yeah. 

00:12:10
MAIJA It was… It was pleasant and that was… I’ve never… I have never really like had a faith to cease(ph) of… of going back and… and cutting his head off or stabbing. And I just… I don’t have that in me. I know there is a lot of… God I despise this person you know what he did was just awful, was just… was… was just awful. But I don’t have it. I don’t feel I need to do something um… vanish forward and return it. It’s not going to… it’s not going to take. It’s not going to return the years that I spent hiding. It’s not going to be… It’s not going to do anything at all and it won’t make me feel better(ph) I know, it’s… 

00:12:55
FRANK OCHBERG Well I’m grateful to you for going through this in this set. And I think we’ll probably stop now. Is there is anything else that you… 

00:13:05
MAIJA No um… what just occurred to me, you know little bit earlier we’re talking about how much you can, how much a doctor can take from a… from the… from the patient um… and I guess… 

00:13:20
 During the telling of the trauma story there may be a strong desire to comfort, to touch, to console. I noted that from Maija and the psychiatry residence. 

00:13:30
 But it get messy sometimes. It… It ah… 

00:13:35
FRANK OCHBERG I’ll tell you some other things that went through my mind. You know, a little thing the tears were… were staring to form and the tissue’s were on the other side of you. And you were capable of… 

00:13:45
MAIJA Yeah, I knew that, they were… 

00:13:50
FRANK OCHBERG But in a way I realized it well I… I… I would like to be able to give you the tissues. Ah… comforting beyond that, I don’t see a… is appropriate and I think what’s important is that you developed the ability to comfort yourself and to experience your own survival status. 

00:14:10
MAIJA But there is a great deal of comfort that comes from that you are reminding me of the survival the… the comfort of… of be able… I believe is really assuring, being able to look up and I don’t feel this ah… you know a look like that, you are right I’m, I described it very… very clearly all of the… the things that happened, the things that were done and there is… I guessed just the need that… that um… of… of not being, when these things happen to you, makes you feel pretty disgusting as a human being. Because otherwise why would somebody treat you like that. There is ah… if you are treated like that it’s because for some reason, you um… deserved it, earned it you know whatever. You know that… that’s the victim talking now, I don’t feel, I don’t feel like that now, but just testing and making sure with somebody else thinks, yeah that was pretty weird, you know that wasn’t very nice of him to… to do those things. That just, that part is um… is very… is very comforting. 

00:15:20
FRANK OCHBERG And this was something just couldn’t talk about and couldn’t think about… 

00:15:20
 Finally reflection by therapist and client places the traumatic event and it’s echo in the context of psychological health, dignity, mastery and collegiality. This begins as the telling phase ends. 

00:15:40
FRANK OCHBERG Do you have any sense now and dredging up the feeling that… that it’s positive to be able to have the feelings that’s you’re having. 

00:15:55
MAIJA Yeah because what I feel… what I feel is what we talked about before, what I feel is so angry… 

00:16:00
FRANK OCHBERG Hmm… Hmm… 

00:16:00
MAIJA I don’t feel like… I don’t feel sorry for myself. What I feel is… is really… really… 

00:16:05
FRANK OCHBERG It is bad for a therapist to unearth these feelings and then just leave them. Each therapy session requires some proactive statement by the therapist leading to closure with dignity. 

00:16:20
FRANK OCHBERG So what you did back then was you were… you were able to have no feelings… 

00:16:25
MAIJA Yeah. 

00:16:25
FRANK OCHBERG …and which protected you from being further hurt. Now you're able to have the feelings or well they are obviously painful. 

00:16:35
MAIJA Oh… 

00:16:35
FRANK OCHBERG Yeah, but there is a lot of anger there. 

00:16:40
MAIJA Yeah. Yeah there is. See before I… I… I… I think I felt… I felt sorry for myself sort of its… it’s really the um… but I… I could never really understand um… I could never understand what I… what I have done, what… what… but I know I hadn't done, what I didn’t do is what he kept saying which was, if you just give in, if you just give ing and if you just give in and I just couldn’t. I just… It was just physically impossible. I just… I just couldn’t, I just couldn’t. You know what… I… I couldn’t. 

00:17:35
[sil.] 

00:17:40
FRANK OCHBERG Now what about doing this here in this room with other people watching under the camera going. Tell me a little bit about that. 

00:17:50
MAIJA It really doesn’t… doesn’t matter. I think this morning I was um… I knew this, but I was… that this was going to happen today, but and I think this morning I was ah… I was little bit scary because it… it made me feel as if would I… would I walked into this room that I was um… I didn’t know what person to be. I… I… It’s like I said before, I sort of wanted to present myself as a… a competent professional, but I… I don’t know (inaudible I guess that’s my like my public face. 

00:18:30
FRANK OCHBERG Hmm… Hmm… 

00:18:30
MAIJA Is that, but there was an another part to that oh… if I don’t talk to everybody. 

00:18:35
FRANK OCHBERG Hmm… Hmm… 

00:18:35
MAIJA …everybody about. 

00:18:40
MAIJA Oh! 

00:18:45
FRANK OCHBERG So you are… 

00:18:45
MAIJA But it… it doesn’t feel, but it doesn’t… it doesn’t frighten me because I feel that oh I’m not looking up, I'm really very conscious that I’m not establishing eye contact with… with um… the other people in this room. It also, I also feel, I don’t feel, but that everybody is looking downward on me because of… because of this saying Oh you know… if that anybody is looking down at me, it’s a… it’s a terribly it's, that's a humiliating thing to go through, I mean it took me a long time before I… before I could talk to you about other situations that (inaudible ) today is not… is not so, is not some different um… 

00:19:25
FRANK OCHBERG And… And while this may have a certain aspect right now of embarrassment or revealing something very private. Can you think of one, you have proved, which is that you can remember something that was real and that you can be in touch with the human feelings that are normal and appropriate. What is the advantage of counting and is this going to be a technique that’s… that’s going catch on? I… I don’t know yet. I am trying to encourage people to experiment with it. There is a technique it’s been used now across the country called Eye Movement Desensitization Therapy and it was developed by Francine Shapiro and colleagues of her and it’s clearly help’s. In this case a person is encouraged to remember while the therapist moves a finger in front of their eyes and causes a… a series of eye movements that are coincident with the traumatic memory. I think we maybe tapping into the same thing. I happen to find the… the use of eye movements more contrived than… than counting. I would rather use my voice and I would rather have a… a minute and a half or minute and 2/3rds and now that I am using the same interval each time and relatively short interval. I… I think it also helps people know where the beginning and middle and end is. I think what we're doing is we’re tapping into that file draw in the brain that is used for traumatic memories and we’re inserting into that cabinet of traumatic memories the recollection of therapist and therapized(ph), doctor-patient, therapist-client and it's there right along with the traumatic memory, so whenever their draw opens, it's not just the… a frightening and lonely feeling of being alone with the assailant, it’s that feeling of having been with my therapist during this counting, is this counting that has a calm and inevitable beginning and middle and end to it and it is empowering and it… it changes forever, the recollection of the traumatic event. 

00:21:55
MAIJA Um… in response to the… to your comment on um… putting a person through it, it was funny because after everyone had left and I just turned I said boy I didn’t… I wouldn’t want to do this every day which it… 

00:22:10
FRANK OCHBERG Maija is vastly improved. She has had no traumatic memories for several years. She is helping other women to understand the healing process. 

00:22:20
MAIJA It so… because I… because I’m aware that you're there and when you get to you know 90, 91 and then I know that um… it… it’s a reminder that its safe, but it’s almost like… like… it's like seeing it again sure that’s really painful, but at least I’m… I’m seeing it with… with um… other senses… 

00:22:40
FRANK OCHBERG But she will never forget and the impact of her torture and humiliation will be part of her forever. 

00:22:45
MAIJA …actually happened there was this unreal sense except for things oh no and now this is going to happen and oh no and there is nothing that I can do about it, but as for being aware of… of other feelings or smells or colors or site there was… it was things just were so toned down until, you know up to the point where I… um wasn't there at all anymore but…. 

00:23:10
FRANK OCHBERG Cruelty is part of the human condition. It need not diminish us, it need not silence our stories. 

00:23:15
MAIJA …this way.
