child centered play therapy A CLINICAL SESSION Dr. Garry Landreth DISTINGUISHED CONTRIBUTOR TO Play Therapy 

00:01:20
NARRATOR His video, "child centered play therapy A CLINICAL SESSION" demonstrates his approach to play therapy. 

00:01:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Um, I'd like to focus with you now on toys and materials in the setting for your play therapy experience. I never accept as an excuse I don't have a place for therapy. If you have a place for an adult to sit in a chair somewhere in your office, then you have a place for play therapy. I've done play therapy in broom closets the end of hallways in classroom buildings or in office buildings. I've done play therapy in corners of classrooms and just pulled the chairs out and make a corner in the, of the classroom, the playroom and then I say to the child, "This is our special play area and all of that out there is not a part of our special play time." I've done play therapy in an end of my office and I do the same thing, "This is the play area and this is part of my office down here is not a part of the special play time." Uh, and the corner of your desk becomes a place to display the toys and the chair where the adult client would sit is a place to display the toys and underneath the chair on the floor is another shelf for toys. So you can do play therapy in many different places. I supervised an elementary counselor who served five elementary schools. And in one of those schools, uh, her play therapy sessions took place in the book room between these metal bookshelves. This much walk space the book, empty bookshelves on either side of an aisle way there, those were the shelves for the toys and this little bit of walkspace down through there was the place where she did play therapy and she worked miracles with children in that elementary school. So, um, you can do play therapy wherever you would like to. There are no, there are no restrictions. There are restrictions on, well I shouldn't say that, um, play therapy doesn't work very well outside. You wouldn't take a child out to have a play session under a tree because there are too many distractions, folks and no matter how much they beg, let's, can we go outside and play under the tree? I know you'd like to go outside and play under the tree, but this is our special play time for in the playroom. Uh, you can't accomplish as much out there as you can in here. This is a special emotional environment and what is in here, inside these walls, that's a part of the emotional environment. Out under the tree is not. So you would experience a lot of difference out there. And then there are restrictions on the toys and materials that we would select. Um, if you would turn to page six , the next page over from the, uh, response sheet there. Titled, "Toys and Materials" 

00:04:40
Toys and Materials Rule of Thumb Toys and materials should be selected, not collected. Landreth, G. (2002) Play Therapy The Art of the Relationship (2nd ed.) NY Brunner-Routledge 

00:04:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH There is an important rule of thumb. Toys and materials should be selected, not collected. The materials that you use in your, uh, experience with children should be carefully selected. Just because it came from a place labeled a toy store, like Toys-R-Us, doesn't mean it's appropriate for your playroom. All toys are not appropriate for the playroom. There's a reason why we have certain toys in the playroom and a reason why we don't have certain toys in the playroom. What we fall back on is, toys are like the child's words. Not all toys provide an opportunity for the child to express self or needs, or wants or wishes or happiness or experiences. So we would follow the criteria listed on that page in front of you. These are important questions to ask about the toys you now have in your play therapy room or for those of you who don't yet have a play therapy setting these are important questions to ask in regards to the kinds of toys to select. And folks I know that what I'm venturing into here is, um, threatening ground, uh, because without intending to, uh, I'm going to step on some toes, so to speak. Um, you may be using an item that I don't think fits the criteria, um, and I don't know how to do this diplomatically, other than to just dive in. OK? I'm just going to dive in and forgive me if I step on your toes.

Toys and Materials Do the toys and materials facilitate a wide range of creative expression? Landreth, G. (2002) Play Therapy The Art of the Relationship (2nd ed.) NY Brunner-Routledge 

00:06:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Toys and Materials. Um, do the toys and materials facilitate a wide range of creative expression? Creative expression, it's very difficult to be creative in terms of creating what has happened in your life with a deck of uno cards. How do I express how it felt when whatever it was that I experienced with a deck of uno cards? Or a spinner game, where you spin a spinner and you move the little items down the thing and whoever gets down here wins. Uh, um, how do I express, um, to you that I've spent my entire life out on the playground not being chosen and how awful that feels? How do I express that with a game called Candyland? Can't be done. You see it just can't be done. So we need to give thought to what am I trying to help this child to do and that is to live out a part of their life through their play in the same way that adults live out a part of their life through their words. So do the toys and materials facilitate a wide range of creative expression? 

00:08:10
Toys and Materials Do the toys and materials facilitate a wide range of emotional expression? Landreth, G. (2002) Play Therapy The Art of the Relationship (2nd ed.) NY Brunner-Routledge 

00:08:10
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Do the toys and materials facilitate a wide range of emotional expression? How do I express the emotions that well up in me or that I experienced earlier in my life through a structured mechanical game? Those little hand held calculator type games. How do I express a part of my life through this game that you push these buttons and try to get this thing to go over here and you can't do that. There should be no mechanical toys in your playroom, no mechanical toys in your playroom. OK, they, they don't facilitate any part of the child's life. 

00:08:55
Toys and Materials Do the toys and materials allow for expressive and exploratory play? Landreth, G. (2002) Play Therapy The Art of the Relationship (2nd ed.) NY Brunner-Routledge 

00:09:00
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Um, Do the toys and materials allow for expressive and exploratory play? That is to express self and explore, uh, pitting myself against, solving this problem for myself I don't mean in a game, but I mean in real life issues. Like what I have lived out at home when Mom and Dad scream and yell at each other. How do I express that through most board games? It, it can't be done. Um, and a crucial dimension along that line since I mentioned the board games is a the next item, number five. 

00:09:45
Toys and Materials Do the toys and materials allow for exploration and expression without verbalization? Landreth, G. (2002) Play Therapy The Art of the Relationship (2nd ed.) NY Brunner-Routledge 

00:09:45
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Do the toys and materials allow for exploration and expression without verbalization? Why do we have children in the playroom in the first place folks? And why do we want them, why do we have them here to play? Because they lack the ability to fully express themselves in the way they need to express themselves verbally. That, that is not their natural language, play is their natural language until they're about eleven-years-of-age. And then we violate that principal by having them get involved with a game that requires them to talk. Somehow that doesn't, that seems a bit incongruous to me that I'm doing play therapy because I believe children need the play to express themselves. And then I give the child a game, that requires you to talk that's incongruous and it violates the basic premise of play therapy. Now let me quickly add that, um, there are some games that can be very therapeutic with older children. Uh, the Ungame(ph) is one of those, but your games should be kept out of the playroom generally, brought in for the older children. If you have the games displayed on the shelf and a five-year-old comes in. What will, first session, what will they go to first? They will go to the games. Why? Because they saw them on TV and they don't spend all that money advertising knowing it will have no impact on children. They know how to design the ads and the board, the boxes so that it will attract children's attention. So the five-year-old goes over, pulls the game out, wants to play it. Now, what are you going to do? They don't know how to play it you have to become their teacher and you give up your role of being the play therapist. Now you've become the child's teacher. Um, and the game, most games are structured around rules and regulations. And what did we talk about earlier about play? Play is devoid of rules and regulations. True play is spontaneously created as the child goes along. Um, I think also we have to, um, ask ourselves, um, If, if we have, uh, a game, uh, and we're involved with the child in the game, are we going to play it honestly? Like checkers? There's not a one of you folks that can't beat the socks off any five-year-old in checkers. Or you should be able to. Um, are you gonna play dishonestly and let the child win? What kind of a relationship is that? This is supposed to be an honest relationship. Well, my advice to you is, if you're going to play games like checkers at least play honestly. Take only three checkers or two checkers and say to the child, "I've played checkers lots of times so to make the game fair I'll only take three," and then you play hard. You play honestly, you don't let the, folks have you ever played against somebody in tennis or some other game and you, bowling whatever, you knew they let you win. It's humiliating and children know when you're letting them win. That is not an honest relationship. So we have to examine what we have in this playroom. Um, are the items here truly facilitative. 

00:13:55
Toys and Materials Do the toys and materials allow for success without prescribed structure? Landreth, G. (2002) Play Therapy The Art of the Relationship (2nd ed.) NY Brunner-Routledge 

00:13:55
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Um, do the items or play materials allow success without prescribed structure? Most games have a, well, fact all games have prescribed structure. And to be successful you must follow the structure. 

00:14:15
Toys and Materials Do the toys and materials allow for noncommittal play? Landreth, G. (2002) Play Therapy The Art of the Relationship (2nd ed.) NY Brunner-Routledge 

00:14:20
DR. GARRY LANDRETH We need noncommittal kinds of items that don't conform to any prescribed structure in terms of how the child uses the item. Then that's much more facilitative to the child, uh, much more therapeutic for the child to express themselves with blocks or some sand or dolls than any board game you can purchase anywhere. Um, so my recommendation is, if you do use board games that you only bring those in for the older children. You take them out when the older children are not going to, um, be in the playroom. And then you avoid those kinds of problems. For, um, for the checkers I think one of the most, uh, helpful things you can do with a checker board is throw all the checkers away, keep the checkerboard. If you want to use something like that go to some, um, cake decorating place or MJ Designs or someplace like that and buy little figures: a dinosaur, a house, a person, a dog, an airplane. And the little figures become the checkers and you put blue tape on half of them and red tape on the other half. And then you play the checker game in the same way only you add this dimension. Every time you move a checker you must make up a story about that item. It then becomes a projective device, but again I don't think that kind of board game works out very well with younger children. I think it could be quite effective with older children. Um, well let's look at some other dimensions for, uh, for selecting toys. 

00:16:10
Criteria For Selecting Toys Toys should facilitate contact with the child by gaining the child's interest and attention. 

00:16:10
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Um, toys should facilitate contact with the child by gaining the child's interest and attention. I think that's just, uh, what I want to say there is there should be some colorful kinds of toys, toys that children are generally interested in. All children are interested in blocks, all children are interested in sand. Uh, if you have a playroom it would be helpful if you had a bucket of water in there or in our case we have running water. And children are able to use that very, um, creatively. 

00:16:40
Criteria For Selecting Toys Toys should facilitate contact with the child by gaining the child's interest and attention. Toys should permit reality testing. 

00:16:45
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Toys should permit reality testing. Um, what is the reality of this situation. Um, there should be some toys that, um, allow the child to express self aggressively. Um, how can you express your anger? If all you have are some cards and board games here? Children have to express it actively because they're active not passive people. Um, um, an item like the dart gun gives the child a opportunity to express self aggressively. I think a good rule of thumb in this area of aggression is there should be something in every play setting that a child can destroy. There should be something in every play setting that a child can destroy. Some children do not feel complete talking about it or coloring about it or shooting a dart gun they need to destroy something, and so egg cartons serve that purpose. Egg cartons can be smashed, stomped, torn apart, ripped, stabbed, poked holes in, painted, almost anything a child wants to do that you need to set a limit on, can be done to the egg carton. Uh, they want to paint on the walls, the wall is not for painting on the egg cartons are for painting on. Or they want to stab a hole in the Bobo with a pencil, the Bobo is not for stabbing with the pencil, the egg carton is for stabbing with the pencil. So that the child still is allowed to express that. 

00:18:30
UNKNOWN What do you say to parents who don't want guns in the playroom? 

00:18:35
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Uh. The question is, "What do you say to parents who don't want guns in the playroom?" Um, and we do get some resistance there. Um, we explain to them that this is an opportunity for the child to learn an important lesson. And the lesson is people are not for shooting. And then I will say to the parent, don't you wish the whole world knew that lesson and we're working on that. People are not for shooting. Now those of you that are elementary counselors, I know a lot of schools have the rule nothing that represents a gun in this school building. Well I'm not gonna have my whole play therapy program tossed out the window to hold out for one item. That's fine we'll do play therapy without a dart gun. But children make weapons anyway. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang with their fingers or they pick up a stick or they pick up anything and pretend it's a ray gun or something that represents something they've seen on TV. Uh, so it doesn't really, we just try to avoid the issue by saying there can't be any guns here. Uh, and yet I recognize, um, the reason for that. 

00:19:50
Criteria For Selecting Toys Toys should facilitate contact with the child by gaining the child's interest and attention. Toys should permit reality testing. Toys should facilitate exploration of self and others. 

00:19:50
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Um, there should be some toys that facilitate exploration of self and others. And that would be items like, um, hand puppets or, uh, dolls. 

00:20:00
Criteria For Selecting Toys Toys should facilitate contact with the child by gaining the child's interest and attention. Toys should permit reality testing. Toys should facilitate exploration of self and others. Toys should allow children to express their needs symbolically. 

00:20:05
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Toys should allow children to express their needs symbolically. And I think that is a crucial dimension. That, um, there should be some dinosaurs or some dragons or some sharks or, uh, family figure dolls, different items that children can use to represent a part of their life in a symbolic way that's not threatening to them. Because this is the dinosaur, this is the shark, this is not the perpetrator that I'm playing this story out about. I don't think children think that through, as I indicated there consciously. I just think it creates that kind of distancing from the reality. So that they're safe enough to go ahead and express the emotion or explore the happening. 

00:20:55
Criteria For Selecting Toys Toys should facilitate contact with the child by gaining the child's interest and attention. Toys should permit reality testing. Toys should facilitate exploration of self and others. Toys should allow children to express their needs symbolically. Toys should provide for emotional release. 

00:20:55
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Toys should provide for emotional release. The Bobo is a great toy for emotional release. Banging on the Bobo as well as loving on Bobo, some children love on the Bobo, also. Uh, but a lot of playrooms don't have any opportunity for emotional release. There's just not really anything here that allows emotions to come out. 

00:21:25
Criteria For Selecting Toys Toys should facilitate contact with the child by gaining the child's interest and attention. Toys should permit reality testing. Toys should facilitate exploration of self and others. Toys should allow children to express their needs symbolically. Toys should provide for emotional release. Toys should provide opportunities for insight. 

00:21:25
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Um, toys should provide opportunities for insight. To learn about self, not to learn how to accomplish something. Um, one of the primary things that's learned from most board games is how to win. How many of you would agree there's already too much competition in children's lives? And then they come to play therapy and the parents pay good money for it and we engage them in competition. There should, there should, there's no place for competition in the playroom. This should not be a place where you ever win or lose. It should be a place where you express yourself. If you want to set and create a game that's fine. But not a structured game that can only be won or lost. Somebody has to win, and somebody has to lose. Now that's not very therapeutic for children. Well there are three major categories of toys. 

00:22:30
Categories of Toys Real life toys: dolls, bendable doll family, doll house and furniture, nursing bottle, play dishes, small car, airplane, and telephone 

00:22:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH One category we refer to as real life toys. Such as dolls, bendable doll family, a doll house, furniture, nursing bottle, play dishes, small car, airplane, and telephone. Items that represent real life so that the children can act out or relive experiences right out of their own life. If I, if I've been involved in an automobile accident and there's no car in the playroom, how do I relive the, that? Uh, I could take a block of wood, by the way if you have some blocks of wood, children can make that into a car. But if there's no block of wood or a car; how do I relive an automobile accident? 

00:23:15
Categories of Toys Acting-out or aggressive-release toys: such as handcuffs, dart gun, pounding bench, rubber knife, inflatable punching toys 

00:23:15
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Um, there should be a second category of toys in this area. Acting-out or aggressive-release toys and that would be items like handcuff, dart gun, um, pounding bench, rubber knife, uh, the blow up punching toy that we refer to as Bobo for aggressive release. 

00:23:40
Categories of Toys Toys for creative expression and emotional release: such as crayons, newsprint, blunt scissors, pipe cleaners, popsicle sticks, Play-Doh, hand puppets, Nerf ball, Gumby, scotch tape, nontoxic glue or paste 

00:23:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH And then, the third category would be toys for creative expression and emotional release. Items such as crayons, and newsprint, blunt scissors, uh, popsicle sticks or pipe cleaners, Play-Doh, hand puppets, a Nerf ball, Gumby, scotch tape, nontoxic glue or paste. All of these items you recognize are everyday kinds of items, but we're just exclusive in the items that we select Items should be selected not collected. You don't put a box down in the teacher's lounge with a sign saying "bring your toys". You'll get a lot of junk that should be thrown away. Um, I received a call from an elementary, uh, school counselor who said, um, "Well, I have this child who keeps playing the same thing over and over." and I said, "Well, what is it the child playing?" And she said, "Well, he's been doing this for about seven or eight sessions. I've got this water toy with these little buttons and you press the button and try to make the circle go through the water and land on the shark's bill." And I said, "Why is that in your playroom?" And this person said, "Well, a friend of mine gave it to me and it was brand new." As though that's a good reason, it's new. Let's put it in the playroom. And I said, "What does it facilitate?" And there was this long pause and she said, "I guess I shouldn't have it in my playroom. "And I said, "I think you're right, take it out. It's not facilitating anything." Um, so keep those kinds of toys and materials out of your playroom. Um. 

00:25:45
[sil.] 

00:25:50
DR. GARRY LANDRETH If you will turn to the next page. There's a list of what I refer to as my tote bag playroom. These are items that I consider to be minimally necessary to conduct a play therapy session. Let me just quickly take you through this list. And we'll talk about how to use them, or how to select these items. Crayons, you don't need a box of 64 crayons. That can be too many choices. A box of 8 crayons would be quite sufficient. And when you bring the box of crayons home, you take them all out of the box. Break every crayon into at least two pieces, smash all the points and peel the paper off some of the pieces. Now I know what you just heard sounds like heresy. Everybody knows, especially elementary school people, you don't mistreat crayons. You know that's the way we grew up. Uh, but folks what does a nice, long, crayon with a point on it say to the child? What's the message? Be neat, be precise, color between the lines you can't be very creative with a nice long crayon with a point on it. Now a piece of a crayon, you can take the side of this thing and color with it and broken crayon say what? In here you don't have to be neat, and precise like you do out there. Uh, some newsprint, um, folks you can be a lot more expansive on a piece of newsprint than you can on the back of page like this. Although, I'll take that, if that's all I can get or the back of a computer printout. But I encourage you to try and get some newsprint. Go to your local newspaper, talk to the public relations person and say, "We're starting this program for needy children." Be sure you use that word. And it's called play therapy and give them a brief explanation about play therapy. About toys are like the child's words and play is like the child's language. People quickly recognize that connection and then say, "And we need some newsprint for these children to express themselves. And I understand that sometimes you have maybe what's referred as an end run or something." Um, and then what, they start out with this big thing of newsprint. It runs, it's now down to about this big. It's not big enough for them to reuse or to use anymore and they warehouse those and then sell them. They'll give you one if you go ask for it. And then you scissor off the pieces of newsprint and put them on your easel or table for children to use. Some blunt scissors, no pointed items in this play therapy experience folks. Um, I like the plastic scissors that have the little metal edge on 'em. You could even cut with your left hand with those. Try that with any other scissors, you can't do it. A nursing bottle. And folks I do mean the real thing. Not any play stuff and when you go buy your nursing bottle you buy some extra nipples because these nipples get old and cracked and glommed up with stuff. Um, if a child should pick up the bottle and say hey there's nothing in here. Sounds like you want something in there. Yeah. We can go down the hallway to the water fountain and then you can put water in there if you like. And then the child can suck on this, that is what it's for. And older children will quickly test you. A 10-year-old boy comes in and picks up and puts it in his mouth and you think he's not even looking at me. But I guarantee (ph) you he's checking you out with his peripheral vision. And if you just flinch, just a little bit, as this big old, 10-year-old boy sucks on this bottle. If your left eye just kind of closes a little bit like, ugh. You know, I'm kind of bothered; big, old 10-year-old boy sucking on this bottle. They know it and you haven't passed the test, you're not accepting. You see what is accepting? Acceptance is neither to condemn nor condone but accept. That's OK for this 10-year-old, who needs to do that at this moment. Buy some extra nipples to replace. If a child has a runny nose or a hacking cough. Then you pull out your squirt bottle that you've got set aside somewhere. Not in the play area. With a Clorox solution and you squirt that on there, and run water on it and put it back on the shelf. And it's as good as new. Um, a rubber knife that's for cutting things, cutting the Play-Doh, pretending a doll, folks this is not Christmas time. We're talking about little items. This is a tote bag, playroom that you put in a box or a tote bag and shove under your desk when it's not play therapy time. Or you carry it from agency to agency with you in conduct play sessions in, uh, class, corner of a classroom or corner of an office somewhere. A little doll, I like this one because it's all bendable, this is better than, uh, ones that have the plastic arms that move like that. Um, some Play-Doh and you put out one can at a time. You put out two cans, the kid mixes up the Play-Doh and the very next child says, I don't like it mixed. You can go through too much money buying Play-Doh. Just put out one little can at a time. Um, a dart gun, you have a choice of two dart guns, two styles on the market. One is this kind that you load by shoving the dart in and it's cocked and ready. The other kind you drop a little short shank dart in the barrel and you pull back like a plunger back here on the end. Or two little ribs on the side here come back. I prefer this because it's easier to load. The pushing muscles develop before the pulling muscles develop, so it's easier to shove this dart in by young children. But if a child needed help pulling that thing back I would assist the child in pulling that dart gun back to load it. Um, you'll have trouble finding this kind. They're hard to find. The last batch of these I found was in a grocery store and I bought all 35 of them, filled up a shopping cart. Rolled it up to the cashier and got this strange look. And she said, "What are you gonna do with all of those?" And I said, "Play with them." Well, let's see what else is on the list? Oh, handcuffs, uh, do not purchase handcuffs that only work with a key. That can be embarrassing. You know a child handcuffs himself to the doorknob. It's time to go now and you've lost the key. And so, you have to go down to the waiting room and say to the parents, "Robert will be down just as soon as the fire truck gets here with the hacksaw." Uh, so make sure that the handcuffs operate with a lever or something that you push and they drop open and release. Uh, if a child dangles these handcuffs in front of you and says, "Stand up." I say to the child, "I choose to sit here." And I offer them my hands and the child can handcuff me like this. If the child dangles the handcuffs in front of you and you stand up. What is the next thing the child will say to you? Turn around and put your hands behind your back. And they do what they've seen on TV 100,000 times. They'll handcuff you with your hands behind your back. Have you ever stood in a sandbox which is jail, to the child, you know, that's jail. And they stand you in the sandbox. Have you ever stood in a sandbox for 40 minutes with your hands, handcuffed behind your back. Your arms begin to get stiff. Pains creep up your arm, back of your shoulder, your neck gets stiff. You start focusing on your own aches and pains. How do I know that? Because I've been there and I realized this is not good for our relationship. I'm focusing more on the fact that my shoulders are killing me, than I am on my relationship and trying to be understanding of this child. Folks if the child can pretend the sandbox is the, uh, jail. He can pretend the chair I'm sitting in is the jail. So the child says, "Stand up." I say to the child, "I choose to sit here." There are times when we need to declare ourselves, and the child learns from that. It's OK to declare yourself, I choose to sit here. I know you'd like for me to stand up but, I choose to sit here. You can handcuff me like this. Um, if, um, one of the items on the list, is a piece of rope and sometimes the child will want to tie you up and there's a trick, folks. You never put your arms together like this to be tied. You always do this and then the child can tie it as tight as they want to and then when it's time to go and the child is refusing to untie you. You just simply put your arms together, release the pressure and the rope slips off. And the same thing with your legs, you don't put your legs real close together, and let the child tie you up and then you go down the hallway at the end of the session. You don't want to do that. Um, so you keep your legs apart and the child can, children have tied me up many times and at the end of the session You should always offer the child the opportunity to undo what they've done. That's good for them psychologically. If a child has, I've had children handcuff me, and forget that they had handcuffed me. That was 20 minutes ago, they'd done lived another lifetime since then. And at the end of the session when I say, "Our time is up for the day and Robert the handcuffs are still on my arms." I wouldn't say you need to take the handcuffs off. The handcuffs are still on my arm and that provides the child an opportunity to freely undo what they've done even if they choose not to. I'll take them off and not say a word about it. Um, toy soldiers, 20 or 30 toy soldiers is plenty, 60 is too many for you to pick up. Did you catch that? Who cleans up? I just answered that question. Folks think about it, this issue of who should clean up. I know that's a big issue for some of you. Why do we have children? We always come back to the basics folks. You always come back to where you start. Why do we have children in the playroom in the first place? Because they need to play to express themselves. And then at the end of the session, we say to the child clean up your expression. And the next time you will get less expression I guarantee you. Folks I would never, I would never ask a child to do something, I would not ask an adult to do. Ponder that. You never ask a child to do something, I would not ask an adult to do. Feature this, Mrs. Brown, she's in your office she has five children, husband left her, all the money is gone she's not sure where the next meal is coming from and she has been crying bitter tears. She has used up half of your box of Kleenex; some of the Kleenex are on the table. Some found their way into the trash can. There's a bunch on the floor where she missed the trash can. And now you say Mrs. Brown our time is up for today, before you leave you'll need to clean up. We would never do that to an adult, never. Why would we ask a child to clean up. Feature this, David is 21 years old, he cusses a lot would you ever say to David, while you're in this office no cuss words. We wouldn't do that. We'd say well that's David he's got to express himself. Or Robert 15 years old wearing big old boots and it's muddy outside and he's got mud on his boots and he's sitting in your office, the mud dries, dirt scrapes off on the floor. At the end of the session you say Our time is up for today before you leave there's the broom and the dust pan. We would never do that, so why ask children to do that. you don't need to make an issue out of this. My experience is children quickly regress to the mean, on this issue of cleaning up. Children who never put away anything in their life by the fifth session, when you say we have five more minutes in the playroom and then it will be time to go. Which is a warning we give at the end of every session so that the child can bring himself under control, get ready to leave. When you say that the child starts cleaning up or they'll play with something and put it back because they decided to. Which is more important? That the item is put back because you asked a child to put it back or the item is put back because the child chooses to put it back. Obviously the second, it's a much more powerful dimension. And what would you do with a child who is compulsively neat? He's mister clean, he never left anything out in his whole six years of his life and he leaves a little red car in the middle of the floor. And it's time to leave now. Would you say to that child before you leave you need to put the red car back. No we wouldn't do that. That's progress for that child. So let's allow children to regress to the mean naturally. Um, oh! While we're talking about items to pick up; for that reason since you're going to be cleaning up. No LEGOS. A child picks up a box it's got 1,500 pieces in it and they go woo. And you've got 1,500 pieces to try to find. No LEGOS, the DUPLOS work great, it's the oversized LEGO, the big ones those are great but not the little bitty miniature type LEGO things that's too many pieces to go find. Um, some play dishes, folks you don't need an eight place setting. A couple of play dishes, a couple of spoons. A small airplane and a small car We're talking about small items, nondescript items, this could be a fire truck you see, this could be the family car, it could be a police car, it could be the school bus. This is a lot more facilitative than a $6 Hot Wheels. Pretty hard to look at all those stripes on the Hot Wheel and pretend that's the family car. But this could be the family car, or a school bus or a police car. Um, a Lone Ranger type mask that's for quick identity change. Child will put the mask on and immediately they're somebody else. They're not themselves. A Nerf ball throw the Nerf ball down and it goes bloop, bloop. No tennis balls, no super balls, no rubber balls. You're working in your office folks. A child grabs the tennis ball flings it on the floor and whoop it zooms off the floor, ricochets up, knocks your Master's Degree right off the wall, instant rejection. Um, a Gumby serves, are these they are well worth the time to find. That can be mother, or father, brother, sister, baby, perpetrator. Um, uh, those other hero bendable figures it's pretty obvious. Kind of difficult to look at Aquaman and pretend that's your mother. Um, but this could be anyone. Some popsicle sticks, those are for grabbing a handful and fling against the wall they go clatter and cause no harm. Or the child can snap them and they go snap and they have this crunchy feeling to them. Or they stick them in the, uh, Play-Doh and do things with them. Um, cotton rope I've already ment-, cotton rope should be about 5 feet long. If you can't find a piece of cotton rope in a hardware store somewhere, get a jump rope, cut the handles off. Why? As long as the handles are on there it says, this is a jump rope. You cut the handles off, with the handles off it can be a snake, it can be used to tie you up. Another reason for cutting those handles off is they'll grab that jump rope swing it around, it grabs your Master's Degree jerks it right off the wall. Um, a telephone preferably a couple of telephones. There are some children who'll talk to you on the telephone and will not communicate otherwise. An aggressive hand puppet, this is one of my favorites, uh, because it's not that vinyl stuff and children can manipulate it real easily, I found this in Dillard's hardware, cookware department. It's an oven mitt, uh, and I suddenly realized, I'm looking at all these aggressive symbols in the kitchen no less. A dragon, a tiger, a lion, an alligator. I'm missing something I guess in the kitchen about all this aggression that's coming out. Um, another aggressive item would be the shark, I found this in, um, Albertson's. There's a few other places I've seen these. Um, sexually abused children will often use this item. I think it's obvious why they would. So, I'd, I'd highly recommend that item. too. Um, let's see what else, what else. A bendable doll family, you can find at Toys R Us, periodically, no special time their bendable doll family is on sale for $7 and something; otherwise most places they cost $21. That's a lot of money for a bendable doll family. Wait till you can find them on sale somewhere. Um, doll house furniture you only need bedroom, bathroom and kitchen furniture for your doll house. Folks think about it nothing significant ever happens in living rooms or on the patio. All the significant happenings in homes happen in the bedrooms, and kitchens, where you eat your meals and have arguments over the table or in the bathroom, significant things happen there. If you have extra money go ahead and buy living room furniture. That'd be fine. Get a small box, cardboard box, like so cut a door in one side window in another side marks across the bottom. That's your house now. It also serves to store all this stuff in and stick it away under your desk. Uh, some transparent tape, get the cheapest you can there should be something in every play session that a child can use it all, use it all, all the tape. Um, add to this list a box of Band-aids, and you go buy a box of 100 cheap Band-aids and you take 95 of them out. And put in a sack and store somewhere and then the child can use all the band-aids. Um, some costume jewelry, a blow up punching toy like the Bobo. Uh, you can go to Wal-Mart or K-Mart or Target and find the blow up punching toys. There's some rules about the punching toys, the Bobo is not for picking up. That's what you'd say to the child because a child will pick the Bobo up and then just naturally sock it right back down with full force. It's got 3 pounds of sand in the bottom of it. And that force with that sand there will burst the bottom out of it every time . So, the Bobo is not for picking up. The other children will do is they pick it up, swing it over their shoulder and then fling it, whoosh. And it goes sailing through the air it'll knock a wall down. The whole building may collapse. Uh, so Bobo is not for picking up. Uh, the Bobo is not, these kinds of Bobos, I'm describing to you are the inexpensive $5, $6 ones. They just won't take the force. They're not for karate kicking, uh, for a child who really knows karate. One karate kick and burst the seam out of that thing every time. As soon as you buy your Bobo you go buy what's called plastic swimming pool repair kit. It's squares of vinyl and a tube of glue. And when Bobo you come in and Bobo is sick. Uh, you pump him up and find out where the little hole is and you may have to take him home to do that and put him in the bathtub and look for the hole, the air hole and then you cut circles out of the vinyl. Do not cut squares, if you put a square on there the corners peel up and it will come off. A circle will peel up. Tricks of the trade folks. The other thing you can get to repair the Bobo is called Shoe Goo Two. It's for repairing those expensive Nike tennis shoes. The sole gets loose you squirt some of that in there put it back together, bonds it great. The Shoe Goo Two is great for seams, uh, leaks along the seam of the Bobo. Just squirt some of that along the seam let it dry and it will seal it up really tightly. In your selection of toys, there should be no mechanical toys because children become just engrossed in the manipulation of that mechanism. Um, and it doesn't meet the qualifications we've already talked about in terms of facilitating the child's exploration. No books in the playroom, children hide behind books. A child can come into your playroom pick up a book and spend 30 minutes just turning pages, looking at pictures or if they're old enough to reading the story slowly. And nothing happens in terms of them exploring a part of their life or your building your relationship with that child. Now, uh, that, I hope you won't take what I just said to mean that I don't believe in using books with children. And I do, um, bibliotherapy can be, uh, very helpful to children. But there's another place for that outside the play therapy experience and I highly recommend books to be used with children and I often recommend that parents read children a story. Uh, if children have experienced a death in the family. There are some wonderful stories out there that help children understand and to assimilate that experience. Or if they've been through an automobile accident there are books about that or loss, grief, um, unexpected happenings. Getting ready to go to the hospital for surgery, uh, and, uh, reading books about that expected experiences. Um, those can be very helpful to children, but outside the playroom. Uh, no food in the playroom, if a child shows up with a can of coke, the coke stays in the waiting room until the session is over. To allow a four-year-old to walk in your playroom with a 12-ounce can of coke. Have your ever watched a four-year-old consume 12-ounce can of coke? Uh, it works this way. And it can take 49 minutes to consume 12-ounces of coke or less. Uh, so that interferes with the process. Any food that they should show up with stays out in the waiting room. Um, if a child in the middle of the session says I'm hungry can we go down to the snack machine. Um, I know you're hungry and you can go down to the snack machine after our time is up. But we would not allow the session to be interrupted in order to go get a coke or go to the snack machine. If you have a child that is coming consistently, at the time when they should have already had a snack then you talk with Mom about giving the child a snack before the session starts. Um, and also when you meet with the parent and talk about play therapy. You would not only mention that but you'd mention take your child to the bathroom before our sessions, so that that's not a problem, as much of a problem for you. Um, if a child wants to get a drink of water and you don't have a water fountain in your playrooms like we do then you walk down the hall with them to get a drink of water. Um, if that happens a second time, um, OK, but a third or fourth they can't be that thirsty. So after a second drink of water, uh, you would probably want to say to the child, you can get another drink of water when our time is up in 10 more minutes. And surely the child can wait 10 more minutes. If they're asking to leave the room, um, too often for something like that I think you should begin to wonder about the reason behind that rather than the fact that the child may be thirsty. What is the psychological reason here? That the child may be wanting to leave or escape from the setting. If you use anatomically correct dolls in your work with children. Those should be brought into the playroom for children that you suspect may be sexually abused and kept out of the playroom at other times. You only bring them in if you suspect the child may have been sexually abused. And the reason for that is, um, some children's parents have not done a very good job of educating them about, uh, their anatomy. And a child comes in, picks up and anatomically correct doll pulls the trousers down and immediately goes oops. They get embarrassed, they feel awkward. It interferes with the relationship and you have some trouble overcoming that then. So, to avoid that you just keep the anatomically correct dolls out until you feel they are needed. Um, one of the things I have noticed about play therapists. Is many play therapists love to shop. And, um, they keep adding things to their playroom. I supervised a person like that and about every two weeks, I would go into the playroom and say we've got to clean it out again and you've been shopping too many times. Uh, but she would be out shopping, she would see something and go I, this would be wonderful in the playroom. She would add that and then the next day, she would add something else. That changes the environment, folks. That's not good for this relationship, this should be a predictable, consistent relationship and it can't be predictable if it's not consistent. That is what was there last time, is there today, and will be there next week. It's pre-, that's a part of the predictability for the child and promotes security. But if you keep adding new items the child is never sure what to expect next. Um, also you don't need additional items. You should start with what you need and then you don't need to keep adding to that. You start out equipping your room with the recommended toys. Um, I've also noticed that, um, some play therapists have a need to have a lot of the same thing they sort of seem to have the idea if one car would be good, six would be better. And that interferes with the process of children's play. Research shows that if you have six cars of a similar size and the child intended to start a story and use one car they will be drawn to use and include all six. And that changes the structure of what the child initially started to do in terms of the drama of their play. So, avoid having multiple items. A couple of little cars that would be great, six that's too many. The child will be drawn to use all of those. The same thing is true of dolls. Um, a few dolls, 15 dolls that's too many, too many choices. Um, in mentioning the dolls I need to add to that you should have multiple colors of dolls, some white dolls, some yellow dolls, some brown dolls, some black dolls. Mix those up for the children. We need to be culturally sensitive to children. If you're working with children from, uh, um, background let's say in New Mexico of the Indian culture you'd want to have some items that represent the Indian culture there. And that would be true of any other setting. I need to make a comment too about the way you organize your playroom. The playroom should look organized. It should not look like a junk pile. Uh, as I go around the country, uh, doing workshops and speaking I'm often invited to go look into play therapy rooms and I'm always eager to see the play therapy settings around the country. But, um, I'm often disappointed with what I see and recently I walked into a playroom and my first reaction was, looks like a junk pile. It was so disorganized. Children come from disorganized, confused background situations folks. When they walk into your playroom that should not be presented to them. What should be presented to them is a picture of orderliness. and predictability. Now I did not say neat and clean. Orderly um, things should be in their place and there is a place for each item. If the handcuffs are on this shelf when the child comes in they're always on that shelf. There not sometimes on this shelf and sometimes across the room in the corner on the floor over there or on that shelf. Um, children learn where items are very quickly. And so they start working out the drama of their play and they're gonna add the handcuffs and they go and they can't find the handcuffs. And they go searching for the handcuffs. That's like taking an adult and right in the middle of the adults conversation saying stop and you reach into their brain and you snatch out 10,000 words and then you say now proceed. They would have trouble going on with their thoughts and carrying out what it was that they planned to tell you. Likewise with children if the item is not there that they planned to use then you've interfered with the process of their expression as well as their exploration. So, um, toys should, um, the materials should be in their place. Uh, and, um, predictable for the child. Um, avoid, um, junking things up in a pile, in a big basket, and having three or four baskets sitting around on the floor. Then the child must go scrambling through the box to dig down in there and find what they need. The items should be readily visible to a child. Now if you're working in your office, that presents a little bit of a problem. But if you have cabinets in your office that have doors. Um, clean out what's in the cabinet there. Make the shelves your display area for your toys and when it's not play therapy time close the cabinet doors. When it's play therapy time open the cabinet doors, go down to the waiting room, bring the child in. If you don't have cabinet doors. Get some cinder blocks put those over in a corner or at one end of your office and some planks and display your items on the shelves there. And drape a curtain that you just drop over those shelves for testing times or other times when this is not going to be play therapy time in your office. Um, but he point is that, uh, the items should be readily visible. Many children come in the playroom and they're very cautious and if they walk in and the items are in a big pile over here and a basket of some kind. They are not very likely to go over there and start rummaging through looking fo what they need to express themselves. So, display the items appropriately, um. Um, you could also, uh, um, use the corner of your desk as I mentioned earlier or the chair and underneath the chair to display your items. Make sure you display in the same spot. Dolls for example might always be on the seat of the chair. Aggressive items might be on the corner of your desk. There then is a predictable place for the, um, for the child. Were there any questions that you had about toys or materials? Yes.

UNKNOWN What about dress up clothes? 

01:01:50
DR. GARRY LANDRETH The question about dress up clothes. We have dress up clothes in my play therapy rooms. I don't have those on your, um, tote bag playroom because they're too bulky and if you're trying to get everything in a box to put in a closet or underneath your desk. You won't have room for those, but if you have room for dress up clothes. Yes. If you have room for Bobo blow up toy, yes. If you have room for a sandbox, great. Um, you may not have room for a sand box, you may just want to get a Tupperware dish pan and put 2 inches of sand in the bottom of it. And children can bury in that but it's very helpful to children to have something to bury in or cover up or just the soothing quality of playing with the sand. And straining it through your hand or sifting it and pouring it through a strainer or a funnel. Uh , that can be very comforting to a child to be able to do that. If you're concerned about the sand getting out on the carpet and then you're gonna have problems with the janitor or somebody else. Um, you can use rice, children can bury in that. Um, but if you use rice, um, no water in there. That can cause problems. Uh, if you're working in a hospital setting and , uh, you need to work with children on an isolation ward where things need to be sterilized. Uh, you can use little glass beads that would go on the bottom of an aquarium. Those kinds of little beads. Those can be sterilized, paper can be sterilized. So you can get a big bag of, uh, paper holes.
