DR. PAUL SWINGLE I was very, very troubled listening to Mike this morning. At 80 years of age according to Mike, I've lost 50% of my marbles. And according to Mike the only reason to take Viagra, a guy of my age is to prevent myself from rolling out of bed at night. Very troubled. The brain tells us everything. I don't ask people why they've come to see me. I tell them why they're sitting in front of me.

DR. PAUL SWINGLE More importantly, it has a major impact on the client because it's kind of like cognitive behavior therapy. They start thinking of their problem in neurological terms. The reason I'm depressed is that there is a marker in the brain associated with functioning that gives rise to predisposition to depressed mood states. So they leave, A, with a different understanding of what their problem is and secondarily much more importantly that I know where to go to fix it. That's what they feel when I've read their brain maps. Uh… Another thing I should share is I don't like these newfangled computers. So this is the way I started. Remember BF Skinner and his pigeons and rats and so forth and cats. Well, we've built our own stuff. Okay, that's one research was really fun. Okay. Okay. 5K. That computer cost more than half of the computers in my clinic and we have like 20 of them. Okay. And uh… some of you may recall how those things were programmed. Adding Neurotherapy To Your Practice is the theme of what I'm gonna be talking about in the first lecture. Neurotherapy blends perfectly with any other discipline, whether it's uh… physician or a psychologist, social worker. Whatever your therapeutic metaphor is, Neurotherapy blends perfectly. The flipside of that is Neurotherapy is not a standalone discipline and we have a lot of trouble now with these franchises in which they give you some programs, one size fits all. And they are very, very destructive. It's kind of like going to a gym where you have all this equipment to work out and you fixate on the stationery bicycle. True, you will have benefit, but it is very, very, very different than having a look at the brain and making your treatments very specific to any anomalies that you see. 

00:03:35

00:03:40
DR. PAUL SWINGLE One size fits all doesn't bother taking your pulse. In other words, they don't bother having a look at your brain. What's wrong with your brain? Where are the anomalies? Where are the inefficiencies?

DR. PAUL SWINGLE This is uh… what a uh… the mother of a former client wrote about the intake brain assessment and you'll notice in the first uh… clip… that she had a full chapter in this book on my intake assessment. You'll notice the first uh… quote there, she tried to hand me some literature uh… assessments uh… were done on her child and I waved them away. I make a big deal out of that. You know, I don't ask anything. I let the brain tell me everything. And as you can see in the bottom quote, she said, something like uh… that uh… I… I can't read it. "One by one, he read the ratios defining my daughter more quickly, more accurately than any professional I get encountered." That's about five minutes of recording time on the brain and from that you're able to be very, very precise about why the person is sitting in front of you. So, that's what we're gonna be talking about. The reason I have this slide up is to point out that we don't have to make a big deal out of this. What we have to do is understand what you're reading when you're reading brain activity. 30 numbers up there and from those 30 numbers, I said to this woman, you have been exposed to a very severe emotional stressor, trauma. Secondly, you're depressed. Third, you're very irritable and you're having difficulty in some interpersonal relationship situation. Her chin dropped to the floor. She said, I'm going through a nasty divorce right now. The brain told me that. And the reason I have this up is all you need is a pencil and a desk calculator and you can calculate all the ratios that are necessary to be able a very precisely tell the client why they are sitting in front of you. Clinical psychophysiology, neurophysiology is relevant to a wide, wide range of disorders and some of them are listed up here, the addictions, ADD, depression, and so forth. So it has huge, huge applications. Okay. Now, the ClinicalQ. First of all, the ClinicalQ is a nor… is a clinical database. It's not a normative database. It's not based on presumptive normal functioning. There is no such I know of, Mike pointed out. These are individuals who actually come in with a disorder and what you do is you look at patterns associated with disorders such as depression and I'll give you the rational for this as we proceed. It's bottom up, that is we look at what the brain is telling us up and we go from bottom that is what the brain is telling us the symptoms, not the other way around. And secondly as I pointed out before, it's not a standalone discipline. It… It has to be supported by whatever your particular metaphor is. We look at five spots on the head, back of the brain O1. Why O1, not O2?. Well, Eugene Peniston when he did his work on alcoholics used 01 and he was able to demonstrate profound efficacy in treating alcoholics. So, we decided to go with 01. CZ situated on top of the head, that's right over the sensory motor cortex and then right across the frontal lobes, the executive portion of the brain, F3, F4 and FZ. 

00:08:45
[sil.] 

00:08:50
DR. PAUL SWINGLE The software looks like this. And any reason that you don't want to use a pencil and paper and a desk calculator, we have software suites of course that will do all of this for you. And these are the self ratings. Self rating anxiety, moody, depressed and rebellious and each one of these is represented by uh… issue the uh… uh… brain uh… markers here. Okay. The anxiety is associated with the uh… uh… ratios here in the back of the brain, the theta, beta ratios in the back. Uh… And when those ratios are under about 1, uh… 1.8 or so then that's push stress tolerance. The moody uh… anxious uh… and rebellious are all associated with the frontal cortex here. There is your marker for depression, there is your marker for umm… moody and there is your marker for rebellious. I'll be going over this in pretty substantial detail, so it will become clear as we move along. Okay, these are the uh… self ratings of uh… a 21-year-old male and the interesting thing here is we're comparing this. This is a uh… uh… the summary of the data associated with this uh… individual. But what I really want to point out is this is a normative database. This is a the full Q 20 uh… 19 sites and it's one of these situations in which, it's sent to a uh… uh… company that does the interpretation. And uh… if you have a look at what the summary is here, they missed everything. That is they weren't even close in terms of uh… being able to uh… indicate what the symptoms are associated with this person, and what they're recommending in terms of treatment totally irrelevant to the problem. So, I can't stress enough that you want to use a clinical database not a normative database. Okay. So, the ClinicalQ, it's the initial intake instrument. It is your first therapy session, you can imagine the impact you have on a client if you don't ask them anything, but tell them why they're sitting there. So, it has a marked therapeutic impact. 

00:11:55
[sil.] 

00:12:00
DR. PAUL SWINGLE Now the other uh… issue that I want to point out is that a five point analysis is not a mini Q. It is a instrument in and of itself and a lot of the uh… short versions are marketed on the basis of being a mini uh… Q. But the other thing I want to point out is it's not a party trick. When we are working with a normative database, we're working with people who actually have a manifested condition. And a manifested condition is a predisposition that has been triggered. So, if you look at the general population, there are a lot of people that have predisposition for all kinds of things, but it hasn't been manifested. So, if you go into a party and try to use this as a party trick with individuals who are not clinical clients, you're gonna be wrong. They had the predisposition, but nothing has turned the key. Now, umm… we do a lot of full Qs in addition to the uh… ClinicalQ. If you're dealing with traumatic brain injury or seizures or uh… ASD stroke and so forth, then you want the full map. And the reason you want the full map is you want to see other brains talking to itself, so the connectivity issues. Okay. Now, I'm going to be talking about some of the uh… uh… interpretive ranges here. And if you'd like uh… a print out of the interpretive ranges, uh… you can uh… email office manager at www.swingleclinic.com and we can send you a uh… the interpretive ranges. They are in the book of course and I believe, you know, individuals have access to the PowerPoint, so you probably have it anyway. Okay. It's very simple. Basically, what you want to do is see how the brain is functioning. Eyes open and eyes closed and we use a uh… cognitive challenge. So, we'll have the child read or count backwards for example. And we always test unconditioned stimuli and when we're doing the intake, uh… we do a lot of what's called brain driving. And brain driving is not like neurofeedback. It's not biofeedback. Biofeedback is instrumental conditioning. Brain driving is classical condition just like Pavlov and his dogs. But to do classical conditioning you need an unconditioned stimulus something that will affect the uh… response that you're working with. So, we always test that on the intake. For example, we're talking about uh… a uh… something that will suppress data for example, uh… frequency from three to seven cycles per second. We test that beforehand. So, that if we're gonna do classical conditioning, we have an unconditioned stimulus that will affect the brain wave in the way that we want. Okay, so at F3 and F4, we're just looking at eyes closed. At 01… uh… eyes open and eyes closed. Now, we have a lot of clinical probes. This is why we're able to tell the person why they are sitting in front of us and one of the software suites will print out these uh… indicators telling the counselor what to probe with the subject that's sitting in front of you. So for example, if the theta, beta ratio that's the ratio of three to seven cycles a second divided by 16 and 25 cycles a second, the amplitudes. And if it's above about 2.2, then you want to probe for uh… ADD. Now, there is a form of ADD that is very pernicious and that is the brain looks uh… okay at rest, you don't see anything, but when you ask the person to read or cognitive challenge, that's when you see the ADD. That is the slow frequency increases under challenge. This was discovered by George Fitzsimmons at University of Alberta. And our prisons are loaded with young men with that condition. Because the harder they try the worst it gets. Because challenge increases slow frequency in the brain. So, these are the kids that just quit. And as you know, over 50% of young males in prison show the markers for an attention issue, one of the various forms of ADD, this one in particular. 01, the main factor in this location is stress tolerance. Uh… You want to… You see a slow fast ratios sitting at around two or above. When it's much below that, this is the area in which a person can't find the switch to turn their brain off. So, predisposition to stress tolerance, addiction, poor sleep quality, so forth. 

00:18:05
[sil.] 

00:18:10
DR. PAUL SWINGLE F3 and F4, you have a cognitive issue and you have an emotional issue when you're looking at the frontal lobes. When the right side of the brain and front part of the brain is more active than the left and there are a lot of ways that can happen, that's your marker for depression. When the right has uh… the left has considerably more fast activity than the right, that's your marker for anxiety. When the right has significantly greater slow frequency, there is your marker for uh… irritability, mood disregulation and… and uh… oh okay. Uh… And uh… oppositional defiant behavior in kids. And then at FZ, FZ, what we're look at there is an area that's sitting right over the anterior cingulated gyrus and when that's hot, then you have issues associated with OCD like behavior. At the lower end of that, it's uh… uh… (inaudible )thought. You get something on your mind, it's hard to get it out. That's a double edge sword of course, depends on what gets caught in there. If negative stuff gets caught in there, then a person spirals into deeper levels of depression for example. But with athletes, sometimes we make that area hot for optimal performance because if you get fixated on jumping hurdles, okay, that's the kind of addiction you want to have. And as I said, the pros on the software uh… exactly what I was just been talking about with uh… it tells the clinician what to ask in terms of the client. And we also have a report writer, so that once you enter the numbers, it's done automatically with most of the software suites. Then it will pump out a uh… report for the client, summarizing the kinds of things that you're gonna be talking to the client about. And when that's done blind, they get a report, they haven't said anything to me about why they are sitting in front of me and I give them a report describing what are their symptoms. That's the accuracy of the ClinicalQ. Okay. Now, Mike had lot to say about this, this morning and I can only underline what he said and that is the label means nothing. It doesn't tell us what the problem is, it doesn't tell us where to go to fix it. And our whole industry is wrapped around testing and putting labels on things. When in fact that's the least valuable of anything that we can… can be doing. We want to treat the neurology not the label. What is the reason this person is sitting in front of you? Well, the reason they are sitting in front of you is that they can't sleep or they're depressed or they have no motivation and labeling it is unimportant, other than for financial reasons. Now, what's the big deal about clinical versus normative database? Well, if you have a look at some of the identical twins studies, monozygotic twins, if one monozygotic twin has manifested schizophrenia what's the probability that the second monozygotic twin will have manifested schizophrenia? Well, it's about 50%. But the interesting statistic is 50% won't. Now, the schizophrenic ends up in my database, clinical database, but where does the identical twin without manifested schizophrenia appear? He appears in the normative database. Meaning, that the normative database is blind to this condition. And the normative databases are based on people who declare no symptomology and they have been symptom free for a period of time. But all of these people have predisposition for all sorts of things. So, you may have a predisposition for depression, but never be depressed a day in your life because nothing has turned the key. You have a marker for that. You end up in the normative database. A person who has the same predisposition, but it's manifested turns up in the clinical database, meaning that the normative database is statistically blind to that condition. Now, the market is that the normative database is very unhappy with me because I pointed out this error in logic associated with the problem they have with being able to discriminate a particular kinds of psychological conditions. And as I showed in an earlier slide when you look at the report of the normative database, they miss all of the clients self-reported symptoms, every one of them. Okay. The bread and butter of a lot of Neurotherapy practices, attention deficit and learning disorders. I have a book, when the ADHD diagnosis is wrong and this is an example of it right here. This is a kid that was brought in for an attention problem. And having a looking at the ClinicalQ, he has a very, very minor issue in terms of excessive slow frequency uh… uh… activity over the uh… central motor cortex. The cut off is about 2.2, I think he's sitting at 2.3. So, I knew that wasn't the issue for the severe condition that this parent was talking about. But the ClinicalQ indicated to me that there was a very high probability that this child was afraid. He was in some sort of situation that was generating what we call a trauma marker. Secondarily, he has a marker for reactive depression, that's down here. And a reactive depression is as you know something that's going on around you, you know, a pet dies, you are depressed and you're supposed to be depressed. So, you never want to treat a reactive depression and if you medicate a reactive depression, then you're gonna have a problem for life. So, this kid showed the trauma markers and he showed a reactive depression marker and one of the thing here, this is that uh… mood volatility marker. So, this is the kind of kid that have a bully came over to him and went, he'd start crying. So, he was a magnet for bully. This child, it turns out, I was a 100% correct, this child was being seriously bullied, was afraid to tell his parents because of usual bully stuff, you know, if you tell your parent etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Uh… Parent was completely unaware of this and uh… went to school and I said… as I always say to the mothers, you are the mother, you outrank everybody, okay and they feel that's quite empowering because a lot of mental health professionals don't really uh… support that notion. 

00:27:00
[sil.] 

00:27:05
DR. PAUL SWINGLE Okay, depression. The marker for depression is when the right pre-frontal orbital cortex is more active than the left. That's your marker for depressed mood states. And there are a lot of ways that, that can happen. This is a topo in which uh… here you have a lot of slow frequency sitting over the left, meaning the right is more active, there's your depression marker and a lot of fast activity in the back of the brain is your anxiety marker. So, in the back of the brain your theta beta ratio to be sitting up around two and when it's much below that, that's poor stress tolerance. And we'll be talking a lot about this when we're talking about the treatment of emotional trauma. So, here are your depression profiles and these are the ways that the uh… right side of the… of the front part of the brain is more active than the left. Obviously, if beta is greater in the right row and if to the left, there is a marker for depression. If the slow frequency either alpha or theta is greater in the left row and if to the right, then the right is more active than the left. Theta, beta ratio uh… higher in the uh… left relative to the right where there is a little more uh… fast frequency in the right and a little more slow frequency in the left then your uh… again the right is more active than the left. 

00:28:55
[sil.] 

00:29:00
DR. PAUL SWINGLE Now there is a form of depression or what people call depression which is really not depressed mood state. And this is an anxiety profile. When the individual has severe problem with stress tolerance, they will report that they're depressed because they feel out of control. They don't feel that they're able to manage them… their life properly. And if you medicate that, of course you're gonna have a problem as well. Because it has nothing at all to do with what we understand depression to me. This is a case of not being able to cope because of… you can't find the switch to turn your brain off. Bipolar. People have walked in with a diagnosis of Bipolar, always have elevated alpha in the front part of the brain. This is a form of ADD, high frontal alpha form of ADD. And it gives rise to flightiness, talkativeness, a lot of mood fluctuation. Any idea which gender goes on diagnosed with this condition? I see a lot of women in their 40s and 50s whose careers are just in the trenches because they have this form of ADD and they were considered, you know, very social, nice, little uh… but not too bright little girls. And that's what they embrace in terms of how they see themselves, how they talk to themselves, their core emotional belief. Bipolar conditions usually has the high frontal alpha that is where alpha uh… violates the uh… the algorithm and the algorithm is beta is the lowest amplitude, alpha is the second highest amplitude and theta is the highest amplitude and when you violate that algorithm where alpha as you can see is uh… has greatest amplitude of all of the wave forms, that's your ADD uh… high frontal alpha form of ADD. But the issue here with the Bipolar uh… is the fact that it's a mood volatility, mood fluctuation and then they have a marker for depression. Here it is right here. So, uh… this is the… these are the two things that uh… old people are walking with Bipolar have. They also have poor stress tolerance which is a theta beta ratio on the back of the brain is very low. And this is a mood uh… volatility. Uh… So, the treatment of Bipolar, a lot of people claim it's a uh… a condition that can only be maintained with lifelong medication, just simply not true. It's a combination of these things, these conditions. 

00:32:10
[sil.] 

00:32:15
DR. PAUL SWINGLE Okay. Cognitive behave therapy in any depressant and combined. All of them show durability for treatment of anxiety in youth. And you know, if you have a look here, uh… the medication and cognitive behavior therapy have about the same response. 

00:32:45
[sil.] 

00:32:50
DR. PAUL SWINGLE Uh… Combined uh… in the short term at least is uh… a better hit rate. Uh… After 36 weeks, they're all about the same. Okay. So, although it seems to make sense, if you want to you know get a leg up on it quickly that you do both cognitive behavior therapy and (inaudible ), but in the long haul it will be about the same after a couple of months. But if you look at six years later, we have our remission rate uh… I'm sorry uh… uh… uh… rate of 50% of people who uh… uh… fall back into the… in the uh… same condition, the uh… anxiety disorder. This is on a six year follow up. So, the hit rate is not particularly good. It looks… It looks good in the short run, that is up to three or four months but if you look out of ways, the uh… uh… the uh… problem uh… reemerges in about 50% of the uh… uh… children, 50% relapse. Now, if you look at neurotherapeutic treatment, outcome data, it's pretty compelling. Uh… And the uh… you know fairly long follow up periods here. 

00:34:25
[sil.] 

00:34:30
DR. PAUL SWINGLE Uh… This is the Peniston Study. Uh… One that was done at Fort Lyons and this… these were uh… uh… incarcerated, not incarcerated… these were hospitalized alcoholics uh… at a veteran's hospital and uh… he's the one that did that uh… breaking… breakthrough research pointing out effectiveness of Neurotherapy in… in dealing with severe addiction. And a relapse rate as you can see at the two year period is remarkably good. Okay. The data are very sobering. Uh… This is the Basel (inaudible ) (inaudible ) between 50%and 60% of the children have been exposed to trauma level stress and there are several studies that indicate that. So, one of the presumptions that you make with any child that walks through the door is that you're dealing with somebody who has been exposed to a severe emotional stressor. If you look at sexual abuse, it's 25% for females, about 18% for males, sexual abuse itself. And if you add the witnessing, murders and so forth, you know, you're dealing with at least half of the population. And emotional trauma uh… obviously we have issues associated with post-traumatic stress disorder. Uh… In other condition that I refer to as pseudo seizure disorder. These are individuals who demonstrate all of the characteristics of… of having seizures. Sometimes they look like full blown myoconic seizures, sometimes they are just fainting. And uh… there is no epileptic form and no uh… EEG activity associated with any seizure condition. And these are people who uh… the seizure is a way of blocking the emergence of the emotionality associated with some trauma. So, it's kind of a form of posttraumatic stress disorder. So, instead of having flashbacks these people have seizure activity associated with bad(ph) experience. Okay, Braindriving. Now Braindriving as I said is a classical conditioning as opposed to neurofeedback instrumental conditioning. And there is nothing new about this. Chagas in uh… 1940s at McGill University demonstrated that uh… you can classically condition brain waves. This is an alpha wave and the unconditioned stimulus, it's a suppression of alpha is light and sound has no effect on… on alpha, at least the sound he was using. So, if the first trial there uh… you can see that the uh… sound has no effect on the alpha waves and you know, they pair the light with the sound and after a number of pairings, uh… if you just turn on the sound, you get your suppressed alpha. So, that's the principle of Braindriving. You're using classical conditioning on the brain. It follows all the rules of classical conditioning. This is simply time, so if you're very punctual and very uh… disciplined in terms of turning on the unconditioned stimulus uh… every 20 seconds for example, after a number of pairings, at that 20 second mark without the unconditioned stimulus, you'll get a… a suppression. You'll get the classical conditioning effect. Braindriving preparation. Here we're… I'll be talking about all of these things. We're using electrical stimulation of acupuncture points, using sound, we're using light and the person has control of the intensity. And the reason for that is, if you're dealing with somebody who has panic disorder for example and you suddenly turn on an unconditioned stimulus, you're very likely to precipitate a panic disorder. Just give them the controller, problem solved. Okay, because they can control the intensity of the uh… unconditioned stimulus that you're using. These are goggles that have lights around the periphery, so we can deliver uh… unconditioned stimuli in the form of light flashing uh… at particular frequencies and you can look through the glasses, so we can do what we call tasking with children. If a child has problems with reading for example while we're treating the areas associated with the reading, the child is actually reading. So, it's extremely efficient in terms of… of increasing skill sets, and reading uh… writing, arithmetic and so forth. Okay, this is a developmentally delayed eight-year-old child. This is the first sample of writing and again, we're using Braindriving here. So, we're driving an area of the brain while the child is actually uh… printing or copying. 

00:40:35
[sil.] 

00:40:40
DR. PAUL SWINGLE And you can see how that's developing. Okay, so uh… that was uh… about five sessions. Now, the advantage of… of Braindriving is you can use it with any population. One of the problems with neurofeedback is that there is an issue associated with volitional uh… behavior, and that is the ability to be attentive to the screens. Okay. And what we do with children with the regular feedback is basically they are playing a video game with their brain. So, when the brain is doing what we want it to do, I can't move on the screen and you make it into a game format. But if you're dealing with a demented uh… adult uh… or a very young child, this is a nine-month-old child with uh… West Syndrome which is a uh… infantile seizure condition that can be fatal. Uh… These are people that uh… flew into uh… Vancouver and stayed with us three months and the number of… of uh… seizure free days that this infant had when he arrived was zero. He was having eight or nine seizures a day. And by the time they left, it was a 100% seizure free. And what we were working there is the sensory motor rhythm, 13 to 15 cycles a second over the sensory motor cortex, that's what we were doing. And when he came in his uh… theta SMR ratio was greater than 10. We want it below about four and when he was uh… finished with treatment, his best was sitting at 323 and uh… his average was about five. But he was seizure free. This is a tear jerker, Genetic Degenerative Brain Disorder. Uh… You're not gonna cure the degenerative brain disorder. And what the parents wanted is they wanted to have a relationship with this child prior, you know, before the child died and the usual way of treating this is you sedate the child and keep them asleep until they die basically. So, these people did not want to medicate the child. So, the uh… we did exactly the same thing, the theta SMR ratio up of the sensory motor cortex. All of this comes from Barry Sterman as many of you know, who is the guy that discovered the treatment for seizures, many moons ago. Okay. So, the post-treatment was the child was alert many seizure free days, regained partial use of uh… arms and died I think 16 months later. 

00:43:45
[sil.] 

00:43:50
DR. PAUL SWINGLE A mother was very, very nasty to me. Okay. These are vibrating animals. So, that when we can… the child can be holding it then the uh… animal will vibrate as a reward. And I had this feeling that if the little one is good, big one is better right. So, I bring this sucker in and the child is this big and the bear is that big and she said, you're not putting that in, uh… putting that in the same chair with my… my little child. So, I got the notion that you shouldn't frighten the child with the unconditioned stimulus. Okay. So, we also stimulate acupuncture points again as a function of what the brain is doing. So, it's all contingent on brain activity. This is the heart meridian. Uh… I was trained in acupuncture in Shanghai about 25 years ago, uh… needling. I used electrical and it's tied again to the brain. And the heart meridian uh… there is me punishing people. Okay. So, here is alpha braindriving and what we're trying to do is increase the strength of alpha in the back of the brain. Now, when you close your eyes, there should be a big jump in alpha in the back. Uh… When it's blunted such as this, it's usually your marker for trauma. Uh… And it also is associated with uh… your slow frequency activity as well, that's theta. So, this is a 70-year-old woman who has a trauma marker and her complaint was sleep problems. And what we're doing here is uh… stimulating the heart meridian uh… when alpha is below training threshold and we are stimulating with 10 hertz activity that is lights that are pulsing at 10 cycles a second, uh… when alpha is above training threshold. So, we call this a push grab protocol. Uh… You can then train the brain if you have a flashing light at a specific frequency, the brain will produce a wave form associated with that frequency, it's called entrainment. So, if you push alpha above your training threshold with the heart meridian and then once it's above threshold, you turn on the lights to try to hang on to it. So, that's kind of that the procedure that uh… is used in braindriving. And you can see uh… after one session here uh… that the percent that increase here is uh… 8% and uh… at the treatment at 17% and at the second 10 minutes, it's sitting at 40 uh… and 53. At this location, we want it above uh… uh… 50%. So, this is the effectiveness of braindriving. It's a very aggressive procedure and it has typically very, very uh… excellent results in the short term and then I usually end up uh… the last few uh… office sessions with neurofeedback which is a volitional procedure to stabilize what we've… what we've been able to accomplish with braindriving. Okay, uh… here is a beta down profile. And again, you can see the uh… changes that are taking place here. Uh… And again we're using the heart meridian. We're using eight cycle a second lights and… and three cycle a second lights. One is, when it's above threshold and the other is when it's below threshold. So, this is a combination of a lot of unconditioned stimuli that all have an effect on the brain and it's all uh… tied directly to brain activity. So, when it goes above training threshold, we turn on uh… stimuli that will hold the wave form that we want and when it's below training threshold, we use something to push it. Okay. That's the braindriving procedure. A lot of examples of this. Uh… Here we're getting changes of 60% in the theta, beta ratio in the back of the brain in one session. That's huge. Okay. Now, because we're pushing it, it's not gonna stay there, obviously it will come up and then it will start to decay, but it won't go back to where it was. So, we do a fair amount of braindriving and then stabilize it with regular neurofeedback.

DR. PAUL SWINGLE You can use braindriving a lot of different… for a lot of different conditions. Uh… We have a lot of folks that have had stroke automobile accidents uh… the various palsies and so forth. And what we do is we use a wireless system, so that the person can be walking in parallel bars for example uh… or doing other kinds of exercises while the brain is under treatment at the area associated with uh… their condition. So, up over the motor strip for example uh… the individual, the brain is being treated while they're actually ambulate… ambulating. Okay. This is a client who was in an automobile accident, was in a coma for a very long time. Uh… The uh… family was told that he will be vegetative, if he survives and he will not be able to uh… take care of himself in any form whatsoever. Here he's accepting the uh… Courage To Come Back Award. That's in there. Uh… And… 

00:50:35
[sil.] 

00:51:05
DR. PAUL SWINGLE And there were a lot of milestones with this fellow. You know, he came in and… and to the office first with a walker and then he got rid of the walker, he had a cane and when he got rid of this cane, what a celebration. You know, he brought it in and mimicked using it and then he threw it, you know, down and walked through the waiting room and he… we uh… he asked us to do some work on his arm. You noticed that spastic arm and he said, it's very important to me that you fix the arm and uh… he uh… shared with me that what he wanted to do would be able to take the bra off his girlfriend. So, all of my technicians are female, so I asked for volunteers, okay to do the tasking. 

00:52:05

00:52:10
DR. PAUL SWINGLE Can I have the first one? 

00:52:15
(inaudible) 

00:52:20
UNKNOWN And I just wanted to tell you, thank you very much. It's 10 o'clock (inaudible ) day, I am still feeling something, I never felt in my life, to complete lack of fear. I was able to walk all the way down the hill yesterday. I am looking forward to seeing you tomorrow and I'm feeling more encouraged and more hopeful than I've had a long time. I just wanted to thank you and I (inaudible ) to you seeing you tomorrow, thanks. 

00:52:46
DR. PAUL SWINGLE That was a treatment failure. 

00:52:50
[sil.] 

00:52:55
DR. PAUL SWINGLE As the psychiatrist who I was working with told me, she said, Paul never, never take away a symptom until you know the whole context of the client. This is when I was at the McLean Hospital at Harvard. And uh… this was uh… a woman who had severe phobia and uh… was not able to uh… leave hospital grounds. She was in a day program, but lived on… on the hospital grounds and this was one treatment that was the call I got and she never came back. Because I threatened her life, okay. She would have to give up her daily activity. She would have to give up her friends. She would have to be functioning and get out of the hospital context. And we used to call out when I was doing an internship at the VA hospital. We have a lot of uh… vets who were as we say institutionalized. We used to call that the pick and shovel syndrome. And that is, if they're functioning, they have to go to work. This was a similar kind of situation in which my enthusiasm of using braindrive and to blow things away, I blew it away and I really harmed this individual because she's become more… I assume become much more resistant to treatment because of what I did. Okay. The second one. 

00:54:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). I am not going to able to make at 9 o'clock. 

00:54:45
(inaudible) 

00:54:50
UNKNOWN I will call to make appointment from next week. Goodbye. 

00:54:55
DR. PAUL SWINGLE This is a traumatic brain injury. And after 10 sessions. 

00:55:05
UNKNOWN Doctor (inaudible ). I'm calling to make an appointment for next week. Uh… Thursday at 11 O'clock. If that's not good, could you give me a call back and let me know which would be a good time? Thank you. 

00:55:20
DR. PAUL SWINGLE Okay. That's treatment of traumatic brain injury, you know, speech complications, 10 sessions. That's the kind of thing you can do with braindriving. Very, very powerful technology. We do a lot of work developing unconditioned stimuli for the braindriving procedure and unconditioned stimulus again is something that will affect the response in a particular way. Uh… Light for example will suppress alpha. OMNI is something that we use for some forms of attention deficit disorder. This comes from Siegfried Othmer, but it nicely demonstrates one form of ADD and this is where the slow frequency has higher amplitude and the fast frequency has lower amplitude than a person without that condition and that's just theta-beta ratio. The ratio of three to seven cycles a second divided by 16 to 25 and you want that below about two or so uh… up over the sensory motor strip. Now, we developed a sound that can do that and basically the uh… uh… what it is, is we have a lot of tones that are embedded in a filtered pink(ph) noise. So you can't actually hear the tones because they're again embedded in this pink(ph) noise. Uh… And this is what kind of suppression we get of theta. These are uh… uh… college students, female college students reported symptoms. This is the adult ADD, child ADD and traumatic brain injury and you can see that uh… we're getting suppression rates of anywhere from about 13% up to about 25% and that's simply by exposing them to this particular sound. So we can use that both as a home treatment. One other things that we do for kids with ADD is we have them use the OMNI harmonic at home while they are doing their homework. So it's just playing softly in the background. And this is particularly useful for that pernicious form of ADD where effort gives rise to elevated slow frequency, making it very difficult for the child to try to uh… uh… study. Umm… And then… And when we're using it with braindriving of course, when we're trying to suppress that slow frequency, every time the slow frequency crosses, the training threshold, we turn on the OMNI and it suppresses it. This is a very good news for 80-year-old guys who've lost 50% of their marbles. Okay, according to Mike anyway. One of the problems with aging is your alpha slows down and alpha peak frequency is a very important marker for brain efficiency. Uh… When the alpha peak frequency is… is high, the frequency is high, everything works better. Antidepressants work better, antianxiety medications work better, your immune system is uh… uh… improved. Uh… And uh… obviously cognitive functioning and uh… declining uh… alpha peak frequencies in age related issue. So, one of the treatments we do for people of my age is keep your alpha fast. But one of the nice things about the OMNI harmonic is this is fast alpha here and this is slow alpha. So, what this is doing is it's markedly increasing the amplitude of the fast alpha. So, it's very, very useful in terms of uh… cognitive efficiency. And again that here is something that we give people of my age uh… OMNI to use at home while they're reading. Just have a playing softly in the background to uh… help mitigate age related declines in the alpha frequency.

01:00:05
DR. PAUL SWINGLE Mary Jo Sabo about 20 years ago, now I guess, yeah uh… used the my OMNI harmonic in what she called safe rooms. Uh… She was in charge of uh… some of the schools in uh… in uh… Yonkers, New York for very troubled children and rather than send the child down to the principal's office every time they acted up, she developed what she called safe rooms. In the safe room, you went to a place uh… where you'll buy yourself and she had them listen to the OMNI harmonic when they were in there and when they felt they could manage, they come back to the classroom. So that's much, much better model than the uh… other models that are used. And she found that uh… the use of OMNI and in another case serene really helped the children learn how to self-regulate and they did the same thing at a school in uh… Kansas City, tender loving care. Here, uh… he was using serene which uh… increases slow frequency to quiet and uh… the time uh… in uh… in the safe room before they introduced serene was just a bit over 11 minutes and when they used serene, it's just under eight and the number of reduction in the number of uh… of visits to the uh… safe room decreased by, I think he said 10%, okay. So, the use of these harmonics to uh… uh… to uh… modify brain activity something that can be done outside the office context and it's a way to maintain the gains that you make in office. Okay and this book "Adding Neurotherapy to Your Practice" uh… has all of the uh… the data associated with uh… uh… the uh… probes and we have a database of over 1500 in the uh… ClinicalQ. This one you've seen. This is uh… "When the ADHD Diagnosis Is Wrong". And fully half of the children that are brought in with an ADD issue don't have an ADD issue at all. You know, they have some other condition that's interfering with their ability to pay attention. And what we do is throw the wastebasket diagnosis at them, ADD and then medicate them and they really do have a problem. And to receive a uh… a free downloadable copy of OMNI, just uh… send to the office manager uh… at www.swingleclinic.com and they'll give you the code so that you can download a copy of OMNI and try it out in your practice or in your schools if you'd like. Thank you.

UNKNOWN (inaudible ). Just for a second, hold up. . What questions might you have for Dr. Swingle? I also noticed that, I think we're supposed to be getting some smoothies for a mid-afternoon snack, so hang in there for the smoothies. But for the mean time, questions for Dr. Swingle. Yes, please. Can you go up here where the mic please? 

01:03:55
UNKNOWN I just want some clarification. You said something about Bipolar and then you said something about ADHD or ADD, a form of Bipolar. So, are you saying AD… ADD and ADHD are in that Bipolar realm or… 

01:04:10
DR. PAUL SWINGLE No, umm… a uh… condition that we find with a certain form of ADD is something that we also find in Bipolar Disorder. So what it is, is emotional volatility. 

01:04:25
UNKNOWN Okay. But, so there is ADD and emotional volatility and Bipolar? And that's Bipolar. 

01:04:30
DR. PAUL SWINGLE Yeah, when you have elevated alpha in the front, in terms of the ADD factors, it's probably more planning organizing, sequencing, following through on things. 

01:04:45
UNKNOWN And then you said, oh, I'm sorry, you… 

01:04:45
DR. PAUL SWINGLE On the emotional side, it's emotional volatility. 

01:04:50
UNKNOWN Okay. And then you said something about females having this type of Bipolar? 

01:04:55
DR. PAUL SWINGLE No. 

01:04:55
UNKNOWN Oh, no. 

01:04:55
DR. PAUL SWINGLE Females that have the high frontal alpha form of ADD. 

01:04:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

01:05:00
DR. PAUL SWINGLE When undiagnosed. 

01:05:00
UNKNOWN Go undiagnosed with ADD. 

01:05:00
DR. PAUL SWINGLE That's correct. 

01:05:00
UNKNOWN Okay. Thank you. 

01:05:05
UNKNOWN I have a question for you sir. Umm… maybe. So, you talked about theta-beta ratios. Could you talk a little bit about how they change over with age developmentally? 

01:05:20
DR. PAUL SWINGLE Yes, umm… when you are very, very young, you are bathing in slow frequency. So, you have a lot of slow frequency uh… delta and theta activity and as you get older, the amplitude of the slow frequency starts to decrease. And then when you get to the 80 plus, then you go back into increasing slow frequency unless you do something like stamp it down and uh… Mike's notion or metaphor that uh… 80-year-olds lost 50% of their marbles, that's because it's elevated slow frequency.
