Chapter Selections from: Stress Relief with Dr. Russell Greenfield 20 Ways to Manage Your Stress Chapter 1 Introduction 

00:00:10
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Hi, I am Dr. Russell Greenfield. I am a conventionally trained physician, an RD(ph) real Doc. Even when our health is well addressed from the physical perspective we are often left with gaping wounds that are emotional and spiritual in nature. Add to that, soaring(ph) healthcare premiums. 

00:00:25
70% of patients come to Primary Care Doctor with Stress-Related Illness 

00:00:25
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD And that up to 70% of patients come to the Primary Care Doctor with the illnesses that are in some way Stress-Related and it looks like the perfect storm of healthcare. 

00:00:35
Chapter 2 What Stress Does to Us 

00:00:35
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Stress increases inflammation in the body. 

00:00:40
1) Stress impacts sleep 2) Stress impacts immune system 3) Stress causes weight gain 4) Stress negatively affects mood 5) Stress increases inflammation 

00:00:40
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Now certainly this is important for inflammatory disorders like arthritis. But did you know that at its fundamental basis, cardio vascular disease is an inflammatory disorder. Such that we can actually have an impact to lessen the instance of heart attack and stroke simply by finding appropriate ways to manage our stress. 

00:01:00
Chapter 3 How Stress Manifests 

00:01:00
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Chronic unrelenting stress can lessen effectiveness of the immune systems so the kids can be more open to getting that cold or flu that’s going around. When you find these symptoms in your child, be open to creating that space that is without fear, without judgment so the child can come to you and speak about the stresses ongoing in their lives. With yourself take a look in the mirror and give yourself permission to say Gosh am I under this kind of stress that might be actually causing these symptoms. 

00:01:25
Chapter 4 Stress in our Children 

00:01:30
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Kids need some free time just to be kids not too much TV time not too much time for other computer, the Game Boy because those kinds of games can actually increase stress in our kids even though they like them so much. So limit screen time. But laugh with them in watching comedies, playing games, exercise getting adequate sleep. 

00:01:50
Chapter 5 Managing Our stress 

00:01:50
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Any practice of stress reduction starts with kindness. And what I mean is kindness towards ourselves. So give your permission to try new things, to explore new modalities that might help to manage the stress in your lives and thereby stay healthier. So we're gonna talk about some of those different techniques might be and we're gonna divide them into three different categories. 

00:02:10
Chapter 6 Breathing 

00:02:10
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD And I love teaching this to people because it means I get to do it. This is called the 4-7-8 breath. This is a quiet inhalation through the nose to a count of four, holding the breath to a count of seven and exhaling a little bit noisily to the count of eight. The entire time that we're doing this replacing the tip of our tongue behind our upper teethes right where the teeth and gums meet like this. You don’t have to press hard just let it relax there. 

00:02:35
Chapter 7 Meditation 

00:02:35
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD And what’s nice you don't necessarily have to sit still to mediate. You can meditate while walking you can mediate while eating you can meditate while gardening. Anyone of these techniques can work. And there is a lot of different ways to learn how to meditate of course. You can attend classes, read books, and I would tell you from my own experience I was a little skeptical when I first learnt meditation. I though I like baseball, basketball and football there was no way I'm gonna want to do this and yet I found as I learned it over a little bit of time, over weeks, I found that I was much more relaxed. 

00:03:05
Chapter 8 Meditation Exercise with Dr. Joe Parisi 

00:03:10
DR. JOE PARISI Taking in another deep breath, and again a very slow exhalation this time bringing your awareness to your jaw allowing your jaw to drop, for your lips to part as much as they might wish and for that part your body to relax. 

00:03:30
Chapter 9 Exercise 

00:03:35
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD But did you know that exercise is probably the premier the best stress buster that there is. It’s true and there is very good research in this regard. People who participate in exercise on a regular basis even if they don’t increase their fitness level per se, actually have less stress less sense of anxiety and seem to do better health wise. 

00:03:50
Chapter 10 Muscle Relaxation & Laughter 

00:03:55
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD You know in some forms of body work there's the theory that trauma's, tensions, anxieties are not only held up here in our mind but actually held in the muscles as well. And so doing this kind of practice stretching, tensing, releasing that tension in the muscles can release some of the stress that builds up on our body and help manage that tension and anxiety in our lives. 

00:04:15
Chapter 11 Spirituality 

00:04:20
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Really a spiritual practice is anything that puts us in contact with something greater than ourselves. It puts us in touch with possibility. With our own personal meaning of our lives and again the research shows very interesting data. People who participate in a regular religious practice for example have a lesser instance of recurring cardio vascular disease and stroke. 

00:04:40
Chapter 12 Traditional Chinese Medicine 

00:04:40
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD But they also often offer acupuncture of acupressure. And this is manipulation of chi through a very specified points on the body. Because this is believed that Chi runs through channels of energy all along the body and that by manipulating specific points we can manipulate the Chi and relieve certain symptoms. Now Chinese medicine is typically used as a compliment to good conventional western medical care. 

00:05:05
Chapter 13 Yoga & Tai Chi 

00:05:10
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Yoga in and of itself is not a religious practice, while it can be used as such. Most people use it as a way to deepen their own spiritual practice or just their own relaxation. It doesn’t have to be a religious practice. 

00:05:20
Chapter 13 Yoga & Tai Chi 

00:05:25
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD It is another beautiful practice of flowing movements tied to breath and to meditation. It is been used to help prevent falls and to lessen hip fractures and has also been shown to lower blood pressure and again to effectively manage stress. 

00:05:40
Chapter 14 Nutrition 

00:05:40
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD So it doesn’t mean that you have to be a vegetarian. But we'd like you to cut back on red meat and dairy products to some degree. And instead enjoy some of the other options like fresh fish, lots and lots of the varied colors of fruit and vegetables try beans explore the taste of soy. All different kinds of (inaudible ). 

00:06:00
Chapter 15 Steam Cooking with Chef Phil Anderson 

00:06:00
CHEF PHIL ANDERSON And there we go a steaming protects food so you have a much more delicate texture you retain way more nutrients and minerals than you do in other forms of cooking. So when you're feeling depleted you can replenish and nourish yourself. Steaming is a stress free way of cooking. 

00:06:20
Chapter 16 Vitamins & Supplements 

00:06:25
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD And then fish oils which appear to be very important for a number of different reasons not the least of which is that fish oils appear to help decrease inflammation again important with regards to that stress management techniques that we were talking about earlier including decreasing inflammation. Fish oils also help prevent heart disease. They may even enhance mood, and lower triglyceride levels which are often tied to an increase instance of cardio vascular disease. 

00:06:50
Chapter 17 Massage 

00:06:50
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Close your eyes and gently say the word massage… feels pretty good when you do that. Now imagine actually getting one. Now as medical director of our integrative medicine centre I have to get a massage on a regular basis you know for quality assurance. 

00:07:05
Chapter 18 Renewal Time 

00:07:05
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD So what I'm asking for you to do is to create some space in your weeks where you actually can rest. Now easier said than done I understand that but really when you think about it in many traditions around the world and in many religions there is the idea of the Sabbat, the day of rest. A 24 hour period of time where we will do no work. 

00:07:25
Chapter 19 Counseling, Hypnosis & Guided Imagery 

00:07:30
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Even just the way that we perhaps change or shift a pattern in our thinking about what's causing stress in our lives can actually lessen that stress day to day. And so the counselor can teach us how to do that. There are also other tools like clinical hypnosis and guided imagery and no we're not talking about oh you will become a kangaroo. 

00:07:50
Chapter 20 Summing Up 

00:07:50
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD My hope is that by hearing this from a physician you understand that there are physical ramifications. Physical problems that are tied to stress and that this might offer you additional freedom to say you know this is something I need to act on and thus be optimally well. 

00:08:05
Chapter 21 Yoga Exercise with Brooks Holland 

00:08:10
BROOKS HOLLAND Walk your knees back a few inches, tuck your toes under and exhale back to downward facing dog pose. Spread your fingers fully into the floor and feel the pose of the breath inhale, filling up the ribcage, the diaphragm, the exhale softening the heart towards the floor as the shoulder blade stay lifted on to the back.

00:09:20
DR. JOE PARISI Gently and easily let it go.

Introduction Dr. Russell Greenfield 

00:09:35
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Hi I am Dr. Russell Greenfield. I am a conventionally trained physician, an RD(ph) real Doc. I attended medical school in Chicago, trained in emergency medicine on the west coast. First came to Charlotte, North Carolina and began working in the emergency department right here at Carolina's Medical Center and was a faculty. But it doesn’t take long in the emergency department to see some of the ills that are present in healthcare system. See people who have to wait a long time to get their appointments who ultimately when they are finally seen end up feeling unheard. My peers in healthcare are often feel unheard themselves because they have so little time with which they spend with their patients. Even when our health is well addressed from a physical perspective, we are often left with gaping wounds that are emotional and spiritual in nature. Add to that soaring healthcare premiums. 

00:10:15
70% of patients come to Primary Care Doctor with Stress-Related Illness 

00:10:20
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD And that up to 70% of patients come to the Primary Care Doctor with the illnesses that are in some way Stress-Related and it looks like the perfect storm of healthcare. Mostly everyone agrees there's gotta be a better way. 

00:10:30
Andrew Weil & Russell Greenfield 

00:10:30
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD I was extremely fortunate in 1997 when I was accepted in to the first class of the program in Integrative Medicine at the university of Arizona college of Medicine with Dr Andrew Weil. And I share my background with you not because you need to know what I've been doing in the past three years but because I want you to understand that I like I honor I use conventional medical practice where it’s appropriate. But at the same time I think anyone of us could speak to their being not only benefits to conventional medical care but they're also being limitations and that the exact same thing can be said for complimentary and alternative therapies. That’s where integrative medicine comes into play. Integrative medicine is healing oriented medicine that pays attention to an entirety of the person. Their mind, their body, their spirit and in addition their family, their environment, their community. The goal is to utilize the best of conventional and or complimentary therapies as well as to pay attention to the lifestyle and dietary interventions. It is also an emphasis on the healing relationship between healthcare practitioner and we as patients. We're talking abut the best mix to support a given individuals own innate capacity to be well. 

00:11:40
Chapter 2 What Stress Does to Us 

00:11:40
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Stress why even talk about it. I mean its ubiquitous. Everybody has stress in their lives you just gotta buckle up and handle it right. Well you know I used to think that way. I’m an emergency physician by training I used to live on this stuff. Give me more I can handle it. But I was kidding myself. The research data is very, very clear. Stress when its chronic and unrelenting and when we don’t manage it effectively can undermine our health and well being. The stress can be defined as change. Anything that is perceived as a threat to our normal balance in life is a stress. And there can be internal stressors and external stressors. Internal stressors like holding ourselves to too high expectations. External stressors like job stresses or even things going on within the family. Now acute stresses can actually be pretty good for us like if we have a project that is due and needs to be done right away we can actually bring our level of performance up a notch. This comes from our primitive days perhaps when we had the flight or fight response built into our beings and this was like if the saber-toothed tiger suddenly showed up a dinner we could take off and start running we got a lot more energy. The problem is today if something is chasing us may be not saber-toothed tiger but a sense that we’ve got something that needs to be done or this other thing is coming up that needs to happen we have all this work to do we still have that sense that something is chasing us and when its that chronic unrelenting stress then those behaviors that were initially beneficial for us can actually become damaging over the long term. So I can point out at least five different things that chronic unrelenting stress does to our health and in a bad way. Stress lessens the restorative nature of sleep. It may even impact our ability to go to sleep. 

00:13:25
1) Stress impacts sleep 

00:13:25
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD And this is very, very important for our overall health and well being. 

00:13:30
2) Stress impacts immune system 

00:13:30
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Stress lessens the effectiveness of the immune system. Now it doesn't cause illness or cause cancer or anything of that nature but it can open up the doorway such that illness can establish itself and we all know this. When we're not getting enough sleep or under the gun, we're much more likely to get that cold or flu that’s going around. Then if we’re getting more rest. 

00:13:45
3) Stress causes weight gain 

00:13:45
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Stress by itself causes weight gain or at least sets up the environment for people to gain weight. Because when we're not getting enough sleep research study shows that that actually increases the instance of weight gain. In addition stress causes an increase in our hormone called cortisol and cortisol by itself causes an increase in fat deposition around the centre portion of the body. In addition when we eat and we're under stress we don’t metabolize food stuffs as efficiently and so fat cells called triglycerides stay around in the blood stream for a longer period of time. 

00:14:20
4) Stress negatively affects mood 

00:14:20
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Stress can impact our moods in a significant manner. It can make us more anxious, more irritable may be even depressed. And lastly stress increase inflammation in the body. 

00:14:30
5) Stress increases inflammation 

00:14:30
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Now certainly this is important for inflammatory disorders like arthritis. But did you know that at its fundamental basis, cardio vascular disease is an inflammatory disorder. Such that we can actually have an impact to lessen the instance of heart attack and stroke simply by finding appropriate ways to manage our stress. Now chronic unrelenting stress has also been shown to lessen the speed with which wounds heal, to lessen our interest in sexual activity, to increase pain in our body. So there is ample reason to go forth and say you know what managing stress is no longer optional. 

00:15:10
3) Overview How Stress Manifests 

00:15:10
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD So we've talked about some of the different things that stress can do to our bodies now how might stress actually manifests so we could recognize if indeed its having an impact on us. Well in adults a lot of different things can show up. First of all if we have certain illnesses like arthritis or certain maladies like acne, symptoms can get a lot worse. You can end up with worse digestive symptoms that we have irritable bowel syndrome. We can end up with worse pain if we have some painful conditions. So pay attention to that and take a look and see what's going on in the context of your life. All of a sudden if you find that you have more tension in your neck or shoulders if you're wearing your shoulders where your earrings normally should be. 

00:15:50
Signs of Stress: - Conditions Worsening- Joint Pain Acne Digestive Problems Neck & Shoulder Tension Lower Back Pain Fatigue Irritability 

00:15:50
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD If you develop lower back pain without ever having anything that might have incited that pain, if you're suddenly a little bit more tired, little more fatigued than usual and that stays in that way for a long period of time. If you notice that you just not as interested in some of your typical activities. All these different kinds of things can be signs that stress is ongoing in your life and having an impact that needs to be addressed. Now in children some of the same symptoms can show up. They might not be sleeping quite as well. They might be a little bit more listless. 

00:16:15
Signs of Stress in Kids: Mild Headaches Abdominal Discomfort Frequent Colds 

00:16:15
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD But the symptoms that we really pay attention to for children is if all of a sudden they start developing lets say mild headaches or abdominal discomforts or even if they're getting a little bit more cold and flu than they usually would be. Chronic unrelenting stress can lessen effectiveness of the immune system so the kids can be more open to getting that cold or flu that's going around. When you find these symptoms in your child, be open to creating that space that is without fear, without judgment, so the child can come to you and speak about the stresses ongoing in their lives. With yourself take a look in the mirror and give yourself permission to say Gosh am I under this kind of stress that might be actually causing these symptoms. Now certainly as symptoms are ongoing for a long time or getting worse, you need to talk to your doctor, a healthcare practitioner. But otherwise create this open space that you can take a look and see now what might we do for our kids? What might we do for ourselves that might help lessen the stress in our lives and help us to be healthier? 

00:17:10
4) Overview Stress in Our Children 

00:17:15
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD So now we've recognized that our children can experience stress and in fact that our own kids are feeling stressed. So first and foremost take a look and see how we're taking care of ourselves? How we're acting once we get home from work or from wherever we've been during the course of the day. Are we venting what's happened during the course of the day? Are we walking around blue or irritable? Are we not doing anything visible to the children that shows them that you know what I'm under stress and I'm gonna take some time to take care of myself. The role modeling is critically important. So our kids learn not only do they know that stress is part of life but they also know that’s important to manage it. Now there is a lot of different things we can do to help our kids. First make sure that their life is not too structured. That they are not over scheduled, that after school they don’t have ballet, then horse back riding, then baseball practice, then they gotta go to piano lessons on and on and on. Kids need some free time just to be kids. Not too much TV time, not too much time in front of the computer, the Game Boy because those kinds of games can actually increase stress in our kids even though they like them so much. So limit screen time. But laugh with them in watching comedies, playing games, exercise, getting adequate sleep, even using human touch. The touch of a parent at night time to help a child relax getting ready for sleep. Through gentle parental massage. There are many other tools that can be used here. Eating in a healthy manner and creating rituals around meal time that brings family together to touch base how are you doing? What was your great thing today? What can we give gratitude for about what happened during the course of our day? So many different tools that we can use. The key is to recognize that our children do indeed experience stress and then it all starts with us as to how they learn to manage that stress. 

00:19:00
5) Overview Managing Our Stress 

00:19:00
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Any practice of stress reduction starts with kindness and what I mean is kindness towards ourselves. We have to remember that stress is ubiquitous. Everybody has stress in their lives. And yet it is the rare individual who possesses adequate means to manage that stress. So give yourself permission to try new things, to explore new modalities that might help to manage the stress in your lives and thereby stay healthier. So we're gonna talk about some of those different techniques might be and we're gonna divide them into three different categories. Pocket tools, Top Drawer tools and Power tools. 

00:19:30
Pocket Tools: Techniques you can take with you anywhere 

00:19:35
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Now pocket Tools are things that you can take with you anywhere you go anytime day or night. Things like laughter, spiritual practices, getting together with friends that you love and care about, exercise, breath work, progressive muscle relaxation. 

00:19:50
Top Drawer Tools: Disciplines you first learn and practice in a class before continuing on your own 

00:19:50
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Top Drawer tools are things like yoga, Tai Chi, Meditation. Things that perhaps you go to a class every once in a while and then use on your own as need be. And then Power tools. These are the kinds of techniques where we might need to go an instructor or somebody to work with us to help manage our stress. 

00:20:05
Power Tools Techniques that involve working with a health care practitioner 

00:20:05
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Things like massage therapy, counseling, guided imagery in clinical hypnosis and Chinese medicine. Any one of these techniques might be a benefit for us. Remember the only way to find out is to give ourselves permission to try something new. So I am implore you be kind to yourself. Go out and find out what else might be available for you to help manage your stress. 

00:20:25
6) Pocket Tool I: Breathing 

00:20:30
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD One of the most effective means of managing stress acutely is to use breath work. Breath work is often barred from a yogic technique called Pranayama. My mentor Dr. Andrew Weil taught me a yoga breathing technique out at the university of Arizona that I'd like to share with you and I love teaching this to people because it means I get to do it. This is called the 4-7-8 breath. This is a quiet inhalation through the nose to a count of four, holding the breath to a count of seven and exhaling a little bit noisily to the count of eight. The entire time that we're doing this replacing the tip of our tongue behind our upper teethes right where the teeth and gums meet like this. You don’t have to press hard just let it relax there. This is your yogic position of the tongue and it sets up a circulation of relaxation throughout the mind that then spreads throughout the rest of the body. 4-7-8 is one cycle of the breathing pattern. When you practice it you do it four times. I'm gonna show you how to do it twice. And you'll see that the way I'm breathing is not very rushed not very hurried it is gentle and easy and that what's this technique should be gentle and easy. When you do four cycles of the 4-7-8 breath, for the next 90 seconds or so everything else goes away because all you'll be doing is breathing and counting numbers. Does it take all the stress away? No it really doesn’t. But it really lessens the level of that stress and you really can feel remarkably better. So let me show you what this looks like. I usually start by taking a big deep breath in a big deep breath out and then starting the breathing exercise. Now you can go as quickly or slowly as you like because I don’t want you to strain you to hold your breath. Use the cadence that works well for you as long as you keep the same 4-7-8 cadence throughout your practice. So I ask you sit comfortably with your feet on the ground flat or lie down don’t do this standing up because you can get a little bit dizzy. You can do this eyes opened or eyes closed as you see fit. So it looks something like this. I'm gonna start with a big deep breath in, big exhale out and then start the practice. 

00:22:30
[sil.] 

00:22:30
Inhale for a count of four 

00:22:40
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Inhale 

00:22:40
Hold for count of seven 

00:22:45
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Hold 

00:22:45
Exhale for a count of eight 

00:22:50
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Out. Inhale… Hold… out. Just like that now that’s two cycles I asked you to do four cycles and again remember I've counted somewhat slowly you count as quickly as you need to just keep that same cadence of 4-7-8. It is very effective and I will share with you when I first learnt this I was puzzled. I thought how could something I've been doing all my life breathing really be used to manage stress? It is very effective. It’s a great pocket tool you can take with you anywhere that you go and it can even help you get to sleep at night. A great stress buster practice the breathing technique because it can be very beneficial for you. 

00:23:55
7) Top Drawer Tool I: Meditation 

00:24:00
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Meditation is another fascinating technique for managing stress and its another one of our top drawer tools for doing so. Now meditation has been practiced across the ages by various cultures and across various religious traditions. And there is no single one way which is the right way to do meditation. Chose the way that’s right for you and so you need to explore and see what might work for you. You'll hear about meditation techniques where you are given a mantra or a word that you repeat over and over again when you're meditating. You'll hear about other techniques where you self-direct yourself towards focus concentration on whatever thought might come in to your head. And what's nice you don’t necessarily have to sit still to meditate. You can meditate while walking, you can mediate while eating, you can meditate while gardening. Anyone of these techniques can work. And there is a lot of different ways to learn how to meditate of course. You can attend classes. Read books, and I would tell you from my own experience I was a little skeptical when I first learned meditation. I thought I like baseball, basketball and football there was no way I'm gonna want to do this and yet I found as I learnt it over a little bit of time, over weeks, I found that I was much more relaxed. And I found that I could use my meditation not only to treat stressful events when I experience them but actually help prevent stress from developing. And indeed that’s what the research shows. But beyond that, research data show very interestingly that meditation when done on a consistent basis can lessen back pain can lessen headaches, can relieve anxiety, can deepen and enhance the restorative nature of sleep. And even when meditation was done for children and with children, kids seemed to act out less and even do a little bit better in school. I highly recommend that you explore meditation as an effective stress management technique. 

00:25:40
8) Top Drawer Tool II: Meditation Exercise with Dr. Joe Parisi 

00:25:45
DR. JOE PARISI Its possible to relax in a fairly short period of time if we bring our awareness back to the present moment by focusing on our breathing. Let me teach you a way to do that. That you can use with just three short breaths and in doing so relax your body and your mind. To begin take in a deep breath and as you exhale making sure that you’re exhaling very slowly. If you bring your awareness to your tongue and relax your tongue. Taking in another deep breath and again a very slow exhalation this time bringing your awareness to your jaw allowing your jaw to drop for your lips to part as much as they might wish and for that part your body to relax. And finally taking in a deep breath slowly exhaling this time allowing your shoulders to drop and to relax as you're exhaling imagining if you wish that the tension in your body is flowing down all the way out through your toes. Saying in your mind relax body, alert mind. And when we bring our awareness to our breathing this way, relaxing the body we help ourselves feel calmer and the challenge is to remember to do it throughout the day. So let me suggest that the next time you're sitting in a red light that in the middle of the light perhaps you’ll see the word relax… 

00:27:35
RELAX 

00:27:40
DR. JOE PARISI …that'll be a perfect time to then take in three breaths relaxing the tongue, the jaw and your shoulders using the red light as an opportunity to pause and relax. 

00:27:55
9) Pocket Tool II: Exercise 

00:28:00
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Mostly everybody knows that exercise can be beneficial for our hearts for our digestive tract our lungs for our muscles. But did you know that exercise is probably the premier the best stress buster that there is its true. And there is very good research in this regard. People who participate in exercise on a regular basis even if they don’t increase their fitness level per se, actually have less stress, less sense of anxiety and seem to do better health wise. Now the idea here is to at least participate in a program of exercise on a regular basis. You'll hear the experts speak saying that people should be exercising for 30 to 45 minutes a day on most days of the week. And for some of us that’s a challenge because of such a busy, hectic lifestyle these days. But what's important is you don’t have to get all of your exercise done at once. So you can split up that 30 45 minutes into little bits throughout the course of the day and still get your benefits. So you might do 10-15 minutes of exercise in the morning. A little bit during your lunch hour and then finishing up at night. So what are the kinds of different exercises that we might participate in? One of the easiest ones to do is to walk. Walking is a wonderful exercise and again something that you can do and split up during the course of the day. Something you can also do with a friend or family members. So a little bit of walking in the morning perhaps a little during lunch hour and a little bit in the evening with your family or friends. A great way to get your exercise regiment kicked up to a good start. You might actually partner with a friend who is already engaged in the exercise program. This way you've got a little bit of accountability because your friend is expecting you to be there and you have the added fun of working out with somebody. It's not quite so lonely. And other way to do this if you can afford it, is to work with a fitness trainer. I'm not saying you have to work with a trainer for months on end but a great way to kick start your exercise program is to sign on with a fitness trainer for perhaps four to six weeks. Working out with a trainer may be twice a week because to be honest with you when you plunk money down and make an appointment to meet with somebody for exercise you usually show up. By the end of that 4-6 weeks, you've got an individualized exercise program and a time slot set aside for exercise. You can stop the trainer but continue your exercise program. And exercise might involve aerobic exercise. It might involve lightweights or heavyweights but that’s why working with the trainer is so good because they can meet our needs with respect to our goals and our limitations. I highly recommend that you engage in regular exercise for overall health and well being but also for stress management there is almost nothing better than exercise.

10) Pocket Tools III: Progressive Muscle Relaxation & Laughter 

00:30:35
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Lets talk about two other pocket tools that can be very beneficial with regards to stress management. Progressive muscle relaxation and Laughter Therapy. Progressive muscle relaxation or PMR is a means of tensing and relaxing different muscle groups throughout the body in order to enhance stress reduction. Now we might start off down at the feet by first of all for five to seven seconds scrunching our toes down into the ground real hard and then relaxing taking a big deep breath in big deep breath out. Take a moment just to relax and now lifting the toes up towards the heavens for five to seven seconds hard, hard, hard and then relaxing again. Big deep breath in big deep breath out taking a moment just to quiet. Next thing we might do is lift our feet up towards the sky leaving our heels down on the ground, five to seven seconds and then relaxing. Big deep breath in big deep breath out. Now lifting the heels up off the ground for five to seven seconds stopping big deep breath in big deep breath out and (inaudible ) the body. Now if you have high blood pressure or some form of cardio vascular disease, I don't recommend that you hold your breath while doing this. For others who don’t have those kinds of maladies often times we do hold out breath while doing the tensing with the muscles. And then let out the breath take a big deep breath in big deep breath out before going on to the next muscle group. Going to the calves, our thighs, our buttock region actually lifting ourselves up off the chair for five to seven seconds then relaxing. Tightening our abdominal musculature, tightening the biceps muscles, the triceps muscles, tightening up our shoulders, even tightening up our neck and even ultimately tightening up our face scrunching it up like this. Don’t do this in a lot of company though. Then ultimately going ahead and tightening up all the muscles all at once. Something like this. For five to seven seconds let your breath out big deep breath in big deep breath out and relax a little bit. You know in some forms of body work there's the theory that traumas, tensions, anxieties are not only held up here in our mind but actually held in the muscles as well. And so doing this kind of practice stretching, tensing, releasing that tension in the muscles can release some of the stress that builds up on our body and help manage that tension and anxiety in our lives. Now another great tool in this regard is laughter therapy. You know it’s really hard to be bombed(ph) out depressed when you're laughing. So watch comedies, take out your favorite funny movie and enjoy it. Hang out with people who make you laugh. Laughter therapy works and in fact there is even research data suggesting… 

00:33:05
Laughter increases cells that improve immune function vs. Stress increases inflammation 

00:33:10
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD …that laughter by itself can increase cells in our body that improve immune system function while lessening the number of cells in our body that increase inflammation. There again the interaction between mind and body stress, increasing inflammatory cells, laughter therapy, decreasing inflammatory cells. These are great tools that are very effective and also fun again a big recommendation for either Progressive Muscle Relaxation or Laughter Therapy or both. Something you take with you in your pocket and can use anytime that you need to. 

00:33:40
11) Pocket Tool IV: Spirituality 

00:33:45
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD There has been great debate in some circles about the role of spirituality in health. Mind spiritual practice actually translate into better health and well being. I believe so. Interestingly enough the first physicians were not only physical healers they were also spiritual leaders. And understand age of high tech medicine and focus on science there's been a little bit less attention paid to the spiritual aspect of health and well being. But that is changing. There's been a great deal of work done in recent years looking at the potential of how spirituality might help us. And there is some very interesting data here. But first how do we even define spirituality. Well some people define spirituality by their religious practice. Prayer, study, engaging in services with others and indeed research shows that that might be beneficial. But for others a spiritual practice is engaging in activities like walking in nature, gazing at the stars, listening to music, practicing yoga. Really a spiritual practice is anything that puts us in contact with something greater than ourselves. It puts us in touch with possibility with our own personal meaning of our lives. And again the research shows very interesting data. People who participate in a regular religious practice for example have a lesser instance of recurrent cardio vascular disease and stroke, can actually lower blood pressure to some degree. So even though we don’t necessarily know how spirituality works, this is one of those instances where perhaps the mechanism of action isn’t quite so important as is the regular engagement in such a practice to help us be well. 

00:35:25
12) Top Drawer Tools III: Yoga & Tai Chi 

00:35:25
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Yoga is one of my favorite techniques for stress management. But before talking about how yoga can be used to manage stress effectively, lets dispel some common misperceptions about that practice. Yoga in and of itself is not a religious practice while it can be used as such. Most people use it as a way to deepen their own spiritual practice or just their won relaxation. It doesn’t have to be a religious practice. In addition many people think you have to be flexible in order to practice yoga and that’s not true. People of all different fitness levels can practice yoga from the person who runs marathons to the person who is in a wheelchair. It can be individualized to our own needs and it is a wonderful and effective means of managing stress. Now the postures done in yoga are done in preparation for breath work. The breath work done in preparation for what might be termed meditation and the meditation done in preparation for the real work of yoga which is spiritual reflection, a chance to be with oneself and quiet, or to be in contact with others in a class. It is a beautiful practice. I recommend that especially when starting at to use some of the more gentle forms of yoga or explore them Hatha or Kripalu or Anusara. Some of the more restorative and relaxing forms rather than some of the more vigorous forms of yoga that are out there. And often times it behooves us to work one on one with an instructor first so we can find out what our goals are and what our limitations might be. So when we join the class, we can be more comfortable. And remember only here in America, is yoga a competitive sport. So if the person over here to our left can touch the floor while we're just touching our knees, its really okay. Its where we're supposed to be and we need to find comfort in that spot. Another option that's a top Drawer tool for managing stress is Tai Chi. Tai Chi is been called moving meditation and is practiced in community all across Asian countries early in the morning and even late at night. It is another beautiful practice of flowing movements tied to breath and to meditation. It is been used to help prevent falls and to lessen hip fractures and has also been shown to lower blood pressure and again effectively manage stress. You can find Tai Chi classes many places in your locale and if not there are many tapes available as well. Yoga, Tai Chi very effective Top Drawer tools for managing stress please experience them, explore them 'coz you really might find benefit and another tool to help manage stress effectively. 

00:37:45
13) Power Tool I: Traditional Chinese Medicine 

00:37:50
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD The practice of Chinese medicine is a fascinating topic. Chinese medicine is a complete system of healthcare on to itself. And it is intimately involved with balance and we (inaudible ) from Chinese medicine, integrative medicines because we define health as balance, but balance of what? In Chinese medicine its the balance of Chi or the life force both within us and without us. And Chinese medicine practitioners would say that when people are under stress it manifests in an imbalance in that Chi in a person. It might be an excess of Chi in one area or a deficiency or blockage of Chi in another area. And Chinese medicine practitioners pick up on this through their evaluation of us and how do they do that? Well interestingly enough they check our pulses at our wrist. At three different places and at two different depths on the right side similarly three different places and two different depths on the left side and each pulse assigned to a different organ in the body. They will often ask us to stick out our tongue and they will read our tongue to get an idea what might be happening with the Chi within the body. And then offer us a treatment. And they have many treatments available to them. They might use Chinese medicinal herbs, Chinese medicinal massage called tui na. It might offer changes in our diet but they also often offer acupuncture or acupressure. And this is manipulation of Chi through very specified points on the body. Because it is believed that Chi runs through channels of energy all along the body and that by manipulating specific points we can manipulate the Chi and relieve certain symptoms. Now Chinese medicine is typically used as a compliment to good conventional western medical care here in the US and other industrialized nations. But more and more physicians are learning acupuncture now and this is really a sea change considering that 20 or 30 years ago acupuncture was almost unheard of on our soil. There's very, very good research data here with regards to acupuncture and Chinese medicine helping with sleep disorders with anxiety, depression and pain. So I encourage you to take a look and see how this kind of care could help you. Remember the only to find out is to give yourself the freedom to explore something new and see if indeed it might offer you benefits. 

00:40:05
14) Pocket Tool V: Nutrition 

00:40:05
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD So we've already talked about how stress can increase inflammation in the body but did you know that you an actually lessen that inflammation simply through diet and indeed you can actually use the diet to lessen stress. Not just by reaching for comfort food of course, but actually by the ritual of coming together to make a meal. To decide what you're going to eat. To choose the kinds of foods that you'll use for the dinner tonight, and then to come together and eat a meal together. The ritual can be very, very relaxing and bring family together and lessen stress. But beyond that there are foods that we can choose specifically to help lessen stress and lessen inflammation in the body. Very interesting and you don’t have to become very strict about your diet. You don’t have to adhere to a very regimented diet and in fact I don’t recommend that because a really strict regimented diet becomes a diet of disallowance. And that’s not what we are looking for. We're looking for a diet of health promotion. So its okay to splurge every once in a while on the food that you know may not be good for you overall 'coz sometimes even that kind of meal is good for the soul and that can be just as important. Food is about love. Its about experience, its about family, its about all these kinds of joys and its about our health and well-being. So use a well balanced diet and splurge every once in a while so that you can truly enjoy what food can be. Now there are certain foods that we want to enjoy on a more regular basis and foods we're gonna eat on a more limited basis. But there is no food that we cant eat at all. So enjoy but everything in moderation. So what are some of the general guidelines with regards to nutrition and diet that we can follow, that will help us to be well, to lessen stress and lessen inflammation. We'd like to limit the intake of saturated fat to some degree. So it doesn’t mean that you have to be a vegetarian. But we'd like you to cut back on red meat and dairy products to some degree. And instead enjoy some of the other options like fresh fish, lots and lots of the varied colors of fruit and vegetables, try beans, explore the taste of soy. All different kinds of tasteries(ph) that should contribute to that joy of eating and lessen stress. Wanna enjoy some different tasting foods like curry dishes because each of these different foods provide different nutrients, a different vitamin profile that can be power packed that really help us to be well. Watch out for your intake of trans fat and that has become a lot easier to do because of the labeling now. You can actually take a look at the labels and see how much trans fat is on a given product. We wanna lessen the intake of trans fat and partially hydrogenated oils because they actually increase inflammation in the body. Use oils like monounsaturated oils like extra virgin olive oil or expeller pressed canola oil. Monounsaturated oils actually improve health especially heart health and again can be used to help decrease inflammation. And don’t forget its very important to prepare your foods in a healthy way. If you're going to grill watch out for charring your foods and cut away the charred part of that because that might be bad for you and indeed we wanna lessen our intake of fried foods, and perhaps choose different cooking methods like steaming which can keep some of those vital nutrients in the food much longer and be very beneficial for us. So again choosing the foods and the way we prepare them not only is a great way to manage our stress but keeps us healthy over the long haul as well. 

00:43:25
15) Steam Cooking with Chef Phil Anderson 

00:43:30
CHEF PHIL ANDERSON Steaming keeps the nutrients and minerals in the food. The typical steamer has ah… two bases and a top. Ah… You can use white wine, you can use ah… boleyn(ph), chicken stock you can use all kinds of different ah… creative ah… juices. Ah… Today, what I did was, I steamed out some carrots and some asparagus and broccoli. And I have some of that in there. The essence in there. Okay, so we're gonna make a marinate. And we're gonna begin with ginger. Now, what I'm gonna also do is throw some ginger into this this, this stock that I have. Ginger is very strong, very cultant(ph). So we just don’t need a whole lot of it. So I'm gonna throw that in there. You've cut now the ginger we're gonna add the clove of garlic. We smash it and if it is smashed it has a different flavor. And if you chop it or dice it has a different flavor. More intense. So we're gonna mince it. So on one side of my knife, I'm gonna add it to my marinate and the other side of my knife I'm gonna add it to my stock. Here we go. When the cookbook authors ask you to zest an orange or a lemon or a lime or something citrus, what they mean is the very other portion of the skin. You see the other portion of the skin is really sweet and the bitter part is right underneath that sweet part. So it's really… You have to be really careful to not get that bitter piece when you're taking the skin out. I prefer doing it with my knife. So, I have some zest, you know in a bowl back here and that’s from an orange. So, I'm gonna add that in there. This is an orange. Some white lime. This is a quarter cup. And you don’t have to segment it. Ah… But it looks nicer when you do. So… And remember the bitter stuff you… you don’t want that on there. And what they mean by segmenting, is you see the veins in there? So you're just taking your knife and going on other side of the vein. Now I have an orange that's been segmented. That's right here. Okay, so now we have green onions that we need to add. The green onion is just for really color although it doesn't part the, the nice onion flavor. You see, I haven’t added any fat to this recipe. It's a marinate. Now you can when you reduce it later in the recipe you add butter but put a glass to it, but you won't need to. It's not required. It's optional. And take our wild Alaskan salmon. Isn’t it beautiful? And take this skin out off a bit. You just pull the skin, pull on the knife and you don’t have any salmon on that skin. And we'll cut this into flays. That’s a nice lunch size flay. Okay, so now after we've flayed our salmon, we're going to put it into the marinate into this wonderful marinate that we've made. Now we only need two of these flays according to the recipe. So, we're… We're gonna kind of swish it around and then we're gonna take a zip-lock bag. This one of my favorite tools. It fits almost anywhere in your refrigerator. I'm gonna just slide this fish and marinate into the bag. Okay. So now what we wanna do is we want to marinate this salmon for an hour, two hours in the refrigerator. Okay, all right. So we've marinated our salmon for several hours. Take it out of the fridge, pour it right back into this bowl so I can see what we've got. Right. We're gonna steam this now, these pieces of salmon. Take our steamer, turn it on and we're gonna take some napa cabbage in the steamer and line it. And this is to prevent the salmon from sticking. Isn't that pretty? Yeah. Yeah, it's nice. All right, so now you wanna make sure that the steam basket top is snug. Okay, so the convection, the steam actually is a natural convection and what its doing is its forcing a lot of heat into the salmon, and its steaming away and we're gonna take a sauce pan, and we're gonna throw our marinate that we had in that sauce pan, and we wanna reduce this down to about half. Well we have a 100%, we're gonna reduce it down to 50%. And what that does is that the natural caramelization and the sugars thicken it all up. So you have more of a glaze. We've got both things going now. If you could run up and take a quick shower, come back down, your dinner is ready. But if you just wanna wait, it's just 8 to 10 minutes. The salmon is an oily fish. So you gonna have, the omega-3 is from the salmon. And you have the spiciness of the ginger and the garlic. It's very tasty. Let's check and see. Yes that’s beautiful! Okay, we're gonna plate this. Nonstick, beautiful! Move the cabbage out of the way. Oh! You know most of the time your salmon is not gonna fall apart. And this ones beginning to crack. And sauce is really thick. And we're just gonna pour a little bit over the top of that. Isn’t that beautiful? And then maybe a little bit of garnish. There we go. A steaming protex food. So you have a much more delicate texture. You retain way more nutrients and minerals than you do in other forms of cooking. So when you're feeling depleted, you can replenish and nourish yourself. Steaming is a stress-free way of cooking. 

00:51:20
16) Pocket Tool VI: Vitamins & Supplements 

00:51:20
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD From a vitamin supplement and herbal perspective there are some agents that are promoted as being beneficial for stress management. 

00:51:25
For Relaxation: Chamomile Tea Passionflower 

00:51:25
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD You might hear about things like Chamomile Tea or Passionflower, which can be very-very relaxing. But you gotto be a little careful, 'cos that can also make you sleepy. So don't take them before going on a long drive or using any kind of heavy machinery. You might also hear about some of the tonics that are out there. 

00:51:40
For Relaxation: Ginseng Rhodiola Cordiceps 

00:51:40
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Like Ginseng or Rhodiola. You might hear about the mushroom tonic Cordiceps. The tonics help to normalize function in a person who perhaps is so much depleted, because of all the stress that they've been under. These an be very beneficial, especially over a relatively short period of time, over a few months of use. But remember what is natural is not always synonymous with what is safe. And so it's important to discuss these agents with your doctor and healthcare practitioners before you embark in a program like this. Now even beyond using some of the various supplements and herbs that might be beneficial for stress management, comes a discussion about the best use of vitamins and supplements for overall health promotion, 'cos again that can really help us to manage our stress and be well. So, in general we talk about the use of specific agents, little bit different for men than for women. For women we recommend using a good multi-vitamin, a calcium supplement and a fish oil supplement. 

00:52:35
Daily Vitamin for Women: B Complex Antioxidants Vitamin D Zinc Copper 

00:52:35
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Now a good multi-vitamin is going to have B Complex in it which will help the stress management. Some of the antioxidants are important. Perhaps a little bit of Vitamin D, Zinc and Copper, those types of things. And it’s a good hedge against perhaps not getting all the nutrients we might need from our diet. 

00:52:50
Calcium Supplements Help Prevent: Osteoporosis Colon Polyps Colon Cancer (with Magnesium) 

00:52:50
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD A calcium supplement will help not only prevent osteoporosis but hopefully help prevent colon polyps maybe colon cancer as well. We usually recommend taking calcium with magnesium. Calcium constipates, magnesium gives you the runs, you put them together, you're usually okay. And usually the calcium supplements will come with Vitamin D as well. 

00:53:10
Fish Oils help: Decrease inflammation 

00:53:10
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD And then fish oils, which appear to be very important for a number of different reasons. Not the least of which is that fish oils appear to help decrease inflammation. Again important with regards to that stress management techniques that we were talking about earlier including decreasing inflammation. 

00:53:25
Fish Oils help: Decrease inflammation Prevent heart disease Enhance mood Lower triglyceride levels 

00:53:25
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Fish oils also help prevent heart disease. They may even enhance mood and lower triglyceride levels, which are often tied to an increase instance of cardiovascular disease. Now for men the recommendations are a little bit different. There are some concerns that taking in too much calcium can actually increase the instance of a prostate problems in men. So unless a man truly has osteoporosis or has a real low level of calcium, we don’t recommend taking calcium supplements, rather that they get calcium in adequate amounts from their diet. Still however we recommend that men take an adequate amount of Vitamin D, because of its anti-cancer benefits and other health benefits. 

00:54:00
For men: Calcium can increase possibility of prostate problems Vitamin D 800 - 1000 I.U. for everyone 

00:54:00
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD 800 to a 1,000 international units of Vitamin D a day looks like a good amount for everybody. One other thing to keep in mind with regards to multi-vitamin, it's very easy to get too much Vitamin A from a multi-vitamin. Straight Vitamin A in amounts more than perhaps 4,000 international units a day might actually be harmful for us rather than beneficial to us. 

00:54:20
Too much Vitamin A not good (more than 4000 I.U.) 

00:54:20
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD And it's easy to get enough Vitamin A in the diet. So look for a multi-vitamin that doesn’t have a lot of straight Vitamin A in it. 

00:54:25
Carotenes are ok Mixed carotenes are good 

00:54:25
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Now if the Vitamin A comes in the form of carotenes that usually is okay. Mixed carotenes can be very good for us. With one caveat, if you smoke or if you have smoked for a long period of time in the past, it's best to avoid multi-vitamins that have high concentrations of beta-carotene. 

00:54:40
Beta-Carotene (20,000 I.U.) harmful for smokers 

00:54:40
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Perhaps anything along the lines of 20,000 international units and up. There are some concerns that beta-carotene in people who smoke or who have smoked may actually again be harmful rather than beneficial for us. So ask your healthcare provider about the best kinds of supplements that you can use. Because it can get confusing and again as long as you have that healing relationship with your healthcare provider, that’s an integrative medicine practitioner and they can help you to be well over the long haul. 

00:55:10
17) Power Tool II: Massage 

00:55:10
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD I'd like to ask your indulgence for a moment. Close your eyes and gently say the word massage. Feels pretty good when you do that. Now imagine actually getting one. Now as Medical Director of our integrative medicine centre I have to get a massage on a regular basis, you know for quality assurance. But I must tell you that prior to doing so I used to think that massage therapy was an indulgence, something that you treated yourself to every once in a while. And indeed it's not. Since the days of hypocrites, massage therapy has been a very useful adjunct to any kind of medical care. But it’s a very, very effective means of managing stress. We have very good research data with regards to massage therapy for adults first of all. Lowering blood pressure, relieving anxiety and muscle tension, but again as a great stress buster. And for children, especially when parents provide the massage, massage therapy can also be very effective and lessening stress and anxiety. Now, you gotta go to the right massage therapist. Somebody who not only asks for feedback but is willing to accept that kind of feedback. You also wanna go to somebody who is well trained, who has different tools and might do deep massage in one area and very gentle massage in another. Because remember we're not completely balanced in this regard. So you wanna go to somebody who really fits your needs. Now massage therapy should be done on a relatively consistent basis in order to get the benefits. If you get a massage today, you're gonna feel really good. But by the week you may forget that you ever had a massage earlier on. So you wanna do it on a consistent basis and what does that mean? If you can afford it perhaps once a month or once every three weeks would be terrific. Because the benefits of massage therapy accrue over time. So the more often you do it the better it is. Now it's really easy to cancel a massage and I recommend that you don’t. Because this is part and parcel of an overall program of managing your stress. This is your time. And I must say there's another reason why I like massage therapy. When you commit to having the opportunity to come lay down on a massage therapy table your are actually committing to time for yourself. Time to receive human touch in a healing manner. And I believe that human touch heals. How good to know that something that feels so good to us is actually so good for us. 

00:57:25
18) Pocket Tool VII: Renewal Time 

00:57:30
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD I wanna introduce a concept that is at first a little puzzling, but shortly will make a lot of sense I believe. That being that there is a significant difference between rest and sleep. 

00:57:40
REST vs. SLEEP 

00:57:40
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Sleep happens when we're asleep. Rest happens when we're awake. And that’s why I wanna put forth the notion that we all need to create space in our weeks. Time to rest. Time to literally stop. You know in other countries around the world they actually think we have lost our minds. They often say that people in America get sick because we refuse to stop. And I think there is something to be said for that. And the way I define stopping is creating space where we will not do anything that we have primary responsibility for. So whether that’s work, whether that’s washing the dishes, doing the laundry. We need to create some time in our lives where we can actually rest. In Chinese medicine there is a perspective that people who give and give and give run the risk of becoming depleted. Now depletion by itself doesn’t cause illness, but it can lead to illness. And again that depleted state speaks very much to what happens to us when we don’t have our stress managed effectively. So what I'm asking for you to do is to create some space in your weeks where you actually can rest. Now easier said than done, I understand that. But really when you think about it in many traditions around the world and a many religions there is the idea of the Sabbat, the day of rest. A 24-hour period of time where we will do no work. Now for most of us that’s a lot to start with. So what I propose is create some space that’s a little bit easier. Take one weekday night perhaps three hours and one six-hour period of time on the weekend during which you guarantee yourself you will do no work. This is your time to rest. To rejuvenate, to renew, to do things that inspire you. And this is especially true for people who are caregivers. When somebody asks you if there is something that they can do for you, ask them if they can spell you to give you some time to rest. Now if your going to the bookstore or to the gym and you pass the market, you shouldn't say; "Well I can go do my shopping right now." That’s not what this time is for. This is the time for you to relax, to enjoy. And really it's quite amazing, when we're not quite so task oriented, it's remarkable how much more easily visible the beauty all around us is. And what better way could there possibly be to help manage our stress than to take more notice of that. 

00:59:55
19) Power Tools III: Counseling, Hypnosis & Guided Imagery 

01:00:00
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD One of the power tools that we often talk with patients about is counseling. Now, in years past a lot of people had a sense of it. Somebody went for counseling they had a mental imbalance or a weakness something of that nature. We are a way past that now. I honestly think that myself most people I know… 

01:00:20
Counseling is beneficial to all 

01:00:20
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD …most all of our patients could benefit from counseling in some way, share perform it some time in their life. Now counseling is not just if you're crazy or going through really severe stress even. It is something that helps us to learn ways that we might lessen stress even through our everyday running the middle lives. A counselor does something which is really quite unique. 

01:00:35
Counselor holds up mirror 

01:00:40
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD They don’t judge us. They actually kind of hold a mirror up for us to take a look and see what's going on. Often times we're too close to see exactly what's happening in our lives. It's very nice to work with somebody who can be an objective assessor or an objective partner and help us decide about how we might best handle the things that are going on in our lives. Now, counselors often have other tools in their pocket. 

01:01:00
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) help shift patterns in thinking 

01:01:00
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD They can use things like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT. This is something that is very, very effective. And all that it is, is talking about how to change the way we think about the things going on in our lives. Even just the way that we perhaps change or shift a pattern in our thinking about what's causing stress in our lives can actually lessen that stress day to day. And so the counselor can teach us how to do that. There are also other tools like clinical hypnosis and guided imagery. And no we're not talking about; "Oh, you will become a kangaroo." 

01:01:30
Clinical Hypnosis for relaxation and healing

DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD No, we're talking about means of actually relaxation and sending messages of healing to our bodies. You might not know, but clinical hypnosis, guided imagery have both been shown to be very effective with the number of physical maladies. They are very effective in the period before and after surgery, can help release tension in muscles, have been shown to relieve headache pain and lower back pain. All these different techniques using the mind to help the body. As it's has been said by many other people in the marriage of mind and body there is no divorce. So learning some of these different techniques can be very effective and very beneficial.

Guided Imagery uses imagination to relieve tension 

01:02:05
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD And guided imagery is a very nice tool, because it gives us the opportunity to use our imagination, to again send healing thoughts to our body, send healing thoughts that help relieve the tension, relieve the stress. Where we're thinking about places that might really be relaxing for us. That ocean front view, that mountain view, that one place we went to that gave us so much peace. Sometimes when we close our eyes and just do our best to kind of go to that place, it can really relieve the tension in our lives. Counselors are wonderful partners in teaching us how we might better our lives and manage our stress. 

01:02:40
Counselors are partners to relieve stress 

01:02:40
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD I highly recommend that you consider meeting with one if you find that the stress techniques that you're using thus far haven’t been as effective as you would like. There is a great deal you can learn from the partnership and they can help us to be stress free and healthy.

20) Summing Up 

01:03:00
DR. RUSSELL GREENFIELD Over our time together, we've had the opportunity to talk about stress. How we define stress? What it can do to us and how we might manage stress? We've talked about a number of different tools that might be helpful. We've talked about pocket tools like breath work. We've talked about journaling and laughter, progressive muscle relaxation, proper use of vitamins and supplements and even healthy ways to eat. We've discussed top drawer tools like Tai Chi and Yoga. And we've also talked about power tools like clinical hypnosis, guided imagery and counseling. Any one of which might be beneficial for us. But the only way to find out if this can work, is to give ourselves the freedom to see if indeed something new might help us lessen our stress and keep us optimally well. So it all starts with being able to look at ourselves in the mirror and say, I give myself permission to take better care of myself. Remember we now have reams of research data showing what happens when we don’t adequately manage stress that is chronic in nature. And we can show that it has not only effects on our emotional well being, not just our spiritual being, but also our physical well being. My hope is that this program has offered you some insight into stress in your lives and may be in the lives of your loved ones. And also offered some opportunities by ways that we might manage that stress. Remember that managing that stress might translate into us having more control over our overall health and well-being. So we might rely more on ourselves and less on the healthcare system. And that can translate into the use of less medication. My hope is that by hearing this from a physician you understand that there are physical ramifications, physical problems that are tied to stress and that this might offer you additional freedom to say, you know this is something I need to act on and thus be optimally well.

23) Mindfulness Meditation with Dr. Joe Parisi 

01:16:25
DR. JOE PARISI Meditation has roots in all cultures. And what I would like to do is introduce you to a brief way of meditating. What we call mindfulness meditation. So in order to prepare yourself if you simply find a position for your body that feels comfortable and relaxed. A posture that feels dignified. Finding a way to situate your body so that your body can stay still and can begin to quiet down. Once you find that posture, if you'll simply rest your hands in your lap. And then as you feel ready, then gradually close your eyes, allowing your awareness now to settle into your body. Taking a moment to become aware of what your body is feeling like. The different sensations, paying attention to what it's like to be breathing. Inviting your body to begin to let go of tension wherever you might be experiencing it. And allowing yourself to let go of the past, let go of the future and to begin to settle into the present moment. 

01:18:00
[sil.] 

01:18:05
DR. JOE PARISI As you feel ready, notice where you are experiencing your breath. Perhaps it's at the tip of your nostrils or may be you're aware of your abdomen or chest rising or falling. Wherever you're experiencing it, let your awareness come to this part of your body. You may experience sensations, thoughts, emotions while you're following your breathing. But let these stay in the background. Let your primary awareness simply be on each in-breath and each out-breath. 

01:19:00
[sil.] 

01:19:05
DR. JOE PARISI Perhaps your breathing will be slow, may be it will be fast. It might be deep or shallow. It really doesn’t matter. We don’t try to control the breath. We simply observe it, inviting ourselves simply to be present. Using the breath, to come back to the present moment. 

01:19:45
[sil.] 

01:19:55
DR. JOE PARISI If you find your mind is wandering away into thought, or may be perhaps getting caught in an emotion, simply note where it went gently saying to yourself thinking or feeling. And then ever so gently bring your awareness back to your breath. If your mind wanders away a hundred times, then you bring it back a hundred times. 

01:20:40
[sil.] 

01:20:45
DR. JOE PARISI Gently, and easily letting go. 

01:20:55
[sil.] 

01:21:05
DR. JOE PARISI Experiencing the body in this present moment. 

01:21:15
[sil.] 

01:21:20
DR. JOE PARISI Being aware of each in-breath and each out-breath. 

01:21:30
[sil.] 

01:21:40
DR. JOE PARISI Using the breath as a place to rest the mind. A place where your mind and body can come together with each in-breath and each out-breath. Letting go. Being present. 

01:22:00
[sil.] 

01:22:10
DR. JOE PARISI Resting quietly. 

01:22:15
[sil.] 

01:22:20
DR. JOE PARISI And then as you feel ready do slowly and gently open your eyes allowing your awareness to come back to the room. Experiencing whatever stillness might be present. Knowing that you've done a good thing for yourself by taking this time to pause, to be with yourself.
