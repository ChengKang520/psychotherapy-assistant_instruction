DANIEL AMEN Ah, as you find your seat, ah, I'm going to, ah, introduce our speaker, Dr. Claudia Black, ah, who is known internationally for her work in addictions and family systems and as a senior fellow, ah, at the specialist at the Meadows and is author of over 15 books including It Will Never Happen To Me and her most recent book Being Intimate Treason. Ah, this talk is gonna be one with, ah, lots of slides and it will take the entire time, ah, for, ah, Dr. Black to present her presentation so that will be no questions, ah, this particular, ah, presentation. So if you all, ah, join me in welcoming Dr. Claudia Black. 

00:00:45
CLAUDIA BLACK Thank you, Dan. Hello. I will stay afterwards on my own for people who do have some questions for probably no more than 15 minutes afterwards but I will do that. And so, well, it's great to be here. This is my third presentation this morning, now I need to say and, ah, but I came in on Wednesday so I'd say you will to listen and participate in different people's, ah, all long, ah, Thursday and a little bit on Friday. Some of you may have been Dr. Daniel Amen and myself yesterday morning where I really enjoyed our dialogue together. So, I'm glad you were there. We don't have a lot of time, so let me just really go ahead and begin. I began my work back in the 1970s in the addictions field and actually prior to that, uhm, I was quite young but still had a little bit of a crew prior to that and I actually had done rape prevention work, uhm, ah, of all things and, ah, but it was in doing that rape prevention work that gave me the opportunity to begin to work with audiences because I'd often go into small groups and talk about the dynamics of, ah, how to best protect oneself when there was a rape that would occur prior, ah, or there will be a social dialogue that would occur prior to an attack. So, when I came into the field of addictive disorders, my first job was in residential treatment center and the-- I was asked back in the '70s if I would develop a family program and the reason I was asked to do that is to broaden an MSW, the need to the social worker at that time for JCAH reasons and then asked me to develop a family program. I didn't ask questions. I had been raised in an addictive home and sometimes when you raise with addiction you learn how not to ask questions and you learn to make assumptions that's a bit of form of survival some of us kids, so to speak. And so I assume that when they asked to develop a family program they want me to work with whole families. So I began to invite the families and the partners, the spouses. I began to invite, ah, the kids in-- the young kids four and five, nine and 10, 15 to 16 but back in the '70s the people who came into treatment tended to be older on an average age old than they are today and so many of them were of adult age, their children and I really wasn't quite sure what else to be doing with all of them. They weren't any models of what to do with all of these people so I literally just separated them into groups according really to age and it was from my work with young adolescent and adult age children that I really began to see what was happening on a continual basis and ultimately what was happening on a delayed basis in terms of what this children will take with them into their adult life. Well, that was also showing oneself for me because you really saw that a lot in partners, many of them had ones been raised in addictive homes and it also show the self-- with the people who were addicted because many of them had been raise in addictive homes and that would really be the beginning of what would be your really important career for myself. But I made an assumption about what they want me to do. All they really want me to do was to work with the wives. Now, I want you to hear that language back in the '70s the wives. One, everything was seen through heterosexual ends but two, nine out of 10 people who came into an addiction treatment program at that time were men. So my job was to work with the wives and my job from their perspective was to teach these wives how not to enable and that if I could just teach this women how not to enable their husbands then this men just might have a chance to becoming clean and so on. So, you quickly can pick up the tuner here that everything in the family program they wanted me to create was really about one, focused on the addict but two had nothing to do with the whole family as a system in terms of their healing and recovery process but I also want to put into the context those who are probably the years of leave it to fever and father knows best as well and what I realize is I didn't have my clicker up here.

The Addictive Family: The Legacy of Trauma with Claudia Black, Ph.D. www.claudiablack.com Senior Fellow and Addiction & Trauma Program Specialist The Meadows Alcohol and drugs are like dominoes. They knock down the person who knocks down everyone including themselves. alcohol and drugs alcoholic addict Everyone 

00:04:50
CLAUDIA BLACK So, what I wanna say is unfortunately addiction doesn't just belong to the addict it belongs to the family system as well and that has been said to be the gift that goes on giving, giving and giving. And said very eloquently by little child that was in the group with me quite a while ago. He says, "alcohol and drugs and like dominoes. They knock down the person who knocks down everybody else including themselves." What we know today is that the impact that the addict-- the addicted person may have and that the addiction has whether or not the addiction is of behavioral addiction or substance addiction. The impact that both the addicted person and the addiction has on the family does not simply disappear because the addicted person may experience their own recovery process. So then, does addiction shows up spontaneously in the context of a family system. The chronic stress within that family system is become toxic and the adverse childhood responses affecting the neurobiology of this family are very strongly ingrained. Someone say that again, within this family system the chronic stress has become toxic and the adverse childhood responses that are affecting the neurobiology of this family system are strongly engaged. I wanna introduce to such family. 

00:06:15
Depression Anxiety 

00:06:15
CLAUDIA BLACK I wanna introduce to Therese. Now, Therese is first seen professionally in a community mental health center and when she goes to that community mental health center she doesn't go there as the wife of an addict. She doesn't go there as the daughter of an addict. She doesn't go there because of her own addiction. When she walks into a community mental health center, she walks in with the major depression and, ah,-- major anxiety disorders. Now, this is after her second divorce from her second addicted husband and it is not until this last divorce and they brought approximately nine year marriages-- does not until this last divorce that she's reach out for help. She's very clinically depress we have a major depression going on. This is a woman that when she walk she is truly shuffling. When she speaks, her speech is slurred. She's having difficulty making the most basic of decisions. She is very poor self-care. She is very diminished expectations and I think very appropriately is treated with medication with anti-depressants but it doesn't take too long after, ah, she begins to respond to this anti-depressants that we now have a woman in full bloom panic attacks in what the community mental health center will come to realize is that we need a differential diagnosis and that we really need to treat her both for the cooccurring mood disorder and to her anxiety disorder as well. And she gets treated for both her anxiety and to her depression without, ah, changing medication here. Well, what I'm gonna say to you as we can treat your anxiety and we can treat your depression but unless we look at the underlying issues that few fact she is so far repetitively getting into committed relationships with addicted people. I think the prognosis for somebody such as Therese is going to be very, very poor. Now, for just a moment, let me introduce you to her partners. 

00:08:15
Depression Anxiety Husband #2 Alcohol & Drug addict Husband #1 Alcoholic Father Violent Alcoholic Mother Codependent Rageful Father Emotionally needy Mother Family poor Father absent/alcoholic Mother chronically ill Sister Died Age 9 Brother Compulsive Overeater Grandfather Alcoholic gambler Grandmother Compulsive overeater Rageful Grandfather Chronic poverty Grandmother Died shortly after birth of father 

00:08:20
CLAUDIA BLACK Okay, this last husband is-- her last husband is both addicted to alcohol and other drugs and her first husband was predominantly to alcohol-- predominantly an alcoholic here. Now, it isn't the coincidence that this woman has married to addictive men. So, we're gonna take a look at her parents. She was raised in a very physically threatening alcoholic family system. She had a father that was extremely been little into her. He verbally shamed her. He dismissed her presence in the favor of siblings. He controlled her dress right down to her hairstyles. He actually did the hair cutting. She listen to her parents argue on a nightly basis that would keep her up. She often was sleep deprived. She had a mother that was very frightened. She had a mother that was very needy. Now, it is not a coincidence that either this men would marry her. They came from family systems that were very similar to the family system that she came from. This last, ah, man came from a system that was probably most identical to her. He came from a system were the mother was an extremely emotional needy mother and he came from a system which it was very rageful father. There wasn't an act of substance abused though. And then, the first husband actually came from a home were there was a love object poverty within that home. There was a father that was frequently absent and there was a father that was alcoholic as well. Well, let me also remind you that I said that Therese had siblings. When Therese was growing up in terms of looking at some of the adverse childhood experiences that she would have, she also had a sister that would die and this was the sister that was slightly older than her and she died in a car accident. She had a brother that at the very young age have become a compulsive overeater and continue to do that into his adult life. But if we wanna go little bit further in this family system. What we see is that what it is that she experienced with her parents actually proceeded that generation. On her mother side of the family, the grandfather was an alcoholic but he also was a compulsive gambler and the grandmother was a compulsive overeater and she was a very angry woman who acted out in very rageful ways. On the part of her father, he had a mother that would die very shortly after birth and that he have a grandfather that had been subject to a lot of chronic poverty here. Again, what we can see is the repetition that is permeated now three generations. So, what I really want to say is that Therese didn't get to this place of walking into a mental health center in a major anxiety and major depression having come out of two divorces from addicted men. She didn't get to this place over night. Her childhood history portrayed in this genogram was her training ground long before she entered any of those addictive relationships for her she had learned prior to this relationships.

There's Family of Origin Issues • Overlook (deny, rationalize minimize) behavior which hurt deeply • Appear cheerful when hurting • Make excuses for the hurtful behavior • Avoid conflict to minimize futher anger • Tolerate inappropriate and hurtful behavior • Prioritize the needs of other over own • Caretake others • Fautl self for family's problems • Discount own perceptions give others benefit of the doubt • Believe no options are available • Believe she is at fault, it is her job to find the answers • Not ask for help • Accommodate 

00:11:30
CLAUDIA BLACK She had learned to overlook. She had learned to deny, minimize, discount and rationalize, that which was hurting her deeply. She had learned how to appear cheerful in the face of what was hurting her deeply. She had learned how to make excuses for other people's hurtful behaviors. She had learned what I refer to his high tolerance for inappropriate behavior. She had learned to do whatever that she could to avoid conflict and to minimize anger. She learned to prioritize the needs of others over her own. She had learned how to care take others. She had learned how to discount her own perceptions giving other people the benefit of the doubt. She couldn't see options that were available to her behaviors that would fuel her depressions and her anxieties. She had come to believe that she was at fault and therefore she's at fault that she's gone to some hospitals to come for the answers. And she had learned at a very young age not to ask for help and like me, she probably also learned how not to ask questions. She had learned at a very young age that her survivorship is based on a lot of accommodation. She is truly reared to be the perfect candidate to partner with an addict and it doesn't matter what the addiction is. She is reared to be the perfect partner for an addict whether it is a substance abuse, whether it's gambling, whether it's a sex addiction and what you see is that this family of origin traits that I have listed here what we're going to do is they're going to be able to enable this person in their addiction to be able to act out their addiction with very little disruption.

Depression Anxiety Husband #2 Alcohol & Drug addict Husband #1 Alcoholic Father Violent Alcoholic Mother Codependent Rageful Father Emotionally needy Mother Family poor Father absent/alcoholic Mother chronically ill Sister Died Age 9 Brother Compulsive Overeater Grandfather Alcoholic gambler Grandmother Compulsive overeater Rageful Grandfather Chronic poverty Grandmother Died shortly after birth of father Son Age 7 Daughter 10 

00:13:05
CLAUDIA BLACK Now, at the time that she shows up at the community mental health center, I wanna remind you that he has two children. At the time that she shows up at that community mental health center, she has daughter who is 10 years of age and a son who is 7 years of age. And then, I just want you reflect on what is it has been passed out through the generations to them. Through the generations, they're going to have rageful behavior pass down. They're gonna have substance abuse pass down. They're gonna have all those things that create both depression pass down and I'm going to say to you that I do not think that at this stage, Therese is capable of parenting this children in a way that protects them and buffers them from this generational impact, not only as Therese is not capable yet because she's barely in treatment for her depression and her anxiety and not in treatment for this other underlying issues but the father's aren't in a position. They're not showing enough interest in the kids to even intervene and what you have is a very weakened extended family system. 

00:14:10
Healthy Parenting Practices • Basic needs of safety, food, shelter • Appearance role modeling • Warm and supportive relationship between the parent and child • Parental monitoring and supervision • Maintaining awareness of the child's peer relationships • Understanding the child's individual risk level • Establishing appropriate parent child communication Amelia Arria, Ph.D. 

00:14:10
CLAUDIA BLACK Now, you're gonna see something like this and pretty much every mental health community behavior health system in our country. Probably sitting now on a desk, you're gonna see some kind of pamphlet or some kind of flyer that's gonna talk about healthy parenting practices with kids. I just happened to chose-- choose this particular one. It comes from Dr. Amelia Arria and she's in John Hopkins University and one of the things that we know, one of the things that we know that help children to build resilience and not engage in high risk self defeating behaviors is they need to have their basic needs met in terms of safety, food, shelter. They need to have appropriate role model, warm and supportive relationships between the parent and the child. They need the parental monitoring and supervision. We need to be aware of our child's peer relationships. We need to understand their individual risk level and we need to established appropriate parent-child communication. I think that was not added to that list that I'd like to add is that healthy rituals do a lot to help build resilience in the context of families as well but one more time when it comes to this kinds of parenting practices Therese, the father's in that family structure is probably not gonna be able to respond. So what you're seeing here is a genogram that portrays generational repetition and what that means is your gonna see that toxic stress repetitively active out. You're gonna see the accumulation of adverse childhood consequences and they result most frequently in trauma responses. I can say to you with great confidence, left untreated we will see Therese again and in fact, we're gonna see her again before this hour is up. It wasn't all that long ago that when we thought about trauma we really were thinking about situational traumas that when people begin to write and speak about trauma, they were talking about trauma in the context of shootings that take place. They were talking about trauma in the context of war. Trauma in the context of acts of terrorism. We would recognized the trauma that can occur for some people when there are natural disaster, your hurricanes, your tornadoes, your floodings. We would recognize how traumatic life is for families when their home were burn down. We recognize that some people experience trauma when they have car accidents but the majority of people who experience trauma are going to experience a more subtle form of trauma and they're going to experience a more chronic form of trauma and that trauma is most up to occur within their own family systems. What we also heard as people first began to talk about trauma and what we would see as people would portrayed that moments of trauma is you would see people running from that which was traumatic and we recognize they were running from that which was traumatic but then we also recognize they won't just running from, they were running towards something. And typically, as we were addressing the situational traumas they were running from that which was traumatic and running towards home where they believe they would find safety. So I think the most obvious question here is, where do you run when that which is traumatic exist within that family system? Where do you run when that which is traumatic exist within that family system when it is not physically safe, when it is not psychologically safe to be who you are, to own your truth, to say what it is you see and how it is you feel. Then, what happens as these are people who typically move into your trauma responses in moving to the fight, they move into the flight, and they move into the freeze. We know today that people did not have the ability to distinguish between the emotional emergency and that which is physically dangers. People don't have the ability to distinguish between and physically they don't have the ability to be distinguish between an emotional emergency and that which is physically dangerous. So, when trigger, what happens? They respond by pumping out stress chemicals that allow them to be able to either stand and fight to their position or pump out stress chemicals that allow them to be able to flee that process. Well, for family remembers where there is addiction many times the opportunity to stand and fight isn't going to happen and certainly isn't intended to be offer healthy outcome. For many of them, the ability to flee isn't going to be there and so, what we often see is that many of them are gonna move into a freeze response. When I did my original adult-children from alcoholics work in essence we were talking about some of this already. I was beginning to say that as I began this morning, when I did my original adult-child work we were taken to look at was how would is people when they don't have an opportunity for intervention, they don't have an opportunity for their own healing process in the context of living with active addiction and even sometimes in recovery if they're not having an opportunity to be a part of that therapeutic process as well. They will take with them their faulty beliefs that they internalize. They will take with them their shame base beliefs. They will take with them their defenses they created to protect themselves from the shame that they have internalize and those defenses have become skills. And then, those skills could acted out in the way that they will interfere as they move into adulthood and every important area of their life. It will affect them in their parenting skills. It will affect them in their intimate relationships. It will affect them in their work and it certainly affects them in relationship to self as well. And then the essence, some of that work with really proceed that which we work with today as we work with people who are in trauma responses. Trauma is very option what it is that you're addressing when you're confronted with addicted disorders, when you're confronted with repetitive hurtful relationships, when you're confronted with addictions and confronted with depressions. Now, the trauma that occurs in a context of addicted families is both blatant and can be more subtle. The trauma that occurs in a context of addicted families could be more blatant that some trauma specialist think of this as big T traumas and certainly at the same time when you have your big T traumas you always have your little T traumas. The trauma in the context of the addicted home. I tuned to not use the language of big T and little T because it seems like for me, and this is just my bias is that when you, you make something, ah, capitalize and something not capitalize still diminishes, ah, the impact of what is so chronic in that which is much more subtle. 

00:20:45
Violence come's with the Alcohol. I'll smack you any time I want Oh know you won't. I'm scared. 

00:20:45
CLAUDIA BLACK Now, blatant forms of trauma in the context of an addictive family is the violence that comes with the alcohol. "I'll smack you any time I want." And the wife in this case is saying, "Oh, know you won't." And what we have happen to be a 12-year-old boy. A 12-year-old child in between who's today because he has a, a therapeutic process from which engage is able to talk about his fear. My experience is that by the time children in 9 years of age. They have a well-developed denial system and that which they are denying the most are their feelings. I had a 12-year-old boy and he was seen me individually and he didn't really wanna be there but his family wanted him to be there and so he was compliant enough that he came in and we were talking about what life was like for him at home. And he did, ah, discuss with me the fact that one day and actually mom had also told me about this incident in fact that one day he was on the back of the house, he was in the backyard and he heard some screaming going on. He though it was in the house and hear a lot of swearing going on. So, he made his way from the back of the house and he kept following noise and kept following the swearing and he know was his dad and he got out into the from porch and when he got unto the front porch what he saw was his dad was staggering across the front yard. Staggering across the front yard in his under clothes screaming obscenities that two boys that were coming to visit John in his house. They were his friends. Well, John, gets to the fortune time to sort of take the scene end as he's doing that he sees some neighbors come out unto their front porch across the street, the mother and a younger sister come running, everybody sort of running to where the noise is and as they all seem to culminated the same time, Dad, passes out. Just drops in the front yard. Well, somebody calls for sheriff. Now, it's interesting that in call for an ambulance, they'd call for a sheriff. The sheriff takes about 20 minutes to get there, by then, everybody has moved and now, they've all circled that. They've encircled them and sheriff finally just holds them off. So the point, they have the opportunity to work with John, I said, "You know, how was that for you that day that you know, your dad you know, scream those obscenities that your friends are coming to visit you, your neighbor see this, your sister and mother see this and-- when he said this all this you know, vulgar things like, he just know passes out drunk, his under clothes. So how is that for you?" This 12-year-old boy looked to me and he said, "What do you mean how, how was that for me?" And I was trying out to put words into his mouth so I said, "Well, you know, what did you feel?" And he said, "Feel? And as I began to twitch, feel and I have seen that multiple times. It was as if it was a foreign word, feel." And he kept repeating in and I said, feel. He said, "I don't know what you mean." So I said, "But John, did you feel angry with your dad for putting you in that situation?" He said, "No, he's put me in that situation before." I said, "Well, is that embarrassing." "No, it's probably gonna happen again." I said, "Did you feel sad for your mother and your sister?" "No, why would I feel sad for them?" That little boy and I said a little boy even though he's 12-years of age and he can be 5'8 by I just need to remind people we're talking about developmentally at 12-year-old child. He not only was loosen the ability in which to be able to identify his own feeling but he was also loosen the ability already to be able to be empathetic to other people in their feelings that lack of capacity in which to be able to feel in reference to his mother and his sister. So, we would continue to work in after a few more sessions that I felt we're a little bit more safe for him I've wrote in the piece of poster paper and I said, "John, I like you and I to make a list of feelings that we think people have. Now, I don't help you with it. Just people in general. You don't have to have them," and together we came up with 18 feelings that we think you all might have. And then, I ask them one at the time to check off the feelings that somewhere in his 12 years he identified with and he checked off 12 feelings in his 12 years that he had identified with 12 out of 18. But then, I want you to notice for the ones that he didn't have. He wasn't lonely, angry, scared, embarrass or sad. Lonely, angry, scared embarrass or sad, I think the other one was humiliation. That were six feelings he didn't have. So I said, "Why is it you think that other people might have those feelings but you don't?" And he said, "Well, maybe because I have to be tough and they don't." So while working with people who are 20 years of age or working with people who are 40 years of age, working with people who are 60 years of age, they have had a lifetime of disconnection, of disconnection from emotion of what it is that's going on in their lives. Now, when we think of the blatant violence in this families, we certainly think of the physical abuses and the sexual abuses and I know some of you have been with me a couple of the times already, so I'm gonna repeat this piece again but in substance abuse in homes, children are three times of more likely to be physically abused and that is the pushing and the shoving and the kicking and the pinching and the slamming somebody up against the wall until their teeth rattled. But just as important is what happens in this picture here and that is the witnessing of abuse which is even a greater, ah, frequency of experience for this kids. Today, we know about the witness experience. It was something that was identified couple centuries ago. I first began to read about with the phenomena called railways spine when people were in train accidents back in the 1840s and it was a primary mode of transportation and then, in the civil war we had a phenomenal day with refer to as soldiers heart and then in World War I this became identified as shell shock and in Vietnam were began to identified as post-traumatic stress syndrome and what would quickly began to recognize with our Vietnam veterans is that if you have equivalent combat exposure those people who were physically injured were less act to experience PTSD than those were the witness of and I think that is ramifications of what it goe-- what happens in violent families as well. And we also know is for those who are combat veterans who have PTSD they're more likely to experience that when they come from a troubled family history where there was also abuse here. Now, I'm not gonna say that I think everybody raised in an addicted families. It's gonna have enough of the pain and the chaos of what it is that I have described to generate PTSD but I am gonna say that when you witness family violence particularly if its repetitive, particularly when seen at those earlier ages in chronic. It most often will produce trauma related disorders. I also want to speak to the sexual abuse. Daughters in substance abuse in homes and the research is more in substance abuse and not on other types of, ah, addictive behaviors. Daughters in substance abuse in homes are two times more likely to be sexually abuse than females in non-substance in homes by a somebody that within the family or outside of that family system. Sons are four times more likely to be sexually abused in the substance abuse in home compared to males not in the substance abuse in home. I also want to say that when both parents are substance abuse or it is the likelihood of sexual occurring for both males and female substantially increases and I also wanna say that in the course of my work that after many, many years in my work I came to realize that if I'm working with somebody of adult age and they have been sexually abused there is more often and not one perpetrator or likely do not there will be more than one perpetrator. Now, if I'm working with an adolescent there may still at this time only yet to be one perpetrator but without intervention as people go on to their adult lives often times your gonna find that there's been more than one, ah, perpetrator in their life. 

00:28:45
Children of addiction are 2 to 4 times more likely to be sexually abused. They are prime for victimization as they... 1. Are often starving for attention 2. Are less apt to speak up because of fear of not being believed 3. Give others the benefit of the doubt. 4. Don't trust their own perceptions. 5. Don't know what they feel and can't use feelings and cues as signals. 6. Are confused about appropriate boundaries. 7. Experience shame upon shame which fuels powerlessness. 

00:28:45
CLAUDIA BLACK Now, some of the reasons-- gosh, I just-- I see myself of their and like, oh my god, hold your chin high. Ah, oh my, my, my. I'm trying not to look. We're get the slide out. Some of the reasons and I did show this when I actually did one talk, ah, earlier this morning this piece but some of the reasons that I think that if you raise with addiction that you may be more apt to be sexually abused is, is that this were children prime for victimization. We know that people often groomed those who they will victimized and they groomed them under the guise of friendship and these are children many times are not getting the attention that they need and I'm generalizing here. Uhm, that you know, certain some children in addicted homes have more stability than other children won't have but for those who were sexually abused often again, they're many times not getting the attention that children need and they can be groomed into the guys of friendship. These are children less up to speak up for the fear of not being believed because they were already in the family system were people do not speak the truth. They do not talk honestly about what it is, is going on. So, then I'll just have to speak up because they do not think that they will be believe. They are children already learning how to give others benefit of the doubt, how not to trust their own perceptions. Now, this is also setting people up to be in a victim role in life. That doesn't be know-- you know, when you learn all this you necessary gonna be sexually abused. You're already learning this. It certainly sets you up though for victimization in capacity of different ways. So, they give other benefit of the doubt. They learn how not to trust their own perceptions. As I said earlier, they don't know what they're feeling and the reason feelings are so important and one of the reasons it's so important is they're accusing indicators telling us what it is we need and I can't act on what it is that I need if I don't have that cueing indicator to help me here. They're already children confused about what constitutes appropriate boundaries and limits and there already children generalizing the shame-base belief with who they are is not okay that they are not a value that somehow they are not worthy. So, when I already have a shame dynamic in incorporated into my very soul and then something else happens is also shaming in essence but you have a shame could upon already existing shame. And that's much more act to fuel inaction and in a mobilization versus that child's ability to let somebody know what it is that's going on. Now, as with physical abuse sometimes it's very blatant, sometimes, is not as blatant as that more of the witnessing of abuse but with sexual abuse is not always physical touch. It could be the drunken nudity that occurs in the context of the home. It could be the exposure to pornography, uhm, that could be going along, ah, with one of the addictions that is there. But as a one woman's said is name calling-- is sexual name calling being call the whore, a bitch, a slut, and then as woman said to me who's in treatment for her own, ah, substance abuse she said, you know, "We got call of these names, my sisters and myself. My dad call us all those names but those names really won't so bad. I mean, he could, you know, I mean, so we called us slut, so what's the big deal?" He said, "It was when you'd call me by my mother's name, flow." And then he give that look and say, "I wish I was young so I could have a shy to you. She said that as when I felt so dirty, dirty." Again, yet, that were just more subtle and which is traumatic to people and again, it doesn't have to be in addicted home we have lots of different types of other what I call shame based homes, impaired family systems is what it means to live in a family with chronic fear and I think if there's any feeling that permeates addiction that is fear, really for everybody for the prime-- for the adult and for any kids that maybe raised in that environment. So, what I want you to think about is the impact of fear, a five years of age, a 10 years of age, 15 years of age, when you're developing your sense of worth, your developing your identity, you developing beliefs about yourself and beliefs about the world at large. That is the small T here. 

00:33:10
I feel Scared When my mother drinks Im scared 

00:33:10
CLAUDIA BLACK And with all that fear comes the usually the less measurable forms of abuse, verbal abuse, name calling, blaming, criticizing, the emotional abuse that comes with the broken promises, the line, the unpredictability, not knowing e-- what it is, is gonna happen next. 

00:33:30
Emotional Abandonment Abandonment When you have to hide a part of who you are in order to be acceptable/ to protect self. When you have to hide: -Your mistakes/ vulnerabilities - Your feelings - Your needs - Your accomplishments/ success 

00:33:30
CLAUDIA BLACK This is what I think of is emotional abandonment. Let me define that for you for a second. Emotional abandonment as I work with that it is when you have to hide a part of who you are in order to be acceptable but what I wanna say is that for some people acceptance wasn't going to be had. They had the high parts of who they were something to protect themselves and when that happens that usually implies for greater deprivation in their life and it may imply as well for a more blatant abuse that is occurred in their life. Sounds like cycle up, although when you use that language over the client. When you have to hide a part of who you are in ordered to be acceptable or you have to hide a part of who you are in order to protect yourself so what is that mean. Was it okay in the family which you were raised to make a mistake but what I wanna say is abandonment is not something that just occurred someone's family system when I work with people around abandonment-- I do a lot of work with people around abandonment. One of the things that, uhm, gonna be doing is taken in look at abandonment that most often occurred with clients I work within their growing up years but as you work with people around their adult to adult relationships, their intimate relationships you're also working with the phenomena of abandonment, you may refer to it differently but you are working with the phenomena of abandonment. To what degrees-- and my another way of thinking about abandonment I have a line up here. I have total acceptance here and absolute rejection to think in terms of a 150% total acceptance, absolute rejection. And what you have in between are varying degrees of emotional availability or unavailability and what you have in between is indifference and their respect to somebody's needs and wants. So, as a child what degree where a parent's emotionally available or unavailable. In this relationship that I'm in today, to what degree are we with each other available or unavailable. So abandonment can happen one's growing up years. It can happen in the context of the coupleship but certainly as I work with people today individually I need to help them take a look at the phenomena of self-abandonment. We often do to ourselves today that which was one stand to us and the more I have a history of abandonment, the more I mapped to abandon myself today and what healing and recoveries about is really my taken accountability for how I go forward in life. So, I wanna take a look at how they may abandon them usually in a very similar ways in which there were once abandoned. So going back to this, abandonment, was it okay in the family which you were raised to make a mistake? Is it okay in your coupleship to make a mistake? Then, again, I don't need my partner, my husband, my wife. I don't need my mother, my father, whoever it was that raise me. I do a really good job, pointing my finger at my nose when I do anything less than perfect. I'm very quick to maybe tell myself how stupid I am when I can't get anything right, that maybe the way in which I abandoned myself. Was it okay in this original family to express the wide range of feelings that is part of our humanness? Is it okay in this coupleship or might the first one today to tell myself to suck it up when I get scared whether I have nothing to be angry about when in fact they have all kinds of things to be angry about or I have nothing to be scared about when in fact I made very well have things. Is it okay for me to have needs? People have gone to great lengths and take a way. Ah, our emotional reality they have gone the great lengths, ah, to help reinforce that other people's needs are more important in our own and so today, in this coupleship, is it okay for me to have needs? And then again today, is it okay for me to have needs just for myself? I have woman raise with two addictive parents. Married two or third addicted man and she still thought that was a coincidence. So, I'm doing an individual session with her. Her husband is coming to a treatment program. I do a lot over the course of my years I have done most of like work in residential treatment as I've work with addiction. So, I'm seeing her individually and I said, "While your husband is here what is it that you need?" Thought it was pretty adequate social work psychology type question. "While your husband is here, what is that you need?" 

00:37:40
[sil.] 

00:37:45
CLAUDIA BLACK Well, she didn't say anything. She look like she might be contemplating the question. She look like the question was a bit perplexing for her. Then, she looks a little disturbed and then her body language said, "let's move on." I was pretty young in my career when this actually happened. I thought it was pre-decent social work type question. At that time I didn't have my Ph.D. and I was very stiff to my social work practice and I have a lot of confidence. That was a pretty good social work type question. So, you know, with the great compassion, you know, I said, "Do you even taken care of people in your whole life two alcoholic parents, three alcoholic husbands, two little boys, do you even taken care of people in your whole life? During your time your husband is here with us, what is it you need?" And that woman, for a moment didn't contemplate the question, she was busy looking for those green exit signs, she wanted out of here. Well, I, I still felt that was a fairly good mental health type question to ask to this client. But I know I'm not the only one here, I was raised in an alcoholic home and sometimes when you raise in a home with addiction you can become very controlling. I really did want an answer to my question. Some of us any addiction feel a little bit more self-disclosure than others but I really did want an answer to my question. So again, with great empathy and compassion and then I you know, I went inside and, and I develop a lot of empathy and compassion. There my father earlier he was quite empathetic and compassion and I got that from him and I said, it is been tough. Your life has been so tough. Two alcoholic parents, three alcoholic husbands, and that woman came out of her chair. She came out of her chair, head first, you know, I'm sitting back here, head first, knee came up. I thought the knee was gonna hit here in the nose. I had never yet seen a convulsion I would assume as any convulsion. I'd never yet seen a convulsion. I thought that will almost gonna have a convulsion and I did not know what to do. So I grabbed her that's the only thing you made sense to me, I grabbed here where she was really jerking the most. I grabbed her on the shoulder and I grabbed her on the knee and I very gently put her back into her chair and that this moment, I've-- I'm holding on, I'm touching her, I got her just gently back into this chair and I have compe-- say we were nose to nose. And I said, "One more time." That was a great therapeutic intervention though, trust me. Hopefully, at that point I was trusting my clinical skills versus my need to being controlled and, ah, I said, "What is it you need right now?" Actually, what I did before that as I told her the day that we could was I told her where she was, I told her what time at the night it was because I wasn't sure she was oriented. And I said, "What is it you need right now," and I have to tell you that woman said that which make the most sense to me. First of all she back her nose away from my nose. She looked to me straight in the eye, she didn't wink, she didn't jerks, she simply didn't have a convulsion. She said, "Where? Where in my 44 years? Huh, where in my 44 years do I get to ask me what it is that I need, huh?" And then when I do I feel so guilty. You could feel, you could feel the energy of the shame she experienced for her in her humanness in this case a woman would needs but it could been a man with needs. The shame that she had attached to the fact that in her humanness she would have needs. I can pretty much guarantee when you don't know what you're needs are they're not gonna get with any consistency and I can pretty much guarantee you when you don't know what your needs are they're not met with any kind of consistency you're gonna end up depressed or you're gonna end up angry and, and many cases then what we do is we engage in a lot of other self defeating behaviors. 

00:41:45
Emotional Abandonment When you cannot live up to expectations of significant other due to expectations being unrealistic. When someone is disappointed with you they attack your whole being, worth, and value versus what you did or did not do. When another expects you to be an extension of themselves fulfilling their dreams. When another is not willing to take responsibility for their feelings, thoughts, and behaviors but expects you to take responsibility for them. When parents' esteem is derived through child's behavior. When children are treated as peers with no parent child distinction. 

00:41:45
CLAUDIA BLACK So let me go back to this. I'm just gonna quickly go through this. Other forms of abandonment is when you cannot live up to expectations of a significant othe because they're unrealistic when somebody is disappointed with you and versus to speak to what you did or didn't do they attack your worth, you identity, your value. When another expects you to be an extension of them fulfilling their dreams. When another is not willing to take responsibility for their thoughts, feelings but expects you to take responsibility for them. When parents' esteem is derived through child's behavior. And when children are treated as peers with no parent child distinction. Now, living with abandonment, you know that is living with insecure, that is living with disorganized, is living with avoid into attachments styles and what that means is people as a result are gonna internalize that shame base belief with who I am is not okay. 

00:42:40
SHAME Damaged Inadequate Dirty Not good enough Less than Stupid Damaged goods 

00:42:40
CLAUDIA BLACK Now, when they are in shame they think of themselves as this woman damaged, dirty, inadequate, not good enough, less than, stupid other words might be broken, I don't know if I have worthless up there. These are just some of the words. I don't think of myself as in shame, I think of myself is not good enough. I think of myself as less than. I think of myself as inadequate. And obviously shaming since long are continue when you're gonna hear words like, dirty, damaged and damaged goods the more the deprivation and the more of the likelihood of physical abuse, ah, of, of blatant abuses.

We construct labyrinth defenses and a moat around our heart to allow some semblance of safety from our grief. Unattended sorrow gradually displaces the joy of youth and adds to the diminishment of trust and hope. Stephen Levine, Unattended Sorrow 

00:43:15
CLAUDIA BLACK I wanna share with you the words of Stephen Levine and his book Unattended Sorrow cuz I think he summarizes sort of where we go with that. What happens is where a personal goal with that is they're gonna construct labyrinth defenses and the moat around their heart to allow some semblance of safety from their grief. The unattended sorrow gradually displaces the joy of youth and adds to the diminishment of trust and hope.

Dear Lord- Be good to me, the sea is so wide and my boat so small. Epigram for the National Children's Defense Fund 

00:43:45
CLAUDIA BLACK I wanna remind you of the epigram for the National Children's Defense Fund it says, Dear Lord, Be good to me, for you see the sea is so wide and my boat is so small. The child's personality, the child's neurology, the little boat that the physical body their brain, that little boat that they need to navigate in, in essence of still developing for them.

Trauma "stress that causes physical or emotional harm from which you cannot remove yourself" Larke Huang (SAMHSA) 

00:44:10
CLAUDIA BLACK The words out of, ah, ah, federal substance abuse to mental health agencies SAMHSA trauma defined as stress that causes physical and emotional harm from which you cannot remove yourself. 

00:44:20
Types of Stress • Positive - associated with moderate short-lived physiological responses • Tolerable - associated with physiological responses that can disrupt brain architecture, but relieved by supportive relationships • Toxic - associated with strong and prolonged activation of the body's stress management system in the absence of buffering protection 

00:44:20
CLAUDIA BLACK Today we recognize that there's three predominant forms of, ah,-- of, of stress. There is positive stress. Stress can either be growth promoting or can be seriously damaging. In growth promoting stress is that which is associated with moderate short-live physiological responses. It's a stress that comes with meeting a new person. The stress that comes of having to take a test. The stress that might come with standing up and giving the talk to hundreds and hundreds of people. Then we have tolerable stress. It is associated with physical responses that can disrupt brain architecture, but are relieved by supportive relationships. Now, that which causes the stress could be a significant as the loss of a relationship. It certainly could be something as serious as a natural disaster but can be tolerable one if it is the more short brief it is. It can often be more tolerable but it is most often more tolerable because they are supportive people in somebody's life to again offer comfort, comfort and support at this particularly stressful time. This tolerable stress becomes traumatic particularly when it coincides with the toxic conditions of childhood which could be a chronic poverty, ah, persistent of mental illness in the context of a family could be, ah, a lot of criminality in the context that a family in certainly addictions that was again associated with strong and prolonged activation of the body's stress management system in the absence of buffering protection here. Toxic stress can fundamentally change the trajectory of somebody's life because that brings stress responses and this vulnerable to disruption by toxic stress during that child's development what happens here is that the exposure that they're experiencing, this toxic stress can change the way to that brain is going to both interpret and respond the stress issues and what that usually means that makes this client much more likely to experience your mood disorders and your anxiety disorders here and as I experience on any continue of a mood disorder or an anxiety disorder what often happens is a more act to seek out substances or behaviors that are gonna roos-- reduce the anxiety or improve my mood and that often is going to fuel addictive behavior. You cannot work in the field of addictive behavior without willingness in which to assess and respond to the cooccurring, ah, mental health dynamics as well. Let me show you the words of one man who is in treatment for both his heroin addiction and his depression. He said as he talked about his growing up years. His father, a very rageful man. He said, "it was the center of his pathos, it was the center of his insanity that hurt and overwhelmed me. Fill on me more than the-- than with the pain from the physical abuse that occurred it filled me with black despair. I could not wait for his ritual to end so that I could take to bed, pulled up covers, pull the covers up over me and falling to a deep sleep. Later in adolescence, I began to find that same sweet release in drugs and then, and then the thrill of risk taking." When it comes to depression, depression is about many thing since very complex and if it has very good presentations on you know, ah, mood disorders here at this very conference but I want to acknowledge that a lot of depression certainly filled by habitual pessimistic disorder views of the world, for better to learn that than in a addictive system but a lot of the depression that I worked with is about incomplete sorrow and pathological grief. Incomplete sorrow and pathological grief, people have had continual loses in their life, they haven't had the safety and they loss skill in which to be able to grief those loses. So a lot of the depression I-- in working with depression certainly they are times where its very indicated, ah, me-- medication would be indicated but I also think we obviously have to do the cognitive behavioral work, that's feeling a lot of the faulty thinking is going on but we also need to do the affective work because of the emotional pain that is so associated to the loses and as I said they do not have the skills nor they have the safety in which to be able to grieve. But I wanna caution you a little bit about people who come from shame base histories. They develop skills that other people didn't have to develop just for their own sake of emotional, social, psychological maybe physical and certainly spiritual survivorship or they develop skills that the rest of us develop but they needed to develop and to a greater extreme than everybody else did and of those things that we all do in our humanness or I can guarantee you cannot been at this conference for this last few days is we all learn how to compartmentalize, set aside certain things that are going on in our life so that we can pay attention to what it is that's in front of us. We all learn to do that but I want you think about learning that in the context of a shame base family system. I learned to compartmentalize when-- if I listen to my arguing night after night and say these really hurtful things to each other and I go up and go school and somebody knows that I'm tired the next day I don't say, "Yeah, let me tell you what my dad and mom-- my mom said to each other last night." I do whatever as I can to distract myself from that reality. Sometimes as kids we had call and cross the living room floor because they were afraid that somebody is gonna shoot out the windows. Somebody from within their own family system when they go to school the next day they're not gonna say, "Hey! let me tell you about what happen in my family last night." They have a greater need to compartmentalize than somebody else does and that need is for them a form of emotional psychological survivorship. They become more skilled at it. I think that there are a lot of people who become what I refer to and this is not a clinical diagnosis, so please never put it down on a piece of paper. A lot of people experience what I see and that is a form of closeted depression. I worked with many, many people for the last when I first begin to recognize it was about 20 years when I had a program here, said in California was having people coming to psych hospital that I was overseeing 26 beds in and they were coming in from major depressions with lot-- strong histories of loss and trauma and many of them were extremely functional on a day to day basis in terms of what was required of them. Performing well in the work place, performing well in terms of what was required of them daily and yet, actively suicidal and in many cases have attempted to take their lives and that's when it didn't fit all these things we've learned about is sometime certainly of major depression, uhm. Now, what I want you to think about is people are raise in shame base family, they have a lot of loss, continual loss for years and then they have the need to deny that loss cuz its not safe to do anything with all the feeling associated to that loss. So where are those feelings go? They go inside. I don't have a language to work them through and when they go inside I don't have a way to which to work them through I think they amplifies like a molly ball that you put it into the wall. You tap it into the wall, little tendrils jump out and grab and hold and you get extra strength there. Well, our feelings go within and they amplify and they grab hold. Now, I want you to add a belief that says you're at fault and you are not worthy. And then, I want you add but you do whatever as you need to do in order to survive but one in front of the other. I see people easily, easily in their thirties and sometimes in their forties. Then, I had a wall that they never it coming. I had to hid that wall. They were confronted with another loss but they've been confronted with other losses. I think they've loss the ability to compartmentalize. It's amazing our defenses work as well as they do, five, 10, 15, 20 years sometimes even longer from that and in time they just quit working and as often when we see people get the help they've need it for a very long period of time. In their compartmentalizing was very, very difficult to see the result to spare. It is very, very difficult to see their self loathing. They're not wanting to be here and sadly sometimes people take their lives and it wasn't because people couldn't see it coming because they may have been so good in their ability in which to compartmentalize and then we see this continue to be repetitive in terms of the family legacy cuz after that and their addictions but oftentimes I saw different drug of choice I'm going to make so sure that I don't end up like my mother, there is no way I'm never gonna drink alcohol but something happens and a doctor puts me on pills and the next thing I know I'm additive for prescription pain pills but I'd like to tell you I'm not like my mom. And how many times and I-- I don't know if I said this in my last workshop I talked about, ah, partners of sex addicts. I cannot tell you the number of times women have said to me, "I think sure I didn't marry an alcoholic or drug addict like my father but I didn't understand that somebody could compulsively engage in sex and end up as a sex addict." So sometimes that repetition, ah, could be in terms of marrying and marrying somebody were in fact it is a different drug of choice here. What we know is that the great of the trauma that somebody has in their life the more likely they are to experience multiple addictive disorders is very seldom today and working in any addiction treatment field that you work with somebody who is just A. When I work with eating disorders I always have to screen for the likelihood of an addiction to a substance often speed derivative. It could be alcohol that often as be derivative. When you're for sex addicts you-- often alcohol but often speed derivative. When you're working with gamblers as often alcohol. When you're working with the, ah, substance abuser could be you know, the gambling or the spending addiction. We need to rule out. We need to assess for the possibility of-- and this is a phenomena we refer to as addiction interaction disorder. What we recognize as the people maybe at different stage in their addiction but that if we don't address the fact that we have more than one primary addiction going on even if the one isn't just problematic for them is very likely they're gonna relapse back to the primary drug of choice and even if they don't in the other one were just simply escalate and as process. Let me give you an example of what I'm talking about. I have a woman who was raised with a-- ah, she described it a very, very controlling mother, a very, very passive father, and she would be sexually abused by her uncle and she said at a very young age I found that food was my answer. Food was really my solution, it was a solution to the pain that I felt regarding the abuse, the pain I felt regarding the lack of protection but it was also my way of getting back at my mother because my mother tried to control everything about my life." And she said, "you know, one of the things I can remember, sitting at home on a couch with the bucket of ice cream," and she said, "I don't know what my father issues with my mother but he'd sit with me and have a bucket of ice cream. Now, we just medicate in our ice cream and my mom would come in and she just practically foam at the mouth," and she said, "you know, that was our way of saying, you know, screw you tomorrow." And she said, "and that's why became a compulsive overeater and she said, now that I got in the high school and she said I already knew how to be dishonest. I already knew how to be sneaky and already knew how to lie and she talk about how she did all that around her relationship with food and what it is that had happened with the sexual abuse and she said, but I starting to drink because that's what the kids were doing and then a wonderful thing happened the first time I was drinking I threw up. And she said, and then that would change the course of my compulsive eating disorder and she said, ultimately I became a bulimic and it didn't take a very long period of time. So when she comes in to treatment what we have is a bulimic woman who is also very much a substance abuser and for her, we can work with the fact that these are interactive. Her use of other substances as well as her food are both about anger, they are about power and they are about connection here and ultimately as well, we will need to go back and we will need to take a look, uhm, at the trauma that has occurred in her life for that ongoing healing process. I think I spoke yesterday that when it comes to relapse, we have some you know, basic guidelines, the willingness in which to follow direction, the willingness in which engage in ongoing recovery practices taken a look at your cognitive, ah, and your faulty kinds of thinking but how important it is to look at when trauma has play the role in terms of your use. How important it is, ah, to take a look at the fact that could be cooccurring disorders and the fact that often times are multiple addictive disorders here. 

00:57:10
Trauma Repetition 1. Doing something self destructive over and over again, usually something that took place in childhood and stared with a trauma 2. Reliving a "story" from the past 3. Engaging in abusive relationships repeatedly 4. Repeating painful experiences, including specific behaviors, scenes, persons and feelings Depression Anxiety Husband #2 Alcohol & Drug addict Husband #1 Alcoholic Father Violent Alcoholic Mother Codependent Rageful Father Emotionally needy Mother Family poor Father absent/alcoholic Mother chronically ill Sister Died Age 9 Brother Compulsive Overeater Grandfather Alcoholic gambler Grandmother Compulsive overeater Rageful Grandfather Chronic poverty Grandmother Died shortly after birth of father Son Age 19 Daughter Age 22 

00:57:15
CLAUDIA BLACK Now, we gonna need to let me see what I have here. Okay, let me show you this. I'm going to-- oh! I'm afraid run out of my time. Okay, I'm wanna go ahead of this. I said a little bit earlier that we would see Therese again. What we do, see Therese again and the one thing that you will notice to this different about his genogram is her children have aged 12 years. And guess when we see her again she was treated for her depression. She was treated for anxiety in life became more functional but without treating all these to the dynamics that I have talked about. It certainly was strongly interfere with parenting and today we have one more opportunity to intervene in her life that can be even more repair to than the early intervention 12 years ago and that is when her son comes to treatment for his substance abuse today. 

00:58:05
Possibility for Recovery • Identify primary disorders • Potential for cooccurring disorders and multiple addictions • Prioritize treatment of intergenerational family dynamics • Ask clients about their original family history • Ask pointed questions about the use of alcohol and other drugs • Ask the possibility of other addictive disorders • Ask about possibility of physical or sexual abuse • Recognize impact of chronic loss and stress as trauma factor 

00:58:10
CLAUDIA BLACK I think the possibility of recovery comes when we have the ability to identify the primary disorders and often times multiple. The potential for cooccurring disorders and multiple addictions and the willingness in which to prioritize treatment of intergenerational family dynamics, intergenerational family dynamics. We need to ask clients about their original family history. We need to ask pointed questions about everybody use of alcohol and other drugs. We needed to ask about the possibility of other addictive disorders and again, because they minimize we probably don't saw other addictions because they're gonna minimize. Can you tell me about the spending habits you know, ah, the people enjoy, enjoy gambling in your families? Ask about the possibility of physical or sexual abuse. Do people ever get hit push off because again people who experience this normalize that. Recognize the impact of chronic loss that's what we need to do is to recognize the impact of chronic loss and stress as a trauma factor. But what I do want to say because it also as that question is you know, how much trauma work can you really do with somebody's coming into treatment you know, primarily and their acting out and the disruption in their life is very much, ah, blatant in terms of their addictive disorders. In order for them to respond to the wonderful cognitive behavioral work that we do in the addictions field, you do need to do some things to lessen the reactivity in that limit system and that brings them regulation. So that's where we can, ah, right away begin to incorporate mindfulness practices. Right away being to incorporate meditation. Right away to incorporate breath work. Right away begin to incorporate the use of music in the context of sessions just subliminal and the background hoping to call that reactivity. Right away we can begin to use some of the expressive arts and then again depending on one what this person's relapse histories been, maybe they have enough traditional primary, ah, treatment experiences before for some of those people you're gonna do more, ah, direct trauma therapy work with them in terms of your SC, your EMDR, your energy pscy-- ah, therapist et cetera. Sometimes we need to do some of that just to stabilize them enough even begin a treatment process but over all we're probably gonna do this more trauma treatments a little bit for there down that road. 

01:00:40
Realistic & Important Goals • Lessen emotional reactivity, calm part of brain that keeps person in fight, flight or freeze state • Tolerate uncomfortable feelings without engaging in self defeating behavior • Stay in the present • Define boundaries that offer safety • Set appropriate limits that honor those boundaries • Recognize and disrupt shame based thinking and behavior 

01:00:40
CLAUDIA BLACK And lastly, realistic and important goals. To lessen the emotional reactivity, do what we can using this as said the mindfulness, your expressive arts, the music, to calm parts of the brain that keep them in the fight, flight or freeze. To help them learn to tolerate uncomfortable feelings without engaging in self defeating behaviors. I think this is critical in recovery. We need to teach them how to tolerate their feelings without engaging in self defeating behavior. We need to do whatever we can to help them stay in the present. We need to help them to find boundaries that offer them a sense of psychological safety and physical safety. We need to help them set appropriate limits that honor those boundaries. I think limit setting is the skill to boundaries and we need to recognize and disrupt shame based thinking and behavior. 

01:01:30
Do Not Ever Underestimate - the role you will play in someone's life when you empower them with validation and truth. 

01:01:35
CLAUDIA BLACK And lastly, I would like to conclude by simply saying, please don't ever, ever underestimate the role that you can play in somebody's life when you empower them with both validation and truth. Thank you for being with me.
