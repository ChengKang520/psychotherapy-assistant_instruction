DR. ANNA B. BARANOWSKY Remember the importance of creating a new positive habit and foundation to help you in your trauma recovery right now. Those who spend time daily to harness calm, do the best in their trauma recovery. Choose to spend a short time everyday to build the skills in your post-trauma self-care. Today's practice is: Use exercise daily in your recovery toolkit. We all know that exercise helps us weight, heart health, flexibility, strength and endurance. But what we're hearing more about now is that exercise and movement is good for us too, loads of research is supporting 3o minutes of exercise daily to improve mood and reduce anxiety. The American College of Sports Medicine, recommends 30 minutes of moderate physical exercise daily and the Surgeon General is on board with this as well. From the psychological perspective physical activity shows in incredible improvements, people show fewer signs of emotional difficulties and the University of Texas Medical Centre found that those who exercise 30 minutes each day are 50% less likely to suffer from symptoms of depression than those who do not exercise. We've all heard the term endorphins which are released in our brain resulting in feelings of wellbeing. Well, exercise will release these endorphins, enhancing feelings of calm and wellbeing. That's alpha wave activity, a kind of brain wave activities also increased to the brain and alpha wave activity is all about a clear and focused attention, less distractions, less worries, less concerns, less intrusive negative or fearful thoughts. Okay, I know exercise is not always an easy thing to start. And sticking with it, that takes the stuff I've been talking all along, determination and perseverance. Even though when you don't feel like it at first. Do whatever attracts you the most: walk, swim, jog, (inaudible ), cycle fit. It really actually doesn't matter. What matters is starting something. Let's practice together. First, set a time per say that you are going to do some kind of physical exercise daily. Start with a manageable goal, let's say 15 minutes to start and increase overtime to 30. And set the intention and be clear about exactly the time you gonna do this. For example, you might say to yourself, "I'm gonna wake up 15 minutes early and set my timer for about 15 minutes of movement whatever it is," whether it's a gentle stretching or you choose to do something a little bit more aerobic and vigorous, if you're already ready for a challenge. Set a timer and plan to start with seven days, just seven days to start. Two, it really doesn't matter what you do. Now, after you've finished make a note. How did you feel, while you are exercising? How did you feel, now that it's over? That's it, 15 minutes in a brief note. Three, by day seven, just reinforce what you've done and be clear about how you feel and how your body feels in comparison to the first day. You might have felt stiff and sore of when you started, if you just started out on day one and you weren't doing any kind of physical exercise, but by day seven if you are consistent and built up slow and steady, you'll likely be feeling good. The body can't lie, so this in itself is reinforcing. The idea is to go at a pace that you can manage, so you don't end up hating task. But, loving the feeling of movement, increase to something more aerobic if possible, as that is when the endorphins are really kicking. Further, reinforcing the delicious feeling like you get when exercising. Practice this throughout the day, whenever you need to recapture feelings of comfort or calm. Take the time right now to form a new healthy practice habit. Take a small step in the right direction. Dr. Anna Baranowsky from the Trauma Treatment Online Program. Remember daily practice is not a luxury item. Until tomorrow, have a gentle day.
