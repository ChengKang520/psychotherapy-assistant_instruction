What is emotion? 

00:00:15
Get many butterflies. 

00:00:20
No. 

00:00:20
You’re getting butterflies? 

00:00:20
Little bit. 

00:00:20
Yeah, you know the butterflies don’t breath at altitudes, so once you get up there we’re gonna be cool… we’re gonna be cool. 

00:00:25
Okay. 

00:00:25
Oh! never butterflies can't breathe at altitude, so... 

00:00:30
BRIAN KNUTSON How does it work? These questions long the focus of dreamers and philosophers are now it interests to scientists, and neuroscientist in particular.

With Brian Knutson, Ph.D. 

00:01:10
BRIAN KNUTSON Hello, I’m Brian Knutson, I'll be your personal tour guide on a brief visit to emerging field of Affective Neuroscience. This exciting you discipline(ph) examines how the brain generates emotional experience. Recent advances and techniques and methods have began to reveal a new view on the hidden and sometimes surprising workings of emotions. As you’ll see, Affective Neuroscience that uses every tool at its disposal. For example, my lab has used methods ranging from the measurement of non-verbal expression to the manipulation of brain chemistry to neuroimaging to study emotion in humans and in other animals. In this brief tour, will hit some of the emerging highlights of this exciting field. 

00:01:55
What are emotions? Why are emotions? Where are emotions? When are emotions? Implications 

00:02:00
BRIAN KNUTSON What are emotions? To measure something, scientist needed to define it. What exactly are emotions or what aren’t they? 

00:02:10
EMOTION input output 

00:02:15
BRIAN KNUTSON Emotion can be like into a bridge, something that connects “Input to Output”, but is neither input nor output. Input in our case is what we take in through our senses, what we see, what we touch, smell, and so forth, as well as the memories from past experience. Feeling a hand in ours, smelling the apple blossoms, remembering the taste of a delicious apple pie, seeing a snake in the grass. Output is the behavior we produce ranging from automatic to control it. For instance shrinking back, or moving forward. Emotion does not simply link one input to output as might have reflex. But instead coordinates and connects, many inputs and outputs. On the input end at any moment your senses could report millions things, the sound of a bird, the feel of swaying long grasses, the sight of a shadow on windswept tree, but your attention can only focus on a limited number of these sensations at any given time. 

00:03:35
[sil.] 

00:03:40
BRIAN KNUTSON On the output end, within the constraints imposed by the body, you could take any number of actions, but you can’t do everything at once. For instance, she want to approach or flee. How do we select and connect multiple inputs and outputs, emotion can help. 

00:03:55
Cognition: The symbolic or visual representation of things or events. "snake" Emotion: An evaluative, personal reaction to things or events. 

00:04:00
BRIAN KNUTSON Emotion has sometimes been contrasted with cognition. The two are undoubtedly connected, but one can distinguish them by defining cognition as the symbolic or visual representation of things or events. Whereas emotion is more related to evaluative, personal reaction to those things or events”. For instance, two people might receive the same objective information. 

00:04:25
So as we're get out of the plane that's when you do (inaudible ). Okay, yep… 

00:04:30
BRIAN KNUTSON But even given the same information, the two may have completely different objective responses. 

00:04:35
Are you guys ready? 

00:04:35
I’m ready. 

00:04:35
Good. Let’s do it, alright thank you. 

00:04:40
Alright. 

00:04:40
We’re going to board the plane climb on up. 

00:04:45
Anything else. 

00:04:45
No, that’s it. 

00:04:45
What do I do again? 

00:04:45
Good going... 

00:04:45
Wilhelm Wundt BAD GOOD valence Arousal LOW HIGH 

00:04:50
BRIAN KNUTSON Animals may not share all of our sophisticated cognitive abilities to think of things in many different ways, but considered distant past or future events. Yet research suggests that they may have the capacity or basic emotional experiences. If emotion is not simply sensory input or motor output, or even cognition, then what is it? In psychology, we can identify two ways of thinking about key characteristics of emotion. Both traceable to their early 1900s, and persisting until today. One mind of thought takes a dimensional approach and could be traced back to one of the first psychologists, Wilhelm Wundt. Wundt proposed that certain dimensions formed a basic elements that contributed a more specific emotions such as happiness and sadness. These dimensions included the dimensions of valence running from bad to good and arousal running from low to high, Wundt’s prediction was supported by more than a century of research showing that if you ask people, how they feel in many different ways and look at how these descriptions go together. 

00:06:05
And I’ve never lost a student. 

00:06:05
"Affect" Arousal valence Enthusiastic Tired Fearful 

00:06:10
BRIAN KNUTSON These two dimensions together usually give a good picture of person's current emotional state also known as his or her affect. These dimensions are independent. For example, if you say you feel excited, I can predict that you'll feel enthusiastic and not tired, but I can’t predict how fearful your feel. 

00:06:30
BRIAN KNUTSON Neuroscientists are now beginning to rediscover the importance of these dimensions when they measure how people feel as they anticipate gains or loses as we’ll discuss later. 

00:06:40
BRIAN KNUTSON Another complementary scheme traceable to biologist Charles Darwin, invokes categories rather than dimensions. This scheme is based on Darwin’s delightful and comprehensive descriptions of emotional expressions, mostly facial in humans and another animals. Darwin believed that emotional expressions signaled states that had survival value for the expresser and further that some of these states showed continuity across animals and humans. This categorical scheme entered a renaissance in the early 1970s when Paul Ekman tested whether a New Guinea tribesman could recognize the facial expressions of westerners, who they had never encountered before. Overturning that then prevalent view that emotions are culturally determined. Based on these discreet facial expressions, Ekman and another investigators proposed a number of basic emotional categories including happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust. While the dimensional and categorical schemes might seem distinct, they're also complementary. If we think about affective dimensions underlying emotional categories, we can overlay the two schemes. The dimensions to a reasonable job separating out different emotional categories, although there are some overlap that requires additional concepts to explain like the difference between anger and fear. According to both schemes, emotional experience were not always directly visible can generate coordinated changes in output. These can include physiological changes, changes in expressions and changes in more voluntary behavior including self-report. 

00:08:35
No, I'm trusting you. 

00:08:35
Are you sure. 

00:08:35
You can do. 

00:08:40
Yeah. 

00:08:40
Why are emotions? Rene Descartes 

00:08:45
BRIAN KNUTSON Assuming emotions exist, now we can measure their output. Why we've them to begin with. Western culture has a long history of ambivalence about the usefulness of emotions. For example, Plato described the soul as a chariot, being pulled by conflicting forces of reason and passion. Later Descartes, a pioneer of the scientific method place the mind in the soul, but emotion in the body, which reflected his suspicions about the lesser importance and greater fallibility of emotions. For a different view, consider Darwin’s intuition that animals and humans have emotions for a reason. Consistent with natural and sexual selection, emotions may help us both to survive and to pass our genes on to future generations. Our body seem prepare to respond to situations that assured survival on the very distant past such as startle when we're suddenly touched and feeling pleasure when encountering a smiling attractive fellow being. Because these circuits in animals and even in humans you can’t yet speak. Emotional experience may not require conscious reflection. Although we and other animals can prepare to experience emotions from birth, emotions are not fixed, emotions are incredibly flexible and may drive learning and behavior. 

00:10:10
Oh good go… 

00:10:10
BRIAN KNUTSON So far, we’ve learned that emotions bridge input and output by producing subjective evaluated reactions, they coordinate and channel behavior. The bridge analogy is not just the figure of speech, it can be taken literally as networks of neurons interact. But which brain circuits are necessary for generating emotional responses. Theorists have pondered this question for at least a century. For instance, both Wudnt and Darwin suspected that brain circuits generated emotional responses, but the most recent advances have come from technological innovations that allows to appear deep inside the working brain. 

00:10:55
Where are emotions? William James Walter Cannon 

00:11:00
BRIAN KNUTSON Around the same time, that Wudnt and Darwin wrote about emotion, William James and others speculated that emotions were caused by physiological reactions of the body, the gut in particular, but the brain interpreted emotionally, Physiologist Walter Cannon” refuted James’s theory in a number of ways, such as observing that the bodies reactions to events were too slow, too undifferentiated and ultimately not necessary for generating emotional experience, instead he pointed to the role of brain circuits as the critical generators of the emotional experience. 

00:11:35
BRIAN KNUTSON Although this debate continues in various forms of the present day, Cannon’s notion that certain brain regions were essential to emotions, inspired subsequent theories. His research also foreshadowed the importance of using neuroscience methods including lesions and stimulation in animals to establish that a specific brain region played a critical role in emotional experience. The brain is composed of many structures. For instance, the outside of the brain is called the cortex. 

00:12:05
cortex subcortical "reasoning" Triune brain brainstem hypothalamus striatum nucleus accumbens FIGHTING, FLEEING, FEEDING, FORNICATION reptilian amygdalae, anterior cingulate cortex, and the insular cortex “old mammalian” 

00:12:05
BRIAN KNUTSON The structures under the cortex deeper in the brain are referred to as subcortical. While regions to the cortex are associated with cognition some subcortical areas may prove most crucial to our understanding of the anatomy of emotions. Building on the work of Cannon and others, neuroanatomist Paul D. MacLean proposed a three part or triune scheme, associating deeper brain structures with earlier evolutionary functions. Deepest in the sub-cortex lie the structures of the brainstem, hypothalamus and striatum including the nucleus accumbens. Then MacLean suggested were associated with survival functions. These functions are jokingly referred to as the four Fs, fighting, fleeing, feeding, and fornication. MacLean called this part of the brain reptilian since he deemed at the most ancient in terms of evolution noting that all animals from reptiles to humans still rely up on these functions. Further up, it's still mostly subcortical, MacLean associated evolutionary more recent circuits with social emotions that focus on love and loss. These structures included the amygdalae, anterior cingulate cortex, and the insular cortex. He call these middle circuits old mammalian since we share these components with other mammals who like us must depend on others to survive and thrive. 

00:13:40
Was that good? You like it? 

00:13:45
You like it. 

00:13:45
"new mammalian" 

00:13:50
BRIAN KNUTSON Finally, at the top and in cortical regions, MacLean associated the evolutionarily most recent new mammalian circuits with symbolic and abstract representation including thinking about the future and the past, abilities basic to cognition, which are most highly developed in humans. 

00:14:05
Right now, I’m deciding between statistics and culture anthropology. 

00:14:10
Oh, I took culture anthropology that was great you should try to (inaudible ) your schedule. 

00:14:16
Okay, definitely I'll try to get that in. 

00:14:16
BRIAN KNUTSON These cognitive capacities depend on the functions of regions like the prefrontal cortex. Some parts of the prefrontal cortex, including the medial prefrontal regions may integrate affective information to help people make better decisions, although strict divisions between these three layers and components within each region have been debated. 

00:14:40
BRIAN KNUTSON The Triune brain scheme provides a useful way of associating different brain regions with emotional capacities. It suggests that subcortical regions are necessary for emotional experience, but does the evidence support this idea? 

00:14:50
Walter Hess hypothalamus striatumnucleus accumbens 

00:14:55
BRIAN KNUTSON For the last century, scientist have experimented with research animals to try to identify brain regions implicated in emotion. Lesioning(ph) has proven to be one of the most tools for establishing that a certain brain region plays a critical role in a given function. In the laboratory, leisioning(ph) entails physically or chemically disabling different brains structures of anesthetized animals, and then studying their behavior when their awake. Stimulation on the other hand usually involves delivering electricity or chemicals to distinct brain regions. An early researcher, he used electrical stimulation Walter Hess, won the noble prize after documenting that he could reliably evoke rage behaviors from cats by stimulating subcortical regions associated by MacLean with a reptilian brain. Shortly thereafter, James Olds and Peter Milner found that rats would worked vigorously to stimulate other subcortical brain regions near the lateral hypothalamus and ventral striatum including the nucleus accumbens. 

00:15:55
Jaak Pankseep 

00:15:55
BRIAN KNUTSON Even to the exclusion of other attractive activities like eating, drinking, having sex, and sleeping. On the basis of these initial and subsequent observations, Jaak Pankseep who coined the term affective neuroscience proposed that subcorticle circuit support various types of emotions including excitement, fear, anger and sadness. According to Pankseep, different circuits supported different emotional responses. The key players included a circuit running from the nucleus accumbens through the lateral hypothalamus to the midbrain for positive and aroused emotions like excitement. And a circuit running from the amygdalae through the medial hypothalamus to the midbrain for negative and aroused emotions like fear. With the prefrontal cortex helping to modify and guide activity in the subcortical circuits. 

00:17:00
When are emotions? 

00:17:05
BRIAN KNUTSON In addition to having different qualities, emotions have a dynamic aspect, rising and falling overtime. Although, this time scale can vary widely from seconds to days. For instance, we can be momentarily startled. 

00:17:15
Hey... 

00:17:15
Hey Sharine(ph) you are back... 

00:17:20
BRIAN KNUTSON Or have a predisposition... 

00:17:20
Good enough. I've.. I'm in a bit of hurry. 

00:17:25
BRIAN KNUTSON ...towards experiencing certain mood states. 

00:17:25
Well, its good to see you. 

00:17:25
Okay, Yeah. 

00:17:30
BRIAN KNUTSON The researchers typically think of emotions is changing on a second to second basis. Often in response to something in the environment. What minimal ingredients are necessary for an emotional episode unfold... New methods developed at the end of the 20th century, now allow investigators to visualize changes in the activity of small sub cortical regions in humans and animals on a second to second basis. Using these methods, investigators have established, not only that emotions occur in response to events known as reactive emotions. But also before or an anticipation of events proactive emotions. Two of Pankseep’s primary emotions excitement and fear... 

00:18:15
FEAR EXCITEMENT 

00:18:15
BRIAN KNUTSON ...often occurred during anticipation of some potential emotional outcome. We will call these proactive emotions “anticipatory affect”. 

00:18:25
FEAR EXCITEMENT "anticipatory affect" “negative arousal” ”positive arousal” 

00:18:25
BRIAN KNUTSON While both excitement and fear involve high arousal. Excitement involves a positive form of arousal. Whereas fear involves a negative form of arousal. Thus we’ll refer to these two primary types of anticipatory affect has “positive arousal” and “negative arousal”. 

00:18:45
Come on sit.. Wait... 

00:18:50
BRIAN KNUTSON Functionally, positive arousal might promote approach towards opportunities. While negative arousal might promote avoidance of threats. 

00:18:55
leave that can Carolyn(ph), come on.. Oh Carolyn(ph) 

00:19:00
BRIAN KNUTSON One of the most promising recent developments involves research suggesting that anticipatory affect correlates with activity in specific subcortical circuits in both humans and other animals. First, let’s consider negative arousal and next positive arousal. 

00:19:15
amygdalae 

00:19:20
BRIAN KNUTSON The amygdalae are small almond shaped sub cortical structures that lie deep within the temporal lobes of humans and other mammals. At about the same time that has stimulated the brains of cats to evoke emotional behavior. Scientists discovered that lesioning the sub cortical regions including the amygdalae caused animals to become tame and exploratory. Almost as if they lacked fear. Further amygdalae lesions prevent rats from showing fearful behaviors to cues for punishment such as noises that signal an out coming punishments such as the shock. 

00:19:55
BRIAN KNUTSON Because rats normally learn to respond rapidly to punishment cues researcher Joseph Ledoux thought there might be a direct and fast connection that ran directly from the ear to the amygdalae that could bypass a slower connection that ran through the cortex. In an elegant set of experiments, they do found evidence that supported his claim. 

00:20:20
BRIAN KNUTSON Even without a cortex, rats can learn to show fear responses to noises and signal of shock. But without an amygdalae, they could not. They do called this fast but imprecise subcortical connection that bypasses the cortex, the “low road”. As opposed to the slower but more sophisticated high road connection that includes the cortex. 

00:20:45
the "low road" thalamus auditory cortex amygdalae the "high road" 

00:20:50
BRIAN KNUTSON They do compare the low and high roads in the scenario when you encounter a long and squirrely(ph) form on a dark path. Initially, you may be quelled your heart rate may increase, your palms may get clammy. 

00:21:00
"low road" thalamus amygdalae 

00:21:05
BRIAN KNUTSON At this time activity in the low road may predominate. 

00:21:10
BRIAN KNUTSON I had this exact response not long ago on a trail not far from here to a very live and real rattlesnake. But more often than not on closer inspection, you realize that the form is not a snake but actually just a stick. In this case, we may proceed although more cautiously than before. 

00:21:25
"low road" thalamus amygdalae "high road" visual cortex thalamus amygdalae 

00:21:30
BRIAN KNUTSON At this point, the brain has engaged the high road for more complex but slower processing. 

00:21:35
BRIAN KNUTSON The fact that cortical input is not necessary for learning fear responses, suggest that people may learn fear subconsciously. 

00:21:40
Initial learning amygdala insula Well learned amygdala insula cue shock 

00:21:45
BRIAN KNUTSON However, even animals and humans without amygdalae can react negatively to punishment once it occurs. Neuroimaging studies of healthy human suggest that when they learn that a cue signals of punishment, amygdala activation initially increases. As does activity in a connected region called the insular cortex. However, while amygdala activation returns to baseline after people have learned that a cue signals of shock, activation in the insular cortex continues to increase in response to the shock cue. These findings suggest that beyond the amygdala, brain regions like the insulae are also important for anticipating negative events. 

00:22:25
Hey... How is it going? 

00:22:25
BRIAN KNUTSON The involvement of these regions in fear learning may have implications for diagnosing and treating some clinical disorders. Since patients with anxiety disorders tend to show more activation in the amygdala and the insular cortex when viewing emotional pictures. 

00:22:40
FEAR 

00:22:45
BRIAN KNUTSON While fear represents a form of negative arousal that can help us move away from threats. Emotional states such as excitement and enthusiasm represent forms of positive arousal that may move us towards opportunities. With respect to positive arousal, animal research again provided key starting points. Remember Olds and Milner's observation, the rats were work to stimulates sub cortical regions like the nucleus accumbens, even at the expense of obtaining other rewards. The neural transmitter Dopamine is released in this region. And rats will work just is hard to self administered Dopamine there as they will to self administered electrical stimulation. More over, rats brains naturally released Dopamine in the nucleus accumbens when they encounter a word cues for either food or drugs. And that Dopamine are always unconditionally elicits behavior associated with positive arousal including excited vocalizations and approach behavior. These observations suggest that some abused drugs may hijack or reward circuits leading individuals to expect increasingly rewarding payoffs that they never receive. Indeed, human neural imaging studies suggest not only that anticipation of pleasant tastes and sights but also anticipation of abstract rewards like money can increase activity in the nucleus accumbens. 

00:24:20
BRIAN KNUTSON In fact, money can provide a useful experimental tool because most people will work for money and its easy to manipulate various aspects of money such as the amount where the probability with which you might gain or lose it. In addition, most people tend to get emotional about monitory outcomes both before and after they occur. 

00:24:40
Choose... Stock T+$10.00 Bond C+$1.00 Stock S-$10.00 

00:24:40
BRIAN KNUTSON Using task involving anticipated monitory gain or loss, researchers including our laboratory have found that nucleus accumbens activation increases as people anticipate gaining more money. Even controlling for the amount of anticipated gain, nucleus accumbens activation is greater and individuals who are more excited about making some money. And then those who aren’t as excited. Suggesting a role for the nucleus accumbens in positive arousal. As with the amygdala and negative arousal, these findings may have clinical implications, schizophrenics sometimes suffer from a lack of positive arousal. And researchers have found that schizophrenics who report less positive arousal also show blunted nucleus accumbens activation while anticipating monitory gain. Further, new medications with less pronounced effects on Dopamine can normalize this deficit. 

00:25:35
BRIAN KNUTSON But beyond psychiatric symptoms to these findings have any implications for everyday behavior, specifically, if we can visualize brain activity related to anticipatory affect, can we use it to predict what people are about to do? 

00:25:50
BRIAN KNUTSON The ability to measure brain activity, seconds before people make a decision raises the possibility that researchers might be able to use brain activity to predict what people would choose next. One common decision involves whether to buy something or not. On the one hand, people want to buy things they like, representing a gain. An exposure to these things might increase activation in the nucleus accumbens. On the other hand, a given item might cost too much representing a loss. Which could increase activation in the amygdala or the insulae. In fact, when people decide whether or not to buy things while being scanned, nucleus accumbens activation increases when people see products they like. But insular activation increases when they see prices that are too high. 

00:26:45
BRIAN KNUTSON By simply observing nucleus accumbens activation in response to products and insular activation in response to prices, we can predict whether an individual being more or less likely to buy something seconds later. An example of anticipatory affect in action, further the pre-frontal cortex may balance these evaluations by weighing costs against benefits. But what about more sophisticated decisions like investing. 

00:27:10
BRIAN KNUTSON Economic theorist have argued that optimal investors should use calculations to choose the best options. Perhaps depending on cortical regions instead of more emotional subcortical regions. But do people really make investment decisions only by using math alone or might they also fall back on anticipatory affect for guidance. The riskiest investments involve both large possible gains and large possible loses. 

00:27:40
BRIAN KNUTSON Holding everything else equal, taking a financial risk may depend upon, how much positive arousal people feel about potential gains versus how much negative arousal, they feel about potential losses. 

00:27:55
BRIAN KNUTSON Indeed, neuroimaging studies suggest that as people consider risky investments, if they show increased nucleus accumbens activation, they are more likely to take a financial risk. Or as if they show increased insular activation, they’re more likely to avoid taking that same risk. 

00:28:15
[sil.] 

00:28:20
BRIAN KNUTSON So even for the most sophisticated decisions that require abstract reason and computation, people also use emotion. One can imagine that anticipatory affect also plays a role in other risky decisions. 

00:28:35
BRIAN KNUTSON Consider for instance for example of sky diving. Even after signing up, paying the fee and completing the training. 

00:28:45
I'm not sure this was the good idea. 

00:28:45
BRIAN KNUTSON When standing at the door of the airplane at several thousand feet a balance of positive arousal and negative arousal may determine whether a person ultimately jumps or not provided one has a choice in the matter. 

00:29:05
Implications 

00:29:05
BRIAN KNUTSON As we round out our brief tour with affective neuroscience, its important to stress that in humans the study of emotional brain circuits has just begun. 

00:29:15
BRIAN KNUTSON Discoveries and progress in this room will continue to depend on an advances in our tools and technological capabilities. But early indication suggest that the study of affective neuroscience holds promise for real world applications. 

00:29:30
BRIAN KNUTSON Presently, of course we have more questions then answers. How does that brain support other emotional experiences both basic and complex? To what extend, are we aware of and how much control can we observe over our emotional experiences? What are the limits of emotional influence on decisions and can emotions promote as well as derail decisions. 

00:29:55
BRIAN KNUTSON Even though we’re at a very early stage affective neuroscience research has began to provide answers to simple yet profound questions about the nature of emotion experience. 

00:30:05
BRIAN KNUTSON What are emotions? 

00:30:10
BRIAN KNUTSON Hey... 

00:30:10
BRIAN KNUTSON That was awesome... 

00:30:10
BRIAN KNUTSON Alright. 

00:30:15
BRIAN KNUTSON Bye... 

00:30:15
BRIAN KNUTSON Programs that connect different perceptual input with coordinated motoric output and minimally involve elements of subjective evaluation and arousal. Why do we have emotions? To facilitate our survival and continuation, at least in the ancestral past. Where are emotions? Although the cortex that provides more measured responses to events can modify emotional reactions, critical circuits also reside in more evolutionarily ancient, subcortical brain regions. When do emotions occur? Emotions can change dynamically on the order of seconds, not only in response to events but also in anticipation of those events. In a way that can organize and guide future behavior. 

00:31:10
BRIAN KNUTSON Thanks for joining me on our short tour. Hope you enjoyed it and we’ll continue to explore and perhaps contribute to the development of affective neuroscience in the years to come.
