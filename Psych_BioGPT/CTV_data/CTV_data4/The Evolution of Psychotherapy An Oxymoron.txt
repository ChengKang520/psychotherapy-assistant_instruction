The Evolution of Psychotherapy: An Oxymoron Scott D. Miller International Center for Clinical Excellence 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:00:00
 I'm sure the, the rest of you are as eager as I am to hear what Scott's gonna have say about this. Ah, especially, ah, seeing as how, ah, he is the man with the finger on the pulse of psychotherapy, ah, from a global and international prospective. So, will you please, ah, join me in welcoming Dr. Scott Miller. 

00:00:20
DR. SCOTT MILLER Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much for that I am Scott and I'm pleased to be with you all. Uhm, here in Anaheim today, to talk about this topic, uhm, I am the director of the International Center for Clinical Excellence. Uhm, with that-- this organizational is actually launched, uhm, right here in 2009 at the Evolution of Psychotherapy Conference and in the last uhm, four years, ah, he's grown into the largest web-based organization of mental health professionals in the world. Thousands of clinicians, practitioners, educators and researchers meet daily, ah, to learn from one another. And I really do hope that you will join us in the conversation, it's free, they are no cost, they are no secret hidden levels supreme in content. Uhm, and it's also add free so you're not going to get bombarded with ads for books or purchasing videos etcetera. And in many ways, this topic of excellence is related to what I'd like to talk about in this particular address. Uhm, all that I do talk about everything I cover you can find on my website which is its ScottDMiller.com. If you are tweeting from this particular presentation and, and I hope you will. Make sure you put the hash tag, ah, EVO, E-V-O 2013 and also the ICCE, it's twitter account name at the ICCE, uhm, during process.

00:01:55
DR. SCOTT MILLER So, here we are, uhm, 2013 nearly three decade since the first Evolution Conference, the stated purpose of which was to track the development in our field. Evolution is defined as the gradual development of something especially from a simple to a more complex form. Progress defined as forward movement. Well, have we evolved them? In order to answer that question, uhm, I would like to have us all enter a time machine and go backwards about 30 years to the sixth living today, Anaheim the sixth Evolution Conference and going all the way back to 1985. Where you there? Cool, I was there too, I was a young second year a grad student in psychology. I filled out my papers and was so excited, ah, to be there. And to serve as a volunteer to wear a red hat. Uhm, so grateful to be able to meet many of the folks that I was studying and hoping to learn from and certainly wanted to immolate. Many of my heroes were there, uhm, I listen and met both Carl Rogers and Virginia Satir. I have to tell you they were every bit as great as it they seem today. I was in the room when R. D. Laing interviewed a young psychotic woman. Ah, the interview was confusing and intriguing at the same time. And I listen as Bruno Bettelheim commented on his speech. Criticizing the work that R.D. Laing had done to which R.D. when ask to respond simply lean forward to the microphone and cried. I thought it was a perfect response to being beat up by a smart guy. I saw the test, they debate between Masterson and Haley, the time when Haley was saying psycho and analysis was dead. And Masterson replied, "Mr. Haley." and then stop and said, "It is Mr. Right not doctor." It's a fantastic, you're looking for that shit to happen when you come to a thing like this. I even sat stunned maybe you were there when Ernest Rossi disrobe in front of the entire audience. Thousands of people watch him strip down to his underwear. He was demonstrating what it took to have a memorable impact on people. I, I have to tell you I remember it to this day although. I can't remember what a thing of what he said after that. It was a heady experience one that left me feeling excited about the future and anticipating the developments to come. 

00:05:05
The Evolution of Psychotherapy: So, what's happened? •Since 1960's: •Number of treatment approaches grown from 60 to 400+; •10 000+ "how to" books published on psychotherapy; •145 manualized treatments for 51 of the 297 possible diagnostic groups in DSM. The Evolution of Psychotherapy: Progress •In most studies of treatment conducted over the last 40 years, the average treated person is better off than 80% of the untreated sample. •The outcome of behavioral health services equals and, in most cases, exceeds medical treatments. •On average, mental health professionals achieve outcomes on par with success rates obtained in randomized clinical trials (with and without co-morbidity). No Improvement 

00:05:05
DR. SCOTT MILLER So, what's happened? Have we evolved over the last 30 years? Well, the number models has certainly increased, the number of treatment approaches from 60 to over 400. There been thousands of books published telling us all how to do therapy and do it better. And there are more diagnostic specific treatment approaches, lists and manuals supposedly teaching us what we need to know to be more effective. The problem with all of this is that if you look at the research literature dating back all the way to the mid '70s and all the way forward to the present year 2013. There has been really some good news, that good news is that most studies indicate that what we do works. Average treaty client better often 80% of the untreated sample. If you seen me speak before the conference you know that the outcome of behavioral health services rivals and in most cases exceeds medical treatments. And on average we mental health professionals average folks working in our offices everyday trying to help people. We achieve outcomes that are on par with those obtained in tightly controlled randomized clinical trials. In other words, the outcomes are good that's the good news. The bad news is, there has been no improvement in treatment outcome over that same time period. None, zero, zip, nada, we've tried desperately to get better but the outcomes are not getting better, 1976 just take a moment and think back if you were even there in 1976. Think of the clothes you were wearing. How you dialed your phone. No desktop computers, your car that you were driving and your hairstyle. You still look that same way in 2013, still wearing those same clothes, still having those same outcomes. So, if the question is have we evolved? I guess you would have to say we've definitely evolved. We have moved from simple to more complex forms. This conference is a testament to the complexity of the work, if you listen and move from room to room, you hear just how difficult this all is. Sorting it out, what to do, once you leave even more complicated. The lack of improvement in our outcomes I'm hoping will force us to ask, maybe we have evolved, but have we progressed? The answer to this question I think is, less satisfying. 

00:07:50
The Evolution of Psychotherapy: Progress: •The effectiveness of the "average" helper plateaus very early. •Little or no difference in outcome between professionals, students and para-professionals. The Evolution of Psychotherapy: Progress? •Practitioners incomes in serious decline; •Factoring inflation, therapists earning one-third of what they did 10-15 years ago. •Increasingly direct services provided by minimally -trained support personnel. •Use of psychotherapy declined by 35%; •Use of pharmaceuticals increased by 75% 

00:07:50
DR. SCOTT MILLER And there is other research. That other research indicates that the effectiveness of the average clinician, that's guys like me people like you. Plateau very early in their career. I mentioned on Wednesday how early that is that clinicians actually begin to plateau. It's about 50 hours of direct service. Fifty hours of direct service and you have achieve your life's pursuit of an effective therapist. There is even more troubling findings and that is that there's little or no difference in outcome between professionals, students and minimally trained para-professionals. Now, don't kill me I'm only the messenger. But it should quite a concern to all of us that despite all of our hard work, we're just not achieving better outcomes. And it's not only that-- its not that were outcomes have remained flat but I would argue that in fact our profession has been losing ground actually. When you look at what's happening to average therapist practicing especially in the United States but elsewhere that I travel, you have to know that self-- therapist incomes are in serious decline. Factoring in inflation. The therapist are earning one-third of what they earned 10-15 years ago. Increasingly direct services are provided by minimally-trained support personnel. It's a drug when you think about it. And that's not all the bad news. 

00:09:25
 More bad news. 

00:09:25
The Evolution of Psychotherapy: Progress? •Use of psychotherapy declined by 35%; •Use of pharmaceuticals increased by 75%. The Evolution of Psychotherapy: Progress? Ex•tinc•tion /ik'stiNG(k)SHən/ Noun The state or process of a species, family, or larger group being or becoming extinct. Synonyms: dying out, disappearance, vanishing The Evolution of Psychotherapy: •Theories •Diagnosis •Methods and Models 

00:09:30
DR. SCOTT MILLER Here's the other bad news. Use of psychotherapy during that same time indicates that we are in a steep decline. In the last decade, use of psychotherapy has declined by 35% at the same time, use the pharmaceuticals have increased by 75%. It's not that our customers don't want to improve their lives. It's simply their choosing other options, that have perhaps easier less time consuming, etcetera. Given this findings, can we really conclude that we're making progress? No, approachable improvement in our outcomes, in a 37-year period? Average clinicians do not improve over time. And they achieve outcomes on par with success rates obtained by minimally-trained para-professionals. Not to mention our incomes etcetera. You have to wonder is this the definition of progress or is this the definition of something else? I would say, maybe it's the definition of extinction. The state or the process of a species or family, or a larger group becoming extinct dying out, disappearing. You know, when I talk to therapist about this, this whole phenomenon that's happening in our field, I hear a lot of ideas about what might be happening and it's usually no surprise when I built-- bring up our incomes etcetera the difficulty, our field is having in making advances as compared to medicine. And I say why do you think this is? And here's what I hear. Well, I hear how can you compete with big pharma? Insurance companies have cut as off at the knees. Society is more complex, the problems are more difficult. Hey, some say, the field is good enough, people that we treat now they just wanna quick fix. Some say to me, "Hey, Scott I like what you said and the way you say it." But the researchers just wrong. We are more effective. Well, I think we can propose an analogy here. And the analogy might be to the dodo. The dodo bird now extinct. The bird was about a meter tall and weighed about 10 to 20 kilos. It had no natural predators. And although few humans actually consider the dodo bird tasty. It was easily hunted by humans because it couldn't fly. Within 200 years of contact with our species around 1693, on the isle of Mauritius in Indian Ocean, it was gone nevermore. Now, humans who hunted the bird to extinction without mercy or foresight. You know, we have to take some credit for their extinction. Some of the blame we were one of it, if not the primary causes of their demise. At the same time, their inability to fly contributed to the problem. In evolutionary terms, flight is a very costly adaptation. Birds have some of the highest metabolic rates walking consumes much less energy. And without any natural predators you have to ask yourself why do it? Why fly? And so overtime, it stopped flying and it decided why build our nest high-up in the tree or on the cliff where our chicks could fall out, where we had to fly up there to feed them. When they can built-- be built just the same on the ground. And with no natural predators, it was a reasonable development. Then circumstances changed, humans moved in and I'm proposing that in our field circumstances have changed. In a parallel fashion, we gave up flight long ago. Being on our own was costly to us. And so we decided to connect with another brother field, the field of medicine. And we have through out most of our history focused in a medical kind of way on creating a psychological formulary. Methods believed to contain specific healing ingredients remedial to the condition being treated, the diagnosis we had to address or the underlying pathology to believe being if you didn't apply that specific method to that underlying pathological process, the client wouldn't be healed. It seem like a very reasonable adaptation to give up our own professional identity and link to field of psychotherapy with medicine. To hang out they were successful after all. But I'm going to say to you that I think it's time to admit, it's not worked out so well for us. Psychotherapy works there's no doubt. How can we expect to survive the changing practice environment by continuing with more of the same. You have to wonder, did the dodo birds ever think, "damn, we shouldn't have given up flight." Maybe not. We should be thinking, "damn, what do we need to do differently now?" If we don't stop doing more of the same, what are we going to do? Short of restoring flight, what can we do? Well, think about this for a second. Evolution we now occurs at the individual level. Now, for those of you who are expert in the field I know there are some controversy about individual versus group evolution. Just hang with me for a minute. Because I'm going to argue that we been studying the wrong thing. The Evolution of Psychotherapy, makes no sense to me. The field doesn't evolve by models it evolves because of you.

The Evolution of Psychotherapists: •Some therapists achieve consistently better results than others; •Differences between the therapists consistently accounts for 5-9% of variability in treatment outcome; •Differences persists when therapist competence is held constant and treatments are manualized; •Difference is unrelated to age, gender, caseload, theoretical orientation, social skills, professional degree, years of experience, and time spent conducting therapy. The Evolution of Psychotherapists: Richard Bandler & John Grinder Sol Garfield Michael Lambert David Ricks Lester Luborsky Don Meichenbaum David Orlinsky & Michael Ronnestad 

00:15:35
DR. SCOTT MILLER And we should be talking more about The Evolution of Psychotherapi-- Psychotherapists rather than psychotherapy. Who cares what happens to our models etcetera? What we should be ensuring is that each of us survived to reproduce other little therapist in the future. Evolution occurs at that individual level, the field could begin to focus on you, the therapist your evolution and your development. Here 's what we know from the research. And it's not a small amount of research it's decades and decades of research pointing of the same thing. But once again were running like the dodo having given up flight, lined up with medicine, thinking in the same way we've thought since our fields inception. Here's what the research says, "models don't do therapy, therapist do therapy." And some therapist achieve consistently better results than others. Let that sink in. Maybe we should be asking ourselves a different question instead of what model should I use? What do the better therapist do in our field to achieve those outcomes? After all on the isle of Mauritius the birds that can fly are still there. The dodo is gone, differences between therapist account for between five to 9% of the variability in treatment outcomes. Now, you may think that's not very much. Let me tell you it's enough variability to drive a truck through. It's huge and let me put it in perspective. It's five to nine times greater than the variability attributable to the treatment approach. So, maybe we should put us in focus. And of the differences between the best and the rest of us continue, they persist. I mean we researchers control for things like count-- competence. In other words, we make sure that the treatment are manualized when experts watching us work you can't tell the difference between the model being used. It's rated equally competent. And when they do that the differences between therapist persist, those differences are unrelated to age, gender, caseload, theoretical orientation, social skills, emotional intelligent, professional degree, years of experience or years, or time spent conducting therapy. I hope I'm making a strong argument that we need to look else-- elsewhere. When experts cannot tell the difference in quality between the outcome-- or between the treatment model being used and yet the treat-- the differences persist maybe it's not about to the model, maybe it's about something else that unique quality of that particular provider. Now, I'm not the first to make this argument there are have been many that have come before me. Starting all the way back with Lester Luborsky in the 1950s. He wrote a chapter, ah, about the qualities of effective therapist. It was brilliant work not a single person picked up on it after he started to creating this list. Until much later when Don Meichenbaum created his list of qualities of master therapist. One of the first people to do quantitative study about master therapist and their sup-- the qualities of superior therapist was a psychologist by the name David F. Ricks. I don't have a picture of David Ricks there isn't one any place to be found. But David F. Ricks did a study in 1974, about the time we started measuring treatment outcomes. Nineteen-seventy four David followed up with adults who'd been treated as children in the New York State Mental Health Care System. He yoked the clients looking-- in other words, comparing clients that were equally severe in their presenting problems and complaints. And what if he wanted to find out was why did some of these adults treated the children? Why were they surviving and thriving? Why were they living good lives while others were in jail, in prison, on welfare or dead. What was the difference? Can you guess what he found? Who treated them? That was the difference, if they've been treated by these therapist they were doing well. If they were treated by that one they were much more likely to be among the unsuccessfully treated clients. Nineteen-seventy four is when the study took place. It's a fairly scary finding when you think about it. I guess that's why not a single person look at his research for 30 more years. It's the third rail of our profession that what really matter is not your model but you. That you make the critical difference in your clients lives not the model that you happened to practice. As I said before that's when Mike Lambert picked up this, ah, along with colleagues David Vermitt-- Ver-- Vermeersch and Okiishi and began measuring the outcomes of therapist and reported that-- in what David F. Ricks had found back in 1974 was true. Some clinicians were reliably better than others. Once again a few people picked up Michael's research. I should tell you one more thing about David F. Ricks, when he was doing his study which was called supershrinks, that particular study. He did not cling that term supershrinks and neither did I although we views it, ah, liberally in the articles we published. Actually it was one of the adult he interviewed told him that the kids at the institution had coined of the term about one of the psychologist there. And David said, ah, David was talking to this adult treated as child. And ask about this person, well, they said, we called him the supershrink and we actually began telling other kids make sure you avoid the other guy, because he's a real stinker. Don Meichenbaum created a list during the heyday of CBT, Sol Garfield wrote that remind in the field about the importance of examining the practitioner, he too was ignored. Bandler and Grinder of course wrote their series, ah, the structure of magic where they were basing it on this, ah, people master therapist who we all believed were quite effective. Now, there was one problem about all of this research with one exception and that's Lambert state up. None of the studies, none of the studies that look at this phenomenon with the exceptions of Lambert and David F. Ricks. Provided concrete evidence of what top performing clinicians actually did. How they achieve their results nor proof, that they were actually more effective. Instead for example, in the list created by Luborsky and Don Meichenbaum, you were voted to be a master therapist by your peers. This has nothing to do with outcome and all to do with reputation and the two things may not go together in any reliable way. Finally, there was a long-term study, ah, by two of my heroes Michael Ronnestad from Norway and David Orlinsky at the University of Chicago. They did and a 20 years study of a 11,000 therapist looking at their professional development and here's what they found, quite striking. Without exception, therapist see themselves as developing over their careers. The problem with Ronnestad and Orlinsky study is there was no proof we actually developed. Plus, if you look at other data it turns out that we therapist over estimate our effectiveness routinely. We see ourselves in a kind of Lake Wobegon way. Believing that we are more effective than we are, the average therapist think about this believes that they are more effective than 80% of their peers. Now, you may object and say but isn't that true of a lot of professions and I say, "Yes, does that make you feel better?" It is true by the way would you like to know the profession that most vastly over estimates. It's competence in relationship to its peers. Would you like to know? College professors. The average college professor believes that they are better, smarter than 90% of their peers. I guess that's why they have office hours. Well, our team struggled for a long time because we actually had been measuring outcomes for nearly a decade. And we did find like Lambert that some therapist were better than others but we were completely lost as to how to understand this until run across a Swedish researcher by the name K. Anders Ericsson. 

00:24:35
The Evolution of Psychotherapists: •Studied experts in chess, music, art, science, medicine, mathematics, history, computer programming. THE CAMBRIDGE HANDBOOK OF Expertise and Expert Performance The Evolution Expertise: How Top Therapists Improve? The Streetlight Effect 2013 Anaheim The Evolution of Psychotherapy: The Streetlight Effect Method Diagnosis Therapy The Evolution of Psychotherapy: The Streetlight Effect ↓BEFORE T ↓AFTER 

00:24:35
DR. SCOTT MILLER K. Anders Ericsson is written as fabulous, massive tone called The Cambridge Handbook of Expertise and Expert Performance. He studied experts in chess, music, arts, science, medicine, mathematics, history, computer programming, and what he found was quite interesting. He found that the process that led to the development of expertise across these different domains was largely the same, not different. We had to get outside our box however in order to figure that out. So, we have decided that many of us suffered from the Streetlight phenomenon. You may have heard this, if you work the first evolution conference and listen to Paul Watzlawick, he told the story. You've heard it, there's a man, ah, that is looking who is looking around underneath the streetlight, the police officer happens by and says, "What are doing?" He says, "I'm looking for keys." And the police officer says, "Well, did you lose them here?" He says, "No I lost them over there." And the policeman says, "Why are you looking here?" He says, "The light is better, here, the light is better." And we were doing the same thing with psychotherapy we were stuck in-- with the streetlight phenomenon. I think our field in many ways is stuck looking in the most obvious place for where the effectiveness of treatment happens. We've assumed that we have to look where the li-- bri-- light is brightest. We interviewed therapist, we watch videos of them at work. We studied their demographics, their age, their gender, their experience, their approach. Statistically, we controlled for sovereignty to ensure that those who were measurably better were actually better and not because they were simply working with easier and less challenging clients. And what did we find? Nothing, we found nothing. I can't tell you how many mind that-- I mean, nauseatingly boring videos of expert therapist I watch. Trying to find out what the hell were they doing in there? Plus half the time I watched it and thought this is shit. It doesn't been look good it's disorganized, they stop and start, they act confused maybe being disorganized is the key to being an effective therapist. The point here is we studied everything that was lit aptly, lit brightly. To stuff inside the box, the method, the diagnosis, the therapist, the client, their interpersonal interaction. Ericsson's discovery was quite different. He said that what separates the best and the rest was not necessarily what occurs in the box. One should achieved a reliable average of performance that won't make you any better trying to redo what you already do. Instead he said, what separates the best from the rest is what they do before and after their sessions. How they spent their time something that Ericsson called deliberate practice. 

00:27:50
Deliberate Practice De·lib·er·ate /di'libərit/ Adjective Done consciously and intentionally. Prac·tice /'praktəs/ Noun To carry out a particular activity regularly. Hours per week spent alone seriously engaging in activities related to improving therapy skills Hours/Week 0 2 4 6 8 Top 3rd 2nd 1st ∎Hours 14X The Evolution of Expertise: How Top Therapists Improve? AS WELL AS PIANO CHESS SURGERY RADIOGRAPHY TEACHING PROGRAMMING SOCCER TENNIS SINGING.... Deliberate Practice 

00:27:50
DR. SCOTT MILLER When we broke therapist-- when we broke the outcomes of therapist in, in our research into quartiles, uhm, we found that certain therapist emerged if they did this deliberate practice is more affected. Deliberate, what does it mean? Conscious and intentionally. Practice, caring out a particular activity, ah, repetitiously and regularly. And how does it look when you look at therapist outcomes? This is from the only study in the treatment literature to current time. Deliberate practice is the hours you spend alone, seriously engaging in activities designed to improve your therapeutic skills. Not what you did in the room but what you did before and after you left your room or came to that room. And if you look at the top performing therapist in our study, they spent 14 times more hours outside a practice, something we call practice outside of practice. Deliberately practicing, practicing alone trying to improve their skills. Now, Ericsson had already been here. We just didn't know it. We were too busy looking where the light was bright. But Ericsson have been researching for example violinist. Uhm, and how they acquire their skills. Take a look at this particular graphic, he'd also studied, uhm, ah, a piano, chess, surgery, radiography, teaching, programming and soccer etcetera. Then you maybe thinking-- you maybe thinking, well some of these thing surgery, there's a set procedure and a set skill very easy to measure. If you're thinking that psychotherapy is more like an art. I usually say, people dim things in art when weren't their for the millions strokes that were made to paint the picture. Then you think it's an art. You're saying the finish product. Ah, and radiography try thinking, try, ah, reading a radiographic film. This takes exceptional talent you'll often hear radiologist say, what an art form it is to be able to reliably improve your performance. So, take a look at this happens to be for violin players over the course of their careers and his broken I mean two-thirds. The-- at the beginning when they first start their first year of practice playing the violin, you can see that there's virtually no difference between the three groups. Over time each of the groups begins to separate in terms of their performance as judged by expert judges using standardized scales playing the violin. And by the way this graph is for violin's the graph looks the same whether its violin's, piano, chess, ah, or any of these other, ah, any of these other areas. So, as you can see by their fourth year they have spent nearly seven times more hours than the less proficient or bottom third violin players. It a shocking difference. Now, would you like to see therapist? There I'll try, did a, ah, an incredible job having therapist plot how they spent their time over the first 8 years of their career. And here's the graph, put them side by side, again broken in two-thirds that is the therapist at year eight of their practice with the best outcomes or the blue line. Thirty-five hundred hours of practice outside of practice by their eighth year. Compare that to the bottom third. The bottom third have spend 14 and a half less hours, ah, 14 and a half a times less hours a few hours of practicing outside of practice. Here's the cruel part, both get paid the same for their work. It's strange really, ah, that the our field continues this way. And just take a look again the graphs looks surprisingly similar to the work by Ericsson from other performance domains. We were no longer in the box as researchers searching in vain under street lamp. So, deliberate practice, what should you do if you want to deliberately practice? What should you do? How should you spend your time? This was the question we all wondered about, and we didn't realized that when we're asking ourse-- ourselves this question we were caught in the very medical model that we'd struggled to escape. As if there was something we could all each do that was the same that would push our outcomes into the top third, ah, performers. We created a massive inventory, had clinicians report in detail each week. How they spent their time? Looking for the thing the one thing we could all do. When it came back here's what we found, they simply spent more time doing it. Whatever that happen to be their seem to be two general kinds of things they work at. 

00:32:55
Deliberate Practice BASIC MISTAKES Deliberate Practice Edge of Ability Too Easy Too Difficult 

00:32:55
DR. SCOTT MILLER The first one was they spent a lot more time studying and re-studying the basics. It's very easy once you've mastered the basics to think you should move on to the advance stuff. What Ericsson found was that the best physicist actually spent time reading and re-reading basic papers in the field, basic text. When was the last the time you re-read Gerard Egan's to helping professional? Or Aquarius book on the helping relationship. This is where you should spend the part of your time outside of your practice. Engagement skills, core counseling process. The other thing they did was they spent a lot of time studying and identifying small process errors. Their failures to connect with this individual client. Why? Because the heirs aren't something that is ubiquitous across therapist. Their specific to your knowledge base. So, in order for you to get better, in order for you to evolve you have to figure out. What is it you don't do well. In order to find that out you have to look closely, you have to measure. For each practitioner, the specifics varied, uhm, they tended to work, ah, the top performers tended to work at the edge of their realm of reliable performance. Reliable performance, take a look at the graphic up here, the, the edge of your ability. Uhm, if you're down on the left-hand side its when its too easy, you don't really have to think, you can execute the process as quickly and automatically. Now, if you remember when you were a student for those of you who are already in the field, you can remember what it was like to struggle with the basics. Just to figure out what to say. Now, they're executed quickly and automatically. All you have to do is recognized, retrieve and then execute your action. Are you with me here? This stuff you don't have to think about which is why, you don't get better out of it. Because we're just doing it automatically. In order to-- from prove we have to find that zone of proximal development where your reliable performance is inconsistent, let me give you a hint about where you'll find that. The next time you describe your client as resistant or difficult that's your edge. Because your client isn't difficult its just you're not engaging that particular client in a useful activity, that's what I would practice right at that edge. You have to identify those errors and misperceptions. Sets more process and outcome objectives. What do I mean by that? Writing out specifically what you're going to try to do the next time you meet that particular client. Top performers don't wing it. They simply don't wing it. They push themselves to the edge and they consciously and deliberately plan for what they're going to do next. They plan, they rehearse and they reflect on their work. Now, if you're like me, when you are at the conference like this I spend most of my time listening to other professionals not in the too easy range realm of reliable performance. And not in the zone of proximal developments. I spend my time at this presentations in the ambit of admiration. The ambit of admiration is when you're watching this clinicians work and you think holy shit, I could never do this. And what happens when you're in the ambit of an-- admiration, the ability of these of, of others appear flawless, magical and dramatic. Let me just ask. Does anybody felt that way, yet, at the evolution conference? These things just gets spun magically and we are transfixed by it, hypnotized, I've got to learn that. Here's the truth you can't, you can't possibly learn to do what they did. Effort and attention get focused on easily recognized things but they are usually none casual factors and processes. We live with superstitious behavior, in other words, things that don't really lead to any difference and we risk, the risk of failure and injury is high. If you are in the ambit of admiration and you go home and try this stuff chances are you may do more harm than good. Why is that? Let me give you another story. Championship figure skaters. Anders Ericsson studied these folks in the last stu-- in the Turin-- 2006 Turin Olympics. He found-- he had them measure their time. How they spent their time on ice when they practiced? And they found that the top gold medal winners spent much more time practicing in the zone of proximal development. Whereas, bronze and, ah, lower, ah, spent more time performing the parts of the routine they did well. Am I making sense? Then, they were are few people who were injured and couldn't then go to the Olympics, where were they? They were doing stuff that was too far beyond their ability. Finding that sweet spot really requires caution, care and thought. Where do my reliably administered practices to begin to break down? That's what I need to study and work on, uhm, improving. Those top performing therapist measure on an ongoing basis. Our team provides measures that you can use. You can use the ORS and the SRS. Are they the measures on the planet? Absolutely not and I hope our field doesn't give enough fight about which measure we should be using, that I think would be silliness. Use the OQ, use the back depression inventory. What ever it is you use start using it regularly. After your therapy reflect, what was it that I didn't do up? Here's one another skill I talked about in the reach presentation, take a moment this conference and think about the last time you delivered the session where you were doing your level best. When you think it was a good representation of you doing your best work. Then, write a thick description of that session. Everything you said, the client did back and forth. Set that aside, let it be for a week. After a week take that description and after each session you have look at it and ask yourself, "How did I fall short of my best work today?" And keep a list of that, you're likely to get closer to your zone of proximal development. Again, lots of other areas where this is been shown.

The Evolution of Psychotherapy: Nat•u•ral Se•lec•tion /'naCHərəl/ /sə'lekSHən/ "The process whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive." Top Performing Clinicians: •Deliver more reliably effective treatment; •Achieve 50% better outcomes; •Suffer 50% fewer dropouts; •Provide more value per dollar spent. 

00:39:50
DR. SCOTT MILLER So, the best they deliver a more reliably effective and less variable treatment process. When we look at them and the work that they do, they also achieve 50% better outcomes than average performers. And we believe that what they do is applicable to all in our quest to evolve as a profession and as professionals. What do we need to do? Spend more time in deliberate practice each of us evolving one at a time focused on our errors. How can we help each other? Do it together. Work together and helping each other identify those errors and figure out what were going to do next. Thanks very much. 

00:40:40
[sil.] 

00:40:45
DR. SCOTT MILLER Thank you. I'd-- we do have a few minutes left if you would like to, ah ask questions I ask that you move to the microphone I'm more than willing to take those questions, uhm, and then we can I know adjourn for lunch. So, are if there are questions feel free to come on up. Yes. 

00:41:00
 Yes. My question it's on your group of top performers. 

00:41:05
DR. SCOTT MILLER Yes. 

00:41:05
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA EVO2013 

00:41:05
 I really see psychotherapists being in a completely different category for the one reason that we get trained, we go in a room, nobody sees what we do. So we don't get the on get it going feedback that all the other performers that you mention do get because they're public. So, one concern is, is that and then, the other concern with the deliberate practice which I fully agree with and fully would endorse is-- our, we sufficient of observers to understand the technology of what works and doesn't work in psychotherapy to be good, self observers to do that, that work. 

00:41:40
DR. SCOTT MILLER One of this-- both of these are great comments let me answer them in a unified way and that is in order to be able to see what our errors are you will have to measure. So, you are going to have to get feedback from the person whose always there when do psychotherapy, your client. That means using standardized form to find out are you making progress and if not what have do I need to do. Secondly, and probably and more importantly have I engaged you with whatever stuff I'm spending in the room. Whatever style I happen to do, that's one start. To do deliberate practice piece I couldn't agree with you more. You need to be watched by somebody whose skills, you admire and want to immolate. And whose outcomes are known. So, two pieces, now, also highlight one-third piece. What's in it for me because let's just admit money and time are scarce. And this is going to cost both in order to get better at your work and the chances are you won't get paid anymore. I'm asking you to think beyond that to the fields of evolution, we really need to move our outcomes to a different level. We can't stay the same, we need to reach people that are currently dropping out of care. Thank you. 

00:42:55
 Thanks for that. 

00:42:55
DR. SCOTT MILLER Yeah. Yes. 

00:42:55
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA EVO2013 

00:42:55
 Hi, uhm, you dedicated that the one where were looking at what differentiates experts that was, ah, time alone spent in practice. Is there-- is there an emphasis on alone there? 

00:43:10
DR. SCOTT MILLER There is the emphasis on alone outside of practice. And here's the reason, ah, you can't get better at therapy while you're doing therapy. And the reason is the key ingredient that needs to be there, it can't. You have to consciously reflect on your work. And when you're doing therapy and clients don't stop talking so you can think, they don't. So, you are relying on what know and what you can improvise at the moment which is really quite good, remember I said our outcomes are good. But if you want to get better it requires an additional step and that's the time to reflect. Not only just reflect but also plan and I'm talking about making a specific plan to improve in a very small area. If you do that then your outcomes will slowly move up. And I'm talking slowly. Don't expect any big giant movement in your practice because once you've made the Olympic trials the difference between the best and the rest are very small but make all the difference in the world. Yes. 

00:44:10
 Yes, ah, over here, I'm sorry. Yeah, here, yeah. Uhm, I'm interested in the interaction between the basics and the fundamentals that you talk about. 

00:44:20
DR. SCOTT MILLER Yes. 

00:44:20
 And the, ah, fascination with of-- is particularly usually comes from academia but even more so in terms of, uhm, insurance company as far as evidence-based practice, blah, blah, blah. Uhm, in terms of what is the new flavor of the model of the month is, you know, that now some researchers come out to know and I know this an academia, it's like they don't-- let's just discourage Satir and so on so forth because there wasn't enough research there and we want-- and here's the most recent researching and the like. Uhm, and then also once own, ah, natural curiosity as a therapist in terms of how is it that I could do something different here that could be more effective. This-- could you talk about the, the three-- interplay those three the fundamentals versus the fascination with novelty versus the fast-- ever and recent research and once own natural curiosity that is trying to learn more. 

00:45:15
DR. SCOTT MILLER I think it would be good to deliberately practice all of those things especially if your, ah, measurement of your work shows you to be lacking with that client. 

00:45:25
 Uh-uh. Yeah. 

00:45:25
DR. SCOTT MILLER But it that to talk about them generally and abstractly I think this is the problem. 

00:45:30
 I see. 

00:45:30
DR. SCOTT MILLER The problem is that most of these very general cognitive kind of, uhm, ah, themes, paradigms, methods, their, their far to decontextualized to make any difference to that individual or client. The experts I like-- I like to say when I talk somebody like Wendy who I showed on Wednesday whose this top performing clinician. If you say to Wendy something like well, uhm, how do you work with the depressed person? Wendy will look at you with the-- with the dumbfounded look on her face, she does even know how to start the question or start the answer but she'll say, "Hi, hello this is person? Is it a male or a female? Where do they live?" She, ah, what's their zodiac sign? They could ask all sorts of stuff that I have no idea why this is important to her and then suddenly, Oh! I'll pop this highly contextualized thing. So, I like to say that Wendy is a person who has lots in her house and she knows how to find it when she needs it. The rest of us me included have the same amount of shit in our house but its all cluttered. And so when we need it we can't find it anywhere. And what would we do? We go by the same thing again. Because we needed it at that moment. If you had the experience in your house by the way? You have 20 of the same thing because you can never find the last one you bought. That's called continuing education. 

00:46:50
 Thank you. 

00:46:50
DR. SCOTT MILLER Yeah. Yes. 

00:46:50
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA EVO2013 

00:46:55
 Are you aware of any research about therapist being in therapy themselves - 

00:47:00
DR. SCOTT MILLER Yes. 

00:47:00
 - and whether that improves their performances as a therapist? 

00:47:00
DR. SCOTT MILLER No difference. 

00:47:00
 Thank you. 

00:47:05
DR. SCOTT MILLER No difference, no difference and no difference. And if you think about it, it should make sense. All right. Now, Norcross(ph) will say and tell you that, ah, therapist will often say that they learned it really a lot about how to do therapy by being in therapy. But there's no evidence you don't have to be a whale to write Moby-Dick. Right? And you don't have to be in therapy to do it. It just-- it just silly, ah, on its face. It's deliberate practice enough. You need to find out your errors. And by the way if you feel overwhelmed by deliberate practice and it is overwhelming when you first it your goals too big. Pick something really small. I am talking about those basics to come back to this question, that basic listening having the client feel like you heard and understood them. You know, I left that behind years ago after grad school. I got that thing down, no you didn't because that client didn't feel heard. And so I've got to extend my ability to make that connection happen. So, no. What I suggest therapist go to therapy, if they needed, yes. There is some data that suggest and it make sense if you think about it that if you're in therapy at the time you're practicing therapy that your outcome are slightly poor. But maybe that's because you, you need the help. And of course I say, if you need it you should go. But if you don't need chemotherapy it's really nasty shit today. Yeah. 

00:48:30
 Thank you. 

00:48:30
DR. SCOTT MILLER There is one. 

00:48:30
 Yes. Uhm. 

00:48:30
DR. SCOTT MILLER Yes. 

00:48:35
 So interesting I, I go to therapy and my one of the goals is professional development. 

00:48:40
DR. SCOTT MILLER One of the goals is professional growth. 

00:48:40
 Yes. Right, professional development, yes, in, in specific areas I wanted that makes a difference but then I have another, uhm, more if you could come another but this more humorous question a little bit. I thought I had, ah, book come out in 2009 and 2010 and got a lot of recognition, invitations to teach and so forth and I thought that was great. But here-- what that made me think about is this. I wonder if, you know, the great mothers and fathers of psychotherapy, the people were varied, ah, varied from, from Adler to Don Meichenbaum to yourself let say. If-- but not you're not included in this question though, I wonder if a lot of those people got, uhm, recognized and not necessarily for doing the best therapy but they are just the ones who happened to write the books and articles about it. 

00:49:30
DR. SCOTT MILLER Yeah. I, I hate that. 

00:49:30
 If, if it was an evidence-based, you know. 

00:49:30
DR. SCOTT MILLER I, I hate to say but for many of-- let me just say this way. The next time you go to learn a model don't ask what the models outcomes are. Ask what the teachers outcomes are using their model. Do you hear me? It's critical, its a critical sit-- I think all client should be asking their purpose. What are your outcomes? What are your outcomes? Tell me how effective you are and what your plans are if your not effective. What are you going to do? I, I would love to see that happen. And people become famous for lots of reasons other than their outcomes. Uhm, I'm sure that many of these people were really quite effective. But I also think that some them become famous because they were good teachers which is a reasonable thing to become famous for. Freud was a great teacher, a great writer, a pioneer, was he effective? You know, I don't know - 

00:50:15
 Yeah. 

00:50:15
DR. SCOTT MILLER - and in some cases I think he did us a favor by publishing things that weren't so great but that happened. Yeah. 

00:50:25
 Or-- or some of the people-- chari-- charisma-- 

00:50:25
DR. SCOTT MILLER Yes. We need to, we need to move on. 

00:50:25
 - or some of the people because their charismatic or their work at promoted well or because they were lucky what, whatever. 

00:50:30
DR. SCOTT MILLER Right. Really. 

00:50:35
 I think it's great that you're working on effectiveness, you know, as opposed to those other thing. 

00:50:40
DR. SCOTT MILLER Thank you. 

00:50:40
 Thanks. 

00:50:40
DR. SCOTT MILLER Yes, sorry, you've been so patient. 

00:50:40
 That's it. Thank you for talk of-- would you consider, ah, ongoing clinical supervision as a form of deliberate practice and, ah, and you're teaching and training others in psychotherapy and or either of those two better than do it or equivalent to doing your own deliberate practice? 

00:51:00
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA EVO2013 

00:51:00
DR. SCOTT MILLER You know, the supervision literature is really a tough read. Uhm, first tough it's very disorganized. Ah, there is virtually no data, ah, about its effects and the data that does exist to suggest that supervision at least the way we've traditionally done it, it doesn't seem to improve outcomes to clients. Now, I'm gonna give that field the benefit of doubt and say nobody is really look at this is all new this measurement of outcomes. But before I got supervision I'd wanna know the outcomes of that supervisor and I also wanna measure my outcomes to ensure that the more supervision I got the better the outcomes work with my clients. 

00:51:35
 Okay. 

00:51:40
DR. SCOTT MILLER Now, but do you know, this is all piousness sky, we're at the beginning of recognizing that outcomes are going to be critical and the discourse between us and payers, us and the consumers. 

00:51:50
 And maybe a second, ah, question. When our students are learning multiple different modality as of psychotherapy at the same time. 

00:51:55
DR. SCOTT MILLER Yeah. Yes. 

00:51:55
 Is-- are they any less likely to, to master, uhm, if the-- let's hear doing engaging and some kind of deliberate practice let say the thing CBT and family therapy at the same time. 

00:52:05
DR. SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:52:05
 Ah, and they're trying to engaged in some deliberate practice around their CBT and their family therapy. 

00:52:15
DR. SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:52:15
 Is there any evidence to show that focusing on just one modality at a time would yield better outcomes or learning? 

00:52:20
DR. SCOTT MILLER There's none that I know of Derrick(ph), do you know of any? So, no I, I, I'd-- you know, this is-- these are fabulous questions, great doctoral dissertations we just don't have-- we don't have any data about it. You know, I guess we could use folk wisdom and say that, ah, my son Michael right now for example is 12 and, ah, they haven't taking Spanish and French. And frankly he can't speak English very well. So, what should he do? He should be deliberately practicing English and then maybe picking up this other thing. In addition, you know, studying out of a textbook, you know, how far can this take you? You know where the-- you can ask for the bathroom and count to one to 10. What you really need to do is be in this a-- absorbed in it and have people commenting all time and that's a rare opportunity. And one time the field have that we don't have that so much. And the equality of outcomes seems to support that, that, that, ah, ah, the, the lack of those institutes any leng-- ah, any longer. Yeah. 

00:53:25
 Thank you. 

00:53:25
DR. SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:53:25
 One more. 

00:53:25
DR. SCOTT MILLER Yes. 

00:53:25
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA EVO2013 

00:53:25
 Hi, Scott, I saw Columbus and you just, ah, thrilled me with that and I've been using a form of it for six years and its, its improved my practice immensely. But I wanna go to the next level. I wanna videotape the same way the NFL video tapes their players and watch game tape on Monday. 

00:53:45
DR. SCOTT MILLER Yeah. 

00:53:45
 I'm challenged by the technology though, can you direct me in anyway of - 

00:53:45
The Evolution of Psychotherapy 2013 ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA EVO2013 

00:53:45
DR. SCOTT MILLER Use your cellphone. Use your pho-- cellphone. Sit it right there and video your session with your cellphone. Uhm, secondly I don't advice you take yourselves. Just so you know it, not unless you have a coach because video information is so dense. You won't be able to sort out what's good and bad and I promise you because I know all of you. You are hard on yourselves. There's nothing worst than a therapist could he give their own self, you know, after their done with the client, you know, then they right back on themselves sort of beating them-- themselves on the back. So when you watch your video you're gonna noticed everything that is unimportant that you did wrong. And you will miss-- you will disrupt the things that you do naturally that are good. So, you have to be-- before you start videotaping, you need to set very specific process objectives and you need to have a coach whose work you admire, want to immolate and who has a known outcomes. And, and have them watch section. So let me give you one hint, if you're gonna watch your video, watch the first five minutes. Just that first five minutes, how you introduce yourself, how you have people sit in the chair what you say to people and what you're looking for is engagement on the part of the consumer just not-- real small but get a coach. Don't do this on your own. Yeah. 

00:55:05
 Can I just ask what is the difference in terms of the practice between deliberates practice and actual practice? 

00:55:15
DR. SCOTT MILLER Practice is when you go in your offices in the way I would do. So when your going on your office and you see your clients that's your practice. 

00:55:20
 Yeah. 

00:55:20
DR. SCOTT MILLER Right. Deliberate is means that you are reflecting on the work and planning for the next work that's going to take place. 

00:55:30
 A h, so you're not do doing for practice? 

00:55:30
DR. SCOTT MILLER And these top performers? Its simply a matter-- ah, let me make one more comment and let you go. Don't be discouraged, this takes time and you're going to see minimal improvement over a longer period of time that's exactly how it works. There is no come to Jesus moment when you get the whole thing. That-- it just won't happen but you'll be better and your clients will be better off of a result. Thanks for coming to hear me everybody. Thank you.
