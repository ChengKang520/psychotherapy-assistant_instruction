00:00:10
RICH SIMON Welcome everyone to our Networker webcast series, The State of the Art of 21st-century Trauma Treatment. My name is Rich Simon. I'm your host for this series. And today we're gonna be talking about a, ah, phenomenon that's part of all of our lives but, whether we recognize it or not, but can be particularly marked in trauma treatment and can be unsettling, not only for the client, but for the therapist as well. And we're gonna be, so we're gonna be talking about dissociation, what that means and where it comes from and how to deal with that in trauma treatment. And we are very fortunate to have with us as our guest today, Chris Courtois, who is one of the foremost experts on treating trauma, PTSD and complex trauma and this phenomenon of dissociation. Chris, welcome! 

00:01:10
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Thank you. Glad to be here. 

00:01:10
RICH SIMON So tell us, ah, as your own, starting out as a therapist and somebody who was, been working with, ah, traumatized clients, ah, for a long time now, what was your first experiences in the consulting room, where you were encountering this phenomenon of dissociation? 

00:01:35
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Let me go back even earlier than that. My first experience that I was aware of was, um, when I interviewed incest survivors, and in the course of the interview, when I would ask them questions-- 

00:01:45
RICH SIMON And this is was for your dissertation? 

00:01:45
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Yes. 

00:01:50
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:01:50
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Yes, and later. In the course of the interview I would notice them doing spacing out, and I would write in the margins "spacing out." But I did not know what that meant and I did not know that that was a characteristic of someone who is traumatized. 

00:02:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:02:05
CHRISTINE COURTOIS And so it was only when the, um, dissociation began to be studied, um, by Frank Putnam and NIH and some other colleagues across the country, that I began to be able to put a name to it. Now, clinically, I didn't really realize right away that it would show up clinically, um, although I should have. And one of my most pronounced experiences was I had a client who was so, ah, traumatized from the past, but also in the midst of personal life crisis, and she wanted to work on her incest history immediately. And, by doing both at once, we overstressed her and in session she began to dissociate to the point that she became virtually catatonic. And, on a number of occasions, three(ph) occasions to be exact, I had to call an ambulance and have her transported to the emergency room because she was totally out of--she was out, but she was still conscious and it was like talking down a tunnel and she would respond to me and then be there and not be there. And when we got her to the emergency room the docs would say there's nothing wrong physically. She's having a psychiatric emergency. And it turned out that she was grossly over stimulated and what, um--so I, I learned how to titrate pretty early on (inaudible )and learned what it was. B(ph), and, um, once I learned (inaudible ) it never happened again. Ah, but since I didn't know that's what was prompting this sort of deterioration, um, I didn't do anything initially. So, one of the guidelines we'll talk about is knowing how to titrate, um, and getting people to get re-grounded in the present so something that doesn't happen. 

00:03:50
RICH SIMON Okay, so what we're, we're talking about particularly here in trauma treatment--I don't think there's an arena of, ah, therapeutic practice where, when you look back from the late 70's, early 80's, how little we understood and it, your story really illustrates that and how much we've understood, ah, subsequently. So you, you're coming into the field, you're doing your dissertation on, ah, incest survivors and you're not even familiar with the term dissociation? 

00:04:20
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Right. And I had-- 

00:04:20
RICH SIMON All right, so let's-- 

00:04:25
CHRISTINE COURTOIS I had no training in working with trauma, and I became self-trained because those were the days of the rape crisis centers and just beginning and the women's movement, and all of the training was virtually self-trained or, you know, whatever was coming out in the literature. 

00:04:40
RICH SIMON Yup. So, before we move on to that--so just to understand this, this, um, this phenomenon, dissociation, and the spectrum. So, we have on extreme--and even back in the, ah, the 50's we had Three Faces of Eve. We had, later on we had Sybil. We had these very, ah, dramatic, um, theatrical presentations of (inaudible ), but what we refer to as multiple personality. And then on the other extreme we have, um, dissociation is something we all experience and there's, ah, this spectrum. So describe for us, what is this spectrum and take us from the way in which, ah, most of us in our every day lives experience dissociation on through these, these extreme examples, somewhat, ah, in the vain of, ah, what you've already described in your story. 

00:05:30
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Okay. In normal dissociation that we all do, um, we would, um, get distracted and sort of lose our place, in a sense. Or we would, um, highway hypno-hypnosis is a good example that you're driving somewhere but you don't, you know, you're, you're off in space and you don't quite know how you got there but you got there anyway. And that's, that's normal phenomena that all of us have. Also, being highly absorbed in something; if you're absorbed in a book, um, or a movie and you don't hear around you. Um, that, that's an example of it. But where it starts to go off the, um, the spectrum and get into a range that's problematic is when it's not normal and something that can, can be, um, managed, um, consciously on a--the person is not consciously aware of it or feels at the mercy of it. And then, ah, you know, up the spectrum, of severity, it becomes more and more splits in the individuals personality and in their functioning, so that, um, it becomes much more problematic in their life. For example, if they, um, get to the point of having discontinuous time, like time will pass and they don't know. They don't know what happened during that time so amnesia is also a problem. Um, going back to the book example, if I read a book and I get sort of caught up in it and time passes I generally can tell you that I was sitting there reading a book. Um, but the highly dissociative person may not be able to, to say that-- 

00:07:05
RICH SIMON Ah. 

00:07:10
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Or may not recognize how much time has passed. Um, so there's a sense of discontinuities and sense of disremembered behavior, disremembered material. So, a lot of it could be just--colloquially, it is described as just skippage. 

00:07:25
RICH SIMON Skippage. Okay. 

00:07:25
CHRISTINE COURTOIS You know (inaudible )consciousness and memory etcetera. 

00:07:30
RICH SIMON And so what you're--in that certain part of the spectrum what you're describing is something that's really akin to a skill. It's highly functional to be able to focus, to get absorbed, to have a flow experience and then we're moving into this, this phenomenon, really, interrupting and interfering with people's lives. 

00:07:50
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Right. And, in fact, one researcher calls it a disjunctive experience and there's a lot of, um, research that's been done. It's, it's a interesting correlation that's going on that, coming out of a highly dysfunctional, um, family, and the most dysfunctional of families, what's, with attachment disorders that are of the sort that are disorganized. And I'm emphasizing the dis, 'cuz we're talking about dissociation and unassociation. But what happens in many of these families is they're so incoherent and scattered and chaotic in their interactions and how kids are, are raised and parented that that's part and parcel of what becomes part of their character. 

00:08:30
RICH SIMON Hum. 

00:08:35
CHRISTINE COURTOIS And so they learn dissociative process and they don't have coherence to themselves or to their story or to their feelings. Um, so it's been an interesting bringing together of two fields of study as we're looking at disorganized attachment and what, ah, are called intergenerational patterns of transmission that seem to be dissociative patterns in many of these families. 

00:09:00
RICH SIMON And so when we get, we, we--there's, ah, an expression that you have, um, or, ah, ah, I think it comes from you. You can correct me on this-- this idea as we move towards this, ah, what we, what's called dissociative identity disorder, which you can talk about in a moment. So we, we have this, this, um, in a previous conversation you and I talked about this, escape where there is no escape. So tell us about dissociative identity disorder. What, what is that and how's that different than these episodes of dissociation that we've been talking about so far? 

00:09:35
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Well, let me back up for a minute in that the escape where there's no escape is usually a way to, to be, to begin to understand how and why this happens. Um, dissociation has the, the highest likelihood to occur in childhood and in adolescence. And those of us who have adolescence who are spacey understand that really well. 

00:09:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:09:55
CHRISTINE COURTOIS But, when, um, which we're often talking in, in these circumstances, and especially D.I.D, we're talking about circumstances of chronic, ongoing child abuse and neglect; um, all of which are very, very, very important. And when the child is entrapped in a family setting or some other setting where the abuse and mistreatment and non-response is continuous, so that would be disorganized attachment. They have to find some way to cope and for many of them dissociation is a natural process. We see kids who have imaginary companions and then we see kids who do fantasy kinds of things. Those are normal things but they--over time those can, can be in the interest of survival so that a child begins to split away from, and not know, some of what happened and can escape, um, psycho biologically where there's no physical escape. And, in a, in a very handy way, and, um, thankful, um, mechanism, what happens with intense or extreme dissociation work--again, another way to think about it is, we're talking about fight, flight, freeze, and then beyond freeze is tonic immobility. When an animal or a child gets into that state, their physiology is flooded with, um, anesthesia and analgesia, so that if they're being physically hurt, in addition to being emotionally hurt, they may not feel it. Um, so it could be extremely profound and dense and when it's of that character, and it's needed like that so intensively, these are the kinds of situations that are likely to lead to more high level, um, more intense dissociative disorders including especially D.I.D. Now-- 

00:11:50
RICH SIMON Just say a bit more about what is D.I.D and what--how does, how does the therapist, what, what does one see as the therapist when a client is coming in and, particularly if you're, you have no preparation for it, how do you begin to feel oh, my(ph), this, this person really is, ah, at, at this farthest end of the spectrum? 

00:12:10
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Right. Let's also begin with talking about, right now in the D.S.M., there are five identified dissociative disorders, and there's also dissociative process so that someone can be mildly dissociative and that doesn't make them D.I.D. 

00:12:25
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:12:25
CHRISTINE COURTOIS And in the past, I think, that a number of clinicians have really made mistakes, and big mistakes, by, by, ah, seeing--if they see dissociation then automatically this is a person with dissociative identity disorder. That's not the case. And the criteria for D.I.D. in the D.S.M. currently is pretty loose, um, but none-the-less is what we, we have to work with. And the criteria are that the individual, um, executive control of the individual moves to another part self. And while the individual is in that other part self they have amnesia, they're amnesic for what happens during that period of time. So you may see someone switch into a part self that's dramatically different and then switch back. And when they switch back they're perplexed because they've lost time and they have no idea what happened during that interaction. 

00:13:30
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:13:30
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Now that's one of the things that you might see clinically, and when that happens, when you see somebody move back and forth in that way, it's really important to ask them whether they have memory for what transpired, because it's that, that lack of memory that is one of the diagnostic markers. Now, that said, I don't ever, um, diagnose anybody with D.I.D. without having seen that happen a number of times, because D.I.D. is a high, highly controversial diagnosis, as you know, and we want to be careful with making that diagnosis. There's also something called D.D.N.O.S., which is Dissociative Disorder Not Otherwise Specified, which is a catch-all. So somebody dissociated--and even they might describe having a part of me, um, as all of us do colloquially. Um, that may not meet criteria for a full-blown D.I.D., and sometimes D.I.D. shows--Richard Kluft, who's one of the experts in the field, talks about windows of diagnosability that very often it will, it is a hidden disorder and deliberately hidden by the individual who has D.I.D., and it may come forward if the individual's particularly stressed, um, and these windows of diagnosability open. And then after the stress and pressure go away they may be able to, again, return to a point of not showing it very much. 

00:14:55
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:15:00
CHRISTINE COURTOIS So it's very variable, like P.T.S.D. is and it can be extremely florid; and I can give you some very florid examples from my own practice. 

00:15:10
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:15:10
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Or it can be very, very, um, mild and if you don't look for it or you don't know it, you miss it. So it can really vary pretty dramatically and it can vary in the same person pretty dramatically. 

00:15:25
RICH SIMON So it--since you--so give us--and we're, we're gonna move on in a moment to more of, ah, how you, ah, as a therapist, assess and, and treat folks who are coming in who have various, ah, or experience in dissociation in, in more extreme ways. But give us, ah, this contrast between, ah, a more, a blander version and a florid version of dissociative-- 

00:15:50
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Okay. 

00:15:50
RICH SIMON What, what do these, what, what do, what are these folks like? 

00:15:55
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Okay, a blander version, you might see someone who flutters their eyes, has an eye-roll, their voice might change, their posture might change, they could pull their hair in front of their face so that you can't really see, or they posturally remove away from you. And there's something that's different but it's not, again, florid. 

00:16:15
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:16:20
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Um, and, ah, pretty subtle. Um, but it's, it may still be D.I.D. It still might be the criteria. 

00:16:25
RICH SIMON (inaudible )their voice-tone and there's a--who's talk(ph)-- 

00:16:30
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Posture(ph), yes. 

00:16:30
RICH SIMON Who's talking now that there's-- 

00:16:30
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Yeah. 

00:16:35
RICH SIMON I'm not talking to this person I was talking to in some subtle way a few moments ago? 

00:16:40
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Yes. And also, ah, choice of words may change. There's what I call Dissociative Language, um, that often the individual-- and usually this is a result of the, of a slip in their defensiveness. But they'll refer to themselves as "we." They'll talk in plural or they'll talk about him or her and they're refer--referring to other parts of the self. So when those kinds of things happen that's another one of those subtle signs that is very easy for a clinician to just pass it over and, you know, every once in a while we all use plural but when I hear it repeatedly I'll go back and say, you know, you seem to be re, be referring to yourself in, in the plural here. Can you tell me more about that? 

00:17:20
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:17:20
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Other dissociative language is that it, ah, it's often in third person, um, so that if they're, if a client is talking about his or her mother, it's the mother. Um, and they refer to themselves as the other. So you'll hear a lot of that kind of language which is--and, and when you think about it, is really disowning language. It's not mine. This is not my mother. This is the mother. 

00:17:45
RICH SIMON The mother. 

00:17:45
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Keeping it out there. And over time, and this, this is a really good example for what needs to happen therapeutically, over time you have to invite the client to identify this person as their mother and as their, you know, as connected to them and not disowned in this, in the way through that verbal means. And I actually had a client who was in a very high degree of trans logic, meaning that this kind of, um, illogic was very logical to him. And I said to him one day, I said, you know, you're really talking about your biological mother. And he said I am? He had com--in that part self he had completely disowned that this was truly his mother, as bazaar as that sounds. 

00:18:35
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:18:35
CHRISTINE COURTOIS That's what happens. 

00:18:35
RICH SIMON And so in the florid, and this--so that's an example of this more, kind of florid presentation that you, you were talking to? 

00:18:45
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Well that, that latter is, but I was talking about the subtle presentation before. 

00:18:50
RICH SIMON Yeah. Moving-- 

00:18:50
CHRISTINE COURTOIS But then in a very florid--I'll give you a couple of examples that I, I was asked by a colleague to, um, dia--to talk to someone about her background. The diagnosis had been already made, and as I was talking to her-- and, in fact, I was talking to her about dysfunctional families and attachment, she switched and she switched dramatically. And she went from being a calm, like, graduate student, to a massively enraged adolescent. She started screaming at me and she started, and you'll excuse my language everybody-- 

00:19:25
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:19:25
CHRISTINE COURTOIS But she started saying "she's a little bitch. It's all her fault." Okay? Get the language. " It's all her fault that we're in the middle of this. If I could only do away with her, that little bitch, I would be fine." 

00:19:40
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:19:40
CHRISTINE COURTOIS So that was an adolescent part self that was enraged. And as fast as that came out, all of the sudden the client sort of shrunk, switched again, started crying inconsolably and was in a child-state, saying "make her start, stop yelling at me. She's really hurting me. She thinks that I did all of this and it's all my fault. She's hurting me." 

00:20:10
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:20:10
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Okay? So those were obviously very florid. I like to joke that when the hair on the back of your neck stands up-- 

00:20:15
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:20:20
CHRISTINE COURTOIS You know something's happening. 

00:20:20
RICH SIMON That's the diagnostic indicator? Okay. Yeah. 

00:20:20
CHRISTINE COURTOIS What happened in that case is 30 minutes went by while we had these, these switches and at, and we're coming close to the end of wrapping up and I asked for the part who had come in to come back, and she did. And she came back and looked very dazed, like she was coming out of a dream or something, and, um, I asked her if she knew anything of what had just transpired. And I asked her look at the clock 'cuz a half an hour had gone by, and she had no idea of what had just happened. 

00:20:55
RICH SIMON Hum. 

00:20:55
CHRISTINE COURTOIS And did not know anything about those switches that had occurred, so it was outside of her conscious awareness. So another thing that needs to happen in the course of treatment is to make these kinds of episodes much more conscious, to make the client more consciously aware, and then you help the client to have control of them because when the client's in the throws of very heavy duty D.I.D., they may loose control of all kinds of things, um, and find themselves in situations that are either unsavory or embarrassing. We had a client who came in to our hospital program and she was highly distressed. She came from a small community. She had gone to, um, her son's school and something there had triggered her and she ended up under the, under a desk, sucking her thumb in a child-state in front of all the other parents. So this was another, un-out of control, and another reason when D.I.D. is that active, it's very important to identify it and help people to begin to find ways to get grounded and to control their dissociative switches. So initially their, um, they--at point of diagnosis they often seem uncontrollable and the client may tell you that these things just happen to me and that, over time, the therapist has to help them not just happen, but to be able to control them. 

00:22:25
RICH SIMON So give us a--how, how do we begin to understand how common that kind of extreme florid version. So, ah, within the trauma spectrum there's a, a great deal of, of the phenomenon of dissociations; part of all of our lives and, as we move into trauma response it becomes, ah, perhaps more common. What about what you've just describing--how is-- and is this part of the controversy? Is it that some people thinking, ah, D.I.D. is really a very rare phenomenon or is it I--iatrogenic(ph), therapist-created phenomenon? First of all, give us a little bit of a flavor; how common in, in your view and, and is there any, ah, any, any really data about this? 

00:23:05
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Yeah, there are data that have come available. Collin Ross in particular, um, was one of the early researchers who began to look at, um, the percentage. And it's believed that, um, I think it's 15% of the population likely has some kind of dissociative disorder or condition. And, of that, another percentage, um, has full-blown D.I.D., but I don't know if that percentage has been established. But-- 

00:23:35
RICH SIMON Is that, is that tiny percentage of that? Do we, do we have any explanation? 

00:23:40
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Well, I think any of us who are treating this population don't believe it's so tiny; that it may be, sort of five percent of the psychiatric population. Something like that. So it, that creates a large number of, of individuals. Now, during the memory controversy of the early '90's, you know the critics were saying "How on Earth could there be so many of these people," and, you know, that this is, is iatrogenic. And, um, you know, those of us, again, who've been treating traumatized people for a long time, um, really believe that it's been there all along and it hasn't been recognized to the degree that it is now, and that's why it's being diagnosed. That said, I have no doubt that there were false diagnosis that were made, again, on the basis of therapists believing that if somebody dissociates a little bit, or somebody talks about a part self, that that automatically, ah, creates a condition of D.I.D. 

00:24:35
RICH SIMON Okay. So let's move here into how you work. And this is a series where we're really trying to talk to, to various leaders in this field of trauma treatment; understand what are their working methods, their procedures. So, as part of--when you're working with a client, as part of your assessment procedure, you're trying to see the role, the degree to which dissociation is part of the difficulty that experiencing. How do you structure that? What are you looking for? What are the kinds of questions that you ask in the process? 

00:25:05
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Well, it begins, it begins with our, our broad psycho-social evaluation. And, you know, another guideline, um, that almost goes without saying, but I have seen people sort of jump in and start working with D.I.D. when they didn't, D.I.D., ostensibly D.I.D., when they hadn't even done an evaluation. So don't take the client's, um, word for it. Um, don't take somebody's word that my previous therapist diagnosed this. It's important that you start seeing the phenomenology. 

00:25:35
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:25:35
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Um, so it's good practice to always begin with a very open, um, and extensive psycho-social evaluation and to watch what happens when you ask questions about trauma, very broad-based questions; and about abuse experiences and crisis in families and how the family functioned. And, if you're starting to hear of a great deal of dysfunction, or great deal of, of abuse and even if it's not detailed, those would be the clients that would be more likely to be dissociative. Um, and, ah, a more extensive history, one that started in childhood. Now, another guideline is D.I.D. is a condition resulting from childhood trauma, so if somebody says, well, I was, ah, abused only in adulthood, it would be highly unlikely and highly unusual for them to have D.I.D. 

00:26:35
RICH SIMON That's very important. 

00:26:35
CHRISTINE COURTOIS D.I.D. is a condition of childhood abuse, and I've heard Frank Putnam, in fact, say that the child's ability to dissociate peaks at about age eight or nine. And so, by the time they're ten or eleven the trauma should have been what was occurring in the past. Of course it may continue but it's that, that early setup that sets up the dissociative condition of dealing with, um, you know, the ongoing, ah, traumatization or neglect or whatever, whatever it is. So when I hear that kind of history it begins to set that up. As I'm interviewing someone, um, and even in a psycho-social evaluation, hopefully folks are asking open-ended questions. Did this happen to you? How did it happen to you? Ah, also with an understanding that it may have happened and a client's not ready to tell you-- 

00:27:25
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:27:30
CHRISTINE COURTOIS But even asking those questions and listening to somebody who starts to define or disclose or describe what happened to them, I want to be very, um, mindful of their own presentation of self. I want to be watching their eyes, watching their face. Um, just seeing if there are any changes that would seem to be indicative of a dissociative process. And, again, that might be things like eye-fluttering, um, staring, um, looking away, spacing out; that early spacing out thing. And I want to just register that and if it seems like there's a lot of that--and some people now do this as a standard part of their, um, early assessment, might want to use, ah, something called the dissociative experiences scale, which is a 28-item instrument or set of questions about exactly what it says, dissociative experiences. And it asks the client to endorse how often do these happen to you? It's very, very face-valid. It's very easy to fake. But for clients who do dissociate they will start telling you, and not only will they mark, it's always zero to a hundred scale, but you ask them to mark the scale. And what I do is I make a clinical interview about it. If they tell me that they dissociate 80% of the time in this way I'll say I want to know how you do that. Tell me more. So it becomes ah, um, a structured interview for me. And when clients endorse a certain number, and this is a very additive scale, when they endorse a certain number of symptoms, there are cut-offs that are indicative of this client is likely dissociative. This is simply a screening interview but if you get a high endorsement it's enough to go forward to begin the process of continuing to look for other dissociation. 

00:29:25
RICH SIMON Okay, and just let me underline something that I think is implicit in what you're saying. So you're not just talking about D.I.D. here. You're talking about dissociation. One doesn't have to have full blown symptoms of D.I.D-- 

00:29:35
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Exactly. 

00:29:35
RICH SIMON Dissociation is, is one of the, the crucial manifestations, ah, disruptive manifestations of traumatic experience that you're, that you want to address as a therapist. 

00:29:45
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Right, and other, other things you might become very mindful of is the client who tells you things and then comes in the next session and says they don't remember anything about the session before. 

00:29:55
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:29:55
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Um, or in the course of the session I had one client who was quite funny. We've, we've laughed about it. She said, "Chris, you must have just said something really important 'cuz I didn't hear it." It was just a dissociative skip. So when you get those kinds of things, um, and a lot of memory loss or session-to-session memory loss, um, or a lot of incoherence; that's another important word that I've learned, which is, um, I had one particular client who, um, came and when he started treatment, he was speaking English and I could not understand what he was saying. He was skipping all over the place and nothing came out straight. And I was totally perplexed until I remember the attachment literature I'd been studying and I remembered the incoherence of discourse that happens from dissociative families. And as soon as I put the label incoherent on this guy's talk, then I could understand that this was a manifestation of just how scrambled he was. And in the old days--I've treated him now for eight years--in the old days he could not, he did not have a consistent narrative of his life. Now, if he were with us here today, he has a very consistent understanding and a lifeline of what happened to him, how it effected him; and a lot of that has been due to what we've been able to do in treatment to allow that material to come forward and also to be explained and processed by him. 

00:31:40
RICH SIMON So, so let's talk a little bit as, as, as, at this point about dissociation and memory. You've, you've talked a, a few moments ago, you referred back to the false memory debates and all that controversy. Many people at that time are thinking, "what are you talking about, you therapist, you nutty therapist?" You're instilling memories in people, you know, when something happens to you it's stored in there, this--and, and therapist are, we're creating this, this realm where memories were being recovered. So, at, from the point--now it's 20 years later--what do we understand about dissociated memories and people recovering memories from childhood that previously they did not have? 

00:32:25
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Well, you know, we had some of this information back then, um, and I don't know if you recall, but I was a member of the American Psychological Association task force on memory, ah, which was loaded, ah, and-- 

00:32:40
RICH SIMON Um-hum. It was, that was, that was quite an era. Yup. 

00:32:45
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Yes, it was quite an era and, you know, what we, um, what we learned at that time was that the, much of what is known about human memory was for normal event memory and what hadn't been studied, and has been studied more since then, is memory having to do with traumatizing events. And now there are date that suggests that there may be, um, problems in coding of the material, there may be problems with retaining it and there may be problems with recall as you're suggesting. 

00:33:15
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:33:20
CHRISTINE COURTOIS What is very important is that in circumstances where a client doesn't know or suspects abuse, that the therapist not fill in the gap with a storyline. Um, instead it's very important that we all tolerate the uncertainty of knowing or not knowing and realizing that, for some people, material may come, may not come back. For others it's there in a state of dormancy and once they're triggered in one way or another it often begins to emerge on their, as a result of triggers. Now, by the way, the false memory people were saying that the triggers were always the therapist's suggestion-- 

00:34:00
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:34:00
CHRISTINE COURTOIS And some of the research is showing rather than that, it is the circumstance of the client's life. And media reports, ah, very often have served as major triggers to, to, um, the return of memory that has been sequestered or put aside in the interest of escaping it and then again, in the interest of, of coping. So, um, you know, there are many ways to understand it. Um, I wrote a book at the time, after being on that task force, called "Recollections of Sexual Abuse Treatment Principles and Guidelines," and I did that to help therapists understand, ah, what to do and what not to do. That therapists really need to stay, what's called supportively neutral, in asking about this, um, too, and, and to not fill in the gaps-- 

00:34:50
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:34:50
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Of memory, and instead to tolerate it. And there are some clients who are very, very, um, you know, um, pushy about you have to find my memories for me now. And, um, that's not possible for therapists to do, and in fact, this man I was just describing, um, who was so incoherent in his presentation, he came into treatment saying to me, "Doctor Courtois, you must find my incest memories for me." And that's not a viable treatment goal. 

00:35:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:35:25
CHRISTINE COURTOIS And today he would never say that. 

00:35:25
RICH SIMON And so, so what, so this controversy consumed us for a good part of the 1990's and there-- 

00:35:35
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Yes. 

00:35:35
RICH SIMON Of course, whenever you bring in, um, ah, the, ah, court system and litigation at that, that's traumatizing for everybody, particularly if you're being sued. So these days what's the state of false memories? Is, ah, is this, is, is this a, an active issue? Do you feel like the, that the therapy community has learned, um, learned a lesson coming out of this and that this, you, you don't hear these days that these, that therapists have, are making the kinds of mistakes that you're referring to or the potential mistakes that you're referring to and what you were just talking to us about? 

00:36:15
CHRISTINE COURTOIS No, I think the field has advanced considerably from that time, and I think, um, from my perspective, the false memory critics, um, concerns were, um, high, some of them were highly inaccurate and highly over generalized. Again, that said, that doesn't mean that therapists didn't make mistakes now, I, and I, I think a lot of that was out of ignorance because I, I mean, in today's curriculum we still don't teach people about how to treat trauma or how to treat dissociation, which is really, ah, you know, a travesty and a tragesty(ph), tragedy. So, um, some therapists real, really overstated the case and they made mistakes and that was part of what created the controversy. 

00:37:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:37:00
CHRISTINE COURTOIS But I think today there's significant, um, date that support, and in fact there's gonna be a big review paper that comes out in Psyche Bulletin this year that is, um, comparing whether D.I.D. is the creation of fantasy or creation on the part of the therapist, um, or it is related to past traumatization. And the accumulated data really are in favor of the fact that it is in response to having been traumatized. So, um, I think we're seeing those kinds of differentiations and there's a lot more research on memory for traumatic versus non-traumatic events that suggest that this is a fairly, um, normal response to abnormal circumstances. We also talked about, um, you and I, the, um, the theory of structural dissociation, which is a psycho-biological theory, and it's related to all the brain work research that is happening. And in that theory what is, um, speculated to happen is, as the individual splits off, um, part of their experience from a trauma, usually the emotional part, in order to allow them to function normally in the world. They, their brain actually is changing as a result of that and so that theory is really talking about, um, sequestered information and, ah, the brain itself, that is biological changed by virtue of having been through this, um, traumatization and the P.T.S.D. and dissociation. 

00:38:35
RICH SIMON Not just--and, and from what we know now that we didn't know 20 years ago, about brain development, what you're telling us earlier about the, this, ah, this phenomenon that Putnam and others(ph) have talked about, about the developing brain and, and horrible experiences happening to kids before they turn eight or nine or so, that it would, it, it's, it certainly sounds much more plausible that the, at certain stages these, the, the brain is shaped by the, by, ah, extremely stressful, traumatizing experiences in a way that could lead to the kinds of symptoms that, that can show up in a therapist's office years later with D.I.D. 

00:39:15
CHRISTINE COURTOIS And Frank Putnam had a very nice way of putting it and he talked and he, he's a developmentalist, um, and he said that in normal development what happens is experiences co-cohere and experiences come together and get integrated. Even though a kid may have an imaginary companion for a period of time, over time that becomes part of self-experience. 

00:39:40
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:39:40
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Whereas, with the highly dissociative kid, the tracks are laid down very differently and so the speculation is different parts of the brain and, and actually there's some data to support this, different parts of the brain light up in different self-states. 

00:39:55
RICH SIMON Yup. 

00:39:55
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Ah, because the brain has developed in a very specialized way to accommodate the ongoing traumatization. 

00:40:00
RICH SIMON Without this integration, this connection. 

00:40:05
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Yeah. Yup. 

00:40:05
RICH SIMON All right, in the time that, that's left let's, let's move here to, ah, talk about the way you do treatment and give people, ah, a flavor. So you're, ah, the watchword everyone we've talked to in the series says the same thing about the importance of going slow, not moving quickly, ah, establishing safety early on, the early stages of, of trauma treatment, establishing the alliance with the client. No, there's not rush in this kind of work, and then, and the importance of going through phases and people have different notions of what those phases are. Can you tell us about your model and what are the phases? How do you, once you get a sense of what you're dealing with and, well, dissociation for example, and the person's symptoms, how do you, how do think about the, ah, treatment process with trauma? 

00:40:55
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Okay, well I think about this, um, dissociation as part of com, a complex trauma reaction, so I would call it complex dissociative trauma, post traumatic reaction. And, it does fall that the three-phase model that has been developed, um, for treatment of complex trauma again, as you're suggesting that we really need to stabilize the person first. And for somebody who is just slightly, somewhat dissociative or more on the subtle end and maybe has, um, ah, a more limited trauma experience, their--and maybe they have a good attachment history. Um, they're going to go through the stabilization phase much more quickly and, um, they've got supports and they, they can deal with the trauma much more readily. But for someone who has the, the, the, the higher intensity dissociative or D.I.D. or P.T.S.D, chaotic um, sentimentology, they may have extremely chaotic lives. They may, um, have, you know, a degree of conscious awareness, maybe highly impacted. They may cope, um, by using, ah, dysfunctional behaviors, ah, because they don't know how to regulate their emotions, so these are the people who may cut themselves or may be chronically suicidal or chronically compulsive; whatever it is. And all of that really needs to be addressed early on, and the more you can address that and help people with skill building, grounding themselves, learning how to have emotions, learning to regulate their emotions and learning to be in a, a, stabile, therapeutic relationship. All of those are therapeutic gains. They may not be the actual dealing with the trauma but what we like to say is early phase, phase one work is measured in, um, not in time, but in, um, the client's status; the mastery of skills. And it's only after the client, which, which can take a considerable period of time, um, as you're suggesting, and some people never go beyond stage one. But if they start to develop the capacity to be talking about trauma, um, experiences and feeling the feelings, what's been split off, that's an indication that they're ready to start putting the picture together. And phase two is formally when the trauma, um, emotional processing is being done. And that simply means that you're putting the storyline of the trauma together with the feeling state, and then you're sort of looking at how the client has made sense of this, and what they believe about themselves, what they believe about what happened to them, their cognitions. And, in the course of this, you really want to, as the therapist, be very attuned and be helping to, um, ah, correct erroneous information or challenge erroneous beliefs in a way that you wouldn't do in phase one because it would be too overwhelming. Pat Ogden, in her work, and other clinicians have talked about raising the threshold or increasing the window of the threshold of the client's ability to deal with a high intensity of emo-emotion. Most traumatized clients have very, very limited windows, and what we're trying to do is open their, their emotional regulation capacity and their emotional tolerance. Um, whether it's P.T.S.D, or whether it's dissociation or both, these clients are highly avoidant and they don't, um, they do everything they can to avoid, um, the feelings that go with the storyline. And so, in phase two, you're, you're really trying to get them to work those. And there are a variety of techniques at this point that are, um, evidence-supported, ah, empirically supported; they involve prolonged exposure or E.M.D.R. or graduated exposure. There are, are a number of techniques that are used in that phase, but basically what you're wanting to do is, again, to get clients to bring all of these pieces together so that it becomes a more coherent whole. And they feel it more because it's not so, um, disintegrated or dissociated. And over time they're able to hold more emotion and understand it more and accept it more. And then the third phase is, as their in more control and the symptoms begin to drop off, the P.T.S.D. symptoms, as they're more control, in control of their reaction in themselves, they feel better and then they begin to apply that to, ah, the rest of their life. Um, for example, I've had people, um, make difference changes in their, um, occupations because they'll say, well I went into this occupation not because I wanted to but because I was told that I had to or that it was the only thing that was available to a schmuck like me. And as they begin to feel better about themselves they may see that they have other opportunities. 

00:46:15
RICH SIMON More possibilities, okay. 

00:46:15
CHRISTINE COURTOIS The issue of relationships is also very important. Obviously if you, if you've been hurt repeatedly by intimates, um, you don't trust people very much. So the therapeutic relationship is basically a conduit for helping people to really understand the betrayal that they've experienced, but that not all people are going to abuse them or, um, ah, neglect them in the same way, and teaching them about reciprocity and trustworthy relationships with others. So that happens over time also to the degree that we want any of these clients, regardless of their diagnosis, to, to have what's called Earned Security of Attachment, meaning that they move from a disorganized or other insecure style of attachment to one that is, um, more secure and allows them to really have their own feelings. 

00:47:15
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:47:15
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Um, so it can be a process that for some people is shorter term. And we now have some, what I call hybrid models of treatment, that are quite short-term and that work for people but-- 

00:47:25
RICH SIMON And short-term means? What's, what is, in that, in that, in that realm what's the short-term treatment? 

00:47:30
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Um, Marilyn Cloutre's Stair Model-- 

00:47:35
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:47:35
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Ah, Julian Ford's Target Model-- 

00:47:40
RICH SIMON And, but in terms of, of the time, ah, what, what's-- 

00:47:40
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Ah, 16 to 20 sessions. 

00:47:45
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:47:45
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Which is really short-term. 

00:47:45
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:47:45
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Um, whereas, for some of these clients, they're gonna require much more time and effort than that. Um, but it's nice to have short-term models too, because another cri-critique from the old days, the bad old days, was that, you know, once a, a client goes into treatment they never get out. And we do want them to, to know that there's an end result. And the progression that I was just talking about is really helpful for the therapist to know that, and that there are different treatment tasks by, by different phase, that, when you're going along, you know, there's a clear trajectory that you share with the client so that they're not in the dark either. This is not never-ending. 

00:48:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:48:30
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Ah, client's functioning is really important, that you want to increase or maintain functioning and not have them decrease and decompensate over the period of, of treatment. 

00:48:40
RICH SIMON So, so let's, if, if you could--so we have about ten minutes left in, in this, our, our time. And I wonder, is, if there's a case to give people--I think you've, you've, you've done a really, ah, terrific job here of giving us a sense of these phases in, in kind of the, in broad terms. Is there a case you can just kind of tell us within in, in ten minutes worth of detail of how you work? Of, of where somebody started, of what this first stage consists of, these skills that we, that you teach, the stabilization process; what you did in your, in this second phase and, and then how the, ah, how ultimately the, ah, the, the treatment ended and where they were at the end of the process. So if you could just give--this doesn't speak to all issues of the kind of work that you do, but just somebody that, that, ah, stands out for you. 

00:49:30
CHRISTINE COURTOIS I have somebody that, the man that I was describing, who came in wanting me to tell, um, him his, his memories, and also being so incoherent. Ah, his treatment is not over, but he's given me permission to, um, discuss and describe his treatment. And, um, it began by this identification of the incoherence. And then, he is, this man, despite this incoherence, personally, is a very high-level and was working in a very high-level of the Federal Government, and was quite, um, ah, at the top of the, of the grade level. 

00:50:10
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:50:10
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Despite that, he had a belief from his childhood that he was stupid and totally inadequate, and the only reason he had succeeded was because he worked so hard. Um, he also thought that he had a very low I.Q., where it turned out he has a very high I.Q., but his parents had continuously put him down and suggested that he was really stupid. He also, um, is highly distractible and dissociative and he, then he though he had A.D.D. He got diagnosed with A.D.D. and he took medications but the medications didn't help him at all. So that was an indicator that it probably wasn't A.D.D., but it, in all likelihood, it was, um, dissociation. Prior to working with me he had been in treatment for 20 years. Some of the treatment had actually worked. Um, he said when he started treatment he had no recognition of being, of having any feelings whatsoever. He had been in group treatment and other group members used to have flash cards with feelings on them so that they would reflect back to him what, what his feelings were. Um, so he had, he had some, done some things before he started treatment but, um, what we did was, as we began to identify the, um, the, the dissociation, um, then I was able to teach him not just having feelings, but how to regulate his feelings, how to manage his feelings. Um, and he had extensive stories about, or storylines about what had happened to him as a child, ah, which were quite horrific, but he was fine as long as he didn't put a feeling with it. And so what we began to do is just gradually, you know, sort of, um, push and nudge to get some of the emotional, um, some of the emotions out. As that happened I began, he began to demonstrate. And he had a large number of crises in his life in his life-- 

00:52:10
RICH SIMON Interesting soundtrack as you describe this. We begin to, we have, ah, fire engines and emergency-- 

00:52:20
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Oh, yes. I'm sorry. Sorry 'bout that. 

00:52:20
RICH SIMON Well, well, I thought you'd, I thought you'd orchestrated it actually for us. 

00:52:25
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Yes. No, I live right around the corner from a-- 

00:52:25
RICH SIMON I'm sorry. Go ahead. 

00:52:30
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Fire station. 

00:52:30
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:52:30
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Anyway, um, what was I saying? 

00:52:30
RICH SIMON So you, you were just describing how, that he could, he was fine as long as he didn't have the fire engine feeling inside himself. 

00:52:40
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Yes, and, but all these crisis that happened in his life, he had gone, also gone back to his parents, trying to identify what had had been so awful about his upbringing and they denied everything. However, he said, he says, and his wife confirmed this, that his father was so irate with him asking that the father stood up, ah, the father who was a chronic alcoholic, stood up, screamed at him and said nothing happened to you and you're childhood wasn't so bad and then hit the table so hard that he broke it. So, there, there was reason to believe that there was a lot of defensiveness in this family and the, the family was totally, is currently totally broken down. 

00:53:25
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:53:25
CHRISTINE COURTOIS But, um, as we went forward and as these crisis happened in his, his life and his work life and his family life, um, what began to, to be clear was he did have part selves that were merging in the therapy process, and I think both of us were quite surprised. I didn't anticipate it, but he was so good and he and I have, have actually come to understand that he has a part self called The Deflector. And sometimes there are names that go along with these part selves, and anytime anybody got anywhere close to what was happening to him emotionally, they got deflected off, including me. And it took a long time before we were able to develop enough trust in the relationship, um, for things not to be deflected off. And I'll give you just a, a general example of that. When I would go on vacation or, or for a consulting trip, this man had a history of very serious abandonment so you would, by his mother, so you would expect that he would have reactions. And he had no reactions, and he'd just sit there placidly and say have a good time. 

00:54:30
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:54:30
CHRISTINE COURTOIS And one day, um, I said well, I'm really surprised that you don't have any reactions. He says, oh, that's not me. I said, well what do you mean? He said, I leave Little Kid outside. He's the one with reactions. Now, those were his words, not my words. And we since have learned that there are part selves who are children who carry all of these emotions that he doesn't, he wasn't carrying and that that was a perfect deflective device. This man is also, um, a master at the defensive displacement and, um, when the priest abuse scandal first hit, he was highly agitated and unnerved, and I couldn't tell what was going on, ah, or whether he'd been abused by a priest, which at that point, he had not acknowledged. But, it turned out that he was absolutely enraged at the Bishops. And when I asked him about what that was about he said, well, they should have protected those children. Don't you understand that? And what had come out about his own father, his, his own father had been a fall-down drunk who was never home, never protected the children, never paid attention to them. So I very quietly said to him during this period, I think you're, you might be talking about your feelings about your own father. And he said, you think you're so smart. And Bingo! I was right on the mark because he was talking about the father as the priest and the bishops, but in reality he was talking about his own feelings. And this is just a great example of how these feelings get deflected and displaced all over the place, but they're not mine. 

00:56:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:56:20
CHRISTINE COURTOIS And now, after we've done considerable work of just re-bringing this back and re-associating him with his past, he now can tell you that yes, I--well, he used to say to me--this is another good example--he used to say to me I didn't have a father and I had no father, which, at one level is true, 'cuz his father didn't function as a father. But his father was in his house the whole time he was raised, so I kept saying to him, you did have a father. He was there. But he was not a father to you and you're trying to pretend that it had no effect on you. 

00:57:00
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:57:00
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Um, it had no effect on me. Well, over time, it's gonna become very, very obvious, um, that it had a profound effect. And sometimes I had to go equally sideways to get at material. I said to him one day so, your father taught you how to play ball? No, and my father didn't do anything like that. And I said well, I guess it didn't bother you? Yes, it did. And those are some of the kinds of ways (inaudible )have to go to get some of this material out. So today-- 

00:57:35
RICH SIMON So here's--yeah. 

00:57:35
CHRISTINE COURTOIS He can say he had a very painful childhood that was, involved a lot of abuse by his mother, a lot of profound neglect by his father, to the point that it was like his father wasn't there, and, um, multiple other abuses and it, um, it took a lot out of his life because his dissociation was so strong that it was very hard for him to live a, a cohesive life. 

00:58:05
RICH SIMON And, and so what I'm getting from what you're saying is it's--so, being able to describe and understand this, have a coherent narrative is the, ah, is, is the term of the(ph) coherent life narrative is one piece of it. But to, um, begin to--that as a means to the, to being able to, ah, have a, an emotional range in life itself, this final phase of reconnecting with, with life; that rather than being so damped down, so utter(ph) removed from emotion that you can experience the, the pleasures. You allow yourself to feel the vitality of-- 

00:58:45
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Right. I have another, another great example from this case, which I use very often. When we started he was so tracked on wanting his incest memories and in the course of this incoherence he said to me, but I'm gonna be just like my father and I'm gonna blow up my retirement. And I said--I had no, no way of understanding what that meant and it turned out his father had gotten fired and was a deadbeat and all kinds of things. And I said, how is it that you're gonna blow up your retirement at a high level of federal government? And he said, I don't know, but I'm gonna do it just like my father, which is, ah, out of consciousness, traumatic reenactment. 

00:59:20
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

00:59:20
CHRISTINE COURTOIS And what we did was, I established our first treatment goal was that he had to reach his, his day of retirement benefits so that he could retire. And I'm very pleased to say two years ago he did retire and he has benefits. And, um, he's not in the process of going into a whole different career that is exactly what you're saying, self-determined. He has a whole range of other feelings. There's much more awareness. He also has had to work hard to accept the fact that other people think highly of him because his own parents were so limited that-- 

01:00:00
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:00:00
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Um, so that's been a very different thing too. 

01:00:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

01:00:05
CHRISTINE COURTOIS He's well-loved by a lot of people and he didn't know that. 

01:00:05
RICH SIMON Yeah. So, you know, there's, so those are the kinds of experiences that, you know, really make it, ah, make, make it, that with all the ups and downs in a therapist's life, you really feel like you're (inaudible ). 

01:00:19
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Yes, yes. Well we actually-- 

01:00:20
RICH SIMON So, um-- 

01:00:20
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Can I give you one more example? 

01:00:20
RICH SIMON Sure--

CHRISTINE COURTOIS We actually had one session that was particularly poignant. I can't remember how we got there but at the end of the session, um, he was, he was very, um, overwhelmed and I had to leave to do group so I offered him to sit in my office until he sort of got reconsolidated and when I came back after the group he had left me a note and he said, I want you to know that I am a person, exclamation point, signed with his name and that was very poignant, as you can imagine, and made the work worth it. 

01:00:55
RICH SIMON Yeah. So, as we, and as we, as we close here--so this has been such a fascinating conversation--let's, um, in, in terms of resources, if people really want to continue their learning more about dissociation, this, your approach to trauma treatment, both reading, trading resources, trainings, what, what can we, ah, would you, can you give us some possibilities here? 

01:01:25
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Yup. Well, Rich, in terms of my writing, I've incorporated dissociation throughout my writing and, um, I now have four books that really address this: "Recollections of Sexual Abuse," published in '99. Then, ah, I have an edited book that was published in 2009 called "Treating Complex Trauma Disorders," and, um, I re-published "Healing the Incest Wound," in 2010. 

01:01:50
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

01:01:50
CHRISTINE COURTOIS And this year I-- 

01:01:50
RICH SIMON Which I read in, in 1990? "Incest Wound." 

01:01:55
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Yeah. 

01:01:55
RICH SIMON Okay. 

01:02:00
CHRISTINE COURTOIS It's 2010, and it incorporates a lot of this material. And then this year I will be publishing a book called "Treating Complex Trauma," um, with Julian Ford, um, that will have a lot of this material, um, interwoven. I have a chapter called "Into the Void," and the, um, no pun intended, the avoidance of these clients creates a void and the therapist is invited into the void to try to make sense of what the client's experience is. So those are my personal writings. Um, there's an internet-- 

01:02:30
RICH SIMON And your, your website is--and all these are listed on your website. And how do people access your website? And I, I think-- 

01:02:35
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Website is doctor Chris Courtois dot com. 

01:02:40
RICH SIMON And, there's a, so there's also on the network or, ah-- 

01:02:45
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Yes. 

01:02:45
RICH SIMON Fulfillment page for this webcast. I'm sorry. Go ahead. 

01:02:50
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Okay, and, um, there's an international society for the study of dissociation and trauma, the I.S.S.T.D. 

01:02:55
RICH SIMON Um-hum. 

01:03:00
CHRISTINE COURTOIS Um, which has a website. And one of the things that society has done very effectively is provide training modules. And you can be in training for a nine-month period of time, um, two and a half hours a month of selected readings and training with a very, um, ah, experienced, um, faculty. And I think it cost 300 dollars. It's, it's a very inexpensive training and you get a very complete training package of materials, um, having to do with dissociation and the dissociative clients and some of the techniques that we haven't talked about today. So there are different levels in that training from, ah, elementary to more experienced. And also, if anybody who's working with dissociative children, there is a special course on, on dealing with the dissociative child and adolescent. Um, and then there are a whole range of books on dissociation, um, that are available so, um, individuals can go to I.S.S.T.D. or just start researching. There's a considerable amount at this point. 

01:04:00
RICH SIMON Okay. Well a lot more than when you started 30 years ago, isn't it? 

01:04:05
