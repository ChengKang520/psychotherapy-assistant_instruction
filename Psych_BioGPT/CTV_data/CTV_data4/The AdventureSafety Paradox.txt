PAT LOVE Hi, I'm Dr. Pat Love of Pat Love & Associates, a licensed marriage and family therapist, clinical member and long-time standing approved Supervisor in American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy and a Relationship Consultant in private practice. So we're going to talk about something very different. We're gonna talk about that adventure safety paradox in sexuality because often times there is a big, uh, tension. There is a tension between the camps that believe. Well, if you want to have great sex, if you want to be in the sexual relationship, you have to have more closeness, and connection, and talking, and touching. Then there is the other camp that says, yes, but it has to be exciting, it has to be passionate, it has to be an adventure. So I want to talk about this in a little bit of a paradoxical way, but to look at both camps. And by the way, this is just what we looked at when Jo Robinson and I asked 1,500 individuals and couples, quite sometime ago, to tell us the answer to this question. What creates passion in long term relationships? It's often very easy to have passion in the beginning of a relationship, but then the healthy love relationship, when sex is truly in bounds, what is a healthy passionate relationship look like? And it was quite interesting, what they told us were the ingredients of a passionate relationship. And it's probably no surprise that we got lots of different answers and the answers represented this safety versus adventure paradox. So let's take a look at the, uh, the healthy sexual relationship and what it looks like to you? If you think about, okay, what would a healthy love relationship look like to me. In fact, that's a really good question to ask your clients, because if you want to make a change, you have to know what you're striving for, what you're looking forward to, what are your goals, what are the goals of the relationship. So what is a healthy sexual relationship look like to you? I could ask an individual that. I could ask my couple. When I worked with, with couples as well as individuals, I have a very simple model. And it's three Cs, contract, causality, congruence. And the first thing I do, I say, how can I help and whatever the clients tell me, and again I make, make it a positive measurable specific PMS. I say what would it look like if you left here saying, wow, that was worth the time, money and effort. What would you, what would you leave with? What would be different? And that that becomes the contract. And then I look for what causes them not to have it. And then I try to bring them into congruence. So if I said to my couple, how, what does a healthy love relationship look like to you? I would want to get very specific. And what these couple said when we began interviewing them, they said, first of all, it has a lot to do with desire. We all want to be desired. One of the reasons why we like to be desired is you don't have to be vulnerable. Somebody already desires you, sort of, like, you're in the catbird seat, you're in control when somebody desires you. Because in a way, it takes a big risk to desire someone, doesn't it? Because if you desire someone or something, you can get rejected, you have to put yourself out there. So I think this is a very important question. And desire can mean a lot of different things to different people. So you might have to ask your clients, well, what does that mean to you? What is that, what do you mean by desire? It could be the desire or motivation for sexual intimacy. Desires what usually prompts me to initiate sex with my partner or to even pleasure myself. Uh, but it's, you can have a desire for sexual intimacy, but that is a little different, isn't it, than the desire for your partner or for one another because desire for a partner can be relationship dependent. So this, then it starts to get a little more complex. What is it? So if you want to think of that, those three steps, contract, causality, congruence, if you want to be desirous, you want to have desire for your partner then I might ask the question, what can you do that creates desire in yourself and desire for your partner. What is it that your partner does that turns you on, that creates desire? And by the way, when I ask these questions, I get you, if you two are the couple, I get you to tell your partner, tell your partner what it is that she does that turns you on, that makes you one initiate sex, that makes you want to move closer. And so I… And I take time, and then I watch your reaction. And I say, did you know you could put that look on her face just by telling her that, did you know that when you clean up the kitchen and make sure everything is in its in place, that that's a turn on for her. You know, so I start using, brining them into congruence with what they say they want. Spontaneous interest in engaging in sexual experience. Some people walk around with a body sex ready. It doesn't take much for them just to ignite that desire into simulation and arousal. And they're on their way to orgasm. But others, they know… they don't have this ongoing physical arousal or they could be aroused, but don't have desire. And for specially, for a lot of women, they can, they can be lubricated, they could be ready for sex, but they don't desire their partner 'cause the relationship may not be in the right place. And for estrogen dominant men, it can be the same way. They need that closeness, that connection to have the desire to desire. And what's… What I often tell people who feel despondent because it's like, I used to feel this, what… I used to feel sexual desire, I used to feel that chemistry, I used to want to have sex, I used to be motivated and I say, all you have to have is the desire to desire. But remember, you've got to know what ignites your desire. You can't expect your partner to know if you're not, if you don't know and are will, aren't willing to share that with him or her. Creating the context for arousal. Remember, old messages, old experiences are highly susceptible to context. And so you might have to set the scene. For half of the population, most men and some men don't matter about setting the scene, the house can be a mess, you know, if the bed is unmade or you can have sex in the kitchen, you know. But the other half of the population, you know, a great deal of men and most women, it is, you have to create the context. So we want it, we want to really give permission for the, for understanding people in a wider context around what ignites desire. But ultimately, we've got to make it positive measurable and specific. We got to get down to the specifics of what may or may not, by the way, lead to orgasm. You know, my personal opinion is everyone should be responsible for his or her own orgasm. If I want one, I'll let you know. But I have to know what leads me there, what brings me there. And I have to be responsible for some of that knowledge. And remember what work, what works today may not work in a year or two years or three years or fifteen down the road. So you've got to keep updating your knowledge, but this is what the couples said. They said you somehow have to understand how to create desire in yourself and desire in your partner. The second part of this adventure piece of passion is technique. What do I mean by technique? Techniques are the behaviors activities that you use. What specifically do you do that arouses you? You know, is it something, is it fantasy, is it, uh, an intimate encounter with one another, is it, uh, having a clean shower and feeling good about yourself, is it dressing in a sexy outfit, umm… is it reading a romance novel, is it reliving a past sexual experience with your partner, what is that arouses you? Because as, as I mentioned, you've got to understand the technique which tells you how you got there. And then you have to understand the behaviors and activities you use to arouse your partner. Now generally speaking, most techniques when we think of what two people are doing when they're having sex. Most techniques, if you're not careful favor the male orgasm. They don't favor the female orgasm. Males need more of a thrusting motion. Females are more of a circular teasing motion. I mean, those are just two of, of many, many, many differences. And so you have to know what techniques, what positions, what context, what foreplay it is that arouses you and arouses your partner. So you got to know what turns you on. And again, what… in this… I want to normalize this, and because a big part of our role when we're working around sexual issues is to normalize behavior. Because what technique works for you today is very likely not gonna work for you five years from now or ten years from now. Let me just give you an example of that. For many women, sexual penetration releases Oxytocin, which gives you a flood of pleasure, makes you feel close, bonded, snug, makes you want to snug or move, you know, be protective, it's that bonding chemical. So early in your life and it has a lot to do with musculature, you know, and, and a young age and tightness and tautness. So early in the life, just penetration gives you a surge of pleasure. Well, later, as muscles relax and aging occurs, it takes more than that. And most, for most women, an orgasm has to include clitoral stimulation. But if you don't know that and you're not using a position that favors that, you're probably not gonna to get pleasure. And if a female is not… or a male is not reaching organism their incentive for sex goes way down, doesn't it? So you have to use and choose techniques that favor the orgasm of each partner. Many as ways this is why same sex couples have great sex, is they understand the body and techniques of the other. And so this idea of technique, it's, it's the nuts and bolts, it really is the technicalities, what position, what types of touching, what types of activities turn you on and arouse you, as well as your partner. Then there is romance and this is, this is a big one, simple definition of romance is proof positive, you care for me. Proof positive, that you're interested in putting me in the mood, you know. Proof positive, that you're doing your part to arouse me. And see, romance, you have to play to your audience, because what is romantic to me, may not be romantic to my partner, you know. And there is, there is primitive longing, well, I want you to want just what I want, and because that's easy to give, because it's easy to know. But you have to be in a way, altruistic, in relationships, it's not just do unto others as you would have them do unto you, do unto others as they would want you to do. And so again, you have to go beyond your own subjective experience and be generous, that's why generosity is such a strong predictor of happiness and stability in relationships. Can you, in fact, let me just give you one little research piece, I always love it when research pops in my brain. If, uh… if you like movies and I like movies, we both love movies and I call you and say, oh, I got us tickets to, you know, Ex Machina and it just came out and we're gonna go see it. You know, well, that's, I get points for that, 'cause I know, you like movies. But truth is, I also like movies. But if I don't like movies, you know, and they actually overwhelm me and I just can hardly stand to go, but I know you've been waiting for this movie to come out. And I sacrifice myself not only to get in line and get the tickets and make sure, you know, I got the right seats that you like and everything, but I go with you because I know you enjoy it more if I'm along. That giving to you at a cost to me, correlates with commitment and happiness in relationships, isn't that interesting? So it's sacrificing, it's beyond altruism, it's sacrificing, I give it at a cost, because pleasing you is that important to me, that's romantic. You talk to about romantic, that goes a long, long way. And that, talk about the sealing, the commitment and the happiness in relationship, that is a big one, that's a big one, so that's romance. Variety is so important because what's novel today is familiar tomorrow. This is why it's so easy to get hooked on a new partner, or a new relationship, or new affair, or a, or pornography, or pros…different prostitutes, or just a new chat room, that mean… because novelty wakes up your brain. Anything new, you know, how do you, I mean… I once read a book by Faith Popcorn, who is a futurist and, and they said, what are the challenges of the future in marketing? And she says how to get someone who has 72 blouses to buy a blouse. So well, how do you get someone who has 72 blouses to buy about blouse, she said, you got to make it personal, you got to make it personal. And that is so important because what, what you got to get it novel, and you've got it to stand out and you got to make it personal. So the variety can't just be something new, but it's something new that I think you would like. Because you've got to keep having the willingness and courage to add creativity and novelty to your love making but if you're gonna move, move in a direction that the risk is for you, not your partner. Again, you got to play to your audience. So the risk has to be for me. The various ways you and your partner make love. This is what variety is all about, okay. Now, there is nothing like pure passion and what am I talking about? The willingness and courage to combine intense feelings of arousal with sex. You know, some people are, are erotophi… have a erotophilia, others have erotophobia. Some people are very comfortable with sex. Some people are very insecure, private, and little bit afraid of sex. So you've got to take a risk to be able to let yourself go and abandon yourself and just rock at sex, that passionate, passionate way of living. And the key to that, by the way, is living a passionate life, period. So that's, sort of, the adventure side, but there is always another voice, isn't there? In order to be adventuresome and passionate with my partner, there has to be safety. And the safety comes with listening, showing interest, caring, understanding, acting congruently. Boy, that's a big one. You know how to build trust? Here's three steps to building trust, say what you're gonna do, do it, repeat steps one and two. I mean, that's exactly how you build safety. And it base on being able to talk and communicate about sex, you got to be able to talk about it. But it's not just sex, it's sensuality, can you let your whole body enjoy sex? Can you, can you manage your fear or your embarrassment around being naked or, or just vulnerable and, and to let your whole body enjoy it. I mean, to be touched, can you feel the touch when you're touched, using all your senses? Setting the scene, that's so important to a big part of the population. This emotional regulation, if you look at agreeableness, and kindness, and emotional regulation, those are the three strongest predictors of a happy stable relationship, agreeableness, kindness and emotional regulation. And you've got to be able to mange and express emotions in a respectful manner. So what are we really talking about here? We're talking about creating safety. And I want to give you an exercise because if you don't know how to create safety with couples, you're not gonna be able to manage sexual difficulties. So I'm gonna take you through a little guided imagery. And in the guided imagery, I'm gonna ask you to anchor a feeling. So I want to explain what anchoring is. And, uh… you want to choose a…. anchor is a physic…physical sign of an internal state, okay? And I want you to choose an anchor, here is the one I use, I usually use pushing my index finger and my thumb together, 'cause first of all if you do that, nobody get alarmed, no one thinks you're funny, you know, if you do that. It can be something simple as just, you know, closing your fingers, but I want you to think about an anchor that you will use in the future, 'cause I'm gonna take you through a guided imagery that helps you create safety. I use this with individuals. And I use it with couples. And if you're gonna do any type of work around emotional regulation or sexuality or especially when you have a breach and, and a threat in a relationship, around going out of bounds you have got to be able to create safety in this couple. You've got to have a safety queue, so that if either person feels threatened or vulnerable, you can call time, and take time to anchor yourself in safety. So let's start this. I'm gonna ask you just to sit as comfortable as you can, people usually like to, put your feet flat on the floor and just as you began to just relax and let the chair hold you, I'm gonna ask you to close your eyes. And just as you close your eyes, begin to focus on the sounds around you. And with each and every sound that you hear, just remind yourself to let go, relax, and feel safe, and comfortable. And as a way of relaxing and going deeper into a relaxed state, I invite you to take a deep breath in through your nose, just holding that breath and then exhaling slowly through your mouth, as you let go. Feeling your body relax, then moving towards a second breath, in through your nose, out of your mouth, into relaxation. And as you continue to relax, I would invite you to take one last deep breath, and exhaling, and letting that exhale relax any part of your body that needs to let go of tension, and move in to relaxation, and towards safety. And as you continue to relax, I would invite you in your minds eye, to travel to a very safe place. It may be a place you've been to before, or it may be a place that you create now, in your own image. But travel to this place, be a part of this place, see the colors of this place, the sights of this place, hear the sounds of safety, smell the smells, and feel what it's like to be safe, get relaxed, in this place. Then when you feel this relaxation, when you know I'm safe, cerate an anchor, to strengthen that feeling of safety, and press that anchor now, knowing, that every time you use this anchor, you can choose to feel the feeling of safety. Press, feel safe. Release, still safe, now press again, deeper into relaxation and safety, then release, and one last anchor, press, relax and feel safe. And as you continue to feel safe, you look around, you see the scene, you hear the sounds, you smell the smells, taste the taste, and know, here I am, in my safe place. And remind yourself, I can come back anytime I want or need to. And as you release the anchor, and prepared to leave knowing you can come back, as I count to three, just slowly open your eyes, one, becoming more aware of the room, two, slowly opening you eyes, three, looking around you, feeling safe and relaxed. Now this is a technique that I use with couples. I teach them an anchor, I give them an anchor. And if and when conflict, or fear, or shame, or defense comes up in the session, I take a moment, I encourage them to use their anchor and we practice the anchor in the session. Then as a part of homework, I tell them to practice it at home when they need it. And I ask them if any issue comes up, call time, separate, go to your safe place and then you can either, either use safe communication that I've already taught them, or you can table it, make a note and bring it back to your session with me. So one of the ways we know that create healthy relationships, yes, you're got to have adventure. You know, one size doesn't fit all. For some people, they have to feel safe to feel desire, it's just the way it works, half the population. The other half of the population, by the way, they want to have adventure to feel safe. They'd say, how can I talk to you about motions, how can we have, I have a intimate conservation when we haven't had sex in, in two weeks, you know, three days and 27 seconds. No, how can I do that? So again, one size does not fit all. You have to make sure the past doesn't spoil the present. That's why emotional regulation having the safety exercise is so important. You can feel the feeling, but you got to do the right thing. Because we know sexual behavior can go out of bounds. And couples can be derailed when one or both people go out of bounds with their sexual behavior. But you can get back on the track. And healthy relational sex includes safety, as well as adventure. Thank you all so much. And may your life be filled with passion. Thank you so much. Thank you. Are there any questions? 

00:28:00
UNKNOWN Yes. Umm… I often hear people saying they don't want to have sex with because they don't want to be attached. 

00:28:10
PAT LOVE Oh. They don't want to have sex because they want to be attached? Smart, smart reply, I think. And here, here is why that makes sense for about half of the population, not all. Most women, some men. Oxytocin triggers orgasm. And Oxytocin is that bonding chemical that makes you more monogamous, makes you feel protective, makes you want to move toward, makes you feel bonded and does increase attachment. You know, Oxytocin is released when the mother breast feeds, it makes her protective of the baby, move toward the baby, be attached to the baby. So I think that's really good advice. If you don't want to be attached to a jerk or jerkette, don't be having sex yet with them because it does promote attachment. Now let me give you the other side of that. And you think, well, why doesn't it bond so and so. You know, she is a jerkette or jerk. Testosterone offsets the effects of Oxytocin, so the hot, hot more testosterone you have, and this could be a male or a female, then it doesn't promote bonding as much as it does, if you an estrogen dominant male or an estrogen dominant female. So it probably is… First of all, it's good to be cautious to practice safe, responsible, consensual sex, but also if you don't want to be attached to someone, don't be having sex with him. Good friend, good advice. Thank you all very, very much. I really appreciate to talking with you and working with you. Thanks.
