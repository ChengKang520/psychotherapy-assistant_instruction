BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
UNKNOWN Okay, Norma, so this morning you did a session with John. 

00:00:05
NORMA Yes. 

00:00:05
UNKNOWN And, you know, demonstrating person-centered counseling - 

00:00:05
NORMA Mmm-mm. 

00:00:05
UNKNOWN - and that's what this program is about and I guess person-centered counseling is one of those approaches that most people are familiar with. 

00:00:15
NORMA And then they think they know a lot about, uhm, but in my experience, ah, there are far few people that really know about it as to those who think they know about it if that makes any sense. Uhm, and I'd like to sort of open this by just explaining that, that statement that I just made, uhm, for instance, uhm, a lot of practitioners will say in person-centered because I use the three co-conditions, empathy, unconditional positive regard and congruence and it's, it's sort of strange and we have wonderful ideas that people hope about it, it's like as if they say, ah, yeah, the person-centered, ah, counselor therapist just doesn't do much. They certainly say, mmm-mm, yes, tell me more. Uhm, they believe that the person-centered and the person-centered approach don't ask questions, ah, you don't deal with the past, uhm, that the person-centered approach is only for long-term work and it's not necessarily saw and that, ah, or perhaps some, uhm, some situations where the person-centered counselor wouldn't be, ah, effective at all and there's a certain amount of truth to that but it's, you know, there's a blanket sort of assumption that person-centered counselors and therapist don't work with people who have mental ill health. 

00:02:00
UNKNOWN Mmm-mm. 

00:02:05
NORMA You know, so there's, there's lots of sort of assumptions and they're not really based in reality. It's just, just a perception of what the person-centered approach is about. 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN So what is it about? 

00:02:20
NORMA It's, it's an approach that is to do with a certain kind of relationship with the therapist or the counselors has with his or her client. And it's been well-tested, it's a taking a long time to develop and it's continually developing and diversifying I mean it become as most people will, ah, know with Carl Rogers and his ideas took-- they did-- didn't sort of pop up from, ah, from nowhere. They, ah, you know, they were years and years of, uhm, thinking about noticing how he work with people and then trying to describe that thing in theoretical terms. Uhm, it wasn't approach that was underpinned by humanistic, uhm, philosophies from analogy and existentialism and Rogers himself wasn't an existentialist or a phenomenologist but he really took from those ideas and it was all part of the growth of the, ah, person-centered approach and it's taking on, ah, many basis if you like. It was become perhaps as reflective therapy and then non-directive therapy and he then defined, uhm, the relationship and it became client-centered therapy and as it evolves and towards the end of his life and it was applied further in a one to one relationship. It became known as the person-centered approach. 

00:04:15
UNKNOWN Mmm-mm. 

00:04:15
NORMA And it goes on since Rogers' death where, uhm, some would take his ideas and develop and others would take some of his ideas and take those off in a different, ah, direction but there is a-- this lose, uhm, some people call it tribes of the person-centered approach to lose relationship between this all and it's been interesting because it, it came to fruition in America and the times and the culture and the, the need for it. It was right at that time but it's waiting there but it's taking off through Europe and Japan, South America and it's, it's become much, much more know, ah, research there was a, a bit of a, a mystery then of what Carl Rogers said, you know the-- when you're in, uhm, a relationship with somebody, ah, you, you don't need theory. You don't need to research. I don't think he quite meant that. Ah, people take it to me that you don't need theory at all and that's, that's certainly not the, the case if that was it so you wouldn't have to research so extensively. 

00:05:40
UNKNOWN Right. We got on a quite clear theories of human development on (inaudible ). 

00:05:48
NORMA Yes, yes, yes. 

00:05:48
UNKNOWN But you also say is that person-centered therapy didn't dying with Carl Rogers but it carried on growing and developing. 

00:05:55
NORMA No, no. He greatly, greatly influenced it and not just, you know, the person-centered world but so called co-conditions co-- co-- sort of conduct phrase the attitudinal qualities then the counselor, the therapist qualities they are within most major therapeutic approaches. They would be seen to be necessary but they're not seen as sufficient so that perhaps they would use those co-conditions to be empathic and, ah, opened and non-judgmental as a basis to, uhm, to work further with the client. 

00:06:45
UNKNOWN Okay. Let me get really sure I got this right because what I'm hearing is that those co-conditions-- we'll come back to talk about those and, uhm, maybe part of a lot of different therapies approach not different approaches who recognized the importance of it as they said. 

00:07:00
NORMA Yes, yes. 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN But that doesn't mean they're actually being person-centered - 

00:07:05
NORMA No, no. 

00:07:05
UNKNOWN - it just mean they're using some part of it. 

00:07:05
NORMA Yes, yes. 

00:07:10
UNKNOWN Do you wanna talk a bit about what are the co-conditions are, does that makes sense to do? 

00:07:15
NORMA Uhm, yeah, that would be helpful I think because if the person-centered approaches largely known for the co-conditions but actually it's not ought when Rogers was defining the kind of therapeutic relationship between the therapist and the counselor. He didn't named three conditions. 

00:07:35
UNKNOWN Mmm. 

00:07:35
NORMA He actually named six and they, they sort of disappeared and particularly the first and the six but in current literature authors have come back to relook and to bring the six back together and, uhm, the first one would be that the client and the therapist, the counselor are in psychological contact, you know, we're not talking of sort of, you know, deep psychological contact is that you and I have in a way unless of each other in the room that we're about to do some work together. And the second one is that the client is in congruent. If he or she has probably come to part of their lives where they are noticing that what is happening for them inside is really not how they're presenting to everybody else and then somewhat inside their own self. 

00:08:40
UNKNOWN So that's them in congruent. 

00:08:45
NORMA That's their in congruent. 

00:08:45
UNKNOWN How would I look to the outside world is not how I feel inside, yeah? 

00:08:45
NORMA Yeah, yeah. 

00:08:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:08:50
NORMA And then the third would be that the counselor, the therapist is integrated and congruent within the relationship that he or she doesn't wear a facade is I guess what, what you see is what you get, you know, they're open and honest within that relationship. 

00:09:10
UNKNOWN Transparently real. 

00:09:10
NORMA Yes, yes. 

00:09:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:09:10
NORMA Absolutely, nice way of saying it and then the next condition is that, uhm, therapist, the counselor offers unconditional positive regard to the client I mean, her way about that client presents on whatever he or she presents and fifth is that the, uhm, they offer empathic understanding of the client's frame of reference. You see it through the client's eyes, yeah. And that they make it known empathy I guess it's an empathy of its in the therapist head. It actually help to make it known. 

00:09:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:09:55
NORMA Yeah, and the last one is that the, the client perceives to a certain extent therapists unconditional positive regard with then-- under empathic understanding and that unless that happens no matter how empathic, no matter how accepting therapist believes themselves to be. If the client isn't getting it, it just not-- it's just not working. 

00:10:25
UNKNOWN And he talk in terms of if they are in place. 

00:10:25
NORMA Yeah. 

00:10:25
UNKNOWN Then change will take place. 

00:10:30
NORMA Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN And that six-one, ah, is maybe the key to that it's the clients awareness of those conditions that makes the difference. 

00:10:40
NORMA Yeah. Well he suggests as well it's-- I mean, he, he wrote it, you know, ah, to define the relationship within the, ah, person-centered approach but he suggested that it could happened in any therapeutic approach. It could happened in a friendship relationship. 

00:11:00
UNKNOWN Mmm. 

00:11:00
NORMA But it's likely maximum within a therapeutic relationship. 

00:11:05
UNKNOWN So we have those conditions in place. 

00:11:10
NORMA Yup. 

00:11:10
UNKNOWN But Rogers also explained why they work, why they're effective. 

00:11:15
NORMA Yeah, yeah. He suggested that if you offer a certain kind of, ah, relationship to the client it might and if they want to work with it reverse, uhm, that congruence which occurred as a result of an earlier relationship or relationships and he has quite, uhm, ah, a sophisticated, ah, theory to explain that and it might be helpful if I just sort of - 

00:11:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

00:11:50
NORMA - talk a little bit about that. Uhm, one of the, the main planks if you like, one of the main concepts the person-centered approach is that of the actual losing tendency that's over innate, ah, tendency to become what we were meant to be, you know, it's ongoing it never stops, ah, it's prosocial, it's creative and, and I think that can actually stop it until the person dies but in a person's life it can be blocked, it can be trotted and it can be trotted through unfavorable conditions. It could be that it's environmental conditions but what Rogers looks at most to the other conditions within the early and later relationships. Uhm, that might lead, uhm, the client to actualize in-- he or she will always actualize but will actualize in accordance to the conditions that are placed on them. 

00:13:05
UNKNOWN Okay, okay. 

00:13:10
NORMA Is that make sense? 

00:13:10
UNKNOWN I'm reminded, I think, I'm reminded potatoes in the salad that Rogers - 

00:13:15
NORMA Oh yes. 

00:13:15
UNKNOWN - as a young man saw potatoes growing kind of left in the cellar of his parents' house. 

00:13:20
NORMA Yes, yeah. 

00:13:20
UNKNOWN And they will kind to do the best job they could of being a potato plant. 

00:13:25
NORMA Yeah. I'm sending it, sort of with it - 

00:13:30
UNKNOWN Yes, yes. 

00:13:30
NORMA - and great shoots, you know. 

00:13:30
UNKNOWN So their conditions were very poor in order to be potatoes. 

00:13:35
NORMA Yes. Yeah. And human lives are in certain circumstances quite impoverished as well and they might start the actuating tendency. 

00:13:45
UNKNOWN It's still yes? 

00:13:50
NORMA It's still, it's still moves on. 

00:13:50
UNKNOWN Okay, so what happens? 

00:13:55
NORMA Uhm, the actuating tendency is blocked by what Rogers terms of conditions of work that is the, uhm, the expectations that of this place on us as children as you know, growing children as we come adults in society places on Earth. And conditions of it say you were only valuable, you are only lovable, you are only acceptable if you do what we tell you, if you do what we expect to you and it's not all, you know, it's not always abusive conditions of work can be quite benign and but what happens is that a child, the adult needs the positive regard of others and will sabotage and dismiss their own value of themselves to gain the level of affection of another and so they, they envied if you like, they-- they're taking other people's conditions of work they become what others want them to be like the expense of their own experience of their own world, uhm, develop what Rogers, ah, terms us an external Locus of Evaluation. 

00:15:20
UNKNOWN So someone else decides by my behavior whether I'm good or not. 

00:15:25
NORMA Yes, yes. 

00:15:25
UNKNOWN So I'm, I'm wondering about parents in how they would feel with this news that you have a child careering around the house and you tend to stop making so much noise - 

00:15:40
NORMA Yes. 

00:15:40
UNKNOWN - or not to hit the piano with the hammer or with that mop. 

00:15:45
NORMA Well, I think it's a natural thing if you see your child ready to tumble down the stairs. You know, you're not gonna say, can you stop here and have a conversation, you know, and absolutely move, move into a counseling role you just go and you hold on to that child (inaudible ) 

00:16:04
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah. 

00:16:05
NORMA But I guess it's, it's-- if it's continued over years, over years, over years and those conditions of work also include the judgment, ah, uhm, I will not review unless you do this, ah, you know, and that there is such a need within the child, within the person to, to gain the love of the other to being noticed, to be accepted, ah, that they will give up, you know, that's a little girl, you know, daddy just made spaghetti bolognese for her and she sits down and she eats it, you know, I don't like this dad. You eat it. I spent all morning cooking this for you. You'll eat it. But daddy the spaghetti taste like worms. You're a bad girl. If you don't eat that and perhaps worn out dad is absolute worn out, yeah, and you know, this is, is-- he's just frustrated but if that kind of message keeps on being put unto the child I think I don't want to be a bad girl for daddy. I want to eat my food even though I can't stand the taste of it and it feels like warms my mouth. So that saddens me again. 

00:17:35
UNKNOWN So more and more my value isn't decided by me - 

00:17:40
NORMA Yeah. 

00:17:40
UNKNOWN - it's decided by dad - 

00:17:40
NORMA Yes, yes. 

00:17:40
UNKNOWN - because it's so important for me to be loved. 

00:17:45
NORMA Yes, yeah. 

00:17:45
UNKNOWN To be valued. 

00:17:45
NORMA I mean, in that process I will look after my dad. 

00:17:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:17:50
NORMA I will make sure that he's not going to be upset and he's done so much for me. He spent all day cooking this food and I'm such a naughty girl for, you know, disliking it. 

00:18:00
UNKNOWN So that child grows up and in the sense we all have an element of our conditions of what's being decided by an external locus evaluation to an extent but depending on that extent that will be problematic or not problematic. 

00:18:25
NORMA Yes, and I think it's the extent to that and so I understand that, that goes on to the possibility of psychological disturbance, you know, because in the process of the child living up to the expectations of others he or she becomes in congruent, yeah. 

00:18:45
UNKNOWN The feeling inside doesn't match how I present myself outside. 

00:18:50
NORMA Yes, yeah. 

00:18:50
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:18:50
NORMA And that keeps on being buried and buried. Yeah, and it's the therapeutic relationship that is offered to the very start if I as a therapist can be totally accepting our work to be totally accepting of you, if I can understand you from your frame, see you through your lens not my lens so I can therefore to do that and be consistent in that over a period of time then if you want, if that's what you want, you know, in this relationship we can reverse that and you might be able then to become more congruent with yourself to be able to express those feelings that have always been buried to be able to, yeah, not turned to me to be the expert on you. I will refuse as the therapist to be an expert about your life. You are the expert on your life. I'm just trying to understand it. I'm asking would you let me in to your life? 

00:20:15
UNKNOWN Okay. So we've start of with those co-conditions which the therapist offers the client and they are offered in a way that then allows remedial work to take place as the client experience is something different from the original external locus of evaluation. 

00:20:35
NORMA Yeah, yeah, and it's the, it's that-- it's experience throughout that perhaps the (inaudible ) the therapeutic (inaudible ) but continually through the relationship as well that, that is, uhm, whatever you bring, whatever you present it I'm willing as a therapist to understand it to and enter relationship with you, I'm not gonna use my unconditional positive regard on my empathic understanding with the strategy or the skill, what I want to be is in relationship with you an empathic, non-judgmental congruent relationship with you. 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN So it's not about technique? 

00:21:30
NORMA No, uhm, it's not offering so that you will change it's just offering the relationship and if you want too in that you can change. It might seem that there's can only happened long to him. Ah, in my experience that sometimes in a very short space of time uhm, if I can trust that, ah, a client has the capacity to change all I have to do is to provide a certain kind of relationship and trust that they will use it in whatever way they wish and change what happened. I don't use the co-conditions so that you will change. I just offer a relationship. 

00:22:25
UNKNOWN Going back to potatoes it's kind of here the ideal medium for you to grow in? 

00:22:35
NORMA Mmm-mm. 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN Yeah, out in the field, rain and sunshine, air ah, that's the idea and it feels like you're talking about again offering the ideal conditions to be whatever you can be. 

00:22:50
NORMA Yeah. Oh my-- and you know, realistic terms this is for me to be in that kind of relationship to be real and to be accepting and to see the world through the client's eye for me to become congruent and accepting of that I have to be very aware of myself, my own conditions of work, my own prejudices, the, the times where I miss what the client is saying I just can't hear it or I won't hear it or I don't want to hear it and I breakaway for one reason or the other from being in relationship. So I always as I'm working with my client I'm also aware of what's going on inside of me and how that is affecting the relationship that we have. 

00:23:50
UNKNOWN So what your reminded of is long, long time ago when you said to me that you are going to work solely for person-centered perspective - 

00:24:05
NORMA Yeah. 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN - after a number of years of working for, ah, a more integrated approach. 

00:24:10
NORMA Mmm, mmm. 

00:24:10
UNKNOWN Ah, and for a lot of people thinking person-centered approach, ah, it feels like it's very simple, ah, and - 

00:24:20
NORMA Yeah. 

00:24:20
UNKNOWN - it may be simple to understand but actually what they're talking about is how difficult it is because of how much of you-- your bringing-- well, certainly you have much of you, you are bringing you into that. 

00:24:35
NORMA Sure. And as much as I need to trust the client I have to trust myself as well because that's what I do I bring me into this relationship, you know, and so that there is a, a meeting. There is, ah, a meeting between two people, yeah, and when I become this venture, uhm, it was from reading a chapter that Rogers co-wrote it written in on becoming a person and as I read it I thought, oh my goodness, he knows. He knows what I'm doing because I have been working intuitively if you like, towards the person-centered approach, I didn't know. I really didn't know. Uhm, and he defined it. He says, look, this is, this is theory. There are thousands of people that are practicing like you and there was that bit of it which was really certain thing I wasn't alone anymore but there was also that somebody knows me. It was that sense of being in relationship with somebody else. 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN So it was very special for you? 

00:25:55
NORMA Yeah, it was, it was and it took a while to sort of risk, uhm, moving away from something that I was pretty good at actually and it worked and I, uhm, talk about it was my supervisor and she says, well, if you're making this move you need to find yourself a person-centered supervisor who will, uhm, you know, be with you as you make this move and that's what I did, ah, because I was fearful of, you know, if I'm changing this-- there might be times when I got experiment or trying something different and (inaudible ), you know, the start. How can I remain ethical and professional once I'm changing my therapeutic approach so this, uhm, the supervisor that I work with for quite a long time was so helpful in that, so facilitative, you know, and help me to begin the process which I continue now which is to reflect, reflect on the relationship but specifically on me within that on how I might block the attitudinal qualities and you know, we talk about what person-centered, ah, theory isn't earlier on and one of the other assumption is very passive and I work my socks off and I think it's one of the most challenging things that I have ever done in my life, uhm, because being in relationship is tough. 

00:28:00
UNKNOWN Uhm. 

00:28:00
NORMA It's tough. 

00:28:00
UNKNOWN It's easier to do things. 

00:28:05
NORMA Yes. 

00:28:05
UNKNOWN It's easier to have, ah, sort of repertoire... 

00:28:05
NORMA So easier for me and like-- I can't speak for everybody I mean, I'm-- you know, in speaking to both my development I'm not decrying anybody and anybody else of therapeutic approach, ah, but for me I was a good doer. I could do things. I could help client solved their problems, ah, that was my family role. 

00:28:30
UNKNOWN Mmm-mm. 

00:28:35
NORMA And so just to rely on me being good enough on me being in relationship and really, really trust that it was the client who knew far better than I of what was wrong, very expert on their lives. I'm, I'm just, you know, I'm just an onlooker in, invite it into that. 

00:28:55
UNKNOWN Just thinking about that they, they are the expert of their lives - 

00:29:00
NORMA Yeah. 

00:29:00
UNKNOWN - I'm thinking about the in congruence that you're told about before on, on the surface while there's also problem the difference, the distance between what it feels like inside and it feels like outside maybe as well the problem, right, so where the clue to what's happening to me lies. 

00:29:20
NORMA Yeah, yeah, cuz it's very little that they're gonna feel when they, when they begin their therapy there are counseling that they are expert on anything, you know, that will not be their sense on themselves, about themselves. 

00:29:35
UNKNOWN So unco-- much early on you were talking about the non-directional elements - 

00:29:40
NORMA Yes. 

00:29:40
UNKNOWN - of person-centered therapy - 

00:29:45
NORMA Yeah. 

00:29:45
UNKNOWN - and that's still there, I guess. 

00:29:45
NORMA Uhm, it all depends what aspect the person-centered work you look it at. 

00:29:50
UNKNOWN This is a tribes. 

00:29:55
NORMA Yes. Yeah, because some have become what I would considered to be more directional and that they will invite the, the client to, ah, perhaps in strategies I think of different things that they might do to move away entirely from the, you know, the here or now moment. I work as I guess a classic client-centered practitioner and for me to be directional with my, uhm, with my clients would mean that I would be interfering with the actuating tendency and it's not as I mentioned earlier when I am, ah, being impassive and accepting and congruent. I'm not using those as strategy. I wouldn't be non-directional just to use it as a strategy. It's, it's something that's much more principled for me. It's a, you know, and it's something that I have to reflect on quite deeply, uhm, sometimes I can spot it if I nudge - 

00:31:05
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:31:05
NORMA - the client or pull them along a little bit faster than I think or point they serve it on you know, and, uhm, sometimes I can spot it and I can say, okay, let's work with this but sometimes it's so subtle I think you can, you can miss it. You can miss how you're going to... 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN And if-- that what you're doing here, right? 

00:31:30
NORMA Yeah. And those are the instances perhaps that I need to look at, ah, within supervision. 

00:31:35
UNKNOWN Cuz the moment that you are starting to nudge or guide you are becoming the experts - 

00:31:45
NORMA Yes. 

00:31:45
UNKNOWN - on what the client needs rather than the client being the expert on what they need. 

00:31:45
NORMA Yes, yeah, yeah. So that it's, it's quite demanding I think to, to be aware of it all the times - 

00:31:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:31:55
NORMA - and its certainties. 

00:31:55
UNKNOWN I feel like its also quite demanding, ah, to untangle the bits of you where you might find yourself thinking what they need is and actually to put that to one side and trust in the process of providing this environment when they will find what I needed. 

00:32:20
NORMA Yeah. It is one of the biggest challenges I have and then what mood from being and then to create practitioner to work more person-centered in that what work from a perfectly well in the first that, that couldn't be you know, that couldn't be in the person-centered approach, you know. 

00:32:45
UNKNOWN So you had to put those two walls to one side. 

00:32:45
NORMA But it's like it's my default. This, this perhaps a little voice that says, "Oh, my. What about trying this?" And it's, ah, little siren calls, no, this is what I'm deeply, you know, what I'm aware of it and (inaudible ) in the, in the moment but it's usually superficial when I find the, the more subtle nudges. 

00:33:15
UNKNOWN Right. Because, ah, not back to the need to have an awareness of yourself - 

00:33:20
NORMA Yes. 

00:33:20
UNKNOWN - within the relationship with your (inaudible ) 

00:33:24
NORMA Yes, yeah. How to work 

00:33:25
UNKNOWN That sounds it. 

00:33:25
NORMA Worth it. 

00:33:30
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:33:30
NORMA Okay. 

00:33:30
UNKNOWN Thank you very much.
