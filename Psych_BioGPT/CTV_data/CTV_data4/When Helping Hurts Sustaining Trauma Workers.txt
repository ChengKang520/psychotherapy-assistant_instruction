FRANK OCHBERG  Hello, I'm Frank Ochberg, and I'm delighted to host this fourth in a series of films by Gift From Within, the only charity in the world for people with Posttraumatic stress disorder. And this charity is also interested and those of us who worked with traumatized people, who worked with victims ah, in America, in, in the cities, in the rural areas whether we are firefighters, police, journalists, doctors, nurses, therapists, all of us share some special vulnerabilities and some special risks. We can develop a form of posttraumatic stress ourselves. We can through empathy, ah, through our own compassion, we can become ah, a damaged. We can hurt. We can suffer and sometimes, we don't even know what's happening to ourselves. That's what this is about. 

00:01:05
WHEN HELPING HURTS Sustaining Trauma Workers Dedicated to trauma workers worldwide 

00:01:05
FRANK OCHBERG  Compassion fatigue is a relatively new term. It's the negative effects. It's the deleterious effects that those of us who work with people who have been seriously traumatized. Those of us who work with these people feel ourselves. Ah, it could be a, ah, a sudden nightmare or flashback of something that resembles posttraumatic stress disorder, or it could be insidious, gradually becoming hard and cynical and losing our sense of humor. It, it could be a sense of demoralization because some of the things that we tackle are so enormous and they're not gonna change or we are going to have suffering in this world and in our lifetimes. And every once in a while, particularly those of us who are new at this, and I, idealistically have a very, very strong feelings, feel frustrated. 

00:02:15
Who is the Trauma Worker? 

00:02:15
FRANK OCHBERG  I just celebrate the fact that we are so different, and we're all over the world. We are, we are firefighters who have, perhaps, haven't had a psychology course where psychologist who may have never had the, ah, the opportunity to physically rescue and somebody and save a life. Where journalists who cover battles and crime and victims and disasters all over the world and who think we have thick skins but, but suffer. Police are trauma workers. Nurses in hospitals are trauma workers. Morgue attendants are trauma workers and even those people behind the scenes, the administrators, the secretaries, the receptionists who are willing to work in some of the most demanding difficult jobs, and they, and they are subject to the abuse of people who are angry and frustrated. All of us are trauma workers. 

00:03:15
FRANK OCHBERG  Ah, let me mention a few special categories of trauma workers. First of all, the Red Cross. I, I've been privileged, and my wife has also to be Red Cross volunteers, very different kind of worker is, is the police officer who particularly the one who deals in a large city and who doesn't necessarily get the respect and the, the acknowledgement that he or she deserves. They're dealing with crime and drugs and poverty, and it's easy to lose sight of why you came into the force in the first place and to feel somewhat hard and cynical. It, it's a stretch to call it compassion fatigue, because the compassion is, is what may run out, ah, and yet, ah, these are people who serve, and they are part of the fraternity and a sorority of, of trauma workers. And there are chaplains and clergymen, rabbis and priests. 

00:04:25
FRANK OCHBERG Ah, a colleague of mine named Andrew Weaver has been writing and researching and teaching, ah, about the importance of the clergy as the front line in dealing with trauma. More people who are bereaved, more people who are suddenly just knocked out of their traces are gonna talk to their own clergyman, their own pastor, then we'll talk, ah, to a psychologist or psychiatrist. So, so we need to recognize each other's strengths, each other's skills, and, and also each other's capacity for suffering. 

00:05:00
What is Compassion Fatigue? Compassion Stress/Secondary Traumatization Burnout Countertransference Reactions Charles Figley, Ph.D. 

00:05:00
CHARLES FIGLEY  Primary stress disorder, of course, is when you're in harm's way and you, you potentially become a victim and become traumatized as a result of that. Secondary traumatic stress reactions like compassion stress is really the secondary effects of helping people who are in harm's way. So, compassion fatigue really is the fatigue of compassion, the fatigue of trying to help the suffering of a feeling that you stand in the way, ah, of this person's recovery process and that therefore, you are responsible for that person's recovery process. So, compassion stress is really the, the stress that we feel. We feel it in our mind. We feel it in our body when we are trying to help and especially after we help. And I've talked about this in another context, compassion that compassions trapped then is doing the best that you can of being empathic, of become caring and, and feeling the pain of another person and doing the right thing as a result of that. The compassion stress is not being able to let it go. 

00:06:15
What is Compassion Fatigue? Compassion Stress/Secondary Traumatization Burnout Countertransference Reactions Mary Beth Williams, Ph.D., LCSW 

00:06:15
MARY BETH WILLIAMS  With compassion fatigue, vicarious traumatization to me it isn't that you don't wanna do the job that you're doing, but the job itself impacts you, the clients impact you, the stories impact you, the conditions impact you, just as a matter of course. And again, referring back to Charles Figley, he has said that it's much easier to recover from compassion fatigue than it is from burnout, 'cause many times with compassion fatigue, you need a break or you need to do something to balance yourself. You need to deal with colleagues and have some fun and or, or just something, and you rejuvenate particularly if you like doing what you do. Ah, were with burnout, you're kind of at the point where you don't like doing what you're doing, and you're just doing you're slogging along. 

00:07:05
What is Compassion Fatigue? Compassion Stress/Secondary Traumatization Burnout Countertransference Reactions John P. Wilson, Ph.D. 

00:07:05
JOHN P. WILSON  Countertransference reactions are very expectable phenomenon. They refer to feelings and thoughts and behaviors that occur in the helper during the process of helping as well as later when they're outside the context of their work. The helper begins to feel overwhelmed by what they're hearing and seeks to distance themselves, emotionally and psychologically from what they are feeling and what they're hearing from the person they're working with. These are difficult feelings. At the other end of the continuum is another very common reaction and that's a tendency to overidentify with the victim, to become over involved in trying to help them, to feel a special kind of a sense of responsibility to assist them in their process of recovering, whether it's the one end of the continuum of avoidance where the other end of the continuum of over involvement. Both have the potential to get in the way of being helpful. When one would hear a story, for example, about someone who have been tortured in the Bosnian War or horrific war story from a veteran stepped on a land mine and, and had his legs blown off or witness, ah, a buddy killed in a terrific(ph) way in combat and threatened with her life. 

00:08:25
JOHN P. WILSON These are powerful stories. And, and when they're that powerful, people react to them. That's a natural process. It's expectable and there's nothing abnormal about it, but it's important to recognize that they occur. At the same time, sometimes those doing the helping have some of their own memories and some of their own problems from the past stirred up by listening to other's difficulties. These are more personal reactions. These are more private and more individual and emanate from the history of the person in their own life. And when those get stirred up, they can also get in the way of being helpful. 

00:09:00
FRANK OCHBERG  Losing your sense of self, your sense of purpose, your sense of spirit and in a religious context, you can doubt that God loves you or cares. You can lose whatever relationship you have, ah, to your church, ah, to your temple, to other people who believe the way you do and, and for those of us who are nonbelievers in the traditional sense, it can still mean a loss, something at the center, something that you would consider your soul and spirit just isn't there. That's what Victor Frankl talked about is the ultimate search for those who survive the Holocaust, and that's what people who work with Holocaust survivors look for in themselves, holding on to, to purpose, to optimism, ah, to a sense of, of well-being and of worth, ah, at, at the, at the most, ah, universal level of meaning. 

00:10:00
Angie Panos, Ph.D., CEAP 

00:10:00
ANGIE PANOS Trauma really is like, uhm, the pebble dropping in the pond and the ripples coming out from affecting many people, so there's the patients that they've dealt with and then there's, there, there are facts, and then they come to me and, and talk to me about that, and sometimes I have effects from the trauma stories that I hear while I'm trying to support them. 

00:10:25
Symptoms of Compassion Fatigue Frank Ochber, M.D. 

00:10:25
FRANK OCHBERG  One of the first symptoms to look for is the lost of a sense of humor. If we're flexible, if we're enjoying ourselves, if we can relate to our colleagues in, in a way that has some zest, we're all right. It doesn't matter if we carry some sadness, some heartache, that's normal. But when you begin to lose that sense of humor, when you begin to wallow yourself off, and you begin to find that you have feelings that you don't like, angry feelings, resentful feelings, demoralized feelings that could well be the beginning. Ah, I consider that the area where compassion fatigue and burnout and work stress are, are almost all synonymous. But the particular element of compassion fatigue means we hurt too much because we're emphatic and it wears us down. It fatigues us, and we get tired. We've, we've lost our energy. How might it show, there are some subtle signs. Well in any these things, we might, we might drink too much. We might have aches and pains. Ah, we might have disrupted sleep. We might find that our sex lives aren't what they should be. Ah, we might have psychosomatic symptoms: headache, ah, bowel disturbances, breathing disturbances, skin rashes, ah, the, the whole range of psychosomatic problems. 

00:12:00
Atle Dyregrov, Ph.D. 

00:12:00
ATLE DYREGROV  What I experienced myself was that I changed my attitudes. When I was out with friends, I became more serious, and I was the joker. I was always the one who, who made the, the fun in the, in the group of friends, and, ah, I find myself sitting, talking with friends and, and found meaningless at state. They talked about details that I didn't think was important, so I started noticing these changes in myself, but I really didn't feel that I was very tired until I, ah, stopped working at the, ah, pediatric hospital because, then I went on to the university hospital, ah, the university, and ah, I felt so tired. I remember I was sitting a couple of weeks after I had started at the university and said, "I hope nobody calls from the hospital. I can't stand another family, another child's death." And I think for almost half a year, I, I dreaded that situation that I would get a call, ask to assist, ah, another family, so, so it was really hard for a while. 

00:13:05
ANGIE PANOS I was working in a burn trauma center and one thing that I wasn't psychologically prepared to deal with this how many of our patients were children? And how many of those children ended up in the burn center, because they have been purposely abused by their parents? And, uhm, at one particular time, we had a number of babies that we were taking care of. There is one particular little baby that was burned very badly, and he would really respond to my voice. I would sing to him and talk to him, and he would calm down. And so, I think it kind of bonded me to him in a way. One day I reported to work, and he wasn't there, and I found out that he passed away. And I had to go on with my duties as normal, as if nothing had happened, uhm, that was real hard for me. 

00:14:00
John P. Wilson, Ph.D. 

00:14:00
JOHN P. WILSON  It's not uncommon for the therapist to feel overwhelmed. I've had that experience. I've had it many times in, in my career as a therapist, and as a professional working in the field of traumatic stress. Early on, I had it quite a bit when I was working in the mid-70s with the returning Vietnam veterans. In, in, in my place of work in, in Cleveland, Ohio at that time, there were no programs for Vietnam veterans. There were no treatment programs. They had nowhere to go, and I had just conducted one of the first large-scale research studies on Vietnam veterans at that time and literally had interviewed thousands of men in the course of a short of period of time. And there were times when now, I took that home with me everyday, that I would hear their stories. I would have problem sleeping. There were times where I thought I was going crazy. I began to have dreams of their Vietnam combat experiences which were not mine. And I had other kinds of reactions where I had an intense anger feelings about their mistreatment, and I began to feel myself very much identified with them. And I felt burned out and at one point in time; I developed an ulcer, ah, at the end of this work. And, and I knew it was related to it. I didn't have any misgivings about that. But what I, what I did feel at that time was totally isolated, totally alone. I didn't know who to go to, because we didn't have, as we do today, organizations and places for people to go to deal with these issues. 

00:15:25
Vulnerabilities 

00:15:25
FRANK OCHBERG  There are several very different factors that make us vulnerable to compassion fatigue. One is the, the kind of incident, trauma, tragedy that we're dealing with if it is particularly bloody, brutal, overwhelming, if there are a lot of dead bodies involved, if there were children involved that can get to us and break through our defenses. Another has to deal with the kind of personality, age, ethnicity that we bring to the scene, and particularly, if, if we're younger, if we have some expectations that might be overly idealistic and if we're not that assured about our ability to help, we're vulnerable. 

00:16:20
CHARLES FIGLEY It's really the nature of, of trauma. It's, ah, it's frightening. It's, it's shocking, ah, and as a result, we're behaving like human beings, and then you add to that. It's your professional role to work with these people, and you add to that that it's your responsibility to make them whole, to enable them to be better off. And when you add to that, the responsibility you have in the organization, people look into you for, for direction. That's a tremendous amount of pressure that we put in on ourselves, so it's inevitable that we have some kind of reaction, ah, and frequently, it can be beyond our expectations and leave us helpless and, and frightened, scared sometimes. So, it's, it's an extraordinarily difficult position to be in, in which you balance acting like a human being but not reacting like a human being. 

00:17:10
JOHN P. WILSON The humanitarian worker gets immersed very quickly in this quagmire of human need. It's very easy for them to feel overwhelmed by the immensity of the task. How do you help so many people? For example, when I was in Bosnia, there were over 3 million refugees who were homeless in the country, and yet, there's just a handful of humanitarian workers from both international and non-governmental organizations going into the fields, providing care for women, children, displaced, and others victimized by the war. The task can seem truly overwhelming. Where do you start? One often begins to see that, that, that the responsibility is beyond one person, one agency, maybe even one whole government but yet it's there and that pressing demand, that pressing set of concerns of these people, refugees without food, refugees who have disease, women who've lost husband who have no means of support, situations of starvation, victims of torture, victims of oppression, victims of war. So, the worker, who comes out of Bosnia or Rwanda or some other place in the world, has been taken from a safe environment, thrust into a, a horrific environment of death, destruction, and chaos trying to do good work, and then quickly is removed back from that environment to their normal job whatever that might be. The absence of ability to debrief, to talk about those experiences, to manage the stress, intensifies what they just experienced. I'm very concerned and have for years been imploring international agencies as well as other organizations to carefully consider what are the mental health needs of those who do this kind of work. 

00:19:10
ATLE DYREGROV So most of my experience during the first four years well with families who lost children, they lost children in, ah, accidents and sudden infant death syndrome and, ah, other diseases that happens, so, uhm, and very soon after starting with this, I both felt myself that this was hard work and also the doctors asked me, "What, what happens to us? We, we feel so tired in this work." But working with, with children is, is having more effects on us than working with than working with adults, and, ah, I think there has several reasons for these. Ah, one is that, ah, the usual coping mechanisms that we, we use they are not so helpful with kids like they, they applied to adults but not with children, and it also upturns the, the order of the universe, children dying in the wrong end of life. 

00:20:05
Recognizing Compassion Fatigue in Oneself 

00:20:05
MARY BETH WILLIAMS  Many times in different fields, there is almost this, uhm, image that one cannot be affected, one cannot be impacted. And part of what I do is trying to teach them that yes, it happens to you, too. 

00:20:20
Angie Panos, Ph.D., CEAP 

00:20:20
ANGIE PANOS  I think trauma workers are likely to deny that they're vulnerable to compassion fatigue partly because of the way that they're trained. They are trained to develop an emotional style that allows them to be detached and cope with horrific events. For some people, I think there's kind of a notion to have opening a Pandora's Box that they admit that they're vulnerable. From so many things they've dealt with, once they open that up, they don't know where that would lead. And there's kind of a comfort in keeping kind of a, a crusty exterior and not having to feel those emotions or to face them. 

00:21:05
FRANK OCHBERG I was part of a team of 24 psychiatrists who are working as examiners for the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, and they showed us a film of a young man who claimed to be homosexually raped, have flashbacks, and what appeared to me to be posttraumatic symptoms afterwards. And some of the members of the team just couldn't believe him. He, he didn't seem credible to them, and I found myself feeling so defensive on his behalf. It looks true to me. Ah, I don't think I lost my temper, but I'm sure I got sanctimonious and overwrought, and I was pretty unpopular in expressing my point of view. I had to be counseled afterwards. Now, looking back on it, ah, I feel partly good about the fact that I had so much passion, but, but I'm awfully critical, because I, I didn't persuade anybody. I didn't do a good job of advocacy, and perhaps that happens with us too. We, we, ah, as part of compassion fatigue, we become so, ah, passionate rather than compassionate, and we could lose a little bit of judgment and good common sense. 

00:22:20
Charles Figley, Ph.D. 

00:22:20
CHARLES FIGLEY I had, ah, I would say looking back fairly substantial case of compassion fatigue and the way it affected me was that I became even more, ah, adamant in my antiwar stands. I became a very hostile. I was, ah, a real brute at times, and my students, ah, doctoral students several years later talked, ah, mentioned the times in which they could tell that I had come back from a, a stint at interviewing, because ah, I had very little patience. I wanted to get right to the facts. I had no tolerance whatsoever for emotions. I assumed that was associated with my work, but I was not sure. Ah, I thought perhaps that it was, ah, the, the, I was haunted by Vietnam in my own experiences, and it was, I was very confused, because I , I couldn't remember all that many, ah, emotional, ah, experiences in Vietnam that I didn't handle fairly well at the time. And we didn't have a major need to talk about that it was really the material that, that I had just experienced of, of someone else's experiences of, of taking on someone else's emotional reactions and the, and the life that they were leading at that moment. 

00:23:40
CHARLES FIGLEY I remember very well, uhm, the connection that I made between rape victims and combat veterans. And, ah, one of the interviews that I conducted in which this guy said he was about ready to kill himself that, that, that the gun was right on the table. His mother discovered. He, he would, it's very, very late at night. Somehow, she got up, and she saw the Jack Daniels that was three quarters finish, recognized that he could easily just jump and pull the gun quickly, so she was very calm about it but talked about her own experiences as a rape victim and how she had recognized and noticed the same sorts of symptoms at him but was not sure how to handle it with, not sure how to talk to him about it, because she didn't want to disclose it to him. So, I, ah, that was wonderful, and it was useful, and it was, ah, an intellectual breakthrough for me at least. Ah, but at the same time, it was something that I had to constantly go back to and to think about, and, and it was a guide for me in reviewing the literature. But at the same time, I had to then visualize his face and his eyes and, ah. 

00:24:50
CHARLES FIGLEY  Probably the most difficult part was that, uhm, it could have been me and that, ah. 

00:25:10
[sil.] 

00:25:10
CHARLES FIGLEY  And, uhm, ah, weren't not for, ah, a lot of things, uhm. 

00:25:30
[sil.] 

00:25:30
CHARLES FIGLEY  uhm, I could have been there, too. 

00:25:40
ANGIE PANOS I began to have nightmares. I began to, ah, feel, uhm, very detached from other people. I was grouchy a lot. I didn't notice that I had a problem though. I didn't tell anybody about it. I didn't talk about it. One day, I went to pick my daughter up from kindergarten, and she ran to me with her arms open, and she said, "Mommy, who died today?" And that struck me as how weird is this that my daughter is asking me that something is wrong here. And that was the point in time where I did say, "Wait a minute, my life is pretty out of balance." I haven't been emotionally available for my daughter, so she was trying to meet me on the only level that she could meet me in saying, "Mommy, you know, what are you going through?" 

00:26:30
Professionals can have both direct and secondary exposure to trauma Keith Onishi San Francisco Firefighter 

00:26:30
KEITH ONISHI  This fire started out on March 9th, 1995 and came in as a, as a residential alarm. We entered through the garage, ah, myself, Lou Mambretti and Melanie Stapper. It was her very first fire that she went to. Uhm, Louis Mambretti was three months away from retiring who is, ah, my officer. We opened that door leading for the garage into the house, and then the next, I don't know, next two or three minutes, it started to get really, really hot, ah, so Louis Mambretti said for us to back out and that's the last time I talked to him. Ah, as I was moving towards the middle of the garage, I decided to stick my hands up and try to see if there was like a, a door handle that maybe I'd lock the door. And as I was lying on my stomach and stuck my hand, about two feet into the air, uhm, and I was wearing gloves at that time. It, ah, roasted my hand. I got third-degree burns on my right hand. I decided to move towards, ah, the opposite end of the garage. Uhm, ah, there happen to be a car parked in there, uhm, which I, I used the tire to block the wind that was hitting my face. My whole body was pretty well-protected except for my face. It was pretty bad, but I never thought I was gonna die. Ah, that was probably one of the key points of coming back to work. Uhm, I'm sure if I thought that if I had thought I was gonna die, I don't think I'd be able to do the job again. 

00:28:05
KEITH ONISHI  Apparently, when we are back and that Lou Mambretti must have been looking right at the door. And when all the hot air came up, he never knew what hit him. Apparently, ah, I think he fell on to the ground, dislodged his mask, and, ah, tried to scramble to find his mask and as he was looking for his mask, he must have suck in a lot of the bad air and which aggravated his heart. Apparently, he, he died of, ah, I guess smoke inhalation and, and his heart worn out. Ah, Melanie Stapper, well, in the garage ran out of air. She said she pulled her mask off and that was the last thing she remembered. Uhm, Mel Stapper is now seeing-impaired. She could see the outline of your body, the colors you're wearing, but everything else is out of focus. So, out of the three people that went into that garage, only one which is myself was able to go back to work. 

00:29:10
Reducing Effects of Compassion Fatigue 

00:29:10
MARY BETH WILLIAMS  If a colleague ever said to me, "Ah, hey you need to take a break or you're stressed," and some have at times, I thank them for their caring. Because sometimes, I will lose perspective and getting involved in the moment, getting involved in the situation that wanting to do so much that you have to step back, and you have to. And if you don't have that ability, do it yourself knowing that there are colleagues who care enough to do that is so important. That's one of the things I found in this field is the number of colleagues who care. 

00:29:50
CHARLES FIGLEY What do I do about it? Now, I know about it. How can I take care of myself? How can I, ah, be invulnerable to this difficulty? Well, first thing, I, I would say is you can't. Ah, it's, if you are a sensitive human being, you are going to experience this, so the fact is then once you experienced it, what do you do? 

00:30:05
ANGIE PANOS A trauma worker needs to have a comprehensive plan to reduce the effects of compassion fatigue for themselves. It need to be a part of, ah, an ongoing system for them to keep a balance in their life anything that you do that's going to help you be resilient to stress will help you prevent the effects of compassion fatigue. So, all those things that we, as trauma workers, know that help keep us strong taking good care of our, our health and exercise, getting plenty of sleep and rest and relaxation, recreation and staying connected to others. 

00:30:45
CHARLES FIGLEY If you work with human beings that are suffering and that you in, in any way, ah, bear witness to their pain, someone else has to bear witness to the pain that you've absorbed. And whether that be a loved one or a colleague, ah, critical incidence stress debriefing and diffusing is very important and useful. 

00:31:00
ANGIE PANOS  I'm right now working with a, a hospital that is setting up ongoing support groups for their nurses in the trauma areas that constantly deal with death and horrifying traumatic things that they need on a daily basis to have a little debriefing. 

00:31:20
CHARLES FIGLEY  In our research, we found that there are two fundamental and major categories. The first one is a sense that you've done the best you could do under the circumstances. So, all of us need to sort of find our mantra if you will that, that ah, I've done the best I can do or that, uhm, today, today is today, tomorrow is another time, ah, that, ah, and then there's another aspect, the, the second set. We also can use a mantra when, and that is the notion of separating ourselves from those that are suffering. In other words, after we provide these services, the assistance and when, ah, we're on our own, and when we have either our own life or our personal life or someone else, we need to have the ability to let that person go and let those memories go and let that experiences go, so for separating ourselves. So, again, another mantra is they have their life; I have mine. Ah, I've done the best I could do for them. Ah, it's now their opportunity. Uhm, there maybe other opportunities to help them out in the future. 

00:32:30
MARY BETH WILLIAMS I weight lift. I go to the gym. It's been my salvation at least twice a week, I do body building, and I've been doing that for nine years now. And it's been a physical strength that has, has been able to build plus it's a great tension reliever. 

00:32:45
JOHN P. WILSON  When the work goes well, we're enriched by the work, because we help people to overcome a very profoundly difficult human experiences. And they recover, and they grow, and they become human beings and reached their sense again. That's a meaningful thing if one has an attitude of humility and respect for the victims and maintains that humility and respect for what they've gone through, then you will get back from them more than you'll ever give them. And that's a real gift that they give back to those who helped them. It's easy to lose perspective. It's good, it's important to have a sense of humor. It's important to have fun in your life. It's important to counterbalance the intensity of the work you do. 

00:33:35
ANGIE PANOS  I'm often asked to do fitness for doing evaluations to look at trauma workers and determine whether they're okay to continue on. Usually by that time, the worker comes to talk to me. They're willing to admit. Uhm, it is confidential. It is in a comfortable environment that they're willing to tell me what's really going on. Often times when a trauma worker is affected by compassion fatigue, it's affected every area of their life. Their work is impaired. Their personal life is impaired. Their health is impaired. It's very important that they get the kind of help and support they need. 

00:34:15
Keith Onishi San Francisco Firefighter 

00:34:15
KEITH ONISHI  One thing as a firefighter, you're always out to help other people and unfortunately, this time I became a victim. Our physician in the fire department asked me to go see a psychologist and which I did. I was off 11 months, and I, I've been, I came back for eight and then I just had another surgery. Ah, during that time spent of the eight months, I went to some pretty good fires. I just needed to know if I could still do the job. Because if I felt uncomfortable, I think I'll put other people at risk, so I really wanted to, ah, catch my first fire. After a while, you start to get numb out. Uhm, you see a lot, I mean, you see a lot of things on T.V. and it pretty much looks the same. Ah, we have a weird sense of humor which helps us get through a lot of it, too. Ah, people think its sick, but I guess if we hold it all in, it'll just get to you. One of the psychologists told me to is its good to just keep talking about it and because you don't wanna hold anything in or hide anything. And so, I was always pretty open about it. I decided to do this video, because I figure it would, ah, if anything I say helps anybody else, then it was worth it. 

00:35:35
KEITH ONISHI The death of, ah, Lou Mambretti and, and Melanie Stapper's now being visually impaired, that's a pretty big weight on my shoulders, and it still is. Uhm, the only thing to say is time has helped a lot. Uhm, like I said when I reviewed the, the videos and watching it over again, it tells me how far I've come, and I've come a pretty far, pretty far but the toll of the emotional thing is probably the most thing, uhm. The physical, I knew I was gonna get over it, and I knew I was able to, I was gonna move on. And I knew everything was gonna work, but I will just kinda have grafting done, and it's gonna be a little different, but everything works. I couldn't complain about my injuries because of what happened to the other two, uhm, and I was able to go back.

Atle Dyregrov, Ph.D. 

00:36:35
ATLE DYREGROV  When I was in Rwanda in 1984, I really was strongly affected, and I, I ah, did something I probably shouldn't have done. I went to see some of the massacres, ah, near, ah, a city called Nyamata. It was like I, I felt I, I couldn't really understand what they had been through without seeing some of this for myself, and the experience of, of seeing hundreds of, of dead bodies and, ah, small children with their, with their skulls cut in two was, was just, ah, incredible. And, ah, it's the first time in my professional life that I have started having nightmares and, and, ah, really felt, ah, badly shook by that and, but, ah, the good thing was that there was a colleague that I really could talk to and also the leader of UNICEF who was a good friend. We, we, we used a lot of time talking about this, and, and, ah, I really needed that as, as well as writing a lot about it. But, ah, I, Rwanda was something different. I've, after being in Iraq and being in Mozambique and Uganda and these countries had never affected me in the same way. But when you have hundred thousand of people who's been slaughtered the way that it happened and that, ah, took away some of the belief in, in, ah, the human race in a different way and then, ah walking near these churches, seeing all the bodies was more than I could take.

Frank Ochberg, M.D. 

00:38:10
FRANK OCHBERG  How do you help the person who refuses to get help? This is not easy. And a lot of us think we can put something down on a page, but I've, I've sat around afterwards with peers of mine, men in their '50s, '60s, and '70s, and asked, "How many times have you really counseled a friend?" And I think it's rare. Ah, and I think we're different ah, in, men might took it differently than women, ah, might do it in a mixed group in, in a different way. Of course you look for an opportunity for somebody, a, a friend, a fellow worker to raise the issue himself or herself, to say I'm not feeling right. And, and then a conversation can take place. And then something can be done to try to reduce the shame. Ah, we shouldn't feel ashamed. This happens. But, but something that normalizes it, says, yeah, I, I went through that too and here's what helped me, ah, but I think we have to be pretty frank with one another. It is not easy to help somebody who's in denial, or who's rather rigid, and who's loss the sense of humor and isn't looking for help, and in fact is blaming everybody but himself or herself. It's not easy at all.

Angie Panos, Ph.D., CEAP 

00:39:30
ANGIE PANOS Well, I think it's important to open up the subject with them. If you're the supervisor, talk to that troubled employee, talk to them about what they're going through, and gently suggest they get help, that's were you begin. You put their, your arm around them and then you say, "You know, take some time off here. Get some rest and talk to somebody about this. Get some help." But what if they don't take your suggestion? What if they say, "Hey, I'm tough, I'm fine. Uhm, I don't need any help, I'll be okay. It was just a bad day, I'll go on." Well, you need to watch that person and you need to put your arm around them again and confront them a little more.

John P. Wilson, Ph.D. 

00:40:15
JOHN P. WILSON Once that contact has been made, and the connection is, is met to soften that shell of, of distance and isolation that the person created around themselves. Then, uhm, corrective process starts to take place automatically, or you could call it a healing process, or you could call it simply having a time out for a while, to take a break, and do something else to get back on track, that's important. And if that doesn't happen, we lose people, we lose them in lots of different ways that we can lose them to depression, to suicide, to alcoholism, to drug addiction, to broken marriages, ah, or other forms of, of ah, decompensation and self-destructive behavior.

Clinician Self-Care 

00:41:05
ANGIE PANOS  It's really important for trauma workers to be able to set limits, and oftentimes we work for organizations that don't do those, the limit setting for us. They, we kind of wish they would, we kind of would hope they would, but that's not the case in most agencies, in most situations. Uhm, they will let you work as long as you will until exhaustion.

Carl C. Bell, M.D. 

00:41:40
CARL C. BELL You gotta be very mindful of the fact that you're a therapist, you're professional, you're being paid. Uhm, so you've got to be professional about how you go 'bout your work, you gotta separate your work from your home, you have to have real clear boundaries, very clear boundaries about what you're doing and the people you're dealing with, ah, you gotta, you gotta be prophylactic, you gotta practice what you preach, you gotta exercise and take care of your physical health, you gotta get good sleep at night, you gotta have good sex, you gotta do all these stuff. Ah, eat well, ah, do something that turns on your creative juices, uhm, and you gotta make time for that in your life, you gotta be real clear about that. And you gotta be clear that when you got worn down, and you're on your, you know, when, when your gas tank, the light comes on and the arrow's on E, you gotta tell people to get out of your face 'cause you need to go recharge your batteries. 

00:42:50
Charles Figley, Ph.D. 

00:42:50
CHARLES FIGLEY It has to be at the very highest level of that compassion stress and compassion fatigue are declared to be part of the tapestry of this work, part of the tapestry of this job and of the training. And that it's respected, and appreciated, and that the worker will be benefited by bringing it to their attention. And there are specific things that they can do in that regard. There are specific plans, for example, for a worker who may break down right on the job, a very specific plan just like in police forces in which there's a shooting, there's an absolute, there's an exact protocol that they follow, it's the same way here. There should be available self-test in which the worker can, at any time, take a, this test home and fill it out, and be able to score it themselves so it will be a recursive feedback to themselves so they all know how they're doing. They need to have a buddy system of, of workers watching over at least one other person and, and they're being watched over by another person. And it's their duty and their job to bring to their attention what's going on and, and some of the, the worries they see. They also will get to know that individual and be able to tell if they're beginning to, to act differently. 

00:44:05
ANGIE PANOS It can be difficult for management sometimes to know exactly what the employees of their organization need. And I think the reason for this is, you will have some of your employees that respond to traumatic events by using avoidance, by detaching, by not talking about it, they just want to go on like life is normal, and not talk about it, and forget about it. There are another group of employees that you will have that need to talk about it, that need it to be out in the open, and that's where they're at. And sometimes they will change from one group to, to the other, uhm, but when you have both of these groups of people in the same organization and you as the manager are trying to respond to their needs and plan interventions that will be helpful to the workers, it's very difficult. Well, I think it's important to realize that you do have to offer interventions, but that's just the beginning, you have to do it on going because eventually the group that wasn't ready to talk about it maybe at that time, will come around and they will need to talk about it. And if all their debriefings are over and done with, and there's no more support, they're really going to be hurting at that time. 

00:45:25
What's next? Where do we go from here? 

00:45:25
FRANK OCHBERG  Where are we going with this work, and will we ever make a profound difference? I, I hope so. Part of the reason that I'm devoting a lot of my life nowadays to working with journalists, is that I believe that if we can do a better job of telling the stories of those who suffer and survive, and help one another, we can do good in that job, but we can also perhaps prevent some of the vindictiveness, some of the frustrations, some of the anger that comes when we see evil and cruelty, and we're tempted to become evil and cruel ourselves. 

00:46:10
CHARLES FIGLEY  Maybe, ah, a final issue is really where do we go from here? What, ah, what's next, what's on the horizon? I mean, given the fact that, ah, that compassion fatigue as a concept really hasn't been around all that much time, what's the next vista? In, in my opinion, it's research and maybe it's because I'm a researcher, maybe my heart's there, but there's so much to discover, we, we know generally how people behave in different kind of context, different personalities, we need much more information about that. 

00:46:40
FRANK OCHBERG We have an opportunity to save lives, we have an opportunity to help those who have had close encounters with cruelty, with death, with loss, ah, to, to find themselves, to find each other, to be part of this worldwide network that we're forming as we speak. And I for one, I'm, I'm grateful for it, I'm, I'm grateful for everybody out there who's listening and learning and who's going to teach and treat, and spread the word. 

00:47:15
We hope that Trauma Workers worldwide will find comfort and support in the knowledge that while helping others may "hurt", we do have the ability to sustain ourselves and each other. We hope viewing this tape will lead to discussions of how individuals, work groups and managers can plan to manage the inevitable stress and create the resilience needed to meet the challenge of Trauma Work.
