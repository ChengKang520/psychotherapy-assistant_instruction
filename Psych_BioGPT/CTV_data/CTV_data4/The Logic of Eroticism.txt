RICH SIMON Welcome everyone. Welcome back to Who's Afraid of Couples Therapy. Rich Simon, editor of Psychotherapy Networker and your host. So, nothing, no discussion of who's afraid of couples therapy, would be complete without the subject of sexuality. Not something that all of us feel all that comfortable talking about, whether it's in the consulting room or in our personal lives. We're very fortunate to have with us, someone who's made a career out of being comfortable about talking about sex and dealing very honestly with topics that many folks might consider taboo. And so we're, it's my great privilege to introduce today's guest, Marty Klein. 

00:00:55
MARTY KLEIN Hi Rich. 

00:00:55
RICH SIMON Marty. So Marty, let's, uhm, let's get started here and, uh, how did you get interested professionally, uh, in this whole field of human sexuality? 

00:01:15
MARTY KLEIN Well after I finished, uh, college, I was interested in a career in, uh, in social change. I was in graduate school, in sociology and I became involved with Planned Parenthood, as a volunteer in the clinic. Uh, I was one of the people who was working with women who were coming in to get pregnancy tests and while the, they were waiting for the results of the test, we would talk with them and, uh, I began to notice a pattern. That women would come in, uh, to get a pregnancy test and then on the way out we'd fit them for a diaphragm or give them condoms or whatever it was and, uh, three months later they'd be back getting another pregnancy test and I would start to ask how come, how is it that you have the contraception thing, uh, figured out and yet you're back getting another pregnancy test. And what the women would say over and over again was some version of I didn't want my boyfriend to think that I was a slut, I didn't want some guy in a bar thinking that I was looking for sex, I didn't want to, uh, have to touch myself down there to put in a diaphragm. And so I began to understand that there's a step before contraceptive technology and that is people being comfortable with sexuality. And so my career goal of enhancing the use of family planning as a way of reducing poverty and domestic violence, I understood that in order to accomplish that, I had to get involved with sexuality and so I've spent the last 32 years helping people get more comfortable with their own sexuality, originally as a way of getting them more comfortable with, uh, with family planning, but now, uh, my goals are a little more comprehensive than that. 

00:03:00
RICH SIMON Okay, great. So you, you have talked a little bit about your particular take on sexuality and the various ways in which both, uhm, often therapists and clients collude to avoid the subject of sexuality or as you put it in a conversation we had not long ago, that there's these, these, uhm, mistaken assumptions that both clients and their therapists often have about sexuality that in your view is one of the chief obstacles to people with being able to improve their satisfaction with their sex lives. So let's talk a bit about, let's, give us some of these assumptions that therapists and clients share that you've encountered in your 32 year distinguished career in this field of sexuality, uh, that really seem like they get in the way of people improving their sex lives. 

00:03:50
MARTY KLEIN Well you know Rich, before I give you a couple of examples of those assumptions, let's take a step back for, for a second and really examine the issue of assumptions. What happens is that when, uh, when the patients’ assumptions about anything or what's driving their couples' problems or their individual problems, the therapist helps the patient notice those assumptions. For example, uhm, one assumption is that, uhm, that, that patients typically have is that, uhm, when I drink and I'm in a rage, uhm, everybody has to get out of my way because I'm right and everybody else is wrong and that assumption causes a lot of problems in couples. And so one thing that a therapist might do is they might want to, uh, talk to the patient about that assumption and most therapists can notice that assumption pretty easily. Well, when it comes to sexuality, a lot of the problems that our patients bring in are driven by their assumptions and we are going to talk about those assumptions in a second. A lot of the, a lot of the problems that patients have around sexuality, are driven by their assumptions, but most therapists share those same assumptions and so it's very, very difficult for the therapist to notice that the patient has that assumption. For example, uhm, a lot of patients will say well of course we never have sex when the woman is on her period or a lot of patients will say well of course, once I lose my erection, that means we can't have sex or a lot of patients have the assumption of, uh, well intercourse is real sex and everything else is foreplay or just messing around. Those are such common cultural assumptions, most therapists are marinating in those same cultural assumptions as the patients and so when patients refer to those assumptions either directly or more often indirectly, therapists don't even notice that. And so to the extent that those assumptions are driving the problems that people bring in, therapists don't notice that. 

00:05:50
RICH SIMON Yeah, okay and so as you, how do you go about then, as when couple comes in, how do you go about, before we get to the content of these assumptions, how do you begin to listen for and identify these assumptions and then we'll get to in a moment about how you begin to change them or challenge them or how do you, how do you deal with them in the therapy. So how do you, what's, what's this first, what's the first, is this the first step for you is when, uh, it's clear that there's a sexual issue, uh, within a couple? Is it sort of, are you listening for assumptions? How do you, how do you operate as a therapist? 

00:06:25
MARTY KLEIN Well with all therapy I'm always listening for assumptions and I'm always listening for the narrative, you know, I'm always listening, uhm, for the story because facts are not, uhm, self evident. I mean facts don't speak for themselves, every therapist this about some arena of therapy, facts don't speak for themselves. Uhm, I myself I have a PhD, but, uhm, I, uh, shall we say, dropped out of, uh, a PhD program before the one in which I got my degree. Now, is that because I was lazy? Is that because I was smart enough to realize I was in the wrong program? Is that because I wasn't emotionally mature enough? We don't know and, uh, my story about that part of my life has changed over the last 35 years and that's true with, with all stories, that's true with all narratives. So one thing the therapist needs to do is they need to pay attention to the way that people that, that patients string together the facts, uh, but the thing that I, that, the way that I approach couples around the sexual stuff is from a position of sort of radical ignorance, uh, a position of I really don't know what you mean, you're going to have to explain it to me. You're going to have to explain it to me and I don't assume that when my two o' clock couple says we don't have very much sex and my six o' clock couple says we don't have very much sex, I don't assume that those two couples mean the same thing. And when people talk about, uhm, here's a real common example. People will come in and they'll describe a situation in which they want to have sex, they go to have sex, they take off their clothes and then the guy loses his erection or the woman doesn't lubricate, let's say it's a heterosexual couple and, uhm, or somebody leans on somebody's hair and it hurts or, uhm, or, or somebody goes to open a condom package and the condom goes flying across the room. A lot of couples describe a situation in which they go to have sex and there's one event, there's one thing that happens and they then say and then of course we couldn't have sex. And from a position of ignorance, my question is, why. Why, why couldn't you have sex after such and such happened and it doesn't matter what such and such is, why couldn't you continue having sex? Now if the therapist shares the assumption of the patient that well, of course once you call somebody the wrong name you can't have sex after that, well of course if there's no erection in the bedroom you can't have sex, well of course if somebody just, uh, you know, got their hair pulled and they’re angry about it, of course you can't have sex. If the therapist shares that assumption with the, with the patients, the therapist isn't going to be able to uncover. The therapist isn't going to be able to direct the patients' attention to what do you guys do after that happens. So I don't ask patients and then what happened, I ask patients and then what did you do. I don't ask patients and then what happened, I say and then what did you say. So, by approaching patients or couples from this position of ignorance, radical ignorance, uhm, you force patients to actually talk about what they're thinking and what they do, what decisions do they make. You know, any 20 minutes that a couple is together, they're making hundreds of decisions, second by second by second by second and polite people don't talk about that and, uh, normal people, we don't talk about that. You know even you and I, during our conversation, we're constantly making decisions. Should I change my body, should I change the tone of my voice, should I reach for a cup of coffee. Whenever two people are together they're always making decisions together. So what decisions are people making when they're being sexual together or when they're deciding not to be sexual together. That's the stuff that I focus my patients attention on and it's very valuable, it could also drive them crazy because I, I, you know I force them to break things down really, really small. For example, uhm, uh, a couple will, will be having sex and, uh, she'll notice that, uh, she just started her period, okay, so some couples at that point they say we have to stop. Then my question is why did you stop, instead of oh yeah of course. I don't say of course a lot, uhm, or, uhm, or so, uh, a couple will be having sex and she noticed, she noticed or he noticed that she just started her period and then somebody will say oh I guess we have to stop. Why? Well because it's messy. Uh huh, so what would you normally do if you were in the middle of something and there was a mess. Like, you know, you're having breakfast and someone spills their coffee, do you say we can't have breakfast anymore? No. What do you do? You get a towel, okay. So I wonder why if you know how to deal with a mess in the kitchen, how is it that you deal with a mess in the bedroom differently? 

00:11:40
RICH SIMON Yeah, okay. So what's the most common sexual presenting issue that you deal with in your practice? 

00:11:50
MARTY KLEIN Uh, the most common issue is differences in desire or a drop in desire, conflict about desire. We're getting more and more cases now of course about pornography but, uhm, but I think still the most and, and for non-specialist, for, and you know only half of my case list is about sexuality, the other half is about everything else, I think for non-specialist the most common, uh, sexual presenting problem would be around desire. 

00:12:20
RICH SIMON Okay, so take us through, well let's just, tell me about a first interview, a couple you described that is sort of a classic couple, given that all couples are, are, have all of their idiosyncrasies, give us the, if you could give us the flavor of what's something you hear a lot in, in a, in an interview, in a first interview and then if you can get people, flavor, how do you explore their, how do you take something and make it, uhm, something that can be acted upon that can help people change it. 

00:12:50
MARTY KLEIN Well, let's see. If it's a, if it's a classic, if it's a paradigmatic couple with a desire issue, I'll be the third or fourth therapist that they've seen, just for starters. Just for starters and whenever I'm not the first therapist that a couple has seen, I keep in mind that this is a couple that feels like a failure already and the therapy hasn't even started yet and they already feel like a failure. 

00:13:15
RICH SIMON Oh, interesting. Okay. 

00:13:15
MARTY KLEIN So, we want to be compassionate about that, we want to be sympathetic about that and I want to find out what happened with doctor Jones. What was it like to be in therapy with doctor Jones? Was doctor Jones chronically late to session? You know, was doctor Jones handing out more chicken soup than therapy. Was doctor Jones, uhm, just so warm and sweet and cuddly and in contrast I'm not going to be that way. So I want to find out a little bit about the other therapy. So couples come in and you know, before I even ask them, uh, before I even inquire about the presenting problem, I want to know a little bit about them. People come in and they always want to tell me the problem right away. I say, you know, let's do it in a different order. You know, how old are you, do you have a job, what do you do, how long you've been living together, what do you do for fun? Before I want to know about the problem, I want to know what do you guys do for fun and I get a lot of couples who say, uh, nothing. That's interesting. Anyway, the intake will unfold and eventually I'll say so, uh, what is it you want to accomplish here? 

00:14:20
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

00:14:25
MARTY KLEIN It's not what is your problem, it's what do you want to accomplish here. What is our project going to be? 

00:14:30
RICH SIMON Uh-huh, yeah. 

00:14:35
MARTY KLEIN And even that for a lot of couples is a big step, because couples will immediately launch into well here's the problem and I will interrupt them, just put up my hand and say wait, wait, wait, I didn't ask you what the problem is, would you, would you please tell me what you want to accomplish here? The, the way that most couples frame their problem, is part of the problem. So I don't want to know what your problem is, we'll get to that more than once, I want to know what you want to accomplish. And a lot of times they'll look at each other and say, uh, we want to be happier. Okay, and what does that mean? Here's that ignorance again, and what do you mean by that, what do you mean by we want to be happy again? Well we want to get along better. Uh-huh, and if you were getting along better what would that look like? And this is where therapy can be a little boring, you know, and, but to keep asking people what do you mean, what do you mean, what do you mean and eventually people will start talking about we want less of this, less of this, less of this. Okay, what do you want more of? And again, a lot of couples they haven't thought much about that. So eventually, eventually with these desire issues, which is what you asked about, people will say things like we want to have, we want to have more sex or I want her to want more sex or I want him to want more sex or I want him to want less sex, you know, people begin to talk about this desire contrast. At that point I always hope that there's something dreadfully wrong with the relationship because that's something we know how to deal with right? 

00:16:05
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:16:05
MARTY KLEIN A lot easier than fixing the desire. So I want to know about, uhm, what do, how, how are the couples managing this difference in desire, because every couple has differences in their desire for lots of things. Whether it's going out for Chinese food, whether it's going out to the movies, whether it's sitting on the floor playing with the kids, whether it's cleaning up the garage, every couple has differences in desire about a whole range of things. And if you ask, so, so I might ask, you know, uh, how do you decide where to go out for dinner on Saturday night. You know, what if you wants Chinese and one of you wants Italian? And it's very interesting because some couples will say oh, don't get me started on Saturday night dinner, he is so finicky about where we go, it has to be exactly this way. Well, you know, that's real interesting. Or some couples will say oh where do we go on Saturday night? Well you know, he makes most of the money so he gets to decide. So by asking people how they deal with these ordinary mundane, uh, uh, contrasting desires for things, you begin to uncover the power structure in the relationship. 

00:17:15
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:17:20
MARTY KLEIN Every, every relationship has a power structure, even yours and mine, right? Every relationship has to grapple with the distribution of power and the use of power. What, what's a legitimate use of power, etcetera. So, we start talking about that in non-sexual arenas where people are more comfortable, where people have more of a vocabulary, because of the problems with talking about sex with couples is that they don't have enough vocabulary. Most couples have enough vocabulary with some things, sex is typically not one of them, especially if the sex doesn't work very well. So we talk about how power is distributed and how people use power, uhm, in non-sexual ways and so eventually I get around to asking about, well, do you enjoy sex with each other. That can be a very painful discussion. 

00:18:05
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:18:10
MARTY KLEIN And in an attempt to, to make it a little easier for people, rather than put people on the spot, rather than say to Joe, Joe do you enjoy sex with Mary, Mary do you enjoy sex with Joe, I try and make it a little easier. I say Joe, as far as you know, does Mary enjoy sex with you? Mary as far as you know, does Joe enjoy sex with you? 

00:18:30
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:18:35
MARTY KLEIN And begin to talk about what is the quality of the experience. And I actually ask them, if there's a desire discrepancy or if they don't have very much sex. I'll ask each of them, what keeps you from initiating sex and people frequently talk about the couple, well, you know, we are under a lot of stress or we don't have a lot of time or we're not in the, in the habit. All of which is true, but it, it allows people to evade responsibility for their decisions about this. So I'll have to ask again, Mary what keeps you from initiating sex? And then we find out things like, the sex hurts or it's boring or it's too orgasm focused or people are embarrassed about their bodies or, uhm, uh, people are still negotiating about what's going to be included in the sexual experience and what's not going to be included in the sexual experience. Which is an amazing thing, I mean, after ten years I mean, you're married Rich. Uhm, don't you, don't you assume that if you and your wife go to a restaurant, you could taste something and you could turn to your wife and say this will be too spicy for you or this is exactly the way you like it. You can do that right? 

00:19:50
RICH SIMON Okay, yeah. 

00:19:55
MARTY KLEIN And she can do that for you. Or, uhm, sure. 

00:19:55
RICH SIMON I'd like to think so. 

00:20:00
MARTY KLEIN But when, so, so every couple that's been together for a while, a healthy couple, they have learned about each other's tastes whether it's in food, in temperature you know? I can walk into a room and I can say to myself, my wife is going to think it's too cold in here. It's fine with me, but I know that, this is that zone where I'm comfortable and she's too chilly. So every healthy couple, they learn after a while, they learn about each other's tastes and each other's subjective experiences and they come to agreements about, okay when we're together, we won't go to certain kinds of movies because I know that you never like those movies. We won't go to certain kinds of, uh, concerts because I know you hate that kind of music. We won't go Indian restaurants because I've learned that no matter which Indian restaurant we go to, you don't like Indian food. 

00:20:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:20:55
MARTY KLEIN But when it comes to sex, a lot of couples, they haven't settled that issue and so ten years into it, one of them is still trying to put their finger into the other one's butt and the other is still trying to protect their butt from having a finger put in it. And after ten years they still haven't settled it. And my question, when, when that comes up, which is one of the reasons that people don't have sex, when, when I finally uncover that reality in a couple, I will turn to each of them, not just the person with the finger, the other person too, I'll ask each of them in turn, how is it that you haven't settled this. How is it that after ten years, of him saying no I don't want a finger in my butt, you still try and put your finger in his butt. And how is it after ten years of not wanting a finger in your butt, you somehow have not been able to sit your partner down and say sweetheart I'll love you until the end of time, but I absolutely guarantee for the next 5,000 years, I am not going to want your finger in my butt during sex. How is it that you two haven't settled this? Now personally, I don't care if you put your finger in each other's butts or not, that's none of my business, you know. I don't care. What I care about is the fact that you two haven't settled the issue. 

00:22:15
RICH SIMON And then what, what is it that people tend to tell you in response to that question, that very interesting question? 

00:22:20
MARTY KLEIN Well that's, that's all over the map. I mean, uhm, you know, some people will start crying and say you're absolutely right, I feel completely powerless to shape the sexual experience and so what I've done is I've retreated. And the other person might not realize just how expensive this finger in the butt thing over and over and over and over and over again, this person just may not realize how expensive it's been for the other person. Because this person figures, you know, so I try it, they say no, I say okay no problem and then the next week I try it, they say no, I say okay no problem. Sometimes this person just doesn't realize what that's like for this person. Sometimes this person doesn't realize that this person, they think gee maybe we'll have sex tonight, uh, you know what? I don't want to hassle with that finger in the butt thing, the hell with it, it's just not worth it. This person doesn't even realize it. Couples are all over the map on how they respond to things like that. 

00:23:15
RICH SIMON Okay. So as, as I'm listening to you, and, and you're such an engaging fellow and you're, and your radical ignorance and this tone of you can say anything you want with me. Is it, is, is, when you extend this kind of invitation through your manner, the way you phrase the question, does, do most couples find it easy even if they haven't, if previously this has been a taboo topic for them to begin to step up to plate and answer your questions 

00:23:45
MARTY KLEIN Well, strictly just to answer your question strictly, most couples find it just fine, some couples find it really problematic. Uhm, and I think every therapist after ten or twenty years, they learn how, how to smell their patients and they learn, you know, this is somebody that you can say this and this is somebody, you know, you shouldn't do that. Uhm, but, we, we therapists, we expect our patients to be able to communicate with each other in a certain way. We need to be able to model that at least as well as we want them to be able to do it. 

00:24:20
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:24:25
MARTY KLEIN You know, I don't care if you call it, uhm, a vagina or, uh, a deep wet hole or a scented rose garden, I don't care what you call it, but you've got to call it something. You've got to call it something and if we expect patients to be able to say to each other, listen sweetheart, a quarter an inch to the left would be really much better, or if we expect patients to say to each other honey, honey, honey you're using too much teeth on that thing, you know, relax a little bit. If we expect patients to be able to say that to each other, we need to be able to talk exactly the same way and, and patients can interact with us, where the stakes are much lower than when they interact with each other. Patients can interact with us, and begin to, uhm, begin to grapple with hearing these magic syllables, begin to grapple with hearing these words, begin to grapple with the images that these words present. They can do it in the consulting room I think, as a precursor to becoming comfortable doing it with each other. 

00:25:30
RICH SIMON So that's as you, just as you’re saying that, that seems like a big part of, what I'm sure is that immediate impact that you have on couples. This is a territory that you're quite comfortable with and, and you have the vocabulary and you have an ease of moving out and different forms of diction, shall we say with the sex acts. 

00:25:50
MARTY KLEIN Right. I mean, how many patients do think say oh my god, I'm ejaculating, oh my god I'm ejaculating? I mean, nobody says that. Nobody says that, right? So it's, so I mean, I can use the word ejaculate, I can say come, I can say a lot of different things, you have to calibrate it on the other hand. 

00:26:10
RICH SIMON You have to calibrate with your, and challenging on what's too much. 

00:26:15
MARTY KLEIN Yeah, on the one hand you don't want to just blast people out of the water, on the other hand, you can't tip toe around these things because you give patients the message that there's something different about sex. I think sex is just like everything else, except different. 

00:26:30
RICH SIMON Uh huh, okay. So, well let's, let's go back to where we started here. So that there, where you're coming in, we're talking about sexual desire, people have different, different desires, different levels of desires with each other. They’ve come in often, you’re saying this is a difficult issue, they’ve been in previous therapy they’ve experienced failure in trying to have to deal with this. Take us through a little bit more of how you set the, the pace of the therapy in motion then. So you described a little bit of this, the beginning of the conversation about this, so just that people get, can kind of get a sense of how, what would be the next, uh, step for you in terms of beginning to help people work on these desire discrepancies if that's the issue. 

00:27:15
MARTY KLEIN Well, this isn't so helpful but the answer is it depends. Uhm, I mean, we could spend the entire first session and hardly talk about sex at all, you know, because if he's still angry, that she didn't go to his brother's wedding six years ago, there's no point in talking about sex. I mean, if that's the real thing that's going on, we don't need to talk about sex. If she's still angry that he's working with a start up and he works 80 hours a week and he's never ever, ever home, and then he shows up Saturday from work at four o' clock, wants to take a shower and get into bed with her, we don't need to talk about sex. So, partly, in the initial session or two, I'm sort of feeling out the, the relationship to see are there any of these big obstacles and, and frequently there are, I'd say at least half the time, it, it has nothing to do with sex. And, you know, partly you want to have your cross-cultural, uh, sensitivity, you know, if this is a couple from China or India and it's first born son and there's all that stuff going on and, uhm, partly you want to pay attention to how do people feel about their bodies. If the woman is feeling, uhm, uh, ever since I had my kids, you know, now I'm not attractive anymore and so I don't want to have sex with the lights on. So, partly it's a matter of discerning, is this a sexual issue or, or is there is it not a sexual issue. Uhm, that's one of the reasons that I don't, that I don't ask patients what's the problem, because frequently the way they frame this as a sex problem, is, is getting in the way of solving the problem. It's not a sex problem if he's still angry that she didn't go to his brother's wedding and as a result he never wants to have sex. That's not a sex problem. Or with erections, you know, uhm, people come in and they, uh, you know, I don't get erections or I get them and I lose them, or, uh, I don't have orgasms when I want to or whatever it is and here's more of that ignorance, you know, I ask people. Okay, so you don't have orgasms when you have sex together, why is that a problem? Oh so you lose your erections during sex, and what exactly is the problem with that? Patients look at me they say, uh, you are the sex guy, right? Uh huh, so what is the problem that you lose your erection during sex? And, the answers range all over the map. People will say things like, it means I'm not a real man. That's not a sex problem. I'm afraid my wife's going to leave me. That's not a sex problem. It means I can't satisfy my wife. That's not a sex problem. I mean a lot of the answers that people give to these things, uhm. 

00:30:15
RICH SIMON That isn't a sex problem, so take us down that path a little bit. I, I think I can follow you up to that point. What, now what way, let me portray some radical ignorance of my own, why is that not a sex problem, if you can't satisfy your partner? 

00:30:30
MARTY KLEIN Because if you ask, if you ask, if you, if you, if you look at most couples issues, they haven't had all the conversations that they need to have. They haven't shared as much information as they need to share, they haven't asked all the questions they need to ask. When he says I can't satisfy my wife because I lose my erections in the middle of sex, most of the time he hasn't asked her gee honey, what are the things you enjoy most about sex, gee honey, the fact that I lose my erections during sex, how does that actually effect you? They haven't discussed that. You know most women, the way they have an orgasm it's not from, uh, penis vagina intercourse anyway. Not that orgasm is the goal of sex, but, uhm, most couples once they decide that they have a sexual issue, the communication collapses because everybody except me seems to know that well talking about sex is really difficult. I tell patients talking about sex is not difficult, you have difficulty talking about sex. I got that. 

00:31:40
RICH SIMON Uh huh. Okay. 

00:31:45
MARTY KLEIN And we can change that. If the difficulty lives in the sex, we can't change that. You know, sex is eternal, right, we can't change that. But if the difficulty is that you have problems, you're embarrassed talking about sex, that we could change. 

00:31:55
RICH SIMON Yeah, okay. So, in this, so when is it a, so it's a discussion issue, it's a sharing of experience issue, it's a couples, when is it a sex issue. Are there any sex issues that are sex issues? 

00:32:15
MARTY KLEIN I don't think so, not really. Uhm, and that's good news, you know, I mean. 

00:32:15
RICH SIMON Okay, all right. That's okay, okay that's good news, yeah. 

00:32:20
MARTY KLEIN You know most couples, they do have some tools, they do have some tools. They, uhm, they know how to, uh, share a cookie, they know how to raise their kids somewhat, they know how to spend their money somewhat. I want couples at the very, very least, I want couples to be able to use the tools that they have to be able to manage their sexual relationship. Communication skills, uhm, uh, ability to empathize, uhm, ability to be patient, ability to self-soothe. I mean, how is it that you can have a couple where he says, tonight let's have Italian food and she says no, no, let's have Chinese food, next week we can have Italian food. He says okay, then you get into bed and he says how about a blow job and she says no not tonight, how about next week and he can't handle that. Now how is it that people don't see that those two things are the exact same situation? 

00:33:15
RICH SIMON Because they're not in therapy with you Marty. That, that's the reason. Okay, so that's interesting. 

00:33:20
MARTY KLEIN So my question, my question is, if you know how to manage that, how is it that you don't use that skill to manage this? And that's not, uhm, that's not a rhetorical question, that's a real question. I actually do want to know and I want and most people say I don't know, say well, think about it. And that's when I sit back, you know and I think about what I'm going to have for dinner, okay. So, uhm, I really want people to think about it. How is it that you don't use the skill that you successfully use over there, when it comes to sex? 

00:33:55
RICH SIMON Okay, okay. So, uhm, so, I'm beginning to get the, the flavor of, so you're creating this zone in which conversation becomes possible on all kinds of things and this mystical experience of sex and the do's and the don’ts and our fantasies and whatever it is that's going on. You're creating a space for people in which it becomes very, everyday, in which you can share, you can say anything. 

00:34:25
MARTY KLEIN That's right. 

00:34:25
RICH SIMON And so, as, as you, so it, it, it sounds like, it's not like there's some specialized technique here, given whatever the sexual issue is, this isn't master's and Johnson and a, you know, you have a bunch of methods for different kinds of sexual problems, it's sort of like okay, here, here you go. So what's the problem? Let's, let's talk about it. Here's this something that you have a competency in, how is that different than this area where you feel so incompetent and mystified. 

00:34:55
MARTY KLEIN You're exposing me as having no expertise whatsoever, Rich. 

00:35:00
RICH SIMON You're very good at doing stuff, being masterful at, at, uh, at treading into this terrain that many of us are very anxious about. So that's nothing to be, uh, to, to be dismissed in the least, so that's, that's very interesting. So, all right so, and, and answer that though. I mean, I don't mean to in any way to minimize that, that sounds like a very, such a useful thing for, for any couple. 

00:35:25
MARTY KLEIN It is. 

00:35:25
RICH SIMON So is there, and, is there another dimension to it that you want to make sure we, we get at the same time. Not that that isn't sufficient, but is there another aspect of the work that you really want to make sure that people get as they're trying to, uhm, improve their skills in this area and their comfort level and, and being able to be more helpful to couples. 

00:35:45
MARTY KLEIN Well, I just keep asking a lot of questions, and well here's something that I can say. Uhm, therapists ask me, well I don't know anything about S and M, how do deal with patients into S and M or I don't know anything about bisexuality, how do I deal with patients who are into bisexuality, etcetera. 

00:36:15
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:36:20
MARTY KLEIN And, I don't think patients need, I, I don't think therapists need to understand anything about S and M per say, what they need to understand is what is S and M mean to this particular couple. And it's handy to know a little bit about it and I do workshops where I tell people or I tell therapists a little bit about this and this and this and this. But the main thing, it's like, it's like saying to somebody, uhm, well I can't understand you, you're Jewish and I don't know anything about Judaism. And the real thing, if you want to understand a person who's Jewish, is not to understand Judaism, it's to understand what is your Jewishness or what does your Judaism mean to you? Is it about history, is it about culture, is it about food, is it about god, is it about women, you know, what is it about? So you, you could know a lot about a subject, but you still have to ask the couple what does it mean to you, I mean, most of my patients just like most of most therapists patients, are heterosexual. I don't assume that I know what heterosexuality means to this couple, they have to tell me. So, so I would encourage therapists, when they, when patients reveal that they're into something that the therapist isn't familiar with, don't flip out about oh my god I don't know anything about that. Nobody, nobody knows what something means to a patient, until engage the patient and you ask about it. Even, even the most ordinary thing. I have two kids, what does that mean to you? Is that a source of celebration or is that a source of woe? I don't know, I've got to ask. 

00:38:05
RICH SIMON Yep, yep. 

00:38:05
MARTY KLEIN Are the children healthy, do the children get along with each other? Were the children planned, etcetera. So when the therapist trips over this couple is into S and M or he likes to spank her or he likes to be spanked or you know, whatever it is, just ask a lot of questions and don't be afraid to sound ignorant. Just ask, what is that like, why do you do it. And so here's a real simple example, oh I like to be spanked. Uh huh, and she doesn't like to do that. Okay, uhm, do you like to be spanked every time you have sex? Now you don't need to know anything about spanking to ask that question. Do you want to be spanked every time you have sex, or just once in a while? 

00:38:50
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm, yep. 

00:38:55
MARTY KLEIN I think that's a great question and if, and if he says I want to be spanked every time I have sex, that's a different situation than if he says you know, once in a while would be nice. Once in a while would be nice. Now you turn to her, she's afraid that if she does it once, he's going to want her to do it at every single time and she doesn't want to spank him every single time. Well the good news is that he doesn't want to be spanked every single time, but he asks about it a lot because she never does it and they still haven’t worked out is spanking going to be part of our sex or not. 

00:39:30
RICH SIMON Yeah, yep. So it's very liberating, you sound like, you know, I don't think my father would have gone into being a sex therapist, but his advice to me and maybe that's why I'm doing what I do for a living, he says Richard if you don't know, ask. So and that's, it's, you're offering some fatherly to the therapists out there. Uhm, so looking, so you've been doing this for a long time and so you've had your own learning curve and let's take a step back from this for a moment. So what have been the important lessons for you, so most people listening just I can't imagine have your comfort level in talking about the whole range of, of practices and issues and fantasies and involved in human sexuality. What's your learning curve? What have been the big lessons for you as, over these 32 years? If you had two or three things that really have been important for you that you think have really enhanced your, if you could just pull those out. What, what occurs to you? 

00:40:35
MARTY KLEIN I think the main thing that I've learned is that if you really, really focus on process, it's really possible to be content neutral. It's really possible to be non-judgmental if you really focus on process. Uhm, we all have patients to do stuff, that we scratch our heads and say, what? We all have patients we think to ourselves, you actually like doing that? I don't get it. Uhm, and, and we all have couples where what one person wants seems so reasonable and what the other person wants seems so weird, or unreasonable, or what one person wants seems so reasonable and the other person just can't see the reasonableness of it. We all have couples like that. If you, if you, if you look at the process, if you look at the people's subjective experiences enough, it's possible to not take sides. It's possible to embrace both of those people equally. It can be difficult, you know, some poor woman who says I don't climax from intercourse, I know how, I know how to have orgasms real easily honey, just use your hand or use your mouth but let me use a vibrator and absolutely insists, you've got to come from intercourse and if I have to get on top of you and drill you for 45 minutes or an hour and a half, for seven hours or whatever it is, I'm going to do it until you climax, I don't care how sore you get. You know, that's a challenging couple because what she's saying is so reasonable, and what he's saying is so unreasonable and it's easy to take sides, but if you tune in to, if you tune in to deeply enough, if you tune in to his anxiety about not being adequate, for example. His anxiety that he's not as good as his father or his brothers or all the other men in the whole world, or her ex-husband, then it's possible to embrace him as much as we embrace her. And, and that’s, that’s just so important for the therapist to be able to do and you know, in my personal life, I'm a judgmental kind of person. Uhm, in the, in the office, in the office my job is to find a place to stand to where I can genuinely embrace both people. And what I've learned is that that's my job to do that and to do that and to find that place to stand. 

00:43:25
RICH SIMON Okay. So, so these days having learned that lesson and I'm sure others over time and people, uhm, are coming to you and you've written on the subject and you're acknowledged to be one of the experts in this area of human sexuality. What's, what's the, what's challenging for you these days? Where are the couples with whom you don't feel like you're as helpful as you would like to be? What pushes you up against your limits? 

00:43:55
MARTY KLEIN Well two things come to mind. Uhm, the first thing is about birth control. It, uhm, it still drives me crazy when couples come in and they're either taking contraceptive risks or they're using withdrawal as a method of birth control or, uhm, or they come in and they have an unattended pregnancy. It, that still just drives me crazy. And, uh, and I, I'm sympathetic about people's issues about it, whether it's about, uh, I didn't want to put on a condom because I'm afraid I'll lose my erection while I put on a condom or, uhm, we don't have sex that often and so I don't want to be on the pill because it makes me fat or, uhm, or here's another one. Uhm, we don't use birth control because we haven't decided whether or not we're going to have another child. I have couples like that all the time. They're still figuring out, are we going to have, are we going to have another one or are we going to stop with two or whatever it is. So there's lots of reasons that people have conflict about contraception but it, but that's an issue in which I wish I could be even more effective than I am. I know that I ask about contraception more than practically any therapist on this earth, uhm, including by the way with gay men and lesbians because, just like heterosexual people have same gender sex, gay men and lesbians occasionally do have other gender, hetero sex. So we've got to ask everybody. Uh, so that, that's one arena in which I wish I could be more helpful. The, the other arena is about pornography. Pornography right now is such a hot issue and there's so much, uhm, so much anger about it and most therapists are really making things worse. How's that for a controversial statement? Most therapists are making things worse. 

00:45:45
RICH SIMON So tell us about that, which, which, what do you mean by that? 

00:45:50
MARTY KLEIN Well, couple comes in, and what's the presenting problem? He said she is obsessed with knitting. She's always knitting, she's getting all these magazines in the mail, knitting magazines. Every Tuesday night she goes to her knitting club, every time I sit down on the couch there's a knitting needle poking me in the butt and I open the closet to get my coat and all these skeins of wool they fall on top of my head and doc I want you to tell her that she's obsessed with knitting and she's got to stop doing it. In fact, I want to forbid her from having anything to do with knitting in this house. Most therapists would not agree with this guy and say you're right, we've got to forbid you from being involved with knitting. Most therapists would not say that. But when it comes to pornography, a lot of couples come in, she complains he's obsessed with pornography, and she wants to forbid that crap from being in the house and a lot of therapists will say, you're right, we've got to forbid pornography in the house. We've got to stop you from using pornography and without knowing anything about pornography, you know an observer would wonder why therapists have different rules for different content. Very unusual for a therapist to say the rules change just because the content changes. 

00:47:20
RICH SIMON Hmm. 

00:47:25
MARTY KLEIN So, what I've come to realize is that most of the conflict about pornography is about something else. A lot of the conflict about pornography is about the couple's sexuality having collapsed over time and the couple not wanting to talk about that. It's very, very common configuration. Couples get together, they have perfectly good sex, they have two children, they, uh, spend twelve years together, gradually the sex declines in both frequency and quality, the guy masturbates to pornography, she doesn't, or she does it very little. She feels abandoned, she feels his sexual attention is going elsewhere and then she complains about the pornography, he's defensive about it she doesn't want him to do it, he hides it, she discovers it, she's angry that he's hiding it from her, he's defensive again. And all of this baroque, uh, decoration allows the couple to avoid talking about, gee whiz, we use to have a good sexual relationship and now we don't, isn't that awful. 

00:48:45
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:48:50
MARTY KLEIN So, under those circumstances, I don't want to make pornography the, the bad guy, you know. I want to talk to the couple about the extraordinarily painful subject. For all three of us, not just for them, the extraordinarily painful discussion of how is that sex between the two of you has collapsed and what are we going to do about it? Nobody, nobody leaves a good sexual relationship in favor of movies or stories about somebody else. What people do is, what people, but, but, but, that's the most common therapeutic model. I mean, if you have a couple who comes in like I just described, and the therapist says well we have to get the guy to stop using pornography, that's, that's based on the assumption that pornography has this sort of magnetic pull that has pulled the guy away from the couple. That's just silly. Who in their right mind would, would say gee, a really healthy, exciting, nourishing sexual relationship with a real-life person who I really like? Or, masturbating to pictures alone hoping that nobody's going to catch me. Hmm, tough choice. Mm, I think I'll do this. I mean nobody would do that. Nobody would do that. So, I'm very, very, very sympathetic about women who feel abandoned sexually, and they know that it's not because their husbands aren't sexual, it's because their husbands aren't directing their sexuality toward the woman. I'm very sympathetic about that. But it's a mutual thing, I mean the sex has collapsed and simultaneously the guy is masturbating to pornography. So, you can get people to stop looking at pornography, it does not, not, not get them to have more sex with their partners. That's like saying, you know, we're going to take away your ice cream so you'll eat more broccoli. It doesn't work. But that's what a lot of therapists do. 

00:51:00
RICH SIMON So, what about, I mean the arguments made a bit of an issue, uh, not so long ago, about pornography and somebody wrote a, the lead author had a good, had been a, had a, a, uhm, positive '60s sexual liberation attitude about pornography until fairly recently, and this is a, uh, a woman author and she had begun to feel that, uhm, pornography had become for many people, had this addictive power and that, uh, and sort of the themes and the aggressiveness of pornography was something she felt as a therapist she needed to take a stand about. So her attitude about pornography had shifted. What do you think, what do you think about that? I'm sure those are, those are positions that you encounter in your, in the community. What's your response to that? 

00:51:50
MARTY KLEIN Well you know we can talk about the facts or we can talk about opinions, uh, everybody's got an opinion and I don't want to go toe to toe with other people's opinions because I'm an expert and I actually have information and the information is that the overwhelming majority of pornography is violent. The overwhelming majority of pornography shows people doing stuff that patients come to us and they say can you please help us have a sexual relationship just like that? So, the idea that some pornography is violent, it's pointless. I mean, so what? So what? And people talk about how pornography causes this kind of behavior or that kind of behavior, the federal statistics on this are very, very clear. Since the year 2000, when pornography became free and piped into everybody's house in America, the rate of sexual assault has gone down, the rate of divorce has gone down, the rate of teen pregnancy has gone down, the rate of child molestation has gone down. Every indicator of social pathology around sexuality and intimacy in relationships has gone down. Now I'm not claiming that pornography has made those things go down, but, but anybody who says that pornography causes rape, needs to answer a very simple question. The F-B-I claims that in the last 11 years, as the, as the amount of pornography in America has gone up, the amount of rape has gone down. How do you explain that, if you believe that pornography causes rape? It's real simple, it doesn't and that's not just in America, that's in countries around the world. Czech, the Czech Republic, Japan, Denmark, uh, Croatia. The research is all over the place. I think a lot of what's going on with porn is that today's couples expect, have much higher expectations around sexuality than previous generations. You know, you and I are part of the first generation in human history that expects to live a long time, and be sexual all of our lives, and to have great sex with the same person. You and I are the first, first generation to expect those three things and there have been a couple of generations since us. It turns out that that's not so easy to accomplish. It turns out that most healthy couples, when they're 56 years old, they don't have incredible wild sex twice a week. And we're being pressured from all sides, the successful aging people and the, uh, you know, the fashion industry and, and television and everything else. You know, that, you know, use it or lose it or we should all you know, be so hot sexually and we should all have this great sex all the time with the same person we've been with for thirty years, or ten years. It turns out that that's not so common. It's not so easy, it's not so common and frankly there's other things that people enjoy in life too, like going for a hike or playing Scrabble. So, I think that pornography comes along and on the mass level that it's, that it's available now, people want to blame it for a lot of things. Women want to blame pornography the fact that they don't feel good about their bodies anymore. You know, don't blame pornography for that, I mean even without pornography, anytime you walk out the door, there's lots and lots of 23 year olds who are in skimpy clothes. You don't need pornography to look at pretty girls, right? So… 

00:55:45
RICH SIMON We just have a few minutes left here, Marty, so as a last thing, uhm, and I want to make people aware of some resources and, uh, other ways if they want to follow up on, uh, this perspective you're offering in some of the training opportunities and so on. So, uh, just to kind of sum this up. So if people, uhm, listening to this, if they want to enhance their ability to be helpful to couples who are coming in and sexual issues are part of how they're presenting their selves, if you had a, uh, had to mention one or two things that you think would be most helpful, most crucial for people to expand their capacity to be, to, to deal with sexuality in the consulting room. What would it come down to? What kind of advice would you have to offer the people watching to today's interview. 

00:56:40
MARTY KLEIN Treat sex the way you treat everything else, assuming you're a good therapist. If you're not a good therapist, go become a good therapist. Treat sex like you treat everything else and if you find yourself asking a question or making an interpretation or saying something, uhm, about sex, ask yourself would I be saying the exact same thing if the subject was something else. If the answer is no, ask yourself why. 

00:57:05
RICH SIMON Okay, great. So, uh, last bit of business. Uh, if, if people want find out more about the, the world according to Marty Klein and some thoughts about dealing, doing therapy as well as sex therapy, uh, where do they go? Where are the training resources? 

00:57:25
MARTY KLEIN Well let's see, my website is W-W-W dot sex ed dot org. We should have that running across the bottom of the screen. Right? Sex ed. 

00:57:30
RICH SIMON So people can find it there but, but, uh, that's a good, uh, that'll start them off. 

00:57:35
MARTY KLEIN Sex ed dot org and, uhm, my new book is, uh, Sexual Intelligence, uh, I have to remember the title now. Sexual Intelligence, colon, what people really want from sex and how to get it. And there's, uhm, there's a chapter in there especially directed toward therapists but the whole book it's just full of cases where I talk about, uhm, uh, how the case starts out looking like one thing sexually and it ends up being about something else. So it's Sexual Intelligence is the name of the book, uh, out from Harper Collins. 

00:58:10
RICH SIMON Okay, great. Uhm, so and also I just want to make, uh, people aware again at the bottom of your screen you'll see a comment board, so if you have reactions to the interview, you have questions, you, uh, have free association, whatever it is. 

00:58:30
MARTY KLEIN I don't know about free associations Rich. 

00:58:30
RICH SIMON Uh, with, with you I think free associations are, truly are a very liberating way of inviting people to, uh, say things they might not otherwise say. Whatever it is, uh, please, uhm, let's extend this conversation that Marty has, uh, has started off for us and, uh, and he has graciously agreed to go up and look at the board, the comment board and, uh, if a spirit moves him, to respond to some of that. Sir, thank you so much for this conversation, just, uh, just very lively, very liberating, very informative on behalf of, of, uh, the people part of the webcast, I really want to thank you. 

00:59:10
MARTY KLEIN Thank you Rich. 

00:59:15
RICH SIMON And that's it for Who's Afraid of Couple's Therapy for this afternoon. Bye bye for now. 

00:59:15
