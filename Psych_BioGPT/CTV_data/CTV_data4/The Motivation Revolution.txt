The Motivation Revolution David Burns, MD. Adjunct Clinical Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Stanford Medical School 

00:00:00
 Welcome everyone. It is my pleasure, ah, to introduce, ah, Dr. David Burns who is not only, ah, Professor Emeritus at Stanford University and not only a bestselling author of millions of books and topic of therapy and not the, ah, considered one of the leading experts in cognitive therapy. He's also a really nice person, a good man with some really interesting ideas and it seems that, ah, ah, there's some new ideas emerging, ah, and will be looking forward to hearing about those as, ah, Dr. Burns talks to us about the Motivation Revolution. Please join me and welcome him. 

00:00:45
DR. DAVID BURNS Well, thank-- thank you so much for, for coming and, uhm, I wanna thank Jeff, ah, Zeig for, ah, giving me the chance to present at this fantastic, ah, program it's, it's a real honor, ah, and I feel very, very humble to be here. I'm gonna be talking little bit about, ah, what I'm calling the motivation revolution. They have to tell you flee-- about my best buddy, uhm, this is Ob(ph) and he, ah, he came to our back door as a feral-- a full grown feral cat. He'd been living in the woods behind our house. Ah, he came about two years ago and his left, ah, was swollen as big as his head. And he saw we had other cats and it was ver-- really raining and cold and I think he realized he, he wasn't gonna make it. And so he kinda-- force himself to come to the back door and leave weak. We captured him and brought him to the vet where they did surgery and he had puncture wound in his foot. They cleaned it up and, ah, gave him antibiotics but when he was, he was on horrible shape when he came to us, he was emaciated and he was covered with scabs and scars and ticks, and fleas and he had worms. And he was incredibly paranoid, he was a wild animal you couldn't get really within 20 feet of them. But it seem like he kinda wanted us to adopt him and, ah, he's turned at, at a sweetest little guy in the world. Ah, we, we were told that a feral cat can never learn to trust more than one human being but he is just-- I have a evening training groups at Stanford and then anyone who wants who can come to my house Sunday mornings, we hike from nine to 12 and do personal work and, and practice, practice different therapy techniques and treat people on the hike. And then we have dinner on the back deck or at lunch on a back deck from 12 to one and we continue to talk shop so to speak. And, ah, Ob(ph) comes and really works the crowd and he, he's as friendly with everybody. He gets on my chest at night, at the middle of the night. He needs me and then he starts to drooling and pour in. And if you've never, ah, then a cat lover you don't know the, the joy of cat drool. Then he shakes his head it's so much drool, he shake-- it's like a cat drool shower. But he's taught me a tremendous amount-- ah, about life and also about psychotherapy. He's been one of my best teachers has taught me the, the value of, ah, compassion and patience and persistence. The neighbors call him the miracle cat and he-- now he's just like a, a house cat, ah, you, you'd never know he, he'd been, ah, been a wild animal. So that's, that's my, my little Ob(ph) and I just love him to death. And-- now, uhm, what-- what's this about the motivation revolution. 

00:04:00
Cognitive Revolution vs. the Motivation Revolution • The Cognitive Revolution - You FEEL the way you THINK • Epictetus, Low, Ellis, and Beck • The Motivation Revolution - Motivation also plays an enormous role in how we think, feel, and behave • Freud, Erikson Cognitive Revolution vs. the Motivation Revolution • Integrating cognitive and motivational techniques these can often produce amazing results 

00:04:00
DR. DAVID BURNS Well, I was really thrilled, uhm, in the 1970s to learn about what was then the new emerging cognitive therapy, the cognitive revolution that really goes back to probably all the way to Buddha but then Epictetus, uhm, talk about people are disturbed not by events but by the views we, we take of now. Uhm, the, the idea that are-- our thoughts create our emotional reality and that any-- in this century Abraham Low is the first to pick up on that with his, ah, recovery incorporated and then in the 1950 is, ah, Albert Ellis pick up on it with his Rational Emotive therapy and then back pick up on it in the '60s and '70s with, ah, cognitive therapy. And this has really, ah, lead to a revolution in psychotherapy and then research. When I wrote Feeling Good, cognitive therapy was virtually unknown, now it's one of the most widely practiced forms of psychotherapy in the world. But I think there is, ah, cognitive therapy has gr-- has been great. It's, it's fantastic, I love it as much today as I did when I was first learning about it and helping to develop many of the cognitive therapy techniques. But, it's not the answer for everyone and for every situation that-- I've come to see it as you know, pure gold but not, but not everything. And I'm gonna be talking today about the motivation revolution and this is based on the idea that motivation also plays an enormous role in how think, feel and behave. And then I'm gonna about the resistance. And of course this has a long tradition too going back to, to Freud and coming up all the way to Erickson. Many therapist have, have focused on, on resistance and they ha-- have attempted to help clients overcome, ah, resistance. Now, ah, what-- what we've seen essentially to make my, my talk brief is, is we become to integrate powerful new motivational techniques with cognitive techniques as well as techniques for many other schools of therapy. And what we're saying is that integrating these two completely different ways of dealing with clients can often produce amazing results and it seems, seems to address some of the-- what I, I think are some of the, ah, ah, deficiencies not only in cognitive therapy but in virtually every other school of therapy. Now, the way I got into it, I'm gonna give you a little bit of research at, ah, to-- hope to get a little research credibility so you see I'm not just making stuff up. 

00:06:55
New Research on Depression • Self-Help Inventory - Listed 45 coping behaviors • Frequency - How often do you do this when you're depressed? • Helpfulness - How helpful do you think it would be? • Willingness - How willing would you be to give it a try, if suggested by a therapist or trusted friend? 

00:06:55
DR. DAVID BURNS But then I'm gonna give you some, ah, vignettes because I, I know that's where your heart it, and how, how does this work with real clients who are suffering. But in the 19-- I, I left full-time research career at pen, ah, I was supposed to be doing brain research and I'm-- I got really excited about cognitive therapy and, and decided to have life instead of private practice. But in my practice I always collect the data and, and, and began to do research as well kind of research to find out why, why does therapy work? Why does therapy fail? What, what are the effective ingredients in, in psychotherapy? And in the '80s, ah, coping was a big buzz word and, ah, so I wanted to do a little research on coping and then someone had developed a kind of, ah, coping inventory. And I modified it, I called it the self-help inventory and it listed 45 things that people do when they're depressed or upset. Things like you know, ah, do something pleasurable or rewarding, or talk things over with a friend or you know, various things like that. And I administer this to a couple hundred, ah, depressed women and I ask them three things about each coping behavior. How often do you do this when, when you're depressed? Ah, I also ask them, how helpful do you think it would be if you try this strategy when you're feeling down or depressed? And the final question is, how willing would be to try this if a therapist or a trusted friend suggested that? So the, the frequency scale was kind of separated the pacifications from the super copers. People who are real active versus people who are real passive when they are depressed. The helpfulness is a cognitive scale, how, how much do you believe that something is gonna help you. And the willingness was a motivational scale. How willing would you be to try this out? 

00:08:55
Results • All three scales (Behavioral, Cognitive, and Motivational) were correlated with depression • More depressed individuals - Used fewer coping behaviors - Had lower expectations that coping would help - Were less willing to try new coping behaviors 

00:08:55
DR. DAVID BURNS Now in pi-- in a pilot study that we published, all three scales were correlated with three depression. As you can imagine, ah, wo-- women who tended to use more coping strategies were less depressed, ah, for those who believe that coping strategies were help-- would help them as with those who are willing. But correlations tell us nothing about causality and causality is the only thing of importance to a researcher or to a clinician. And so to find out if any of these things had causal effects on recovery from depression. I did a longitudinal study at my clinic with several hundred depressed patients. And study them, ah, intake and again 12 weeks later. And I administer these scales both at intake and at the 12-week evaluation along with the scales for depression and anxiety and other emotional states. And-- so the question is, do any of these things cause people to recover more quickly? And I might say and all the world literature I'm not aware of any study that's ever shown something to have a causal effect on depression or on recovery from depression. 

00:10:15
Results (cont'd) • Only the Willingness scale predicted changes in depression • Strong antidepressant effect - Appears to be mediated by psychotherapy homework (HW) - Consistent with clinical experience 

00:10:20
DR. DAVID BURNS It turns out that only the willingness scale predicted changes and depression at the clinic. And the magnitude of the effect was massive, it wasn't a small or moderate causal effect but it was huge causal effect. Uhm, in addition, the causal effect of willingness on recovery from depression appeared to be mediated by the amount of psychotherapy homework that patients were doing. Ah, I love the results of this study because it was consistent with my clinical research, ah, and my clinical experience because we, we-- I-- we published the number of longitudinal studies and journal of consulting a clinical psychology. And we found that virtually every patient who did psychotherapy homework recover and virtually every patient who refused to do psychotherapy homework not only didn't recover most deteriorated or dropped out of therapy. 

00:11:20
Results (cont'd) • Replicated in five different samples - Inpatients and outpatients • First variable in the world literature that has been show to have robust and consistent casual effects on depression - Burns, D. Westra, H., Trockel, M., & fisher, A. (2012) Motivation and Changes in Depression, Cognitive Therapy and Research DOI 10.1007/s10608-012-9458-3 Published online 22 April 2012 Willingness and Changes in Depression 

00:11:25
DR. DAVID BURNS Uhm, now sometimes you get a result that's because it's something you wanna believe and you kinda play with your data and it, it is-- it's not valid. So replication is a key thing, can other investigators get the same result. And the study is now been replicated in five independent, ah, samples. And it's, it's and I believe-- I believe this is the first variable willingness that's been shown to really have causal effects on depression. Uhm, oops! I'm going the wrong direction here. Ah, we, we, we recently, ah, also tested at, at the Stanford Hospital with a 170 consecutively admitted patients, right after admission we gave them the, the willingness test. I, I've now-- it, it was originally a 135 item test, now we've condense it to a little five item test that patients can complete in 15 seconds. And in the Stanford Hospital, the patients are only getting biological treatment for the most part, electroconvulsive therapy, massive doses of antidepressants but there's not much emphasis on psychotherapy. But we recently publish this in the journal of, ah, cognitive therapy and research showing the two blue graphs here with the 70s, that-- that's two patients who come in. One has a high willingness score at admission and one has a low willingness score at admission. And the patients, ah, with the high willingness scores at admission were almost completely symptom free one week later. The patients with a low willingness scores were had hardly any, ah, improvement at all. And that was remarkable at, at-- and that suggested even in, in the place like Stanford Hospital where everything is biological psychiatry, the recovery is actually being mediated not by biological factors but by this powerful psychosocial, ah, variable. So, once I saw that, I began to develop, ah, motivational techniques to see if we could not only assess patients resistance at, at the-- at the initial evaluation but also melt away resistance to see could that have a dramatic accelerating effect on recovery.

British CoBalT Trial • 469 chronically depressed patients randomly assigned to - Usual care (antidepressants) - Usual care plus CBT • Improvement defined as 50% reductions in BDI scores Six-Month Evaluation • Percent achieving improvement - 22% of usual care patients - 46% of usual care plus CBT • CBT improved outcomes - Results in both groups were unimpressive - Lancet, doi: 10.1016/S0104-6736(12)61552-9. Epub 2012 Dec 7 

00:13:45
DR. DAVID BURNS Now, one other better research I want to draw your attention to, ah, was the British CoBalT Trial. They took 469 chronically depressed patients and randomly assign them to treatment as usual. This is how-- this was in Britain but it's much the same in the US. Treatment is usual was antidepressants most often prescribed by the, ah, family physician fa-- ah, internal medicine doctor, the family practiced doctor. And after the patients were assigned to, ah, anti-depressing-- usual care plus cognitive behavior therapy, improvement was to find as a 50% reduction and scores on the back depression inventory, ah, ah, over something like 16 weeks. Uhm, now, ah, and I-- the, the research will come to an end soon so, ah, keep Pope alive. Ah, the interesting thing was that 22% of the usual care patients, ah, achieved improvement, 46% who got cognitive therapy plus usual care achieved improvement. Uhm, to me, the-- this shows two things that the cognitive therapy helped a little but not very much. Uhm, and I think if you had substituted any form of psychotherapy, ah, you would have the same result. You see 40% of the patients who got this best possible care, ah, had a 50% reduction and symptoms. Well, to me a 50% reduction and symptoms on the back test is lousy. Someone could go from, ah, ah, 40 on that test to a 20 on that testing and be called clinically improved. But a 20 on the back depression inventory is a, is very, ah, su-- substantial depression. And what it seems to, to show is that there's something missing in, in cognitive therapy but why, why is something to 90%, ah, you know, of people getting a 90% reduction. Why, why is it so, so small and I again I don't mean to condemn cognitive therapy, here I love cognitive therapy. And I, I am absolutely certain that any form of psychotherapy could not have done better than this because I think it's-- there's something missing from every single form of psychotherapy not only for depression, the last was on marital therapy. There's an important to mention missing from every school of marital therapy and as-- the same on the treatment of anxiety and the same and, and habits on addictions. And that's the motivational component, and so along with my colleagues, at Stanford we've developed a new approach to therapy , it-- it's not a new school of therapy. I'm, I'm kind of against to all schools of therapy. Ah, I think they compete like cults like religious cults. And, ah, they all claimed to have the right answer and the best technique. 

00:16:50
What is TEAM Therapy? • T = Testing • E = Empathy • A = (Paradoxical) Agenda Setting • M = Methods 

00:16:50
DR. DAVID BURNS We're developing a data-driven form of therapy that draws on many schools of, of therapy and we call it T-E-A-M. And in my workshops I'll go into it in more detail, I'm just gonna go on the A. I'll tell you about the paradoxical agenda setting which is the motivational piece but testing means we've now test patients at the beginning and end of every single therapy session. We test them with brief mood scales, how depressed are you at this moment and they take at the waiting room before the session and again after the session. So we can see right away how effective the session was. They also rate therapist on empathy, on helpfulness and a variety of other dimension. It's like having an x-ray machine for the first time and you can see exactly how effective you are or aren't and every single session whether you're treating marital problems or depression, or panic disorder or whatever. Empathy, the E, ah, is empathy and of course every patient needs empathy at the beginning of a session. A time when you just listen and, and go the gates of hell with the patient, you don't try to rescue the patient, you don't try to save the patient that's what the afternoon workshop will be on this afternoon. But then we have plugged in A which is paradoxical agenda setting and that's what I'm gonna tell you about today. That's where you bring the patient subconscious resistance to conscious awareness, right away you can do this the first time you meet with the patient and then melt that resistance away before trying any kinds of, of methods. Ah, so that, that's, that's kind of the, the overview. 

00:18:30
A = (Paradoxical) Agenda Setting • The Most Important Key to Therapeutic Success or Failure 

00:18:30
DR. DAVID BURNS Paradoxical Agenda Setting, I believe is the most important key to therapeutic success or failure. And as I mentioned, it's missing from almost every school of therapy, it's a thing that weren't taught how to do in, in graduate school. And I wasn't taught how to do this in, in psychiatric residency either. I was taught how to help people. Now our last speaker was talking about marital problems. She was telling you how to help people and that's in general and she, she did a beautiful job but in, but in general that's the whole thrust of our field. What-- whether some empirically proven techniques to help a patient based on their diagnosis or some characteristic they have were always pushing something on, on the patient without taking to look at the idea, maybe there's a part of the patient that doesn't, doesn't want to change. Maybe there's a part of the patient that, that is invested in the status quo and, and maybe that the patient's resistance is, is not some neurotic, ah, pathetic thing about them but maybe their resistance is coming from their basic values from the, the most beautiful and awesome part of that. Oh, we're going the wrong direction. 

00:19:45
Goals of Agenda Setting • Bring resistance to conscious awareness • Melt away the resistance and make the patient accountable before trying to help the patient - The failure to do this is BY FAR the most common cause of therapeutic failure Two Types of Resistance • Outcome Resistance - Concept of Magic Button • Process Resistance - There is no Magic Button 

00:19:45
DR. DAVID BURNS So that's what agenda setting is, is, is dealing with resistance and making the patient accountable before you, you try to help the patient using any, ah, therapeutic technique that you might ha-- have been trained on. And if you can melt away the patient's resistance it's like-- in psychotherapy on steroids and you began to see mind-blowing effects, people recovering at speeds that 10 years ago I would have said-- you said-- I would have said that's impossible for people to change that quickly. Uhm, now there's two kinds of resistance. Now, outcome resistance and process resistance. Outcome resistance means that the patient doesn't want to a good outcome for the therapy. Ah, ah, very simple example of that would be as referred by the courts for driving while drunk and as doctor tells me he's going and delivery failure and as wife's telling blacks out and gets file on. And so he's coming for the treatment of alcoholism and you might say them, "Well, here's a magic button. If you press that magic button you'll be instantly cured, you won't have to go to AA meetings. You'll never take another drink?" Will he press that button? Thank you my friends. Is it-- what-- what do think? Is, is this-- no, of course he's not because he's in love with his drinking. He, he doesn't see his drunkenness as a problem, he sees it as the greatest thing in his life. Now, there's another form of outcome resistance associated with anxiety. Another type associated with relationships problems and another type I'll talk about associated with, with depression. Now, now process resistance is different from outcome resistance. Process resistance is there is no magic button so the patients gonna have to do something that he or she doesn't wanna do in order to bring a good result about. And so we are trying melt away both kinds of resistance as quickly as possible at the beginning of the therapeutic intervention. Then, if the patient collaborates with you and gets on the same team with you, you have a very powerful, ah, almost impossible to defeat, ah, treatment team. 

00:22:10
Outcome and Process Resistance • Will be different for - Depression - Anxiety - Relationship problems - Habits and addictions • Eight completely different types of resistance Depression Resistance in a Nutshell • Outcome Resistance - You'll have to accept something about yourself or the world that you won't want to accept • Process Resistance - You'll have to do psychotherapy homework Outcome Resistance Example - Depression • The woman who thought she'd murdered her baby 

00:22:10
DR. DAVID BURNS Now, I wanna mention that outcome and process resistance differ completely for depression, anxiety, relationship problems and habits on addictions. So, there's eight completely different patterns of resistance. The outcome and process resistance for each piece or targets. Now, for depression, outcome resistance, uhm, the, the essence of this is that you're gonna have to accept something about yourself or the world that, that you won't want to accept. Uhm, process resistance is that, that you're gonna have to do psychotherapy homework if you want to get over the depression. Now let's, let's see how this would play out with the actual phase. I'm gonna disguise, ah, identity on some occasions, ah, to protect, protect their confidentiality, I'm sure all the speakers do that but this is a, a woman who was raised let say in Honduras and emigrated to the United States. And, ah, came to me at the age of 27 with 10 years of refractory, intractable depression. She had taken every known antidepressant and have, ah, all kinds of psychotherapy that had been totally ineffective. She, ah, -- as young woman she'd had some, some sexual abuse. Ah, she carried a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder in addition to severe chronic depression. The, ah, the initial evaluation, uhm, I ask her what is the thought that's, that's going through your mind when you're depressed? What are you telling yourself? I want to take a bit of a cognitive therapy perspective. Well, she'd had an abortion at age 18 and she said she had the thought, "Ah, I murdered my baby. I deserve to suffer forever because I murdered my baby." Now, in spite of the depression, she-- after the abortion, she went to UCLA. She had, ah, she got married, she had, ah, several children and she was doing well in marketing, ah, working for a pharmaceutical firm as a product manager, but had horrific levels of self-hatred, ah, depression, guilt, shame. And she was also very lonely because when she would try to tell her, her husband or her parents, "I deserve to suffer forever because I murdered my baby." They would tell her, listen women have abortions all the time, get over it, you know, try to cheer, cheer her up which only angered her and pushed her into a deeper depression. And she ask me, was there any hope for someone as severe as she was. As I said to her, let's call her Janice(ph). I said you know, Janice(ph) different emotions some are easy to overcome and some are very difficult to overcome. Anger is the toughest one because it makes us feel so powerful and so morally superior when were an-- when we're angry. Guilt and shame are easiest emotions to overcome. I-- and I said, ah, your main feelings here were guilt and shame and, and I have no doubt that if we work together I can show you how to overcome those feelings and maybe even quickly and now that I had her list of 50 techniques that we've developed for helping people overcome negative thoughts and negative feelings. And she looked at the list and she never heard of any of these techniques, the externalization of voices, the acceptance paradox, the downward arrow technique, the hidden emotion techniques and all of these. And say, "Yeah, this looks, this looks terrific." But then I said, "But, but Janice(ph) I'm not sure I can accept you as my patient. I don't know if it would be ethical, ah, to show-- to teach you these techniques. As much as I would love to work with you I, I, I'm not convince that's the thing to do." And she said, "Well, why not Dr. Burns. I, I've been suffering for 10 years, if you've got all these techniques and if you think they won't work that's unfair. You-- you'd have to accept me. But why won't you accept me as your patient?" I noticed right of, I'm not chasing her, I'm, I'm letting her know maybe we should work together. And that I did what's, what's called becoming the voice of the patients resistance. You try to become the part of patient that doesn't want to change. And I said, "Well, Janice(ph) it's not that I don't wanna work with you and I hope I can. I hope we will work together. It would be a real joy. But, but here is my problem, uhm, I'm reluctant to treat you because I respect you too much. You see, it seems to me that yours is a spiritual depression as much as it is a psychological depression. You're telling me that you deserve to suffer because you murdered your, your baby. And I have tremendous respect for you and the position, the position that you've taken. You're saying I'm not just gonna blow this away. I, I love that little boy and, and, and you're still grieving-- you're still grieving he-- his loss. And if you wanted me to work with you, you'd have to convince me that it would be, ah, morally justified. What would be the spiritual justification of our working together?" Now, who has become Janice(ph)? Did you see that? I-- and, and this-- I was and trained to do this, I was trained to throw help at people rather to become a patient and reflect to the patient may-- maybe, maybe recovery from depression isn't, isn't, isn't gonna affect with your values. Now, the odd thing is that once you do this, if you do it skillfully and in a compassionate way, the patient-- well, 95% of the time jump to the opposite side. And what she said is, "Yes but, but doctor, couldn't we look at it this way? Co-- even prisoners, they let out a prison after 10 years. And couldn't we say I-- I've struggled enough, I've suffered enough. And couldn't we say that if, if we use these techniques and I overcame my depression I'd have more love from husband, more love from children, more creativity at work?" And I said, "Okay, Ja-- Ja-- Janice(ph) you've, you've convince me of that. Ah, that, that sounds fine. But there's, there's one other thing I forgot to mention to you." She said, "What that?" I said, "Ah, the, the other problem is you see that little boy hasn't died yet. You've been keeping alive for, for 10 years and his, his with you every moment of everyday. And if, if you wanted me to work with you, you'd have to be willing to, to, to grieve and, and, and let go and, and say good bye to him so you could move forward with your life and you-- you'd been hanging onto tho-- that grief and those tears. Your depression as your love for him. Ah, are, are you ready to say good bye?" And then she just burst, burst into tears and that grief that she'd been holding onto came, came out. We worked together, she was extremely motivated as a patient, worked hard, did her homework. We finally found a technique that worked for her. I tried many techniques that weren't effective. I, I try to fail five or six times every session because of the 18th technique works for a patient. If I can fail five times a session then within four sessions we'll finally find the technique that works for a patient. The technique that works for her, I never would have predicted. But when we found the right technique her depression completely vanished. At-- if I had not, become the voice of her resistance, I, I would have had the same losing battle that every other therapist had. Let me give you another example.

Outcome Resistance Exercise • Severely depressed, suicidal heroin dealer/addict with Explosive Personality Disorder - "I'm a hopeless case, and there's NOTHING you can do it about!" 

00:30:50
DR. DAVID BURNS When I was-- I'm, ah, grateful to be back home in California, uhm, happened the Bay Area my wife was born and we used there-- and I spent seven years at Stanford, ah, are during medical school and after medical school and then eventually, ah, round up in, in Philadelphia. And, ah, it was our dream always to make it back to California and we're back now and I, I just thank God every morning when I wake up I don't even wanna go on vacation anymore cuz I feel like I'm an-- in vacation every single day. But when I was in Philadelphia, I moved my office to an inner city hosp-- ah, hospital, Presbyterian Medical Center. Everyone there had to be on the voluntary faculty at University of Pennsylvania or the full-time faculty but it was, ah, it was a kind of a gang warfare area. And, ah, they had a new office building and I, I needed more office space so I moved over there. And the hospital president asked if I would create a department of psychiatry for them. And, ah, ah, as I had know they had medicine and surgery, and all of that but they had no psychiatry. And I said, "Well, yes. I'd-- I'll, I'll be glad to create a department of psychiatry for you and I'll do it as part of my volunteer work. You won't even have to pay me but I'd like to do an experimental kind of, ah, psychiatry, do things in a radically new and different way." And I said, "There's been a lot of research on my book Feeling Good that shows the two-thir-- if you just hand the book to someone whose depressed, two-thirds of them will show dramatic improvement for weeks and most of them-- most of those will not even require any further treatment." And there'd been many outcome studies, ah, by (inaudible ) and other show-- showing this and with teenagers, elderly people, people of all ages. And they said, I bet I could create, ah, a group program here that would be even more effective than handing people the, the book. And we'll treat everyone in group from outlaw and an individual psychotherapy. And, and we'll treat people not with an hour or week but we'll give everyone a minimum of 70 hours a week of treatment. And we're gonna-- we'll treat everybody in groups. And it was a phenomenal, ah, experience. It was the most, ah, joyous program I've ever been associated with. We treated mainly homeless people, ah, people from the lower, ah, area-- strata of life. The quarter of our patients couldn't read or write. And the first year alone I think we put, ah, 8,000 patients through this, through this program. Ah, and it was, it was a fantastic experience. And we created a manual that we gave all the patients when they came in called Ten days to self-esteem. And then there was leaders manual for the-- we just got people from the community to run the groups and then psychologists, ah, supervised the, the group leaders. They've kinda train them how to run these groups. And, and I would go in every week or two to run a group just to see how it was working because my colleagues said, "Oh, cognitive therapy would never work for these people. All they care about is where-- where's their next meal gonna come from." They, they don't want some brainy intellectual thing like cognitive therapy. But the opposite was true. I've never had a population that was so easy to work with and so emotionally rewarding to work with. They were so grateful for what the hospital was doing wi-- for them. But just to show-- show you another example of resistance. Uhm, one day I went in, I was gonna do the two to 5 p.m. group and the, the nurses would tell me about a couple of the patients and the group to be where of as I was just coming in. I wasn't on the staff of the unit, I was just tech creative of the program. And I was helping to administer it. And they said there's this one guy in your group today, his name Benny(ph) and he's, uhm, we, we know of him, he's from the local, ah, community here and he's violent, ah, drug dealer. And, ah, he's, he's very explosive and we think he would have the potential to really hurts-- hurt somebody or even kill somebody. And whatever you do, don't share on his-- Benny(ph). And I said, "Oh, well, don't worry I won't confront Benny(ph)." And, uhm, so I went in to-- it was about 15 in the group and there was this young guy facing about behind the group. And he, he look like he was from an Italian guy from South Philadelphia. And he had his sleeves rolled up a t-shirt and a cigarettes rolled up in his sleeves and they had these tattoos all over him like death and things like that. And I, I, I figured out, well that must be Benny(ph), ah, and I said, "Benny(ph), would you like to sit and, and join us in one of the, one of the chairs in the circle?" And he said he wasn't about to sit in one of the F'NGD chairs and he wanted to know what I intended to do about it. And so he had staring at me, the, the group was 10 seconds old and I was already involved in full-blown transference-- countertransference kind of thing and all the group members were staring at me. Ah, what's, what's the good doctor gonna do? So I said, "Well, Benny(ph) there's only one rule that we have here in group. And the rule is that during the group, you have to sit in one of chairs, or stand and face about, or both." And if he stand and face them out, you've gotta stay in the room so you're gonna hear what's going on or face about out in the hall or both. And as long as you obey that rule you'll get along just fine. Well, this quieted him down that he wouldn't in the chair and he kept pacing back and forth staring at me in this, ah, evil way. At the beginning of the group, we ask the patients their scores on this little brief mood test that I developed so we can see where everyone is out and the patient shout out how they're scoring the depression, the suicide test, the anger test that type of thing. When I came to Benny(ph) and they had-- they would fill it out in their workbooks you know, the-- then we tested them actually four times a day. And when I came to Benny(ph), ah, and I said and, "What, what are your scores on the test Benny(ph)?" And, and he said he wasn't about to, to tell me what his scores on the gdf'n test were. And I said, "Well, Benny(ph) could I at least look at your workbook?" And then confidentially I'll write them down that way I won't embarrass you, you won't have to say your scores out loud. And he said if I tried to look at his workbook, ah, I was gonna be in big trouble. Ah, ah, f'n trouble. So I said, "Uhm, well, Benny(ph), ah, look at-- would you just tell me your score in one of the tests?" Ah, that's a-- that's a compromise. He says, "Okay, my score on, on your gdf'n depression test was 78." So I wrote it down and I'm thinking, and I said, well, Benny(ph) you have-- you're the most severe-- severely depressed person in the room right now, and, and I was thinking the test only goes from four-- to 45 you know. His score is literally off the church. So, uhm, ah, I started working with this woman who thought she was a bad mother because she, she had been hospitalized and her husband had to take care of her children and the nurses had told me about her too that she's very self-blaming and she's actually a good mother, beautiful person, just horribly depressed. And she was telling herself I should have been stronger, I shouldn't have gotten depressed, I'm letting my family down, my children will feel abandon, this type of thing. And I used the technique, the thing I demonstrate in the workshop tomorrow called the, the role play, Double-Standard Technique. And it work like a child for her and, and then 20 minutes her depression pretty much disappeared and that's why I like working in a group because when patient see that going on they say I want some of that too. It, it has a kind of an infectious, ah, effect that much rather, ah, train people in groups and treat people in groups. You know, whenever, whenever I-- whenever I can. And, and it was so inspiring I, I decided to do a little rap. It's a 10-step program and this was te-- step seven was called self-esteem. What is it? How do I get it? How do I get rid of it once I've got it? And so, ah, I was talking about self-esteem and they said, you know, a lot of us we, we, we don't have self-esteem, we're depressed because we beat up on ourselves. We tell us-- tell our ourselves, ah, you know, I'm not as good as I should be. And then we go onto there-- how many of you do that to yourself some-- sometimes? Put, put your hands up. Ah, how many of you were not as good as you should be? Like, I wanna all the, the defective types. Yeah. Right. And so, and, and, and I, and I ask the, the people in group. What-- what's going on with you when you feel you, you, you don't have self-esteem and the, the different people started telling their stories and cry. And then it was very, very moving. One was a homeless person and he said he had low self-esteem, he's living-- sleeping on the streets, he sees people walk by and they have a suit and tie. And he says, he's probably got a wife who loves and he has a home to go to. He-- he is contributing to society. I, I'm a worthless human being. I've never had a job one day in my life. I'm just, I'm just scum and nobody even knows who I am or where I am. And then he would sob and-- then I start talking about how we all do this to ourselves. We beat up on ourselves. Ah, ah, and, and that the secret of self-esteem, it's a gift you give yourself. You can earn it by being loved, by being intelligent, by being wealthy, by being successful. It-- it's some-- it's something unconditional. And I said that's what happened with, with Melissa(ph). Who was telling herself she was a bad mother. She made the decision, made the choice to treat herself in a loving way and then that moment her depression disappeared. And people were really getting it. And then that-- and I thought this was a great group and then Benny(ph) started shouting at me. And, and he's-- he's saying, "As I'm so sick and tired hearing about your, your you know, what you have to do to be worthwhile. And, and you've got to be a good little boy. And you've got to be real smart, you've got to have high grades and you have to do what everybody tells you to do. And doc, as far as I'm concerned, you can-- you can take your self-esteem and stick it up to your f'n ass." And, and I felt a little on the spot again. And, ah, and the reason I'm telling you this story is because we're dealing with resistance, right? So here is someone who just that, that had of resistance. He was sick-- he was hospitalized for his own heroin addiction. His suicidal depression and his rage. And so I said you know, Benny(ph) it's really interesting what you're saying about, sticking self-esteem of my f'n ass, because that's exactly the point I was trying to make too. Ah, that-- there, there is no way you can earn self-esteem by following the rules and doing what you're-- you're supposed to, to do. Uhm, Benny(ph) in fact, uhm, you could practically be my, ah, assistant and, and help me teach this, ah, seminar today, this workshop, this group because you seemed to know this stuff already, cuz the way you're thinking Benny(ph) that's the way I think. And in fact, Benny(ph) all-- this stuff what I'm teaching to you is really basically Buddhism. This goes all the way back to the Buddha 35,000 years ago not only there's no such thing as self-esteem, there's not even any such thing as a self. That's just a bunch of but only. These are just ways we make ourselves miserable. Ah, tel-- tell me Benny(ph), were you raised as a Buddhist? And he says, "I'm no f'n Buddhist, I'm in the goddamn mafia if you wanna know the truth." And I said, "Well, Benny(ph) Buddhism and mafia, those are very similar concepts." And, at that point he ran into the circle and plop in the chair I had in the middle for role play. He's gonna sit down or you wants to be the center of attention. He says, "Okay, doc, if you're so smart, let's see if you can disprove my negative thought. You say we have this distorted thoughts, well I'll tell you my thought doc." And I said, "What's your thought?" He says, "Doc, I'm a hopeless case and there's nothing you can do about it. I've been through every drug abuse program in Philadelphia, most I've been through five times and I've flunked out every single time. And I can tell you I'm a hopeless case. How are you gonna disprove that one doc?" And so I'm going through my 50 techniques, ah, you know, which method have I gonna work with Benny(ph)? And I thought about one of the motivation techniques, a very s-- when I do by the way, uhm, when I'm thinking, uhm, and I, I think in terms of recovery circle with arrows coming out of it. 

00:44:50
I'm a hopeless case. 100% Downward Arrow Technique Experimental Technique Acceptance Paradox Externalization of Voices Let's Define Terms Double-Standard Technique Paradoxical CBA Straightforward CBA Straightforward Technique Identify the Distortions Agenda Setting Empathy Cost-Benefit Analysis "I'm a hopeless case!" Advantages Disadvantages 

00:44:50
DR. DAVID BURNS And each arrow was a different technique and I'll think about 10, 15 techniques. I used to do this on paper and it was very helpful to do on-- do it on paper. Now, I can kinda do it mentally so I was going through techniques of and then I thought, hmm, Benny(ph) seems pretty resistant maybe we need a cost-benefit analysis and maybe a paradoxical cost-benefit analysis. And I said, "You know, Benny(ph) I can easily show you that, that thought, I'm a hopeless case is false thought." But there weren't any point in doing that if you wanna believe it. And as I'm thinking about it, I can see a lot of advantages for you Benny(ph) and believe in that thought. What are some of benefits, ah, to you Benny(ph) if you tell yourself I'm a hopeless case. And he sa-- and says, "Doc, you don't know what the hell are you talking about. Uhm, I'll be dead in two years. You can count on that. You put that in you disadvantages column." So I wrote dead in two years and I, and I, and I write down, oh, this is no Benny(ph). I think your-- I think you're missing the point here. The more I think about it, telling yourself you're a hopeless case is one of the best things you can tell yourself. The benefits to you are tremendous. And then, why I like working in groups? I said, why are they group? Cuz Benny(ph) can't think of any and the other group members put their hands-- ah, what can-- I don't know if we can do this in a group this size, but can any of you think of some benefits that you could shout out? What is it? He doesn't have to do anything. It's easy that was the first one. I said, Benny(ph) here we are all working, or bunch of working in the, the, the, ah, the workbook learning these techniques. And as long as you tell yourself you're hopeless you, you don't have to do any of that work. What are some other benefits? This got not nothing to lose you. You won't get your hopes up and be disappointed them-- that's the huge benefit of hopelessness. It protects you from horrible disappointment and trying again and then just getting knock down again. What are some other benefits? What is it? I'll just tell you what some benefits-- I don't know what you're saying. It doesn't working out that way for me. I'm kind of old and deaf now so. Someone said, uhm, he can get high-- as all the time. And I said, "Yeah, Benny(ph) I, I here you're what-- the top cocaine and heroin dealer in Philadelphia. You got all the best stuff. I've never had cocaine or heroin once. And I've heard it's fantastic and you can just-- as long as you believe you're a hopeless case you can just get stoned all day long." And then someone says, "Yeah! And he's got a lot of money too." I says, "Yeah, your punk cuz your stuff with $100 bills and $50 bills." And some else said and he doesn't have to pay the IRS. So we-- there's another benefit. And then someone said, "And yeah, Benny(ph) you're the big man in the neighborhood. Everyone is afraid of you. Ah, you're, you're, you know, you have a lot of, lot of prestige." Ah, and then someone said, "Yeah, and he can be irresponsible." And I said, "Yeah! That's the joyous of being irresponsible." I said, "Benny(ph) you remind me of James Dean. Ah, in fact you're kind of the man, ah, the kind of man I always wanted to be. You know, you can ride your motorcycle, you can sell your drugs, you can do whatever you want. You make the rules. You're free, ah, the breeze. You're kind of like the cultural icon. A cultural hero. In fact, I heard that when you don't like someone, you just beat the shit out of them. And today, the truth I've always wanted to do that. But I'm not allowed to because I was a minister son. And I have just be so damn nice to everybody." I said, "What's it like Benny(ph) is this-- as much fun as it seems?" He says, "Oh, yeah, it's awesome." So we put the joys of islands in the advantages column. And then said, "I get all laid the all time you know, obviously you know, I hand some bad boy..." Testing, yup we're back. Gets all the sexy one. So on and on and on listing all these advantages, he got in to it, and people came up with this huge list of advantages. Now, are these advantages real? Does he really have heroin and cocaine? Yeah. Does he really have a lot of money? Does he really have prestige? Ah, ah, is-- are people really afraid of him? Ah, it's, it-- it's not an imaginary thing. And so, together in 10 minutes we listed, we came up with 17 advantages of telling themself I'm a hopeless case. And then, when you do it paradoxically, the way you bring it to closer, and I said to Benny(ph) is, Benny(ph) you know, 10 minutes ago, you ask for help with this thought, I'm a hopeless case. But let's look at all the benefits to you and believing that fi-- first of all there's no work involved. You can be euphoric all the time. You can have sex, unlimited sex. You have unlimited prestige. You're the top man in the neighborhood. You've got all the money you want. Ah, you can be violent with people. You're kind of like a king, or a prince. You se-- you set the rules. Everyone has to do what you tell them to do or else they're in trouble. And on, and on, and on I, I read them and I said now, "Benny(ph), right now I'm feeling really confused. Why would you wanna give all of that up? It seems to me like you've got a good thing going for you." You know, who has become Benny(ph)? Yes, I have become Benny(ph) and, and to do that you'll have to learn to let go of your training where every other therapist made the mistake of trying to help Benny(ph) and if you make that mistake, there's a 100% guarantee you will fail. In other words, the way you're-- you've been trained to treat people is guaranteed to fail. That's a bit of shock when I began to do-- to do it on me. It's not that the techniques we have aren't, aren't useful. But that if you-- push that on patients, the patients gonna push back. And what Benny(ph) said was, he soften for the first time and he says, "Doc, you read me like a book." Then he says, "Can I-- can I talk about something in the group I've never talked about before?" I said, "Yeah, Benny(ph), we'd, we'd love to hear anything you have to say." And he says, "You know, when I was a little boy the person I love most was my, my grandfather, ah, because, ah, he, he would talk, talk to me. He was the one who would spend time with me and he was a lot like me. I think like me he went in an out of severe depressions and he was in the same line of work that I'm in. But one time doc, uhm, I was sitting on the floor and he was in his chair and he was talking to be in this way. And, uhm, doc, uhm, it, it-- he was scaring me. I, I think it's wrong to do that talk like that to a little boy. Because he said that he was having trouble with the family and that there was no way out." And by the family, I don't think he be-- he meant as wife. "And doc, he had, ah, sort on-- sort of shotgun in his lap and that scared me. Ah, I don't think you should do that, ah, be like that-- talk like that with a gun in front of a little five-year-old boy. And then-- and doc he, he put the barrel in his mouth. And, and doc he pulled the trigger and he blew the back of this f'n head off." And then he started sobbing and cry and that he-- snot was coming out of his nose, and tears were going his cheeks and he was shaking and crying. And most people in the ba-- in the group just crushed and there was-- was not dry eye in the room and he quiet for several minute, minutes he'd been holding onto this ever since he was five years old. And then he looked up to me and he-- he says, "Doc, do-- do you remember-- do you remember, uhm, when you ask about the scores on the mood test I threatened you and I wouldn't let you see my workbook, I wouldn't let you see my scores on the tests?" I said, "Yeah, sure I do remember that Benny(ph). I'm-- I'm not gonna forget that for a long time." And he says, "Well doc, do you know why I threatened you?" I said, "No, Benny(ph) I just-- I just know you don't want me to look in your workbook but I don't know why you were so mad at me." And he says, "Cuz doc I can't fuckin' read or write. And I'm so ashamed of it. I didn't want the people in the group to see that about me." And then he started sobbing again. Now that's paradoxical agenda setting, just an example. It's not something that you can do as a formula. It takes a lot of training to learn how to do it because each patient will, will be different. We've developed about 15, ah, paradoxical agenda setting techniques to, to melt away resistance. But we have been astonished at how this has accelerated the speed of recovery. We're seeing many people now, we can meet with them for two hours initially or two and a half hours that we can-- and most cases get a complete elimination of symptoms. The first time we sit down with a patient, as I say 10 years ago, I would have thought that no human therapist could do that but we're beginning to see that a lot. Now, it's, it's not an answer for everybody. We don't have a panacea for all patients, for all disort-- disorders, but it has been, uhm, truly, truly a mind-boggling development that in my mind is as big or as big as the cognitive revolution, itself was. 

00:55:05
Advantages of Paradoxical Agenda Setting • High-speed change now possible for many patients • Deeper and more authentic understanding of the complexities of the patient's concerns • Transforms the patients "problems" into assets • Creates collaboration and trust Cost-Benefit Analysis "I'm a hopeless case!" Advantages Disadvantages Disadvantages of Paradoxical Agenda Setting • Difficult to learn - Conceptually challenging - Anti-intuitive - Technically challenging • Emotional challenging for the therapist - Codependency - Narcissism - Conflict Phobia - Conflicts of interest 

00:55:10
DR. DAVID BURNS Now the advantages of learning these techniques, and, and then once the resistance is melted away, you can go in with almost any techniques and they become amazingly effective. Now, the advantages is that high-speed change is now possible for many patients especially patients struggling with depression and anxiety disorders. It gives you a deeper and more authentic understanding of the complexities of the patient's concerns. And it also transforms the patients problems into assets. You that the-- the symptoms are in most cases, if not all cases reflecting something kind of beautiful and positive about the patient, I found myself liking Benny(ph). I admired Benny(ph). I, I thought he was pretty cool and he sense the-- he sense that and without that compassionate connection it would have just been a manipulation that, that would have failed. So it creates collaboration and trust. Uhm, the disadvantages of paradoxical agenda setting are that it's very difficult to learn. It's conceptually challenging because it's the opposite of wa-- the way therapist have been trained. It's anti-intuitive and then the techniques are technically quite challenging to, to learn. But it's also emotionally challenging for therapist because of our codependency and narcissism, the compulsion to help to rescue the patient. And the narcissistic need to be an expert, ah, who, who knows something. And as well as, ah, fear of conflict, ah, as well as conflicts of interest, ah, because some of my students are now in private practice and it's, it's, it's horrible for them at first because they find their patients only last three or four sessions. And then they're-- recovered and they're out of there. And whereas, if you have a more long-term type therapy you've got a full practice. Uhm, on the positive side, once the word gets out, how effective they are then they start getting tons of ref-- referrals but conflicts of interest can, can definitely be an issue in, in our field.
