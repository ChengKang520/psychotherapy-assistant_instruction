AACD Developmental Aspects of Group Counseling: Process, Leadership, and Supervision with Rex Stockton John 

00:00:00
JOHN  You know, I'm a little nervous. Uhm, I, I don't know what you, you, each of you thinks of me. You know, I just, I sit here and go on about my, my problem that I'm having. 

00:00:30
Margaret 

00:00:30
MARGARET You hearing some of the other concerns and you realize, and as you said, I guess this common thread. 

00:00:35
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:00:35
MARGARET I feel a little better. I mean I'm still not, you know, I still get the little butterflies but I feel better because I recognize that we all do. There is, that I'm gonna benefit from this even if I don't recall whatever issues I'm trying to work on... (crosstalk) 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:00:50
MARGARET ...that there will be some growth. 

00:00:50
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:00:50
MARGARET So I feel good about that. 

00:00:55
Eddie Kent 

00:00:55
REX STOCKTON Okay. That about wraps it up. We can see what we're finishing and we know how that, how that, (crosstalk) 

00:01:00
KENT Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:01:00
REX STOCKTON how that completed. So much for the replay. 

00:01:05
EDDIE Uh-huh. 

00:01:05
REX STOCKTON Well, let me look between you guys and ask you which, ah, one of you wants to start off... (crosstalk) 

00:01:10
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:01:10
REX STOCKTON ...and sort of comment on what was like for you here in the session. 

00:01:10
EDDIE  Okay. 

00:01:15
KENT Well, I'll start it out since I did it, ah, at the beginning. I'm somewhat more relaxed than I did at the beginning of, ah, this session. I'm, I'm still surprised that no matter how many groups you lead ah, when, when you start one, it's just always a little apprehensive and getting started is a little more difficult than you'd anticipate. 

00:01:35
Jamie 

00:01:35
JAMIE Part of me feels so, feels for you that you're having trouble being my partner as real angry to you, and I think we have the right to be angry cause I came here to work on my issues and, and I'm sorry, Eddie and Kent, but I feel like we're all, we're focusing on John all the time and here, I sit here week after week and I'm trying to make decisions too. 

00:01:55
Jeff 

00:01:55
JEFF I don't, I don't wanna upset people, you know... 

00:02:00
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:02:00
JEFF ...in here. 

00:02:00
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:02:00
JEFF But uhm, I don't know. On the one hand, I guess it has a lot to do with, with me and my education or my lack of education, you know. 

00:02:10
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:02:10
JEFF  Uhm, having left high school, and I think that's kinda of, something business is (inaudible ) to me apart from everybody else in here. 

00:02:21
Katie 

00:02:21
KATIE  A lot of I want for the perfect career choice isn't mine. It's my mother's and yeah, I've been watered way too much, pushed to be the big plant, as being as full and powerful as it can be, you know and, yeah, when I said I want to do the best thing, it wasn't for me. It's because I want to make her proud too.

The Association for Specialist in Group Work Presents The Group Working Stage and Termination Dr. Rex Stockton Indiana University 

00:02:45
REX STOCKTON  Hello and welcome to our final tape on the developmental aspects of group counseling, process, leadership and supervision series. In the first tape of the series, we watched our group as they began, hesitantly and awkwardly. Our second tape showed the group struggle for the transition phase and to the interactive process of the working phase. This is where the members are able to deal with issues of significance in their lives. Let's take a moment and examine the characteristics of this working stage. Here, the members begin to function more as a group, rather than a circle of individuals. They interact more frequently and at greater depth. Plus, there is more self-disclosure and feedback. Members take more responsibility for working on their own shoes and they're less dependent upon the leaders. An increasing group cohesion is noticeable. Thus, the leaders find that they don't need to intervene as much as in earlier stages. So what are the task of leaders during the working stage? The leader's role still continues to be important, although different. The leaders need to encourage an atmosphere where both positive and negative feedback are acceptable and not threatening. A deeper level of member self-disclosure will be facilitated to the continued use of process statements. Leaders can then help them come to terms with the issues they are processing and help translate their insight into action. Now let's return to our developing group. For a number of weeks, our members and leaders have been working on issues of significance for each member. The group is now reaching its time limitation and it's appropriate for the members and leaders to begin the process of reflecting on their experience. It is important to note that the termination process does not just begin the last session. A leader should start the process a couple of weeks earlier by reminding members of the approaching end of the group experience and encouraging them to evaluate where they are in relationship to their goals. As it is often the case, we will see that the process of termination will itself inspire some members to disclose more fully than they have in the past sessions. Now let's watch as the group begins the process of closure. Watch for how Kent and Eddie affirm John's distress and help him receive significant feedback. Also, watch for characteristics of the working group that we have discussed. You'll be able to see how the members and the group are able to interact very therapeutically. This allows John to touch a part of himself that he's been afraid to examine. 

00:05:15
Working Stage: Preparing for Termination 

00:05:15
KENT  Wondering how people feel about the fact that there is only two more weeks left in the, in the group. We've been at this for a long time. 

00:05:35
JOHN  It surprised me. I wasn't, I wasn't aware that there was just two more times. 

00:05:45
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN It's hard to believe. Time has really gone fast. 

00:05:45
Eddie Co-Leader 

00:05:45
EDDIE Then what kind of things might you need to be thinking about, that you want to accomplish in the time remaining in group. Where have you come to, to at this point and what, what is it you'd like to do that you wanna be able to say in two weeks, "I'm glad I did that, that I didn't wait until group was over... 

00:06:05
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:06:05
EDDIE ..."to realize this." What kind of things do you need to do. 

00:06:05
John 

00:06:05
JOHN  Yeah, I, I agree because, uh, like I said I, I wasn't aware that there was two weeks left. Uhm, and because of that ah, it's, it, it got me thinking about a couple things that uhm, I sort of wanted to, to share tonight. 

00:06:25
UNKNOWN Uh huh. 

00:06:25
JOHN Uhm, and I'm glad I, I, I had the opportunity. Now, uhm, last, I guess the last, over the last three weeks, ah, people had been talking more about themselves and sharing things that wasn't going on when we first started, when I was talking a little bit about my problem at work. And, uh, sitting here for the last three, you know, two or three weeks, ah, hearing other people talk, hearing other people give, ah, people advice and support, ah, really has got me thinking about something that, ah, is going on at work that's been real hard for me to talk about. It's hard for me to even admit. Ah, it goes back with, with the fact that, ah, I'm late. I'm uncomfortable at work. Ah, well, I sort of have an idea as to why I might be, why I might be that way at work. Uhm, and, uh, this is just difficult to talk about. When I, uh, when I applied for the job, there were certain qualifications that I had to meet, uhm, that I really just wouldn't gonna meet without maybe exaggerating a point or two on my resume. Well, I did that. Uhm, I've never done something like this before but I went ahead and, and on a couple areas overqualified myself. Uhm, and that has, ah, that has hurt me and made me feel very, very uncomfortable at work. Uhm, I don't like being there at this point. The job that I, that I truly do love, love, I, I, I feel very uncomfortable ah, trying to meet those qualifications still, that I still haven't met. Uhm, I'm really, really scared that ah, I'll be found out. They'll, they'll catch me and if that happens, I, I know I'll be fired and ah, it, it would, it would be a real sore spot in my, in my career. So I, I, I mean now you know a little bit, maybe, about what I, at least I do is, is I couldn't admit this. I couldn't admit that, well, it was just that. And that is so big. It, it, that was such a big realization for me to say well, it's that, it's that resume. It's, it's, it's really exaggerating those, those uhm, those qualifications and, you know, it's like why I couldn't just get there on time and I just couldn't do it because I didn't know what it was making uhm, and what was making me feel so uncomfortable and, uhm, I don't know. I feel pretty bad about, about misrepresenting myself. 

00:09:30
EDDIE Well, it seems that, John, you're saying you feel like you misrepresented yourself to the group as well as to your employer. 

00:09:35
JOHN  Yeah, well, I, that's interesting and I have never really thought about that. 

00:09:45
EDDIE Okay. 

00:09:45
JOHN I mean with Doug I feel like I did, I felt like he knew it. 

00:09:50
EDDIE Like he'd already figured you out? 

00:09:55
JOHN Yeah. I mean, you know, it's important for me to come across like I don't have any problems, you know. I don't want anybody to know that I'm not, you know, right up there. So for me to sit here and say well, you know I'm not only right up, not right up there but I'm sort of willing to go out mis, misrepresent myself at other's expense, at my expense and sure enough, I, I guess I made that as well in this group. I don't know, I hope, I would hope I, I didn't do that. So I don't know what, what I'm gonna do about this, this problem at work. It's hard to go there. It's hard to greet my boss everyday. It's hard to satisfy the requirements that are demanded of me. Uhm. 

00:10:40
EDDIE  Well, let me stop you there for just a minute. I'm kinda wondering what it's been like for you now to disclose this to the group and, and with this idea of maybe misrepresenting yourself to the group. What's this like to talk about this in the group here tonight? 

00:10:55
JOHN Well, I really never thought about the fact that I misrepresent myself. Uhm. 

00:11:00
EDDIE Well, I'm wondering, have others... (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
JOHN I'm not. (crosstalk) 

00:11:05
EDDIE ...are others perceiving it that way? 

00:11:05
JOHN So it's new, what I'm saying is it's new to me to even say this. I, I, I don't know you know. 

00:11:10
EDDIE Do, do you wanna find out. (crosstalk) 

00:11:10
JOHN Yeah, I'd love to. 

00:11:10
[sil.] 

00:11:10
EDDIE  Who do you most want to hear from? 

00:11:20
JOHN Well, I'll go back to my buddy, Doug, here, you know. 

00:11:30
Doug 

00:11:30
DOUG Well, I gue, I guess I understand how, how hard it must be for you to say these things, you know. And on one hand, John, I feel like, you know, yeah, you really did. I mean you misrepresented us or misrepresented yourself to the whole thing here. It wouldn't just work, it was here, you know. But then I wondered how much or how many of us misrepresented ourselves you know, in here. And ah, I don't know. I, I guess I did, to an extent, you know, and, and ah, I, I guess I can talk about that a little more effectively than I can the rest of the group, but I guess I did. And, ah, so I know how difficult that has to be. My concern, honestly, is, is what you're going to do about it... 

00:12:25
JOHN  Yeah. 

00:12:30
DOUG ...you know. I mean you've, you, you've beat yourself up about this for how long now, you know, and ah, 

00:12:40
JOHN Yeah. 

00:12:40
DOUG it's just like us here, you know, you have, oh, here, here I come with another statement. We gotta make a decision, you know. But yeah, we've got to, there comes a point when we gotta do something. And ah, maybe that point for you and talking less here is the same one that, that we've reached to an extent, that yeah, we are a group and we're gonna do something here. I don't know if there's any closure or not. 

00:13:05
REX STOCKTON Doug has shared some thoughts with John. Let's see how a leader intervention helps clarify and give meaning to those thoughts. 

00:13:10
Kent Co-Leader 

00:13:10
KENT One thing that I think I'm hearing you saying, though I'm not sure, is that you, you understand where John's at and, ah, and how difficult it is to disclose the fact that he may have misrepresented himself or has misrepresented himself, and that you understand, I mean that that's a pretty courageous thing to do. 

00:13:30
DOUG  Yeah. Yeah, I know how difficult that would be for John. I think I know how difficult that has been for John. Ah, yeah, yeah. 

00:13:40
KENT And how does that with John. (crosstalk) 

00:13:40
DOUG  Yeah, I know (crosstalk) 

00:13:45
JOHN What, I mean what, what you said, Doug, about, you know, beating myself up at work... (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
DOUG Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:13:50
JOHN ...and still punishing yourself, being your own worst enemy at work, and then maybe doing that in this group and I think that's what I've done, what I've done for so long. Uhm. 

00:14:00
KENT If anybody else can give John some feedback? 

00:14:05
Jeff 

00:14:05
JEFF When you first, uh-huh, when you first said that, excuse me, I guess being an assistant manager, it made me think what if someone, you know, did that at work and then put him on a car and he destroyed it. 

00:14:25
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:14:25
JEFF Something like that, and it, first of all, it rubbed me the wrong way. And not too long after that, I remembered it wasn't too long ago in, ah, trying to get out of my little rut that I told two different possible employers, prospective employers for me, that I had, ah, my high school diploma. So it would be really easy for me to criticize but on the other hand, uhm, I've been in your shoes in, to an extent. 

00:15:00
UNKNOWN Uh-hmm. 

00:15:00
Katie 

00:15:00
KATIE  You know, I'm just glad that you felt safe enough to talk to us about that. Yeah, I think that's the first step... (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
JOHN Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
KATIE ...to dealing with it, is admitting it to us. And I, I mean I don't know what you're gonna do about it but I'm just, I'm real glad for you because I feel like you're going through more with it now. 

00:15:20
JOHN Thanks. Yeah, thanks. 

00:15:20
Margaret 

00:15:20
MARGARET  Well, (coughs) for me, I realized that you really got to take a lot of courage for you to say that because all along in the group, we've always wanted to know what our impressions of you were. So, for you to come out and tell us that you ever since lied about something, that really does say, as Katie said that you must have a lot of trust in us. And then the other thing, I think it makes, it makes, I think I understand better why you didn't do some of the things we suggested, you know, like when we talked about the exercises, or the relaxation tapes because maybe deep down you did know it wasn't just setting the alarm ahead of time that the problem was right there, getting the job, so not following through on our advice. Makes sense now, it really does to me. 

00:16:10
KENT  What I'm hearing from all of you is a real sense of community with John and uhm. 

00:16:20
EDDIE My sense is that they were feeling they were all moving along together, and ah, as we become more genuine and caring and sharing with one another, there's something that I'm sort of seeing happening tonight, as I have over the last couple of weeks. This seems to be another example that you've brought in tonight, John, where people have been able to relate to you, to relate to one another individually, and show some, show some genuine caring. 

00:16:45
JOHN Uh-hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:16:45
EDDIE We seem to be moving along in that direction, as we become more in touch with ourselves as well as with one another. 

00:16:50
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:16:50
REX STOCKTON The therapeutic nature of the working group has allowed John to become more authentic to the group. While this certainly was not a magic cure, he's been supported and affirmed and can now allow himself to look at and deal with this conflict in his life. Well, here we are at the final session. Just as it was important to plan and carry out effective strategies to help the group begin, it is also important for the leaders to thoughtfully plan the process by which they will bring the group to an appropriate end. The leader's main task during termination is to help the members make sense of the experience. Members need to be able to see how far they've come, both individually and as a group. Also, they need to understand and deal with their emotions concerning their experience. They must be allowed to mourn the loss of the group and its safe therapeutic atmosphere. Leaders also need to help the members resolve any unfinished business. It is useful for leaders to provide some type of structure to help them through this letting go process. An exercise that allows the members to give feedback such as appreciations and regrets to one another is often helpful. The process of termination is not easy. Leaders will need to keep the group on track and not allow the members to skip over parts of the process that they would rather bypass. This includes recognition of the reality of termination and actually saying goodbye. One of the most important tasks for the leaders is to help the members build a bridge from the group experience to their future life. Members need to see what they can take from this experience that would be helpful to them in the future. Let's watch as the leaders engage the members in this process. 

00:18:30
Termination Stage 

00:18:30
KENT  Oh, okay. Well, it's, uhm, 16th week and, uhm, our final week. Ah, as we told you last, last, last time we'd be doing terminations today and, uh, it's a really difficult time because we won't be meeting again and so we wanna bring closure to this experience so that, and, and kinda get a sense of what, what the meaning is for us. Ah. 

00:19:05
EDDIE One of the ways we can start, ah, off this evening is to be thinking about what you've been able to get out of the group experience. In that sense, what do you appreciate about the group and the group, what, what have you gotten out of group? A way of thinking about regrets in a group might be a way of, ah, considering what is it that you wish you, you might have done, or what is it that you wish you had seen more of in the group. As a way of thinking now, what, what would you want to be able to do differently, if you had this opportunity again in the future? One of the other things that I think happened during this, this sort of an exercise is it gives you a chance to think about what have you accomplished during this past 16-week period. What additional self-knowledge or skills do you have as a result of, of this experience that you're gonna be able to take with you outside of here. That may be, be able to give you a little more idea now to think about it as we, as we go through individually and express our appreciations and regrets. Does that make sense? 

00:20:05
[sil.] 

00:20:05
JOHN  Um, I cannot. I think I've come, come a long way. I think being in this group has allowed me to ah, realize that I'm, I'm okay, you know, I'm not such a bad person, and it's okay to have problems. Ah, I feel more comfortable about dealing with the issue at work. I don't know what I'm gonna do, you know, do about it but I feel like I can do something. I feel that this group, for the first time, that I've, I've been around people that have listened and understood and has and, and accepted me for, for who I am. And in doing so, I found out that I'm not such a bad person. 

00:21:00
EDDIE I like hearing it from you Johnny. You seem real genuine about that. 

00:21:00
JOHN  Uhm, I appreciate the, believe it or not, Doug. Uhm, I really appreciate your honesty. I sort of regret that I wasn't as honest initially, but, ah, I think everybody gave me time and, ah, I got time. Uhm, so thanks. I am appreciate Jane and Katie, just, ah, for her support. 

00:21:40
KATIE You remind me, you make me think it my biggest regret being that I didn't start working earlier, you know, and I regret personally not listening to you as much as I should've. You know, maybe if I had (laughs) really thought about what you were saying, it would've really gotten me to move faster, and to tie into that, a lot of what you said, Jamie, has made me realize that I can make choices, and I can go out there, and I can do things and it's okay. And I really appreciate both of you being here. 

00:22:15
EDDIE You look totally surprised to see that, Margaret? You do know. (crosstalk) 

00:22:15
MARGARET  Well I, yes, I, I guess so. I guess the other thing's in terms of what Katie is thinking about. Uhm, even if I'm giving you the advice, I know that you're gonna do what you have to do, so I thought you recognized that you can make those decisions. It's really good. I'm glad to hear that. 

00:22:35
JEFF  Well, you, you know, you know I need to look at Doug. I remember you saying one thing that would be really important to you would be to know that you were important to the group, and so this, this isn't just because I know you want that, but it's that ah, I feel like you were a real important part of the group, and you were for me in a way. And, uhm, I think what you've helped me with most, for me is being able to just push through and do something. And you said many times that you don't know what you're doing here, or what to do and ah, the fact that you just kept pushing right through and to be very honest and straightforward about things that, that help me to see that you can do that, you know, that it's alright. And I guess Jamie would be the other person that sticks out most for me, and that is, uhm, probably the similarity between you and my wife. I think that, uhm, that knowing you, and a little bit about you, about your struggle has, has helped me not to just react to my wife just, just like I always have, just to react and not think and not to feel what she's feeling. So I think I can do that a little bit better now. So regret not being able to learn some more from you all. 

00:24:10
REX STOCKTON Jeff has shared appreciations for other group members but he has neglected to acknowledge what he has accomplished. Kent notices this and intervenes appropriately. 

00:24:15
KENT  I'm wondering, Jeff, if you have any appreciation for yourself about the group and what, what you've gotten out of it? 

00:24:25
JEFF Uhm, I think I, I just appreciate myself more. (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:24:30
JEFF Still not quite enough, I think, 'coz I was, and I was like shocked when Margaret said she appreciated me... (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
KENT Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
JEFF ...for something. 

00:24:35
KENT  Uh huh. 

00:24:40
JEFF But, uhm, being in the group, I think, uhm, revealing parts of myself to the group and having that come back okay, you know has been really important to me. 

00:24:50
KENT  Uh huh. 

00:24:55
JEFF As a whole, the group, everyone as a whole allowing me to do that, and, uhm, to feel like it's all right to let people see myself and, and to learn that I wasn't necessarily seeing myself accurately. 

00:25:05
KENT Uh huh. (crosstalk) 

00:25:05
JEFF At least that's the message that I've gotten from some people was that... 

00:25:10
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:25:10
JEFF ...some things about myself was being too critical, about being too hard on me(ph), and I look my shock with, with Margaret. I still need to learn to be more appreciative of myself, I think, (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
KENT Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
JEFF and not be so hard on myself. 

00:25:20
KENT  Well, I, I certainly have a, a lot of appreciations and a, a lot of really strong feelings about this being the last group and ah, I guess ah, I've gotten a lot out of and ah, learned a lot from all of you. Uhm, I think I appreciate the ah, the honesty and the ah, and the risks that all of you had been willing to take. Also, uhm, I want to appreciate my ah, my co-leader who has been a real source of strength for me and, uhm, ah, helped me kind of work with the group and, and, and we worked really, I think, well together and it's been a real positive experience for me. I regret that, I also, that we won't be able to work together more, uhm, at least in the foreseeable future. 

00:26:20
REX STOCKTON In this next segment, watch how Kent and Eddie begin to help Jamie and Doug take the group experience and bridge to the future. 

00:26:25
DOUG  I'd like to ah, you know, I guess we're how many weeks now? 16? I've been saying I don't know what I'm doing here. Maybe I finally know. Ah, down the (inaudible ) maybe I'll finally know. I guess, as far as appreciation the group for myself, it's been, it's been, it's given me an understanding of, of how I relate to people, and I guess maybe a part of that has been through what I've chosen not to relate, and what I've chosen not to show. But I think it's through you guys that, that I've seen how I affect people because of whatever I do, you know, in my demeanor or whatever. And uhm, and that's not always been a positive. That's not always been a positive. But the difference is now that it's important to me. Uhm, you know, I'd like to thank you for that, for being honest, for, for showing me how it is I do come across to people. Uhm, John, I'd like you, I've really, I got one big regret and I wish I hadn't been so hard on you. I really do. Uhm, I just wish I hadn't been so hard on you. I wish I dealt with you more as a person and tried to understand you, and I'm sorry I didn't do that. I'm sorry I didn't do that. Uhm, that I'm really... 

00:28:15
KENT I think, Doug, that's an opportunity you have for the future to be able to stop and, and, and see people as, as humans and. (crosstalk) 

00:28:25
DOUG ...I think there are going to be other jobs. 

00:28:25
KENT Yeah, right. 

00:28:25
DOUG Yeah, I think there are going to be other jobs. Uhm. 

00:28:25
KENT  It's a real neat insight that you have and are able to share with him now. 

00:28:30
DOUG Well, I mean it. I really do. I, I wish that I'd, I'd stopped to look at you and listened to you, and I think that's what I'm talking about, as far as I wish I had ah, because I really do see the growth in you. Ah, and Jamie, ah, sometimes it's hard to find people that will stand up to me and ah, and I appreciate the fact that you did, that you're willing to, to, to say exactly what you thought, whether I liked it or not. And ah, and that's been real important. That's been real important. 

00:29:05
JAMIE That's because I cared about you enough to do that. (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
DOUG  I see that. I see that. Thanks. 

00:29:10
JAMIE  Thank you. It was so good, it was, it was good for me to be able to do that too, to stand up for things that I care about and feelings that I think are important. I mean that's what I was in here to do. And so being able to do that with you was a real challenge but it, it's helped... (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
DOUG I know. (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
JAMIE ...that I'm starting to be able to do this on the outside, Doug. 

00:29:35
DOUG Yeah, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
JAMIE And tell people that are important to me what... 

00:29:35
DOUG  Uh-huh. 

00:29:40
JAMIE ...what I need to say to them. 

00:29:40
DOUG Well, and I think that's how it is going to affect me... 

00:29:40
JAMIE Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
DOUG ...because I, the things that go on here, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
UNKNOWN I see. (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
DOUG I hope they I can carry on. 

00:29:45
EDDIE You're both providing real nice example, I think, of how you've taken the learning's that you, that'd occurred for you and to the individually as a group in here, how you're using these kinds of, of skills for yourself outside the group. It seems like a real nice way of demonstrating how you can transfer what you've learned in here and use it with other people outside of here. 

00:30:05
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:30:05
JAMIE It's strange how that happens. I mean, because at first I don't know how many weeks. I was wondering when I was gonna see something happen outside and it just happened all of a sudden, like in the spring, the trees bloom. I mean all of a sudden, I was starting to do these things on the outside and it, it, it was real surprising and it's just been within the last couple of weeks... 

00:30:25
EDDIE Uh-huh. 

00:30:25
JAMIE ...but it seems more natural and I'm not even aware that I'm doing some of the stuff now. 

00:30:30
DOUG It's almost like in, in this ending that's almost there is a new beginning going on. 

00:30:35
JAMIE Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
DOUG And, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
KENT Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:30:35
DOUG and that's certainly the way I feel... 

00:30:35
UNKNOWN Uh-huh.(crosstalk) 

00:30:35
DOUG  that even though this is coming to a halt here and that there's a lot of things that, that are going to be different. A lot of things are gonna be different, hopefully for all of us. 

00:30:45
REX STOCKTON Now we will see Jamie share some appreciations, but she will need a leader intervention to help her share her regrets. 

00:30:50
JAMIE  I, uhm, I'm sitting here and I'm kind of shaky and it, it reminds me of the first day when I was in the group, except now it's not saying "hello". It's how hard it is to say goodbye. 

00:31:05
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:31:05
JAMIE And I just, I feel like there's all this stuff that I wanna say and that, and, and, and we're all kinda of real quiet and kinda solemn in a way, you know. And, uhm, I'm surprised how hard this is. 

00:31:20
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
JAMIE  Uhm, as far as a, appreciations go, I, everybody's had such a, a different part to play in my experience in here, but real important ones. I mean it's just everybody had this special thing that they did or that I learned from them, and hopefully they learn from me but it, it's hard to think of anyone thing that's specific. Uhm, Jeff, I guess with you I, I feel a real connection because you were talking about feeling so apart from the group but you did, I thought, one of the most courageous things in here, and that's take a big step which it seems like the group after that really got together. And you, you were the one that felt the most distant but you were the one that I thought took the biggest risk at that point. 

00:32:20
JEFF Uh-huh, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:32:20
JAMIE Yeah. And that, ah, I, I'm still impacted by that type of courage. I, I just want you to know that. And, uhm, ah, and Katie and Margaret, I, I just appreciated your guides as input. It just feels good to be able to, even though we're all three at different stages, it's, it's really neat to see. I kinda see part of myself in you, and in me, and then part of myself, and it's just been a neat thing to experience and come to appreciate. I think I appreciate myself more from knowing you two guys. That's important. 

00:33:05
EDDIE Could you talk a little bit about regrets, Jamie? 

00:33:10
[sil.] 

00:33:10
JAMIE  I think it's gonna take a while not to, uhm, not to answer to all the, the old tapes about care taking, you know, and all these "should's" and "ought to's" and, and that kind of thing. And, and all those stuff I've learned in here is good but I think it's gonna, it's still gonna be hard not to pay attention to the old ways I used to be. 

00:33:45
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:33:45
JAMIE  And maybe I, I wish I could've gotten a little further along before I went out in the world and had to face that, my roles again. 

00:34:00
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:34:00
REX STOCKTON  The leaders know the session is almost over. Their task now is to help the group process what has happened in this session and to help them say a final goodbye. 

00:34:15
EDDIE I'm hearing a lot of similarities in the ways of the kinds of regrets that, that all of you have expressed, I think, in, in regrets in not getting to know one another more or not starting some of your work sooner. Uhm, I'm, I'm also getting a sense of that, there's a very strong feeling of being able to take what you've learned and continue this growth outside of here. And Jamie, you also touched on a, on a, a thing that I think is important for us as, as we close down today, too, about what this process is like for each other in here.(crosstalk) 

00:34:45
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:34:45
EDDIE We'd, we'd spend a lot of time individually addressing one another with appreciations and regrets for what's this process been like for you. What's it feel like to you now to be taking, taking this down and moving on? 

00:35:00
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:35:00
KENT Ah, this ability to take, sort of have a, have an experience we can learn from and then apply, apply that learning in, in our future. 

00:35:15
EDDIE That makes sense, sense, Kent because I guess part of what I'm trying to say is this is not the only place we have to say goodbye in our lives. 

00:35:20
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:35:20
EDDIE And what, what can we learn from this process as well and take it, take it outside of here. 

00:35:30
[sil.] 

00:35:30
KENT  I think one of the things that I, that I'm feeling is that Jamie said it very well, and it, it's very hard to say goodbye, and the times in ourselves when we choose not to say goodbye because it's easier. And yet, this is a really good experience to learn that it, even though it's hard, it's very meaningful and very rewarding... (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:35:55
KENT ...to be able to say goodbye and, and close a chapter in our lives and, and learn from that experience, and then move forward and, and open up an, a new chapter in our lives, with the knowledge that that chapter will be coming to a close but they will be better able to deal with that. 

00:36:15
EDDIE Yet I sense this resistance for any of you to talk about it here tonight. 

00:36:20
DOUG Well, it's hard. I mean it seems really hard because... (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:36:20
DOUG  it's like there are so many things that, that we have yet to say to each other, you know? I mean not really one, two, three, four but it's like, (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:36:30
DOUG you know, there's, there's so many things I wanna know about Jeff you know, and, and on and on there is, and, and I want you guys to know all these things about me... (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:36:40
DOUG ...that we haven't, that we haven't done and, so yeah, it's, it's a part of, of, of closing that, assimilate it all, then going on. But for me, there's just a real reluctance to it. It's, ah, it's just hard to go on. 

00:36:55
KENT There's a, it's kinda of like a, ah, I think this has been something that's going on or that's happened before. There's so much to learn... (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
DOUG Hmm. 

00:37:00
KENT ...and yet we've learned so much... (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
DOUG Uh-huh, oh yeah, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
KENT ...and so, ah, it's, it's that you never get it all learned. So I think we certainly can appreciate what we have learned... (crosstalk) 

00:37:15
DOUG Yeah. 

00:37:15
KENT ...and what we carry away from this experience. 

00:37:15
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:37:15
MARGARET I think also is the idea that in terms of saying goodbye, you know, and, and a chapter ending, but it's like we can't really put the chapter away. I mean we may never, (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:37:25
MARGARET  pardon me, we may never meet again in terms of being together like this but I think we'll all, I know personally, I'll carry something from the 16 weeks... (crosstalk) 

00:37:40
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:37:40
MARGARET ...we've had here, except although I may never see any of you again. 

00:37:40
JEFF I have, I have one final appreciation, if I could share that, and that's everyone came here tonight. 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:37:45
JEFF  Because I, I, the thought has crossed my mind and it would be easier not to, (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:37:50
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:37:50
JEFF not to be here so. 

00:37:55
MARGARET Not to say goodbye. 

00:37:55
JEFF Yeah. 

00:37:55
DOUG It was hard being here tonight. 

00:37:55
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:37:55
KENT  And I think that, ah, as, as we have, are winding down now and with the realization that, ah, what is happening tonight is in fact happening, and that although we'd like to continue... (crosstalk) 

00:38:10
MARGARET Uh-huh. 

00:38:10
KENT ...and like to learn, and like to know more, (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:38:15
KENT we have, in fact, come to the end... (crosstalk) 

00:38:15
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:38:15
KENT ...of a really meaningful experience and, ah, I wish you all the luck in, in the future. 

00:38:20
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:38:20
KENT  Hopefully, everything goes well for you. 

00:38:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:38:25
REX STOCKTON As you have seen, the group became a very meaningful experience for the members and it will continue to be a positive impact upon their lives. Our leaders experience also draws to a close. The final supervision session needs to incorporate many of the same elements for the leaders as the termination session did for the members. The leaders need to be able to see the growth that has occurred in their leadership skills. The supervisor needs to help them make sense of this experience so that they might have an expanded view of their ability to use effective intervention strategies in the next group endeavor. Let's watch a short except from Kent and Eddie's last supervision session. 

00:39:05
Termination Stage: Supervision 

00:39:05
REX STOCKTON  Okay. Eddie, you wanna turn it off, please? Thank you. Well, it was a very meaningful experience. Ah, (crosstalk) 

00:39:25
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:39:25
EDDIE Uh-huh. 

00:39:25
REX STOCKTON surely enough, as often happens when groups go very well, people just couldn't quite stop. 

00:39:30
EDDIE Yeah. 

00:39:30
REX STOCKTON How was that for you? 

00:39:35
KENT It was, it was hard. I, I didn't want to stop them. I wanted to keep, keep going but I was ah, aware of the time and, (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
EDDIE Uh-huh. 

00:39:40
KENT and the fact that we really had to... (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
REX STOCKTON Gotta stop... (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
KENT ...stop them. (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
REX STOCKTON ...sometimes. It's never easy. (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
EDDIE It was, it was awkward. I expected them to stop right there where you said that, Kent. (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
KENT Right, yeah. 

00:39:50
EDDIE It was nice hearing what they were saying, but you were right. They just, (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:39:50
EDDIE they didn't. I kept wanting to ask. Uhm, I kept trying to find a good point to, to ask, is there anything else you want to say... (crosstalk) 

00:39:55
UNKNOWN  Uh-huh. 

00:40:00
EDDIE ...before you leave here tonight... (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:40:00
EDDIE ...so that you won't... (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:40:00
EDDIE ...have some regrets and, and they kept trying to do it on their own. 

00:40:05
REX STOCKTON Well, you would've had a full another hour or two... (crosstalk) 

00:40:05
EDDIE Yeah, uh-huh, yeah. 

00:40:05
REX STOCKTON ...because people had a lot to say a lot of, of a lot feelings, a lot of thoughts. (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:40:10
REX STOCKTON Let's go back and look over the session and, and sort of see how you started and what you were thinking about. (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
EDDIE Uh-huh. 

00:40:15
REX STOCKTON There you were terminating, (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:40:20
REX STOCKTON uhm, and you were thinking about appreciations and regrets. What was going through your mind as you had sort of, what, what, what was your strategy as you were getting started? 

00:40:25
KENT Well, it was basically to, to, again, re-introduce the, the whole concept of termination and, and, and what kind of adds some structure to it... (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
REX STOCKTON Uh-huh. 

00:40:35
KENT ...so they knew what was expected to them. We talked about that... (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
EDDIE Uh-huh. 

00:40:40
KENT ...actually the past two weeks. 

00:40:40
EDDIE Uh-huh. 

00:40:40
REX STOCKTON Uh-huh. 

00:40:40
EDDIE I think that's one of the things that surprised me a little bit in the beginning of this group because we had primed them that it's, that we'd be terminating this week and, and talked a little bit about the appreciations and regrets. So I expected people somehow to be a little bit more ready to address one another. There was just a little hesitancy... (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
REX STOCKTON Uh-huh. 

00:40:55
EDDIE ...in the beginning and, and that's when I addressed them. (crosstalk) 

00:41:00
REX STOCKTON That, that lack of spontaneity all over, they could talk about themselves. There wasn't much chiming in early on. 

00:41:05
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
REX STOCKTON That really relates, I think, to people really being deeply into their own feelings... (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:41:10
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:41:10
REX STOCKTON ...about what was going on, paying attention to what the people were saying. 

00:41:10
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:41:10
REX STOCKTON But resonating without, without articulating. 

00:41:15
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:41:15
REX STOCKTON Uhm, well, you had your strategy. You were, I was pleased that you went forward to, to let them know that you wanted a bridge to build, (crosstalk) 

00:41:20
EDDIE Uh-huh. 

00:41:20
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:41:20
REX STOCKTON  that you had to, you had to mourn what had taken place in the sense that the loss was clear. 

00:41:30
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:41:30
REX STOCKTON They've been together, you've all been together now for 16 weeks, shared a lot, a lot of intimacy. At the same time, it's gotta come to an end. 

00:41:35
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:41:35
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:41:35
REX STOCKTON So it's very helpful that you were able to keep coming back and say, come on, let's think about what we, what we haven't done that's important, but what we might be able to do with that, you know, in, in another episode, another, another group experience or another part of just living. 

00:41:50
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:41:50
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:41:50
REX STOCKTON Building those bridges is, is an extremely important part of group work. 

00:41:55
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:41:55
KENT Right. I, I thought that was really needed there, that you were able to make that connection and say, you know, really we can in fact, you, you know, use what we've learned here and be able to move on and, and apply that. And they seemed... (crosstalk) 

00:42:10
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
KENT ...real and, and, and they mentioned it as well. 

00:42:15
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:42:15
KENT I mean, you know, they were, (crosstalk) 

00:42:15
EDDIE They gave some good examples of that... (crosstalk) 

00:42:15
KENT they were, yes right. 

00:42:15
EDDIE ...and that's why I had hoped that, and I wanted to kind of reinforce that, (crosstalk) 

00:42:20
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:42:20
EDDIE that way of thinking for them... (crosstalk) 

00:42:20
KENT Uh hmm. 

00:42:20
EDDIE ...to take beyond here. 

00:42:20
KENT  And you don't always get that... (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
EDDIE Yeah. 

00:42:25
KENT ...ability to have them see that. 

00:42:25
REX STOCKTON Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:42:30
KENT I mean, mean eventually they will. 

00:42:30
REX STOCKTON Right. 

00:42:30
KENT And eventually they will apply what they learn. But to be able to have them do that ah, together as a group... (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:42:35
KENT ...is, is pretty ah, interesting and awfully nice. 

00:42:40
REX STOCKTON Closing a group properly is just as important in starting it, right? 

00:42:45
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:42:45
REX STOCKTON It's, it's equally meaningful starting early gets right. 

00:42:50
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:42:50
REX STOCKTON Gets people beginning the process that's, that they need to profit. Closing gives them the confidence to go forward. (crosstalk) 

00:43:00
EDDIE Uh-huh. 

00:43:00
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:43:00
REX STOCKTON And gives them some meaning for the experience. Any time we, we have an intimate experience, and certainly being together all that period of time, and you have this closing, going through the slow process but going through the stages, and watching people begin to blossom out a little bit. (crosstalk) 

00:43:10
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:43:10
REX STOCKTON Understanding that there's a lot of things that I've been touched by, the group really, really seems to me felt very touched or deeply moved. Well, this was the first time you've worked together. Ah, you, you finished your co-leading now. What sort of experiences do you have for yourselves now that you. (crosstalk) 

00:43:25
EDDIE  That, that's what I was thinking of, as you were saying, being able to close down and take what you've learned here out, out of here, and I feel like, ah, by you and me working together this time, Kent, uhm, I've learned some, some new techniques, new kinds of ways of intervening with group as, (crosstalk) 

00:43:40
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:43:40
EDDIE  as this group presented some... (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:43:45
EDDIE ...somewhat unique challenges for me. 

00:43:45
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:43:45
EDDIE Uhm, and I'd like the way I could learn from you to kinda balance what I was doing, or better ways of saying things. And I hope to be able to use that myself in, in future groups that I would lead. So I feel like I gained something from that aspect, as well as from the individual members. 

00:44:05
REX STOCKTON Uh-huh. 

00:44:05
KENT Yeah, and that's I, I always marvel at, ah, when you say that you learned, ah, from me. And not that I don't believe you, it's just that I would always appreciate your interventions as well, (crosstalk) 

00:44:15
EDDIE Hmm. 

00:44:15
KENT and, and how, and I think, I think it's, you know, that's pretty normal. You get stuck and, (crosstalk) 

00:44:20
EDDIE Uh-huh. 

00:44:20
KENT and I mean your co-leader comes to the rescue. You, that has, that has very special meaning for me, you know. 

00:44:30
EDDIE I felt that too. 

00:44:30
KENT Well, it's been a long journey. 

00:44:30
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:44:30
REX STOCKTON Sixteen weeks isn't a long time but a lot of things happened. 

00:44:35
EDDIE Uh hmm. 

00:44:35
REX STOCKTON Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
KENT That's. (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
REX STOCKTON it wasn't easy for you, that's for sure. 

00:44:35
KENT  That's right. 

00:44:40
REX STOCKTON Ah, it's been a pleasure to me to watch you grow. 

00:44:40
KENT Uh-huh. 

00:44:40
REX STOCKTON  Ah, to respond to the feedback that you have gotten, and to make your own sense on what the group was about. Well, so there it is. The developmental group process is now complete. As a post-script, I thought you might like to see a short segment from the debriefing session that I held with the group members and leaders after the taping project was completed. What I would like you to notice is how the group process affected them beyond their role as members of this project. 

00:45:10
Group Member Debriefing 

00:45:10
REX STOCKTON  Well, here we are at the end, finally and at last, after a long journey together. Uhm, our viewing audience will want to know a little bit about two folks, I think. Ah, they will wanna know that you assumed personas, that you are all graduate students in counseling. I think our viewers would be interested in knowing a little bit about how we got here, and ah, I want to comment that we've been working together for almost a year and we did a lot of practice with other groups of people, "we" being Kent and Eddie and I. And then we had two of those people also, ah, John and Margaret, who were with us earlier last summer so we've, we've gone through many iterations trying to make sense out of this experience. I'd be interested in any, ah, in comments you have about what it was like to take on another persona and to go through this, this, this life-stages of the group. 

00:46:15
JEFF  I'm supposed to look at where? 

00:46:20
REX STOCKTON I think you can look anywhere, anywhere you want to. Now that, now that, now that you don't have to worry about cues and that... (crosstalk) 

00:46:25
JAMIE Go for it, Jeff. 

00:46:25
REX STOCKTON ...sort of thing, I think you can just go. This is a little celebratory exit interview. 

00:46:25
JEFF  Uh-huh. 

00:46:30
MARGARET It's been really interesting, ah, as you had said, John and I were, ah, together. And the other group, and in the other group I was the, was one of the leaders so this was really something different, being a group member as opposed to a leader. And I think the other thing, in terms of character, was trying to respond and wondering, ah, what would Margaret say and what would her character say so that was something, trying to keep the two different. 

00:46:55
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:46:55
JOHN I had a lot of fun, uhm, you know, and I'm really sorry that this has to end, (crosstalk) 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:47:00
JOHN as far as I'm concerned. 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:47:00
JEFF  That was, that was, some of that would be our ending of, of the group, the determination series that we had. Uhm, some of that, it was, actually, there actually was some, some feeling of loss for me... (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:47:15
JEFF ...which was made easier to get into that and being... (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:47:15
JEFF ...with you all this period of time. 

00:47:15
REX STOCKTON We've had a long journey together, (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
JEFF Uh-huh. 

00:47:15
REX STOCKTON  for, for sure. Okay. Other thoughts about the experience that you went through. 

00:47:25
JAMIE I'm relieved it's over. I mean I'm, part of me is really glad that we finally finished this, and that we, you know, accomplished our goals. And then part of me is really sad. So I think the termination stage, when I was looking at you Jeff and Katie and, ah, there was some sadness there that our group isn't gonna, (crosstalk) 

00:47:45
REX STOCKTON Uh-huh. 

00:47:45
JAMIE isn't going to be here anymore. 

00:47:45
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:47:45
JAMIE  So I think that was real, real, being a participant in the group, whether I was an actor or not. Ah, it was real powerful, the stages, and when we were at termination, I was feeling those things, no matter what my role was. 

00:48:00
REX STOCKTON Uh-huh. 

00:48:00
JAMIE So it's, uhm, it was powerful even as a, (crosstalk) 

00:48:00
REX STOCKTON Uh-huh. 

00:48:00
JAMIE  in a simulated group. 

00:48:05
DOUG It's interesting, too, as we start this from the beginning last October whatever, how the stages we've gone through... (crosstalk) 

00:48:10
UNKNOWN Uh-huh. 

00:48:10
DOUG ...as a group and how they paralleled, ah, some of what we did on the... (crosstalk) 

00:48:15
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:48:15
DOUG ...tape there. So I think, I think that's been real interesting. 

00:48:15
JAMIE Yeah, outside of the. (crosstalk) 

00:48:20
DOUG Yeah. 

00:48:20
REX STOCKTON You've had your own... (crosstalk) 

00:48:20
DOUG Yeah. 

00:48:20
REX STOCKTON ...experiences outside. (crosstalk) 

00:48:20
DOUG Yeah. 

00:48:20
REX STOCKTON You met together... (crosstalk) 

00:48:20
DOUG Uh hmm. 

00:48:20
REX STOCKTON ...and you fought through. 

00:48:20
DOUG Uh hmm. 

00:48:20
REX STOCKTON Ah, you had new relationships with each other. It's been an interesting thing to observe that, but not surprising, given what we know about group... (crosstalk) 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:48:30
REX STOCKTON ...work. All of you had the basic course and several of you had advanced courses and group work, and you've all had your other group experiences. But to actually simulate one and go through this from the beginning to end is quite an experience. 

00:48:40
KATIE When I started this, I mean I was just a beginning masters student so I really did not much about groups, as far as I was concerned. And I learned a lot. I learned a lot about these stages of groups, and what you need to know as a leader. And it was real nice. I feel more prepared now, and I'm starting my doctorate in the fall, to work with groups, now that I've been this. 

00:49:00
JOHN I co-led a group, also Mr. Wong(ph) in the advance group class, and it's been real interesting with this sort of happening at the same time. You know, you go sit in the other chair, you know. At the same time, you're also included here. It's been real good for me and I'd like to, to be able to do that. Uhm, and another thing, it's real interesting that no, no matter how different, you know, how different our personas are, I mean there are little bits of us that come out that are real, very real. I felt that there were many times where I said something and then I'd go, "Wait a minute, was that really me?" or, you know, "What's going on?" 

00:49:40
KENT And sometimes I, I wasn't sure I was in my persona but, ah, uhm, especially when the group members were so good about not agreeing with me when I was saying one thing. Are you sure this isn't what's going on? They said, "No, that's not going on." So ah, anyway, it was an interesting experience and I think, ah, it was hard to sort of keep the persona and the individuals, ah, separate and, and kind of getting your mind set about where you guys where at the different stages. And so, ah, but I think we did a really good job of moving into the working station, that in the working stage set for it, there was really that kind of sense of, (crosstalk) 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN Hmm, uh hmm. 

00:50:15
KENT ah, getting at a deeper level, and, and, and as a leader promoting that and, and (inaudible ) pleased with that, with that experience. 

00:50:25
JEFF I have to disagree with you Kent. (laughing) I mean I don't have any problem at all keeping the roles separately. I was just wondering, John, what are you going to do about getting to work on time? 

00:50:35
MARGARET  Tell the truth (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:50:41
JOHN Yeah, the truth to that, you know, is that it doesn't come out. 

00:50:41
REX STOCKTON Let me ask you if you have any regrets. (crosstalk) 

00:50:45
JOHN (inaudible ). 

00:50:46
REX STOCKTON Where would you like to go from here with the (inaudible )? I know you're all interested in group work. Or clearly, I think maybe even more sharply, ah, ah, give you a sharper perspective on that. 

00:50:55
EDDIE As this progressed, it seemed like where I started out feelings like I was playing a role, as the group progressed through stages, it became more and more work, but it really felt like a genuine working stage, ah, kinds of things going on and, and I felt very drained at the end of some of our sessions, just as I would if, if I hadn't been doing some persona work or individual men's(ph) work. 

00:51:20
REX STOCKTON Well, for me, it's been a an extremely productive experience watching you work and working with you behind the scenes. Uhm, I want to thank you all for, for being part of this and, and I wanna tell our viewers that you have worked very hard indeed, many, many hours beyond what you see in tape. Uhm, we, I also wanna really get my appreciations to my colleagues in Indiana University who've been so forthcoming and helping us do this, ah, putting on a production like this when you have this vast studio and all the cameras and the lights and all the people who were so effective in helping us put it on, it's been a marvelous experience for me, (crosstalk) 

00:52:00
KENT Certainly. 

00:52:00
REX STOCKTON so thank you all very much. 

00:52:00
UNKNOWN Uh-hum. 

00:52:00
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:52:00
UNKNOWN All right. 

00:52:00
REX STOCKTON  In this videotape series, you have seen the therapeutic nature of the developmental group process as it affects members. Also, you've seen the leaders grow and mature as the group progressed and you've gotten a sense of the role of supervision in their training. After viewing this tape series, I hope that you feel more confident in your leadership ability and I wish you good luck in your group leadership experiences.
