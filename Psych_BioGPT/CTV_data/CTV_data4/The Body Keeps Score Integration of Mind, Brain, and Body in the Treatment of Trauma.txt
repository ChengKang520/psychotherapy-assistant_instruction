BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Ah, thank you for coming. How many of you were here also yesterday at my talk? A lot of you. There's gotta be a little bit of overlap between yesterday and today, I hope you put up with it. There'll be-- one video will be the same, ah, I'll try to-- cuz some of it, they talk about, they talk about the very basic yesterday. So, okay, ah, let me start off with the earliest movie of traumatized people I've been able to get a hold of. Uhm, it's a movie that was taken about-- a series of movies that was taken about a hundred years ago, uhm, in the middle of the First World War, ah, at the time that people decided to go crazy and do terrible things to each other. And this-- the, the early movies bring something home about what trauma looks like. So, here it is. So, in each one of these pictures you'll see somebody whose body, whose organism is repeating an old thing, ah, their bodies are stuck back there, uhm, and triggered by the gre-- the right thing. They start acting as if they're back there. This is not an issue about cognition, an issue about the minds, and that the mind actually shuts down and the body ultimately starts reliving it again as a-- the earliest descriptions of trauma were about the automatic responses that, ah, are totally devour from people's will, like people automatically react to old and irrelevant information.

BESSEL VAN DER KOLK As I was working on my book, it's not finished and it will be here next year, uhm, I also been into interesting things and that's the issue of how society at large has a very hard time remembering the consequences of trauma or face the consequences of trauma, ah, that, ah, one of the most distressing things for me personally was that I had spent 30 years studying traumatic stress, do a lot of research, ah, writing a lot of books and then the US decided to invade Iraq. And nobody talked about what that would do to us and, you know, there were no surprises. I'm actually very upset every time the newspaper comes up for something new like, "Oh my God! These guys are s-- committing suicide in high rates," or "Oh my God! The, the gu-- these guys are taking drugs," or "These guys become violent to their families." Ah, for somebody who'd know some of the trauma, I'd go like, "Duh! You know, this is totally and completely predictable if you sent people into a war zone, ah, every war is very well been documented, this is what happens to people, ah, and it shouldn't be a surprise." Before we evade other countries, we should actually weigh, ah, the price that people will pay by doing a thing like that instead of afterwards decided that-- no, no, no, it's just like, you know, we know stuff, ah, I mean, we know the stuff as a defense, we should actually take it into account but there's this denial everywhere. And so, you know, most people-- this-- some of you probably have heard of shell-shock. Ah, shell-shock was the old word for PTSD in the First World War and then like, uhm, there's something I'd never read before, ah, recently and that's, ah, in 1917, so it's towards the end of the First World War, the British high commands puts out an edict and says, "Nobody is allowed to diagnosis soldiers but shell-shock." We had not a lot of published articles about it, nobody will get any medical care for it, it doesn't exists. And so, there's always this issue about that trauma is there, all of us know it, but we really don't want to know about it. Unless we just sort of hide it away and let people, ah, right after the war people are not to talk about it, but two years from now, people said, "Just get over it. I'll continue with it." That happens all the time where trauma is. People don't want to know about this, and we go on. And so the issue is that nobody wants to know about trauma. Patients what-- don't know about, know about trauma because-- what they saw in this movie because it's too horrible to remember and society doesn't want to know about it either because it has too many consequences. And so let me show you the movie again that some of you saw yesterday which, ah, the Hallmark movie, uhm, about what it's like to be a traumatized person today. And so this is what happens when you try to do psychotherapy with traumatized people. And what do you see is their breathing becomes irregular, their voice becomes uptight, their bodies become frozen, and as psychotherapist, many psychotherapist ignore what really it might be in front of their face namely a person whose body is falling apart but that's what the trauma is. The trauma is not about what's happening in terms of what people are saying but their bodies are reliving it, ah. So, to make sort the core parts here is that trauma starts, oh dear, as a story and I hear a lot of people here talking about storytelling, etcetera, etcetera, it's very nice. But the story about a trauma is a story that people tell. The difficulty with being traumatized is you cannot tell the story or you cannot tell the story about what really is bothering you because that's why you're traumatized, because the parts of your brain that are supposed to tell the story shut down. And you so you can't tell stories about other things that are just a little bit different from the core issue but the core issue is the issue of speechless terror that people relive stuff in there body as if something that starts out as an event out there, starts as being event out there because time goes on and now lives inside of people, that is the trauma lives inside and it lives as very nasty sensations in your body - pain, constriction, anxiety, pain, not feeling your body, ah, feeling deeply upset, you're breathing changes so the trauma comes to live inside. And all good trauma work is done, ah, inside of a person. It's done right now because the trauma really is over. You know, past, it happened a long time ago. Ah, but the trauma is recreated, is-- comes back all the time inside of people's bodies and in order to overcome the trauma, you need to help people to learn, to feel, to tolerate, to manage and to overcome the trauma that's large inside. Uhm, and so Steve shows me this tape and I'm quite irritated with him because I've seen so many tapes and I see this in my office all the time and I deal with the same issue namely that my traumatized people, uhm, when they're start talking about the trauma and they come too close to it they become too upset, they start freaking out. And so, as a psychotherapist, what I've started to do is probably something that many of you also do, is just sort of shy away from the core issue because as a psychotherapist, you don't want your patients to become freaked out, upset, uhm, won't be able to drive home, go to a panic so we solve security issue as security issue makes us into safe people and people who do you f-- may like but it doesn't really gives off the trauma. Another question is how do you help people to go there without getting freaked out? Now, a very, uhm, highly advertised technique for that is prolong the exposure, ah, that is that you just blast people with the memory of the trauma until you no longer feel the pain. And this is a, ah, technique that's developed originally from people who have spider phobias and stuff like that and people thought that being traumatized is just like having a spider phobia and so you just keep exposing yourself to it, you will no longer be afraid of spiders. That's really a fundamental misunderstanding of what the trauma is all about and as I was writing my book this past year, I was writing this, this-- chapter on that issue, uhm, I went out for a little walk and what I see outside is-- right in front of my door there's a big beardy guy and a little boy on a tricycle. He's about 5 years old and this guy is screaming at this kid and brutalizing this kid and I'm a little freaked out seeing this guy do to him and then I want to punch him in the face. Uhm, the kid totally doesn't react to his father, the kid has had flood exposure treatment. He's been exposed to his father's brutalization all the time and now he ignores his father. How good do you think is that for this little kid to not longer be afraid of this terrible father? He clearly do that at a grace-- great price. Ah, my idea is that trauma treatment is not about prolong the exposure, it's about helping people to integrate a trauma. We'll get to talk a little about that. And so, how do you do that? I didn't know how to do that but I actually come across it unwittingly because early in my career I've done sleep studies of traumatized people and my colleagues and I had discovered something that we didn't know what it meant namely that, that you put traumatized people at the laboratory, and they wake up out of their dream sleep, they don't dream. And the moment they get into dreams that incorporate their trauma, they wake themselves up and we published that and didn't know what to make of it. But today we know a lot about it and what we know today is that the brain has its own natural healing mechanisms and that the function of dream-- dreams is invented-- discovered by a friend of mine at Harvard call Robert Stickgold. The function of dreams is to help us to integrate our daytime residues into our overall internal mental structures. And that our brains have our natural ways of healing from all the misery and upsetness that we have from day to day. Ah, I'm sure everybody in this room even if it you live in Southern California have had the experience, we have it at Boston a lot, you go to bed at night, you say, "Shit man! I'm not going to continue to live in the middle of the snow storm. I'm out of here," and you're really upset and the next morning you wake up and you go, "Hey! It's a little snow, it doesn't matter." And so something happens at night that helps us to sort of integrate and tolerate stuff. That is-- the function of dream sleep is to move these things around your mind. Uhm, when you get traumatized, you cannot do that and so when people talk about resilience, ah, they talk about all these external factors but maybe the most important factor is whether your brain is able to dream and maybe dreaming is sort of the, the way that we all naturally take care of business but if we can't dream, we can't integrate it. And that issue makes me somewhat open to listening to my friend Steve who has just discovered this weird technique called EMDR where you wriggle your fingers in front of people's eyes and, you know, I'm a professor at Harvard at this time and professors at Harvard don't wriggle their fingers in front of people's faces and so I go like, "Get away from me like, ah, stupid." Ah, and so he chose me to stay and so here's the same person. Uhm, two weeks later at the beginning of her third treatment session, I go, "Wow! I think your laughter is appropriate." I go like, "Wow! What happens?" Ah, you don't need to be, ah, be a student of Peter Levine and, ah, biotherapist to see that something very dramatically has happened and this person sort of automatically assumed this Buddha posture of repose and cognizant happiness. Uhm, I said, "Wow! This guy did something, huh." He only did actually with the EMDR is he asked her to remember what she saw, what she felt, what she heard, and what she was thinking at the time of the trauma but he didn't ask her to tell him the story. Ah, one of the great things about EMDR is that it's not a verbal therapy. It's a person visiting stuff inside which is so great because as we just saw, the moment that a person starts talking about her trauma, they start freaking out. Ah, so, i-- in my, in my book I call this the miracle and the tyranny over language, i.e., you cannot really communicate with people without talking about stuff but in terms of trauma you cannot talk about it because she gets so freaked out when she starts talking. And so it's just very complex issues and EMDR bypasses that and you asked people to move their eyes from side to side as they are calling out the stuff and then what happens, it sets up a-- an associative process, very much like what we all experience when we sleep late on Sunday mornings. So you have just like lie in bed and you have all the stuff going through your heads or dream like things and then you wake up and it disappeared. Ah, it's called the hympnopompic state-- hypnopompic state and that's what you goes through with EMDR. Ah, and then after what you see, hmm, it's gone. It doesn't bother me anymore. And so it's a fascinating process akin to hypnosis where your brain sort of starts knitting things together, uhm, fascinating. And so here's what she does after two sessions of EMDR, ah, totally different, ah, and the reason why I love showing this movie is it really shows the difference between being at traumatic states and having a traumatic memory, ah, traumatic memory is a-- an active memory. Your body relives it. Now, she's telling a story. Ah, the trauma is complete, it's over, and the difference between being a traumatized person and non-traumatized person is at the end of treatment, people are able to tell their story. Ah, so at the VA and other place right now, people wants to hear your trauma story before the beginning of treatment. You can't tell people the story because as I'll show more to you did the brain really no longer has access to speech and language, uhm, that sort of stuff but if you do the treatment right, at the end people can tell the story but the story of something that happened a long time ago. And so we do brain images of traumatized people before and after they do the EMDR and what we see is that this weird eye movements change something in this part of the brain that I'll talk about quite a bit, the part of your brain that's called the anterior cingulate and the basal ganglia, the part of your brain that helps you to distinguish between past and present, between feelings and cognition and helps you to distinguish between what is relevant and what's irrelevant. And so it's not-- it just happens and you cannot tell somebody, "Just activate your anterior cingulate, just be able to distinguish between past and, ah, future" that just happens and it's important for us to discover what are the best way of helping to activate these part of the brain that get enough to have our trauma. But talking is not one of them. Uhm, talking has many, many virtues but not that and so when you see something like that, ah, yeah, that's great. And you see something like that and you think, "Okay, if you can do it already, then learn how to do it." But if you can't this is really responsible to continue that you traumatize people if this is not something that you have in your vocabulary, huh. And so, after seeing somebody like that, you need to make a choice whether it's okay to continue to charge your patients or the insurance companies or to learn something. And in my case, I'm always looking for stuff that's intriguing like this different and I've done a whole bunch of research my entire life on weird stuff, you know, I'll talk about some other things in a while. Uhm, and I think I need to find out what this is all about and I start doing research on the EMDR and learn how to do it, I'm using all my practice all the time and, ah, one of the thoughts I have about this tape is, "Wow! This is interesting," and then I take my old EMDR training and I'm hooked up with a guy in my demonstration piece who takes an instant dislike to me and when I asked him, ah, "So, what do you want to work on?" He says, "Oh, some stuff that happened with my dad when I was 5 years old." I said, "Ah, like what?" He says, "I, I, I, I don't trust you, I don't like, I'm not gonna tell you about it." I go, "Okay," uhm, so how do you do therapy with somebody who won't talk to you? Ah, and if he'd come to my office at that time I put boots in the mouth but here I'm sitting in front of five other students, I need to behave myself and, uhm, be nice. And I go like-- I go, "Okay, uhm, so can you remember it very well?" He says, "Yeah, I can." "Uhm, how upset are you thinking about it on a scale of zero to 10?" "About eight." I said, "Okay, so are you sure you don't want to tell me?" He sa-- he says, "No." I said, "Okay," so he's doing EMDR and he starts weeping and crying and move his body, ah, clearly very distressed, he stopped after a while and I said, "So, what happened? Do you get now?" He says, "Oh, some other crap," and I say, "Like what?" He says, "None of your business, okay." I go, "Ah, okay." And so it goes off for about half an hour, after half an hour he finished, he looks much better after half an hour. So, I say, "So, how was that?" and he says, "Well, you know, I would never said anybody to you as a patient," I said, "Okay, why not?" He says, "The way that you move your hand at the end is like really unpleasant," so today if you ever want to have a great EMDR session with elegance, movements, I'm the guy to see. So, I say, "So, how was it otherwise?" He said, "Oh, I resolved the issue with my dad," and I turn to his EMDR trainer and I said, "Men, this is just a bunch of crap. Like that guy doesn't want to talk to me, he hates me, he says he's secured but continues to hate my guts and it's clearly something of transferential reaction to his dad. Uhm, this thing is no good and then Jerry Park(ph) says to me, "You know, Bessel, did you have a chance go into the mental health profession because you wanted to solve some issues of your own?" And I said, "Yeah. People have speculated about this," uhm, and then he says, "Uhm, do you like it if people tell you trauma stories?" And I say, "Ah, actually, I have to admit it, I actually do." He says, "You know, if you like to have-- there's nothing wrong with wanting to hear trauma stories. I would advise that you go to a bar room and take some dollars out of your pocket, put it in the bar stool and say, 'Hey, I'll buy you a drink. Just tell me your trauma story.'" But as a therapist, a patient's trauma story is their business and I would urge you to put your voyeuristic tendencies and holes and to really think about whether you'll ask people to tell you the stories for your sake or for theirs. And I go like, "Wow! That is helpful." And ever since that time I've actually taken on that advice to really think about why we want to know what our patients tell us and that maybe some of it is none of our business but because the issue of overcoming trauma is not telling, "You, what's going on with you?" but about allowing yourself to know what you know and I could talk about it for a very long time. Let me give you an example, uhm, I have, I have a friend by the of Jamie Pennebaker, uhm, who has done research on writing, uhm, for his entire academic career, a very prominent psychologist and he shows that if people can write about the details of their most unhappy experiences and worried about, uhm, the impact that it has set on their li-- on their lives and worried about in great detail day after day. They, uhm, get along better with other people, they get higher grades, their immune system improves, their stress hormone system goes down and so what Penni-- Pennebaker showed is that, uhm, being able to allow yourself to know things very deeply and also allowing yourself to emotions has profound and curative effect. Now, I love that work and at some point I go to NIHM and do a yoga study which I, I'll talk about in b-- in a little while. And I thought it'll be really interesting to compare yoga which has no verbal aspects to it whatsoever with a totally focused trauma, ah, verbal type of thing and what I find out is that, ah, that the outcome for writing for PTSD isn't so good. So, I seek Jamie somewhere and I say, "Hey! What's up with that no data for PTSD?" He says, "You know what it is? Because therapists always want to get into the action and they put people into groups and they ask people to tell each other their stories but that's not what my work is about. My work is about helping people to know what they know and to feel what they feel." And when he does his research he finds out that telling things to yourself is much more powerful than telling things to other people. This is actually a very relevant issue for all of us, that's a very relevant issue when it happened to my own psychoanalysis, uhm, very old fashioned, let's do that. And what I noticed in my own psychoanalysis is that when I got into very deep personal stuff I had a choice between continuing to tell stories to therapist or to feel what I'm feeling and that I discovered I could not do both at the same time. Anybody does also ever had that experience, huh? Some of you or all of you. Well, neuroscience research shows that if you very deeply experience something deeply inside of yourself, if you allow yourself to feel your feelings very deeply, you light up one particular circuit of the brain. If you start telling at people about what you feel, you light up an entirely circuit of the brain and it these two circuits have only a very tenuous connection and so that's something for us as a psychotherapist to really think about whether asking people to tell us about their internal world, gets in the way or help psychotherapy. I could talk about it for several hours which is a very complex issue. And so as long as they're in the talking mode, I'll have some more neuroscience data on that, you sort of stay away from yourself and it's very hard to change yourself while talking to somebody else. The only way you can really change yourself is you go deep-- if you go deeply inside of yourself. I'll, I'll, I'll show you that's indeed the case.

BESSEL VAN DER KOLK So, uhm, because of Steve's, ah, initial thing and because of other things, we eventually go to NIMH, we do the first and up to now only NIMH funded, ah, research study on EMDR and it turns out to it has the best outcomes of any treatment outcome study done today. Ah, ha-- what we see is our adult onset people, people who have had one time trauma, car accidents, rapes, torture, ah, and otherwise be able to study healthy adults that at the end they have about an 80% cure rate. So, now, if somebody comes to my office, ah, after a car accident after an assault or after a rape, I can say to my patient with a great deal of confidence, "Now, even though you horrible right now, in about four or five-- six sessions you'll be okay and you'll be fine." And people often times look so terrible that I cannot believe what I'm saying myself because I cannot believe that it's possible that people start so badly and a few weeks later they're a bit well but it works and it actually does that. Uhm, so, we do the study and that's what we find, ah, but what we also find is that people with prolonged childhood trauma, people who were abused or incestuous kids have not nearly as good response. And this is a very big issue in the field of traumatic stress and that almost all of the research assumes that one form of trauma is like any other form of trauma and that is a profound and tragic fallacy. Growing in an environment in which you don't feel safe, in which you feel threatened by the people who are supposed to ca-- take care of you has a profound and pervasive effect on every aspect of your functioning, on your neurobiology, on your brain function, on your cognitive function, etcetera, etcetera, and that is really the great problematic issue that, ah, this board-- we have some thoughts about it but certainly no, no way that the degree of certainty as we have about long-time trauma. 

00:26:10
Acute trauma 

00:26:10
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uhm, so I ain't going to talk a little bit more about what I talked about yesterday that I'll move into other things. So, uhm, to my mind is the paradigm of an acute trauma is what happened in New York in September 11th because we all can relate to this and, ah, we are all, in a way, affected by it even though, ah, the, the word, ah, trauma has become so inflated that people in San Diego said they were traumatized by 9/11, no they were not. They had a bad experience. Ah, it's very important to not go everything in trauma. A trauma is something that permanently and profoundly changes your neurobiological, ah, functioning, the functioning of yourself, etcetera, etcetera. So, here are the people were in danger, these are the people who were at the World Trade Center when this attack happened and what we see here, and I've said this before, yesterday, is when you ask psychotherapist who are, ah, taught to pay attention to emotions and nothing else, if you ask psychotherapist what do you see here most of them say, "I see scared people," or "I see panicked people." And actually, that's not what you see, you see running people, okay, and the issue for me is that we sort of keep going by our meta-ideas rather than looking at the facts and the fact is these people are running. And what we also know is that when you get traumatized and you can run and you can move and you can do something, you don't get traumatized. Because what is-- what happens when you get expose to great danger, ah, your stress hormones start bumping and people think about stress hormones as bad and evil things. Stress hormones are fantastically important. It's very important for me today because it's as huge snowstorm right now Boston and that we'll be prevented from flying back tonight as I'd hope to do. So, what I'm gonna come back to is I'll come in Boston, I'll say, "Oh, it's really pretty," and the next thing I'll think, "Shit! My car is under 6 feet of snow," and my stress hormones will start bumping and I'll become u-- upset but what my stress hormones will allow me to do is to get my shovel out and go "Tsk, tsk!" Ah, so that's the stress hormones are for. We are the sort of resiliency-- resilient, fantastic species we are because we have stress hormones and we can rise to the occasion. What messes up your stress hormones is if you're hell done and prevent it from doing something at the time that this happens. And then your stress hormones keep churning through your body but they ha-- don't have an outcome and they don't have released by taking action. Ah, again, something very interesting for psychotherapist because we don't take action, yeah, we just sit on our butts and we talk. Ah, but overcoming trauma may in for having to evolve ac-- actually getting off your body and so that's the thing that we need to examine and take seriously. Uhm, so that's what you see and then there's all this panels of stuff and I spent a lot of time in New York afterwards and then a colleague of mine shows me this picture and this is an interesting picture. Maybe so-- how many people know what is this? Recognize this? What, what are they looking at? Brooklyn Bridge. Want to buy one? Okay, this is the Brooklyn Bridge, huh, uhm, and what you see here is all these people running across the Brooklyn Bridge and I think that's interesting. The same people running down the street are now running over the Brooklyn Bridge but I bet there is nobody from New Jersey running on this bridge, ah, New Jersey is the other side. And what I realized is that au-- automatic response of creatures is to move in response to a trauma and to move towards in a particular direction and that direction is called home. And if you're really upset, you're able to make it home where you have somebody who says, "Oh my God! Let me take care of you, let me give you a bath, let me feed you, let me keep you warm, you don't have to do anything until you feel better." People almost never get traumatic stress. Ah, the issue is that this traumatic stress is you cannot go to a place where people help you to reset your biological emergency system and then you get stuck and to replaying it over and over again. And so home or whatever we construct as home is a critical dimension that depen-- that, that determines whether people get traumatic stress or not. And so, uhm, at that time I have a bizarre flashback, it's about 25 odd years after I graduate from medic-- medical school, I have a flashback of the last page of my anatomy exam, ah, book-- textbook and I said, "Oh, there it is." Ah, the, the textbook that shows what happens when a person is in great danger and what you see is that the whole body starts-- engage to move, to fight, to run, and to do something to disappear. We have all been there. I bet everybody in this room has at some point been in danger and has-- either slam on the brake or run away or do something and that's a normal response that is not only a response from you conscious your, it's a response from your animal brain because your conscious is too slow to make the determination. Okay, if something-- so, a huge explosion occurs right now, ah, most of us will just start running out of this room without much thinking, ah, because if we had to think, "Oh, what's going on here?" ah, we'll be dead. And so, your, your frontal lobe shuts down, it's very important. Ah, at the moment you get very stressed, your frontal lobe shuts down and I mentioned this yesterday already and there's that all of us get there from time to time and some of us-- all of us get there --on their sometimes minor circumstances, ah, so most people in the-- in our-- in this room has probably said horrible, cruel, nasty, mean, and irresponsible things to people they love. And, uhm, after which you're sort of horrified by doing that and you say to your honey, "Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I said it," and your honey will probably say to you, "I know, I know you're upset," or ba-ba-pa-pa-pa, ah, ah, but it --but how they should say, yeah, I know that your frontal lobe doesn't mean any of that but your limbic system, ah, it's a pretty nasty limbic system and it's filled with nasty stuff, man, and you better do some limbic system therapy because the next time I leave my socks on the floor or whatever, you may blow up with me again. And, uhm, and then you look in the newspaper for, ah, limbic system therapist and you don't find them but trauma therapy is limbic system therapy and-- because it sits in that very primitive part of your brain that has been kindled by the trauma and that smallest thing can set you off to shut down your frontal lobe and to take leave of your senses. Ah, what, what do traumatized people do? They don't really want to blow up with people, they don't really want to scream at people, they don't really want to shut down, ah, ah, it's not because they decide that, it's not like, "Oh, let's do a little cognitive reframing and you'll be okay," Ah, no. It's because your animal brain, your limbic system is set to perceive the world is a terrifying dangerous place and so did-- our job is to help to deep-- dig deep down into the animal brain and to change core perception systems which cannot be done by insight and understanding. You don't get there, there's no pathways from our rational brain to our emotional brain contrary to what all these problem that therapists tell us. So, that's the part of the brain we're all the stuff happens. Uhm, and how do you settle it done. Ah, we have natural ways of calming people down and we saw this in New York after 9/11, this outpouring of generosity, warmth, hugging, gentleness, all this great stuff and there was almost no PTSD after 9/11 in New York because nobody said it was your fault and nobody said you're a horrible person because you're poor or because you're Black or anything like that. People, ah, something like two-- two-thirds of America donated money to help the people in the-- in New York crisis, outpouring of generosity. So, that's it. Ah, very sharp contrast to what happened in Hurricane Katrina. Every people were blamed and people were despised and people were left without resources and people are locked up in the, in the stadium down there and we're not allowed to be, ah, be part of their recovery. And what you see here is 10 guys who have-- are on stretchers in a military transport plane being shipped out of New Orleans. So, these are guys who are filled with stress hormones, stre-- stress hormones that are supposed to be there to have them shipped or go off to home depot, get some hammer and get some nails, get some tube for it to repair their roofs. And instead of being able to use that energy, they're being strapped down on the stretcher and being shipped off to be completely helpless in some (inaudible ) failure or somewhere out of state. Ah, if you want to create traumatic stress, this is the way to do it, ah. Ah, people have done the research and indeed, the, ah, New Orleans had a rate of PTSD of 33% two years after Hurricane Katrina because of this. Ah, so what we do has a great deal eff-- of effect on how post-traumatic people, people become and it depends on the degree to which we help people to feel physically safe and allow people to get back and to take in charge of their lives, okay. And so if you want to really mess people up and help them make them feel helpless, don't give them the loans for housing, don't give them the credits, don't send them to good schools, make sure that they stay unemployed because they don't have the skills, and then don't be surprised if these people become very angry people who come back to kick our asses, ah. It's interesting that I go regularly to Northern Europe, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, and about one of the four times that I go there I get a call from the local ministry of health who says, "Oh, I-- we know that you know something about traumatic stress. Would you like to spend an afternoon at the ministry to tell us about the latest research," and I do that. It's very interesting because people are interested to it and why do they do that? So, they can adjust their policies to the science that has been discovered about what happens in traumatic stress. As a result, in a country like Norway where people always actually following science, the rate of incarceration is 51 per hundred thousand, in Texas it's over 100,000. Ah, it's over a thousand per, per hundred thousand. Ah, so, yeah, these things actually make a difference in our lives and, ah, these things can actually make life safer and, ah, for everybody.

Charles Darwin 1809 - 1882 ""Man and animals...all have the same senses, intuition, sensation, passions, affections and emotions.: Behaviors to avoid or escape from danger have clearly evolved to render each organism competitive in terms of survival. But inappropriately prolonged escape or avoidance behavior would put the animal at a disadvantage in that successful species preservation demands reproduction which, in turn, depends upon feeding, shelter and mating activities all of which are reciprocals of avoidance and escape. 

00:37:45
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK So, let me step back to a really-- for you guys probably very non-obvious things. I have this love for dead right guys and my olest-- my oldest dead right guy is Charles Darwin who all of you have heard about. And at the end of his life, Charles Darwin wrote a book called the Emotional Expressions of Animal and Man because Darwin first started over beaks and claws and fins and that sort of stuff but like everybody else, ah, but it's really interesting what life is but the real creatures human beings are and with all their emotions and their worries and stuff. And so, he gets interested in emotions and he wonders if emotions is something that we have towards evo-- evolution and he, uhm, uses the latest technology of his day to measure things because boys always love the latest technology and the latest technology determines what we can see. And so the latest technology in the 1870s is photography and he collected photographs from all around the world of people, animals, tribe, people, actors, kids, ah, and this-- puts them on his kitchen table and ranks emotions. Ah, you see of them here, ah, when you buy this book, 40.95 on Amazon, ah, I'm so impressed-- fantastic book, actually, ah, you can see all these pictures of animals and human beings having emotions. And then Darwin writes that men and animals all have the same, ah, senses, intuition, sensations, passions, affections, and emotions. I think that's interesting, ah, because if this is hardwired, if, if emotions are part of our evolutionary heritage it is there, uhm, for-- to stay. All right, people have emotions whether you like it or not. It's not a function of your upbringing or the culture you live in. We have emotions just like our dogs have emotions and so, uhm, a lot of psychologists say, "Oh, you shouldn't feel that way," or "You shouldn't be angry," or something. Uhm, after reading Darwin, I made a rule in my office that if I ever say to a patient, "You shouldn't feel this way or let's reframe your emotions," that I will charge for that session cuz it's just like a stupid, I think, to say. People have the feelings they have. You know, that, that those feelings are there, they are hardwired and our question is how can we help people cope with their feelings. And then Darwin, the brilliant man that he is, talks about traumatic stress. 

00:40:20
Charles Darwin 1809 - 1882 ""Man and animals...all have the same senses, intuition, sensation, passions, affections and emotions.: Behaviors to avoid or escape from danger have clearly evolved to render each organism competitive in terms of survival. But inappropriately prolonged escape or avoidance behavior would put the animal at a disadvantage in that successful species preservation demands reproduction which, in turn, depends upon feeding, shelter and mating activities all of which are reciprocals of avoidance and escape. 

00:40:25
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK He says, "Behaviors to avoid or escape from danger have clearly evolved to render each organism competitive in terms of survival." And so, uhm, ah, ah, fight-flight is good for people. You won't survive without it. But he-- then he talks about traumatic stress because this is what traumatic stress is all about. He says, "Inappropriately prolonged escape or avoidance behaviors," which we can do in traumatic stress, "will put the animals at a disadvantage in that successful pe-- species preservation demands reproduction." So, he, Darwin, solidly lines himself up with the Catholic Church and says that meaning of life is to make babies. Interesting. Uhm, but in order to make babies we need to have certain skills. Ah, it depends on our feeding, shelter, and mating activities all of which are reciprocals of avoidance behavior. So, he, Darwin, nail something that still isn't at the DSM namely what really messes up traumatized people is not only their nightmares and their flashbacks but when you are stuck in seeing the world as a traumatizing place, you cannot do all the cuddling and, ah, sweetness and, ah, patience and all the forbearance and all that stuff that you need to be a good lover and a good parent and I wish that the department of defense would have put out the last statement is somewhat simplified language in front of every recruiting station and-- that it would say, "Yes, you're-- I have no problem with you going abroad and killing beautiful people out there but if you do that, the likelihood that you will come back and not be able to be a good father or a mother to your own kids is going to be at very high risk because that's the price you pay. You cannot really successfully reproduce or be a good parent if you're freaked out all the time by your trauma. So, ah, it's pretty good. And for his spectra and indeed-- and then, then Darwin says, "The function of emotions," we didn't learn this at school, a whole bunch of stuff we didn't learn in school, and then he says, "The functions of emotions is to create movements and to make the movement between creatures." So, ah, the dog says to, to the mailman, "One step closer and I'll bite you in the, bite you in the ass," and the wife of Darwin's secretary, ah, when you look at it, it's all likely that they made love that night. So, it's like, ah, ah, and like "Get away from me." So, that's something we didn't learn at school. What we learn in school is, ah, we paid a lot of money for that and, and say like, when people say something and we say to them, "So, how do you feel about it?" Every people have a lot of feelings, you say, "Well, let's figure out what's going on." But we leave out two critical dimensions. One of which is what Darwin says, "Emotions are about movements," and the third person should ask what does your body want to do, does it want to be seated, does it want to get closer, what is your bodily attitude towards that thing? That's the number one issue. 

00:43:35
Darwin: The goal of emotion The goal of emotion.. is to effect physical movement and regain a state of physical equilibrium: "the .... liberated nerve-force .... produces in us the state we call feeling, [which] must expend and liberate itself in intense sensations, active thought, violent movements, or increased activity of the glands. evote.com The "pneumogastric nerve" Vagus - cranial nerve X Charles Darwin (1872): The Expression of Emotions in Man and Animals' Heart, guts and brain communicate intimately via the "pneumogastric" nerve, the critical nerve involved in the expression and management of emotions in both humans and animals. When the mind is strongly excited, it instantly affects the state of the viscera. 

00:43:35
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK And then the fourth issue, ah, I'm sorry, uhm, is that Darwin says we have a nerve, it's the-- you call that the pneumogastric nerve. This is like 140 years ago f-- before we knew anything but the brain. He says, "We have a nerve that runs from the brain into the brain," he says, "heart, guts, and brain communicates intimately via the pneumogastric nerve, the critical involved in the expression and management of emotions in both humans and animals. When the mind is strongly excited, it instantly affects the state of the viscera." And I read and I think, "Yeah, I know about it. When my girlfriend dumped back in college I had this horrible heartbreaking feeling over here and when I heard that somebody I love died, I this gut-wrenching feeling over here." And so, Darwin points something out that I think most of us don't learn in school namely that emotions are experience in your body. And by now, I have sort of figured out that trauma is helping your body and that trauma is a state of continuous heartbreak and gut-wrench. It's a state of continuously feeling things in your body that are unbearable. Ah, so it's not the stories that are unbearable. Your patients are very happy to tell you stories like when my girlfriend dumped me, I was very happy to go and talk to the therapist cuz I felt so much better when I really can talk to somebody because it gave me a momentary respite from have it vivid myself and my old heartbreaking feelings because it will not go away with the therapist but at least I got to talk to somebody who has made me feel so much better. Ah, and what we also know because I bet everybody in this room knows what heartbreaking and gut-wrench feels like is that when you have those feelings, they're unbearable and that we do anything to make those feelings go away, ah, and you may know the data that if you get, ah, traumatized as a kid, your chances to become a drug addict go up by a factor of 4600%. Basically, drug addiction is a function of trauma. It's almost impossible to become a drug addict without trauma and the reason why people become a drug addict is not because they love having a mind blown and being out of it and being inappropriate. No, it's because they have in-- they have gut-wrenching and heartbreaking feelings that are unbearable. Ah, and so all these things have to do with trauma and management of unbearable sensations in one's body. And the sort of what Darwin talks about way back a hundred times and it's not bad. And here is the picture of the pneumogastric nerve. It starts in the sort of arousal center of your brain and goes down into the back of the throat. And so, sometimes you are in certain places like talking in a meeting and suddenly you feel your throat become dry. And you-- does it ever happened to anybody, huh? And you feel okay, and now that I know Darwin and said, "Okay," when I get this dry throat, I think to myself, "Hmm. The back of my brain, my survival brain is sending a warning to my body that something is happening that is to be scared of." So, I start paying attention to what the back of my brain, my animal brain might be afraid of, ah, because that, that animal brain is sort of an independent bra-- life of that conscious brain that's all sensible and visible etcetera. And then the nerve goes down into your larynx and, ah, changes your voice. Remember the voice of the lady in the tape, remember when you maybe in the past few days, if any of you have teenage kids, you may have called home and your kid says, ah, you say, "How are you?" And your kid says, "I'm fine, mom." And you go like, "Oh my God! What are they up to?" And you say, "What are you up to?" "I'm fine, mom. I'm just doing my schoolwork," and the more you hear them talk, the more terrified you become, okay. Because the issue and this is really quite important, it struck me as some of the videotapes I saw today to other presentations is that your frontal lobe is made to tell stories. The function of our social brain is to be social and the function of storytelling is to be in connection with other people. It's a wonderful thing. It has a particular function. But that's not where the trauma sits. The trauma sits over here in survival brain that says to you all the time, "I'm screwed. I'm going to die. Terrible things are gonna happen to me." And these things can live quite independently from each other and so your frontal lobe could tell a nice story but the back of your brain may continue to have heartbreaking, gut-wrenching sensations. And that expresses yourself further down the line in the way you breathe, in your heart rate, in your gut, and trauma always leads to major disruptions in people's physical health because that part of the brain is in charge of both what is above it and what's below it. Uhm, and soon as Darwin finish his book, here comes the big revolution. In the last 20 years, people have discovered that the Vagus nerve, the pneumogastric nerve, 20% of the faber-- fibers are efferent nerve, they run from the brain into the body and 80% of them are afferent nerve, a-f-f, afferent nerve, they run from the body into the brain. And that should change the way that we practice mental health. How many people in this room do yoga or tai chi or qigong or something like that? Small numbers for ca-- Southern California. Some of you may not be from California, huh, or from Boston, okay. Ah, so why do people do silly things like standing on one foot and twisting yourself in a pretzel and doing happy baby pose and downward dog and stupid things that any, ah, you know, objective observer would look totally ridiculous. It's almost as crazy as, as this, ah. Uhm, why do we do that? Maybe we do it because when we come out of our yoga classes, we feel calm, we feel focused, we feel concentrated. Okay, and what we do actually is something that's to be practiced around the world by people who happened to be usually have a different skin color than most of us have because our European culture that most of us defy ourselves from happens to not have any tradition or hardly any tradition of learning to regulate your own physiology. Ah, that European and from that the American tradition is that if you feel bad, you take a gulp, ah, you swish something down your throat and you take alcohol to make it go away and that's still the predominant culture of the America is that if you feel bad ask your doctor for Zoloft, if you can't sleep ask your doctor for Lunesta, and it's all about top-down control over your behavior with chemicals and that it's nothing that we teach our kids in schools and people in the workplace that you could actually change your own physiology and you can actually teach yourself to be calm and you do that by breathing and your movement. And there's actually no question that sooner or later overtime our culture will change because at some point facts do matter and enough people will start doing yoga and stuff like that to say, "Actually, I don't need to ask my doctor for Zoloft because when I go running or when I go climbing or when I breathe differently or when I do meditation, actually, I feel much better than when I take this goddamn drugs and it's cheaper too." And so there's this little change but in order to do that, we have to truly honor that we are more than just little minds, that we are an organism, an organism that reacts to their environment, ah, in particular ways.

Clinical Implications of Neuroscience Research in PTSD BESSEL A. VAN DER KOLK Boston University School of Medicine, The Trauma Center, Brookline, Massachusetts 02446, USA Ann, N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1071: 277-293 (2006) © 2006 New York Academy of Sciences. Interoceptive, body-oriented therapies can directly confront a core clinical issue in PTSD, traumatized individuals are prone to experience the present with physical sensations and emotions associated with the past. If past experience is embodied in current physiological states and action tendencies and the trauma is reenacted in breath, gestures, sensory perceptions, movement, emotion and thought, therapy may be most effective if it facilitates self-awareness and self-regulation. PEANUTS THIS IS MY "DEPRESSED STANCE" HWEN YOU'RE DEPRESSED, IT MAKES A LOT OF DIFFERENCE HOW YOU STAND... THE WORST THING YOU CAN DO IS STRAIGHTEN UP AND HOLD YOUR HEAD HIGH BECAUSE THEN YOU'LL START TO FEEL BETTER... IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET ANY JOY OUT OF BEING DEPRESSED, YOU'VE GOT TO STAND LIKE THIS... 

00:51:50
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK So, uhm, we can regulate ourselves. Uhm, if you get stuck in a system that is miserable, your body adjust itself to it. So, you're seeing the cartoon art that really get it, so in order to change your feeling about the world, you need to change the way that you-- your body reacts to the world and that's something that is just stunning absent for me and most psychotherapist that if your patient sits in a chair, when your patients like this, just sit like for-- just sit like this for a second. Let it hang high and say, "Boy, I just love being in Disneyland." Ah, ah, ah, right, there is no way a person can feel okay as long as you sit like that and yet most therapist are perfectly fine to talk with people about their feelings and their horrible lives while their patients like this. Let me tell you, you're wasting your time and their money doing that. People cannot feel better as long as their body is in a position that they get only feel miserable which is what this feels like. Ah, and so you need to change people's bodily attitude. It's actually a very nice body of research that shows that if you-- as long as you hold your body in a position of rage, all you can feel is rage. If you feel-- hold your body in a state of depression, all you could feel is depression. And it starts over here and the moment you go like this the depression disappears. Even the moment I stand right here, I'm feeling quite good but I'm feeling even better the moment I go like this, ah, that's called the expression of joy. I become a more joyful person. You can do it right in your office, save your patient a lot of money, just do it.

00:53:40
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Ah, but-- so, so if the core of PTSD or being traumatized is having a body that keeps being filled with the sensations of agony, misery, etcetera, etcetera, uhm, what do you do? I think the choice is to two-fold. You either at that point start taking drugs which very many traumatized people do, about half of all people with PTSD, ah, start taking drugs, ah, you can't do it when you're a little kid and so particularly people who are beset by this heartbreaking, gut-wrenching feelings learn to isolate their bodily sensations to not feel the life in their bodies. That's called dissociation but it's physical dissociation. And so, the, the-- their bodies die on them. They don't feel what's going on their bodies, they don't feel the pain, but if you don't feel the pain, you also cannot feel the pleasure. And so the price that people pay for shutting out their connection with their body is a chronic sense of uselessness, meaninglessness, depression, joylessness, lack of sensuality.

00:54:55
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Ah, so, uhm, in order to get people to come back to li-- to life, they have to learn to feel their bodies and that's a very important part of, ah, the work we do is to help people there-- for their bodies to come alive. And to my mind aside from EMDR, ah, a very important of being a good trauma therapist is to learn to deal with people's bodies and my friend Peter Levine is here, he knows how to do that, he's taught me a lot about it, but often knows how to do this, ah, other-- a number of people who are really very good in helping, ah, sort of overly cerebral people like us to actually help people to actually open up their lives and their bodies.

00:55:40
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK And I'll show you a little of bit of that here also. Okay, so that's the first part. Now, let's go to the second part and the second part is that, uhm, I started off yesterday morning showing brain stuff and my fellow panelist said, "Ah, yeah, the brain. Ah, like, ah, who cares? I mean, the brain does that stuff, you know, let's not take it too seriously." Uhm, actually, the brain is sort of an important organ and the way it works, ah, we actually have learned some very important things. And if we take what we have learned from brain science seriously as people like Dan Siegel also does, uhm, then it has certain implications for the work that we do particularly the work for trauma. So, here's our brain and I, I really don't think you can be a good trauma therapist possibly unless you've get this. Ah, uhm, so here's our brain and when I introduced myself to you, I say, "Hi, my name is Bessel," what I really mean to say, ah, the name of this little sliver over here, my conscious self, his name is Bessel, and the rest of me just doing stuff of its own whether I get sleepy right now, I had no control over whether I get hungry right now, whether I like you or not, whether I get and itch or whatever, it's not up to me, okay. The majority of what happens in our brain is not on the conscious control and I'm really fascinated that I go to this conference to hear many presenters here, ah, having this undying faith that if you'd know something, you can change it. Actually, I'm always impressed when I'm dealing with traumatized people, how that's not the case, how many people-- t-- traumatized people are now who got themselves. Ah, nobody really thinks it's a great idea to got yourself and not much-- no matter how much understanding is there, people have-- doesn't go away. And it's not really a proud part of one's life if your sectional proclivities are to want to be beaten up by somebody and to be tortured by somebody. It's like, like the people don't do that because it's interesting, ah. It's because some other part of their brain makes them do that. Ah, and telling people, "Let's reframe this and don't do this and don't you see that," no, no, and even-- very clear from my experience because I'm a psychotherapist primarily, ah, even if we understand where it comes from, it doesn't make it go away because this becomes hardwired pedals of pleasure and pain and these, these are all located over here. The imprint of trauma is largely in our animal, emotional brain to which we have very little insight and it doesn't mean that talking isn't important. Talking is vitally important. You cannot be a human being without talking, if you do-- can't talk, you cannot make connections to people, if you cannot make connections with people, you have a miserable life, so talking is enormously important but talking doesn't resolve trauma. Talking resolves loneliness, talking resolves isolation, talking resolves feeling weird and being the only person who suffers from something. So I-- talking helps you to connect, very important but it doesn't resolve trauma and I think people really make a mistake if they think they can do that and don't learn the techniques that allow you to actually go into these deeper parts of the brain.

00:59:20
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK So, this is where trauma sits, ah, and so you've seen this before in the last few days. Ah, so our brain is basically buildup of three layers, so the triumvirate and at the bottom of our brain is this brainstem, there's a part of our brain with which become into the world that can do all the things that little babies can do, ah, which we tend to, ah, denigrate and not think highly of but, in fact, babies do wonderful things namely they can breathe, without breathing you can't live; they can poo and pee, really great thing to do, ah, they can sleep, fantastic; they can cry, uhm, and they can play with some toy above their crib and that's about it, okay. And so as psychologist, verbal people, be them to, ah, to not really pay much attention to it, the trouble is that trauma more than anything else affects that part of the brain. And so when you're traumatized, you cannot sleep, you're eating become disturbed or you sleep all the time and so that core regulatory part of your brain is messed up. And it's so stunning to me how the little-- most of us get taught in our professional training or afterwards about core regulatory functions but in our trauma center, that's what we do more than anything else to help people to regulate their bodies and we'll take more details about it. Ah, because as long as this core sort of arousal modulating system of the brain doesn't work as you know from having maybe had a colicky baby or something like that, as long as that part of your brain is not under control everything above it is not under control either. Ah, so most of us who are real serious trauma people who actually treat traumatized patients actually useful to treat them to say whatever it was, uhm, find out that people cannot get better until we take care of the core arousal system of their brain. That's where you start. You start from the basement. And the next piece is the limbic system. This is the part of your brain that comes align in the first six years of your life and if you'll hear Dan Siegel talk, you could see that keeps growing, it gets very affected by trauma later on our life but that is the part of your brain that forms the map of the world, it forms the map of, ah,-- if you're a little baby, you don't know who you are, you don't know what's out there, and your whole-- all your experiences lay down a map of who you are in relationship to the world that tells you who you can trust, who you have to be afraid of, what you like, what you hate, and that's a map that becomes hardwired, that becomes part of who you are and the first experience of the first ye-- six years of your life have a very profound and usually lasting effect of you who are. So, if you're a little kid and everybody loves you and you're cherished and everybody start smiling the mo-- the moment you enter the room, that becomes part of your experience and you think to yourself when somebody kisses you and slobbers you when you're forty-- 4-year-old kid you think, "I am a great kid. My-- look how happy my grandmother is when she kisses me," and no 4-year-old kid will say, "Ah, my grandma, she's Italian and she needs to hug people all the time but I'm just one out of 3 billion kids in the world. I'm just like everybody else." No, 4-year-old kids do not think that. And so, all these experiences become part of you. So, if you become abused, neglected, left alone, move from poster care to poster care, as it's the case incidentally of 60% of the California prison population, ah, then that becomes part of you. Ah, you basically get a concept of yourself of "I serve an evil presence in the world. I make people unhappy. Wherever I go, people frown and people are miserable." And so that becomes your core way, your core map of who you are in relation to the world. It's a map that is almost impossible to change because it's hardwired, ah. So, I know, like everybody else, for a long time I would say to my incest victims, ah, who always hated themselves like I would say, "Oh, you shouldn't feel that way. It wasn't your fault. Ah, you know, you're just like 4 years old, you know, you love your dad. You didn't know what is right or wrong, but your dad should have been responsible." And I said that many of for a long time and then one day in a group that I was leading and there was Cathy(ph) who, ah, said-- hating herself again, I said, "Ah, Cathy(ph), you know, it wasn't your fault that your father rape you when you're 4 years old," and she said, "You know, Bessel, uhm, you say these things, you know, and I know how important it is for you to feel like you're a good therapist, ah, uhm, you know, after all, I'm an incest victim so I was really raise to make big powerful guys happy and to serve their needs. And so, you know, I know what a narcissistic and vulnerable person you are so, you know, whenever you say this stuff to me, I go 'Oh, thank you very much.' But, you know, because I'm here to please you, that's my job in life. But, ah, you know, let me tell you the reality now that I've known you for a while is that when you say this stuff to me, I feel so lonely because, you know, I was hoping that you would get it and I feel deeply, fundamentally like an evil person. And then you finally get it, I feel like an evil person. Can you hear what I'm saying. I am an evil person, ah. And so you're stuff is just a way of pushing away my reality and tells me that you cannot stand here in depth." And I say, "Well, that's helpful. I wanted to say I won't charge you for this session." Uhm, and, you know, that really raises a very important issue and that is how can you take care of this horrible self-attributions if reason and understanding doesn't work? And it's difficult and I hope it's very much ended today with, with some important new advances there but let me just tell you one thing.

01:05:45
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uhm, the first time I saw that change was I was leading a group largely for incest victims and one of the members of the group was a PhD psychologist who also ran a group home for sexual abused girls, who also had been sexually abused herself, it seems to happen from time to time. And, ah, she got-- says-- she has often times made herself derogatory comments in the, in the class and the cla-- the, the group-- and the group and I always say, "Oh, you shouldn't feel that way," ah, which is the, the ultimately thing you should never say to people. Uhm, and so she feels totally misunderstood and gets more and more angry and then one day she comes in and she says, "I went to an EMDR training and see a PhD psychologist over the weekend and it's really helpful," and I start rolling my eyes as far as they go, "Oh my God! Another God follower here," and she says, "Can I talk about what happened?" Ah, now, I'm trying to be nice in group so I, I don't say-- I say-- almost say something like, "If you have to." Ah, not, not quite, you know, I'm trying to behave myself and she says, "You know, in my EMDR training I went back to myself as a 7-year-old kid who was being raped by her dad and I saw it, you know, and I was about this big, I was this crony little ba-- little girl and he was this big, weigh off guy who was lying on top of him-- me and pushing himself to me. It's disgusting. How can a big guy do that to a little girl like that?" And she really seemed to have resolved the issue in one EMDR session because she was able to visit herself with that adult frontal lobe and to notice what happened to her when she was little. And that to my mind is really the core of how you deal with children trauma is to you have to make it possible for people to go deeply inside themselves and to notice right from the adult point of view what happened to them back there and to really see what that little kid went through. But I-- actually, I hope to show you a videotape where, where this comes up more. Uhm, so this issue of these core beliefs and core assumptions, you know, I hear all the psychologists who say, "I can change his beliefs and assumptions." Maybe I'm just really, ah, not very talented therapist. I tried to change my teenage kids' assumptions and beliefs also. I wasn't particularly successful in it. I tried to change the beliefs of my colleagues and show the, the error of their ways, it doesn't seem to work either. You know, I, I find that rational discourse is not really all that helpful much of the time.

BESSEL VAN DER KOLK I know what your experiences but, ah, I'm not a great believer in reason. I'm a be-- believer that you can design beautiful experiments and write beautiful books, but really change people through words? Maybe, maybe not. Okay. And so we have, have-- we have learned to map the brain right now, we know all these different structures that I involved in different mental processes and let me just go through it quickly. And so one of the first studies on what happens when people have deep emotions was done by Antonio Damasio and what he shows is that these deep emotions are held in the cerebellum, in the top of the brainstem, all parts of the brain that you really have no access to. And so, it sends messages up I'm feeling terrible but you cannot send messages back there and say you shouldn't because you're really in good shape. So, you know, there's just no pathways there.

Damasio: Structures Supporting the Proto-self insula brain-stem hypothalamus and basal 

01:09:40
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uhm, and let me get into something that's very important and that is where people get their core sense of themselves, ah, again, Antonio Damasio, the core sense of who you are is located in these areas of the brain. This is the parietal lobe, the parietal lobe picks up sensations in your body. Ah, this area here, very central, it's called the insula. The insula is the part of your brain that notices what's going on inside of your body, it's sort of the connecting piece between body and brain and it tells you what your body needs, it tells you that it's cold outside, that you need to wear a glove. When you hear a piece of music, you say, "That's a sort of music I want to hear because my body feels happy when I listen to that music." Uhm, the insula is almost invariably very damaged in traumatized people, their own sensations in their bodies are very severely compromised and because of that they have a he-- ho-- hell of a time feeling pleasure, feeling joy because all the things come from deep inside your body. So, at the end, the loss of joy and pleasure becomes a gigantic part of treating traumatic stress and you cannot reset that unless you start living in a body that you like and feel safe, okay.

Imaging TRAUMATIC SCRIPT II. You are in the hospital emergency room lying on a stretcher, but feeling as if you were standing on its head. You hear doctors' words echoing, asking if you are pregnant. You try hard to understand, but just can't remember. Your little boy is talking to someone in another room, but you don't hear Katie. When the doctor comes in, you know something is wrong. He tells you have been in an accident. Your heart skips a beat, and you feel sweaty and nauseous. Then you hear him say: ' we could not do anything for your little girl. She is dead.' Your body feels heavy and you start to cry. 

01:11:05
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Ah, okay, so maybe time for a break pretty soon but let me just start with this. I talked about it before. So, we actually did the first brain imaging study of trauma in order-- the, the-- of people having a flashback. And so, in order to get what the flashback is like, we had to make, ah, just like how do you get a flashback and as a clinician, uhm, it's important to know that. But I, I think many of you probably notice intuitively but it's good to be explicit about it. As long as you stay in the storytelling mode, the storytelling part of the brain, uhm, you can sort of talk story, ah, you can talk about stuff and you do not get into your trauma. If you want to get into your trauma, you have to go it to exquisitely precise details as in what did you see, what did you hear, what did he smell like, what does it like to have hi-- his weight on your body. Ah, the more precise you go into the details of the experience, the more you go into that core experiential self which is the self that is both necessary to change but also the part of the self that gets really hijacked by trauma. So, if you want to stay away from trauma, talk, tell stories and people will feel-- look great because they're able to explain why they feel bad. And it won't actually change the core thing cuz the only way you can change traumatic stress is if you lay the sensations deep in your body to rest and transform to-- into a sense of safety and belonging. So, what you see here and you probably read it by now is a, is a script that we made for a particular person, a person who picked up her daughter from school at the end of the day, she lean over to fasten her daughter's seat belt because the seat belt was beeping and she did so, she went through a red light and her daughter was killed as well as the 8 months old fetus she was carrying. And so when people talk about resilience, I don't-- cannot relate to that very much because almost every story that my patients tell me are stories and they go like, "Oh my God! How can anybody survive this?" I find all these talk about resilience very superficial most of the time.

01:13:30
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uhm, so this one you'll find-- this is the composite picture of, ah, eight people having flashbacks in the scanner, the first neuroimage ever of traumatized people. And what you see here is a cross-section of the brain, it's the front of the brain, back of the brain, it's a mirror image of this to right, here's the back and what you see is a big area that lights up is your right animal brain, your right survival brain. It sits over here, it's the part of your brain you have in common with your dog and your cat and your local giraffe and your tiger, all these stuff, nothing do with cognition. Uhm, so that's where the trauma sits, that's where the imprint of trauma is. Uhm, what you also see is that in the back of the brain, the occipital cortex lights up. Thus the people actually are at this point seeing an image of what happens. They see the rape or the, or the torture or whatever that's traumatizing them at that point. Uhm, this was the, to my mind, the most important finding, the most surprising one and what this shows is that when people go into their trauma, they shut down the area over here, the left anterior prefrontal cortex. This happens to be Broca's area, this happens to be the speech center of the brain. And so, this picture is on my refrigerator for half a year before I wrote up the study, ah, because it was so intriguing to me. Cuz when it showed it was then people go into their trauma, the, the speech-- their capacity for speech disappears. They become dumbfounded or Sh-- Shakespeare said, "They got struck with speechless terror." Shakespeare was always right about these things. Ah, and so, that's that story I've had interesting finding because what we see here is that when people go into their trauma they cannot talk, they cannot talk about and I go, "Oh, that's interesting," because I thought that in order to get over their trauma people need to talk about it. But that turns out that when you get traumatized your speech center of your brain shuts down, you saw a little intimation of that in that lady in the videotape who becomes sort of a little bit like a bumbling idiot as she starts talking about her trauma because her animal brain is firing like crazy and she can barely sputter outwards. So, this is really, you know, f-- in my mind, this is fascinating this is a very, ah, the first study (inaudible ) number of studies have replicated this and this retells us when people are in their trauma which also is the only way you can resolve your trauma by-- is by going there, they lose their capacity for speech. And at the same time that we do this, cognitive treatment becomes the predominant thing that people teach in graduate schools and they go like, "Ah, but didn't we just show that cognition goes off alignment when people go through their trauma." So, we live in this very polarized world. So, if people say you do cognitive treatments and the results of which are really quite miserable, uhm, I believe that in the neuroscience world where they show that people can actually not talk about it.

01:16:40
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK So that becomes quite important and becomes important in the videotapes I'll show you about this. Uhm, what's also-- we-- what we also find, uhm, is that show-- you saw this before is that when people go into their trauma, when they reliving like your irrational partner with a temper tantrum, uhm, when you try to argue with your partner at this point and say, "Don't you see that I just have to deliver some (inaudible ) whether you're getting," do you find that helpful? Do you ever sort of settle your differences when your honey is out of control and seems to be so on her his-- hissy fit and say, "Oh yeah, don't you see? Let's, let's be rational. Ah, it doesn't work." Okay. You just get out of the room and say, "Take a deep breath, gonna make your cup of coffee, huh? You don't argue with people at this point," because we have learned as you human beings that when people are like that, that reason and discussion don't work. It's funny how in our personal life we know that but as therapist we still sort of keep hoping that what doesn't work in their personal life will work. I don't, I don't get them. Ah, and so-- and what happens when people are in their, in their trauma, the left side of the brain, the area over here which is about understanding, figuring things out, words, all those sort of stuff, out of the window and the right side of the brain takes over and the right brain-- side of the brain picks up emotions but doesn't pick up breathing. So, when people go into their trauma, they become deeply unreasonable, have you ever notice that? Well, hard to argue with but that's reality.

BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uhm, so let me see-- no, we don't have time for this. It's about, ah,-- let's start here after, after the break. So, I want you take a 10-minute break, don't stay away for too long because I like to tell you a lot of stuff. Uhm, okay. Uhm, the questions that people are asking me here are all very important deep and well-thought art questions and because we only have three hours, I cannot answer them all. Uhm, but there is hope. Uhm, every year I teach in Esalen in Big Sur and it's a largely experiential workshop where we practice what we preach. And so if you can take the first week of February off and come to Esalen for some price that I don't know what it is because you're paying to Esalen. Uhm, if you're really intrigued to this, come, come there and we'll be able to talk and I'll talk about the things outside the session all that stuff. Uhm, you know, you cannot really squeeze that much into three hours. I also have a new book coming out, it's sort of compilation of everything I know, know but-- 10% of what I know but it's pretty good. Uhm, and, ah, it's called The Body Keeps The Score, ah, Viking Press, will be out in June but you can get free order at Amazon. It's a popular book. 

01:19:55
UNKNOWN Could you please repeat the title? 

01:20:00
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK The Body Kee-- it seem that's the title of this workshop actually, it's called The Body Keeps The Score and it's Viking Press and you'll like it. It's-- I, I li-- I like it. You know, I know you've like it yourself. Okay. So, I'm sort of inching toward showing you a videotape to sort of put a, put a stuff together but I have to tell you few more other things. Uhm, it goes-- this stuff is f-- you need to know where it all started. I like to say that triggering trauma is like neurosurgery and-- except you get paid about 10% of what's, ah, neurosurgery get paid but it's just as complicated. I mean, these are not stuff for amateurs. Meaning, you need to know a lot of stuff. Uhm, you know, you don't go, "Oh, I need a cardiac surgery. Let me just go to somebody who just learned about cardiac surgery," like that. It's a big step. Uhm, so, what you see here is a picture of an accident and the two people I'm about to talk about were in this particular action the day before, ah, when all of this was cloaked in, ah, gigantic cloud of mist. Ah, this happened on Road 124 between London, Ontario, and Windsor. I don't know if how many of you know that road but it's a road there and at one point in January about 10 years ago, a couple sets out to the road in the morning and they drive into a fog bank and as they drive into this fog bank, not everybody has seen fog banks, but-- you can't see anything. Ah, they drive into a patch of black ice, they hit a car in front of them, the moment they hit the car in front of them a big mako shark like this dive into the back of their car, squishes their car, it doesn't kill them but they sit in this demolished vehicle and they cannot open the doors. Their cur-- their current number is 36 out of the 78 car pileup, the worst in Canadian history and I know two people who are there. And so, these people sitting in this car, it's-- they can't see anything, they see flames, they hear people screaming, they hear crashes, it's a scene from Dante's Inferno, uhm, ah, the guy desperately tries to fight it hopefully to get out of the car because he thinks he's going to die, ah, he can't find it and he sort of beginning to give up and then the firefighter comes by and smashes the windshields of the car, he can climb out, he climbs out, he turns around see what's happening in his wife, his wife is frozen in her seat. Ah, it's a beautiful example of the two ways in which people can react to trauma either to fight or flight what he does, or to freeze which she does. Uhm, so the firefighter and she pull her out of the car, they go to the side of the road, ambulance has come to the hospital, ah, they're declared fit, they go back to work, they don't have kids and they love their work and they hope that if they're just going to work, ah, they'll feel like nothing has happened. And so, ah, that night they can't sleep and then next day they become irritable and they start quarreling and fighting and they have nightmares and they get scared to death and everything begins to fall apart because the stress hormones are bumping and they feel horrible and irritable and angry in their relationship, they can't be there for each other and things are very bad and after about three months of that, they visit their GP and say, "We are so terrified about what's happening with our lives. We're even willing to see a psychiatrist." Ah, it takes a lot, you know, to declare yourself crazy. And so, ah, their GP says you are in luck because we have a very good person here in London, her name is Ruth Lanius who's a former student of mine and has-- who has evolved into, to my mind, about the best neuroscientist in the area of trauma and, and he says, "I have to warn you against Ruth because she may-- she's a neuroscientist. She has access to the best neuroimaging equipment and she may require that you put your head in the cooker before she's going to treat you." Ah, they say, "We'll do anything," they're desperate. So they go see Ruth and-- who said, "I'll be happy to do that but I first about to take a scan of your brain." So Ruth makes a script again with the same way that I showed you before, what did you see, what did you hear, what did you smell, and a lot of horrible details come out and he lies in the scanner, he begins to relive it, he goes into, ah, flashback, he comes out, he's a bit thirsty, his heart rate is up, his blood pressure is up and he said, "Oh my God! This is just like the time of the trauma. I thought I was going to die." Ah, typical traumatic stress response. This is his brain. Brain is now lying on its side, the front of his brain, back of his brain, right of his brain, left of his brain, and just like in our scan, the left of the brain, the analyzing, the figuring things out so it go. The right side of his brain over here, just like our scan, ah, the right limbic system, the right animal brain lights up. Uhm, he also has activity in his prefrontal cortex. Interesting. So, he's thinking I'm going to die. To my, to my mind this is very interesting because a lot of our patients have these negative cognitions. They say, "I'm a piece of shit. I'm no good." And some people like to argue with that. Don't. Treat them as if they're cognitive flashbacks, this is what they were thinking at the time of the trauma not a contemporary statement, a statement that is lingering at the mind from the trauma and if you do something like EMDR, you say, "Notice what you're thinking and stay with that." Don't argue with it, it won't go away if you argue with it. Don't charge them money, arguing with them won't work. But if you treat it like a flashback, it will become integrated in most relatively simple cases and these people are simple cases, one time corrections. Uhm, so, is this guy-- we're on his right mind, he would say, "Boy, I was remembering something that happened long time ago or three months ago and it was really awful and I'm so feeling the memory of my body." Now, that's nobody's feeling. You think, "I was back there." So, he has this faulty cognition that acutely need to be rectified by saying, "You stupid idiot! You're lying in a scanner in the hospital, you shouldn't feel that way." But why does he feel that way anyway? Because it is the right holes. These two right holes are the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex which is the site of your working memory, your site of your-- the-- this part of your brain allows you to knit together past, present, and future so that, that part of your brain tells you, "That was then and this is now." When that part of your brain gets wiped out you feel like this is forever and what I'm feeling right now will last forever. You cannot tell people "You shouldn't feel that way," because that part of the brain is gone. And the main thing you need to do as a psychotherapist is to just make sure that this part of the brain is align when you talk with people and they'll be fine. That's all you need to do. Go home now. Uhm, but-- see, when you do (inaudible ) exposure treatment with these people you'll wipe out that part of the brain again and people will get re-traumatized because you need this part of the brain and this part of the brain which I'll talk about in a second, in order to integrate the trauma and to say, "That was then and this is now." And so, that's why we all need to become sort of a little amateur and neuroscientist and that our job is to keep the brain functioning and to keep the brain from getting hijacked to have the same brain that people had at the time of the trauma because if this piece of the brain that were knocked out now just like they were at the time of the trauma, they will get re-traumatized by reliving the trauma, that's why you should not do it. I'm really looking forward to go into curriculum sometime and testify this because it's very bad practice to blast people with the memories of the trauma. It's wrong. It's re-traumatizing, okay. So, the thing is you need to help people to stay calm so that they can knit it together and I'll show you a movie of how I do that. Well, there are so many ways of doing that but I'll show you one way. Uhm, the other part of the brain that is out over here is lateral nucleus of thalamus. The thalamus is the part of your brain that is active right now, ah, so you hear the sound of my voice, you look at me, at the slides and me, ah, you feel your body against the chair, you may smell some perfume of somebody but that's not your experience. Your experience is that I'm sitting in here in this gigantic hotel room in Anaheim listening to some guy with a funny accent talking about the brain. And so, you immediately translate what's happening to you into a story. That translation into a story is courtesy of your thalamus. The thalamus is the cook of your brain that puts the sensations in your body together into a story. And so right now, you're obviously not getting traumatized by me, thank you very much, huh, ah, you hear an ongoing story, what goes on, because your thalamus is, is align. When you get traumatized, the thalamus shuts down and what do you remember if-- will be some horrendous event here but you will remember is the flash of fire or the blood that you see. Hence, you would see something and that's-- that image would stay with you for maybe the rest of your life, huh, and that's because your thalamus gets wiped out and the sensations get undrafted on your brain and don't become a story. I wish people would know that because it's sort of like, "Duh! That's what traumatic stress is about," that these little pieces have a life of their own and when you once again smell that smell or see that sound-- or hear that sound or see, see that image, your whole brain starts going back to that scene and you become-- all of your, ah, body just start reliving it. It's not a mental event. Frontal lobe has nothing to do with that. And so the other thing is you need to get-- keep the thalamus alive. That's all you need to do and the rest is, ah, is okay. So that's one piece. Then his wife, luckily, ah, had the opposite response. His wife has a very common post-traumatic response and that's the part that people keep ignoring it because she is put in the scanner, she's given the script, and her heart rate doesn't come up, go up and her-- she's not spreading as she comes out looking like a zombie and she says, "I felt just the same way as I felt in the car accident, I felt nothing," and people who feel nothing are the hardest people to treat because they sit with us and they may tell us horrendous stories but there's no affect and they may say, "Oh, I was raped as a child but ah..." and they sit there and does, does something to your mirror neuron system because we affect each other's physiology and when you sit with a dissociated shutdown person, before too long, you start shutting down because their mirror neuron system may be more powerful than yours and you sit with this patient and you start becoming sleepy or you start thinking, "I am becoming a monster. Somebody is telling me a horrible story and I don't feel anything." Have it ever happens to you? This is-- they'll be our-- ah, Dan Siegel really loves talking about this that if you're-- we have interpersonal neurobiology. We affect each other's survival level and so when you sit with somebody who doesn't feel anything, sooner, ah, you'll start not feeling something. And, uhm, you said people who we tend of really-- tend to do nasty things too because it make them feel so helpless. And so, our countertransference goes out of control and we give people like that shock treatment and we torture them one way or another because nobody wants to feel helpless, ah, and so-- and they get terrible labels, is treatment resistant and the patient doesn't like to get better and patient is passive or aggressive. Uhm, this handles for the additional things, they are not things that people want and for me the picture of this woman's brain was incredibly help-- helpful and I hope it'll be for you also. That's how the brain looks like, okay. Uhm, it doesn't mean she is Terri Schiavo, she's not-- it's not like she's brain dead but every part of her brain is, to standard deviation, is less active. There's just nothing much there and I bet that most people in this room have seen these patients who are just not present. Uhm, and what I used to do in my office because I was trained like riding 50 meters because before we could only do 50 meters be-- do, ah, cigars so now we all treat patient from 50 meters and so, ah, uhm, and so our patient is, is space out at the end of the 50 meters, you-- your time is up and your patient sits there and you say, "Your time is up. We really have to go now," and patient just sits there and a little bit so the patient feels herself loose, ah, sits in the waiting room and then half an hour later while you were with your next patient you hear the ca-- her car start up in the parking area and then see her drive away. In that respect, that's a malpractice on my part. You should not let people that are totally space out drive. That's irresponsible. The reason why I cannot talk about it is now I know how to take care of it and I help-- know how to help people to not be space out. As long as you don't know anything else, you have an excuse to continue to do it, once you know how to not do it, you're no longer excuse to send people home. Uhm, what I do with patients who are out a bit is tapping. Uhm, how many people here know about tapping? More people then do yoga, it's fantastically interesting, huh. Uhm, it was like, ah, shall we go some tapping or, or shall we just continue with this? Yeah. Okay. Uhm, so tapping is in other world. It comes from-- it's been marked as-- it's EFT in this country but it really is, you know, old accurate pressured practices and it's based on Chinese medicine. About qi, nobody knows anything be-- begin to translate Western medicine and all that stuff that I like to do into Chinese medicine. So, all of these concepts, I have to go like, "Okay, if you say so. I understand it doesn't make any sense." But if you twist your ear hear, it goes through your left spleen, I don't know. It doesn't show up when you do image studies but something happens. Uhm, so right now, ah, recently, the Chinese government says to increase the budget for researching qi or chi by millions of dollars because they don't want somebody in Brookline, Massachusetts to find out what qi is and they want to actually do it themselves and so they go. Uhm, so, anyway, so this is but a Chinese say we should do. We should first tap reversal parts and I hope you will do this with me. I'm not going to do it unless all of you do it because otherwise we're wasting everybody's time. Uhm, and so you tap the reversal parts, don't know what it means, uhm, and then you tap another reversal part, just tapping your hand, and notice if you notice anything happening. But if you do it more often, you start feeling the effects. I, I feel the effects these days but not initially. And then you tap your superciliary ridges called right here and then you tap your zygomatic arch right here, do it, it's good for you. You can learn something. And you tap underneath your eyeballs - 

01:36:20

01:36:25
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK - and you tap upper lip, you tap your lower lip, and you tap acupuncture area number 27 which is a part on your chest an inch below your clavicle, an inch right beside your sternum. It's more sensitive (inaudible ) it's very powerful, acupressure pull. And then you tap on the side of your ribs over here then everybody feels equal because we all look like monkeys, and you tap over here. Uhm, people are finally beginning to do some research on tapping and the f-- first piece of research that has been done showed that you have a decreased limbic system activation if you tap. It's sort of interesting because that's what we see clinically. Ah, so, before I start seeing my traumatized patients unless they are pretty high level I always do, I always do tapping because tapping used to be a part of the procedural memory system. We've done it regularly so that when they start phasing out, when they start getting traumatized they still remember procedurally what to do when you tap because at that point language and words don't-- have disappeared. Uhm, if I'm in a particular good mood, I also do qigong with my patients and help them to-- so, imagine a ball between your hands, it expands, it contracts, it goes up. Ah, very nice, uhm, very nice to sort of stabilize somebody and to take care of that, ah, that, that reptilian brain. And if I'm particularly in, ah, outrageous mood which you will be if you come to Esalen, we will do some chanting and some oming. Oming, of course, all religious practices around the world make this long out sound even Gregorian chants and joyous singing and Hindu singing and Muslim singing, we'll do it. And why did we do it? Because it works. Ah, otherwise people-- nobody would come back to the temple, to the church anymore because that stuff makes you feel better and so long our breath like, "Oh..." calm down your parasympathetic nervous system, achieves the arousal system in your-- back your brain that make you feel calm. To my mind, this is like the first course or the second course that everybody should have taken in professional training because, you know, you need to help your patients to calm themselves down and if you did that dangerous work of therapy that we do, you need to help people to not lose their brain, okay. Okay, uhm, so that's, that's it.

BESSEL VAN DER KOLK So, I want to show you a lot of stuff so let me just quickly go through, through things. Uhm, so this is a slide from the great neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux that he gave to me and what LeDoux is similar to what we came up a little bit later in this case but there's much better neuroscience under-- underpinnings is that if this is the brain and you're threatened, the first thing that your stress hits is something in your limbic system and your-- the LA, lateral nucleus of the amygdala, the smoke detector, evaluates the sound that comes in, ah, for clearly nobody hear is traumatized by my doctor accent, otherwise you'll be left a long time ago because the amygdala would've send signals like, "Oh, this guy is a bad guy," and, and you have left, ah, because your amygdala decides whether images or sound are dangerous for you.

01:40:20
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Uhm, so if you have an actual threat, it first hits that smoke detector of your brain and then what LeDo-- LeDoux shows if that-- if that then activates, the basal ganglia, i.e., the movements or the signal part of your brain that, that tells you to move and actu-- actually move as a result, you set up a circuit of competence and pleasure. And sot threat in of itself is not bad for you. It's inescapable threat that's bad for you. Who knows better than anybody else, uhm, surgery departments but not so many surgeons here, ah, actually surgery at some part, uhm, US Marine Corps. Ah, what did they do? They get this pimply or horny adolescents in that are no good and then put them for basic training. And it's brutal and at the first night kids go to bed after sort of mud and climbing stuff and nature and they get f-- machine gun fire over their heads, it's just brutal. And every night they go like, "Oh my God! I survived nor are they. I don't think I'm gonna drive tomorrow, but let me try again." And so night-- day after day they get ex-- exposed to extreme stress and everyday they survive and by that time basic training comes o-- up every Marine thinks they are whole shit and they are because their brain has been trained to be extraordinarily focused, calm, precise and they're very good at what they do. Uhm, no, particularly a lot of Marines didn't know anything about Marine Corps (inaudible ) but I got a lot of respect for these guys, they're good. And it's all because of pushing people to the limit, ah, when I did my surgery rotation, they pushed us to the limit, ah, and when you come out with this extreme situations and you survive, you go like, "Hmm! I can do it. I'm good."

01:42:10
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK So, that's good but Le-- LeDoux shows that if you blocked that movements, so if you tied people down, I li-- like to give the example of how many people in this room were tortured by an older brother or tortured a younger sibling themselves? Oh, there's a very low torture crowd, it's interesting. Uhm, I was a recipient and donate-- donor of both, uhm, and I remember older brother holding me down very vividly and how enraging it is to be little, terrifying you, hold your hand, you can't do anything, you go like, "Ah!" And my younger brother at age 65 is still enraged with me that I did it to him, I forgive my older brother but my younger brother is somewhat-- uhm, okay. Uhm, ah, but, but it fe-- we know the feeling of being held on and not being able to move most-- many of us do.

01:43:05
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK So, if that happens, it bypasses this action system and goes into the, ah, central nucleus of, of the amygdala and at that point you'll secret your stress hormones but it becomes dissociated from action. And so, what you get instead of wanting to move, wanting fight is you get a panic reaction and you feel helpless very much what happens with our traumatized people. And so, in-- neuroscience people, research people say, "Oh, the, uhm, the emotional memories of the amygdala are forever." In-- many therapist, therapist people say, "Oh, you can just make a narrative out of it and you can change it." Uhm, the second part, we know for sure, is wrong. The first part, we're not so sure about it but I'll show you a videotape that's, uhm, makes me believe that they can actually (inaudible ) the amygdala.

01:44:05
BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Ah, I showed what you ought to do and he fell asleep during this tape which is fascinating. Ah, it's very hard for people to learn new stuff, you know, like the moment you see anything new that contradicts to specially held beliefs they fall asleep or they start arguing with you. It's a, it's, it's amazing like I'm, I'm just amazed. We're all of you guys trying to learn something, it's so rare. Uhm, most people just want to be affirmed. My most common comment after I give a training is "Thank you so much, you affirmed everything I'm doing," and I say, "Did you learn anything new?" He said, "No, nothing," okay. So, uhm, as, as a therapist we sometimes-- we think, we think we have a corner of the market of good practices but this particular program that I'm about to show you was a program that was invented by Karate teachers in Oakland. It's called Impact Model Mugging. Some of you may have heard about it. And the big round of this is that about 30 years ago, a woman who is a fifth-degree black belt instructor-- karate instructor in, ah, Oakland was raped and her colleagues go together and said, "How is it possible that our friend got raped because she can kill anybody with her bare hands?" And thinking about it, they realized that maybe she had become de-skilled and they realized something that we all know but sometimes forget is that when we get anxious, we lose our skills. We've all been there, ah, and we become blubbering idiot when we get scared and we forget how good we are. And so, they realized that, that even the most powerful person can become de-skilled when they get frightened and they thought we should have a program that helps traumatized member to become deeply mindful because if you're mindful, you can stay focused and noticed what's going on. And not only that but we'll teach them self-defense, we'll teach them karate and so we'll do this combined. Mindfulness, karate teaching thing and then the gra-- at the graduation ceremony, you will see the gradua-- the graduation ceremony of one of my patients, uhm, we will expose people to the same trigger, we'll have set things up very much like the original trauma and this time we'll have them take action, as before they ought to do it, they've done this work, had these karate instructors intuitively almost do the right thing. And so this is what the program looks like. That is how you reset the amygdala, okay, it's with action, action that contradicts the original helplessness, victimhood before. It's fascinating, you know, I was just in Brazil early this year. Everybody seems to be in Brazil right now and, ah, I was in Bahia which is said the world's capital of capoeira and, you know, and you go to the slums of Boston and New York and other places and these kids are doing boxing and martial arts, etcetera, etcetera. That's not just an escape, that is treatment. These kids are doing that because it's good for them, ah. So, what do we actually see here? Uhm, my patient just expose to a situation that she is now terrified of and by training, etcetera, etcetera, she's help to stay calm and now she's exposed to the said who was identified as Guy Langer(ph) over here, uhm, and now she has two memories living side by side. One is the big comes up to me and tells me terrible things, I'm going to be helpless. But she has the second memory which is if, if a big guy like this comes up to me, I can kick him in the groin and have him scream in the ground and it felt really good. And so, you need to actually have visceral imprints of something that used to be bad feeling good. I think very few people in this room including to some degree, I, are really at the points that we actually are putting that into practice. But this is good stuff, this is trauma therapy. Uhm, the follow up I know because my patient is a student at a little known little university at Cambridge, Massachusetts, uhm, and she has been a very, very traumatized person and I've done EMDR with her before she went to this and she did made really well. Uhm, and after her graduation she calls me up about three months later and said, "Can I stop by? I have some amazing thing to tell you?" And what she tells me is that two nights before she was studying at the Widener big library at that, that school and it's midnight and the lights go off and go, she go home, she takes the books in her book as she was walking home and an Oxford street in Cambridge three guys come from behind the bushes and say, "Bitch! Give me your money." And I say when you're at that I went like, "Okay guys, I have been trained for this. Which one of you would like to turn me on?" And I said very said they've ran away and I don't have the chance to parti-- ah, you know, good outcome. I don't need to do, uhm, PTSD score on her to know that she's doing okay, you know, okay. So that, that's piece number one.

BESSEL VAN DER KOLK Piece number two is this one. You saw it-- you see it before yesterday somewhere, it's a very important side also coming from the lab of Joe LeDoux and Joe LeDoux is very aware, of course, of that emotional brain, that back part of the brain. Some of you may have heard his, uhm, his books actually. It's very good, very good. I hope he still get some Nobel Prize for it. And so what LeDoux's research shows is that the rational understanding, figuring out the part of the brain has no pathways to your emotional brain, okay. If you have ever been in love with the wrong person, maybe some people have tried to talk you out of it and tell you, "You shouldn't be in love with this guy," and you-- your rational brain said, "I was sort of-- yeah, I shouldn't be in love with guy but I am," ah. You cannot talk yourself out of that sort of stuff. If you have enough bad experiences, you may learn your lesson, you may-- but this is not a rational process. And so what LeDoux shows is that you cannot really talk, analyze yourself out of that experiences but that's not the end of the story. The next part of the story and this is a very important one. Ah, I mean, this is as important as the story as anything I know, uhm, is that, ah, there is part of our brain that actually can access our emotional brain. That part of our brain is our middle part of our brain. So, the way that our b-- our brain has build up and it's-- now it gets on these core issues that, I think, we all should know as therapist is that, uhm, our social brain-- a-- anybody raised kids which I assume most of you in this room, okay, know that when your kid comes in the world, it's all emotions and all impulses are nothing and then slowly your kid becomes a little civilized kid and that by age 6, they're sort of ready-- ha-- have enough civilization in them to go school and to learn something, okay. All that brain growth is largely on the side of your brain, ah, we're deeply social creatures. Most of our brain is devoted for us to connect with each other. Uhm, very important part of our brain gets very interfered by being tra-- traumatized because you have a hard time connecting to these people so being in a relationship with the therapist is terribly important. Uhm, but, again, it's not the part of your brain that has access to your emotional brain. The part of your brain that has access to the emotional brain is the part of your brain that runs like mohawk inside of you, it starts right above your eyes, orbital, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, ah, medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, it runs right here and that part of your brain is devoted to you, ah. Anybody who has ever meditated or does yoga, you don't do a lot of yacking in connection with other people, you pay attention to your breath, to your body, to your sensations, to your tensions of your body. That's all about activating that self-sensing interoceptive system. The weight of the evidence is profound and that's the only system through which you can change your emotional brain. There's a robust research that shows that if you increase the si-- the size of your brain, you become more and more in charge of yourself. I may actually say a little bit more about it if we have time. Uhm, so let me show you a videotape and then we'll see what else if we have time for it. So, this video tape was taken a few years ago when I was sitting in audio-- in auditorium slightly smaller than this one, ah, and people ask me to interview somebody and to show how to do things. So, uhm, I didn't know what to expect and I meet this lady who is holding on her therapist and say, "My therapist has to be here and I won't inter-- be interviewed by you without my therapist," and I say, "Do I look really scary to you? You know, like we can probably manage without you holding on to somebody." So, finally she sits down with just two of us and so I ask her, "So, how are you doing?" Ah...
