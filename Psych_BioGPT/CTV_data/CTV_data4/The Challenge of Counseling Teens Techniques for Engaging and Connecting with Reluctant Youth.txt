MICROTRAINING ASSOCIATES INCORPORATED TEL/FAX 888-505-5576 WWW.EMICROTRAINING.COM MICROTRAINING ASSOCIATES PRESENTS THE CHALLENGE OF COUNSELING TEENS BY JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN AND RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN 

00:00:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  My name is John Sommers-Flanagan. I'm a counselor educator at the University of Montana and I have training in clinical psychology. For many years, I have immensely enjoyed working with challenging teenagers. Although it might be more accurate to say that I've almost always immensely enjoyed my work with them. Before moving to the video clips, I want to give my sincere thanks to the six teenagers who, through their generosity allowed, uhm, us to video them while they work with me in counseling. They were open. They were responsive. They were more than I could have asked for. And so this tape couldn't have been possible without their contribution. I also would like to thank my wife and colleague, Dr. Rita Sommers-Flanagan. And she is here to share some of her comments and wisdom about the video clips that we're going to be watching together. 

00:01:30
DR. RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN This first clip that we'll watch together shows John doing an opening technique with a very interesting young woman. What should we watch for, John? 

00:01:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, I had asked this girl to work with me and, uhm, I found that I haven't met her before. And so I found, even in the video set-up, that I started kind of absorbing or reacting to her energy 'cause she's pretty lively and pretty active. And I know when I watched the video, the whole thing, much of which won't be shown on this tape that I got overactive and directive and found myself strongly affected by her energy. 

00:02:10
DR. RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. I, I think, I've, of course, watched the tape, too. And I think it would be very interesting for you, as viewers, to really imagine yourself in the room with this young client and monitor your own responses. 

00:02:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Right. 

00:02:25
MEGAN Yeah. 

00:02:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so, Megan, you know, we're kind of, we're kind of strangers. I mean, I think we don't know each other well. 

00:02:30
MEGAN No. 

00:02:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Just barely met. And so, uhm, ah, I would just like to try to be of some help in some way, if you want that, uhm, in our time together. And, ah, I'd like you to start if you could just tell me some of your goals, if, if you have some. 

00:02:45
MEGAN In my life right now? 

00:02:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Goals in your life right now. Goals, or, you know, let's say you can make a wish. 

00:02:55
MEGAN Okay. 

00:02:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Maybe three wishes. Heck, five wishes. No, no, three wishes is enough.(Laughs) Three wishes for ways that you might change or improve yourself. 

00:03:05
MEGAN Myself. Myself as a person, or myself physically or just me? 

00:03:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Any way you wanna answer that. 

00:03:15
MEGAN Ahh. Well, my first one would probably be, I don't know, able to predict my future. 

00:03:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Okay. 

00:03:25
MEGAN You know, just see where I'll end up. 

00:03:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You'd like to know where you ended up in the future? 

00:03:25
MEGAN Yeah. I got, I got an idea. But, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:03:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:03:30
MEGAN some things happen and, (crosstalk) 

00:03:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN What's your idea? 

00:03:30
MEGAN  Make a lot of money. 

00:03:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah? 

00:03:35
MEGAN Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:03:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN (inaudible ), (crosstalk) 

00:03:36
MEGAN And to have a nice house. 

00:03:36
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You, and that's what you think is gonna happen? You're gonna make a fair amount of money... (crosstalk) 

00:03:40
MEGAN Yeah. 

00:03:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And have a decent house. 

00:03:40
MEGAN I should when I get, yeah, I should. 

00:03:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Go ahead. 

00:03:45
MEGAN Yeah. Uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:03:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That's number one. 

00:03:45
MEGAN Yeah, that's number one. My second, maybe my anger. 

00:03:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:03:55
MEGAN My anger problem. I have a little temper sometimes. 

00:03:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:03:55
MEGAN It's out of control that I, ah, I'd, you know, just people, I'd just, people would make me mad. 

00:04:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You seem so relaxed and calm now, but what you're saying is that you, that, that sometimes... (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
MEGAN Sometimes... (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN ...people would... (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
MEGAN ...not all the times. 

00:04:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Sometimes people really tick you off. 

00:04:10
MEGAN Yeah. 

00:04:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Okay. 

00:04:15
MEGAN And, ah, the third one. Maybe I'd be still outgoing all the time, I don't know. I'm really outgoing and... (crosstalk) 

00:04:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:04:25
MEGAN ...you know, I just do weird things and people just get in, intimidated by, (inaudible ) talking sometimes, so I'm really outgoing. 

00:04:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So the downside on that is you're so outgoing that sometimes it puts people off? 

00:04:40
MEGAN Yeah. 

00:04:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And that... (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
MEGAN Just like they don't wanna be around me 'cause I, you know. 

00:04:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN ...you're too outgoing. 

00:04:45
MEGAN Yeah, I'm too out, I'm too out there. You know what I mean? 

00:04:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:04:50
MEGAN Do you understand? Okay. 

00:04:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Very extroverted and very outgoing. 

00:04:50
MEGAN Yeah. 

00:04:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And some people can't handle that very well. 

00:04:55
MEGAN Yeah. And it's just how I am. I can't help it. 

00:04:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:04:55
MEGAN I mean, I don't wanna change for other people. 

00:04:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Sure. 

00:05:00
MEGAN Never gonna happen. 

00:05:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You are who you are and that's a thing that you don't really need to, or you don't think you need to really wanna change. 

00:05:05
MEGAN Uh hmm. 

00:05:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, of those three... (crosstalk) 

00:05:05
MEGAN Uh hmm. 

00:05:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Okay? As much as I'd like to say I could help you make money. 

00:05:10
MEGAN Yeah. 

00:05:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  And tell your future, and foretell your future. Maybe we'll get to that. (Laughs) 

00:05:15
MEGAN Okay. 

00:05:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But, uhm, I think the easiest one for us to focus on would be the anger. 

00:05:20
MEGAN The anger. Yeah. 

00:05:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Uhm, because here's what my goal is. My goal is to help you accomplish your goals as long as they're legal and healthy. 

00:05:30
MEGAN  Okay. (Laughs) 

00:05:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay? 

00:05:35
MEGAN All right. 

00:05:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Fair enough? 

00:05:35
MEGAN Yup. Fair. 

00:05:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  And I hear the anger one as being pretty legal and pre, well, pretty healthy. So, 

00:05:40
MEGAN  Anger management, right? 

00:05:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:05:45
MEGAN Yeah. Okay. 

00:05:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So tell me, I'm gonna, I'm gonna ask you some question about the anger stuff. When is the first time, how old were you when you felt like, "Ah, I got this temper," or somebody told you you got a temper? 

00:05:55
MEGAN  Well, uhm, I have short-term memory. So, I'm gonna try really, I'm, you know, I, sometimes I just can't remember that far. (crosstalk) 

00:06:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Just the best you can. 

00:06:05
MEGAN  It's kinda like third grade? 

00:06:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:06:10
MEGAN Oh, no. It was like, yeah, it was like third grade. I beat up my sister. 

00:06:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Older, younger sister? 

00:06:15
MEGAN Older. 

00:06:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Okay. 

00:06:20
MEGAN Okay. 

00:06:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You beat her up? 

00:06:20
MEGAN 'Cause she tried to beat me up. So, I jumped on her so many times. I felt really bad, though. Like I cried for days in my sleep, you know, 'cause I felt really bad. I keep apologizing to her and apologizing, you know, (inaudible ) come up to me, you know, few months later and (inaudible ), I'm so sorry about what happened that one time. She was like, "No, it's okay." You know, we'd just go off and like, "You know, that was dumb, but it's okay." 

00:06:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, yeah. So that's an example of pretty early? 

00:06:40
MEGAN Yeah, uhm, that I can remember. 

00:06:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN (inaudible ), (crosstalk) 

00:06:47
MEGAN But, you know, even if I had more time, I'd probably, (crosstalk) 

00:06:47
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Go back to even before? (crosstalk) 

00:06:50
MEGAN Yeah. Even before. Oh, wait. Once, when I was four, my brother and sister used to play, "keep away from Megan", and they'd run away from me and jump fences. I was four years old. I couldn't, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:07:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN They were both older than you? 

00:07:00
MEGAN Yeah. I'm the youngest. I couldn't chase after them. I couldn't jump a fence. I was four and it made me angry, you know, that one and the other one that I could think of. 

00:07:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, when you say that second one, uhm, you sounded sad. 

00:07:15
MEGAN Yeah, it made me sad, too. 

00:07:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Yeah. 

00:07:20
MEGAN I think more angry. 

00:07:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Sure. (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
MEGAN Uh-huh. I was really young, though. One of, you know, when it comes to my mind that I was very angry, 'cause it personally just because... (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You're a third grader? 

00:07:30
MEGAN Yeah. I'm in third grade. 

00:07:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Your sister was trying to beat you up? 

00:07:35
MEGAN She was trying to like, uhm, embarrass me, you know? And make me look like I was nothing 'cause she had older friends... (crosstalk) 

00:07:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:07:40
MEGAN ...or something like that. 

00:07:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:07:40
MEGAN  Like make me look stupid in front of my friends. 

00:07:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:07:45
MEGAN So it made me very (inaudible ). 

00:07:49
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Okay. 

00:07:50
MEGAN And I chased her around... (crosstalk) 

00:07:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:07:50
MEGAN ...you know, the schoolyard and cornered her and started jumping on her stomach. There was like, "Ha, ha, ha", they'll go on, like cheering me on and doing and sat at the corner of the school and, yeah, I got in trouble. 

00:08:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:08:05
MEGAN Yeah, I still think about that. 

00:08:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  And so, so first, the other one, when you were four kinda make you sad and mad? 

00:08:15
MEGAN Yeah. 

00:08:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And the second one, uhm, sounds like you're maybe embarrassed in that. 

00:08:15
MEGAN  Yeah. I was embarrassed of what I did. (crosstalk) 

00:08:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:08:20
MEGAN That's the word, yeah. That's exactly how I felt because I didn't, you know, want people to think, you know, that's me and my sister, so I kind of do. 

00:08:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But you were embarrassed though she tried to embarrass you... (crosstalk) 

00:08:30
MEGAN Yeah. 

00:08:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN ...was what I was saying, so embarrassed and then mad and then embarrassed. 

00:08:35
MEGAN And then embarrassed that I did it. 

00:08:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN (Laughs) Right. 

00:08:35
MEGAN So it's feeling two, you know, types of, you know, embarrassment... (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Embarrassed now on both ends... (crosstalk) 

00:08:40
MEGAN ...yeah. 

00:08:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN ...of the mad. 

00:08:40
MEGAN Uh hmm. 

00:08:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Okay. 

00:08:45
MEGAN I didn't love her very well. 

00:08:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Now, Rita, you suggested before watching this clip that viewers put themselves in my shoes and see how that, how they imagine feeling? 

00:08:55
DR. RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. I definitely noticed even just watching the videotape, I felt agitated myself. And some need to exercise control or get her to relax or speed up myself. It definitely had an effect on my sense of working with her. 

00:09:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And my impression is that oftentimes teenagers, with their different energy levels and attitudes have a strong effect on the counselor. 

00:09:20
DR. RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:09:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so this is the time when you could pause the tape for some discussion if you would like. Next clip, I'm counseling a boy named Shawn who has actually asked to come talk with me because he's angry all the time. And you've seen the clip. 

00:09:40
DR. RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:09:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, do you have anything you think we should watch for? 

00:09:40
DR. RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, there are actually several things. First, of course, there is not the same introduction because the therapy issues sort of been identified. Next, I think it will be interesting for you as viewers to look at John's use of a very early interpretation or a case formulation. Uhm, you'll notice that it comes very early and is fairly definitive. And, finally, you might wanna watch for John's work with, uhm, that kind of role reversal work to increase his apathy. 

00:10:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  So, I don't know you, you don't know me. Basically, we're kind of strangers. So, uhm, I, you know, I have different ways of trying to get to know people. One is just to ask you some things about what you like and what you don't like. 

00:10:35
SHAWN All right. 

00:10:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay? So I, I'll just do that if that's okay. 

00:10:40
SHAWN All right. No worries. 

00:10:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So, I'm gonna sometimes write things down, uhm, not always, but write a few things down. So, tell me, uhm, what's your favorite thing to do, favorite recreational activity? 

00:10:55
SHAWN Uhm, there is a couple of things. I like playing football. 

00:10:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:10:55
SHAWN  Like playing basketball. 

00:11:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:11:00
SHAWN Uhm, I like to draw and write music. 

00:11:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Write music, not lyrics. 

00:11:10
SHAWN Uhm, lyrics. (crosstalk) 

00:11:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Or both. Oh, write, write lyrics, okay. 

00:11:10
SHAWN  And that's about it. (Laughs) 

00:11:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So those are the things you really like. 

00:11:20
SHAWN Uh hmm. 

00:11:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Enjoy a lot. How about some things you hate? Sometimes you can tell a lot about somebody by finding out things that just make you (inaudible ). 

00:11:29
SHAWN  The same things. (Laughs) 

00:11:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You hate football, you hate basketball, and you hate drawing? 

00:11:35
SHAWN Ah, I, I, these are my favorite, these are my favorite things to do but they make me mad. 

00:11:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:11:35
SHAWN  'Cause I get frustrated when I, like when I play basketball, if I don't play so well it'll make me mad. 

00:11:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:11:45
SHAWN If I don't, you know, I like QB when I play football. If I don't get a good pass or somebody drops it, I get mad. 

00:11:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:11:50
SHAWN Uhm, when I draw, if I can't think enough in the drawing and I mess up, I get mad. 

00:11:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:11:55
SHAWN Or, uhm, when I write music, if I can't think of anything and I get writer's block I get really mad. 

00:12:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Yeah. 

00:12:05
SHAWN So, yeah. And they're, they're like my worst things to do. Like, when somebody wouldn't want me to do, but they're my favorite things to do so I do them anyways. (Laughs) 

00:12:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Uh-huh, that's interesting. So, I can tell you what the issues are already. 

00:12:15
SHAWN  All right. 

00:12:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You're ready? 

00:12:20
SHAWN Yeah. 

00:12:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, you know what the problem is about the, about anger for you? 

00:12:25
SHAWN Hmm. 

00:12:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You're a perfectionist. 

00:12:25
SHAWN I try to be. I don't really mean to be, though. I don't like to be... (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:12:30
SHAWN ...because if I don't play as good as I wanna play in basketball, for example, for missing a shot when I know I can make it, I know I should make it, it makes me mad. I mean, really mad... (crosstalk) 

00:12:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:12:40
SHAWN ...I mean, I would just be like, all right, don't worry, you know, I'm, I'm really mad now. It's like I flip out. 

00:12:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You think you should do things right all the time. 

00:12:50
SHAWN Yeah, uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:12:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. That's tough. Man, you got a huge burden. 

00:12:55
SHAWN I don't, I don't mean to. Didn't mean to... (crosstalk) 

00:12:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That's a lot of pressure. 

00:12:55
SHAWN ...trying to, it's, it's (inaudible ) it's a lot of stress 'cause, you know, this is kinda the way that I was brought up. You know, I never wanted to lose at anything. I never wanted to be less of, less than anybody. I've always wanted to be the best but... (crosstalk) 

00:13:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:13:15
SHAWN ...I've never done that yet. 

00:13:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  When you say the way you were brought up, what kinds of things did you learn growing up? 

00:13:20
SHAWN Uhm, that, you know, if I didn't do good or were not, that I would get picked on for it. 

00:13:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Uh hmm. 

00:13:30
SHAWN Or beat on for it by, by peers, by you know, classmates or whatever. 

00:13:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Not by parents. 

00:13:35
SHAWN  No. Never. But I've, you know it just kind of (inaudible ) from elementary school 'cause if I didn't do anything right I always get picked on or beat up for it. 

00:13:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:13:50
SHAWN Or, you know, I, I used to dress like dorky. I never liked, 'cause I used to dress like a dork wearing tight jeans and everything when I was little that like I get beat up everyday so I finally realized maybe I'll wear some baggy clothes, you know, maybe they'll stop beating me up. They didn't stop beating me up but didn't beat me up as bad. 

00:14:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, it worked a little bit. 

00:14:05
SHAWN  Yeah. I mean, maybe they still beat me up everyday but maybe every other day like, draw me like one every time (inaudible ). (Laughs) Then I, before I talk funny too. I, I talk different than they did. 

00:14:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah? 

00:14:20
SHAWN They beat me up for that, so. 

00:14:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  And so, you got picked on a lot. 

00:14:25
SHAWN Yeah. That's got a lot to do with my anger. 

00:14:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Yeah. 

00:14:30
SHAWN Why? 

00:14:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, why? 

00:14:30
SHAWN 'Cause I was small and they could. 

00:14:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  So it starts off. It's kinda weird. It starts off with you picking on yourself. It's like, well, wait a minute, uhm, Shawn, everybody misses. You know that. 

00:14:45
SHAWN Yeah. It is this kind of a, it's different in a way, it's like I don't want them, I don't wanna miss ever. And I wanna be the best player always no matter who I'm playing with. And I don't like to get beaten. I don't like to do anything is wrong. 

00:15:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:15:00
SHAWN 'Cause if I do it then, it just shows that I'm, I'm weak. 

00:15:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay, so the last time you played basketball, on a scale of 0 to 100, what percent of competence, of skill would you give yourself? 

00:15:15
SHAWN  Uhm, I think I'll be estimating a little bit, uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:15:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN A 100 percent would be a perfect day. 

00:15:25
SHAWN ...not nope. 

00:15:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:15:25
SHAWN Huh. 

00:15:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Zero would be a total flunk, right? 

00:15:25
SHAWN Well, I play about, 50 percent. 

00:15:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You give yourself 50 percent? Okay. So, 50 percent and, uhm, okay, hmm, have you ever gotten a 100? 

00:15:45
SHAWN Couple of times. 

00:15:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  So you have a couple of 100s. Okay. When you get a 100 percent, now we're going to use a grade, we're using a grading system, okay? Would you give yourself an A? 

00:16:00
SHAWN  Uhm, for totally overall like ah, every year? 

00:16:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN No, just one, the one time, the one or the two times when you've played and you think you did a 100 percent perfect. Would you give yourself an A? 

00:16:15
SHAWN No. 

00:16:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You wouldn't give yourself an A? 

00:16:15
SHAWN No. 

00:16:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Why not? A 100 percent. You couldn't do any better. 

00:16:20
SHAWN Ah, I could do better. I could always do better. No. 

00:16:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  So you would never give yourself a 100 percent? 

00:16:25
SHAWN Uhm, no, I'd give myself a 100 but then, you know, I, you can grade higher than a 100 percent. 

00:16:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But you wouldn't give yourself an A? 

00:16:30
SHAWN Uh umm. 

00:16:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Oh. 

00:16:35
SHAWN Just because I, I wouldn't give anybody 100 percent, anybody except for a couple of people in the NBA an A if you were grading them (inaudible ) ability. 

00:16:46
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:16:46
SHAWN Just because it's, it's so hard or now, you can make every shot, but you can't play your best. Your best is, you know, never getting touched, never getting the ball stolen, never getting stopped, you know, dunking and everything. That means you got to be able to do it all perfectly. 

00:17:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Yeah. Have you done it? (crosstalk) 

00:17:05
SHAWN I mean a 100, no, I can just rim but I can't dunk. (Laughs) 

00:17:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:17:10
SHAWN Uhm, you know what I mean but you, it's, you gotta be out gets passed and be perfect, without making a single mistake. 

00:17:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:17:20
SHAWN Ain't nobody do that. 

00:17:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:17:20
SHAWN And that's more than a 100 percent. 

00:17:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Nobody could do that. 

00:17:20
SHAWN  No, that's, some people can, I mean, but it's like, you can't, it's, I don't know, it's hard. 

00:17:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  So, that's a lot of pressure to never ever be able to really think that you got an A, playing basketball or football, probably. I mean, your drawing, it's similar, it's, it's never quite perfect. 

00:17:45
SHAWN No. I wish it was. (Laughs) 

00:17:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, well, well, my, one of my goals here is to help you deal with anger, right? I think the anger's about your perfectionism and that you can just never do well enough and so you're pissed off. Now, I'm not quite sure why you're so perfectionistic(ph), why it matters so much to you. But that in your mind, I think, is, is kind of what is so, it becomes so important to be perfect that when you're not, you're pissed at yourself and take it out at other people. You with me? 

00:18:30
SHAWN Yeah. 

00:18:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, so I'm thinking it's the perfectionism, but now I'm just kinda, I'm trying to think that maybe, maybe you could pretend that you're the counselor, okay? And I'm coming in to see you. And I'm a perfectionist. I'm never happy with my performance. I get pissed. You're in Dorm 1 so you didn't hear when my wife told the story about... (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
SHAWN Hmm. 

00:19:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN ...me playing basketball. I think she told that to (inaudible ) too. And that things weren't going well, and so, uhm, I kicked the ball across the gym and the ref, of course. Of course, I, I did that after I told the ref that I thought maybe he was doing some things wrong. Then I kicked the ball across the gym and, ah, then he kicked me out of the gym. He'd already kicked me out of the game, then out of the gym, and, uhm, so the ball was actually mine so I took it and left. It was terribly embarrassing. It was a terrible story, okay? So, I need your help. I need your help because when things don't go right, when I don't score 30, when I don't do things perfectly, I go berserk. How can you help me with this perfectionism problem? 

00:20:00
SHAWN I don't know. 

00:20:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Give me some advice, give me some advice. 

00:20:05
SHAWN Why do you get, why do you get, why do you get mad? 

00:20:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I get mad because I could do better. I know I could do better. (laughs) It's bullshit for me to play the way I play. I can do better. I should win every game. 

00:20:20
SHAWN (sigh) Let me think for a second, I'm not a psychologist. (crosstalk) 

00:20:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes, that's fine. Being a psychologist, you think, you got to think. 

00:20:30
SHAWN  Uhm. 

00:20:40
[sil.] 

00:20:40
SHAWN  Hmm-mm. Okay well, I couldn't say that, you know, don't think about it, don't think that it's just a game. But it's also hard, it's hard to think like that. 

00:21:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, you would tell me just think it's a, just think it's just a game? 

00:21:00
SHAWN Yeah. The, the you know it's just a game. You know there's no reason to get mad because not everybody is perfect. 

00:21:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:21:05
SHAWN  But, you know, you probably, is, but, you know, if you were me, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:21:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN No, that's okay, you can go on with your sentence. So you're telling me, you're telling me that I need to think different. Is that what you're telling me? 

00:21:20
SHAWN Well, not think different, but like, uhm, oh, I'm trying to think about how to say this. Think outside being perfect. Not being different, you know, think the same, but think, think as if that, you know, it doesn't matter. 

00:21:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  So I need to practice thinking that it doesn't matter? 

00:21:40
SHAWN  Yeah. 

00:21:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But it does. 

00:21:45
SHAWN Right. (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It matters to me, so I need to practice thinking different, 'cause it matters to me now. And I think about how much it matters. So what you're saying is that I need to think about it, it doesn't matter. Let it go. (crosstalk) 

00:21:55
SHAWN Yeah, but it doesn't matter. 

00:21:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN To me. 

00:21:55
SHAWN  Yeah. 

00:22:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, but your point is, " Change that way of thinking, John, and you'll feel better." Is that what you're saying? 

00:22:10
SHAWN Uhm, yeah. 

00:22:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay, okay. 

00:22:10
SHAWN  No, that's, (crosstalk) 

00:22:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN What if I can't? 

00:22:15
SHAWN it's, ah, it's hard. 

00:22:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It's hard. So, (crosstalk) 

00:22:15
SHAWN  No. 

00:22:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN how do I do it? How do I, how do I change the way I'm thinking? 

00:22:25
SHAWN play (inaudible ). 

00:22:26
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. (Laughs) 

00:22:26
SHAWN (Laughs) Uhm. (Laughs) 

00:22:26
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Okay, I'll try. Then I'll fail, and then I'll be even more pissed. 

00:22:30
SHAWN  Oh. (crosstalk) 

00:22:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN 'Coz now my psychologist told me to play better. (laughs) 

00:22:35
SHAWN (laughs) Uhm. That was a joke.(crosstalk) 

00:22:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Oh, I know it. It's okay. 

00:22:40
SHAWN (laughs) Well, you know, what I'm trying to do, you can do what I'm trying to do. Don't play for a little while, you know, I mean, when I play, like, I'll stop playing. When I play again I'm always a little better. But then you can try not playing. 

00:23:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Take some time off. 

00:23:00
SHAWN Take, or, you know, get some new hobby. (laughs) 

00:23:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  (laughs) Some non-competitive hobbies. (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
SHAWN Yeah. 

00:23:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, drawing and writing music, ah, ah, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
SHAWN Yeah, but. 

00:23:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN that's not competitive. 

00:23:10
SHAWN Well, then. (crosstalk) 

00:23:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  I still get pissed about that. 

00:23:15
SHAWN  Oh, well. 

00:23:20
[sil.] 

00:23:20
SHAWN  Quit smoking. (laughs) Maybe that'll help. (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You think smoking, you think smoking is making me more uptight? 

00:23:30
SHAWN  Maybe. 

00:23:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It's could be. Nicotine can do that. 

00:23:35
SHAWN Yeah, yeah. It does. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It's a stimulant. 

00:23:40
SHAWN Oh, great. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Do you smoke? 

00:23:40
SHAWN  Yeah. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:23:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But you should quit, right? 

00:23:45
SHAWN Yeah. 

00:23:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Because if you were perfect, you could quit. 

00:23:50
SHAWN I'm working on it. It's hard to quit. I'm not mad at that 'coz. (crosstalk) 

00:23:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  It's hard. 

00:23:55
SHAWN That, that's really hard especially (inaudible ) it's almost (inaudible ) still smoke everyday. (crosstalk) 

00:24:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN (inaudible ) 

00:24:02
SHAWN Uhm. 

00:24:02
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Couldn't have your basketball any? 

00:24:02
SHAWN  No. But I have been smoking and playing for so long that it doesn't. (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It doesn't. (crosstalk) 

00:24:05
SHAWN To me, it doesn't affect me. (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:24:10
SHAWN I mean, I, I know I could play so much better and run so much faster, and jump so much higher because I now have the, ah, more stamina, and I wouldn't get tired so easy if I quit. It's just so hard to quit smoking. 

00:24:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It's a drug. 

00:24:20
SHAWN  I hate it, but I like, but I hate. Yeah, it's, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:24:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, let me ask you this, though, I may be the psychologist again. 

00:24:30
SHAWN  Thank you. 

00:24:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You did a good job. 

00:24:35
SHAWN Not really. 

00:24:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Oh, come on. You, you've never been a psychologist before. 

00:24:40
SHAWN No, but. (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You came up with one good idea. 

00:24:40
SHAWN  What was that? 

00:24:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Change the way I'm thinking. 

00:24:45
SHAWN Yeah, but it's hard to change the way you think, it's so hard 'coz it's stuck there. (crosstalk) 

00:24:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But you know, you were, you, you're absolutely right on in terms of what's one of the main ways that psychologist teach people to not be so pissed off, is to change the way they're thinking. (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
SHAWN Uh hmm but that. (crosstalk) 

00:25:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And that it's really hard. 

00:25:05
SHAWN And it really takes time. 

00:25:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It takes time (inaudible ). 

00:25:07
SHAWN And I've been, I've been working on it for two and a half years. (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:25:10
SHAWN Try to calm myself down and calm my anger down. 

00:25:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:25:10
SHAWN  And, you, know, I'm getting there, yeah, but it has, ah, taking a lot of time for it to do that. (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:25:20
SHAWN 'Coz when I first, when I first moved to Montana with my mom, I was at this bar and playing a pool. I was listening to some music, some rap. (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:25:25
SHAWN And this guy made a really racist comment. I didn't appreciate it when I told him to (inaudible ). 

00:25:33
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:25:33
SHAWN  And his friend got up and I (inaudible ) his friend, too. And, you know, they sat down and my mom turned her back to the back 'coz she was, you know, I'm half-Black. So, I didn't appreciate it at all. (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:25:45
SHAWN Especially if they're coming from where I'm from, you know, from a little, you know, hate town like that. And, you know, I'm, well, I'm not used to it. And I don't like people making racist comments. And mom took me to the back and tried, you know, telling me that, you know these guys are different than, this is a different place from where you grew up. I said, I don't care. You know, you don't say something like that and expect me not to do nothing back because that offends me and that should offend you, too, 'coz I'm your son. 

00:26:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:26:15
SHAWN Then she kind of, then she kind of, you know, realize that it was kind of not. And she said, well, just calm down (inaudible ) you can't talk about (inaudible ) I was like, ah, whatever. So, that's why, you know, I didn't talk to that guy. (crosstalk) 

00:26:26
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
SHAWN And, you know, from then to now, I'll calm down a lot. I don't get mad at just, you know, at the same things I used to. Ah, I do, but I don't flip out as bad as I did. (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:26:40
SHAWN Sometimes I do, but sometimes I don't. (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:26:40
SHAWN And it just takes a lot of time... (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:26:45
SHAWN ...for me to. (crosstalk) 

00:26:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Work on it (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:26:48
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, John, I have to say, that that early interpretation is something I struggled with. It's not something I could personally use myself. Ah, but I, I can see how it works for you, although (inaudible ) is the concern is that, if you've used it with a client who you didn't have the strength to react or resist, it could be, kind of, all about you. 

00:27:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. You know, I think there is a risk in that and what I found is that sometimes when I have this kind of intuitive insight about a young person with whom I'm working, it just almost bubbles up in me. And if I can manage to say it in a way that gives them permission to disagree, that, uhm, conveys that I'm kind of really trying to work with them and their inner world, that sometimes there's this intimate moment and we go deeper. (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:27:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And they just feel very understood and we go deeper. (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Yeah. 

00:27:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And, ah, it allows us to have a better chance of some positive work as we go on. 

00:27:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. I can, I can see that working. And I think the other thing that's true of your work with kids, uhm, very consistently is that you make sure they understand it's okay to disagree with you, to offer an alternative. And the nice things about that technique is, with teens, they can hardly resist one way or the other. They'll either really agree with you and to sort of be a guru or they'll really disagree with you, but it's hard for them not to react, so it has some engagement quality. (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It does often hook them. (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It hooks, yeah. 

00:28:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And, and then the other time when I think it's really good to use this, uhm, but I, I think it can be overused, is when you're doing very brief therapy. (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Oh, yeah. 

00:28:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Single session, (crosstalk) 

00:28:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:28:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN very short-term therapy, because, uhm, conceptualizing or formulating the case early helps you work together a little more quickly. 

00:28:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right, which puts a lot of pressure on you as the counselor. So, this might be another time to pause the tape and think about how you feel about being forced to formulate that early. 

00:28:50
[sil.] 

00:28:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Okay, in this next session, John is working with a young man, who is, ah, both African-American and Puerto Rican descent. And, probably, one of the more interesting things to watch is John's attempt to acknowledge the differences between them and get that to work. 

00:29:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I do think the multi-cultural dynamics are interesting here, but I have to say the part of the tape that I like the best is when I spontaneously share an image that came into my mind during the session. And you can watch for that, as well. 

00:29:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, it's okay if I call you Michael? 

00:29:30
MICHAEL Yeah, it's okay. 

00:29:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Good. Uhm, you know, we know each other a little bit. (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
MICHAEL Uh hmm. 

00:29:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But not a lot and, uhm, this is your time, you can talk about whatever you want. (crosstalk) 

00:29:40
MICHAEL Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN If there's some ways that, uhm, I can be helpful to you here, in the future, ah, I'd like to be. but one thing that came to mind for me, and I thought maybe we'd start with this is that, uhm, you know, I'm not, ah, I was never in gang, okay? I'm not African-American, okay? I don't know kinda, I can try to relate to where you've been and things you've experienced, but I don't know much about it and so I don't know if you'd feel comfortable telling me some stuff. 

00:30:10
MICHAEL  All right, I'll start with anything. (laughs) 

00:30:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN What? 

00:30:15
MICHAEL I start it. 

00:30:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:30:15
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:30:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  So, what kind of stuff are you (inaudible ) gone through, the kind of things that you've experienced. 

00:30:22
MICHAEL  Oh, where do I start, whew, well, first of all, when I, when I first joined the gang, you know, things then, you know, just all of a sudden, it just got wild. (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:30:40
MICHAEL It kinda took a while. (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:30:40
MICHAEL  About months went past, whatever, uhm, but one, you know, at that time did come, I was, gettin' jumped and gettin' stabbed and shot. 

00:30:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You were kind of drifting that way? War-gang stuff? 

00:31:00
MICHAEL Not really that. It's just that, you know, being an out-of-towner, you know, nobody really noticed you, and people, you know, well, when I'm (inaudible ) I used to just, you know, look familiar, and you weren't welcome basically. 

00:31:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay, so you're kind of ah, a new guy? (crosstalk) 

00:31:20
MICHAEL  Yeah. 

00:31:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And they, so they used you as a target? Yeah(ph). (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
MICHAEL Not so much as the target but, you know, as much as my parents, you know, and... (crosstalk) 

00:31:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Okay. 

00:31:35
MICHAEL ...go from the hair to the clothes, shoes, you know, kind of stereotyped me before I've even gotten to the gang life. 

00:31:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Okay. So you dressed in town and look in town like maybe you're in a gang. (crosstalk) 

00:31:45
MICHAEL  Yeah. 

00:31:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And soon you got treated like that. 

00:31:50
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:31:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Yeah. So then, you got in and you said that you were, uhm, I thought you said you were a Crips, is that it? 

00:32:00
MICHAEL  (laughs) Yeah. 

00:32:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN No. What? 

00:32:05
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:32:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. You didn't know which one? You're wearing red, I should have known. So, how did that happen? How do you pick? What's the. (crosstalk) 

00:32:15
MICHAEL Uhm, it wasn't, it's not really, it wasn't really hard for me because, you know, my mom's side of family, there's, there's the Crip gangs stuff. (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:32:25
MICHAEL  Lots of my family is, it's what they do. On my dad's side of the family, well, Latin gang called Latin Kings, (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
MICHAEL you know, they're not really, they're not Crips or Bloods, they're just a gang. Pretty thing. (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:32:40
MICHAEL A gang. Ah, but, as far as my choosin', I, ah, it was, the neighborhood I lived in it was all Crip neighborhood and walk down the streets to go play basketball or go to school or go to the store some, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:33:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:33:05
MICHAEL I, matter of fact, I remember the first time that I got beat up for wearing red was when I'm like my second month in Colorado, I had a Miami Heat jersey on and got beat up... (crosstalk) 

00:33:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:33:20
MICHAEL ...and then, you know, one day I just decided, well, hey, you know, I got a friend out here, you know, he's, he's in the gang business, you know. I'm tired of getting jumped and so, why not? 

00:33:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN The benefits being. (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
MICHAEL Benefits being that the jumping will slow down, you know, it decrease a little bit. Uhm, ah, watch their back like they watch mine's, you know. 

00:33:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:33:50
MICHAEL Sort of like a, like my brothers, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Sure. 

00:33:55
MICHAEL And speaking of my brother, ah, was also, he's also in a gang. (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Yeah. 

00:34:05
MICHAEL Yeah, but different side. 

00:34:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:34:05
MICHAEL  Yeah. 

00:34:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, I think I remember your saying that you and he had gotten into a pretty serious, ah, fight with weapons. 

00:34:20
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:34:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But haven't since. 

00:34:20
MICHAEL  Uh-huh. 

00:34:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That somehow got a truce going? 

00:34:25
MICHAEL  Not so much a truce just, you know, after our, that happened, there is just like, well, you know, it's cool to fight and, you know, Sam, but we're family, ain't gotta kill, you know, Sam, my own brother or his own brother over, you know, some colors, you know, that, when you look at it, or when you really look at it, it really doesn't, you know, mean nothing. (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:34:55
MICHAEL It'd really be a stupid reason to kill a family member, you know. 

00:35:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So, sometimes like you, uhm, step back. Somehow, you managed to step back and say, that'd be a stupid reason. 

00:35:10
MICHAEL Nah. Actually, there was kind of ah, me swinging it at me and, and dodgin' it. (crosstalk) 

00:35:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah? 

00:35:20
MICHAEL Something, yeah. 

00:35:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And then, you guys realized. (crosstalk) 

00:35:25
MICHAEL Nah, and then, it kind of fell out of my hands, you know, we just use our hands, feet. 

00:35:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. And after that, when you decided. (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
MICHAEL Yeah, after that. 

00:35:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Let's not use weapons with each other? 

00:35:35
MICHAEL  Nah. It was, it was (inaudible ) decision but, you know, it didn't really come out like that. (crosstalk) 

00:35:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:35:45
MICHAEL It was just, just ceased and then, ah, the other fights were down too, after that incident, there was, just never used weapons. 

00:35:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. I really appreciate you know because I, I'm trying to, try to understand you know. (crosstalk) 

00:36:00
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:36:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so I'll take a guess, and I'm usually wrong, and you just correct me. I appreciate that. (crosstalk) 

00:36:05
MICHAEL All right. 

00:36:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN No, it wasn't quite like that. It was a little different, so. Uhm, we talked some about, ah, what got you into gang stuff. (crosstalk) 

00:36:10
MICHAEL  Uh hmm. 

00:36:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And, uhm, and then what kinda got you out of it. Even though you're not totally officially out. (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
MICHAEL Right. 

00:36:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But out of active. 

00:36:25
MICHAEL Ah, yeah, activities. 

00:36:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, out of the activities. (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
MICHAEL Okay. 

00:36:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  And, and here's what I heard. I heard you say, what kinda got you in was, of course, being where you were, the neighborhood, dressing, a little bit gang street, okay. (laughs) 

00:36:40
MICHAEL  Yeah. (laughs) 

00:36:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And, I mean, in some ways, you kinda made your recipe for what you're doing now, I guess would be, it seemed like the recipe for getting out of that would be getting out of the neighborhood. 

00:37:00
MICHAEL Yeah, but then, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And changing the way you dress. 

00:37:00
MICHAEL  Oh, that's never gonna change. 

00:37:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. (laughs) 

00:37:05
MICHAEL (laughs) But as far as the. (crosstalk) 

00:37:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Some things can change and some things can't. 

00:37:10
MICHAEL Yeah, as far as the neighborhood go, it is just, it, well, it didn't matter what neighborhood I was gonna live in, it was gonna be there, you know, because you have so many different, ah, types of hoods out there. (crosstalk) 

00:37:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:37:25
MICHAEL But as far as, you know, get myself, you know, temporarily away from all that. (crosstalk) 

00:37:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:37:30
MICHAEL It's just the fact of me just gettin' out of the state, you know, go out to a state where, you know, I could be focused and all that, the way about none of that, you know, that where they don't have gangs out there, you know. 

00:37:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:37:45
MICHAEL  It's just, yeah, just basically, just getting somewhere where there's no gangs and I could be focused, you know, and don't worry about how much longer I'm gonna live or, and all these other good stuff, (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:38:00
MICHAEL you know. And it's actually pretty different. 

00:38:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, ah, you've made a good pick. 

00:38:10
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:38:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN (laughs) You think? 

00:38:10
MICHAEL Yeah. (laughs) 

00:38:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  So, I, I just had this funny image coming into my mind and I'm just gonna tell what it was, okay? I just had this, this really funny thought that what if you were dressed like me? (laughs) You can't even imagine it, can you? 

00:38:30
MICHAEL No. 

00:38:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I just thought to myself, what if we just like switched? 

00:38:35
MICHAEL Actually, you'd look pretty cool with this on. (crosstalk) 

00:38:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I would. I would really look good with that. (crosstalk) 

00:38:40
MICHAEL You'd look better. 

00:38:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You say, you wouldn't look so good with this. 

00:38:40
MICHAEL No. 

00:38:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Have you ever dressed like this? 

00:38:45
MICHAEL No. 

00:38:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN How do you know you wouldn't look cool then? 

00:38:45
MICHAEL Because that's not my style. 

00:38:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah? 

00:38:50
MICHAEL No. That's not my style. 

00:38:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN No. I am, I'm not saying it should be. (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:38:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I'm just. (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
MICHAEL Yeah, I understand that. (crosstalk) 

00:38:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But you can, you can understand why I had that thought, though, right? 

00:38:55
MICHAEL  So? 

00:39:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN 'Coz we dress really different. 

00:39:00
MICHAEL Oh, yeah. 

00:39:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well. 

00:39:00
MICHAEL  I see. 

00:39:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. (laughs) I thought, well, what if we, ah, I just had this image of you dressed like me. I thought it'd be pretty funny. 

00:39:10
MICHAEL  Yeah. 

00:39:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, here's what I, here's what I've learned okay? I've learned that you and I, we don't dress alike, okay. You've got a different style. I love the word you said, style. You have a different style. Uhm, and I might learn from that, maybe. Okay? But... (crosstalk) 

00:39:40
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:39:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN ...I think in some way that we think alike. Okay? And that you, actually, and I can understand each other more kinda on that thinking level, even though we're a lot different. And one of the things I, I just learned about you was that, is that, you're a really good thinker. I mean, you can kinda think your way through things if you're calm and cool. 

00:40:00
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:40:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Okay. 

00:40:05
MICHAEL Okay. 

00:40:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so, what my message to you would be the last thing and the main thing would be, you got too good a brain. Your brain is too good to not use it. You know. So you oughta use it as much as you can, whenever you can, 'coz it's just too good to waste. So, let's just do a couple of minutes to what we call a debriefing. Okay, that's just when you tell me, what, what're you gonna remember of our time together? What was helpful? What did I say or do that was not so helpful? 

00:40:45
MICHAEL Uhm. What I learned from our (inaudible ) first little session was, you know, that, first, ah, you don't take mistake I (inaudible ). You don't take, you know, stupid shit so, so hard, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:41:05
MICHAEL I don't stoop to nobody else's level, you know, don't, you know, just basically think before I do everything, you know. And before I say something, uhm, have more confidence in myself which I could believe I can do, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:41:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Yeah, we got to be (inaudible ). 

00:41:36
MICHAEL Yeah. 

00:41:36
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Okay. Anything that was less helpful or you didn't mind at all? Or you wished you haven't learned? (laughs) 

00:41:45
MICHAEL No. 

00:41:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Never believe you're stupid. Okay. I'm just, I'm just telling you that. I'm a psychologist. I'm the boss. There are a lot of things I don't know, but one thing I do know is you're not stupid. 

00:42:05
MICHAEL Thank you. 

00:42:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, you're welcome. 

00:42:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  So, John, I know you really like that part about the shared image but, do you think, there's some risk associated with that? 

00:42:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  You know, I, I always think there's some risks, especially if we are spontaneous and talk about something that kinda came into our mind all of a sudden. (crosstalk) 

00:42:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:42:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But I also think, if that is tempered with what Rogers would called, the right therapeutic attitude... (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:42:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN ...of the core conditions, of unconditional positive regard, of accurate empathy, and in this case in particular, of genuineness, then, that sharing of the image can be, in kind of a mutual experience that you can enjoy together, and again might be an intimate moment that takes the counseling a little bit deeper. 

00:42:50
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. Yeah. I don't think spontaneity equals authenticity but, sometimes, the other thing that I noticed in this tape, that might be a great thing for viewers to discuss, is my sense that Michael is actually more connected to you on a gender level, ah, that that overrides the fact that you are not, uhm, sharing a cultural background with him. And as female, I, my gut, feeling was even if I were an African-American-Puerto Rican female, would have a more difficult time making the connection than you did. 

00:43:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. This might be a situation, where the gender matching... (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:43:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN ...is maybe more powerful or a better facilitator of counseling than, ah, racial or ethnic matching. 

00:43:40
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So that might be something for you to pause and discuss because it's certainly a difficult multi-cultural issue to sort out sometimes. 

00:43:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  This next segment shows John working with the girl who describes herself, as many teenage girls do, as bitchy. You won't see that particular description in the segment, but it's obviously an area of concern for her. 

00:44:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  And I have seen her, ah, couple of times before this taped session. And I know one of the issues for her is self-esteem. And so I worked with her using a formula-self-esteem activity called what's-good-about-you and her response I think is very interesting. (crosstalk) 

00:44:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I'm gonna do a little game thing with you. 

00:44:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:44:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And this is kinda silly, and uhm, it's gonna feel odd but I'm gonna do it anyway. (crosstalk) 

00:44:30
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:44:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And, uhm, I'm gonna ask you the same question ten times. Okay? It's the same question, and the way the game works is that, the rule is you have to give me a different answer each time. In other words, you can't give the same answer twice. 

00:44:45
UNKNOWN  Okay. 

00:44:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. You're ready? 

00:44:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:44:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN All right. So, do you want to know the question? 

00:44:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:44:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. I'm gonna, and I'm gonna write it down. I, I'll write down your answers. 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:45:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. The question is, what's good about me? 

00:45:05
UNKNOWN  My intelligence. 

00:45:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. My intelligence. I'm gonna spell it (inaudible ). (laughs) She's, she's gonna drip(ph), you're ready? So, thank you. What's good about you? 

00:45:25
[sil.] 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN  Uhm. I don't know, I can't think of anything (laughs). When I'm in a good mood, my attitude. 

00:45:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Okay. When I'm in a good mood, my attitude. Okay. Thank you. What's good about you? 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN  My friendship. 

00:46:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  My friendship. Okay. Great. Thank you. What's good about you? 

00:46:15
[sil.] 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN  I can't think of anything. 

00:46:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You can use that once. 'Coz you can't give me the same answer twice, and so I'll write it down. I can't think of anything. It's number four, so I have just six more. Ready? What's good about you? 

00:46:45
[sil.] 

00:46:45
UNKNOWN  My trust. 

00:46:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  My trust. Thank you. What's good about you? 

00:47:05
[sil.] 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN  My ability to be a friend and... (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
[sil.] 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN  I think just to be a friend. 

00:47:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN My ability to be a friend. Okay. Thank you. What's good about you? 

00:47:30
[sil.] 

00:47:30
UNKNOWN  It's getting harder and harder. (chuckles) Uhm. 

00:47:50
[sil.] 

00:47:50
UNKNOWN  I can't think of anything. (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:48:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Then, so you've got to say something? 

00:48:15
UNKNOWN (laughs) I can't use that one. (crosstalk) 

00:48:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Sorry(ph). You can't use that one again. Sometimes, you will feel like, you know, it's like you're getting to the bottom of the barrel, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:48:20
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:48:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN and you can't find anything in there? So, I wanna give you a little more time, but if, if you can't, I will fill in the rest for you. I'll tell you good things about yourself. 

00:48:30
UNKNOWN  My love for my family is one. It could be one. 

00:48:40
[sil.] 

00:48:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Great. Thank you. What's good about you? 

00:48:45
UNKNOWN (sighs) Uhm, that I have plans to make something in myself. 

00:48:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I have plans to make something of myself. Thank you. What's good about you? 

00:49:10
UNKNOWN My ideas to help my sister get through it without having to go through what I've gone through. 

00:49:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. My ideas to help my sister. Okay, get through it? 

00:49:25
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:49:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Without having to go through what I went through. 

00:49:30
[sil.] 

00:49:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Okay. Thank you. What's good about you? 

00:49:40
[sil.] 

00:49:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Last(ph) one. 

00:49:50
UNKNOWN I know. Uhm. 

00:49:55
[sil.] 

00:49:55
UNKNOWN  Maybe helping my mom out when she is older. 

00:50:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:50:05
UNKNOWN 'Coz she's had it pretty hard with two teenage daughters. 

00:50:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It has made her age a little bit? 

00:50:10
UNKNOWN  Especially me. Yeah. (laughs) 

00:50:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Okay, so helping my mom out when she gets older? 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:50:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You did it. You got to ten. So, can I add a couple? 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN  Sure. 

00:50:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. I would add, I mean, just at least two more things came to mind immediately for me. One of them is your courage. Do you think of yourself as a courageous person? 

00:50:40
UNKNOWN  Not really, no. 

00:50:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN No? I mean, it takes courage to do this. I think it takes courage to even come and talk to a counselor because counselors will sometimes tell you things that are unacceptable. They don't feel very good. 

00:51:05
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:51:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN They might push you to work on things. So, I think it takes courage, takes courage to be videoed. So, I'm gonna add that to the list if that's okay. 

00:51:15
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:51:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Courage. Uhm, your smile. You have a great smile. 

00:51:20
UNKNOWN  It doesn't happen very often 'coz I'm always at, in a bad attitude. (laughs) 

00:51:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, you really have a great smile. 

00:51:30
UNKNOWN  Yeah. 

00:51:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You have this kind of straight white teeth. And, you know, so I could put that down? 

00:51:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:51:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Even though, maybe this doesn't happen as much as other people might like it or you might like it that's happening, okay? In other ways, uhm, your persistence. Do you think you're a persistent person? 

00:52:05
UNKNOWN What does that mean? (laughs) 

00:52:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  I'm glad you asked. Persistence is, uhm, it's when you just keep trying, you keep working at it. You don't stop. Nobody is stopping. You just keep going. It's like the energizer bunny. You just keep going and going. And sure, you're tired at 4:30 in the morning but you're getting up and you're makin' things happen. 

00:52:30
UNKNOWN Yup. I would say that I'm very persistent 'coz I felt (inaudible ) without I'd probably would have left a long time ago in this place. 

00:52:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Exactly. 

00:52:40
UNKNOWN Just because of everything that's going on and happened. 

00:52:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You hanging there, you know, even though, you're telling me that your boyfriend is acting like he's right all the time and being very difficult to deal with. 

00:53:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:53:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And you're hanging in their with that relationship and you're hanging in there with work and with everything else that's going on. You persisted and got your GED. You're having to persist and wait to get your driver's license from Washington. 

00:53:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:53:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  I guess(ph) your birth certificate so you can get your driver's license. (crosstalk) 

00:53:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:53:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So, all of those things taken (inaudible ) persistence. So, can I put that down? 

00:53:26
UNKNOWN Yup. 

00:53:26
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  And you learn a new word? 

00:53:30
UNKNOWN Yup. 

00:53:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Which, and I think this isn't really here. You do have my intelligence down here but I think that there's a part of you that just wants to keep learning and becoming a better person. 

00:53:50
UNKNOWN Definitely. 

00:53:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So, so, that part of you that wants to learn and become a better person. Okay. In fact, when you talk about... (crosstalk) 

00:54:10
UNKNOWN Hmm. 

00:54:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN ...becoming something that nobody else in your family ever really done anything, you wanted... (crosstalk) 

00:54:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:54:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN ...to try. So, so you got all these good things. 

00:54:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN John, I really like how, the what's-good-about-you strategy worked with her. Uhm, she's struggled a little bit... (crosstalk) 

00:54:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:54:35
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN ...and, and kids do. Ah, all of us do try to come up with those but I think it really worked for her. And the fact that you had some positive things to add at the end helped a lot. 

00:54:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I liked the way it worked, too. She took it very seriously. Ah, one thing when I'm doing that particular technique is I try to be somewhat rigid and stay with that formula of what's-good-about-you-thank-you-what's-good-about-you. It feels a little artificial. Uhm, and it also kinda forces the person to struggle. 

00:55:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:55:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And I think the struggle is okay and being rigid is okay as long as I've got some supportive positive things I can make to her at the end. 

00:55:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:55:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And kind of build her up. (crosstalk) 

00:55:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:55:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Ah, and I think it went pretty well. 

00:55:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:55:15
[sil.] 

00:55:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  This next clip is actually one of my favorites. It's John working with a young man, who is really eager to work and John helps him really try to take perspective, uhm, the perspective of people around him that he's struggling with. 

00:55:35
UNKNOWN  Help me understand teachers? (chuckles) I cannot do it. It's like no matter what they say, I just cannot, like, relate to what they're saying 'coz they always try to be your friend but they don't even know you yet and they're kind to be your friend and I don't understand that. 

00:55:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Ah, so, teachers are kinda of a puzzle to you? 

00:55:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. So. (crosstalk) 

00:55:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  And because they don't know you but they still try to be your friend? 

00:56:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. I mean, maybe they are just trying to get close to you or something. (crosstalk) 

00:56:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:56:05
UNKNOWN I just don't know. 

00:56:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  And that confuses you. 

00:56:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, they act like too friendly. 

00:56:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Way too friendly. 

00:56:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:56:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:56:10
UNKNOWN  Like kind of fake almost. 

00:56:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. What would you do if you were a teacher? (chuckles) Let's just pretend, okay? Try to imagine that you're going into a classroom. It's your job, ah, let say you got 20 people, 20 students in the classroom. How are you gonna do that? 

00:56:30
UNKNOWN  First day in there, see, I'd better be thinking like a teacher and just act like a teacher but just because I've seen teachers act so I probably more likely act like one of them and try to do what they do. But since, since I've already feel that they're doing that and I feel that it's fake, I would just be myself. But I don't really know. (crosstalk) 

00:57:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:57:00
UNKNOWN I can't think. 

00:57:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  So, it's a hard question... (crosstalk) 

00:57:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:57:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN ...to put yourself in their shoes. 

00:57:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:57:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN But I hear you're saying, your, your impulse might not to be like them which you criticize as being fake but then you think, well, I would just be myself. Yeah. 

00:57:15
UNKNOWN Maybe that's what they're doing or, or I don't realize that. 

00:57:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  They just seemed like they're being fake? So, is that possible? 

00:57:20
UNKNOWN Yes. That could be. 

00:57:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, maybe, here's something, here's something that I might do, okay? If I was a teacher and, ah, I'm going to a classroom where I don't know people, I might try too hard, you know. 

00:57:35
UNKNOWN  Okay. 

00:57:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I might say, "Hey Michael, how is it going?" You know, I'm might trying to chum up to you because I want you to like me. Ah, I want you to learn from me. 

00:57:45
UNKNOWN  I see what you're saying. 

00:57:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I might try too hard so that, it even come across as phony but it's not so much a phony as it is trying too hard... (crosstalk) 

00:58:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:58:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN ...you know. I want you to be, I want you to like me. 

00:58:05
UNKNOWN The teacher (inaudible ) that that their class goes better for you and (inaudible ). Huh. 

00:58:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, that makes some sense possibly. 

00:58:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:58:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I was just trying to think, if I was in a teacher's shoes, what, what I wanna do, what I'm hearing from you is that you struggle to figure teachers out. And sometimes, you don't trust people very well, but you're working on it. 

00:58:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:58:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And that you are, and you know, in from our little discussion, it sounds like, if you just sit and think about it and kinda put yourself in the teacher's shoes or in the friend's shoes, that you're pretty smart. And you can kinda figure out quite a bit what's going on. What will you do? You think that's true? (crosstalk) 

00:58:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. I think that's, yeah, that seems true. In my mind, it seems true. 

00:59:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I'm thinking even if somebody, let's just say, I meet you and get to know you and act like I'm your friend. And then, I say some nasty things behind your back that aren't even true. Okay? You, you look uncomfortable, I, you know I pretend that. Uhm, I bet you can even figure out what that's about. You know, if you put yourself in my shoes, okay, I get to know you a little bit. And then, I start saying nasty things about you. What do you think, what do you think that's about? 

00:59:45
UNKNOWN  I don't know. 'Coz, 'coz you think that I'm being fake. 

00:59:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Maybe I would be not liking something about you. I'm thinking you're a phony or fake. 

00:59:55
UNKNOWN  Uhm, the attitude, uhm, I don't really, I don't know why. (crosstalk) 

01:00:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Hmm. 

01:00:05
UNKNOWN  He would start off us(ph) like that and then just all of a sudden turn around like that all of a sudden. 

01:00:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Uh hmm. 

01:00:15
UNKNOWN I don't know. 

01:00:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Hmm. Why do you think, you, you, you've, you've watched some television, you see, you, you tell me you know how anger and aggression can lead to bad things. So, try to think like, I mean, I, I, I want you to try to think like a psychologist, okay? Try to think like, hitting the person's head. Why would somebody be nice to somebody at first and then betray him? What makes people act like that? 

01:00:45
[sil.] 

01:00:45
UNKNOWN  Ah, I don't know. Uhm, just to use them, well, I don't, I have no clue. 

01:01:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN No clue, have you ever done it? Hmm. 

01:01:00
UNKNOWN  Yeah, actually. Yeah, I would be 'coz it's(ph) easy. It was because they wanted something from that person at that time and after they got that, they're done with it. They don't need you no more, so they push you away, yeah. 

01:01:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, you've... (crosstalk) 

01:01:15
UNKNOWN I, I've done that. 

01:01:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You've actually done that? 

01:01:15
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:01:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Okay. Okay. So, so you kinda see how that works? You can kinda think about, well, have I ever done that? And I want you to think with me on this, now sometimes people push people away because they don't feel like they're good enough, right? Maybe I get to know you, and I think, "Well, he seemed like a nice guy." I'm not good enough to be his friend. I better treat him like crap. 

01:01:40
UNKNOWN I've done that, too. 

01:01:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Oh, yeah? 

01:01:45
UNKNOWN I've done that, too. Like, there's, I have this friend here, (inaudible ) Stevo(ph), and he seems like way too, he's like way(ph) nice, he has this perfect, good, do-good attitude, and I like, was trying to push him away because I was nothing like that. (crosstalk) 

01:02:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:02:00
UNKNOWN I don't think he wanted to hang out with me at all. I thought he was doing it just to be nice to me. 

01:02:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh-huh. 

01:02:05
UNKNOWN So I started pushing him away. 

01:02:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I don't think(ph). (crosstalk) 

01:02:05
UNKNOWN I know exactly what to do now. 

01:02:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. You see and so ah, what I'm trying to do is to say that you are pretty, you're a pretty smart guy. And so one of the things that you could do that you, that you, that you're not doing a lot right now of, ah, why do people act the way they do? Maybe they feel they're not good enough. Maybe they're just using somebody. Maybe the teachers are just trying too hard, you know? 

01:02:35
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:02:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so you come up with these ideas about why people not be doing the things they're doing? They might be the right explanation, they might be wrong. But what it does it gives you more understanding of what might be happening. 

01:02:45
UNKNOWN It does. 

01:02:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  So most people, just like you, if you're telling me, keep people at a distance, you do that, because people have betrayed you. 

01:03:00
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:03:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right? Most people are the way they are for some reason. And if you can kinda try to figure it out. Sometimes, it's helpful. 

01:03:10
UNKNOWN I never thought about that before. 

01:03:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:03:10
UNKNOWN  That's right. That's gonna open my eyes up to that a little bit more now the... (crosstalk) 

01:03:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:03:15
UNKNOWN ...that you say that. 

01:03:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  You gotta put yourself in other people's shoes, you know, you're smart. 

01:03:20
UNKNOWN  Right. 

01:03:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Now, we're down to the final clip. This last session is John working with an African-American young woman, who he has seen a couple of other times. Even in the brief clip that we're going to watch, you'll notice how camera-conscious she is. But it's definitely a clip that shows some interesting dynamics. 

01:03:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I should also mention, this is a girl, who, the issue that we're working on, I've seen her before... (crosstalk) 

01:03:45
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

01:03:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN ...and the issue that we're working on is how she intimidates other people socially. She's tall. She's attractive. She's intelligent. She's got this kinda powerful, imposing personality. And so she sometimes scares people. And what we work on, what we ended up working on after we've done, "what's good about you," which isn't shown in the clip. 

01:04:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Uh hmm. 

01:04:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uhm, we somehow get into a discussion on how, of, of, of how she has trouble expressing her affection and her love to people who she cares about. 

01:04:15
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh hmm. 

01:04:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And to anyone. And so we've finally worked on some homework around the issue of giving compliments. 

01:04:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:04:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And it's an... (crosstalk) 

01:04:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

01:04:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN ..interesting dynamic. 

01:04:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You might watch for that, uhm, "muscle metaphor" too and see how that works for you. 

01:04:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I feel so, I just (inaudible ) about the hood over my head and it didn't matter, you know, I mean, you see, he is kinda giving people a message. 

01:04:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. (laughs) 

01:04:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That you don't really matter that much to me. You don't really matter that much to me? 

01:04:45
UNKNOWN Okay, I see now. I've, at first, I didn't but, yeah. 

01:04:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So, how could you give people a message that they actually matter to you? That you want (inaudible ). 

01:04:57
UNKNOWN Well, I sit there with one of my legs crossing. 

01:04:57
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Act like it. 

01:05:00
UNKNOWN Yeah, then I get, now, I just care a little more. Or just, you know. (crosstalk) 

01:05:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I think you do care some, right? 

01:05:05
UNKNOWN I do. It's just when I'm not feeling something, I'm not feeling it, you know? 

01:05:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You got me okay, uhm, and use these athletic metaphor that I use a lot and that is, hey, you've got muscles, right? Are you right-handed or left-handed? 

01:05:20
UNKNOWN Right-handed. 

01:05:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Which muscles are bigger, your right hand, your left hand? 

01:05:25
UNKNOWN My right. 

01:05:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Because? 

01:05:25
UNKNOWN  I jack off, no. (laughs) No, I, because I use this the most? 

01:05:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. You use that one the most so it gets to be the biggest muscle, it's stronger, okay? You got, ah, I-don't-give-a-shit strong, I-don't-give-a-shit muscle, okay? 'Coz you worked it. 'Coz you don't want people to get to you. 'Coz you said, and this is one of your good qualities, is you don't take no stuff. And I know you meant, shit. So, right? 

01:06:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:06:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay, so you've worked that muscle. You got it. Boom. It popped. It's out there. 

01:06:05
UNKNOWN And that's nasty. 

01:06:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Nas, there's another muscle, okay? 

01:06:10
UNKNOWN My left part? 

01:06:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. That maybe isn't quite as strong. 'Coz you haven't practice it to be so much. This is the I-don't-give-a-shit muscle. It's pretty darn developed. This is the I-care-about-you muscle. Communicate it to other people. You don't use that very often. 

01:06:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:06:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  That cause any, I mean, I'm gonna, this is a personal question, you don't have to answer it. Does it cause any problems in your relationship? 

01:06:40
UNKNOWN  See, now, I dunno what you're saying because you're speaking in metaphors. If you'd just tell me what you're saying. 

01:06:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN The fact that you don't say, "I love you. I care about you." You don't initiate that kind of a conversation. You don't say, "You, you really mean a lot to me. Thank you for being in my life." The fact that you don't say those kinds of things, does that present itself as a problem for somebody who you are in a romantic relationship with? Does the person say, "Hey, why don't you ever tell me, you care about me?" 

01:07:15
UNKNOWN I don't know. I try to then I just feel a little weird. (crosstalk) 

01:07:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, can you say. 

01:07:20
UNKNOWN So I just, I stop before anything it said, before I say anything. 

01:07:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You even stop it up before you say anything? 

01:07:25
UNKNOWN I like, ah, (crosstalk) 

01:07:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Never mind. 

01:07:30
UNKNOWN never mind. No, I don't, I don't know, probably, most likely. 

01:07:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  So, this is my suggestion for you, okay? 

01:07:35
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

01:07:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Is that you are a smart, talented person, who's clever, you have an excellent sense of humor, you got so many good qualities I can't list them all, okay? But one thing to work on, one homework assignment I'm giving you, something to practice over and over again, is to say to people who you care about, "I care about you. Thank you for being a friend." Giving them compliments. 

01:08:10
UNKNOWN I was going to do that on graduation. (laughs) 

01:08:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  You can. You'll wait 'til then, huh? 

01:08:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:08:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That's in August, whatever, you know, maybe later, it could probably... (crosstalk) 

01:08:20
UNKNOWN I mean that's it, don't expect again, you know.(crosstalk) 

01:08:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Nah. It's kinda of a once in a lifetime thing. 

01:08:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, pretty much. 

01:08:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  But you see, how weak that muscle must be? 

01:08:30
UNKNOWN It'll be all right. I'll just, instead of doing. (crosstalk) 

01:08:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You might will just cut it off. You're not even using it. 

01:08:35
UNKNOWN I do sometimes. Just, I don't know, I'm just, do this to my family, not really... (crosstalk) 

01:08:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:08:40
UNKNOWN  people outside, like, yeah, I don't know. 

01:08:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You see I'm saying those, something to think about. Just something that you could. (crosstalk) 

01:08:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:08:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, if you wanted to make that a little stronger, what would happen? I, I think it would be a really interesting experiment. Wait a minute, wait a minute, you told me, "I'm willing to try everything at least once." 

01:09:05
UNKNOWN I tried it. I just felt corny. And then, I expect it back, three or four or five, six days later and I don't get it back, so it's like. (crosstalk) 

01:09:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Not happening again? 

01:09:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. Don't expect a rose. (crosstalk) 

01:09:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN All right, so, I've said, ah, a lot of nice things to you today. I'm ready. No, just for you to say some kind of compliment, you think back. 

01:09:30
UNKNOWN  I don't know what I want to say. (crosstalk) 

01:09:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I'm waiting for it to come back. Just like you. 

01:09:35
UNKNOWN Ah, what will I say to you, I don't know. 

01:09:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Let me, let me rephrase it. We'll make it easier. I wanted to ask you at the end, uhm, what was helpful or interesting, you know, and you enjoyed about our time together? 

01:09:50
UNKNOWN  That we just talked, you know? 

01:09:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You enjoyed talking? 

01:09:55
UNKNOWN  Everybody does, you know? I'm pretty sure they, I hope they do. 

01:10:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  See, you're doing it, right now. See, what you're doing? You put your head under your hood and you're saying, "Anybody can enjoy this. This is not, this is not, not special like this. This isn't" You know, see? 

01:10:20
UNKNOWN Okay, you're right, you're right. (crosstalk) 

01:10:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah? 

01:10:20
UNKNOWN Uhm, I really enjoyed it, you know, we had to talk. (laughs) 

01:10:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  What did you enjoy? 

01:10:30
UNKNOWN Uhm, what did I enjoy that I'm on a video, you know, that's cool. 

01:10:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN  Yeah. 

01:10:40
UNKNOWN Once in a lifetime thing. 

01:10:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Anybody would enjoy that. 

01:10:40
UNKNOWN Not anybody, you know? Depends on who the person was I guess(ph), I would say that. 

01:10:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So it's ah, there's something kind of, for you, you feel a little bit special about being take, to be in a video? Getting this chance. 

01:10:55
UNKNOWN Ah, like my problem seemed interesting? (laughs) I don't know. I don't, well, when I choose somebody who is because of that? You know, they'd make the video get any one. 

01:11:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

01:11:10
UNKNOWN Than just someone I'd just go pick off who's classified themselves as perfect, you know. 

01:11:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay, so, your assignment, okay? You can accept it if you want to. It's like mission impossible. 

01:11:25
UNKNOWN  Okay. 

01:11:30
UNKNOWN Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to go around, compliment people over and over again with no thought about whether it's gonna come back to you. 

01:11:40
UNKNOWN  Okay. I'll try that. 

01:11:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN At least once. 

01:11:50
UNKNOWN A few times... 

01:11:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. (crosstalk) 

01:11:50
UNKNOWN ...different people. 

01:11:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. Give it a try. See what happens. 

01:11:50
UNKNOWN One, one per person. 

01:11:55
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, John, as I watched this clip, I was struck by how resistant this particular young woman can be. You know, it kinda shows in her bearing and, and yet, you get her to agree to try giving some compliments, not necessarily, to you. 

01:12:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And, and what's interesting to me, is I know, she wasn't very rewarding or positive back to me, but I still really enjoyed working with her. 

01:12:20
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah.

JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so what I find is that even though working with challenging youth cannot be very rewarding directly, that there's something about it that I can really appreciate and deeply enjoy. 

01:12:30
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. And we both believe that's essential. The relationship with the young person is what has to underlie all of the techniques and strategies that you might use for engagement or intervention or assessment. And if the relationship isn't there, the rest of it really doesn't matter. So, the thing that's important is to assess if you can work with kids and if you like working with kids, because if you don't they will sense it. They, they understand that. 

01:13:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And if they sense it, and they understand that, they just might make your therapeutic life a little bit miserable. 

01:13:05
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN (laughs) Real quite miserable. 

01:13:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Real quite miserable and I've certainly had that experience sometimes. But I also have to say that, maybe it's my own attitude, but even when young people are very difficult and make my life a little bit miserable, there's still something that's kinda enjoyable or even fun about the interaction. 

01:13:25
RITA SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Alright. And I've always thought that maybe the kid in you, but. And anyway, we hope you've had some fun watching these videotapes and the clips that the kids offer, and we also wish you the very best in working with tough kids.
