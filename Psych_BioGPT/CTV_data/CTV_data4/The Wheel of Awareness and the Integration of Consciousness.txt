DAN SIEGEL Let's have one good morning. Good morning everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you this morning. My name is Dan Siegel and, ah, we'll be doing a clinical demonstration this morning of a process called the Wheel of Awareness. Ah, and, ah, unlike any other clinical demonstrations where we have one person on the stage with the presenter who is demonstrating on the one individual, this clinical demonstration will actually involve all of you as the volunteers. So, you are the volunteers. Is that okay with you? 

00:00:35
 Yeah. 

00:00:35
DAN SIEGEL Good. It's always, ah, fun to se-- see, uhm, people run to the stage because we are taught everybody can be on the stage. So, ah, this, ah, Wheel of Awareness of practice is something you'll be doing from your chair, ah, so you don't need to, to leave unless, ah, you have a hard time sitting for about half an hour pretty still. Ah, in which case, you can come up here and either sit on the floor or lie on the floor or whatever you want. We'll be going through a couple of general, uhm, instructions as people continue to enter the auditorium, so, uhm, we're not disturbed as we go. So, I'll just give you a few, uhm, introductory remarks. We'll be doing about a half hour reflective practice and then for anyone who would like to briefly share their experiences, ah, there are microphones in the audience where we'll hear what people's, ah, reflections are and then we'll go to a discussion of, ah, what the Wheel is, uhm, how it was created, what, what use it has in clinical practice, ah, and then we'll, we'll close. So, uhm, how many of you have a reflective practice that you do on a regular basis? Raise your hands. Okay, so that's about, ah, a quarter of the group, uhm, and some people would call this taking time in which is what I call it or, ah, having a meditation practice. Meditation just means, ah, strengthening the mind, ah, and so this is a practice that will strengthen your mind. Uhm, how many of you have, uhm, done a reflective practice in a group experience before? Okay. So, great. So you know that there are couple of rules that we need to mention. Ah, one is that when you take time to focus inwardly, the usual stimuli that we are adjusted to like seeing things or hearing things, ah, is something that keeps us pretty stimulated and wide-awake. Ah, so when you do an intentional practice to focus inwardly, for a lot of people specially when it's new, it leads to a decrease in the amount of energy going through your system and so some people get really distracted which is natural, that's a part of the practice, ah, and some people actually get sleepy and some people actually fall asleep. So if you do fall asleep during this practice you can go to my website later on which is drdansiegel.com and you can do this practice on your own, ah, the Wheel of Awareness practice, uhm, but there is one situation where falling asleep in a group setting, ah, needs to be just stayed in which is if you tend to snore. Snoring is a hard, ah, sound to ignore, uhm, when you're trying to ignore it, uhm, or maybe specially when you're trying to ignore it. So, uhm, we need a group consensus that if someone near you is snoring, if you are the snorer, do give permission to someone near you to gently and lovingly kinda wake you up with a nudge. Yeah, that's good. And if there's someone who doesn't feel comfortable with that, you can up here and I'll wake you up. Uhm, it's just a very important way that we, we have a group on our, ah, what we're about to do. Uhm, the second thing is, ah, you know, this is a practice that will be using the circuitry of your brain in ways we'll talk about after the practice. Ah, it's, it was designed, actually, to help people integrate the brain and we'll talk about the details of that later on. Uhm, but in doing that, it's a very active practice so the way you wanna, uhm, have your body during the practice is even though your body will be still, your mind will be very, very active so you wanna sit comfortably in the chair since all of this is written in various books, it's in the pocket guide Interpersonal Neurobiology, The Mindful Therapist, it's in Mindsight, it's in the new book Brainstorm for Adolescence, teaching adolescence how to do this. So you, you don't have to take notes during this, uhm, and since it's being recorded and since it's on my website, you, you don't have to, ah, try to memorize it. You could just let yourself experience it. So, if you put your stuff down, ah, uncross your legs if they're crossed so you're on two feet flat on the floor, you-- ideally, wanna have your back straight if you can do that and comfortable, ah, you can have your hands in your lap or some people like to put them laced fingers together. Whatever, whatever is comfortable for you in your lap or on your, on your legs. Uhm, since this is a, ah, an active practice, you wanna really have a sense of dignity so some people like to express that through the body with a chest that's, you know, a little bit raised, you know, I'm about to do something that's really good for my brain, ah, and so the sense of, of dignity but comfortable. And certainly if you need to move during this, that's okay. Uhm, but you wanna your body as comfortable as possible. Now, if you find that you prefer to do this practice, ah, with your eyes open, that's completely fine. Some people like them partially closed, a lot of people like to just close their eyes to really focus on what attention is going to be doing. Ah, so however you feel most comfortable with your eyes, it's fine. Uhm, and the thing to notice though is your state of being awake or asleep. If you find, as we go through the Wheel, you are getting sleepier and sleepier you can open your eyes and let light in and that can stimulate your brain and wake you up. Ah, if that doesn't do it, this entire practice can be done standing up. So, feel free to stand up, hold the back of your chair, or come on up here and lean against the stage, it's completely fine. You can do this whole practice standing up. So, in a way the first part of this practice that we're introducing is the idea of monitoring your internal state including whether you're falling asleep or not. So, even though you may be falling asleep, you have the ability to monitor and say, "Oh yeah, I can open my eyes," "Oh yeah, I can stand up," "Oh yeah, I can walk by the stage and stand by Dan," whatever you do, you can be in charge of that. So, we're really strengthening this ability to monitor what's happening inside of you that's why we call it time in. So, be, be aware of that as we go and we're gonna begin first with a, ah, simple universal practice that's bound throughout the world, ah, that's called the breath practice. It's super simple but it's a good way to start specially because the majority of us in the room have never done this kind of thing before. So, I will teach this to you as I would teach it to a client or a patient in my office. It's also something we're teaching to, ah, kids in school as young as kindergarten with already some wonderful research established results so, uhm, it's an exciting thing to, to be able to teach this not just in clinical settings but also just in educational settings. So with your eyes open, ah, if you can direct your visual attention toward me, in my direction, and let your attention come to about this place, the, ah, the beginning of the stage here with your eyes and now send your attention back to this screen behind me and then let your attention come to the middle of the room and now allow your attention to come to about book reading distance as if you had a book or magazine resting in your hands. And notice how you can determine where attention goes. You can determine where attention goes. And for this initial breath practice, I invite you to let your attention go to the level of the breath at your nostrils letting the sensation of the air flowing in and out of the nostrils be the focus of attention and let awareness just become filled with that sensation with the air, in and out. You can keep your eyes open, partially closed them, or close them, whatever you want to do it, it's fine. And notice how you can move attention down to the level of the chest where the sensation of the rising and falling of the chest fills awareness. 

00:09:30
[sil.] 

00:09:35
DAN SIEGEL And now notice how you can let your attention move to the level of your abdomen and if you've never done belly breathing you can put a hand on your abdomen and notice when air fills the lungs, the abdomen actually moves outward and when the air escapes, the lungs-- the abdomen moves inward. And just let the sensation of the outward and inward movement of the abdomen be the focus of attention and let those sensations fill awareness.

00:10:30
DAN SIEGEL And now, what I invite you to do is let attention find the breath wherever you feel it most naturally. It might be resting on the sensations of the abdomen moving out and in, it may be the chest rising and falling, it may be the sensations of the air just moving through the nostrils. Wherever you feel it most naturally, let that be the focus of attention. And let me give you the brief and universal instructions that are so simple yet so important for us to do. It goes simply like this. For this breath awareness practice, we're doing initially, let the sensation of the breath, wherever you feel it, it could be the whole body breathing or air at the nostrils, the chest rising and falling or the abdomen moving in and out, wherever you feel it most naturally is fine. But let that be the focus and just let awareness be filled with the sensation of the breath. And then as happens with many people, at some point, you may notice that you're no longer focusing on the breath, that you're attention has gone to something else, what you're doing this afternoon, what you did last week, what you wanna do in the next month. And when your thoughts or your memories or your feelings have actually distracted you from focusing on the breath, just take note of that distraction. Some people like to say the word, "thinking, thinking," if they're thinking about something or "remembering, remembering," if they're remembering, or "feeling, feeling," whatever. Some people don't like to say those words but the point of saying the words is just to let the distraction be identified and let it go and return the focus of attention to the breath, letting the sensation of the breath fill awareness. And as you do this, the key is to be kind to yourself. The human mind has a mind of its own and it will take you wherever it wants to go. So, knowing that, you just notice the distraction, knowing that the task is to focus on the breath, you're a human being, the mind got distracted and now you've noticed the distraction, Okay, that's it. That's interesting. You've let it go, refocus on the breath. Kindness and compassion toward yourself are built into this practice and even if you find yourself being hard on yourself, you can just say, you know, "Hard on myself. Hard on myself," and let that go. But the idea is to let it go and return to the breath. And let's begin this simple breath practice right now and just let yourself focus on the sensation of the breath returning to that focus after just distraction takes you away.

00:14:30
DAN SIEGEL And now I invite you to take, ah, more intentional or perhaps a deeper breath and we'll let this breath practice go for now. Knowing that, you know, studies show that if you just do the simple breath practice, once a day for a certain number... uhm, you will actually hugely transform all aspects of your capacity for self-regulations, absolutely amazing. That... doesn't cost anything, it's just a matter of doing it. Now, when we build on this initial practice that just gets you used to going time in and focusing attention is a natural progression toward the next practice and I invite you to open your eyes if they're closed and let your visual attention go to the screen. 

00:15:20
The Wheel of Awareness Sixth Sense First Five Senses Spoke Hub Seventh Sense Rim Eighth Sense 2013 ANAHEIM 

00:15:20
DAN SIEGEL And here is, ah, a picture of a table in my office where I would do this practice, ah, instead of calling it a table of awareness, it was sounded better to call it The Wheel of Awareness. Uhm, and the way it works is this, in consciousness, we can imagine two fundamental elements that can be separated from each other and explored and different ways we're gonna do right now. One would be represented in this wheel as a central hub, the other represented as the rim of this Wheel of Awareness and the experience in the is the sense of the knowing - that is consciousness or awareness; the rim represents anything that can be know which is you can see, you can divide if you'd like it too, eight different senses that are placed on four different sectors, really easy to remember. The first segment here is representing our external world sensations like what we see or hear or smell or taste or touch. We then can move the spoke of attention which is how we direct energy and information flow over to the next segment of the rim which can be call our sixth sense. It's what we call it in science. This is also known as the interoception, the perception of the interior. The interior means the interior of the body so we'll look at the muscles and bones, we'll look at the internal organs like the intestines and the heart and let the sensations of those bodily internal states arise an awareness then we move the spoke over again to this third segment of the rim here and this is representing what I call the seventh sense which is basically our sense of mental life, of emotions, thoughts, memories, ideas, beliefs, intentions, hopes, dreams. Everything that you know is what mental life is comprised of is represented here on the seventh sense. And then there's even a final eighth sense which I believe is a really important one that, ah, we need to highlight in our lives these days, our sense of connectedness to other people and to the planet, a relational sense or eight sense. So we'll explore that right now and we'll leave and explore some other things to as we go. So this is the Wheel of Awareness and what I ask you to do is take a good look at it with your eyes. For some people when they get into this practice, they can actually envision this which is wonderful. If you're like me, you can't do that for reasons, va-- various reasons. Some of us ha-- don't have that kind of eidetic imagery but at least you have the idea of the wheel. That's all you need have is the idea. So, even if you can't picture it, don't worry about it. So if I say the phrase, "Imagine the wheel and your-- in the hub," you don't need to be able to see that. You just now have the vision of it with your eyes and you have the idea of it. That's all you really need. Ah, for my patients, they actually had the table with to walk around so that was concrete. They could be around this thing. So here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna start with the brief breath practice. So let's get yourself ready, if you need to stretch a little bit after the breath practice, I want you to do that. So get yourself comfortable cuz this practice unlike the last one which actually took one minute, we did the fu-- the breath part just for 60 seconds. This one is gonna be a little bit longer, it'll be, ah, over 20 minutes. So you really wanna get comfortable. As I said, if you can't sit still for 20 minutes, please come on up here and lie down on the floor, you can come up on the stage, whatever you wanna do. Okay, so, imagining the wheel, let yourself first find the breath wherever you feel it most naturally and ride the wave of the breath in and out. Eyes open, eyes partially closed, eyes closed, whatever is comfortable for you is... 

00:19:40
[sil.] 

00:19:45
DAN SIEGEL And imagine that the sensation of calmness and clarity that may be available to you by focusing on the breath actually accesses you to the hub of the Wheel of Awareness. It brings you to this inner sense of calm and clarity which is our sense of knowing within awareness. And now I ask you to let the breath go and imagine the Wheel of Awareness and imagine that you're in the hub, in this place of tranquility, and clarity. And from that hub, you can choose where to send the tension and now imagine that you're in the hub of the Wheel of Awareness, the sense of knowing. And you're sending the spoke, the spoke of attention out to the first segment of the rim and let's begin with the sense of hearing and let's allow sound to fill awareness.

00:20:50

00:21:05
DAN SIEGEL And now moving the spoke over a bit, this time to the sense of sight. If you like, you can just light come in through your closed eyelids, fill awareness, or open your eyelids a bit and have a gentle focus, bring in all the light and let awareness become filled with the sense of sight. 

00:21:35
[sil.] 

00:21:40
DAN SIEGEL And now moving the spoke over a bit to the sense of smell, letting any odors fill awareness. 

00:21:50
[sil.] 

00:22:05
DAN SIEGEL And now moving the spoke over a bit more to the sense of taste, letting tastes fill awareness. 

00:22:20
[sil.] 

00:22:30
DAN SIEGEL Now, moving the spoke over one more time to the sense of touch, letting anywhere skin is touching clothing or skin touching skin or furniture. Let the sense of touch fill awareness. 

00:22:50
[sil.] 

00:23:00
DAN SIEGEL And now taking a bit of a deeper breath. Imagine moving the spoke from this first segment of the rim of the outside world senses, now to the segment of the rim and this is the segment that represents the interior of the body or sixth sense interoception. And we'll begin with the facial area letting the sensations of the muscles and the bones in the facial region fill awareness. And then moving attention upward to the top of the head, the scalp letting the muscles and bones there, the sensations fill awareness. 

00:23:55
[sil.] 

00:24:00
DAN SIEGEL And then to the side of the head and the back of the head. 

00:24:10
[sil.] 

00:24:15
DAN SIEGEL And now moving attention to the throat, to the neck. 

00:24:25
[sil.] 

00:24:30
DAN SIEGEL And now moving attention to the muscles and bones of the shoulders. And then streaming attention down both arms, to the elbows, wrists, and the ends of the fingers. 

00:24:55
[sil.] 

00:25:00
DAN SIEGEL And now moving attention to the upper back and the chest. And then to the lower back and the muscles of the abdomen. 

00:25:20
[sil.] 

00:25:25
DAN SIEGEL And now moving attention to the hips. 

00:25:30
[sil.] 

00:25:35
DAN SIEGEL And streaming attention down both legs, to the knees, to the ankles, to the ends of the toes. And now bringing attention to the pelvic region, to the sensations of the genitals. 

00:26:05
[sil.] 

00:26:10
DAN SIEGEL And now moving attention to the intestines beginning in the lower abdomen and now moving up to the upper abdomen and the stomach and then moving upward to the interior of the throat. 

00:26:40
[sil.] 

00:26:45
DAN SIEGEL And now moving attention to the interior of the lungs. 

00:26:55
[sil.] 

00:27:00
DAN SIEGEL And then centering attention in the heart region. 

00:27:10
[sil.] 

00:27:15
DAN SIEGEL And now letting the whole of the interior of the body and then the entirety of the interior of the body fill awareness, head to toe.

00:27:35

00:27:40
DAN SIEGEL And knowing that modern science is now demonstrated with wisdom traditions have known for thousands of years, that bringing in the wisdom of these signals of the interior of the body enriches our lives. We now get ready to take a deeper breath and will let this aspect of the Wheel of Awareness go for now and imagine moving the spoke over from the second segment of the interior of the body, now to the third segment of the rim. In this segment of the rim represents our mental lives, our feelings, memories, thoughts, hopes, dreams, images, attitudes, longings, beliefs, anything that's the activity of the mind is represented is in this third segment of the rim. And to experience this aspect of the rim, we'll do this in two parts. For the first part, I invite resting in the hub of the Wheel of Awareness to simply send the spoke to this segment of the rim and invite any kind of mental activity into awareness and just experience what that feels like. So, in some ways this is like the opposite of the breath practice where the target of attention was the breath. If a feeling or thought or memory or worry or something distracted attention, you intentionally identify the distraction, let it go, and return to the breath. This is kind of the opposite. Here, we're saying bring it on. Anything that comes in or any-- nothing that comes in it, anything whatsoever, just let it happen and rest in the hub of the wheel and just invite anything from mental life into awareness. Let's begin this first part of this part of the rim of you right now.

00:30:20
[sil.] 

00:31:05
DAN SIEGEL And now for the second part of this rim review of mental life, I'll again invite you to simply be aware whatever arises or doesn't arise from this aspect of the rim into awareness. Only this time I invite you to be study the nature by which a mental experience, let's say, a memory first presents itself to awareness and then how does it stay present and then how does it leave awareness. So you'll be paying particular attention to noticing how a mental activity, like a memory, first appears. Is it sudden? Is it gradual? Does it come from one place or another? Once it's presented itself to you in awareness, how does it stay there? Is it constant? Does it vibrate? Does it come and go? What it-- what is it like once it's there? And then how does it leave awareness? Gradual? Sudden? What's that like? Is it just a place by another mental activity? And if it's not replaced by another mental activity right away, what is the gap feel like between two mental activities? So, I'm inviting you here to become a student of the architecture of mental life and let's begin that practice right now. 

00:32:45

00:34:20
DAN SIEGEL Right in the wave of the breath in and out. 

00:34:25
[sil.] 

00:34:30
DAN SIEGEL And what I'd like to do here is, uhm, introduce you to what-- if you're doing this, uhm, in your practices, you might wait till someone has done it a long time but since this is an intensive group of therapists, let me see a nod of heads if you're willing to give a try to, ah, a bit of a more advanced step this moment. So just nod your heads. So most people nod their heads. If you're not open for it, just focus on the breath during this next minute or so, uhm, and when you hear me we'll go to the next segment you can come back in. But if you're up for it, this is something just to try in this workshop setting, uhm, and it goes like this. 

00:35:10
The Wheel of Awareness Sixth Sense First Five Senses Spoke Hub Seventh Sense Rim Eighth Sense 

00:35:10
DAN SIEGEL What I invite you to do is just focus on the breath and ride the wave of the breath in and out knowing that the sense of connection to the breath and the sense of inner clarity that can come with that is basically representing what we're calling the hub of the Wheel of Awareness and let the breath go. Just imagine yourself in this hub, this hub of knowing. And what we're gonna do in this step of the wheel practice is, again, from the hub, take that spoke of attention and send it from the hub only this time instead of the spoke of attention going to the rim, imagine bending that spoke around so you're gonna aim attention right back into the hub itself and just give this a try and just see whatever arises. So, in other words, from the hub, we send out the spoke of attention, we're now bending that spoke and aiming attention right into the hub of awareness and see what awareness of awareness feels like. 

00:36:35
[sil.] 

00:36:35
The Wheel of Awareness Sixth Sense First Five Senses Spoke Hub Seventh Sense Rim Eighth Sense 

00:38:45
DAN SIEGEL And now I invite you to find the breath right in the wave of the breath in and out. And now taking a bit of a deeper breath. Imagine moving our spoke over to the fourth segment of the rim now, and this is the segment of the rim that represents our connections to other things outside of our interior bodily cells. For example, connections to other people and let's begin by letting awareness become filled with the sense of connection to people closest to you in this room, right here, right now. Just that sense of connection to those immediately next to you in the room. And now let that sense of connection expand to include all of us experiencing this practice here together in this room today. 

00:40:00
[sil.] 

00:40:10
DAN SIEGEL And then opening that sense of connection to all of the friends and family who are not in this room today, all of the friends and family in our lives. 

00:40:25
[sil.] 

00:40:30
DAN SIEGEL And then expanding that sense of connection further to include the people in our lives with whom we work, our colleagues, our students, our teachers, our clients and patients. 

00:40:45
[sil.] 

00:40:55
DAN SIEGEL And then letting that sense of connection expand even further to people who live in our neighborhood, to people who share our community, to those who live in our city, to those with whom we share a state or province. And then expanding that sense of connection even further to those who live in our country, to those who live on our continent. And then allowing that sense of connection to expand to include all human beings who share our common home, this planet we call Earth. 

00:41:55
[sil.] 

00:42:00
DAN SIEGEL And then opening that sense of connection even further to all living beings on Earth. 

00:42:10
[sil.] 

00:42:20
DAN SIEGEL And then knowing that recent scientific research carefully conducted as demonstrated that bringing intentions of kindness and care to our connection to others not only increases the positive effect in the world, it actually hugely increases our own mental and medical well-being. Knowing that the science shows this, if you're open for it, I invite you to say the following phrases inside your mind and I'll say them in brief and I'll pause and then you can repeat them. Ah, but scientific studies have shown that people who do this actually statistically hugely increase well-being and these are the phrases that have been scientifically shown to be effective at doing that. We'll aim first these practices, these statements toward all living beings and then we'll bring them inward. So let's begin. May all living beings be happy and live with a joyful heart. May all living beings be healthy and have bodies that give them energy. May all living beings be safe and protected from all forms of harm. And may all living beings live with the ease that comes with well-being. 

00:44:35
[sil.] 

00:44:40
DAN SIEGEL And taking a bit of a deeper breath, we now take those same phrases and we direct them toward our interior lives, this interior bodily individualized sense of who we are with these following phrases using the word I. May I be happy and live with a joyful heart. May I be healthy and have a body that gives me energy. May I be safe and protected from all sort of harm. And may I live with the ease that comes with well being. 

00:45:50
[sil.] 

00:45:55
DAN SIEGEL And now finding the breath and riding the breath in and out. Invite you now to take a more intentional, perhaps deeper breath and we'll be ready now to bring this Wheel of Awareness practice to a close for today. If your eyes are shut, when you're ready you can let them gently come open. You can feel free to stretch and stand up a bit and move around. Thank you. We now have time for some sharing of reflections for a few minutes if anyone's up for that and, uhm, then we'll dive into a discussion of how to use this clinically and also what in the world happen there. 

00:46:55
2013 ANAHEIM 

00:46:55
DAN SIEGEL Uhm, so, let's begin with a couple of statements, ah, as we get ready for the people to share. If you're interested in sharing your reflections, please come to our microphones so the recording that's being made can capture your reflections and what I invite you to do at this moment in our, ah, presentation is to share you first person experience. Uhm, we won't get it to clinical applications or concepts yet but the first five minutes here will be just for trying to bring the insight out. Because our work, as I've said the other day in my workshop, was, ah, very important to remember for all of us that our work as mental health professionals is about the mind, the mind begins with subjective experience and there's no way to know it unless we listen deeply to the reflections of a person trying to communicate it and that's our art, that's our craft, and as you'll see soon that's our science. We begin with subjective experience and we'll begin with that with this discussion so please-- and come right close to the microphone. Use it like an ice cream cone or people won't be able to hear you, as if you're eating an ice cream cone. 

00:48:10
 Okay. Okay. Okay. So, I just want.... 

00:48:10
DAN SIEGEL And slowly right into the... 

00:48:15
 I just want to share the, the last part of the-- next to last Wheel-- looking conscious-- looking at consciousness? 

00:48:20
DAN SIEGEL Yes. 

00:48:25
 I had the most amazing experience of feeling my head expand and feeling-- and as I, as I was trying to look, trying to curve that around, it was like there's all this light and I was-- my head was getting big. I started to think I had a heart to talk about this and brought me back and I was going back and forth like that but it was the most amazing experience. 

00:48:45
DAN SIEGEL Can, can you say, what did it feel like, that amazing experience of you? 

00:48:50
 That felt great. 

00:48:50
DAN SIEGEL Great, great. Great. Thank you for sharing. Thank you. Ah, yes. Oh, is there-- there are two. We'll go back and forth. 

00:49:00
 Okay. Uhm, for the mental experience, - 

00:49:00
DAN SIEGEL Yes. 

00:49:00
 - I'm over here. 

00:49:00
DAN SIEGEL Yes, thank you. 

00:49:05
 Uhm, what happened from me was hearing a fragment of a song and that happens to me with some frequency and then what my mind does is wonder if there are some meaning or significance in that so I'd be curious if you wanted to comment on that. 

00:49:25
DAN SIEGEL I'll comment later. These are just sharing. Thank you for sharing and we'll, we'll get to that, thank you. Yes. 

00:49:30
 Uhm, as I was moving deeper into the meditation, I can no longer feel my, my hands and my feet. It was like I was disconnected from my body and I just felt this incredible sense of, uhm, emanating energy that was coming out of, out of me but I wasn't-- it's like I'm having a hard time getting grounded now because - 

00:49:50
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:49:50
 - I was so out of my body experience. And I had a, uhm, I was uncomfortable in the chair, I've had some pain in my back and it had just dissipated. 

00:49:55
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:49:55
 So, I can really see how effective this would be for people that have chronic illnesses, for instance. 

00:50:00
DAN SIEGEL Absolutely. How's the pain right now for you? 

00:50:05
 It's better. It, it like-- from a, from a, let's say, zero to 10, - 

00:50:10
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:50:10
 - before it was probably an eight, and now it's like a two. 

00:50:10
DAN SIEGEL Beautiful, thank you. 

00:50:15
 Yeah. Thank you. 

00:50:15
DAN SIEGEL Thank you for sharing. Thank you. Yes. Over here. Ah... 

00:50:20
 All the way down. 

00:50:20
DAN SIEGEL Oh, yes. Sorry. Uhm, right, right real close like an ice cream cone. 

00:50:20
 Oh, got it. Okay. 

00:50:30
DAN SIEGEL Yes. 

00:50:30
 When we did the turning the arrow inward, - 

00:50:30
DAN SIEGEL Yes. 

00:50:30
 - uhm, what I felt is pulsating light and energy out from my center of my heart, out on my extremities and each pulses are sense of well-being and then there'd be these little flashes of taking the awareness and sharing it and, ah, service which is, which is interesting. So, it went from energy outward to service and love. 

00:51:00
DAN SIEGEL Thank you, thank you very much. And I'll, I'll address this out as we go. Are you up next? 

00:51:10
 Uhm, I felt incredibly anxious through the whole thing which is unusual for me. First, in my chest; then, in my head; but as soon you said turning the spoke around and becoming aware of awareness, it kind of all stopped. 

00:51:30
DAN SIEGEL Wow. 

00:51:30
 I just felt incredibly calm. Now, I'm still anxious but felt calmed by that idea of imagining it turning around. 

00:51:40
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. Thank you. Thank you and we'll, we'll get to all of this, ah, after we have our discussion. Yes, thank you for sharing. 

00:51:50
 So, I've never done like turning it inward before, uhm, but, ah, my experience was I just recently on Space Mountain, ah, in Disneyland and it was, ah, an experience of traveling at a really rapid rate into complete darkness and then as this gentleman mentioned there was like light as if, you know, the planets or something, it was just unbelievable. It was amazing. So, uhm... 

00:52:20
DAN SIEGEL Beautiful. And I wish people could see your face. It's glowing. Yeah. Thank you. 

00:52:25
 Thank you. 

00:52:25
 Beautiful. Thank you for sharing. Yes, and let's do two more in each microphone. Yes, and that will be done. Thank you. Yes. 

00:52:30
 Ah, hi. 

00:52:30
DAN SIEGEL Hi. 

00:52:35
 I felt amazing self-kindness like, ah, very, very beautiful, ah, self-acceptance and, uhm, it's like the thing either-- usually either I try being the now or I try and, ah, do the body scan or I try and accept my, uhm, thoughts or I try imagine myself connected to people whether I pray or whether I work or whether-- and, yeah, it's an amazing. T-- thank you so much - 

00:53:05
DAN SIEGEL Thank you. 

00:53:10
 - for bringing all this in, in a very condensed, uhm, time. 

00:53:15
DAN SIEGEL Yes. 

00:53:15
 And, uhm, when you said observe how, ah, where it comes from like where your thoughts and, and-- I don't remember how you put it but your thoughts come from - 

00:53:25
DAN SIEGEL Yes. 

00:53:30
 - I saw like a fountain, uhm, very, very beautiful like light fountain and, and the architecture, you said something about the architecture of your - 

00:53:45
DAN SIEGEL Mental life, yeah. 

00:53:45
 - mental life, uhm, this was also very powerful. Thank you so much. 

00:53:50
DAN SIEGEL My pleasure. Thank you, thank you for sharing. And to hear it one there. Yes, please. 

00:53:55
 Uhm, I would just like to share that, ah, when you turn the awareness into the awareness, - 

00:54:00
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:54:00
 - uhm, I had a very interesting experience I've never experience before in doing any kind of meditation which was just almost the life review like it was photographs of moments of my life that were, ah, that I thought some were big but some were very, very small. Like things that I haven't-- I don't think I've ever remembered. 

00:54:30
DAN SIEGEL Wow. 

00:54:35
 So, it's, ah... 

00:54:35
DAN SIEGEL How did that feel to have that happened? 

00:54:40
 It's a really emotional feeling. 

00:54:40
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:54:40
 Yeah. 

00:54:40
DAN SIEGEL Emotion in a, in a sense of very meaningful or, or what? 

00:54:45
 Yeah. Like just, ah, almost I guess how I would imagine if you're gonna die. 

00:54:55
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. Being ready to just embrace it all. 

00:54:55
 Yeah. 

00:54:55
DAN SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:54:55
 To let go. 

00:55:00
DAN SIEGEL To let go. 

00:55:00
 And to appreciate, I guess. 

00:55:00
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:55:05
 And then my, my part in the bigger is almost eerie moments where I saw like, ah, my kindergarten teacher and her holding my hand at the desk and that sh-- that it was like I haven't-- that I was never in my awareness ever. 

00:55:25
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:55:25
 So, it was very profound. Thank you. 

00:55:30
DAN SIEGEL Wow. Well, thank you. Thank you for sharing. Thank you. Ah, one more here and then there. Yes, please. 

00:55:35
 I-- yes, I just had took, ah, small observations. The first one was that, uhm, when you asked us to bring our attention to our thinking process, - 

00:55:45
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:55:45
 - for the first time, my monkey brain shut up. 

00:55:50
DAN SIEGEL Isn't that funny? 

00:55:50
 Oh, yeah. I was like, "Oh, that's helpful." Maybe I just need to focus on it to get it to shut up. Uhm, and then the other thing is I'm a dance movement therapist so I'm very kinesthetically, ah, oriented and I noticed that when we were doing the interoceptive work and focusing on the internal systems, I really had to engage a little bit of movement - 

00:56:10
DAN SIEGEL Yeah. 

00:56:10
 - with it and I was just wondering if at some point you're gonna speak it all about the movement pro-- how movement can be incorporated into the mindfulness and awareness process. 

00:56:20
DAN SIEGEL Sure, sure. Absolutely. 

00:56:20
 Thank you. 

00:56:20
DAN SIEGEL Yes. Thank you for sharing. Thank you. And our, our last reflection for now. Yes. 

00:56:25
 Thank you. I went through so many different periods, so many different, uhm, ah, feelings. One of them embarrassingly was quite a lot the sexual longing, ah, in the, in the third section and then I went into the fourth, the deeper I went to clear when I-- that I deal awareness of awareness, uhm, I saw amazing colors. It was like oil on water and the, the deeper I went, the moments of profound deepness were linked with profound hallucinations if you like. 

00:56:55
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:57:00
 Beautiful feelings and beautiful visualizations linked together, - 

00:57:00
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:57:00
 - and then as I came out of that, the visualizations disappear again - 

00:57:05
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. 

00:57:05
 - and then back in again. It was, it was a lovely feeling. 

00:57:10
DAN SIEGEL Uh-hmm. Beautiful. Thank you. Thank you all for sharing. Wonderful. So, what I'd like to do, uhm, a couple of things, uhm, I'm noticing the time but I'm gonna take a presenter's prerogative if I don't get in trouble and see can we stay an extra 10 minutes, is that okay with you, people? And if you need to leave, you won't be hurting my feelings if you need to get to somewhere else but we need to honor that there's another group that's gonna start at 9:20. We wanna give them the 10 minutes they need to prepare. So, is that okay with you? Okay. So, if someone pulled me off with a hook you'll know why. Uhm, first of all, thank you, first, for participating in this practice, uhm, and thank you for, ah, having the courage to go into it, ah, and thank you for the reflections. What I'm gonna do in the next 10 minutes is try to address some of the implications of what were shared. Uhm, I've given this now to, to many people and we've had about of a third of a million people actually download it from our website, we get emails all the time, a very, very similar reflections from all over the planet so it's interesting, first of all, to say that the reflections you heard are, of course, unique to every individual. But each of the reflections that you heard is also universal that we found it comes from no matter what a person's culture, what a person's educational background, what a person's profession, what a person's experience in meditation even. We've had some of the most, ah, amazing kind of experience of all who've never meditated before, ever, or people who have been meditating for four years have things they've never experience before. So, that's really interesting. So, let me give you the frame in which to place these interesting data points cuz were basically trying to collect as our research data, as mental health professionals, the number one aspect of the mind is subjective experience. 

00:59:00
2013 ANAHEIM The Wheel of Awareness Sixth Sense First Five Senses Spoke Hub Seventh Sense Rim Eighth Sense 

00:59:05
DAN SIEGEL There's no substitute for it. Even though it was abandoned a hundred years ago from the various fields that study the mind, we're gonna reclaim it in the field of mental health. Subjective experience is the most important thing and you got the first person accounts, so that's the first thing. The second thing is about consciousness. This is a deep exploration of consciousness and just so you understand where this-- if we can put the wheel up for a second, uhm, ah, let me go back, that's the brain, that's an interesting thing but that's not we're gonna talk about. Let's go this way. So, the wheel, basically, literally, is a table in my office but it was emerging in the '90s, uhm, and even earlier than that that a process called integration was the basis of health, this is this whole field I work and call the interpersonal neurobiology where we combine all the different disciplines of science together into one. And in the book The Developing Mind published in '99, it basically said, "If you do that, if you combine all sciences into one, it looks like health comes from a process called integration. The second observation-- and integration is defined is differentiated elements of a system and then linking them. The second observation was that all processes of change in psychotherapy or in education involve consciousness. So the, the, the issue that arose in me as a therapist was what if we integrated consciousness and so I looked over in my room, it is in late '90s and I saw this table and I said, "Well, that's a good way to do it." Because this table has this central glass that you can see through and has this wood outer rim like this and these things that hold up the table that should look like spokes. So, I'd walk with my patients, I said, "Let's imagine this. We're gonna differentiate the elements of consciousness which is the most basic level includes two elements knowing the hub and the know, the rim, and we have this process that is not the same as consciousness but it's used by consciousness called attention. That's the streaming of energy and information flow and those are represented in the spokes. So the spokes would link at least the differentiated element of knowing from known and you'd be integrating consciousness and if you want to extend it then, you would differentiate the different elements of the known. So we did the first segment of the outside world, the second segment of the interior of the body, the third segment of the, uhm, experience of mental, the fourth segment of our connection to others, and even this other aspect, uhm, which, you know, if were the longest time I'd wait so people really experience and then for fun I just did in a workshop. And there were equal numbers of positive responders who had never meditated before in their life as the advanced people.

01:02:00
DAN SIEGEL So I thought why deprive people but it can frustrate people cuz that's a hard step I've got to tell you. Bending that spoke, it's not easy. So you wanna give some kind of frame not to tell people not to do it but not-- but just to let them know this is harder than any other things. Anyway, so, what happened in people with anxiety is the anxiety would melt away because as one of my patients said, "All I need to do is go to the hub cuz my anxiety is on the rim. And I know now that anxiety is just one point of a ton of points on the rim so it doesn't consume me anymore." 

01:02:35
The Wheel of Awareness Sixth Sense First Five Senses Spoke Hub Seventh Sense Rim Eighth Sense 2013 ANAHEIM 

01:02:35
DAN SIEGEL I can be friended without it imprisoning me. It was kind of startling. So it people to practice this everyday, it's a nice 20-minute practice, you know, they would take the tape from my, ah, recorded from the website and, and these changes improvement in our anxiety help. People with mild depression were improved. When I started teaching for the first time in Australia, everyone of the six cities I toured, some with severe chronic pain came up just as you heard today, I never thought this would really be something that we would touch. The pain disappeared or went from a severe level to very mild level and I've had these people emailed me, it's remain gone. And you could say, "Well, why is that?" Well, when you develop this capacity to integrate consciousness, if you imagine that pain creates its suffering by absorbing attention onto that one point on the rim, so attention is constantly going there, of course, it's gonna take over your life. But when you develop the ability to differentiate the hub from the rim, you're able to move that spoke around and you achieve this expansiveness of the hub. Now, I'm speaking in metaphoric terms, of course, because we have to ask the fundamental questions, one, how do we use this clinically so that what I'll suggest to you is that you can use it on everyone. You have to be careful at people who are prone to psychosis because this can get them disoriented but you can do a breath practice, research suggest, even with people with that who can be helped. But you have to be very careful, of course, cuz this can be unraveling. And people with dissociative disorders, you have to be very careful but I have-- I worked a lot with patients with dissociation. They found this unbelievably helpful and one of my patients who's a, has a big time dissociative issue, she actually let me, ah, put an email that she wrote to me and-- I can't remember which book it is-- about how helpful this wheel of practice was for her as a dissociative person. Because the hub helped her collect all of her aspects together. It was really quite, quite beautiful. The last thing I wanna say about this from a clinical point of view and I get into the mechanism, I think, that might be going on here is that if you take integration as what we do as therapists, then this is a tool we can use not only in the office but you can offer it for clients to use at home. So, all of the studies in neuroplasticity suggest that we need to be having our clients work on things everyday, not just once week or twice a week they see us. The brain needs repeated practice. So this is literally a practice of integrating consciousness that they can do. So, the last couple of minutes cuz I know we need to stop, I'm gonna introduce you to a proposal. It's explored in-depth in the pocket guide The Interpersonal Neurobiology which gives you a frame of this interdisciplinary field and it's in-depth in the, uhm, mindful therapist which teaches you how to do this yourself and explores it. So, what I'm gonna say is it's gonna seem really abstract but I'm just gonna give it a go in the following three minutes. 

01:05:45
The Wheel of Awareness Sixth Sense First Five Senses Spoke Hub Seventh Sense Rim Eighth Sense 2013 ANAHEIM 

01:05:45
DAN SIEGEL So, I understand what I'm gonna say is gonna be hard to grasp but it's all written down. Here's the idea. This wheel is purely a metaphor, there's no wheel anywhere but it allows you to picture how to differentiate the knowing of the hub, the known from the rim, and then move the spoke of attention so it's metaphoric. It's like a map. And like anything that's a map, it's only gonna help us get somewhere that there is much more rich and complex than the map, we need to understand that. However, we've been teaching this wheel to people as young as kindergarten with unbelievable results and Tina Bryson and I teach it in The Whole-Brain Child and we teach parents who to teach the wheel to little kids. So this is not just something for therapy, this is something for everybody. So, that's the first thing. So kids in kindergarten could say, "You know something I'm lost on my rim, give me, give me a break now, I wanna go to my hub so I can get back with the group." I'm serious about that. It's the most beautiful thing. 

01:06:40
The Evolution of Psychotherapy December 11-15 

01:06:45
DAN SIEGEL So then, as a scientist, of course, I also wanna know besides being a clinician and a parent on what helps which is what we've now covered. We're now gonna discuss what's actually going on. I believe very deeply that we in mental health can have a definition of the mind and for those of you who are at the worksho-- how many of you are at the workshop? Okay, there. So, for the have you that were there, you know we went in-- we spent three hours on this. You know, the mind can be defined as the self-organizing emergent process that arises from and turn backs-- ah, turns back and regulates energy flow. So, those of you who weren't in the workshop goes, "What is he talking about?" But those of you who were there, you know what I mean. So, if you sit down with physicists and say, "What is energy?" which I have been fortunately able to do, uhm, you get the following translation of their physics science and mathematics into the following proposal. Energy, the physicists tell us, is the potential to do stuff, that's what he say, comes in different forms but ultimately the way you measure it is along what's called a probability curve. And the probability curve goes between complete certainty like if I say, Disneyland, you know I just said Disneyland. But if I say, you know, you don't know what I'm gonna say. So, it moves down from certainty to uncertainty so the extreme is at near uncertainty. You have no idea what I'm gonna say. So there's a curve between certainty, certainty and uncertainty. I don't think I have it on my slide here. Let me take a quick look. Uhm, I don't think I've got it. Let' s just see. Yeah, this is to-- let me just try to find it for you very briefly. Uhm, let's see. So, basically, if it's going on this curve like that what we know is that, uhm,-- yeah, here it is. Ah, what we know is you can move, I'm not gonna make you bother with this, let me just tell you about it. We know you can move between certainty and uncertainty. The place of uncertainty is where the probability curve is near zero. The way of saying that is it's infinite possibility. It's like a plain, okay, and the curve moves up to plateaus of probability and peaks of certainty. And you'll see that when you see the graph. What I'm gonna suggesting to you is that the mind is that process which moves energy that it's regulating the flow of energy. What that really means is it's moving the probability from certainty to uncertainty and the plain of possibility is the hub. And the beautiful thing that it'll end with that is so profound is that when people move to this hub of the wheel of awareness, they've dropped into the plain of possibility and they have experienced this sense of expansive that you heard people t-- talk about, that liberates them from pain, that liberates them from obsessive thinking, that liberates them from trauma and the other thing is that your plain of possibility, your hub and my plain, my hub, are identical. So we find true connection when we strengthen the hub of our minds and we realize that we are am we, we have a differentiated me, an interconnected we, and together as we, we can honor our interconnectedness and try to really realize how profoundly interdependent, interconnected we are on the planet. And so the wheel of awareness practice has the promise of awakening in people this inner source not only of clarity and tranquility but awareness of how deeply together we really all are. So thank you very much for your attention.
