RICH SIMON Welcome everyone. My name's Rich Simon. I'm editor of Psychotherapy Networker and I'm your host for this series, Neuroscience In Action: How The Brain Matters, so as we've explored through these different installments in the series, there are any number of issues we are advancing (ph)understanding of the brain and its connection to psychotherapy and, uh, this time, for today's discussion, we're gonna focus on, uh, an issue that's can be quite contribu-, controversial and also absolutely crucial in understanding what goes on in people's lives and, (ph)predictably, those of us who are (ph)couples therapists. We're gonna be talking today about the myth of the unisex brain and we have with us, and we're very fortunate to have her, someone who's really the expert in this area who's written two bestselling books, The Male Brain and The Female Brain, and welcome, with me, Louann Brizendine. Louann, how are you? 

00:01:09
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Thanks for having me Rich. It's really a delight to get to talk with your audience since your audience is the one who sits carefully in their office and uh, helps people come to terms with who they are and, often, who they're married to. 

00:01:24
RICH SIMON So let's, let's talk about . . . So you have a very distinctive take on . . . Really, you . . . No one tells the story of the male and the female brain quite the way you do, so, uh, to begin with . . . Uh, so these are, these are two stories that really are, um . . . You make it clear that the brain, male and female brain, they're more alike than they are different. Sometimes people blur that; they don't hear that part of what you're saying. But, it's uh, what you have found in your reading of the research that there are really some really important differences. So what are these, what are the important differences that you really need to understand about the, the, the female brain and the male brain? 

00:02:09
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Well, I think, as you point out, the male and female brain, of course, are more alike than different. After all, we are the same species. However, there are some very important differences that Mother Nature has built into us for certain, specific purposes. So, remember, that when the sperm enters the egg, if that sperm is carrying an X chromosome it will be female, and if it's Y, the baby will be male. So from the moment of conception we are either male or female, and at eight weeks of gestation, the tiny testicles in the male start to pump out huge amounts of testosterone that marinates the male brain, changing the circuitry into male brain . . . 

00:02:54
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:02:54
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . so that by the time are all born we either have a male brain or a female brain. 

00:02:59
RICH SIMON Mm. Okay, so this . . . Let's, let's, for the moment . . . So with this male brain . . . So from the moments . . . So these are not . . . We're, we're, we're not blank slates. We not come in the world and we are the purely the product of our social conditioning, which is uh, an idea that was popular at least in our field, um, back, uh, oh, 10, 15 years ago, before we learned more about the brain. So, early on, how does this difference manifest itself between the male and female brain, when you look at very young infants and very young children, what do we see that distinguishes boys from girls? 

00:03:39
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Right, I think that's important to kind of look at because, of course, that marination of testosterone on the male brain that's changed that circuitry into male brain, and is, of course, the most important area that's grown in the male brain is an area in the hypothalamus called the area for sexual pursuit that (crosstalk)grows to be 2.5 times larger in the male brain than in the (crosstalk)female, so . . . 

00:04:04
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Uh-huh. (crosstalk)Wow. Okay. 

00:04:04
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . Mother Nature made it so that you guys have a very important purpose. You're supposed to search out fertile females and impregnate them, so you're gonna, you've done your job when you've done that, according to (crosstalk)Mother Nature . . . 

00:04:14
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay. All right. 

00:04:14
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . whereas the females, what we need to be able to do is to keep helpless infants alive . . . 

00:04:24
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:04:24
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . non-verbal, helpless infants up to about, you know, two years old, we have to be able, as females, to read subtle expressions - verbal, emotional; all kinds of cues - that the infant is communicating to the mom. Now, these are pretty much hardwired in the female. Mother Nature wasn't gonna leave that to just, you know, to our choice. 

00:04:44
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:04:44
LOUANN BRIZENDINE She was gonna hard-wire it in terms of our circuitry, so what happens at birth is that we pop out into this world either with male brains or female brains and bodies, and, you know, if you look at the data coming out right now from the Yale baby lab . . . 

00:05:09
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:05:09
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . which you may know some about in terms of . . . Babies as young as three or four months old are able to look and, and decide whether they know something about justice and injustice and empathy and they become, uh, they, (crosstalk)they, they . . . 

00:05:29
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)This is Paul Bloom's work isn't it? 

00:05:29
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Yes. 

00:05:29
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Amongst others, yeah. 

00:05:29
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)So, it's basically a beautiful work on things that are actually circuitry that cannot possibly, at three months, four months old . . . You haven't, at that stage, taught your children to do or be something or think about whether, uh, someone has overstepped the bounds of justice or, you know, the, the, over right and wrong. There is something that's actually been shown from the baby labs to be built into all of us from the get-go, in terms of human social interactions, all kinds of interactions, so it should really no longer surprise us, Rich, that, that there are many things that are built into us from the get-go and that we start to shape and sculpt those programs that we have as we end up, of course, educating and training our children. That's (ph)in the male and female parts of this. Of course, at one month old up to about two years old, the little ovaries in the girl are pumping out estrogen at the adult female level as the tiny testicles also - actually, they're not so tiny at first; you've seen little (crosstalk)boys' testicles; they're like, like huge, relative to the rest of (crosstalk)him. He's pumping out almost adult male levels of testosterone up to about one year old. We do not . . . We have a term for that. Scientists have a term calling that stage of development infantile puberty. 

00:07:04
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Uh-huh. (crosstalk)Yeah, okay. Hm. 

00:07:04
LOUANN BRIZENDINE We don't (crosstalk)know what it's doing. We don't a- . . . We kind of think of it as the hormonal finishing school for the brain and body. It has . . . 

00:07:14
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)(ph)Well . . . (crosstalk)Okay. 

00:07:14
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)There you go. So the hormonal finishing school . . . You're done by about two years old. We're all . . . Some of that . . . Whatever that finishing that has to happen to us for, are probably something to do with reproduction and pro-creation. It's just, maybe, firming up all of those programs, all of the gonads, as well as the brain, all of the body and brain pieces that have to do with reproduction, so just looking at those little baby . . . All this stuff's going on that, that we are learning about from the baby labs now about programs and circuitry that's already in there to do things that we thought aren't things that we're, we would have until we're 10 or 11 years old. They're already there, okay? Of course, we know we can really mess people up, we can mess children up. I mean, we all treat . . . You know, we can have neglect, we can have child (crosstalk)abuse . . . We can have all kinds of things that don't go right. 

00:08:09
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. (crosstalk)So we have . . . 

00:08:14
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)And that's what a lot of us therapists are doing, but to know that we emerge that way and that the, the one thing in little boys that we know from Eleanor Maccoby's work for 40 years, looking and detailing meticulously what goes in pre-school age children ages three to four and looking at the gender differences in their play, that little boys are, are, do the rough and tumble play. So nine out of 10 boys are, are in the rough and tumble play category. They, they love roughhousing with each other, roughhousing with other boys. They'll roughhouse with, with anybody; you know, with . . . 

00:08:49
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:08:49
LOUANN BRIZENDINE I mean, uncles, the main uncle . . . Your uncles and older cousin's job with you, your boys is to roughhouse with you. (crosstalk)Little girls, on the other hand, like to do something that's called . . . They'll do, sort of, relational play. They'll do, "Okay, you do the daddy and I'll be the mommy" or "You be the doctor; I'll be the patient" (crosstalk)and these role-playing games happen with little girls. Nine out of 10 times, little girls will be that and about 10% of boys and girls end up having behaviors more like the opposite sex for whatever reason . . . 

00:09:19
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. (crosstalk)(inaudible ) 

00:09:25
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)And that's, that's within a normal range. It's important to remember that that's in the normal range. It's not abnormal; it's in the normal range, (ph)so (crosstalk)(ph)just like overlap . . . 

00:09:29
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:09:29
LOUANN BRIZENDINE After all, we're the same species. We've got the same brain. It's more alike than different, but these (crosstalk)we're talking . . . I like to talk about what the differences are, cuz those are the things that cause us difficulties, often, with relationships, intimate relationships, where we get . . . That's where the rub comes, as it were. These little boys and girls, three and four years old, with that type of play, little boys will play that role-playing with little girls for maybe a small amount of time and then they're off and running. "Come on guys! Let's go get them!" I can remember that, you know, when I was an undergraduate at Berkeley, all of us women would talk about how, when we were moms and had (crosstalk)boys we were gonna raise these boys to grow up to be, uh, emotionally competent males and our (crosstalk)future daughters-in-law would thank us for the emotionally competent husbands we raised - all this kind of stuff at 20 - until we had our own boys and we realized, hey, you know, these little boys . . . I mean, you may buy them dolls - I bought my son a doll when he was that age and he grabs her (crosstalk)by the torso and uses her legs as spears! "Come on (crosstalk)guys!" You know? So it's, it's not something that, even if you have the intentionality to try to . . . Howe- . . . So, that, that's important but I, I really give a proviso on this because no one wants to stereotypically anything on, on a little boy or a little girl. You want them to become who they are and use all of their talents, so this issue of math and science and how boys and girls learn differently . . . That's, that's all true, but it's so individual and . . . Of course little girls can learn math and science. You don't wanna tell, (crosstalk)you don't want to tell little boys . . . 

00:11:09
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Mm-hmm, okay. (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)So let, let's, let's . . . 

00:11:09
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Yeah. 

00:11:09
RICH SIMON Let's stay that, keep that for one moment. So (crosstalk)just . . . One of the things that's interesting about your take here is, so there's this evolutionary influence early on that's, that's uh, becomes, that really does stamp and, and, your, your, it's communicated through this, uh, uh, hormonal marinade that you, you like talking about. I think you invented this concept of a hormonal marinade. So that, uh . . . And so the . . . Now the, the, one of the points you make is about little girls, this importance as a mother, this attentiveness to a facial expressions, to voice tones, and this helps this little creature is a primary responsibility of a mother and that part of you are thinking about this difference between the rough and ready or, uh, uh, roughhousing young, young boy, young male child, and with girls is this sensitivity to, if you will, interpersonal nuance, so how is this showing up early on? There's . . . It's . . . Part of this is the role-playing behavior . . . And is there some research (crosstalk)on this? 

00:12:14
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)And also, I think, a lot of adults . . . Yeah, there's a lot of work, there's a lot of works on, work in different preschool groups (crosstalk)throughout there. There's the, the lovely Irish studies and studies, um, Eleanor Maccoby's (crosstalk)(inaudible ) at Stanford, so there's, there's volumes of, of this type of observational, careful, meticulous, if you will, anthropological, uh, observational studies that clearly shows the differences and looking at . . . 

00:12:39
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Uh-huh. And the differences that they're highlighting are . . . 

00:12:44
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Are, basically, the rough and tumble play and the, the girls do this role play and relational play, um, and then, you know, you . . . And there's also a lot of, of, of work on, you know, little, little girls who will, will sit around and basically, they are much, they are much, they're much more interested, often, in kind of the emotional aspects of interactions within the family . . . 

00:13:09
RICH SIMON Hm. 

00:13:09
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . maybe because they're just, they're, they're, they're sitting around interested in that from the get-go and (crosstalk)boys are off, wanting to, you know, they want to (crosstalk)be . . . Nowadays, it's on . . . They wanna be doing shoot-'em-up on their computers. I mean, (crosstalk)that is like the, that is the core of most families in America. If you would just let them play their video games, boys, they will be, they will be quietly happy forever if you let them do that. It's not so great for them, but whatever. So . . . 

00:13:34
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay. 

00:13:34
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . these, these differences . . . All parents notice these differences in (crosstalk)all . . . And the, but the issue of female ability to get on the empathic wavelength of others . . . 

00:13:44
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. Mm-hmm. 

00:13:49
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . uh, is something that's been researched (ph)accor-, uh, by, uh, Baron Cohen in, in England. He's worked a lot on, on the issue of empathy and the issue of mirror neurons throughout the brain. Now, let me just go into that concept a little bit for your (crosstalk)audience because I know mos-, most people have probably heard about them at this point, (crosstalk)but . . . The word mirror is spelled just like you were looking at yourself in a mirror, Rich. So it would be like, um, the way we actually know what we are feeling. Uh, it . . . We, we basically have little, um . . . Between your brain and your facial muscles there's a constant, obvious communication between them, and the way we know, the way I would know if you were sad and the way, you know, most therapists, of course, learn this is, is in ther- . . . I think men who go in therapy automatically have more of an empathic ability. They find that much more . . . So you guys are part of the 10% that are . . . 

00:14:44
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Sure. Uh-huh, right. 

00:14:44
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . that are in the, at least in certain areas, you're in the category of . . . So mirror neurons were first discovered in the F5 region in the monkey brain . . . 

00:14:54
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:14:54
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . and um, it's, it's, it's sort of dispersed a bit throughout the human brain, and just where those circuits and all that is a very high . . . There's a lot of interest in that and there's been research to show that the female brain has more of these mirror neurons or, at least, they're more active and there's . . . It's, (crosstalk)it's not that your . . . 

00:15:14
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Really? (crosstalk)That I hadn't heard. Okay. 

00:15:14
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. So, um, this is sort of out of a whole group of, of, of Chinese studies that have come out in the last four or five years since they're being replicated in various places, so it's a whole area of intense work, but, obviously, male and female brains both have mirror neurons . . . 

00:15:29
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:15:29
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . and so let's be clear that, that males are . . . We're not gonna let you guys off the hook so easily. You guys are capable of, of (crosstalk)lots of empathy as well, but what those mirror neurons do, um - and uh, Tania Singer has done a lot of work with, with some of this and pain and in the scanner - is that, if you look at another person's face and they are sad, what happens to you at a, at a less than one, less than one second level, your facial muscles start to mirror the facial muscles, just very subtly, of that other person, and what that does is it triggers your brain to know what that emotion is. 

00:16:14
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay. Mm. My . . . 

00:16:19
LOUANN BRIZENDINE So the way we know what (crosstalk)somebody else is feeling is by putting our facial muscles into the same level of microexpression . . . 

00:16:24
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:16:29
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . that the other person has, and that is feeding back to our own brain circuits to say "that person is feeling angry; that person is feeling sad; that person is feeling shame," . . . 

00:16:39
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. 

00:16:44
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . so the way we recognize emotions in others is this microexpression mirroring that we do unconsciously that just pops back into our brain and tells you what the other person's feeling. 

00:16:54
RICH SIMON So, so let's, let's stay with this story that you're unfolding here about the stages of the development for the, for boys and girls and how this manifests itself, and so we have the, this, this, uh, what we're, we're, where we are, in that you're telling us about these boys who are more into roughhouse, girls who are more interpersonally attuned, perhaps their mirror neurons are a bit more active early on, and so as we move to four, five, six, seven . . . As we move closer, as we get a little bit older and we, we move into pre-adolescence and adolescence, what are the things that are important to understand about what's happening in the brain of boys and girls and that are triggering, uh, that, that seem to be connected with differences in their behavior this, (crosstalk)about that state? 

00:17:44
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)So one thing that, that teachers have always known is that, that at six, seven, eight years old, boys and girls really prefer to play with the same sex. 

00:17:54
RICH SIMON Mm. 

00:17:54
LOUANN BRIZENDINE They, they, they get . . . And, you know, Eleanor Maccoby has written a book called The Two Sexes, which is brilliant. It's pretty (crosstalk)dense, but it's, it's just brilliant. It's, it's . . . 

00:18:04
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Okay. 

00:18:04
LOUANN BRIZENDINE But basically . . . No. Girls and boys live and grow up in a different culture. You (crosstalk)know, if you grow up often and just, like, hanging out with the guys and . . . 

00:18:14
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Mm, yeah. Uh-huh. 

00:18:14
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . and then guys get . . . They put boys in a group that, if you put them in a group - actually, there are several studies that where they put the boys in a group, they don't know each other and they established a pecking order pretty quickly. They know who's the big, all six of them, they know . . . 

00:18:24
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:18:24
LOUANN BRIZENDINE And if you keep them together, Rich, a year later, even having not seen each other in that time . . . 

00:18:29
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:18:29
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . the pecking order reestablishes (crosstalk)itself almost instantaneously to where it was before. It's fascinating. Girls have a little more fluidity. You know, girls don't like conflict enough, for example, that boys . . . There's a lot of studies coming out in terms of boys' ability to kind of work in teams and negotiate things and they're playing a game and if somebody breaks the rules on the team . . . Boys want to continue playing so much that they will figure out a way to (ph)re-trigger the interaction so they can continue playing. Girls, when there's a conflict, they'll decide they'll stop playing. 

00:19:09
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:19:09
LOUANN BRIZENDINE They leave the game. 

00:19:09
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:19:14
LOUANN BRIZENDINE That's important for therapists to know . . . 

00:19:14
RICH SIMON And you're, (crosstalk)and so you're . . . 

00:19:14
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk) . . . couples therapists, (crosstalk)couples therapists know that. 

00:19:19
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)And the premise here . . . 

00:19:19
LOUANN BRIZENDINE And then . . . (crosstalk)So that's . . . It's . . . 

00:19:19
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)And the premise here is that this is not, this is not socially conditioned behavior, primarily. So we know (crosstalk)that we have gender roles and so on. 

00:19:29
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)Well, the, the . . . All of the premise . . . Okay. All of the premise of all this is that . . . And all, all scientists, uh, psychologists, people who just, just do observations (crosstalk)and then the neuroscientists . . . If you ask both, (ph)they'll (ph)do . . . They will agree, on each side, they think . . . The psychologists think that things are about 50% biological . . . 

00:19:49
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 

00:19:49
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . (ph)50, 50% psychological, or trained and gender (crosstalk)education . . . 

00:19:54
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Sure. Yeah. 

00:19:54
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . and you ask the scientists or the neuroscientists and the bi-, you know, the, the brain circuitry of people and hormonal circuitry, what percentage is psychological and what's biological and they'll say about 50%, 50, (crosstalk)50. So there's a consensus on both sides, even if you're coming from the other side, that the circuitry that we're born with and the hormonal aspects of running it and the biological part is about 50% of the infrastructure (crosstalk)and then how you sculpt it. 

00:20:24
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Uh-huh. (crosstalk)Which, which is way more than when I was in graduate school in, in the heyday of interactional determinism and feminism and other movements that (crosstalk)wanted to really . . . 

00:20:34
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)And Skinner, B.F. Skinner started it, of course. 

00:20:34
RICH SIMON And, and look at the environments. So now, so now, what you're saying is there's, that we've come quite a way since that point (ph)towards, really, these biological pre-dispositions are quite powerful forces and let's not, let's not pretend that they're not (ph)applying. 

00:20:49
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Right. Even, even geneticists. I mean, many people in the culture now are getting their own genomes or doing the, getting the genes for this or genes for that, so even, I mean, geneticists feel that even, whatever your individual genes are, even if you're pre-disposed for some kind of cancer or other . . . 

00:21:09
RICH SIMON Mm-hmm. 

00:21:09
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . that the environ-, if you're an identical (crosstalk)twin, if you're an identical twin, the (crosstalk)same gene . . . If you go to age 60 and look at those twins, you look at the epigenome, the, all the changes (crosstalk)that have been done even in their DNA . . . 

00:21:24
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Turn on the gene, yeah. (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Mm-hmm. Yeah. 

00:21:24
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . in terms of the epigenetic changes, they're quite different at that age and stage, so . . . 

00:21:29
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:21:29
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . what happens to you, what family you're raised in, what's your nutritional, what's your religious, what's your moral values, all of which your character structure ends up being and who you end up being is definitely partly given to you by your infrastructure of your genes, but not all of it. 

00:21:54
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. 

00:21:54
LOUANN BRIZENDINE So I think (crosstalk)we've come closer together from, from (crosstalk)where people were, you know, 20 years ago in terms of . . . (ph)You (ph)had (ph)to . . . That's why I say, my say, my saying is the nature-nurture debate is dead . . . 

00:22:04
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)So now . . . (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so (crosstalk)it's an oversimplification. 

00:22:09
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . because it's the same. 

00:22:09
RICH SIMON Yeah, there's no "either (crosstalk)or." 

00:22:09
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)Nature and then how you're nurtured . . . I-, i-, it's . . . The nurture starts to become part of your biology by the epigenetic mechanism, so, you know, if you eat really health food vs. not, if you're starving, or if you're raised in an environment where you're nurtured or neglected . . . I mean, all of those things make changes in the brain circuitry (crosstalk)(ph)making (ph)the (ph)circuitry . . . 

00:22:29
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)But at the same time, what you're saying and what both of your books really say, and they, they uh, you, it's, you convey it so powerfully, is that this evolutionary script lives within us and this and within the story of each of our lives a kind of script of the, our, the, the biological imperative of, to be the primary caretaker for the next generation, in contrast to the obligation, the evolutionary obligation to, uh, to, (crosstalk)to . . . 

00:23:04
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)To inseminate! 

00:23:04
RICH SIMON . . . to inseminate for the next generation. Those are . . . We can't ignore that; these, these, these drive our behavior in, um, (crosstalk)quite profound ways. 

00:23:14
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)Very important to realize that, and I also think that it has to also a helpful thing for our clients cuz it starts, it helps to normalize some things about their behavior (crosstalk)and their impulses . . . 

00:23:24
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)This, this larger story. 

00:23:24
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Right. I think it's a really an anti- shame . . . 

00:23:29
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:23:29
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . story too. 

00:23:29
RICH SIMON So when we get into this . . . Let's contin-, stay, stay with this developmental story, cuz I, I really enjoy how you tell this (crosstalk)story . . . 

00:23:39
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)Well, (ph)I (ph)take (ph)it through the book from the girl brain to the teen girl brain to the . . . 

00:23:44
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:23:44
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Well, I call it, uh, the meeting chapter, chapter three, in The Female Brain is called, uh, Love And Trust. 

00:23:49
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:23:49
LOUANN BRIZENDINE In The Male Brain it's called Love And Lust. 

00:23:54
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:23:54
LOUANN BRIZENDINE That, that sort of tells the whole story then, and then (crosstalk)of course . . . 

00:23:54
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Well . . . And tell us that . . . 

00:23:54
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)Nobody ever interviews me about chapter four in either book cuz it's about the brain below the belt, so it's all about the, it's all about sex and the two . . . 

00:24:04
RICH SIMON And th-, and they're not interested? I thought that would be the one they would go to immediately, but (crosstalk)we'll ge-, we'll get there also. (inaudible ) 

00:24:13
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)Uh, I think people privately, I think people privately read that one . . . 

00:24:14
RICH SIMON Okay. Well you'll, you'll (crosstalk)tell us whenever . . . Tell us the story, whatever part of the story you, you think is important today. 

00:24:19
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk) . . . to themselves. Right. 

00:24:19
RICH SIMON So, so, uh, so we're moving into the, the adolescent years, and so from your viewpoint, your understanding of the brain, recognizing this, uh, nurture and nature both at work. What do you see? What are these larger patterns that you (crosstalk)think are . . . 

00:24:34
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)You mean as we go into the teen . . . 

00:24:34
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:24:34
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . stage, because, of course, one of the cool things that we do now know is that we kind of think of it the third stage of brain development. So the first stage is in utero, stage one . . . 

00:24:44
RICH SIMON Okay. 

00:24:49
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . and then stage two of brain development is childhood. We used to think it was all over by three years old. Remember that? I mean, by three years old, we're either . . . You're, you're wired for whatever, your IQ points and your this and your (crosstalk)that and your morality or your . . . You know, it's all your character structure, (crosstalk)your personality structure . . . Well, that's stage two now, and stage three is the teen brain, because we know what happens is all of a sudden it's brain growth, actually, that's happening, because with the spurt in the body size and it's also a growth in the brain branching, especially. All of a sudden, this plethora of, like, you go into the backyard (ph)thicket. The brain is (crosstalk)sprouting all these new connections all over the place and what (crosstalk)has happened though is that the hormones of puberty start to intensely run the circuitry for sexual pursuit in the male and, for females, in the sexual attraction. I mean, what females wanna do is they want to attract the male. If you think of all cultures . . . Think of the African tribes, where the girls just can't wait to get the scarification or the stretched lips or the stretched necks or ears . . . You know, that's all . . . Girls can't wait, in those cultures, to (crosstalk)do those things when they're nine, 10, 11, cuz that, that means, you know, that they're gonna be beautiful, where girls (crosstalk)in our culture . . . 

00:26:09
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Uh-huh. (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Uh-huh. (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Uh-huh.(crosstalk)And is that, is this stage . . . You're saying it starts as nine, 10, or 11? Cuz you . . . 

00:26:09
LOUANN BRIZENDINE So the puberty . . . So girls' average age - in white girls, Caucasian girls and in, um, in Hispanic girls - is 12.1 for onset of mensies. For African-American girls, it's about 11, so that means (crosstalk)half, 50% before 11 and 50% after, so teachers know that, you know, if you've got nine year old girls in the, you know, African-American girls, 10 year old girls, so that's usually by third or fourth grade you've got a bunch of girls who've already gone into puberty . . . 

00:26:39
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay. (inaudible) 

00:26:44
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . so it's a really important thing to kind of, to also to know and to help (crosstalk)parents with, and then boys, the onset of puberty in boys we measure . . . The first wet dream is 13.5, so (crosstalk)that means that all that part of your machinery, as a boy, is, is (crosstalk)working, so whenever I talk to teenagers or seniors in highschool classes I sometimes talk, get invited to talk about this. I'll have the boys . . . I'll say, "Okay, how do we know the girl goes into puberty? What age is that?" The boys all raise their hand. "The period, the period!" the boys say, and then I'll say, "Well, what age . . . How do we know that . . . What do we know is the indicator for boys going into puberty?" 

00:27:19
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay, yeah. (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Uh-huh. Uh-huh. 

00:27:19
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Dead silence. 

00:27:19
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:27:24
LOUANN BRIZENDINE You know? And then I say, "Well, it's the wet dream at 13.5," and the boys are about ready to crawl under the (crosstalk)table. 

00:27:29
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)"Oh dear! You're blowing our cover! You're telling (crosstalk)our secrets here!" 

00:27:34
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)"That's right! That's right!" So the . . . But the, but the . . . That means all the machinery is (crosstalk)working and the machinery needs to get rid of the semen and the sperm at that stage and, anyway, that's, that's when boys go behind closed doors, moms, moms stop the . . . Moms feel upset cuz their boys have stopped talking to them at that stage. They're behind closed, locked doors like they need to be. At any rate, so that's the stage for, for boys, and so to look at the onset of . . . I'd say the (ph)puerile brain, his brain is going into puberty about a year before these events happen, a year to 18, 12 to 18 months, so if the girls average 12.1, body goes into puberty . . . As soon as you look at a little girl and you see those little breast buds, you know, you start to see tiny little breast buds, a little body fat around the nipples, that means estrogen is acting on her body, but it's also acting on her brain, so if you just see that as Tanner Stage 1 - pediatricians call it - that is the stage at which girls' brains have started to go into puberty . . . 

00:28:34
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay. Okay. 

00:28:34
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . which a lot of moms . . . They already know it cuz there's a few crabby day, crabby days (crosstalk)(inaudible ) . . . 

00:28:43
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)And so what does that mean, in terms of behaviors? So what would be the brain is (crosstalk)in (inaudible ) . . . 

00:28:47
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)So all of that circuitry that has to do with wanting to attract the opposite sex or wanting to try and, you know, to be attractive or wanting to be more social and wanting to even notice the opposite sex . . . Remember, they've been using these . . . Boys and girls have been living in the company of same (crosstalk)sex at this point and (ph)they're (ph)only (ph)little same sex cultures and tribes and then all of a sudden they get more interested in each other, right? These poor, a poor guy . . . The first guy out of his group that gets a girlfriend, you know, he basically just, you know, he's conflicted, cuz is he gonna go with the guys, and so are girls are conflicted. They gonna stay with the girls or go off with their boyfriend, (crosstalk)you know? I mean, just look at the text messaging from . . . You know, girls just wait forever to get that text message back from the guy, you know? They could care (crosstalk)less about the girls. 

00:29:34
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Different cultures, the different tribes. (crosstalk)Yeah, yeah. (crosstalk)And so the cognitive capacities at this (crosstalk)age for boys and girls? 

00:29:39
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)So those . . . The sprouting of all of these brains are . . . The hormones are going wild and making all of this growth happen, but reinforcing the tracks for sexual function, sexual interest . . . It's not the media that's wanting to get them to buy things to look more attractive or do make-up or hair or whatever it is . . . They want to do what's, by their culture standards, and setting the culture standards for attractiveness . . . (crosstalk)Unfortunately, that's where you start to get anorexic cuz someone calls somebody fat and, you know . . . 

00:30:09
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. And these tendencies can be exploited and intensified in the, in the 50 fiftiness of life, but it, it's there. They're building (crosstalk)on something that's built into us. 

00:30:19
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)It's very much there and it feeds back on the brain circuits, but the brain circuits are already there, you know, for having the hormones surge, having this happen, having these behaviors happen, and one of the things that's im- . . . I mean, parents already know this, but therapists . . . You know, the, the I . . . Being able to not tell your mother something, you know, is really an important sort of . . . You know, this . . . It's, it's a bifurcation of wanting to be much more independent and strike out on your own. This is, this is all an un-, a natural, a normal, unfolding, step by step, of the developmental circuitry of the brain. It's all in your . . . It's all about how your, how your genes, your nutrition, the environment plays out and how the brain is controlling, by the pituitary, the stimulation of your gonads to be making huge amounts of estrogen and testosterone and progesterone for girls, (crosstalk)and mostly testosterone for boys. 

00:31:19
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)So from the, from the science of this, the . . . So, so we can measure differences in hormonal levels at different ages. Can we see differences in how the male and female brain operates? Do we have functional MRI studies that show us . . . 

00:31:34
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Yeah, so we, so we (crosstalk)do have how these things, and especially, you know, uh, (ph)J.G. Donnethy and IMH has basically looked - starting at about three and a half years old - and he's measured this same group of boys and girls. I think, maybe, he's up to the early 20's now . . . 

00:31:49
RICH SIMON (crosstalk) . . . something? Mm-hmm. 

00:31:49
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . in looking at the major differences and the similarities in which there are whole areas of brain circuitry that are different in the boys and the girls. I mean, back to the . . . They're more alike than they are different, Rich, of course, but (crosstalk)it's this whole areas that are lighting up and are, are larger and more active in the males and larger and more active in the females, so there are these differences there. They don't know exactly what they're all doing but they seem to be largely related to their reproductive function; you know, (crosstalk)finding a mate, finding a mate, taking care of helpless infants, interest, interested in how other people, emotionally, are feeling, you know, and, you know, how, how to get a girl to go out with you. I mean, all of these things that are going on are, are, are programs that are just unfolding in each of our, our youngsters. 

00:32:39
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)Okay. But there's an evolutionary program within the nervous system, whatever the, the . . . 

00:32:44
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Yeah. 

00:32:44
RICH SIMON . . . social conditioning and the different ways different cultures either try to . . . 

00:32:49
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Yeah. 

00:32:49
RICH SIMON . . . encourage or, or contain, (crosstalk)you know, their . . . 

00:32:49
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)Even the girls in the burkas, right, even the (crosstalk)girls that are all covered up . . . 

00:32:54
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. 

00:32:54
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . they have, they have little ways, and, you know, they have little ways of, like, signaling to the opposite . . . They're going by in all (ph)tho- - as they call them - the black tents all walk by, but you see, (crosstalk)like, one girl will have a, they'll have a little, uh, cartier watch. I mean, even in Saudi Arabia, where they have, you know, all the money in the world, the girls will have just, some little something that they start to be able to do at the (ph)ting to signal to the boys that it's . . . They have all these little signals. So it doesn't matter what (ph)you (ph)do (ph)to (ph)them. How . . . You know, I guess in India, they lock up the girls, at 14, in a little hut and they don't let her out, (ph)but (ph)there's (crosstalk)some . . . 

00:33:24
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Sure. Uh-huh. 

00:33:29
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . there's some, some of your, um, listeners may know more about that, but there's a (crosstalk)whole culture . . . 

00:33:34
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)So what's the next stage here? So we, we've moved through this adolescent stage of (ph)stirm and (ph)drung and very intense pre-occupation with sex and the opposite sex and our attractiveness and, and so where, where does that, where does that go? What happens between (crosstalk)16 (ph)into (ph)the (ph)60's, like you and I are? 

00:33:54
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)So 16 and 22 . . . So . . . By about 15 or 16 most of our identities, a big chunk of our identity about, about who we are, what kind of effect we have on others and boys, very much, the pecking order of, like, you know, how . . . Basically, are you, are you gonna be an alpha male and, you know, these, these things are really, uh, not completely formed, but they are the, the outlines of them are there, you know? Michael-Angelo still has to come along and chip away at fine-tuning this big chunk of . . . But we . . . So identity formation is all happening in the midst of this explosion of brain circuitry, and how you reinforce this . . . I think one of the things that, as a culture, we have not come to grips with and do not do as well as we should is that that stage of adolescence, age 12 to 16, is a time at which we should not abandon our young people that are that age, because you have the biggest chance to make an impression on helping to shape their identity, who they are, whether they feel they're a good person, how they can be helpful, how they can be, you know, part of the community, you know, and, and, and clipping the wings on some of the more, like, like, nefarious behaviors. I mean, it's a really important time to have things like girls and boys clubs or to, you know, scouting, whatever it is as a culture that we, we, we cannot abandon our, um, ex-, the explosion of the hormones is driving them to look like adults and, often, to talk like adults, but they are not adults. 

00:35:34
RICH SIMON So what's the next step here? So we . . . You're, you're saying, you're saying 15, 16, so we move into 17, 18, 19 . . . What's the difference between a young person's, a, a boy or a girl at that age and what, what we've been seeing just a few years earlier? 

00:35:49
LOUANN BRIZENDINE So there a couple of interesting things about the ma-, male-female differences in the brain, the things that we know. The girl's brain seems to be pretty much finished with its stage three of brain development, by about age 19. Boys don't finish up 'til they're 21, 22, you know, so there's still some modification . . . So they're a few years behind, but we know that, right? I mean, that's not news to anybody, but we now know it from the brain, the brain scans (crosstalk)telling us about how . . . 

00:36:19
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)And what does that mean when you're saying their . . . What isn't finished? What is it that (crosstalk)we . . . What's the difference we see? 

00:36:19
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)So, so I think a lot of your group is probably . . . You know, if you took your thumb and you pushed it in above your ears about that far into your brain at the tip . . . 

00:36:29
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. 

00:36:29
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . you have an area called the amygdala . . . 

00:36:29
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah, and we know a lot about the amygdala in our (ph)field (ph)these (ph)days. 

00:36:34
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)A, A M Y G . . . (inaudible ) Amygdala is like, means almond in Greek. Whatever. And it's where the emotion, the, that's, that's the hot spot for emotions in the brain, like . . . 

00:36:39
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:36:44
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . like, like anger, aggression, flight or fight, fear . . . All kinds of thing, and that's, that's going, like, wild when you put the hormones . . . Especially testosterone starts to run that amygdala . . . You know, the explosive, angry, you know, aggress- . . . You know, you said something wrong to your son and he's, like, off the charts by that time. He just snaps and that (crosstalk)behavior may continue for four or five years and mine has just gotten through that - thank God . . . 

00:37:09
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah, okay. And I, and I can testify to that. Quite, quite a, a (crosstalk)lovely, impressive young man. 

00:37:14
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)Yeah, that's right. You just, you just, you just saw him. He was my tech help here (crosstalk)and he, he's gotten, you know, he's gotten . . . So, the . . . So it's that the amygdala is like this red-hot that's, that's spewing out all the emotions throughout the circuitry in the brain, and, remember, the frontal lobes in the front, behind our foreheads is where all of the parts that are fine-tuning and making ability to predict what the, what the outcome of your behavior might be, what the, what your, what the risk of doing a certain thing might be to your future . . . You know, basically, discernment and, and fine-tuning, uh, the emotions that are . . . That is coming . . . The stuff from the amygdala is like, just overwhelming the (crosstalk)frontal lobes of your 13, 14, 15, 16 year old, pretty much. By 19, the girls have gotten those areas connected up and they're able to have some - what I call - of the brakes. The f-, the, the frontal lobes in the pre-frontal cortex they will equip some brakes on the input from the amygdala and (crosstalk)those brakes can work on . . . 

00:38:19
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah, (ph)Whit-, Whitney, yes. (crosstalk)Overwhelming them, okay. (crosstalk)From, from the emotion, from the excitement from fear, from anticipation . . . 

00:38:24
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Yeah, so it's, it's about 19-ish in females that the brakes from the frontal lobe have stopped, finally gotten fine-tuned and strengthened, if you will . . . 

00:38:29
RICH SIMON Yeah. 

00:38:34
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . and boys don't hit that 'til they're maybe, like, in their 20, 21 stage. They also go into puberty later, so they're just shifted a bit for reasons we don't understand. You know, car companies haven't let kids rent cars until they're 25, so the thought, thinking is that all (crosstalk)parts of the brain are like they're hooked up enough to rent a car by the time we're all 25, (crosstalk)unless you wanna pay an extra (inaudible ) . . . 

00:38:57
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)(ph)Inertia. So this is an area where whatever, whatever expectations we might have about our young people - here's, in terms of the nature-nurture balance . . . Does the brain simply is not ready, is not able to regulate emotion at . . . 

00:39:09
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Right. 

00:39:09
RICH SIMON . . . at uh, 17, 18, way it is, it will be a few years later and that, that there is a difference between, uh, boys and girls, young, young men and young women in regard to that. 

00:39:19
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Yeah, one of the things that we also know that's very interesting just in terms of how that, you know, at the puberty stage, um, of 12 or 13, but starting maybe age 10, 11, the kids need to, teens' brains need to sleep more, by an hour or two at night, so at 10 years old, you may need less sleep than you need at 13 cuz your brain . . . All the growth hormone is being released at night. There's lots that's going on at night with brain development, so you need to let (crosstalk)teens sleep and there's a, what's a chrono-, chronobiological shift to going to bed later and later and later. It's not just because the media is available. That's bad too, but . . . So boys get shifted more than girls, in terms of the lateness, and therefore, boys get up a little later; girls are able to go to bed a little earlier and, and that chronobiological split between male and females that's been (ph)tracked returns to being the same at about age 50 to 55 years old . . . 

00:40:24
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. Okay. 

00:40:24
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . but after the menopause so . . . And it has something to do with hormones. And, of course, the hormones are decreasing in the males by that time and in the females too, by that time. We don't know exactly why, but this, this need for sleep and the chronobiological shift . . . And it goes back, in the mid 20's, to being, to going to being able to go to bed a little earlier and get up a little earlier, but we should not start highschool until 10 AM. If you're a highschool teacher, you should not want to be the 8 o'clock teacher. 

00:40:54
RICH SIMON Yeah, yeah. (inaudible ) So now it's . . . So, at this point, so at 19 in girls, 21, 22 in boys, so what is the, what, what's - in terms of this unfolding development, this story that you've been telling us - what is . . . So is . . . Are we . . . What happens at that point? What, what's that brain stage, once we've passed that threshold (crosstalk)depending on whether we're . . . 

00:41:14
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)So we're kind of in the mating and dating stage at that point, so in our culture . . . I mean, in other cultures, you've already s-, been selected your mate or something by the time you're 15 or 16 or 17 you're often having your first children. 

00:41:24
RICH SIMON Sure. 

00:41:24
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Um, if you just let it run how nature, Mother Nature (crosstalk)planned it, right? 

00:41:29
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Right, and that's changing. People are, (crosstalk)uh, getting from our culture . . . 

00:41:34
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)So we've shifted that later and later and later. I guess, you know, women aren't having babies until they're 40 now, as (crosstalk)long as you freeze, freeze your eggs, you're okay, (crosstalk)but so that whole biological push to mate, choose your mate and start, you know, that part of your life . . . We delay that a lot with education, etcetera, etcetera, but . . . So in the (ph)twen-, early 20s, um, the, the mating-dating game is in full force. That's, that's sort of, you know . . . Females are trying to attract the males; the males are trying to search out the, you know, the best (crosstalk)females they can find. 

00:42:04
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)So it's, it's a brain development? Is there something . . . So you've described up to this point . . . And maybe that's where most of us get, where you have some ability to regulate your emotion and you're not so much at the mercy of whatever your, your fear, your longing is. 

00:42:19
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Your amygdala. You're not at the mercy of your amygdala. 

00:42:19
RICH SIMON The amygdala's (ph)going (ph)on . . . So in terms of brain development what's, what is the next step for us? Then are we, basically, okay, you're about as grown up as you're gonna be? Go forth and, (crosstalk)you know, (ph)hold (ph)apply, if that's what your . . . 

00:42:34
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)Your identity, your identity is mostly formed and you're (crosstalk)trying to finish up with your education and you're starting to do that (crosstalk)phase . . . 

00:42:39
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)So, from the point of view of the brain, are we pretty much fully formed at, at that point in our (crosstalk)lives and you're . . . 

00:42:44
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)Right, and (crosstalk)so girls, for example, they'll have . . . So, remember, testosterone is the hormone that gives sexual interest in girls and boys and females end up with about one-tenth of the amount at conspecific ages all along the life cycle, so even though females have one-tenth, we get a lot of bang for our buck, you know? We get our sex drive, our sexual interest, as it were, (crosstalk)and at age 19 girls have the highest, uh, highest testosterone that they'll have in their lives, the highest (crosstalk)(ph)averages that they'll have in their lives. Boys have theirs at about 21, 22, so they're peaking at that stage, so the peak of, like, just pure-on sexual drive, uh, and males start to . . . Then, of course, the females have been going the menstrual cycle and the first week of the cycle, remember is before you ovulate, so you only have the estrogen. You get the big waves, every month you get the estrogen waves going up. That actually causes, by the way, Rich, the little area which is for what we call working memory in the hippocampus, not the hippopotamus, but the hippocampus . . . 

00:43:49
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Okay. Okay. 

00:43:49
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . that's where a lot of the estrogen causes 25% more sprouting every month than that first two weeks of the cycle and then progesterone comes along at (ph)ovulation, and it's like pouring weed killer on all those connections and sprouting that the estrogen's caused to grow. That pruning and . . . Every single month you've got this 25% increase and then this decrease. We don't exactly know why that is, but it really keeps that area of the female brain constantly prepared for - we don't know exactly why or what, but it's definitely constantly in preparation - for, for taking on new things, somehow. If you don't, of course, get impregnated at that stage you end up starting another menstrual cycle, and, of course, females have so many more menstrual cycles now than we did in the year 1900 because in 1900 females were pregnant 15, 16 pregnancies, so there were lots and lots of times during the female's life cycle where she didn't have the menstrual cycle going up and down, and so the female actually probably has changed in some interesting ways that we haven't quite . . . The research on that is very, very new. It's very, very difficult to do, and, of course, most research in brains and in biology is still done in males, even to this day . . . 

00:45:24
RICH SIMON Really? 

00:45:24
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . so the human male is the, used as the (crosstalk)model for hu-, the norm, and, unfortunately, lots of the . . . You know, it's, it's, it's done for various reasons but, but the FDA . . . You don't wanna cause any harm to some fetus or some female that's pregnant that you're using in your clinical trial, so even in studies, even if they're supposed to be using females to figure out what it does in females, they're not used in most clinical trials (crosstalk)(inaudible ) . . . 

00:45:51
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)The normative standard. (crosstalk)Let me ask you: what is it . . . If, if . . . What do we know about sexual orientation and the brain? What . . . Have we discovered something? So is . . . Where . . . Is, is there, um . . . Are . . . Do we have different brains? Are straight people and gay people . . . Are they have a different wiring? Is there some stage in life where brains begin to, there's a differentiation in, in the brain function? What . . . Is this an area where (crosstalk)(inaudible ) . . . 

00:46:21
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)So . . . Right. Back in the 90s, early 90s, Simon LeVay thought he found the place in the brain that was gonna make it a gay brain or not and whatever because of doing lots of autopsies on gay brains versus straight brains, and then they basically found out that all of that data had to be thrown out because most of the autopsies in that stage, in the early 90s, that they had been doing gay males who had died of AIDS, so they, they had to throw, so . . . And then they tried to replicate it and it didn't work out, so there is no center in the brain that we think of anymore as being what makes you gay or not. However, the, the thinking currently is, is that you are, you emerge from the womb with a gay or straight brain, and that would be the (crosstalk)(ph)unfolding . . . Yeah. So that . . . But you . . . And then the natural increase during puberty of becoming (ph)op-, interested sexually in the opposite sex . . . If you're gonna be same-sex attracted you become sexually interested in the same sex. So it unfolds at this, the normal developmental stage of all humans, in, during puberty, your interest, your interest, your sexual interest in either opposite sex or same sex happens at that stage, so the gay brain, if you will, is, is, at birth . . . It's not something that happens; it's not some moral decision you make at age whatever-it-is. It unfolds normally in there, so, um, most same-sex attraction starts during, during puberty. Um, sexual interest in the opposite sex or same sex unfolds in the same kind of way. Now, what is known, and in both of the books I have an appendix that's called . . . One is The Female Brain And Sexual Orientation; the other one is The Male Brain And Sexual Orientation. I tried to include everything that we currently know and accept biologically, um, that, that are different, and the hormones aren't different; the circuitry, as far as we can tell, at this point, because of, we have a very, we're at a very primitive stage of neuroscience, so we just, we really do not know, but, things, for example, that point out some of the differences . . . There's a very nice study out in Sweden that scanned the brains of straight and gay males why they were smelling the pheromones of the opposite sex or the same sex, so the gay males' brains lighted up in the pleasure centers when they were smelling the pheromones of another male, but if they smelled the pheromones of the female, they, that was not attractive to them, whereas the straight males, the straight males really, um, liked the smell of the pheromones of the females, but they did not like the pheromones of the, of the male, so there's, there's something at that basic sort of even pheromonal level, (crosstalk)which is biological that, that we know about, so that's as far as we've gotten with those (crosstalk)studies, um, (crosstalk)so it's important to know that we've got some . . .You know, there's some genetic changes we can born in. You can have a male brain born in a female body or a female brain born in a male body. 

00:49:34
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Really? (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)So, so . . . Yeah, so what's . . . What do we know about that? 

00:49:39
LOUANN BRIZENDINE So um, for example, we . . . There's a condition called congenital adrenal - meaning the adrenal glands - congenital adrenal hypertrophy, so in the, while the fetus is growing, the adrenal glands, in people that have that genetic condition, the adrenal glands start to pump out huge amounts of testosterone, which is no big deal to the males right? Their testicles are already pumping out plenty. However, in the females, since this condition has got these adrenal glands pumping out huge amounts of testosterone, as if they were testicles, and it's marinating the female brain in the male hormones, in the testosterone, so they're born with a male brain. 

00:50:29
RICH SIMON So this is the experience of people who come into life and, from early on, they feel like they do not, they're in the wrong body. (crosstalk)So there's, there's a brain foundation to this. 

00:50:39
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)Yeah, this, this group has been studied a lot. There's a lot of studies on this group of what's called (ph)condrena-, the CAH girls, and I talk a lot about that in the, in the section I go about talking about that in the female brain and in the first chapter of the birth of the female brain, cuz they end up being more tomboys, they do rough and tumble play. Actually, about half of them end up same-sex attracted, so they end up lesbian, but half do not; they go on to, um, have children and live in heterosexual marriages, so it's not . . . There's no purity in the . . . So (crosstalk)that's one condition. And in males, there's something called AI. It's an, it's an (ph)ince- . . . There's no receptors for testosterone in these males, and so when the big, the tiny testicles start pumping out huge amounts of testosterone in that eight week old male fetus he doesn't, his brain and his body don't have any receptors for the testosterone, and so his brain doesn't change to a male brain, so he's born with a female brain in a male body . . . 

00:51:39
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. Okay. 

00:51:44
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . so those . . . You know, you've seen some . . . There's some beautiful work. You know, Alan Greenberg and, and Barbara Walters did, uh, Goldberg and Barbara Walters did a beautiful piece that was done on, I think, uh, 20/20 a number of years ago. They got uh, they got lots of prizes for that piece they did on, on um, little boys who knew they were, that started dressing in little girls' clothes at a young age and little girls . . . So that, those are things that we know about and they st-, they stand out to us - they're very rare - but they stand out because it also highlights to all of us the gender expectations and the (crosstalk)expectations of which, which sex you are in our culture. It's so . . . We know what sex we are before, at the same time, often, we know our own name, so it's so (crosstalk)much a part of our identity formation at a very young age, and these little boys who are born with female brain and want to dress in girls' clothes, they also know, as part of their identity, that they're a girl, (crosstalk)somehow. Uh, each . . . I think it tells you so much, robustly, about the, the robustness of the biology and the (crosstalk)hormones and the way the circuitry is. 

00:52:54
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Sure. (crosstalk)Uh-huh. (crosstalk)Yes, yep, yep. (crosstalk)The biology. So let's . . . We, we have about, uh, five minutes or so, so let's, let's make sure we, we complete the, the journey here, so we're, we're, we were, um, a few moments ago we're talking about . . . So we have the 19 year old girl and they're moving into a time of life where, culturally, people are pairing up, they're getting their careers together, they're at the age where, at least, they're beginning to consider getting married. Men, uh, it's a slightly older age. So, in terms of brain development and moving through your 20s into your 30s, before we move into these more later stages, is there, of life, is there some significant change in brain development that is important for us to understand as therapists? 

00:53:49
LOUANN BRIZENDINE In terms of that stage, at the 20s, (crosstalk)sometimes 30 . . . 

00:53:49
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)(ph)And (ph)sort (ph)of, in moving . . . Yeah, or that big chunk of life. So we had . . . Uh, these are all the developmental stage and you've taken us to that certain point where there, we have a bit more balance, many of us, in our ability to deal with our amygdala and our emotions and, and (crosstalk)our, uh . . . 

00:54:04
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)So all this stuff is just kind of playing out, like, (ph)feed forward, basically, and the thing, the times I start seeing girls in my clinic - uh, young women in their mid 20s and things, I start seeing them when they starting having, um, PMS, or premenstrual (ph)dysmorphic disorder, when their hormones are causing emotional distress or they (crosstalk)getting anxious or they . . . We call it, in my clinic, the Crying Over Dog Food Commercials Sign. 

00:54:24
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Uh-huh. Uh-huh. They're crying over dog food . . . 

00:54:29
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Commercials. 

00:54:29
RICH SIMON . . . commercials. 

00:54:34
LOUANN BRIZENDINE You know, it's . . . I can see you're don- . . . 

00:54:34
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Oh, you're getting . . . I see your . . . "Why am I feeling so upset?" 

00:54:39
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)The females, females, females will connect, females can really connect with that statement, if you've (crosstalk)ever had it, and it's . . . You know, (ph)really (ph)speaks (ph)to (ph)the women . . . You have this feeling . . . All of a sudden you have a day, a 24 hours where you're feeling like anything just hits you (crosstalk)as being emotionally (crosstalk)evocative. At any rate . . . But, also, females, lots of girls will also - if you're in a relationship - you start to have, sometimes, fights or interactions at that time that are not very good. I've had men want (crosstalk)me to program something. Their cell phones, it, like, gives them a, like the, a ring tone that's different on those days to . . . 

00:55:09
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay, all right, I'm . . . I'm crying. (crosstalk)Okay, okay. (crosstalk)All right, I gotcha. (crosstalk)Right. (crosstalk)Right, (crosstalk)watch out. 

00:55:09
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk) . . . indicate, remember today is the day you're supposed to be extra sensitive, right? So, at any rate, so I start seeing those things, and, of course, during the, um, I start seeing the post-partum depressions and the depression and anxiety during the pregnancy, so things that (crosstalk)start to happen for females during that life stage . . . 

00:55:24
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. Yeah. 

00:55:29
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . that has to do with their hormonal cycles affecting their brain circuits. (crosstalk)That's what I basically do in the Women's Mood And Hormone Clinic at UCSF, Langley Porter. All, all week long, that's who I see, and so we can fix those things or help ameliorate them and treat them in ways that are helpful to, um, also to their psychotherapy. I mean, psychotherapy is the, is probably the mainstay of what we recommend from my clinic, actually, cuz it's really, really helpful to have psychotherapy as well as the hormonal adjustment or whatever medication. We use a lot of the SSRIs cuz it helps treat PMS, you know, we can use . . . So we get those fixed up and we basically send them back to their psychotherapists to continue working on how to integrate some of those things into their relationship lives. 

00:56:14
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay. So at the . . . We just have a few minutes now. So here's the, the last piece of it: so, as therapists, what is it about the brain . . . So much of it, I think, in this very lively panoramic tour you've given us of the brain development from the earliest moment of conception on through adult life, uh, that, that, that's clearly something that's a good thing for therapists to, to know and to understand . . . Is there, is there, as we come to the come to the end here, if there are any thing in particular, uh, that you really wanna highlight for this therapist audience about understanding brain development and also gender differences with the brain that is, uh, that perhaps we haven't touched on so far? 

00:57:04
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Well, I think, maybe, what I would give to them is that, as, as you know, in having read The Male Brain book and The Female Brain book, it's written all through stories, and so no one (crosstalk)has to know any science to read that. I wrote it for my patients. They kept asking me to please give them, you know, like, give them a book that helps to describe this, (crosstalk)so I've never thought it was gonna be me that was gonna end up doing that, but, so that's how I got involved in writing The Female Brain for my patients, so it's, it's a very lively story orient- . . . You don't even know that you're reading any neuroscience, but by the (crosstalk)time you finish it, you actually have learned a lot of neuroscience . . . 

00:57:34
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Yeah, uh-huh. Yep. 

00:57:34
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . cuz it's part of the whole process, so . . . (ph)I'm (ph)gonna (ph)say that, lots of times, the couples therapists, they'll take the female brain and give it to the guy and take the male brain and give it (crosstalk)to the male and say, "Go home and read and come back next week and we'll, we'll (crosstalk)talk more. I think it's a way of actually pulling the couple out of the, this, you know, their, pulling them, letting them step into the other person's shoes. The way, the way I describe the female (ph)raiding the male brain is that it lets her see the world through male- colored glasses for a day . . . 

00:58:04
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Yeah. (crosstalk)Yeah. Mm-hmm, right. 

00:58:04
LOUANN BRIZENDINE . . . and the male, the same thing. It lets him see the world through female-colored glasses for the day that, that, that helps them sometimes, like, cut the other person a little slack, right, (crosstalk)on, on some things, so that would be, that would be my, the thing I would leave your audience with (crosstalk)to help their, to help their clients out, uh, the most with getting out of this gridlock of, like, like, the blame game that, that I see in my office a lot. 

00:58:29
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Right, yeah, okay. (crosstalk)Okay. So if people want to find out more about your books, about your work, where do they go? 

00:58:34
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Um, they can go to, uh, thefemalebrain.com or louannbrizendine.com. It's (crosstalk)a, it's a website that has a lot of, a lot of information on it. Uh, I think that the best way to start is reading, you know, the male or female brain book and, and hopefully in a few years I'll have one out on the, the uh, the next sequel will be on the mature female brain, so for all of us women who are going from 60+ on, I'm wanting to go for that, that uh, that age group that's uh, a (crosstalk)group (inaudible ) . . . 

00:59:07
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)And what about the guys? Are you, are you gonna, are you gonna be helping us out as well? 

00:59:09
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)Well I'll, I'll take you guys along too. Yes. (crosstalk)You guys, like, you guys have (ph)fallen behind. It'll be a little pamplet, a little pamphlet on the, the male brain. 

00:59:14
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay, we could use some help. Okay. 

00:59:19
LOUANN BRIZENDINE No, we get, we get a lot more in common by the age of 60 and we're not so, we're not, we learned a lot of to not point the fingers at the others so much and to give the other person a little slack by that age, right? Which . . . 

00:59:29
RICH SIMON Well, on a good (crosstalk)day. 

00:59:29
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)And I just wanna say something to you, personally: I just think that the work you're doing and you've been doing out there with getting information and having been at one of your conferences a few years ago in D.C. Um, you do a fabulous piece for all of the therapists that are out there and really trying to keep it vibrant, fresh, and new and just really integrate for all of your, uh, therapist network, how to bring things into the office to help out your clients, so (crosstalk)thank you for that. 

00:59:59
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)That's . . . Well, you've, you've helped that cause along wonderfully here today, so thank, thank you. And so, um, I, I wanna invite, uh, the audience for this conversation to participate in it. You'll see a comment board on your screen. If you have questions . . . But mainly if you just have some comments, you have something that you learned, there's . . . I learned all kinds of things. What a, what an interesting and, and uh, provocative tour of male and female development, so I cannot imagine too many people who did not respond to that, so share with the rest of us for your, for your own sake. Just put it down so that you remember it, um, and please join in the conversation. We'll send Louann the comments that folks put up on the comment board. If she is so moved, she will respond. We'll see. Uh, and . . . But this is, this is clearly a conversation (crosstalk)that's an important one. 

01:00:54
LOUANN BRIZENDINE (crosstalk)Or they can come to my Facebook page that I have, actually (crosstalk)called, um, uh, Louann Brizendine, MD, and I have lots of dialog with people on that page (crosstalk)that they can ask me questions on the Facebook page so we can go back and forth. It's a lot of fun. A lot of people have a lot of questions. 

01:01:09
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Okay. (crosstalk)Fabulous. That's right. Well, Louann, again, I, this, it's so much fun to talk with you. Worlds open up as you describe your work, um, good, you know, God bless you and the work that you're doing, um, and thank you so much for taking the time to share your work with us here this afternoon. 

01:01:34
LOUANN BRIZENDINE Thanks so much for having me. 

01:01:34
RICH SIMON So here we are at the end of this conversation. We look forward to seeing you next week as, as this exploration of Neuroscience In Action continues. For now, goodbye, from Rich Simon, here at networker webcasts. Bye-bye.
