L. Leong Abigail Q. Billington Katherine M. Giuca MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY 

00:00:20
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG I am Fred Leong, Professor of Psychology at Michigan State University and the Editor of the “Asian-American Journal of Psychology”. It’s my pleasure to bring to you, a paper that I have been working with some doctoral students at Michigan State on Cross-Cultural Competencies. Let me do the introductions first, and then we will each of the three presenters take about 10 to 15 minutes to present, and then open it up to comments from our distinguish discussing, and then have plenty of time for questions and discussions with the audience. So, Abigail Billington is the doctoral student in our Organizational Psychology Program, it was she who initiated this paper which we have been working on for about a year when I talked the course in Managing Cultural Diversity in Organization and got to talking about cross-cultural competencies and the problem that we have been struggling with in terms of lack of attention through criterion problem to what extent cross-cultural counseling competencies produce different types of outcomes in the clients, and then Katherine Giuca who joined the program recently, joined us on the research team, and so we have been working on this paper which we hope to get comments from you on and submit and also from Professor Sue. We are very fortunate to have Dr. Derald Sue who is Professor at Teachers College, Columbia University to be out discussing as many we know he is the lead person in developing the Position Paper, which is start of this Cross-Cultural Competencies Movement and have gone onto produce many of the landmark publications on Cross-Cultural Competencies. So, we are pleased to have him ah… react to our paper. So, without further due let me give the background, and then hopefully turn it over to Abi and Kate to talk about our Critique and Research Recommendations. Okay, we are gonna give you a history of the Cross-Cultural Competencies Movement, discuss some definitional issues, and then move to the recent advances in the field, and then our recommendations, and then open it up to Dr. Sue’s comment, and then group discussions. So as you know the Cross-Cultural Competency Movement came about as a result of multiple factors as Patricia Arredondo, one of the key players in that had noted in the historical review. First the formation of various Ethnic Minority Psychological Associations, which were in reaction to being marginalized by the American Psychological Associations. To this day we are still struggling, we are trying to get Ethnic Minority Psych(ph) Association seats on the council of APA. At the same time, you have the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which empowered African-Americans, which led to reforming of ABPsi, the Association Of Black Psychologist and followed soon after that by the various Ethnic Minority Psych Associations. But now today form a council of the Ethnic Minority Psych Association, that is actually meeting at the end of this meeting here at the council all the national Ethnic Minority Psych Associations for the advancement of ethnic minority issues. But actually, the pivotal development is the virtue… 

00:03:20
History: Cross-Cultural Counseling Competencies • A pivotal development was the publication of the 1982 Position Paper on Cross-cultural Counseling Competencies in The Counseling Psychologist which introduce the AKS Model: Awareness, Knowledge, and Skills. • This position paper was based on a Task Force initiated by Allen Ivey as President of APA Division 17 and chaired by Derald Sue. • Sue, D.W., Bernier, J., Durran, M., Feinberg, L., Pedersen, P., Smith, E., & Vasquez-Nutall, E. (1982). Position paper: Cross-cultural counseling competencies. The Counseling Psychologist, 10, 45-52. 

00:03:20
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG …which was published in The Counseling Psychologist to develop the AKS model; Awareness, Knowledge, and Skills. This Position Paper came about as a result of the Task Force initiated by Allen Ivey who was then President, Division 17 Counseling Psychology and chaired by Derald Sue and his colleagues in this reference that you see there. What was unique about the model was that it was based on the comprehensive review of the literature at that time and formulated into this three dimensional model of Awareness, Knowledge, and Skills. That the Awareness component involved a culturally skilled counseling psychologist who is sensitive to his or her own cultural heritage, looking within coming to terms of once on racial identity and so forth, an issue that was still struggling with in terms of our(ph) impact of our own cultural identity on our clients and the therapeutic process. But that is only the beginning and that of course one is acquire cultural specific knowledge about the clients that we were working with who are culturally different from us whether it be understanding the history of slavery in this country to continue institutional racism and so forth, and the institutional barriers that comes forth. But knowledge in itself is not sufficient in that the Position Paper in the (inaudible ) that say we actually have to through practice come up with the skills these verbal nonverbal response and so forth that are culturally appropriate in terms of like when I teached a course on Cross-Cultural Counseling in Psychotherapy. I talk about cultures that are high context versus low context communication style, because psychotherapy is so much in the western culture focus on verbal exchanges. So over the years, the AKS model has gone through expansion, elaboration that we don’t have time to go into, but essentially this included development of measures of these Cross-Cultural Competencies, further articulation and specifications of these competencies beyond the 82 Position Paper. Next, I’d like to move to some definitional issues very quickly. I think part of the problem with the Cross-Cultural Counseling literatures, there has been some confusion of the constructs. There has been tendency because of the history of multicultural education to conflate the terms Multicultural Counseling with Cross-Cultural Counseling. As I pointed out that, these are different concepts and they are more appropriate to be used for their own context. The reason that we use the term I think Multicultural Counseling is because it comes under term many cultures, multi-cultural, because of the Multicultural Movement in United States. There is Multi-Cultural Education, we are pluralistic society and so forth, so when counselors began talking about the work they to do, they simply transposed the term and started talking about multicultural counseling, which is not really appropriate when you are counseling somebody from another culture is really Cross-Cultural Counseling or Intercultural Counseling where Paul Pedersen would say in his model on Intercultural Competencies. Most recently(ph), I think we have been using the term Intersectionality, that we have the intersection of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation. So, I think that’s a more appropriate use of the term that we try to… try to understand what are the dynamics in counseling some would use African-American who is also gay, those are the intersections of race and sexual orientation. But that really we need to be careful about the use of term Multicultural. Because we only counseling person from a particular culture and we need to go to the literature I think it’s much more appropriate to use the term Cross-Cultural Counselings that we know what cultures we are referring to and what literature we need to refer to and so forth. 

00:06:45
Multicultural vs. Cross-Cultural Counseling • The more appropriate term is cross-cultural counseling since it accurately describes what they do – a counselor from one particular culture is counseling a client from a different culture. • Multicultural counseling, on the other hand, means counseling with many different cultures and this is rarely what counselors and therapists are doing unless they happened to be conducting group psychotherapy with a culturally heterogeneous group of clients (i.e., counseling with many different cultures). 

00:06:45
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG Of course occasionally, we will do group counseling, in which clients come from many cultures and in that case, virtually doing multicultural group therapy or counseling. 

00:06:55
Multicultural vs. Cross-Cultural Counseling • A second and more important reason why we should not use the term multicultural counseling in place of cross-cultural counseling is the nature and extent of our knowledge-base. • The majority of the studies that have examined the role of culture and its potential influence on counseling and psychotherapy have been bi-cultural, i.e., it has examined and compared only two cultures. • Multicultural studies (study of 3 or more cultures at the same time is relatively rare in the counseling and psychotherapy literature). 

00:06:55
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG A second and more important issue is the, the knowledge-base as I mentioned in that. In Cross-Cultural Psychology we make a very specific reference to whether it is a multicultural study, a bi-cultural study, or monocultural study. As you know, much of American Psychology is monocultural. We study White European-Americans, and then we assume that is generalized put to the others. But then, Cross-Cultural Psychology came in and began a whole series of bi-cultural studies where we had compared United States to compare to Japan or to Nigeria, and so those are bi-cultural studies. The Holy Grail in Cross-Cultural Psychology is of course these massive, multicultural study like Hofstede has done in which, he looks that work values across 40 some cultures. Those are truly the multicultural studies, that forms the knowledge-base in which we can say based on Hofstede data… 

00:07:40
Multicultural vs. Cross-Cultural Counseling • We need to recognize and acknowledge this methodological dilemma (i.e., multicultural studies are best but too expensive for most investigators to undertake) and that much of the knowledge-base on which cross-cultural psychology in general and cross-cultural counseling in particular is discussed and debated is derived mainly from bicultural and not multicultural studies. • This predominance of bicultural studies (only two cultural groups) is also true for racial and ethnic minority psychology. 

00:07:40
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG How is Nigerian is different from Singaporean is different from Japan and so forth. So, we have a field in which the predominance of our cross-cultural literature is bi-cultural and that’s where we add in terms of being limited and we need to be grounded in the empirical database. So, we talk about when we get to evidence-based practice. A second definitional problem has to do with cross-cultural competence and cultural competence and once again, I think my point here is then every person being socialized into the own family and own culture and so forth are already culturally competent. It’s just that white European-American therapist are culturally competent in the white European culture. They lack cross-cultural competence. So when we conflate the term and say we need to develop cultural competence. They don’t need cultural competence when we talk about working with white European-Americans. What they need are cross-cultural competence, and that’s important because… 

00:08:40
Multicultural vs. Cross-Cultural Counseling • A second definition problem has to do with the concept of cultural competence versus cross-cultural competence. • Most White-European American counselors and psychotherapist have always been a culturally competent psychologists. • To be culturally competent is to be able to adapt and function effectively in one’s culture. • In the same way, African American counselors and psychotherapists are also culturally competent psychologists with reference with their African American cultural heritage. 

00:08:40
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG …cross-cultural competency for white European therapist who work with African-Americans are different set of competency to work with a Vietnamese, so we need to be very specific about cross-cultural competence for a specific group and we shouldn’t ignore the fact that they are already very culturally competent in working within their own culture. So that’s the gist of these slides. Part of the problem with the multicultural competence versus cross-cultural competence is that the cultural competence that they already have is not that the problem is that they are not culturally competent. The problem is that they don’t realize that they only have cultural competence in working with their own culture. They don’t realize their own Eurocentric orientation, and that’s what we need to work on and that they need cultural competence in terms of working with other cultures, across cultures. It was the cross-cultural competency that needs to be developed, not cultural competency in working with their own cultures. So once again, this is the gist of the slides in terms of working within cultures versus across culture and I just wanted to make sure that we use the terms appropriately. So, let me turn now to Kate Giuca can talk about critique. 

00:09:50

00:09:55
Critique • While the field of cross-cultural counseling competency (CCC) has come a long way, there are a couple of areas where the field could still improve, mainly in its: 1. Measurement, and 2. Methodology 

00:09:55
KATHERINE M. GIUCA So… Sorry while the field of cross-cultural counseling competency has come a long way as Fred has explained, there are couple of areas where the field could still improve, mainly its measurement and its methodology. A variety of assessments have been developed to measure across cultural counseling competency in recent years including, but not limited to the multicultural Awareness, Knowledge, Skills survey, the cross-cultural counseling inventory revised, the multicultural counseling inventory, the multicultural school psychology competency skill, and the multicultural counseling Knowledge, Awareness, Skill. Current methods including the once that were mentioned before for assessing cross-cultural counseling competency suffer from a number of issues including disagreement over the definition of the construct, the format of measures, and the need for more rigorous constructs validation procedures for assessment instruments. 

00:10:55
Critique – Measurement • Current methods for assessing CCC suffer from: - Disagreement over definition of CCC – Format of measures – Need for more rigorous construct validation procedures for assessment instruments • After over 30 years of research, there is still little consensus regarding the definition of CCC • Without agreement on the definition of the construct, it is not possible to decide which scale is best suited for measuring a person’s level of CCC 

00:10:55
KATHERINE M. GIUCA After over 30 years of research, there is still consensus regarding the definition of cross-cultural counseling competency. Without agreement on this definition, it’s not really possible to decide, which skill is best suited for measuring a person’s cross-cultural counseling competency. 

00:11:10
Critique – Measurement • Most CCC research traces back to D.W. Sue et al (1982)’s paper stressing the need for a focus on CCC counseling – Provide a list of characteristics necessary for CCC that compile three dimensions: • Beliefs/Attitudes, • Knowledge, and • Skills 

00:11:10
KATHERINE M. GIUCA Most of the research as Fred has mentioned dates back to D.W. Sue et al’s paper in 1982 on the need of for a focus on cross-cultural competency where you provided the three dimensions that were explained before. 

00:11:25
Critique – Measurement • While many conceptualizations of CCC have been based on the this paper, a number of other definitions have also been offered: - S. Sue (1998) • Scientific mindedness • Dynamic sizing • Culture-specific expertise – Constantine and Ladany (2001) • Counselor self-awareness • General knowledge about multicultural issues • Multicultural counseling self-efficacy • Understanding of unique client variables • An effective counseling working alliance • Multicultural counseling skills (p. 490) 

00:11:25
KATHERINE M. GIUCA While many conceptualizations of cross-cultural competency have been based on this paper, a number of other definitions have popped up in recent years including S. Sue’s three dimensions of scientific mindedness, dynamic sizing, and cultural specific expertise. Constantine and Ladany’s 2001 paper that talked about counselor self-awareness, general knowledge about multicultural issues, multicultural counseling self-efficacy, understanding of unique client variables, effective counseling working alliance, and multicultural counseling skills. 

00:11:55
Critique – Measurement • Kataoka (2005): none of the current scales match the original three dimensions D. W. Sue et al. (1982)’s paper proposed • Debate exists over the correct number of dimensions – MCI: 4 factors • Multicultural Counseling Skills, Multicultural Awareness, Multicultural Counseling Knowledge, Multicultural Counseling Relationship (Sodowsky, Taffe, Gutkin, & Wise, 1994) – MSPCCS yields a one-factor solution (Kitaoka, 2005) – MCKAS: 2 factors • Knowledge/Skills and Awareness (Kitaoka, 2005) 

00:11:55
KATHERINE M. GIUCA In 2005 Kataoka talked about how they will compare the bunch of the different scales and they saw that none of the current scales really matched the original three dimensions that D. W. Sue proposed and since then, debate also exists over the correct number of dimensions. For example, the MCI has four factors, the MSPCCS has one factor and the MCKAS has two factors. 

00:12:25
Critique – Measurement • Kocarek, Talibot, Batka, & Anderson (2001) compared the reliability and validity of the MCAS, MAKSS, and GSEDS (scale that measures graduate student competency with diversity) – Found that each of the scales “seem to be measuring different aspects of the constructs or slightly different constructs altogether (p. 494) 

00:12:25
KATHERINE M. GIUCA In 2001 Kocarek et al compared the reliability and validity of the number of different scales and found that each of the scales seem to be measuring different aspects of the constructs or even different constructs altogether. 

00:12:35
Critique – Measurement • A number of authors have criticized the format of many of the assessment measures of CCC (Pope-Davis & Dings, 1995; Constantine & Ladany, 2001; Kocarek, et al., 2001) – Mostly self-report • e.g., MCKAS, MCI, MAKSS (Kitaoka, 2005: Sodowsky, Taffe, Gutkin, & Wise, 1994; D’Andrea, Daniels, & Heck, 1991) – A few use outside raters • MCPSCCS (training directors; Rogers & Ponterotto, 1997) • CCCI-R (supervisors; LaFrmboise, Coleman, & Hernandez, 1991) 

00:12:35
KATHERINE M. GIUCA This makes a kind of difficult to pick which scale is best suited when you don’t know, which definition each scale leads to, because there is no agreed upon definition. Another criticism of the field has been that the format of many of the assessments and most of them are self-reports including the MCKAS, MCI, MAKSS. A few have used outside raters, however, including MCPCCS, which looks at training directors rating and the CCCI revised, which is supervisors. Alternative methodologies have been suggested such as rating of counselors by clients and S. Sue also proposed two measures that are effective predictors of successful counseling outcomes, including cognitive match, which is similarity between client therapist explanations for the client problems and assessing similarity between client and therapist at culturation level. 

00:13:30
Critique – Measurement • Problems with self-report: - Measures intentions and not actual behavior (Constantine & Ladany, 2001; Pope-Davis & Dings, 1995) – Can be influenced by social desirability (Constantine & Ladany, 2000; Sodowsky, Kuo-Jackson, Richardson, & Corey, 1998) • Significant relationships between CCI-R, MAKSS, MCI, and MCKAS and social desirability (Constantine & Ladany, 2000) – Raters may interpret scale items incorrectly (Pope-Davis & Dings, 1995) 

00:13:30
KATHERINE M. GIUCA What are problems with self-report? The main problem with self-report that has been cited is, that it measures intentions and not actual behavior. So, counselor may stay… stayed on one of these surveys or forms that they intend to be very culturally minded in their counseling. However, when it actually comes up in a situation, this behavior might not actually be exhibited and so it might not actually be an accurate predictor of that kind of behavior. Furthermore, it can be influenced by social desirability. Obviously, it’s socially desirable to be cross-culturally competence, so self ratings may be inflated. Significant relationships have been found by Constantine & Ladany between the CCCI revised, the MAKSS, the MCI, and MCKAS for social desirability. And finally readers may interpret scale items incorrectly and thus rate themselves incorrectly. 

00:14:30
Critique – Measurement • Alternative methodologies: - Portfolio Assessment Method (Coleman, 1996) • Participant compiles a portfolio exhibiting competency across a number of CCC domains • Is evaluated by a supervisor or instructor • Offers assessment across a range of demonstrated abilities, but is time-consuming and more difficult to evaluate • A number of authors have called for the use of multiple assessment methods simultaneously (Constantine & Ladany, 2001; Pope-Davis & Dings, 1995) 

00:14:30
KATHERINE M. GIUCA Alternative methodologies that have been proposed include the portfolio assessment method, which kind of works like how Art students will have a portfolio assessing their competency in number of different areas in-depth, across different domains and it’s evaluated by supervisor or an instructor. The pros of it is that it offers assessment across a range of demonstrated abilities rather than intentions. The cons are that it’s time-consuming and it’s difficult to evaluate. A number of authors have also called for the use of more than one assessment methods simultaneously to kind of counteract these pros and cons of each method. 

00:15:05
Critique – Measurement • Most scales have been tested for construct and criterion-related validity (Kocarek, et al., 2001; Pope-Davis, Reynolds, Dings, & Ottavi, 1994 • Need for more rigorous validation procedures for assessment instruments (Ponterotto, 1998; Sodowsky, et al., 1994), particularly for: - Predictive validity (Constantine & Ladany, 2001; Kocarek, et al, 2001; Leong, 1998; Ridley, Mendoza, Kanitz, Angermeier, & Zenk; 1994; S. Sue, 199), and the 

00:15:05
KATHERINE M. GIUCA On the measurement side also scales have been… while scales have been tested for construct and criterion-related validity, there is need for more rigorous validation procedure for assessment instruments particularly for predictive validity or the ability of each of the assessments to predict performance outcomes that are desired such as client improvement as a result of this and the degree to which measures are equivalent or interchangeable. So, we have all these different scales, but we don’t know how similar they are in predicting these kinds of things. One of the only study is to look at the relationship between scores and performance was Constantine & Ladany’s 2000 paper, which compared to CCCI revised… 

00:15:45
Critique – Measurement • One of the only studies to look at the relationship between scores and performance was Constantine & Ladany (2000) – Compared the CCCI-R, MAKSS, MCI, and MCKAS with a measure of multicultural case conceptualization ability • “a counselor’s ability to (a) comprehend and integrate the impact of various cultural factors on a client’s presenting issues and (b) articulate an appropriate treatment plan for working with a client based on the knowledge (p. 156)” – After controlling for social desirability, none of the scales accounted for significant variance in multicultural case conceptualization ability 

00:15:45
KATHERINE M. GIUCA …the MAKSS, the MCI, and MCKAS with a measure of multicultural case conceptualization ability, which is defined as the counselor’s ability to comprehend and integrate(ph) the impact of various cultural factors on the client’s issues and also to articulate an appropriate treatment plan based on the client’s, the knowledge of the client. After controlling for social desirability, the authors found that none of the scales accounted for significant variance in multicultural case conceptualization ability. Now, there can be two main conclusions drawn from this, either that each of the scales doesn’t really have great predictive validity. It doesn’t predicts the desired outcomes or it could be that multicultural case conceptualization ability is that authors even suggested may not be the best outcome measure and perhaps there are other better… better measures such as client improvement, client satisfaction, etc. 

00:16:45
Critique – Measurement • Criticism of the methodology of CCC research has revolved around two primary areas: - Method design – Selection of research samples 

00:16:45
KATHERINE M. GIUCA On the methodology side, there are two main areas of criticism including the design and the selection of samples. 

00:16:50
Critique – Methodology • Zane, Hall, S. Sue, Young & Nunez (2003) point out that there is a lack of variation in method design – Use of analogue studies that simulate treatment sessions – Reliance on student samples rather than actual clients • Restricted range – students are often more acculturated – Short time frame – focus on a single treatment session instead of a series of sessions • All of these lead to issues in the interpretation and generalization of research findings 

00:16:50
KATHERINE M. GIUCA Zane et al in 2003 point out that there is a lack of variation in the method design. The methods usually use analogue studies instead of actual treatment sessions. They rely on students samples rather than actual clients, which can be an issue because there is often restricted range. Students of ethnic minority populations may not be representative of the population overall. They maybe more acculturated because they are in school, there are a lot of factors that may make them not perfectly representative. Also, the short time frame of many of these studies, they focus on a single treatment session rather than a series of sessions. All of these lead to issues in the interpretation and generalization of the findings. 

00:17:30
Critique – Methodology • Zane et al (2003) also noted issues with the selection and generalization of data based on samples in the literature – Samples often don’t cover the range of diversity within any given ethnic or minority group • The authors found that few studies specified the specific samples utilized – Small population of minority groups makes it difficult to obtain an adequately large sample for each group – Difficult to find participants 

00:17:35
KATHERINE M. GIUCA Also, the authors noted that selection and generalization of data based on samples in the literature, there are few issues including samples often don’t cover the range of diversity within a given group. So, within a group, there may be subgroups that are very different from each other. The authors state that a lot of articles don’t specify the specific samples to utilize it, it’s difficult to tell whether they are representative of the overall group. Also, since by definition, a minority group is a small group, there aren’t many people in it. It’s difficult to obtain an adequately large sample for each group, so it’s difficult to find participants. 

00:18:10
Recent Advances in the Field 

00:18:15
[sil.] 

00:18:20
ABIGAIL Q. BILLINGTON Hi! I am Abby, okay. So, in addition to reviewing the literature on cross-cultural competence as we are trying to develop our recommendations for the field, we also decided to step outside of the field and look at the broader field of counseling and even psychology in general and recent trends and see if they can inform our recommendations. And so, there were two trends that are actually very interrelated. Umm… that we want to just briefly touch on, evidence-based practice in comparative effectiveness research, both of which are borrowed from medicine. Okay. So what is the evidence-based practice movement? Most of you are probably familiar with it, but just as a review, the purpose is to use the best available evidence to improve patient outcomes, which is really a key and I’m going to touch on that again. Okay. 

00:19:10
What is the Evidence-based Practice movement? • Goal: use best available evidence to improve patient outcomes • APA: integration of best research with clinical expertise – Efficacy: causal relationships – Clinical utility: feasibility in specific context 

00:19:10
ABIGAIL Q. BILLINGTON The APA Presidential Task Force on evidence based practice defined evidence based practice in psychology as the integration of the best available research with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture and preferences and one way that APA has sought to encourage practitioners to be consistent with evidence based practice is through the development of best practice guidelines, in 1995, and then it will place them with the criteria for evaluating treatment guidelines in 2002 and both of those documents really emphasized two main dimensions of determining best practice, efficacy and clinical utility. So where as efficacy refers to the strength of evidence regarding causability or the cause or relationship between the specific intervention and therapeutic outcomes. Clinical utility refers to feasibility and includes such things as characteristics of the patient, specific characteristics of the therapist and their abilities and even things like cost. So, why is evidence-based practice so important now? Ah… well this has really been developing in the past decade especially or even 15 years, but why the new push(ph), well APA and other professional organizations have now written documents that include the use of empirically supported treatment and that which I am going to cover in a minute, an evidence-based practice as important for ethical conduct. They really mandated in fact for ethical conduct. And then in addition, outside of the field, third parties such insurance companies and health maintenance organizations are increasingly requiring counselors to use empirically supported treatments in order for payment. Ah… Okay. So, obviously, there are… are a number of limits to evidence-based practice that I want to cover… 

00:21:05
Why is EBP so important now? • Why now? • Requirements (external and internal) to use EBP for better practice • But can also be limiting, so need good research 

00:21:05
ABIGAIL Q. BILLINGTON …very quickly especially in terms of a practitioner in a counseling practice. 

00:21:10
Concerns about EBP • EBP versus empirically-supported treatment • Most evidence is about efficacy NOT clinical utility • How might EST evidence differ from EBP? – Sample – Treatment – Outcome 

00:21:10
ABIGAIL Q. BILLINGTON Okay. So, a number of researchers have made the distinction between empirically-supported treatments and evidence-based practice. Empirically-supported treatments are more specific type of evidence-based practice. There interventions or techniques that have been linked to desirable outcomes in controlled studies. Whereas, evidence-based practices are broader term that includes issues of clinical practice and clinical utility and so if you compare the two terms, they mere very well, APAs two dimensions are of best practice, clinical utility and efficacy. Whereas empirically supported treatment would demonstrate efficacy alone. Okay. And as you are well aware, most of the evidence, the research evidence that we have in the field is about efficacy and doesn’t include a lot of issues about clinical utility and so counselors who attempt to do best practice and follow best available evidence maybe limited, because the evidence is mostly about efficacy and less so about clinical utility. So, I’m not going to cover this in great depth, but how my empirically-supported treatment evidence differ from evidence-based practice in general. Kocarek(ph), in 2008 talked about three main dimensions and which have may differ; patient, treatment, and outcome. So, some examples would be for patients, generally patients in controlled studies are selected because they meet the criteria for a very specific disorder and so they may have less severe disorders or a few are co-morbid disorders for example and they also choose to participate in research, the motivations to participate in counseling maybe different than patients that you’d find in other clinical practice. Treatment is relatively standardized in control studies, which may differ from how counselors practice and generally consists of sessions of a fixed number in duration and it’s limited to treating the specific symptoms that the patient comes to, is selected for the study or comes to counseling for initially and not add… adds on his more things are discussed. I mean in terms of outcomes, the goal of controlled study is the reduction of specific symptoms when clinical practice that maybe the reduction of angst or general overall feeling of wellbeing. Um… in addition, just to touch on it, the outcomes, the criteria for success in controlled studies may not necessarily translate into practical meaning for patient’s, so in terms of statistical significance as how we decide if a treatment is effective in a controlled study and statistical significance is valuable, yet we still don’t know how statistically different numbers and rating scales translate to real life behavior changes or attitude changes. It’s also worth on getting this point that there is a very little research, evidence-based practice research that looks at ethnic minorities at all. Okay, includes them in the populations. So, an even more recent term now is comparative effectiveness research, which compares at least two treatments rather than one treatment with a control to decide which treatment is more effective in leading to better outcomes. 

00:24:40
Comparative Effectiveness Research • Compares at least 2 treatments (not 1 treatment with a control) in terms of which leads to better outcomes • Outcomes include both effectiveness and utility 

00:24:40
ABIGAIL Q. BILLINGTON And these studies also include clinical utility issues such as cost or other contextual issues, which is not something is often included in typical controlled studies of efficacy. Okay. So, I’m going to back to these at the end, but just in summary, evidence-based practice is increasingly important in the field. The two main dimensions that APA refers back to, are efficacy in clinical utility and making decisions about best practice. Um… we are lacking in evidence at this point for clinical utility and a way to get there maybe with comparative effectiveness research. 

00:25:15
Summary • EBP is important – Efficacy and clinical utility – Lacking in evidence for clinical utility – Lacking in comparative effectiveness research • If going to use EBP, need more better and broader research • EBP and cultural competence 

00:25:20
ABIGAIL Q. BILLINGTON Of course, if you are gonna use evidence-based practice, we need better and broader research. And I’m going to come back in a few moments to talk about how evidence-based practice can inform our studies of cross-cultural competence, specifically with the criterion problem. Okay. So, we’ve developed a set of recommendations, for the field based on our review. The conceptual critique that Fred presented about the definitional issues, there are methodological critique that Kate presented about measurement and methodology of research and then the evidence-based practice in compared of effectiveness research. So, we have four main areas, on which we make recommendations for the field. The first has to do with construct specification. The second developing and expanding the criteria used in the studies in the field… 

00:26:10
Four Areas for Improvement • Construct specification • Criterion development and expansion • Methodological improvements • Focus on process issues 

00:26:10
ABIGAIL Q. BILLINGTON …then a set of methodological improvements, and then we want to move towards focusing on process issues. 

00:26:15
Construct Specification • Go back to developing definitions 

00:26:15
ABIGAIL Q. BILLINGTON Okay, so just a little bit more specifically, construct specification. As Fred really discussed already, we need to go back to developing definitions and really think about what it means, what each the measures that have already been developed, we need to go back and think about what they are really measuring and how they differ from one and another, and then take that into account when we make inferences from those measures. In addition, in the future, we need to be very careful about going back to the definitions and as I’m going to discuss in a minute, considering the outcome or goal as we developed those definitions instead of focusing necessarily just on therapist characteristics. Okay. So, some examples of the questions that we would asking going back to the definitions, what are the dimensions as Kate talked about the definitions that we have including number of different dimensions with different names, although they overlap quite a bit. There are some fundamental differences and we need to go back and consider them. Another issue that Fred actually touched on is… is cross-cultural competence, culture specific or cultural general? Are there are specific competencies that only relate to working with clients from specific cultures? Or is there just a general set of competencies that indicates that or if somebody has those that they are more capable of crossing cultural boundaries with people of any culture? And then, how are cross-cultural counseling competencies are different from general counseling competencies? Is a competent counselor already somebody who can cross-cultural, bridges for example. And also how is it different from just cross-cultural competency in general, how is counseling competency different? Okay. Okay. So, of course, we would suggest developing measures based on those definitions and be clear about differences between the measures. 

00:28:10
Construct Specification • Go back to developing definitions – What are the dimensions? – Culture-specific or general? – Different from general counseling competency? • Develop measures based on those definitions • Be clear about differences between measures 

00:28:10
Criterion • “Criterion problem” • Very few studies measure outcomes • Outcomes need to be expanded • Predictor measures should be developed with specific outcomes in mind 

00:28:10
ABIGAIL Q. BILLINGTON Okay. So, then the criterion problem is really what we were initially interested in and so that was kind of the need(ph) of our project and we decided to expand it. But, the basic idea is that criteria related validity evidence includes both when we are studying it, includes correlations with future performance and correlations with other theoretically related constructs. So, when research on a construct has proceeded without concern for what the proper outcome or criterion is, we call that the criterion problem and the issue in this literature is that I think we would all agree that the main criterion of interest here is that, is patient welfare and patient wellbeing in a variety of related ideas, but in general when the measures that we use now are developed. They took mostly into account therapist characteristics and they weren’t necessarily developed from the beginning with the idea in mind of what is best for the patient and what will lead to patient, desirable patient outcomes. Um… Okay. So, just as an example, in 2008, D'Andrea and Hackman reviewed multicultural counseling outcome research from 1967 to 2007 and they found only 53 studies that met their criteria for inclusion of outcomes of counseling services. But to give you an example, not one of those 53 studies included cross-cultural counseling competency or whatever term you want to use for that, as an outcome or as a predictor. All of these studies included as an outcome. So, it really hasn’t been linked in the literature so far okay. Um… of course, we are already having a rich literature in… in psychotherapy about desirable outcomes for patients and there are variety of different examples, that are not necessarily self-report. So for example, utilization rates, premature treatment termination, length of treatment. Then of course ratings by, I will go into this a little bit, but ratings by clients, ratings by therapists, ratings by family members, or other people outside. Okay. Okay. So, very few studies measure outcomes. Okay. 

00:30:25
Method • Move beyond self-report – Outside raters (including client) – Mutli-method – Trace • Expand Design – Comparative effectiveness – sample 

00:30:25
ABIGAIL Q. BILLINGTON Next, these are really, already really discussed the methodological changes that we suggest by especially moving beyond self-report, as she discussed a lot of the measures seem to be at least somewhat related to social desirability, um… not in a… we are not suggesting that counselors have malicious entire(ph) in rating themselves higher than they want to by, it’s hard to rate your own behavior in general. Um… and so some suggestions would be to use outside raters in addition to self-rating. Different methods that we combine or trace methods such as the examples like premature treatment termination like anything. Okay. And then, to expand the design, this goes back to the idea of comparative effectiveness research where we compare more than one intervention to see if one is more effective than the other in certain context rather than just deciding if a treatment is statistically significantly better than no treatment. And then, of course to consider the sample, there are all kinds of different issues such as samples that agreed to participate in research projects, maybe inherently different than samples that generally go to counseling or and also of course in with issues of an ethnicity we need to be careful to include a broad range of different populations and within each population to consider the new onsets of each… within each of their population. Okay, and then our final recommendation, we are hesitating a little bit to include this because we think it’s more the future of the field. Um… and it may not quite be there yet, but we really need to be looking at the mechanisms and active ingredients of change and why the predictors and outcomes aren’t(ph) linked. So, how does cross-cultural counseling competency impact patient outcomes and therapist outcomes and why, not just does it impact outcomes. Okay. So, here is the idea. 

00:32:20
Process • Mechanisms and active ingredients of change – Why is cultural competence important? How does it impact outcomes? Predictor ?????? Outcome 

00:32:20
ABIGAIL Q. BILLINGTON At this point, a lot of the field is really focused on the predictor. We have some great measures that there has been a lot of work with so far. We still don’t know very much about how they predict outcomes. And then this the idea of process is finding out why those predictors would then would relate to outcomes. Okay. 

00:32:40
Conclusion • Define cultural competence • Measure outcomes • Expand design • Study process 

00:32:45
ABIGAIL Q. BILLINGTON So, in conclusion, we have four main suggestions. The first one is to go back to the definitions, then to consider outcomes, patient welfare, expand the design, and move towards the idea of studying mediators and moderators in the form of process. Thanks.

FREDERICK T. L. LEONG Thanks Abby. Now, we get a chance to hear from Professor Derald Sue. 

00:33:10
DERALD WING SUE Good morning everyone! I really would like to thank and comment Fred, Abby , and Kate for their most interesting, scholarly and enlightening presentation. I’m especially impressed with their ability to articulate the major issues regarding the development and the history of the Cross-Cultural Counseling Movement in itself. They, to identify the definitional issues confronting the terms multicultural and cross-cultural counseling to advocate for clarity in defining cultural versus cross-cultural competencies to explicate the limitations in the multiplicity of methods that we have been using to try to assess and measure multicultural or cross-cultural competency to indicate actually that after a 30 years of research, we still continue to have problems defining. I think what multicultural or cultural competence in essence is and to in some sense recommend, I think importantly four areas in the improvement based upon their conceptual critique, methodological critique, and recent advances in… in counseling researches especially that associated with evidence-based practice. You know as a discussion, I think all of you should be very sympathetic to me in terms of how I am going to respond to each of these points that they have given. Because each point would take really an entire session for me to talk about and elaborate, but part of the advantages of being discussing is that I can pick and choose the easy points to concentrate on and indeed I think that I have decided to really comment on issues of their paper, which I hope will be published, because it’s going to generate, I think a lot of interesting debate in the field. But what I’d like to concentrate on are what I see as philosophical differences that I have with the content and origin and concept of what they are talking about and some recent research in terms of the area of implicit, explicit bias that now really inundates the feel and may say that what we are talking about in terms of cultural or cross-cultural competence, may… we may be missing the point completely in terms of the potential outcome and if you bear with me… together across the philosophical difference and I might have with the panel is I would like to share with you, two evolutions in my own thinking that have occurred. Many of you may be familiar with my book “Counseling the Culturally Diverse: Theory and Practice”. One of the things that it was not originally, that was not the title of the book. The title of the book was “Counseling the Culturally Different: Theory and Practice” and while the first three edition use that, you know title, I consistently felt uncomfortable with the title, because at some point, and it wasn’t until the fourth and fifth edition that I chose to change ”Counseling the Culturally Different” to “Counseling the Culturally Diverse” and it is because I began to ask the question different from what and it always fell back to a default(ph) standard of different from a Western European concept so that even the label and the term are undermine the thought of what I was trying to create and do. The other thing that I would like to share with you is, that in essence when I began early in my career to would be expose the cross-cultural counseling or cross-cultural communication literature. If you look historically back to pre 1980, cross-cultural counseling was applied primarily to internationals, to foreign students and even with Paul Pedersen who broke the barrier, moving into cross-cultural counseling, I began to ask to myself, is it applicable to counseling a cross-cultural counseling applicable to specific racial ethnic populations in the United States and again it was the term foreign students that began to gau(ph) me, because we never considered any students born and raised in the United States who went abroad to be foreign, they were never called foreign students and again, there had an ethnocentric label that was associated with what I was going on. In fact, I have moved away from the use of foreign students now to talk about international students or students overseas and again it is a hidden invisible ethnocentric value system that occurs. In 1980 when Allen Ivey appointed me to chair the Professional Standards Committee to develop cross-cultural counseling competencies, I felt I was as Gilbert Ran(ph) talked about encapsulated. While I was challenging the universality of the theories of counseling and psychotherapy, I was owned also trapped by the definition of cross-cultural competency, cross-cultural counseling competencies, a term that I seldom use now. If you look at all my writing, it deals with multicultural counseling and therapy. It deals with concept of cultural components, not cross-cultural competence. Although I hear, you know I know and understand what many of my colleagues are meaning when they talk about cross-cultural competence. Now, why did I make that switch? Now, I made that switch after beginning to look at in the early days, this led me to explore the history of the term cross-cultural communications or generally what my international brothers and sisters dealt with what they called international, I mean intercultural communications that historically began to involve when people like Richard Brislin, Paul Pedersen began to adopt this international prospective into the Mental Health Movement and corded cross-cultural counseling and therapy. However, the term cross-cultural communications, cross-cultural adjustment, and its derivatives in the mental health field are loaded with historical ethnocentric bias. The terms that are used here and I would like to read to you what com… were common definitions of what cross-cultural communications and counseling were. Here is one that Richard Brislin and Mumford(ph) used and state in terms of what cross-cultural communications is. Cross-cultural refers to individual contact and interaction, professional, and/or social between people who are clearly (inaudible ). They must have different skin color or speak a different language or come from different ethnic backgrounds. Well, I think that in terms of cross-cultural counseling, we might um… um…, you know, in terms of talking about multicultural counseling and therapy, we might agree yes. That seems very consistent with how we would define it. However, they make the following statement that seems to be characteristic of the field of cross-cultural counseling. Although, it is recognized that people can have cross-cultural encounters within their own country. In general however, cross-cultural refers to a crossing of national boundaries or overseas functioning. I want you to really note that, that in some sense that the term cross-cultural communications historically and cross-cultural counseling as a derivative deals with international or national boundaries in terms of the crossing and indeed it led to an avoidance of talking about a social-political elements domestically that I call rightly belongs in the field of multicultural counseling. The off suit of the term cross-cultural is actually related to preferred historical usage of intercultural. These forms and their translations were developed primarily by white professionals in the social sciences, political heads of states and people in the business sector who trained employees or intermediaries to function internationally. Examples are the department of state, the peace core(ph) was (inaudible ) up to developing there is whole field of cross-cultural communication and counseling, the Foreign Service Institute, the U.S. Navy and multinational corporations such as Bectel(ph), Ran(ph), General Motors and so forth, who in essence dealt with this area of cross-cultural communications. The intent of cross-cultural training and cross-cultural work were to support transition and short-term establishment in another culture specifically procedures designed to prepare and support individuals and families to live comfortably and work effectively in a culture other than their own, generally overseas and for a short temporary period of time. Well not stated social-political issues of oppression, discrimination, prejudice were seemingly avoided concepts and the definitions of cross-cultural communications and cross-cultural counseling and therapy. In essence those individuals who used to the term are early tended to in some sense operate as if that cross-cultural communications, cross-cultural counseling and understanding were simply an intellectual concept, the cognitive understanding of cultural differences and values and behaviors and there was a generally an avoidance in discussion of the social, political nature of cross cultural work. Now, one of the things that I differ perhaps maybe not that much and perhaps I’m misreading what the panelist are saying here, I do true… truly believe that multicultural counseling and therapy in essence is an (inaudible ) of the multicultural, multiculturalism, a social movement. Multicultural counseling and psychotherapy unlike cross-cultural counseling and psychotherapy is indeed not value free or neutral. Multicultural counseling and psychotherapy takes into effect in consideration that in some sense social justice forms one of the basic elements in terms of dealing with the clients or client systems in oppressive feelings and atmospheres and that, that is one of the things I find missing in the historical evolution and bases of the field of cross-cultural counseling and communication. I’ve another ah… ah… concern and difference with indeed the panel here, it’s something that my good friend and colleague Fred mentioned and that is that if you do counseling within your own culture you are considered culturally competent. I challenge that. I… I frankly do not believe that many of my white brothers and sisters who work with white European-American clients are culturally competent. And that is an issue that I don’t want to belabor but it’s a very important issue for us to, you know to begin to look at in order to I expect that anyone can become culturally competent. Cultural competence is a journey and ideal in which people strive towards, to achieve in one way or another. Another area that moving apart from the ah… ah… the philosophical differences and I guess I would say, why don’t we just drop the term cross cultural counseling completely and go to multicultural counseling and psychotherapy or use cross cultural counseling to refer to international aspects. I know Fred and many of my colleagues really have a much more broad international prospective, but maybe that's… you know one consideration that now we can do. But another one that deals with something that I think, I have began to question seriously in terms of all the work that I have done that my colleagues have done in cross cultural ah… and multicultural counseling is the avoidance or the lack of talking about changing implicit bias in the development of cultural competence and my work on racial microaggressions indicate then it is possible for someone to consciously denounce bias, racism, sexism and heterosexism believe that they would never willingly harm or hurt other people, but still harbor unconscious racist attitudes, beliefs, that are outside the level of their conscious awareness. In one of the studies, a first studies to measure the development and change of implicit and explicit racial attitudes over time. The investigators Baron and Banerjee at Harvard, sampled three different age groups, six year-olds, 10-year-olds and adults. The 6-year-old age group was chosen because studies indicate that children between 3 and 6 years of age only begin to form attitudes about specific social groups and by age 5 usually have an adult-like concept of race. The investigators create ah… ah… created a children's version of what we call the IAT, the Implicit Attitudes Test and many of you I think in social psychology have seen this, you can go on the website and take the exam, the adult versions yourselves. They found the following and I want you to carefully listen to the results of the following because they now speak poorly about potentially what we see as cultural competence and even the education and training. They found first that age six implicit and explicit race bias attitudes were relatively similar. You know the unconscious and conscious were very similar. At age 10, a dissociation began to occur between implicit and explicit race bias. Explicit bias tended to decrease, but implicit bias remain unchanged and in adulthood explicit bias dropped even further, all the support from a (inaudible ) videos work, but implicit bias remain unchanged. Now these findings are extremely meaningful because they suggest that implicit bias among all three groups remain constant, but that explicit bias decrease significantly. Now what relationship does this have for our discussion about cultural competence, multicultural training and so forth? It is this that in another recent study in 2009 by Boyson and Vogel, what they found was this, now again the instrument they used to measure multicultural or cross-cultural competence was to (inaudible ) instrument and it can be, we can challenge whether that is an accurate measurement or not. But they study the effects of multicultural training on implicit bias associated with African-American, lesbians and gay man. While multicultural competence increased with more training, again implicit bias in these groups remained untouched. So what we are, if you think about this logically, not only as you adequately point out, that all these instruments that are report(ph) to measure multicultural competence or cultural competence are not measuring the implicit bias, they are measuring the cognitive awareness and again I agree wholeheartedly with the panel that self-report only deals primarily with conscious awareness of what is going on here and this has major implications and there are several questions I would like to end this session with, to ask the panel. Even in light of your conceptual critique would simply dropping the term cross-cultural counseling or cross-cultural competence in favor of using the term multicultural counseling or cultural competence to meet your definition solve the problem. Rather than moving back to terms and concepts full of ethnocentric baggage, might not moving forward with those more contemporary terms be more fruitful. Now this will cause… create a lot of… of difficulties in terms of language and whether we can have a superordinate term that would encompass when I considered there are differences between counseling internationally and multicultural counseling that deals with domestic issues. Two, your analysis implies that people counseling individuals from their own culture maybe considered culturally competent. But do you… truly believe that everyone is culturally competent to work with members of their own group. I'm not sure that white folks for example are necessarily culturally competent to work with their own kind and I also have certain disagreements, well if not disagreements… but elaborations with the ah… ah… the statement that what is good counseling. Again there is I use to talk about working differently with racial ethnic groups and my colleagues would often times say to me ”Good counseling is good counseling” and what they defined as good counseling was very Western-European in orientation and tended to say that we don't have to look at these differences. Three, I agree that there are definitional problems in speaking about these concepts. But do you really contend that there are no significant similarities or considerable overwrap in terms of talking and trying to define ah… ah… this term of cultural competence or multicultural counseling and therapy. Four, critique of the definitions by various scholars is very illegitimate, but what would be the panels definition of multicultural or cultural competence. Can you attempt to define it for us? What would such a definition need to encompass what ah… that the… problematic limitations that we have? And fifth, studies on implicit and explicit bias add another greater complexity for both measurement and research of cultural competence. Given the fact that most measures of cultural competence and research deals with explicit bias, attitudes knowledge and beliefs. What would you suggest be needed in the development of instruments or in research that somehow deal with implicit bias. Thank you all for providing such a stimulating forum for all of us to discuss and I truly look forward to the publication of this manuscript. Thank you. 

00:56:00
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG Thank you. We now have an opportunity to get questions and discussions, either reactions to the panel presentation of the paper or to Professor Sue's comments about our paper. There is… this session has been videotaped and there is a microphone in the middle of the room, I would appreciate if you have questions, please come forward so that we can record the questions.

RIANA ANDERSON (ph) Hi! My name is Riana Anderson(ph) from the University of Michigan. Oh! Thank you so much for your presentation. It was very insightful, I really appreciate it attacking some of these things that I struggle with a lot in my own classroom. But I think one of the things that I was really interested in that I did hear about and I would love to hear if you have any idea of it as to really look at the concept of education and how we can measure what we are teaching people? And Dr. Sue has said specifically about the biases that these folks are having. If we teach them in this social justice method if… if we are talking about racism and prejudice as you all spoke yesterday, if we're looking at this lens through the social justice aspect and we're teaching it in that way. Do we think that these biases will change? Will our measurements actually be measuring what we are putting out in the field rather than what these people have had throughout their lives? How can we impact this APA mandate that we have cultural competency, if we're not having a standard competence throughout all of our instructions? I'm… I’m just really looking at a way that we can develop that field from the frontend so that our measurement will be more equal and more what we want at the end. 

00:57:55
[sil.] 

00:58:00
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG Well just I'll start off, ah… I think one of our critiques that we went through relatively quickly is to… to what extent is cross-cultural counseling competency different from general cross-cultural competencies. In other words, if you work with people from different cultures how are those intercultural skills different from working with the client or patient differently? In other words are they generic intercultural competencies from dealing with many cultures whether domestic or international that increases your multicultural or cross-cultural skills, but then you then take that into the therapy room and they are the same set of competencies you just use it in therapy or are they distinct different types of cross-cultural competency in the therapy room different from a manager or somebody you're dealing with a neighbor from a different cultures and stuff like that. We need to define those and are they distinctly different. So we… we did that is part of what we are struggling with. (inaudible . 

00:59:05
ABIGAIL Q. BILLINGTON I do. So actually really like your question ah… I… I think I want to point out before I respond that so Kate and I are actually organizational psychology students, so we actually don't come from a tradition or a background in counseling and so we kind of, I kind of have a different prospective for that reason and we were brought into the project because of our methodological knowledge and so I'm actually… I actually started training. So that's my interest and so we've talked about it a lot throughout this project and we actually I think we've decided to focus on kind of the outcomes and measurement before we go to training because at least in our field when we are studying training, we always have to start with what we know about the position and develop everything about that first and then we work… we work backwards from the criterion and what performance should be and then develop training based on that and so it’s almost like a checking in a question in terms of how you would go about that break. But I think I would start with the endpoint first. 

01:00:05
DERALD WING SUE Can I? 

01:00:05
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG Yeah, yeah. 

01:00:10
DERALD WING SUE I… I guess yesterday I had the plannery session, I'm not sure whether was you who asked the question or someone who asked the question about education and if we focus primarily in terms of bias, lets us say racial bias, I think that the field of socio-psychology does have findings about conditions that need to operate, let's say in Pre-K through 12, in order for children who go through an educational system to begin to be as free from bias as possible. We know the conditions, but how we implement it is quite different. I mean some of the conditions in social psychology come from studies on intergroup conflict and one of the ah… ah… method that conditions that need to exist is that contact has to occur between people if we talk about differences from that contact has to occur between individuals of different racial cultural ethnic groups. Now that's only one condition, it’s not a sufficient condition. Another condition that social psychology has outlined is that there has to be an accurate exchange of information about the particular groups that occurs through experiences, experiential reality and much of what passes about racial ethnic knowledge is misinformation or lack of information in curriculum in the school system. A third condition that needs to exist that people talk about the easiest way to really eradicate or minimize the impact of bias is that there has to be an equal status relationship between individuals. You have a CEO, white CEO interacting with a let's say ah… African-American janitor ah… that is not an equal status relationship in order to build and so there has to be an equal status relationship for change in attitudes and behavior to begin to occur. There are other conditions that social psychology have… act like mutual, a forth one being mutually shared goals. You know, right now in education and in our society we have competing goals often times. So if you… but… but all of the conditions have to exist together and therefore the question before I think education before employers, before… before all of us, is knowing that these conditions are good in development of anti-racism tactics, how do we create them and it is… it is very hard. How do we create equal status relationships when relationships in the United States are inherently unequal, in terms of the distribution of power and that's where I think we need to begin to look at, but much of the information exist already is that we are feeling powerless to implement it. 

01:03:35
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG Are there questions? 

01:03:40
[sil.] 

01:03:45
ALICE SHANG (ph) Hi! My name is Alice Shang(ph). I'm a clinical psych student from the University of Rhode Island. Ah… I have a question about multicultural competency. Ah… basically that Dr. Sue had eluded to that, that we can, it's… it's a journey that we can never be competent. I've come across situations where I feel like that which I agree to that, that you can never be competent. There is always more to learn. However, upon the situation where people would say when I talk about competency in terms of supervisor multicultural competency and things like that and I have been out that competency issue sometimes I'm getting the feedback that you know nobody can ever be competent, which sort of just end the conversation. And so what I found is that people care about multicultural competent issues, we understand there is that meaning to be competent and really competent-competent is a level but then there is also level of being proficient, you know proficient in something and knowing what you don't know until look for information’s that you don't know and so I don't know how to really deal with situation where the feedback is just out you know nobody can ever be competent so I'm just going to get few more looks and sort of end that conversation about competency. Thank you. 

01:05:15
DERALD WING SUE You know, that’s really a good point. Let me… Let me say several things. Ah… it sounds like when a colleague of yours has had no one can ever be culturally competent in that sense that would saying there is hopeless. I won't do anything. What should I… you know why should I do it. I think when I use, I do it that no one can ever be completely culturally competent. It is a goal, an ideal, but it is a goal worthy of striving for and that no one comes to an endpoint that it is a constant learning situation that needs to occur and part of cultural competence is the ability to recognize what your limitations are. But it is not an excuse to not continue the journey of striving to understand different racial ethnic groups and that's what if I sense it that's what they are saying, I will deal with that on that level, does that mean you're not going to try to understand further or you using that in some sense as an excuse not to do anything else. I've experienced in my early career where, when I… I went to the University of California, Berkeley my first position there was as a counseling psychologist and I was very much involved in the Asian-American Mental Health Movement. I had a white colleague, elderly while colleague, who I knew could care less about working with Asian-Americans, in fact I one time overheard him talking to a prospective individual applying for… ah… you know for services, ”Oh! We have an excellent Asian-American psychologist on the staff that can work with you.” I interpreted that as his laziness or his own hang up in problems about exploring further and making himself competent to work with Asian-Americans and then I had a second thought and that is that it maybe is best of he doesn't, indeed of that's his attitude. But there are two things about cultural competence recognizing what your limitations are, so that you can seek consultation or even refer out. If you choose to refer out, it is ultimately important that you own your limitations that it is not something wrong with the client that requires you to refer that client out. And the second aspect of cultural competence that Allen Ivey and I talk about often times is that you can never be (inaudible ) things to everyone. You know we talk about the repertoire of skills that a counselor needs to, they have to expand the repertoire. But many of us have limitations. We can't be of things to everyone. I can't work with a traditional Asian client is a subtle way without being quite direct about what I'm talking about. I cannot be like my father who can talk about in an embarrassing situation like he wasn't talking about that at all. Subtlety and indirectness is something that I don't have as a communication or a helping style. But what is important if you have that limitation is to realize your potential social impact upon the client. If you can recognize that you are going to come across is very western and direct, what things might you do, that would minimize the harmful impact or the traumatic impact that your inability to work with the client ah… you know that’s effective. These are all really complicated issues that more and more I began to look at rather than simply can we measure it. That there are things that my father used to teach me that I… would have a hard time of operationalizing it and dealing with it. One of them that he taught me very strongly was not all problems have a solution, you know it goes against our western culture that is defying the problem and solve it and I would… I would disagree with my father and he says, I would say then how do you deal with it? And he would say "You grow around it.” You know some… you know, I mean those are you know and he… he actually counsels in terms of giving statements like that and you as a… as a individual translate it to have meaning to what he in that sense talking about. 

01:10:15
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG Ah… I guess I agree with Derald on some level and then I just reviewed a paper on quality control for International Testing And Assessment and I think it's relevant here. Ah… what I guess when we to look at cultural or cross-cultural competence, is as a quality control issue. So quality and cultural competence as a quality is not the economist variable. It is not a Yes/No. Do you have cultural competence or you don't? Quality is a continuous variable because it is continuous variable in organizational psychology, we have this concept of continuous quality improvement, CQI. So it’s not something that you just say okay, it’s not a checklist, you're culturally competent. You're not culturally competent. It's something in terms of quality control that you build on. Where I disagree with Derald I think is that as somebody who is trying to apply for grants and so forth what and I make (inaudible ) that, this there is this implicit assumption that if something exist, it exist in some amount and can therefore be measured. So if I go to NIH and say I want to look at cross-cultural competency and whether effects outcomes for ah… ah… culturally diverse clients or racial ethnic minorities. I need to be able to measure that cultural competence. Okay, if it exists, it exist in some amount I need to be able to measure it. Otherwise how do I know that it’s having an effect. But in the consulting room in therapy and so forth, it’s really much more interactional. I think that's where constructivism and other things come in, in terms of the dialectic, but from a scientific point of view we’re much more into… into breaking it down into the analytical level and at same time recognizing that is not the economist(ph) but is some kind of quality but we need to measure the quality of that substance, that element, that active ingredient and then how does it impact in outcome. 

01:12:05
DERALD WING SUE I… I need to say that, I need to take off and that is not because Fred disagreed with me. I want you to know that. Ah… but you know in some sense I… I've got to leave for the airport. You know and I apologize because the reason why I'm leaving early it wasn't the Spirit(ph) Airlines went on strike that I think some you know, they only, so they had to book me on Delta and it was an earlier flight rather than the one that I have, but I really want to say that I thank the panel. I think for the… the… for the richness I think of the ideas that they have presented and we could go on endlessly in terms of… of discussing this and I… I… honestly do look forward to its publication because I think it's going to be ah… something very significant and you might even want to ask individuals to write responses to it, of which I would be glad to do. But thank you everyone. 

01:13:05
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG Thanks Derald! Safe travel! Okay um… we can take some more questions but now that Derald is leaving, I can react to his comments. Um… I… I think what Derald illustrated is one of the points we made which is we're still struggling with the definition of culture. Talking about what is the definition of cross-cultural competencies ah… 30 years later in terms of the 1982 paper and we're struggling with cultures is that his historical review I think is very important in that, the term cross-cultural comes from cross-cultural psychology, what Derald mentioned was that Paul Petersen, Richard Brislin Harry Triandis come from a social psychological background, they did cross-cultural psychology research and then applied it to the counseling and therapy for ah… arena and within that domain they borrowed the concept cross-cultural although Paul in his grant from (inaudible ) did say developing interculturally skilled counselors. So where they used the term cross-cultural and the cultural, I think Derald eluded to a very important struggle within the American Psychological Association right now which is that when we deal with multiculturalism and its impact on what we do as psychologist, we have this tension between domestic multiculturalism and international multiculturalism and so we were struggling with this that the cross-cultural counseling competency has a lot of baggage because it comes from the cross-cultural arena, of which I'm a member. I'm a cross cultural psychologist as well as a person who does racial ethnic minority research. So in response to one of his questions if we were to be very specific and follow his recommendations of using terms much more specifically, then we should use the term cross-cultural counseling for counseling people across cultures defined as nations, national boundaries. So if you counsel somebody from Afghanistan who has just arrived who is not a… a… US citizen, permanent resident that would be cross-cultural counseling. Within United States you would do cross racial if a white therapist is seeing an African-American, that would be cross-racial counseling or cross-racial psychotherapy. If he is counseling an Asian-American, it would be cross-ethnic, we would get into those terminologies so that we're specific about what cultures we are counseling across. So um… did you all have any comments before we open up for more questions? Okay let me see if there are more questions from the audience. 

01:15:30

01:15:35
ISAAC Issac, I came from University of Michigan. I know that that some states actually have a certification requirement for working with ethnic minority or racial ethnic minority population and their working capacity as a counselor or a social worker or mental health professionals and one of the occurrence I know of Washington State is that you have to work a year before you can be certified as certain ethnic minority specialist and I was fortunate to have that while I was working there, but the requirement itself is arbitrary(ph) as it is and I just want to… kind of you know hear your thoughts about whether requiring a certification maybe a way to sort of improve this sort of quality control issues that you've talked about earlier and if not what are the ways that it will be possible in order to make this sort of cultural competency issue more prominent in the cultural counseling and in the mental health professional arena. Thank you. 

01:16:50
FREDERICK LEONG Okay. Yeah um… from researchers point of view, I think those types of certifications and licensure is based on these defying cross-cultural competencies are premature. That part of our paper is that there is lack of definition. There is lack of appropriate research, the measures of all self-report and so forth. So in one sense I guess my reply is that is a clash of cultures, so that we are in academia, we have a different culture in terms of our rigor, the way we want to find outcome and the measures and so forth. But I also recognize that out there in the field and it comes from a different set of needs and motives in terms of like, you don't want people back to the earlier point about ethical practice, you don’t want people who are not culturally competent doing damage in therapy, so you need to have some kind of quality control and that's what certification and licensure is. But are we prematurely evaluating people cross-cultural counseling competencies, if we have all those problems that we’ve presented in this paper. So I think there are struggles between the two cultures. It’s a clash of culture between the scientific community and the practice community that require some kind of regulation, quality control, ethical practices and so forth and the researchers wanting to do better research that to know what we are actually measuring and stuff like that. My own personal view is that I think it is premature. Let me take this opportunity to comment on another one on Derald's point and see if you all want to make comments as well which I think is very important. What Derald said a kind of ah… resounded for me is that an assumption in our paper and this gets back to Abby’s point about the training prospective. The assumption that um… um… Richard Brislin and other people have approached is, comes from the cross-cultural psychology prospective and a very training oriented prospective that is very behaviorally oriented. In other words they were training people who are going to go on the peace Core(ph). There were training people who were gonna be diplomats and so forth. So it was a very behavioral orientation, meaning that these are skills and competencies that somebody who is gonna abroad will need. Somebody who is going to be a manager, assigned to Shanghai. Somebody who is going to do a year as a peace core(ph) in Nigeria. So it was very behavioral and that it was very skills oriented. What are the behavioral competencies? How to bow(ph) versus shake hand. You know what does the meaning on non-verbal and stuff ;ike that? So they are just behavioral skills that you need to acquire and you train these people, the acquire the behavioral repertoire, then become… they had become culturally competent and they go to all these countries. What Derald said which I think is very important is that that behavioral social skills approach and so forth ignores bias, prejudice, racism and so forth which is true in this country. Our training models in terms of those behavioral competencies, don't say anything about those biases, those prejudices and those our problems. We are assuming a tabula rasa, we need certain behavioral competencies, we identify them, we train you in them and then you're culturally competent and when we send you abroad. We don't say anything about what if you have certain under the AKS model and the awareness, and the attitudes and other beliefs. What you have… what happens if you have racist beliefs? What happens when you have these implicit biases that Derald talks about that actually get in the way of your ability to acquire these behavioral competences. So I think that's missing in our model. 

01:20:25
ABIGAIL Q. BILLINGTON Um… I mean to respond to that of course that opens up a whole new issue in that we actually don't really know how to train to change attitudes effectively and so that's why we haven’t included it because evidence really isn't there for how to do that of course we need to figure out how to do that but we don't know how. And then it is also an empirical question, I guess the studies on micro aggression which I'm only a little bit familiar with would suggest that in fact having these implicit biases does lead people to behave in ways that they wouldn't expect, yet at the same time ah… this might sound bad. But um… is it possible to fake it? Is it possible to make somebody feel comfortable um… using behaviors even if implicit attitudes don't match them outward behavior and we don't know that? 

01:21:15
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG Okay other questions from the audience? 

01:21:20
[sil.] 

01:21:25
LISA GOLDFORTH My name is Lisa Goldforth(ph), I am from Michigan State and I want to justify this comment on definition about the cultural competence and how you are to find in cultural competence compared to what Dr. Sue’s has defining it and I kept thinking about um… how you are defining it as someone who is culturally competent and they are all cultured and then I kept thinking about similar to inculturation(ph) in which you know we're grow up… we grew up into particular culture socioeconomic background, race, ethnic background, but then related to that what if part of that cultural competence include the implicit bias in which (inaudible ) is part of the culture and the racial, um… racism or sexism is part of that culture and that supported within that culture. So I still considered culturally competent if within that culture if it’s purporting and supporting under this negative prejudice or racism. 

01:22:20
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG Um… that's a good question um… right off the cuff, I think my concept of cultural competence of course back to the it’s not a dichotomist variable. It's a continuous variable is that of course white European-Americans who are trained as therapist, will have a range of cultural competence. Some people are much more competed in their own culture than others. My point is the cross-cultural part of it. In other words when we do cross-cultural counseling and psychotherapy courses, we don't focus on you know white therapist, let me train you more about what that your centric biases, what American values and so forth. What we're trying to do is to train them so that they can work across cultures. So that when they see an African-American client, when they see a Vietnamese client what do they need to… that's the basis of the AKS model. What are your attitudes that is serving as barriers to working with the Vietnamese fisherman or working with um… lesbian African-American woman and so forth. So that it is across the cultures that we need to focus on. What I didn't address specifically is that the level of cross-cultural competence and inherent in your question is what if that cultural competence from the Eurocentric prospective includes racism and bias and so forth and gets back to Abby’s point is that, are we… are we tried to change each of those cultures and back to yesterday's plenary, in terms of racism bias, whereas we're taking a much more behavioral approach of what are the competencies so that they provide competent care when they deal with a client who is different and so forth. So to answer your question, I don't think we address it because that's not the particular research question. Our research question is how do we train people to work with clients who are from a different culture when we do cross-cultural counseling and so forth. That relates to another point I want to make comment which I think was the question about do you ever achieve a cultural competence which is important. Some years back under the cross-cultural competency movement there was a paper published by Don Locke and Marie Faubert(ph) in the counselor educator and supervisor journal. And it was a point-counter point argument in the cross-cultural counseling competency area and we eluded to this in our paper is that um… do you train generic multicultural competencies or due to train… train culture specific competencies? So that you need to learn how to do therapy with a Vietnamese versus somebody who is from Afghanistan versus somebody who is you known an African-American that you know I lived here for a longtime is you know multigenerational and so forth. The unique culture specific competencies for each of the group that you deal with and if that is true and that's the point-counter point was that Don Locke was arguing for the ah… ah… ah… universalist prospective, that there should be some kind of meta cross-cultural counseling skills that once you trained in it, you can generalize across different groups in fact we were planning a study to look at those two. Or do you need to be trained on Vietnamese culture, Nigerian culture, Afghanistan culture? If that is true then we'll be in training for ever, before somebody is allowed to be licensed to practice because… what all the different cultures, what if it’s a new culture or do you actually then just get a cultural consultant when you have a client from a different culture that you are not trained in. And in fact that is an important dimension because back to the comparative effectiveness um… my colleague Nolan Zane who directs the Asian-American Disparities Research Center. The movement now is doing cultural at a patient taking this cross-cultural counseling competency movement and then adapting for cultural elements taking manualized therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, my colleagues Gordy Hall is back there actually supervising one of these… these studies doing cognitive behavior therapy with the present Chinese patients, out of Nolan's center. When you do these culturally adaptation therapies for Chinese-Americans, for Puerto Ricans and so forth, what Nolan is getting as a pushback which has the political dimension to it, but also I think an interesting, important research question is then and IHMS(ph) is asking how many cultural adaptation therapies are we going to fund? Or you gonna to comeback with a Mexican-American one, with a Cuban one, with a Korean one? So how is the field gonna advance if you need a cultural adaptation, a manualized therapy for each of the groups so is Gordy gonna comeback for a Japanese-American one, for a Vietnamese one and do we just keep funding multiple studies or is there a higher level set of cross-cultural competency? I think that is something we are struggling in the field. 

01:27:05
ABIGAIL Q. BILLINGTON I mean to add complexity that I have been so if you have a culturally adapted treatment then how do you decide who, what culture if somebody belongs to, so you know the Chinese-American college student who comes to you how do you know if they should have the Chinese-American or the Chinese adapted you know therapy or the I mean how do you know? And so that decides the level of complexity which is why you know a lot of people seem to want to study this higher level. 

01:27:30
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG Right and my point about the cross-cultural is important because Abby is talking about the use the Chinese to use in terms of the client. What about the therapist?. The therapist is an active participant in this. What if the therapist is Chinese? What if the therapist is African-Americans? In other words we are so just like the Cross-Cultural Competency Movement has been so over focused on the therapist, right. When we do cultural adaptation, we now switch it to the client. We are taking about a Cuban client, a Mexican client. Well a Cuban client, or Mexican client it depends on the therapist. Is the therapist Mexican? Is the therapist African-American? Is the therapist Vietnamese? Those are all different cultures, you can’t just assume. In other words the therapist had presumed to be ah… uniform and has equal value, that’s not true that’s was cross-cultural competency is very important. An African-American therapist working with a Vietnamese client is very different from a white European-American therapist working with a Vietnamese client because of racism, because of bias, the stuff they are all talks about. There are two people in that room in terms of cross-cultural psychotherapy, so our critique is the cross-cultural counseling psychotherapy literature has been focused so much on the therapist because it is really the trainers, these academicians who are in the training program, that’s who there are dealing with, they are training the doctor students who are the therapist. So their researches focused on the therapist. From these treatment research with cultural adaptation, they are interested in the client because IHMS(ph) is funding this, how to improve treatment. They are focusing on the patient or the client group and so forth, but there are two people in that room, it’s a… it’s a dyadic reaction in terms of the therapist and the client and both of their cultures are important. Please. 

01:29:20
ANNA BOVEN (ph) Hi! I am Anna Boven(ph) from Washington University, St. Louise. So I am glad that you’re talking about cultural adaptation and when we take a look at cultural adaptation models the therapist competence is not there. Right, we talk about as you are saying the manual and how to adapt the manual for the client. So will you suggest that we should include in the cultural adaptation models, AP's for the cultural competency of the therapist and where would that be? Would it be before the adaptation of the manual? Would it be across adaptation and so I just want to hear what your thoughts about it. 

01:30:00
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG Thanks Anna. That’s an important question, but I think like um… Abby was saying with (inaudible ) process. I think that’s a ways down the road, we are still at the cultural adaptation phase. In fact Gordy and I were at a conference on Asian-American Mental Health’s ah… a month or so ago in which I presented under the comparative effect of this research our proposal and my center to study this problem and I actually I have been developing from the cross-cultural competency movement my model which is cultural accommodation, training the therapist to accommodate for cultural differences in which the focus of the competency is on the therapist, and supposed to what are their cultural elements that are important for the client. So actually my proposal within the comparative effectiveness research (inaudible ) is actually to pit one against the other to do a cultural accommodation model in which you train the therapist in cross-cultural competency to see it generalizes and then compare the outcome of those patient as suppose to somebody who has seen a culturally adapted therapy that has been manualized and see from a comparative effectiveness point of view and I had been pointing to this, is that NIMHS(ph) is interested in cost and effectiveness. They don’t want to fund 67 cultural adaptations for all the different groups, so from a cost… cost point of view is cultural accommodation where you train the therapist to accommodate for cultural differences and so forth, much more cost effective than culturally adapted each manualized therapy for each of the groups, so we would pick a particular group, use culturally adapted um… ah… therapy for that particular group lets us say Chinese-Americans and then do cultural accommodation training for the therapist and see the outcome for those two groups. So I think that’s where we are at in terms of finding out the differential outcome of those two models. Eventually, I think down the line a small of these research comes up. I think we will have that model that you are talking about in which there is a tension to the therapist, to the client and to the process as it affects the outcome. We have time for one question I believe. 

01:32:00
SU LI (ph) Hi! My name is Su Li. I’m a clinical psychologist in (inaudible ). Um… I just have a one question, when you say cross-cultural and competency and how did you differentiate between just general counseling competency and cross-cultural competency um… and also as a… as a… (inaudible ) in the field I see a lot of clients, whites in different culture and if you have… to me if you have a general counseling competency and if I see different clients from different culture, I actually see consultation and know about the culture and sometimes I feel comfortable and the clients feel comfortable, we do have good kind of relationship and then I think it is effective in a way but when you say cross-cultural counseling um… competency and cultural… I don’t know what is the differences you’re talking about. 

01:32:55
FREDERICK T. L. LEONG Do you want to react? Okay. I think that’s we’re struggling with in terms of how is cross-cultural counseling competency different from generic counseling competency. From the position papers point of view it’s clear in that traditional western oriented counseling and psychotherapy is you centric, but it doesn’t recognize that it is your centric. In other words from the cross cultural point of view it’s called an imposed attic. In other words there are attic differences and the amid differences. Attic is universal, amid is culture specific. What we have developed in our field is ammic(ph) psychology which is European-American psychology, but is applied as if it is attic(ph). It’s applied as it is universal. In other words the European um… what my professor Forest Hather(ph) called the culture defining group, right. Why do we celebrate Christmas and give people vacation and not quanza(ph)? Because there is a culture defining group. The culture-defining group are the European-Americans. They define what’s suppose to happen in counseling a psychotherapy and that is a universalist approach, but what it really is emmic(ph), it’s culture specific. The European-American impose on other people. In other words give you a one specific example, person comes in with a career and decision problem and counselor goes “Oh! Of course you’re 18 years old, you need to separate from your parents you should in fact in what yourparents want to do. Ignore the fact that they want you to become a physician, if you want to be a musician, you should be a musician.” Well that is from the Eurocentric point of view in terms of individualism, in terms of individuation and so forth. What if the person comes from a very collectivist culture in which the family opinion is very important, that one continues to be very connected from a Eurocentric point of view, its viewed as a mesh from the Asian point of view it feels that very collectivistic and connected. So if we impose our Eurocentric point of view in that cross-cultural counseling and impose that universal model then those are the problems that the physician paper argued against. Is the traditional western counseling is biased? It uses the Western values, uses the western goals of counseling it’s psychotherapy, they all talks about process and outcome. The goals of what are to be accomplished in counseling are the goals of the therapist which is Eurocentric. If your client is not European-American, then you’re imposing a set of values on to that other person that may not be culturally appropriate. I think we are out of our time, but thank you very much for joining us in this morning session, hope you enjoy the rest of the conference.
