BEGIN TRANSCRIPT: 

00:00:00
SIMON H. BUDMAN Angelica, can we spoke a little bit on the phone about what was going on for you, but I wonder if you could tell me a little bit more about what brings you in today? 

00:00:10
ANGELICA Um I've been feeling pretty depressed and not sleeping. 

00:00:15
SIMON H. BUDMAN Hmm... 

00:00:20
SIMON H. BUDMAN This is Angelica, a 31-year-old women who has complaint of depressions and sever sleep difficulties. In the past, the patient like this might have been seen in an open-ended weekly basis without the need to consider length of treatment or use of resources. But with the coming of manage mental healthcare and year of limited resources, our views about psychotherapy must change. Angelica is not a real patient, but this portrayal of her initial session serves as a model for exploring and understanding the principles of time effective therapy. 

00:00:55
TREATING TIME EFFECTIVELY THE FIRST SESSION IN BRIEF THERAPY WITH SIMON H. BUDMAN, Ph.D. 

00:01:10
SIMON H. BUDMAN The cost of healthcare in the United States has reached a critical stage accounting for nearly 14% of the gross national product with expectations of increasing. One approach for providing cost effective health services is managed care such as health maintenance and preferred provider organizations. 

00:01:30
HEALTH CARE REFORM JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS C-SPAN LIVE 

00:01:30
BILL CLINTON We have to preserve and strengthen what is right with the health care system. 

00:01:35
SIMON H. BUDMAN The current plan for reforming health care promotes managed competition, a further attempt to reduce health care costs. 

00:01:45
ANGELICA I feel somewhat like we're making progress. 

00:01:45
SIMON H. BUDMAN Mental healthcare faces the same challenge to provide services more cost effectively without sacrificing quality. Time effective therapy is a treatment model designed to meet that challenge and in the process offer benefits for the patient, the provider and society as a whole. The model of time effective treatment is described more fully in this book. Theory and practice of brief therapy, but this program will present the basic concepts of time effective therapy and will include the following. 

00:02:20
TIME EFFECTIVE THERAPY WHAT IS TIME EFFECTIVE THERAPY? FINDING THE FOCUS THE THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP 

00:02:20
SIMON H. BUDMAN First, a definition of time effective therapy, then we'll look at methods for choosing a focus for treatment. The dynamics of the relationship between patient and therapists will be discussed. And the idea of using novel approaches, the foster change will be explored. Finally, we'll present ways to conclude the first session in a manner that is both useful and meaningful to the patient. 

00:02:50
WHAT IS TIME EFFECTIVE THERAPY 

00:02:55
ANGELICA I came out of a relationship a few months ago. You know, it was after that then I started not sleeping very well and so, maybe being lonely or something like that. 

00:03:10
SIMON H. BUDMAN Does it seem to you as though the sleep problems have something to do with coming out of this relationship? 

00:03:15
ANGELICA Yeah, I think so. 

00:03:15
SIMON H. BUDMAN Hmm… 

00:03:20
SB It is important to note that time effective therapy does not represent a new theoretical model for treatment, rather it provides a methodology intended to augment and build upon the practitioners existing therapeutic orientation. 

00:03:35
SIMON H. BUDMAN I'm glad that all of you could be here today. What I would like us to do today is to, to think about the whole issue of psychotherapy, time and psychotherapy and the way the time is used effectively and efficiently in psychotherapy. And, and the way I would like to do that is by… 

00:03:50
SIMON H. BUDMAN This group of mental health professionals have come together to learn about time effective therapy. Each comes from a different orientation and brings a different perspective to the discussion. Like many of us, these therapists sense the need to modify traditional open-ended therapy approaches to more efficient and less costly techniques whilst driving to maintain positive outcomes. 

00:04:15
SIMON H. BUDMAN , Ph.D. A lot of models of psychotherapy that we have sort of taken as gospel and, and, and understood in a very particular kind of way are really needed, needed to be modified a great deal for work with very populations. 

00:04:30
TIME EFFECTIVE THERAPY IS AN INTEGRATIVE MODEL 

00:04:35
SIMON H. BUDMAN And I think that what's, what’s most important and what's most valuable in terms of the model that, that I think about is the fact that, that what we tried to do is we try to be integrative and, and, and try to take things from psychoanalytic orientation and behavioral orientations and solution orientations to pull together in a useful way. And we also try to include the research on psychotherapy, because there is a great deal of research that's been done on what works and what doesn't work and what's useful and what's not useful that we can pull together in, in ways that are beneficial to our patients. 

00:05:15
TIME EFFECTIVE THERAPY IS A FELXIBLE MODEL 

00:05:15
SIMON H. BUDMAN Part of what I want you to think about when we talk about the issue of time effective psychotherapy is flexibility and of not getting locked into certain ways of understanding things, certain ways of believing about your patients, about our patients, about what happens with people and about the ways in which people change. This is a picture of a clock on a Cathedral in Florence that was built in about 1440, but I just wanted to think about is what's wrong with this picture. What is it about this clock that you see that's different or unusual? This is a 24-hour clock that runs counterclockwise. So what's wrong with the clock? The clock is doing a lot of things in the opposite way that a clock that we have right now do. When you look at that and think about it, ah the way that we got to the clocks that we use right now is basically an accident. Um people in the, in the mid 1500s or so people were making clocks this way and they were making clocks the way that we use them currently and it just so happened that the clocks that we, that we use now and the clock faces that we use now became the predominant mode of, of clock faces. Some people began to make clock faces one way, some people again began to make clock faces in other way and, and finally enough people began to make the clock faces that we know currently that, that those were the clock faces that came to be used. 

00:06:55
SIMON H. BUDMAN The point is that the way we divide time is arbitrary. This clock will still tell you what time it is, if you are flexible enough to see it. In the same way, we need to be flexible in our thinking about the use of time in psychotherapy. Effective therapy can be provided using time differently and we have become accustomed to, if we remain open-minded enough to see that. 

00:07:20
SIMON H. BUDMAN What happens with people, I think is that people get locked into certain sets of ideas. We come to believe that certain things are true and always true rather than, than, than that these things are, are constructs or developments or things which we as people sort of put together and, and, and get locked into rather than seeing things events as occurring flexibly. So that, that, that a key element, I think of time effective psychotherapy has to do with flexibility and has to do with openness ah to, to various possibilities rather than a lock in around the way that things happens. 

00:08:00
TIME EFFECTIVE THERAPY IS NOT BASED ON A SET NUMBER OF SESSIONS 

00:08:00
SIMON H. BUDMAN It's very difficult to clearly define brief psychotherapy by a specific number of sessions, but people have said as brief psychotherapy is psychotherapy that's under 10 sessions, that's under 15 sessions, that's under 20 sessions. Um and I think that one cannot define the treatment in that way and I'll tell you why, I think it's problematic to define it in that way. Um for one thing we know that the average number of sessions in this country that people come to psychotherapy is generally between about four and seven sessions per treatment episode. So that, that um if we're thinking about brief psychotherapy as contrasted with something else, if that something else is long-term psychotherapy already most of the people seen in this country in treatment are being seen in brief psychotherapy, but there is, there is, there is no more complexity to it as well. If, if you arbitrarily decide that brief psychotherapy is anything under 10 visits, what happens if you take those 10 visits and split them in half and make them into 20 half session visit, to 20 half hour visits? What happens if you then take those half hour visits or take those 10 visits and spread them out over two years, is that brief psychotherapy? Is that still fall under the definition of psychotherapy? I think that it's very, very problematic to say that brief psychotherapy is under a specific number of visits because there is so many ways to divide time and cut time and, and, and use time and treatment that, that just saying that it's under x visits is really quite problematic. Another problem that comes up in terms of the, the visit definition of short-term psychotherapy is that we also know from many large-scale surveys that have been done that on average, 55% to 75% of the people who quote terminate treatment at any given point in time, end up being seen again within the following year. So that, that rather than treatment being what we see in the sort of idealized model that we often have in our minds, it's a person comes in, sees you for a given number of sessions be that five sessions or a 100 sessions then terminates treatment, brings into that termination session, a parted plan(ph), gives it to you, shakes your hand and never sees you again that's not the way that it goes in psychotherapy. What's much more likely is that you see the person for a period of time and then there is an interval and they see you or they see somebody else again in treatment, and then there is another interval. 

00:11:15
TIME EFFECTIVE THERAPY IS BASED ON A FAMILY PRACTICE MODEL 

00:11:15
SIMON H. BUDMAN What really goes on in psychotherapy really looks much more like a primary care medicine model than it does the idealized model of treatment that we've had in our minds. So that the whole issue of definition is a complicated one, but what's, what's for certain is that one cannot define brief treatment by a specific number of visits and that's why the model that, that I have in my mind and teach people about is a model of time effective psychotherapy rather than brief therapy per say. What I'm trying to think about with the patient is ways to use time most effectively and most efficiently. 

00:12:00
TIME EFFECTIVE THERAPY EFFECTIVE IS THE KEY IS INTEGRATIVE FLEXIBLE MODEL FAMILY PRACTICE MODEL NO SET NUMBER OF SESSIONS 

00:12:05
NARRATOR In summary then, the essential features of time effective therapy are that time effective rather than just brief is the key especially in managed care settings. Time effective therapy takes an integrative approach to treatment. It is a flexible model that accounts for the ways that people change. It is based upon a family practice model of treatment and it is not based upon a set number of sessions. 

00:12:35
FINDING THE FOCUS 

00:12:40
ANGELICA Yeah, I have a hard time falling asleep because I work a lot and I have a lot on my mind when I get home from work. 

00:12:45
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:12:45
ANGELICA Sometimes I have family matters to deal with. 

00:12:50
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. And prior to two months ago or so, you were sleeping okay or how are you sleeping? 

00:12:55
ANGELICA I was sleeping maybe five or six hours a night. Maybe six hours a night. 

00:13:00
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. And then two months ago you began have to more difficulty sleeping or what started to happen? 

00:13:10
ANGELICA Well, I have nightmares a lot. 

00:13:10
SIMON H. BUDMAN In time effective therapy there are several techniques that are typically used in the first session. One of the first is to decide along with the patient what the focus of the treatment should be. 

00:13:25
SIMON H. BUDMAN One of the key factors in time effective psychotherapy is the issue of focus. Um every model of brief and time effective psychotherapy has as part of that model focus and, and, and thinking about what it is that you're going to be working with the patient on and what it is that you're not going to be working on. So if you're seeing this person, this person was coming into your office... 

00:13:50
Uh huh. 

00:13:50
SIMON H. BUDMAN what would you start thinking about in regard to the focus? The person that you're involved with in this relationship, their name is? 

00:14:00
ANGELICA Robert. 

00:14:00
SIMON H. BUDMAN Robert and, and what happened? How did the breakup occur? 

00:14:05
ANGELICA Um mostly, it was family and my involvement in my family. 

00:14:10
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:14:15
ANGELICA And my inability to escape them when they need me. 

00:14:15
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:14:20
ANGELICA Not that I want to escape them when they need me. 

00:14:20
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:14:25
ANGELICA Like my mother needs a lot of help right now. 

00:14:25
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. How does Robert feel about the, the way that your mother looks for help from you? 

00:14:35
ANGELICA Well, he felt like I was being used by my parents. 

00:14:35
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:14:35
ANGELICA Like they, they always felt comfortable enough to call on me at any time if the day or night to come and help them out of the situation. That wasn't always a situation. It was my mother made up things, she made up, she like to be dramatic. 

00:14:50
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. So what would she do? She'd give you a call? 

00:14:55
ANGELICA She would, one time she fell out of the car and claimed that she broke her wrist and she didn't, another time she slipped on the ice, and both time she was drunk. 

00:15:05
SIMON H. BUDMAN Hmm... 

00:15:05
ANGELICA Claimed that she broke her leg, just to get me to go down there. 

00:15:10
SIMON H. BUDMAN Hmm... And, and ah when you got down there, what would be happening? What would they be calling on you to do? 

00:15:15
ANGELICA Oh, she would be in sleep in bed. 

00:15:20
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. And, and what would you have to do under those circumstances? 

00:15:20
ANGELICA I'll talk to my father really in this sort of time keep him, he's a... he used to drink a lot. 

00:15:30
SIMON H. BUDMAN Hmm... 

00:15:30
ANGELICA And has recently gotten some help from you know from different groups that he goes to. 

00:15:35
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. Uh huh. 

00:15:35
ANGELICA And he gets support and, and he doesn't have enough in himself to support her as well. 

00:15:45
SIMON H. BUDMAN Right, so you go down there and try to be helpful ah to her mostly or to him? 

00:15:50
ANGELICA To him mostly. 

00:15:50
SIMON H. BUDMAN To him mostly. And Robert began to feel it that was an intrusion on, on your relationship with him? 

00:16:00
ANGELICA Hmm... Yes, yes. 

00:16:00
SIMON H. BUDMAN Um what was his feeling? What he want you to do? 

00:16:05
ANGELICA He wanted me to call him back and say, no, I can't come down, I'm busy or I have plans with Robert or maybe he wanted to me pay that much attention to him or I don't... he wanted me not, not to go to stand up for myself and say, I'm not getting into my car and driving for two hours because you are drunk. 

00:16:25
SIMON H. BUDMAN Right, right. So did you ever do that? Did you ever not go? 

00:16:30
ANGELICA No. 

00:16:30
SIMON H. BUDMAN You always went? 

00:16:30
ANGELICA I cannot go. 

00:16:35
SIMON H. BUDMAN What sort of thoughts are you having about focus initially from what you are hearing ah, ah from her? Anybody? 

00:16:45
She is caught in the drama between her parents. 

00:16:45
SIMON H. BUDMAN Hmm... 

00:16:45
Feels that she has to move in and take care of her father, and almost to save her father from her difficult mother. 

00:16:55
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. So she is in the middle of this triangle needing to take care of both, both sides, both parents. 

00:17:05
Uh huh. 

00:17:05
SIMON H. BUDMAN Okay. 

00:17:05
And I'm wondering about whether in terms of a focus it's whether she is ready to shift from having been in a position to be getting to move out of this. 

00:17:15
SIMON H. BUDMAN Hmm... 

00:17:15
In terms of her responsibility to the family as opposed to some responsibility to herself as in a, as in a... 

00:17:25
SIMON H. BUDMAN She's wondering about her readiness bear to, to start doing something else. 

00:17:30
Yeah, yeah. 

00:17:30
SIMON H. BUDMAN What else? Anything else? 

00:17:35
Obviously, this familial enmeshment kept her out of this relationship, but was this relationship one that she really wanted and is she using the family enmeshment... 

00:17:40
SIMON H. BUDMAN Hmm... 

00:17:45
...to enable her, to not have that relationship. 

00:17:45
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:17:45
And so, I think the focus needs to be on understanding her feelings about the relationship 

00:17:55
SIMON H. BUDMAN Hmm... 

00:17:55
Because that's what the only kind of why now that I here. 

00:18:00
SIMON H. BUDMAN Anybody else? 

00:18:00
Well, I guess I'd like to hear what she wants, I mean my sense. She is distressed about the sleep, but I'm still not certain what it is she is coming to you for, what does she want? 

00:18:10
SIMON H. BUDMAN Right, right. 

00:18:10
What is she looking for? Because they were certainly a number of issues that could be the focus of the treatment. 

00:18:15
SIMON H. BUDMAN Okay, okay. 

00:18:15
And I'm not really certain at this point what she is looking for. 

00:18:20
SIMON H. BUDMAN I think that that's a very good point, Mona. I think that, that there are a wide arrays of possibilities that we're going to see with everybody. Ah it's very rare that you see somebody who comes in and says you know I want to deal with this issue, only this issue nothing else and, and, and that's it. People generally come in with a, a fairly wide array of things that are going on in their lives. And when people come in to see us and they say, I want to deal with this issue and only this issue, then we become suspicious, and, and we say, what's really going on, what do they really want to deal with that's, that's beyond this issue? From your perspective, Angelica do you see the relationship with your parents as a problem or as an issue for you, are you concerned about it? 

00:19:15
ANGELICA Not really, I mean, I'm concerned about my mother and so far as I'm afraid that she'll get killed or she'll crash her car. 

00:19:25
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:19:25
ANGELICA I worry about that every day. 

00:19:30
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. Uh huh. 

00:19:30
ANGELICA And I worry about my father that that he'll get so frustrated that he'll start drinking again. 

00:19:35
SIMON H. BUDMAN So the issues for you that you're here about today really don't have that much to do with your family. It's really much more to do with your sleep problem and with your relationship with Robert. Is that right? 

00:19:50
ANGELICA Yes. 

00:19:50
SIMON H. BUDMAN In this interview with Angelica, there are three possibilities for what the focus of treatment might be. 

00:19:55
FOCUS SLEEP PROBLEMS LOSS OF RELATIONSHIP DEMANDS OF PARENTS 

00:19:55
SIMON H. BUDMAN The sleep problem that she initially complained about, the loss of her relationship with Robert or the demands the placed upon her by her parents. Keep in mind that these three are only a few of the possible foci with this patient. 

00:20:10
SIMON H. BUDMAN The way that I think about psychotherapy is like a large decision tree and you come down this path and then the, the decision splits and you choose to either ask this question or this question you asked about history or you can ask about present issues and pursue that path, and then that path splits again. There are number of places along road where one needs to be making choices. 

00:20:40
TIME EFFECTIVE THERAPY CHOOSING THE FOCUS DECIDE WITH THE PATIENT 

00:20:45
NARRATOR Every patient presents with several possible areas of focus. As you begin to think about how you'll focus your therapy, there are several important points you should keep in mind. First, decision should be made with the patient as a joint exercise, don’t try to touch on all problem areas at once, often selecting one or two will have a significant ripple effect, but do make a decision the layer of avoidance are counter-productive in time effective therapy. It is important in time effective psychotherapy to emphasize the positive and hopeful side of what people bring in. In other words, to address the strengths rather than solely their pathology. 

00:21:25
SIMON H. BUDMAN And, and once you go down there and/or with them and try to help them out, what do you then feel? Do you feel like you've done the right thing or you've been helpful? 

00:21:35
ANGELICA Yes, definitely. 

00:21:35
SIMON H. BUDMAN And what sort of help do you provide them when you're down there? What's the help do you give them? 

00:21:40
ANGELICA More or less, just comfort that I'm there and then I'm there if they need me. 

00:21:45
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:21:50
ANGELICA And I don't drink myself. 

00:21:50
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:21:50
ANGELICA I think that's they look to me as someone who is, who is fairly level-headed and that they can depend on me in it and I was feeling like it's better for me to go down there and fix it and I feel good when I leave. 

00:22:05
SIMON H. BUDMAN And have you… 

00:22:05
ANGELICA I'll fix a situation. 

00:22:05
SIMON H. BUDMAN Have you mostly been able to fix it? 

00:22:10
ANGELICA Yes. I think just showing up fixes it. 

00:22:10
SIMON H. BUDMAN Just showing up fixes it. So um are there other kids in the family, or there any siblings? 

00:22:15
ANGELICA Yeah. I have two sisters and half-brother and I half-sister. 

00:22:20
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. And do they go down and fix it also or is it just you who fixes it? 

00:22:25
ANGELICA No. They've never, they've never asked. 

00:22:25
SIMON H. BUDMAN They never asked? 

00:22:25
ANGELICA No. 

00:22:30
SIMON H. BUDMAN So, you're in a very key position in this family. You are the one who is, who is always fixing it. 

00:22:35
ANGELICA Yeah. 

00:22:35
SIMON H. BUDMAN What's the most helpful thing that could come out of our meeting today? 

00:22:40
ANGELICA Maybe some sort of sense of satisfaction that I, that I'm by talking it would get, about of getting some of it off my chest or because I've just been wondering around and thinking about it by myself for so long 

00:22:55
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:22:55
ANGELICA And not sleeping and being an awake at night thinking about it and dreaming about it and it's just, it's a relief to be able to talk to somebody about it. 

00:23:10
SIMON H. BUDMAN Right. When one starts from the, the, the pathological position and looks most strongly at the pathological position um that, that what that has inherent in it is a certain kind of pessimism about people, about the likelihood of change, about what people bring into the situation. And on the other side, looking at people strengths, looking at the health that they bring into the therapeutic situation brings with it a certain kind of optimism and hopefulness about people and about where people can go. If we turn to her strengths, what does she bring by way of strengths? Anybody? 

00:23:55
She is introspective. 

00:23:55
SIMON H. BUDMAN Hmm... 

00:24:00
She is I think bright. 

00:24:00
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:24:05
And she seems capable of reporting a bad affect. 

00:24:05
SIMON H. BUDMAN Right, right. So she can stand back from the situation, she can talk about the situation, ah she is smart enough to understand some of what's going on for her at least? Anybody else? 

00:24:20
ANNE That's one of the problems I have because my fear is that when you just looking for the positive, It can't, it feels like it could be an emphatic failure 

00:24:30
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:24:35
ANNE To not be a toon to be somebody's pain. 

00:24:35
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:24:35
ANNE And it's sometimes I can think of, of this it's time effective, but it focus on solutions and positive, it's sort of like pep talk therapy. 

00:24:45
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. Uh huh. 

00:24:45
ANNE And that that's really where I have a problem with it. 

00:24:50
SIMON H. BUDMAN I think you made a good point, Anne, but the thing which is important, is not that you're, you're, you're sort of losing what hurts people or that that people do feel hurt or do feel badly. But that what you're bringing to the relationship is the knowledge and the ability to see that people in a variety of circumstances and some of most what appears to be some of the most terrible circumstances can and will change and, and that people although, they may come in with the sort of feeling that I can never change. Nothing can ever be different. I think jumping in on the side of pathology helps to reinforce that and looking at the other side I think helps them see beyond where they are and, and, and more on the hopeful change oriented side. 

00:25:40
SIMON H. BUDMAN In my interview with here Angelica displaced several characteristics that in my opinion should be considered as strengths. 

00:25:50
STRENGTHS CARING PERSON NOT A SUBSTANCE ABUSER WANTS TO CHANGE 

00:25:50
SIMON H. BUDMAN These include, the fact that she is a caring and concerned person in regard to her parents, Robert and one would assume in other relationships as well. The fact she unlike most of her family does not abuse alcohol or drugs, and the fact that she has decided to take steps to improve and change her situation. 

00:26:10
A MODEL FOR CHANGE PRECONTEMPLATION 

00:26:15
SIMON H. BUDMAN How do people change? One mode for change that is useful for understanding that process was developed by two psychologist Prochaska and Diclemente. In the precontemplation stage, a person demonstrates little motivation for change. They might see a therapist because they're being pushed in by some outside circumstance, but their own interest in change is really quite minimal. For example, a person arrives at your office and says I'm here because I've been told that I have a, ah a drug problem. You say to that person, do you think you have a drug problem? The person says, not really. I'm, I'm, I'm really here because my wife said that she would divorce me unless I got this drug problem taking care of. That person has very little of their own motivation at hand for the change. They're coming in because they're being pushed in, they're being pushed in by the courts. They're being pushed in by somebody else or by somebody outside circumstance, but, but their own interest in change is really quite minimal. 

00:27:20
A MODEL FOR CHANGE CONTEMPLATION 

00:27:25
SIMON H. BUDMAN Contemplation is the point that which people are really beginning to consider the possibility of change. But they have some ambivalence or uncertainty about that change. A good example of this is ah the person who comes in who has problems with alcohol sits down in your office says that, their doctor suggested that they come in because their liver function tests have been lousy, the person says, yeah, you know I think I may have been having some problems with alcohol. This, this really is an issue for me. But then again, on the other side of things, I know some people who really are alcoholics. I don't consider myself an alcoholic, I can stop anytime that I want to etc., etc. Um so that the person is there because they understand that there is a problem and that they understand that there is an issue, but then on the other side there is really is some uncertainty and ambivalence about changing this behavior, about giving up the behavior, about making whatever change it is in question. 

00:28:25
A MODEL FOR CHANGE ACTION 

00:28:25
SIMON H. BUDMAN People in the action phase are ready to change. They may need additional support, but they have made the decision to make whatever change is in question. An example of this might be the person who is a smoker, has been a smoker for many, many years and has made the decision to stop smoking, has tried to stop smoking and he's really not been very successful in doing that and he's coming to you for some additional input. You know, I know that I want to stop smoking, I've a smoker for a long period of time, I know that it's destroying my lungs, but I just haven't been able to do it. I tried the patch or tried this, tried the other thing. But I need some additional help from you in terms of, of going about doing this. That person is in the action stage of change. 

00:29:15
A MODEL FOR CHANGE MAINTENANCE 

00:29:15
SIMON H. BUDMAN Finally, there is the maintenance stage that is holding on to whatever change has been made. This is a very useful model in a variety of ways in terms of the clinical work that we do and it's useful for a number of reasons. 

00:29:30
A MODEL FOR CHANGE PRECONTEMPLATION CONTEMPLATION ACTION MAINTENANCE 

00:29:35
SIMON H. BUDMAN One reason that it's useful is because the way that people are approached or need to be approached at these different stages of change very a great deal. If you approach somebody who comes in to see and is really in the contemplation stage in regard to their change and you approach them as if they were in the action stage, ah not much gets done. Your assumption is that they want some skills and input about how to make this change. When in fact, what they're looking for is an opportunity to deal with the ambivalence about the change. If you, if you see somebody who is in precontemplation and deal with them as if there are any contemplation or as if there an action again, it's a sure fire way for things not to happen. And, and, and it's very important that we think about where people are in the change process. 

00:30:35
THE THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP 

00:30:40
SIMON H. BUDMAN In terms of what we were talking about this morning, which way do you want to go? What are your feelings about what you want to do? 

00:30:50
ANGELICA I feel like the reason I'm here... 

00:30:50
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:30:50
ANGELICA ...is because I'm incapable of making that decision myself. 

00:30:55
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:30:55
ANGELICA And I need either help from you to understand it or advice from you... 

00:31:00
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:31:05
ANGELICA ...to help me understand it. 

00:31:05
SIMON H. BUDMAN We know from research that perhaps the greatest variance in regard to outcome in psychotherapy has to do with the development of an alliance between the patient and the therapist, a therapeutic relationship. Giving Angelica the opportunity to express her feelings and thoughts provides her with a role in her own therapy. 

00:31:25
THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP PROVIDES HER WITH A ROLE IN TREATMENT 

00:31:25
SIMON H. BUDMAN One where she can take primary responsibility for making whatever changes are appropriate. 

00:31:30
SIMON H. BUDMAN You're in a tremendous bind at this point. You find yourself in an enormous bind. Here on the one hand is Robert, somebody that you really care about, on the other hand is your family where you feel tremendous amount of loyalty and concern and worry about them. So where do you go with this? 

00:31:55
ANGELICA I don't know. I guess I do have to make a choice. 

00:32:00
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:32:00
ANGELICA And ah... I don't know, I don't know what choice to make. 

00:32:10
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:32:10
ANGELICA I think that you know I want to stay(ph), I would probably choose to, to be with Robert and to, to be more separated and, and to have my family be less dependent on me. 

00:32:20
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:32:25
ANGELICA I guess that's what it's going to take. 

00:32:25
SIMON H. BUDMAN So you're pretty sure that this has to do with the situation around Robert? 

00:32:30
ANGELICA It's in my head all the time. 

00:32:30
SIMON H. BUDMAN It's in your head all the time? 

00:32:30
ANGELICA Yeah. 

00:32:35
SIMON H. BUDMAN And, and you spend a lot of time thinking about it at night? 

00:32:40
ANGELICA I act out in my head what would happen if I made this decision 

00:32:40
SIMON H. BUDMAN Hmm... 

00:32:40
ANGELICA And, and at the same time, I go over in my head what would make, what would happen if I make the other decision and none of them make me feel like going to sleep. 

00:32:50
SIMON H. BUDMAN Right. I can see why. I can see why. 

00:32:55
SIMON H. BUDMAN What you thought first about the therapeutic relationship? What kind of relationship might this woman want with me or need with me in the therapy? Any ideas about that? 

00:33:05
My thought is that she is not looking for someone to take the side of mother and father or off the boy friend. 

00:33:10
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:33:15
I think she is very much saying please I need someone to discuss this with it. 

00:33:15
SIMON H. BUDMAN Right. 

00:33:15
And share it with. 

00:33:20
SIMON H. BUDMAN Right. 

00:33:20
So that she can make that decision. 

00:33:20
SIMON H. BUDMAN so that, she can make the decision. And if she had not pushed and controlled... 

00:33:25
Right. I think she really need someone to be there kind of in a, in a moderate position with her so she can make the choice. 

00:33:30
SIMON H. BUDMAN Right. Good point. 

00:33:30
She is also saying, it's in my head all the time and I need to talk about it so if she talks about it perhaps it won't have to be so much in her head and she is looking for you to either carry this dialogue with her or listen to her to give her place to deal with this. 

00:33:45
SIMON H. BUDMAN Right. 

00:33:50
NOVEL APPROACHES TO CHANGE 

00:33:55
SIMON H. BUDMAN In time effective therapy, novel approaches can provide patients with a new perspective on their problems. One of the most powerful of these is the use of metaphor. 

00:34:05
SIMON H. BUDMAN It's very interesting as you talk about um your family and Robert and the relationship with Robert, it sounds like in some ways you feel sort of handcuffed and, and, and in an incredible bind between both of those sets of relationships. Is that how you feel? What's your feeling about? 

00:34:30
ANGELICA Well, I, I kinda feel handcuffed, handcuffed to both of them. 

00:34:35
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:34:40
ANGELICA And they're both pulling me from the center out 

00:34:40
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:34:40
ANGELICA And I, I don't really know which, you know I don't which arm is stronger. 

00:34:45
SIMON H. BUDMAN Right, right. So it's a, it's a tremendously difficult decision to make. 

00:34:55
ANGELICA Yes. 

00:34:55
SIMON H. BUDMAN I think that part of what we do, has to do with helping people get on different perspective on what's going on for them. In terms of the issue of the metaphor that was used here about the handcuffs. What do you think about that? What was your thought? What's your reaction to it? Any other metaphors that you might think about for her situation ah that you might think about ah my using or you using this sort... yes. 

00:35:25
I have a couple of thoughts. One was the idea of the cuffs... 

00:35:25
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:35:30
...I thought of King Solomon. 

00:35:30
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:35:30
You know... 

00:35:30
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:35:30
...and somehow you know presenting her with, with the way that was resolved people(ph) could. 

00:35:35
SIMON H. BUDMAN Right. 

00:35:35
You know we're somehow using that that was one thought I had. 

00:35:40
SIMON H. BUDMAN Good point. Anybody else? 

00:35:40
I think her voice is, is the key unlocking the handcuffs 

00:35:45
SIMON H. BUDMAN Uh huh. 

00:35:45
That she has never had chance to be heard as herself. 

00:35:50
SIMON H. BUDMAN Right. 

00:35:50
Um so sort of muring and reflecting back and echoing what her voice is, so she can pay attention to her need and then I think she has the key to those handcuffs. 

00:36:00
SIMON H. BUDMAN Right. I think the sign of a good metaphor is that the patient picks up on it. 

00:36:05
Uh huh. 

00:36:05
SIMON H. BUDMAN If, if, if the patient respond to the metaphor with what appears to be little interest and little involvement that goes off to something else or presents you’re their own metaphor that's fine. Ah but if, if somebody hears the metaphor and then speaks in the metaphor I think that that's terrific and it's a sign I think that you're moving in the right direction with that particular metaphor. 

00:36:35
THE SESSION SUMMARY 

00:36:40
SIMON H. BUDMAN We have to stop in little bit but, but why don't we think together a little bit about what's going on today ah... and, and think about how we can ah... proceed from here. Is that okay with you? 

00:36:55
ANGELICA Sure. That's great. 

00:37:00
SIMON H. BUDMAN All right. It sounds to me as though… 

00:37:00
SIMON H. BUDMAN It is critically important that every session of time effective psychotherapy include a summary. A time when the therapist and patient can explore the patients readiness for change consider the focus, think about what's transpired in the session, plan for the future, discuss the time frame for sessions and develop homework assignments. 

00:37:25
SIMON H. BUDMAN Let's think a little bit about how we could proceed from here. Um maybe what we can do is to plan to meet two more times after this ah about two or three weeks apart to give you some time to work on things between sessions. What if you planned to do the following? First of all, ah between now and the next time that we meet that ah... that you do go down there and ah... maybe begin to talk to them a little bit about some of your thoughts and plans about ah... changing things, just ever so slightly ah between you and your family. How would you feel about doing that? 

00:38:15
ANGELICA Fine. 

00:38:15
SIMON H. BUDMAN Is that okay? 

00:38:15
ANGELICA Yeah. 

00:38:15
SIMON H. BUDMAN It is critically important that every session on how a summary included as a part of it. Why is it important? One reason that makes it important is that there is some reasonable likelihood with many people that this maybe the only session that you have with that person, so it's critically important that you take your best shot ah in the session. Even if you've seen the person more than once, ah it's, it's possible with that person won't come back, won't be able to come back, won't be interested in coming back again and I think that every session of treatment ah needs to connect up with other sessions, but it also needs to be self-contained. If that person never came back again, if that person never returned for treatment after that point, ah it's my goal that that the person takes out with them something or some things that are useful, helpful and beneficial and some things that they can work with and, and leave the session with that. Another reason that make the session summary important is that it is very rare at this point that I see people on a weekly basis. Ah... the, the people may be seen ah initially a few times close together, ah I may see them then in some sessions that are spaced from one another, I may see them close together again at some other point when something comes up. But in terms of the use of time and in terms of the time efficient use of treatment resources there is nothing that that is written in stone that says that that seven days apart is the best way to change. Ah it's really an historical accident. In many ways I think it's an historical accident like the clock that runs clockwise is an historical accident. It was a certain amount of convenience for therapists, therapists sort of felt I think that within their own schedules it makes a lot more sense to see people on a weekly basis. But there is nothing magical about weekly psychotherapy, maybe for some people daily psychotherapy for a short period of time is very important, maybe for some people yearly psychotherapy is important, maybe for some people six-month psychotherapy is important, but there is nothing inherently valuable about seeing people on a weekly basis. It comes from nowhere in the research that I know of that, that's indicated. So that frequently I'm seeing people on various kinds of spaced and intermittent intervals. And what's critically important is that people be able to make the best use of time between sessions. 

00:41:10
SIMON H. BUDMAN Like the use of metaphors out of session or homework assignments provide a novel approach which can help empower the patient in the change making process. The vast majority of the patient's time is spent out of therapy and it is essential to think about ways to have the therapeutic process leave the room with the patient. Homework assignments are one method for doing that. 

00:41:35
SIMON H. BUDMAN Before you taking the other steps, Angelica I wonder if for the next time that we meet, we might do a couple of things. One is that that you come in with Robert so that the three of us can meet together and talk to him about that. The other is I wonder if you could write, but not send to your mother a letter about your relationship with her and what you would like from that relationship and the ways that you would like to change the relationship, have that before you? How do you feel that with before you? 

00:42:20
ANGELICA To write it down. Well, I could probably tell you what I would write down. 

00:42:25
SIMON H. BUDMAN That's fine. But if, if you could just sort of sit and give us some thought maybe Angelica that's one way to use the time when you can't sleep at night. So that when you're awake at night just sort of tossing and turning in bed rather than just trying to lie there, maybe what you could do is to get up and do some work on this letter, focus on the letter, think a little bit about what it is that you want to say to your mother and, and use the time productively in that way for yourself. How would you feel about that? 

00:43:05
ANGELICA Fine. Fine, I guess. The first thought that came into my head when you said that was what you know because I think that the things that I would write to my mother are not entirely pleasant and, and what if something happened to me and she finally got the letter 

00:43:25
SIMON H. BUDMAN Hmm... 

00:43:25
ANGELICA You know if they had to come to apartment and what if she got the letter and, and knew the way that I felt about her. 

00:43:30
SIMON H. BUDMAN Well, let me then suggest that you just treat it very carefully, hid it, put it away, make sure that it's out of sight so then no one can take a look at it before we talk about together. 

00:43:45
ANGELICA Okay. 

00:43:45
SIMON H. BUDMAN Is that right? 

00:43:50
ANGELICA Sure. 

00:43:50
SIMON H. BUDMAN Alright. The other thing which I would like to ask you to do again if you could is to write a letter to me just writing a little bit about what's going on the session and your reaction to it. How the session has been for you, the things that has been useful to you, the things which may not have been so useful or things that you would like to see would be different the next time? 

00:44:10
ANGELICA I'll bring that when I come to... 

00:44:15
SIMON H. BUDMAN Or you cold mail that to me. 

00:44:15
ANGELICA Mail that to you. 

00:44:15
SIMON H. BUDMAN Yeah. I'll give you a card. So you can mail that to me. 

00:44:20
ANGELICA So it's a real letter. 

00:44:20
SIMON H. BUDMAN It's a real letter. 

00:44:20
ANGELICA Okay. 

00:44:20
SIMON H. BUDMAN To me. Is that all right? 

00:44:20
ANGELICA Sure. 

00:44:20
SIMON H. BUDMAN Okay. 

00:44:25
SIMON H. BUDMAN In closing this first session with Angelica there were a certain number of things that I wish to accomplish. 

00:44:25
SESSION SUMMARY NUMBER OF SESSIONS ESTABLISH A TIME FRAME HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS 

00:44:30
SIMON H. BUDMAN The first was the contract with her for an approximate number of sessions. I also want to establish a time frame for those visits. But most importantly, I wanted to give her some assignments to work on between sessions, specifically the letters to her mother and to me. 

00:44:50
SIMON H. BUDMAN Where a letter can be done. Ah I think it's a wonderful tool for the treatment because it really gives the person the opportunity to pull lot of aspects of what went on ah together for themselves and, and what I'm trying to do here is, is really a re-authoring process with their re-authoring things ah in their lives and themselves putting down this material in black and white and then mailing it. 

00:45:15
SIMON H. BUDMAN I think what we've done today is really take a first step with you that, ah... again as I said before I think a lot of this has been going on inside of your own head and I think that you've begun to take some of your own steps internally. And in some ways I think my role is really more alike the role of a mid-wife helping you sort of deliver some of these changes, but a lot of the changes I think are there ready to come forward. 

00:45:55
ANGELICA Uh huh. 

00:45:55
SIMON H. BUDMAN Because it's clear to me in talking with you today that that, that internally some of that time that you spent tossing and turning and trying to fall asleep but not being able fall asleep has been fairly productive time. You've gotten a lot of work done over this period of time in terms of your sleeplessness I think and have already taken some pretty significant steps yourself which I think is terrific. 

00:46:35
ANGELICA I never thought about it that way. 

00:46:35
SIMON H. BUDMAN Angelica did write her letter to me as I asked. It provides a good example of the value of this technique. Dear Dr. Budman at the conclusion of our session you had asked me to jot down a few of the positive and negative points as I saw them from our meeting. Since they're plentiful I will give the positives first. One, the letter to my mother was an excellent idea and it began writing immediately when I got home. When I was complete, I fell asleep for several hours. Two, it felt like a great relief to talk at all, since I had talked to anyone. Three, your suggestion to take things in steps was a good idea. Four, it felt good to hear that just seeking therapy was progress in itself because I've always thought of it as somewhat of a defeat. Five, although I didn't want to talk about Robert, you kept returning to my relationship with him. At the time this was uncomfortable because I felt like crying, something I've not done for years and don't feel comfortable with. However, it became clear that this was bothering and confusing me more than anything else. Six, the image that you used of yourself and your position as being the mid-wife would help me to deliver the change was wonderful. It was a clear and very and comforting thought, since it meant that my problem would be fixable with some effort from me and help from you. Seven, all in all, I found our meeting to be very encouraging and I felt that I was somewhat understood instead of feeling like a freak. This letter to you has been helpful to me since it kept my thought my process moving forward. There is no way that I can write down every thought that I had since leaving your office about the session. But hopefully, these few will be helpful. Thank you for your help and your encouragement. Thank you. Um so that was the letter that came from her in that session. I've not seen her again, but my view of what will go on with somebody like this woman is that she will be able to begin taking some preliminary steps and I don't know what those steps will be and it really have to come from her, but that, that she is going, going to begin ah the change process and that she is going to begin an active process of change, which might not have happened otherwise and I think that the input from me and the involvement with me helped get over that critical point at which the change begins to occur.
