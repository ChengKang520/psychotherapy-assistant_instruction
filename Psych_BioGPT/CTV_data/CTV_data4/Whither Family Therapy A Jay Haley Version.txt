TRIANGLE PRODUCTIONS Presents a film by Madeleine Richeport-Haley & Jay Haley This film is based on seminars, workshops, lectures, supervision sessions, and interviews done in different places around the world in the last 40 years. 

00:00:30
JAY HALEY You know, I was just thinking about something that had an effect to one… something in my personal life that had an effect, on my interest in families. I was born in the middle of an argument. The doctor was late and my father delivered me and my mother told me, he wasn’t doing it right? That's… That's absolutely true. 

00:01:00
WILLIAM DOHERTY So there was the triangle right away. 

00:01:00
JAY HALEY Right! 

00:01:05
Whither Family Therapy? A Jay Haley Haley Version 

00:01:10
JAY HALEY This is an 84-year-old woman who has a worst daughter-in-law in the history of the world. What could she say? And her son is being corrupted by this woman. She went to visit her son and wife and child and wouldn’t leave. Here is the wife (inaudible ) that she was gonna stay there, you know. So we decided to see the elderly lady first and produce a change in her. And then she would be acceptable with son and daughter-in-law and we could then bring them in and they would cooperate, because they saw something positive happening. A kid… An eight-year-old boy came in who had busted his teacher's nose and put in a hospital overnight with a concussion. And this kid has temper tantrums at home, because (inaudible ) the house. The task was relatively simple. You can solve this problem, if every time this kid starts with tamper tantrum you put him in his room(ph). To get the parents to do that, and they feel so helpless is a real problem. The kid started the tamper tantrum, the mother held the door, carried him up there, threw him in a room, held the door for half-an-hour. She send somebody for father, who came, put a better lock on, the kid broke up everything in the room and they emptied the room. And they did it about three times, the problem was over. This fireman brought in his wife who hadn’t been out of the house for years. She could go out with her mother or with him, but she couldn’t go out alone. So, he had to take the kids to school and take them to the doctor and all the sort of things. And I said, I wanted him when he went to work the next morning to tell his wife to stay home. In the next morning, he told her to stay home, and it was funny, ha…ha… they laughed about it. The next morning he told her to stay home, it wasn’t so funny, yeah. And the third morning he told her to stay home and she went out of the house to the grocery store for the first time in seven years. And when they came in at the next session, it was a very upset husband, saying, if my wife goes out alone, where is she gonna go and what is she gonna do? And the wife said, I’ve always said if I could leave this house, I'd leave with my suitcase in my hand. I had a woman come to me, who was starving(ph) to death, she was an older one. So I got in a trance she was a very good subject. So, what I did was, say to her that I wanted her have more training in hypnosis. I wanted her to examine her hand very carefully and noticed the colors of it and noticed that the forefinger is little larger than the little finger and so on. I went on and on talking about her hand. While I was saying the middle finger is a little different from the forefinger and ah… there is nothing more delicious than a peach when you bite into it and that juice comes into your mouth and the other side of the hand is different color than the back and went right on. But I dropped the suggestion in about a peach, in a way that she couldn’t do anything with it, because it was totally inappropriate. And she came in the next time and said you know, I had a funny kind of a thing, I’ve had this terrific training for peaches. And so I said, well as long as you like peaches what is the matter, and got her to eat a whole series of foods and gain weight without ever suggesting it directly.

1996 

00:04:40
JAY HALEY Well, I think this is a very exciting time therapy. It’s exciting because there’s no orthodoxy. There’s no way to do it that everybody agrees upon. The problem is if you don’t have an orthodoxy you can’t be a deviant, because everybody is doing it differently here, and there is no right way. And I think what you begin to realize is that, at this time everybody is gonna have to design their own therapy. You know for those of you who're not familiar with it, there is a very good book called the 'Discovery of the Unconscious' by Ellenberger. Where he describes what happened about 1880, when the therapist began to try to understand why some people did something and then said they couldn’t themselves. That is they would not be able to take a bath and say they can’t help themselves, or they… they'd not be able to stop bathing and say they couldn’t help themselves. Most symptoms tend to be opposites. You know, which is the basic clinical problem of symptomatic behavior. And they came up with three explanations. One was the unconscious, either it was created or discovered at that point, where they said a person was driven by unconscious ideas to do things and therefore consciously they didn’t know why they did it. And it seemed logical as if they read to make them conscious if they're unconscious, and Freud was born. There was another explanation, and that was multiple personality, that a person was doing something and didn’t know why, because another personality took over. There was a third explanation and that was spirit possession in 1880(ph) that a spirit possessed a person and told them to do things and they didn’t know why, because they couldn’t deal with the spirit. This is probably the most common explanation still worldwide, in Africa, China, South America, it's very big. 

00:06:55
1983 

00:06:55
JAY HALEY In Rio De Janeiro there are 40,000 spiritual centers and these are just the legal ones. They are very skillful at getting the spirit who possesses you to cure you. 

00:07:10
[sil.] 

00:07:15
Bali 1993 

00:07:15
JAY HALEY Usually, the emphasis seems to be on the individual as a problem. However, the family is often involved and so are colleagues. 

00:07:25
JAY HALEY What happened was it looks like at about 1900 the unconscious divided into those who said it was an unfortunate place with terrible ideas that you should watch out for. And those who said it was a positive force, that if you got out of the way you’re unconscious, you would do a lot better. 

00:07:40
Milton H. Erickson, MD 

00:07:45
JAY HALEY And that was represented by Erickson, who argued for a positive unconscious state(ph). And he would point out that a centipede who tries to walk consciously is in trouble. He also said that if he… if he misplaced something he didn’t look for it, because he assumed his unconscious had put it somewhere and would give it to him when he needed it. And that kind of confidence in an unconscious came out of Erickson. 

00:08:10
Gregory Bateson 1955 

00:08:10
JAY HALEY The theory most relevant to family therapy is systems theory. This was introduced in the 1940’s. 

00:08:15
Bateson Project 1955 

00:08:20
JAY HALEY The idea for therapy is that motivation is outside the person. What a person does is caused by what another person does. One's thoughts and feelings are said to be in the hands of other people. This was a special interest of Gregory Bateson and he explored human relations from that view in his research project. 

00:08:40
New Guinea 1936 

00:08:40
JAY HALEY He wrote his book in Naven in '36, which was about, it was very advanced for anthropology of that time. It was a… It was a tribe where the clans escalated. And in a like an arms race and then they had a ceremony that brought them down so they can start over again. And he was trying to describe that as a escalation and then a starting over in a systems way. He didn’t have the language for it. And when Whither came along with Cybernetics then it made sense to Bateson, so he began to apply and introduce it into psychiatry. 

00:09:15
JAY HALEY When Bateson studied Bali with Margaret Mead in the 1930’s, partly supported by a grant to study dementia praecox, they hypothesized that Balinese character was based on a particular sequence. 

00:09:30
1937 

00:09:30
JAY HALEY The mother stimulated the child and when it responded she would ignore it. This idea was remarkably similar to the hypothesis Bateson proposed in the 1950’s on his communication project. 

00:09:40
1951 

00:09:40
JAY HALEY He suggested that schizophrenia was caused by a double-bind, which occurs when parents communicate conflicting levels of message to the child. Such as the parents encouraging the child to respond and then objecting when he does. This was one of the few family hypothesis and it was clearly a way of thinking that Bateson had experienced for decades from Navern, to Bali, to Menlo Park. 

00:10:05
Zen 

00:10:10
JAY HALEY You and I in '53, well looking off for something to do, took that course on Alan Watts. He was then head of the Academy of Asian Studies. 

00:10:20
JOHN H. WEAKLAND Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:20
JAY HALEY And we took the course on the relationship between eastern philosophy and western psychiatry. 

00:10:25
John H. Weakland 

00:10:25
JAY HALEY And the idea of Zen that they were the tradition of 700 years of one person trying to change another. And what they were trying to do, and their assumptions about change being sudden and paradoxical. 

00:10:40
JOHN H. WEAKLAND Hmm…Hmm… 

00:10:40
JAY HALEY That whole set of idea, Watts had one subject which was paradox and he was very good on that subject. 

00:10:45
ALAN WATTS 1972 All those things are attempts to say this one thing, "darling, little child, you are required to do what will be acceptable only if you do it voluntarily." And everybody on this account is completely mixed up, because we are trying to force genuine behavior. 

00:11:15
JAY HALEY But he had a… really a powerful influence on us on those early days. Because at that point we began to look at therapy and we were looking for a different framework and there it was. Let me just read something. In this steps to ecology of mind, which was the collection of all his paradoxical at that time. He says, "the essays must speak for themselves, but here at the beginning let me state my belief, that such matters as the bilateral symmetry of an animal, the patterned arrangement of leaves in a plant, the escalation of an armaments race, the processes of courtship, the nature of play, the grammar of a sentence, the mystery of biological evolution and the contemporary crisis in man’s relationship to his environment, can only be understood in terms of such an ecology of ideas as I propose." 

00:12:10
JOHN H. WEAKLAND Well, that… it’s very large sweeping statement then. 

00:12:15
JAY HALEY But Bateson was interested in… in animal communication hoping that there would be fundamental ideas in that, that would be simpler than the complex ideas of humans. And his primary interest was in animals communicating about communication, simulating communication. And also he discovered with animal play that they had to know a message was a message in order to play, that this was a bite of play and not a bite of combat. It was to him a major idea. 

00:12:50
JOHN H. WEAKLAND Hmm…Hmm… 

00:12:50
1954 

00:12:50
GREGORY BATESON We shall go on in other films of this series to ask about people who have been so confused by their that 00:13:00]experiences that they cannot tell what sort of a message a message is. These are the people who are called schizophrenic and who exemplify, we believe, the state of man when he fails to discriminate that which is discriminated by (inaudible ). 

00:13:27
JAY HALEY It was an era when people began to study animals in their natural environment and we began to study individuals in their natural environment with a family. 

00:13:35
JOHN H. WEAKLAND Both of those approaches are very similar to anthropology and no doubt of it. 

00:13:45
JAY HALEY Sure. 

00:13:45
JOHN H. WEAKLAND And very different from conventional psychiatry. 

00:13:50
JAY HALEY That's right. 

00:13:50
1959 

00:13:50
GREGORY BATESON An anthropologist's job is to make sense of what people do, whether it be in New Guinea in rituals or in mental hospitals here at this country or in suburban homes. And perhaps the most frightening thing about mental illness is that it doesn’t make sense. And what we are doing in Palo Alto is studying the settings in which people become mentally ill in order to think about the conditions and the sort of sense that particularly schizophrenia makes. 

00:14:35
Schizophrenia 

00:14:40
JAY HALEY In the 1950’s that’s how we thought of schizophrenia in terms of communication. We would try to understand what they were saying in their metaphors and how it related to their living situation. 

00:14:50
JAY HALEY I was talking to a psychiatric resident who said if you're interested in communication you should talk to this guy, a patient. So, I started talking to the patient. 

00:15:00
Mony Elkaim, MD 

00:15:00
JAY HALEY He said he was from Mars, that his… his mother was… That his name was Margaret Truman or Margaret Stallone or somebody. But nobody knew who he was. He had been in a state hospital and I began to talk to him. And he had an interesting way of talking. And he had an extraordinary skill that works for a guy who had a third grade education. He was a migratory labor. That's what he was. 

00:15:30
1954 

00:15:35
Now see I hold the leg like that. I hope that he did actually know what the contents of that letter. Well, looking at the contents of it (inaudible ). 

00:15:45
JAY HALEY Why do you want to do that? 

00:15:45
Because I want to show you (inaudible ). It's on the (inaudible ) (inaudible ) 

00:16:01
JAY HALEY This young man might have been the cause of family therapy even though his family had disappeared at this time and was not available for therapy. As the Bateson group began to study his special ways of communicating, we decided to investigate people called schizophrenic. That led to interviewing families with the member diagnosed schizophrenic as well as other types of families and attempting to change them and relieve their distress. 

00:16:25
…and for nearly 60 years… 

00:16:30
JAY HALEY Hey (inaudible ) letter? 

00:16:31
Because I'm an Australian. 

00:16:35
JAY HALEY What are you trying to tell? 

00:16:35
I'm talking about. 

00:16:35
JAY HALEY Talking about what? 

00:16:35
About opening letter up and reading. 

00:16:40
JAY HALEY We started on a concern with perception that could he perceive correctly or not, which is the way people were thinking of schizophrenia. Then we shifted more to how this was a communication to somebody else. It wasn’t just as perception and that it was a metaphor, which he was creating. And that got us interested in the metaphors of schizophrenia. 

00:17:05
Schizophrenia and Hypnosis 

00:17:05
JAY HALEY And we were studying schizophrenia, so we got interested in whether there was a similarity between schizophrenia and hypnotic phenomena, because you could produce hallucinations with hypnosis. You can produce voices, you can have 'em hear a voice or anything that a schizophrenic can do you can do with hypnosis with a normal person. So we got interested in, was there a parallel between the way a hypnotist's work with a subject to produce this in a way parents raise their child who became schizophrenic. Milton Erickson, the master, we… I learned hypnosis from him. And he was the hypnotist of the country, the medical hypnotist of the country really. We spent time with him talking about differences and similarities between trans experience and schizophrenic. 

00:17:55
1964 

00:18:00
MILTON H. ERICKSON And now take a deep breath for a while, awake and refreshed and energetic. By the way, what is your name? 

00:18:15
PAT (ph) Pat(ph)! 

00:18:15
MILTON H. ERICKSON What is it? 

00:18:15
PAT (ph) Pat(ph)! 

00:18:20
MILTON H. ERICKSON Do you honestly put your hand up in midair like that? 

00:18:20
PAT (ph) No, it's unusual. 

00:18:25
MILTON H. ERICKSON Then why are you keeping it up there now? 

00:18:30
PAT (ph) Well, I don’t know. 

00:18:30
MILTON H. ERICKSON You don't know? 

00:18:30
PAT (ph) No! 

00:18:30
JAY HALEY This is an example of the subtle use of communication by Erickson. He would awaken subjects and they would still be in a trance. Apparently, he said to awake, but actually he said the subject should feel like she was awake. She feels awake while still in the trance. 

00:18:50
JAY HALEY We investigated that the two most therapists most concerned with power. The two therapists most concerned with power in that decade was John Rosen and Milton Erickson. 

00:19:05
JOHN ROSEN , MD 1955 You know it’s difficult to talk to you, you are afraid to think. 

00:19:10
[sil.] 

00:19:15
(inaudible ). 

00:19:16
JOHN ROSEN Yeah! The way you think, look how crazy you got. Look how crazy you are now. 

00:19:25
[sil.] 

00:19:35
JOHN ROSEN (Inaudible ) boy. Loosen up, loosen up, smile. You can smile, can't you? Can you smile? 

00:19:50
JAY HALEY But you know the big step that we took and Bateson took, which was a hard step, it seems easy now perhaps. But we considered for two or three years the double-bind as a ideological matter, that it was something that happened in the history of the kid when… in the childhood. And that the adults schizophrenic was a walking scar over that in some way. It was when we brought a family together with a patient that for the first time we saw that this could be considered currently instigated… 

00:20:20
JOHN H. WEAKLAND Yeah! 

00:20:20
JAY HALEY …or currently (inaudible ). 

00:20:24
JOHN H. WEAKLAND Hmm…Hmm… 

00:20:25
JAY HALEY And that was a tremendous idea. That was a new idea in the world, really, at that time in… in psychiatry or therapy, because everybody was focused on the path and the programming of the path. 

00:20:35
JAY HALEY I was supervised by Don Jackson, who was an excellent clinician particularly with schizophrenics. 

00:20:40
JAY HALEY And he was beginning to work with their families. He had been supervised personally by Sullivan. And Jackson, when supervising me with a schizophrenic, I had always deal with the question, what was I doing when the patient began to act this way? And it built in an interpersonal concern. 

00:21:00
DON D. JACKSON , MD 1959 I think the big difference is one that the public doesn't usually think about and that is that, these individuals were not only mentally ill, but they had been residents of a hospital for many years. In a hospital they lose all sense of identity, their personal belonging taken away, they are on a schedule that is not of their own choosing. They’re treated as if they were crazy and naturally over a period of time, it has an effect. What is a great argument going on in science and in psychiatry about whether it takes more pressure to produce serious mental illness or whether the individual is weaker to begin with, because of some inherited defect or something the matter with his glands(ph), his chemistry, and this is far from being settled. 

00:21:50
WILLIAM DOHERTY , PhD So you had a… you had these… that you had the cybernetics, you had anthropology coming in. 

00:21:55
JAY HALEY Yeah. 

00:21:55
WILLIAM DOHERTY You had communication and film, you had all of these. You had Zen religion, all of these. 

00:22:00
JAY HALEY That's right and hypnosis. 

00:22:05
WILLIAM DOHERTY All of these and hypnosis, all of these coming together, so it must have been a very exciting time? 

00:22:10
JAY HALEY Well, it was a very exciting time. Later in the fall of… of '56, I began to see a family, only not as family therapy. I had a patient, one of the guys we were seeing individually, who had a problem with his parents. That when they had visited him in the hospital he had fainted and he collapsed on the… on the hospital ground, this was at the VA Hospital. And then his parents would go off to the ward and get and aide and come back. The aide would say get up and he… and he'd get up and go back to the ward. And he couldn’t stay with his parents more than five minutes without fainting. And I’m busy doing therapy with him. Had the problem that he didn’t think he could leave the hospital without going to his family, go back home with his parents. And I was trying to help and get out of the hospital, but I figured he isn’t gonna make it, if he can’t be with his parents more than five minutes. So, I brought his parents in with him for a session. And he stood up against the wall like you scared at that. And I had a session in which he managed to get through the hour. So I asked him to come back again, we had another session. And that was when we began to take the recordings of that and realized the possibility that we weren't talking about an etiological theory of expecting punishment and so on, we were… that this could be currently caused. 

00:23:40
WILLIAM DOHERTY Hmm…Hmm… 

00:23:40
JAY HALEY And that was a tremendous step for us. It was also an education to realize what they actually did in that family. I mean, not what the parents did, but this young man did something that I though was extraordinary. He sent his mother a Mother’s Day card, which said, "you've always been like a mother to me." 

00:24:05
[sil.] 

00:24:10
JAY HALEY And she brought that letter into the session. She said that, "there's something wrong with this card!" And she couldn’t clarify what was it, what's wrong with it. That was a fall of '56, by '57, I had a family and we were officially doing, in the spring we were officially doing family therapy. 

00:24:30
1957 

00:24:30
JAY HALEY After that all the members of the Basin Project began to do therapy with families. By the early 1960’s, there were a variety approaches to family therapy around the country. Each approach had its leader, such as Murray Bowen Virginia Satir, Salvador Minuchin, Carl Whitaker and others. They had in common a therapy focused on the family rather than the individual, whatever the psychological or other type of problem. 

00:25:05
JAY HALEY That if we’re talking about outcome in family therapy, we want to know if the family has changed. 

00:25:10
Family Research 

00:25:15
JAY HALEY And this becomes an interesting problem. I spent five years in at the MRI, comparing different kinds of families and different kind of experimental settings… 

00:25:20
1965 

00:25:25
JAY HALEY …trying to answer the question whether a family with an abnormal member was different from what family with normal members is? But we also got into the question, has the family changed? Which means you need to test before a therapy over the family within(ph) there and then you need to test afterwards. 

00:25:40
Hmm…Hmm… 

00:25:40
1995 

00:25:45
JAY HALEY It would be preferable not to have one that is the opinion of the family members, because it's… you wanna an experimental one that shows hard data that there has been a change. One of the things you come to is that there isn’t a class of abnormal families and there’s a class of normal families in the usual sense that you can say this abnormal family was turned into a normal family. What you have is the problem of the change in each family, which means you need to test in which the family does something together, you put 'em through therapy, you then have the family do something together and you show or don’t show a change. You know there is another theory that came out of this century and that is the family lifecycle. The idea of that symptoms don’t occur randomly in the life of a family that they cluster at certain points. And that makes it possible to think of helping people get past a stage in life that the symptom is preventing them from getting there. 

00:26:45
JAY HALEY An example of a problem stage in family life is when a young person leaves home. The parents are then faced only with each other. This can be a pleasant time for them, but it can also be a time where there’s severe problems. If the young person becomes incapacitated, he or she doesn’t leave home or they keep returning. 

00:27:10
1972 

00:27:10
JAY HALEY Therapy can be necessary to prevent a daughter from helping the family by being a serious problem, and then the family does not get past this stage. 

00:27:20
JAY HALEY What would she put in forward you know? 

00:27:20
Often crazy, delusions, (inaudible ) the doctor said two of fetuses(ph) locked up and sometimes and were letting her have them. She was hearing voices (inaudible ). 

00:27:36
JAY HALEY But you’re… What… Your working process would be getting them to decide when she goes home, what she’s gonna do, you’re getting 'em to hold together and getting her to do what she should in the room or out of the room. And then getting 'em to treat her like a girl who needs to get back to school (inaudible ) in life rather than a girl who's sick. Really what you push forward is to define there is a behavior problem ultimately if not from repression(ph) rather than an illness problem. 

00:28:05
JAY HALEY The problem is that people protect each other, that a kid will harm himself to help the parents. You also have to develop a theory of motivation. 

00:28:15
JAY HALEY And I think the theory of repression is probably the worst theory that ever came along for a therapist on why people do what they do. That it's really much better to think that the problem is that people help each other and they help each other by harming themselves and that’s the problem. 

00:28:35
Directive Therapy 

00:28:35
JAY HALEY I was fortunate in having access to Erickson, who for many years talked about his cases and essentially he was teaching me how to give directives in the way he talked about the cases. One of the things I did, which I think a number of people did, it was against the law almost to tell anybody what to do back in the 50’s. And I was a hypnotist, hypnotherapist as well as a family therapist. And I could hypnotize somebody and tell him what to do and that was okay, as long as you hypnotize him first. But then I found out that I didn’t have to hypnotize him, I could just tell him what to do, and the same thing happened. So that I began to give up to hypnosis and do more and more of just the direction. You know in a way to think about it is the directive is a way of dealing with a client. It… It is… The purpose of it is not to get the directive follow, it's to have a process of talking with client. An example, I like is one of Erickson’s where he had a… a woman came in with her 50-year-old son, and she said her problem was her son would just hung on her all the time and wouldn’t leave her at all, she couldn’t even read a book, because he nagged at her all the time. And so, Erickson told the woman to get in her car with the son and to drive out into the desert and to push her son out of car, since she was stronger than this guy. And push him out of the car and to drive one mile and park and sit in that air-conditioned car and read her book. And he… he said, your son will be angry and jumping up and down, but it's hot out there, and he is gonna walk and the exercise will be good for him, and he is gonna walk to the car. So the woman did it and the guy walked to the car. And the next day woman did it again and the guy walked to the car. And then they came in to see Erickson. And the guy said, "isn’t there some other exercise I could do besides walking in that hot dessert?" And Erickson said, "well, what do you have in mind?" And the guy said, "couldn’t we go bowling, and I’ll bowl while mother sits up in the stands and reads her book?" Erickson said, "that wouldn’t be fine." And he did a series of tasks like that with this mother and her 50-year-old son, without any discussion of how they got the way they are or what the purposes were or what their motivation was. But as he gives the task, they then talk about the task and it gives them a way of relating around that instead of… instead of motivation or something like that. I think there’s two kinds of directives, among the many ways of classifying two ways is possible, and that is straightforward directives where you just tell somebody what to do, and the indirect directives, where you go around the corner to get 'em to do something. And I think the… the choice depends entirely on your authority, your power, that if people will change if you tell 'em to change, then why not. Like will you give a client advice? Whether you'll coach people? There is also penance, an ordeal being where you have a person do something that’s good for him, but harder on them than the symptom and they’ll give up the symptoms. With many cases of symptoms where a person says, I can’t help myself. And therefore, to tell him to do something, they'd say, I can’t do it because I can’t help myself. And therefore, you have to bring in the family, which is an indirect maneuver or you have to go into a… an indirect directive. The indirect ones are mostly around paradox and metaphor. 

00:32:30
Paradox 

00:32:30
RICHARD RABKIN How do you describe how one goes about creating a paradoxical task(ph)? Is there… 

00:32:35
1973 

00:32:40
JAY HALEY When you always do it, you… you try to setup exactly the problem they come in with. If it’s for an individual, it’s exactly the symptomatic behavior, if it's for a family, it's exactly the sequence they follow. And then you prescribe that, you may not get there immediately. I’ve got a nice little film that is fresh in my mind, because I was looking at that, I did it years ago. It’s called 'Only on Sunday'. And it’s a film with a ten-year-old boy who's… he had several years of therapy including therapy with a guy that I know who has recently come to Maine(ph). And (inaudible ) whether he could think of another work, so when it came to us we did a paradoxical procedure with him, which was… I made the film to show to stages of this, because what you do is you clarify, the first thing you do is you clarify in your old thinking what’s your goal is. Because if you use an effective method of therapy you're liable to get there, you know, so you better be very specific in it. 

00:33:35
1970 

00:33:35
Well, what I'd like to do (inaudible ) and that is to… for us to have an agreement on a… on something, that is that you don’t be a problem(ph) thing between James and myself. If I see you most (inaudible ) that you don’t enjoy. Well, I'm gonna tell you, right? I mean, sitting with James and you’re wasting your time. Do you know what I'm saying? Do it on Sundays. Now man, now here's what you do. Now you did a four times less, right? Now… Now that you’re gonna enjoy it, you know, you guys will go ahead and do it more, right? Okay! So, now this for me, this is something you know, I want you to do? I want you do it eight times, okay? I want you do it eight times now. So, you might have to get up a little early to start. 

00:34:30
JAY HALEY With all these people trying to get him to stop, the boy was in a position of being pushed back(ph) and beginning to rebel against, which is what you’re after with a paradoxical procedure. The boy cut down… and didn’t keep the track of the paper, came in very cheerfully, hadn’t done what he shouldn’t have, the therapist was very hard on him and he had to do it on Monday and he had to do it on Tuesday, and he had to do it… (inaudible ). And it sounds hard, except that’s what the boy was doing anyhow. And then we gave him a week without any instructions and let up on it, and that was essentially the problem. 

00:34:55
Richard Rabkin, MD 

00:34:55
JAY HALEY I did a five-year follow up on this case, because I was curious what happened. And he uh… He had dropped this at… at that time according to his mother. Erickson developed in… in a variety of ways. 

00:35:10
Metaphor 

00:35:10
JAY HALEY One of the ones he'd like to do that I always like is he would take a couple and couldn’t talk about something like sex. They wanted to do some changing about it, but they couldn’t talk about it. So, he'd say to them that he wanted them to talk about other things. And he wanted to talk to them about having dinner together, and how very important it is that a couple enjoy dinner together. The wife should enjoy the dinner, the husband should enjoy the dinner. And he asked them how they have dinner? Did they have it… did they have it by candlelight or did they do it just anywhere in the house? And, then he says, "do you like appetizers to start the juices flowing or do you like to dive right into meat and potatoes?" And he does that thing on dinner that parallel sex. And I guess if they become aware of it at all, you should drop it or change, because this is to work outside their awareness, and which is where part of the ethical issue comes up. And you should also do one more thing that many of people don’t know and that is you need to take a position yourself. You need to say it's important that you enjoy dinner together, that everybody should, every couple should dinner together. That is, you don’t just comment, you… you take a position and say what ought to be done. And anyway if you do that correctly, the couple would come in and have made some changes in their sexual relationship and will think they originated that. They think they initiated it and you'll think you initiated it, but who knows who initiated. 

00:36:55
The Ethical Case 

00:36:55
JAY HALEY I was on Gregory Bateson’s research project and we were housed in a VA Hospital, and we shared a research building with some young people who were stalling what ultimately became behavior therapy. Somebody, maybe Skinner, had an extraordinary idea that you could take the way that you can manipulate animals with positive reinforcements and increase their behavior, they got the idea that you could do that with human beings, and that you could use the therapist as a reinforcement. I mean, it sounds kind of obvious once you think of it, but that was an extraordinary leap that somebody made there, in the history of therapy. And the staff was all made up of psychoanalysts with a training director who was an old analyst. And he… two young men in their research said they wanted to present something and they did to this group. They said, they had discovered or somebody had discovered, that if you want a patient to behave in a certain way, you reward him whenever he behaves that way. Like if you want a patient to express more emotions, then whenever he expresses emotions, you smile and nod, if he doesn’t express an emotion, you don’t respond. And they say, if you do this for an hour, you’ll have a very emotional patient there. And the training director got angry and said, this is the behavior of a cat that it is optionally improper for you to deliberately influence a patient, that’s wrong. And to do it outside the patient’s awareness is doubly wrong, this is just impossible and it shouldn’t be done. And I remember one of the young men defended himself by saying, will you do it anyhow? That is when the patient does what you like you tend to respond, smiling and positive and when he doesn’t do what you like you don’t respond. And the old analyst said, if you do it and you don’t know you’re doing it, it's alright. And that issue is still very much with us, with every single one of you people. Should you deliberately influence somebody and should you do it outside their awareness? 

00:39:10
JAY HALEY More typically, people are aware when they are given a directive. 

00:39:15
NEIL P. SCHIFF, PHD You need something to do. And I’m gonna tell you where it is and I don’t expect anybody to complain about it or anything else, even though it’s a terrible thing, it’ll help, okay? Again, that is if she’s threatening herself or somebody else, it means she's not thinking properly and the only way to handle this is for all of you to stay with her at home for the following 24-hour period. 

00:39:40
Teaching Therapy 

00:39:40
JAY HALEY Family therapists developed a unique way of training with the use of the one-way mirror. Besides merely talking about cases, it became possible to see what actually happens in therapy. The supervisor plans the interview with the trainee in advance and telephone suggestions during the interview. In the early 1970s, it became possible to videotape interviews and go over the recordings with the trainee. It was also possible to make films on how to do therapy. Two of the first films were by Braulio Montalvo and by me. I made a film of the family therapy with a child with a dog phobia(ph). 

00:40:20
Braulio Montalvo 1972 

00:40:20
JAY HALEY Braulio Montalvo solved a fire-setting problem with a family approach. 

00:40:25
BRAULIO MONTALVO Okay? Now, I'd like you to hold mommy’s hands, okay. Now mommy is gonna teach you how to play with matches, so that you don’t get hurt and so that you don’t hurt anybody, okay. 

00:40:40
JAY HALEY I learned a lot from training those people from the community. Because I think therapy came out of educational institutions. 

00:40:45
Salvador Minuchin, MD 

00:40:50
JAY HALEY And educational institutions are full of intellectuals who think that awareness and knowledge of oneself transforms himself and so on. And when you train people off the street, they really don’t have that idea. I remember Peter Clark(ph) had a mother who never lead her… she had a 12-year-old son that she never let out of the house, because possibly he was retarded with, not very great. She walked into school, she volunteered in the lunchtime, so she watched him in the schoolyard and she walked him home after school, she kept him in the house. Now, she described this to be, he never once suggested that that she was in anyway overprotecting the child. And he began to say, you know a kid his age really should begin to learn how to be out on the street. And suppose you could sit on the front porch while he was just on the street right in front of her, she said, "yeah, I guess I get him". He then got that kid out in the street, had him down to playing basketball within two or three sessions, with the woman very pleased. Now, if he had said to her, "you see what you’re doing, you’re restraining this boy from going out, you’re overprotecting and you’re keeping him." He helped her understand what she was doing to the boy as many therapists would have in those days. I don’t think he would have had any kind of trouble with this woman. Now, that would… What interested me is that never occurred to him. He didn’t think that pointing anything out that to this woman would change her. 

00:42:15
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Yeah, but you see it never occurred to him, because in this culture that’s not what people do. 

00:42:20
JAY HALEY Exactly. 

00:42:20
SALVADOR MINUCHIN You know, so that he did the kind of thing that was absolutely correct to make the woman change. 

00:42:25
JAY HALEY And in the… And in the intellectual culture in the university… 

00:42:30
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Yeah! 

00:42:30
JAY HALEY …that’s the way you learn to do is to point out that people (inaudible ) doing so they'll understand themselves. 

00:42:36
SALVADOR MINUCHIN But you know, then the question is how do you then, if you’re working with people with different cultures, you do use and… and if your goal is to help them to behave differently you enter through the avenues that are more available. 

00:43:00
JAY HALEY Well, you know that’s also the time, (inaudible ) crusading idea of doing something for the poor that came into, that was also the Vietnam War. And I remember the staff gradually led by Neal Daniels walking off with their banners in the antiwar crusade. 

00:43:15
SALVADOR MINUCHIN It… It was… It was a political group. It was a very commuted film that had political ideas and ideas of involvement in social issues. So that family therapy was part of those people, yeah. 

00:43:30
JAY HALEY Was part of that. It was part of the time, you know. I remember that scene when they were gonna burn my film, when they… those young black girls made that film and the black people in the community were organized, said they wanted that film burned, because it showed black life that way, which was what the girls showed with their life. 

00:43:50
1972 

00:43:50
JAY HALEY It was a… It was a research project in which the young people black and white and middleclass and poor. We'd give them movie cameras and taught to use them and just allowed to film anything they wanted to film to see how did they perceive the world. What would they put on film, how would they perceive the world? And this group of girls from that neighborhood wrote a play. 

00:44:15
Take the child, leave me alone. As film starts what I'm going to do to take my baby with me. 

00:44:20
It’s a shame the baby has to struggle because of you. Why don’t you give the baby (inaudible ) then you can rather speak with (inaudible ) then you're no better. Get out from my house right now, we’ll kind of challenge to old mother. 

00:44:35
You were never a mother than me, never than me. I'll leave (inaudible ). 

00:44:40
JAY HALEY She took her baby to live in a pad where all the girls live together. 

00:44:45
JAY HALEY And then I showed it to the staff, expecting the staff to be so pleased. And the black staff looked at the reality of those girls' life and they were horrified. And they said, that film can't be shown and it's gotto be destroyed. And they came to be and said it had to be burned that day. And I said we won’t burn that film, it's up to the girls what they do with their film. And certainly we wouldn’t were gonna burn it and they… we had a discussion and they were gonna burn the clinic and… 

00:45:15
SALVADOR MINUCHIN You remember that. 

00:45:15
JAY HALEY Yeah, I remember that and I remember you just took a position obviously you weren’t gonna burn that film. And we went through quite a struggle. And out of that, I… I remember them, they brought the mothers of the girls in to see that film. And the mothers were rather pleased with the film and that the girls could do as well with music and titles (inaudible ). 

00:45:35
SALVADOR MINUCHIN Yeah! The… The mothers were pleased, they felt that the girls had been competent. 

00:45:40
Issues of the 1990’s 

00:45:40
JAY HALEY It would be interesting as a (inaudible ), but it's a task to make a diagnostic manual as for therapist not for the institutions and the insurance companies and so on. And whom I never accepted, I don’t know, whether it would be very good for training, because you would begin to find symptoms falling out in terms of certain ways to deal with them in order to get people over them. 

00:46:05
You wouldn’t have to do the entire job to start with. 

00:46:10
JAY HALEY Well there is another issue, we didn’t use to have, and that’s compulsory therapy. The fact that the court orders people to go to therapy raised not only rights issues, but the nature of therapy issues. And I think it does deal with the question of who's the agent are you? The way you once were the agent of an individual and wouldn't even talk with the family on the phone, then we were the agent of the family against the community in the 60's. And when you are seeing people ordered by the State to straighten this person out, you are an agent of the State, you can’t get around it. And I think some kind of a clear position should be taken on this. A therapy was built upon the European immigrants. And now we have the Asian immigrants and the South American immigrants. In a local elementary school near me, they had a multicultural day and the kids all came in their costumes. And there were a 187 cultural groups and a lot of those were heading for therapy. 

00:47:20
JAY HALEY Once it was realized that a supervisor can watch and interview from the next room, it became evident that one can observe from several rooms away by using a camera and a monitor. In fact, we have observed interviews from the other side of the country and telephone suggestions to the therapist. Now, by satellite, teachers of therapy are available to the world. 

00:47:40
WILLIAM DOHERTY Well the… the final question… 

00:47:45
JAY HALEY Sure. 

00:47:45
WILLIAM DOHERTY …that I ask everyone is about how you see your legacy or you'd like to see your legacy to future generations of family therapists? 

00:47:50
JAY HALEY A legacy? 

00:47:55
WILLIAM DOHERTY Yeah. 

00:47:55
JAY HALEY You mean what I like to be remembered for? 

00:48:00
WILLIAM DOHERTY Yeah! He's always reframing. 

00:48:00
JAY HALEY I want to be remembered as the oldest living teacher of therapy.
