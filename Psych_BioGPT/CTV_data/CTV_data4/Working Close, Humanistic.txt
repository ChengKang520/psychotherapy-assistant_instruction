"Working Close" With Resistance to Client Presence James F.T. Bugental, PhD 

00:01:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Well, I'm sitting here reflecting . Can it be louder? How's that? No, can we get it louder? It's important, is possible, to amplify it louder because when we're demonstrating we don't wanna be projecting. Better? 

00:01:35
UNKNOWN No. 

00:01:40
MOLLY STERLING They need to make it louder. 

00:01:40
UNKNOWN Hold the mic out. 

00:01:40
MOLLY STERLING Can you hear me? 

00:01:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Hello? 

00:01:45
UNKNOWN Yes! 

00:01:45
MOLLY STERLING What about me? Can you hear me? 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN No. 

00:01:55
MOLLY STERLING Gonna do it. Is that better? 

00:01:55
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:02:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL How we doin' now? Okay. It sort of fits in with what I was reflecting about. It's, it says something about where we are as a species, as a science, as an art, as a discipline devoted to human well-being that we ask ourselves to move from confronting the horror of the holocaust and take a ten, fifteen, twenty minute break and suddenly put that aside and move to another topic. We're used to making ourselves machines; turn it on, turn it off. So you're supposed to turn it off and we're supposed to turn it off up here. If there's a capsule way of illustrating or typifying the kind of work that I want to try to demonstrate this afternoon it's the opposite of that turn it on, turn it off. We have a relatively limited time. I'm going to make some framing com, comments so that you can have a perspective for watching what we do. We hope the time will permit not only a demonstration with my associate, Misses Sterling, but with maybe one or, very unlikely, but possibly two other people. If you're interested in being one of those persons I'm going to ask that you, first of all, not volunteer if you're presently in therapy. That gets rid of a lot of you, doesn't it? Second, and this will take care of the rest of you, if you're in any major life-issue at this time. Now if you've survived those two, the third is that you will accept the responsibility, if we do work together, to stop our work at any time without any need to explain or do anything except say I want to stop. You see, if you will do that than I'll be freer to do what I do but since I will not have know you before I can't monitor the same way I would with someone I've been working with. Now, if, if several of you would like to volunteer, I'm now going to ask Misses Sterling to go over here and meet you by this stairway while I make these framing comments. If you can pat your head and rub your tummy at the same time, you can listen as you go volunteer. 

00:04:55
MOLLY STERLING But, I, I can't interview more than three to five people -- 

00:05:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah, max. 

00:05:00
MOLLY STERLING So, once there are that many people up here, we'll have to try to fit another time in, I think. 

00:05:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Good. We've titled it Working Close with Patients to try to talk about a particular circumstance in our work. Let me begin, then, by describing the kind of therapy that I'm, that we're working, ah, is our working model here. First of all, generally it's long-term, depth therapy, therapy that is, ah, often frequent. Ah, before inflation made it so impossible, I liked to see people three or four times a week, at least, when we began. That's just not possible for many people today, but once is, is, ah, is really not very satisfying for this kind of work and twice a week is kind of minimal. Now some people can't even do that financially and when that's the case I usually try to have them take on a discipline of journaling regularly or a meditational discipline; something else that intrudes on their life schedule. And I mean intrude; gets in the way of their usual life schedule and calls for them to listen to themselves, to turn within. This therapy seeks to help people change established life patterns. John Doe comes to the office and first session, and he says, I recently blew up at my boss and go fired and I, I, that troubles me. I need help with that. And then I need to know, this is terribly over-simplified, I need to know, is this the, a unique experience in John's life or, as we talk, is there a history of repeated angry outbursts, failures of relationships? If it's the former, perhaps a more short-term effort would be useful. If it's the latter, I would think it presumptuous to try to help John change a well-established pattern he's been practicing maybe 30 years in 60 minutes or 50 minutes or 45 minutes an hour, ah, a week. This kind of therapy is characterized too by intensive therapist commitment. Not just the client commitment, as I indicated a minute ago, but therapist commitment. A readiness to really involve oneself as a total person. In choosing people with whom to work in this way, I'm always concerned about ego functioning, since the depth-work can be too threatening, too disorienting if there is not adequate ego functioning. That doesn't fit neat DSM3 categories. Ah, it's something that has to be assessed with each individual, at least in my experience, and the, the, um, five, five unit code may or may not represent the differences. And finally, this kind of therapy has at school(sp), not cure, but helping the client to live more fully, more satisfyingly, less distressed. Now we said working close to help clients with resistance to full presences so we're talking about one phase of the, of the depth-therapy enterprise. Um, I think of these as like the markings in music, you know? You have vivaci(sp) and you have leg, legato and so one. These phases are, are expressive, ah, capture the, the mood or spirit of various phases of the work. Some of the other kinds of phases, ah, early on with John Doe, for instance, ah, receiving the client as innocently as possibly would be an, a, a phase of the work, where I try to empty myself to experience this unique person in his, her uniqueness. Another one is when we're trying to teach therapeutic patterns to clients. How, how to work in this kind of therapy. A third is when we're working with the client, has difficulty making a full commitment to the enterprise. Um, another kind of marking an expressive marking, if you would, is helping support the client through intervals of panic or depression or impulse containment. And, ah, perhaps one more, an important one that often grows out of the period we're gonna be focusing on now, is where we're trying to work through the transference, counter-transference collusion and arrive at some greater understanding of this particular person's way of being in his, her life. But the, where we're devoting our attention now is that phase of the work, in long-time work, where the client has already achieved a major of, ah, understanding of the task, has learned to look within rather than to me for answers, and needs to be, ah, supported and coached, encouraged in further self-exploration. Molly Sterling, who is my associate now, has been through, ah, a training program that we ran some years ago, ah, is herself a licensed therapist, but has had a lot of therapy of several kinds and is familiar with this, so she's by no means a newcomer to it. This, ah, we're not pretending this is, ah, the way we would start out with someone, but perhaps, because she's willing to work this way, you can see something of how the work goes later on. Molly, I've asked you to think of something you'd like to work with, ah, for awhile here, and let's do that now. First of all, let's see how about the transition. How's it feel? 

00:11:40
MOLLY STERLING Huh, ha, ha. It's probably what I'll bring up. Um, one, there is one thing I'd like to say, though, before we begin, which is that when Jim and I talked about doing this I offered to do it because, ah, he knows my resist, my ways of resisting as well as anybody and that can be so subtle. And working at that level of subtlety, I think, is often hard to demonstrate. So, ah, we're deliberately going to put it as far out into the edge of that as we can. 

00:12:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Breathe for a minute. 

00:12:25
[sil.] 

00:12:30
MOLLY STERLING Okay. 

00:12:35
MOLLY STERLING I think, of course, my, my biggest concern right now is simply being-- 

00:12:45
UNKNOWN Can't hear you. Can't hear. 

00:12:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Can we build up the volume, 'cuz I didn't want her to have to project. That distracts too much. 

00:12:55
UNKNOWN Put the mic on the other side. 

00:12:55
MOLLY STERLING I've got to-- 

00:13:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Maybe put it in, onto your collar? 

00:13:05
[sil.] 

00:13:05
MOLLY STERLING That work? That better? 

00:13:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Better? Good. 

00:13:10
MOLLY STERLING Okay. 

00:13:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Take time for the trans finish(sp). 

00:13:20
MOLLY STERLING It, ah, obviously the, the most difficult thing in my moment, at the moment, is to be here. 

00:13:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:13:25
MOLLY STERLING In front of everyone doing this, being this public, this publicly. It's, ah, I want to quell the fear and stand it. 

00:13:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. How's it going? 

00:13:45
MOLLY STERLING Hmm. A little bit of both. 

00:13:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:13:50
MOLLY STERLING Ah, you know, I, there is, my heart beating down in my stomach and, and, and actually, you know, it's worse before it starts. 

00:14:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:14:05
MOLLY STERLING I mean-- 

00:14:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Once you start it does help. 

00:14:05
MOLLY STERLING Yeah. 

00:14:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah. 

00:14:05
MOLLY STERLING Um-hmm. 

00:14:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah. 

00:14:10
[sil.] 

00:14:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I can see your breathing change. 

00:14:15
MOLLY STERLING Um-hmm. I'm hanging on. I mean, I'm hanging onto you. 

00:14:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Fair enough. Yeah. 

00:14:25
[sil.] 

00:14:25
MOLLY STERLING It's like, where should, ah, I, I should go somewhere else next. 

00:14:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:14:40
MOLLY STERLING I should, um-- 

00:14:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Let me suggest, Molly, take note of the should, hang it on the wall and just be here with all the people and everything and, and trust what comes up. 

00:14:50
MOLLY STERLING Even the, the should is part of being here with the people, you know? 

00:14:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Definitely. 

00:14:55
MOLLY STERLING I mean, the, there's a production that should, should begin to happen about now. It's not, and-- 

00:15:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:15:10
[sil.] 

00:15:20
UNKNOWN A very, um, quiet and like, ah, there's a, a blank inside but it's almost pregnant. 

00:15:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Hmm. Um-hmm. Be with that flag(sp). 

00:15:40
MOLLY STERLING I wanna give form-- 

00:15:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:15:50
MOLLY STERLING And, um, there's a tie, there's a funny kind of edge of, this is a kind of place where I would tend to cry only I am not. 

00:16:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:16:15
MOLLY STERLING It's not just that I don't want to. It's, it's that I am not. 

00:16:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:16:25
MOLLY STERLING Ah, but, but that's more there, that, that edge than anything else. 

00:16:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. Somehow you're not doing what you would have expected. 

00:16:40
[sil.] 

00:16:40
MOLLY STERLING Um, not sure. But that takes over and that I have to now figure out whether I agree with you or not. 

00:16:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Hmm. 

00:16:55
MOLLY STERLING Just get, I mean, I have to jump into your camp and I, it takes me out, I leave mine. 

00:17:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:17:05
MOLLY STERLING To satisfy, you know? 

00:17:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Right on foot(sp)there. Um-hmm. 

00:17:15
MOLLY STERLING That feels very familiar. 

00:17:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Hmm. And if you don't try to do anything with it what do you do with it? 

00:17:25
MOLLY STERLING Well, saying it's familiar, I settle down. 

00:17:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:17:30
[sil.] 

00:17:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL And then? 

00:17:40
MOLLY STERLING Then I went out there with the cameras and everybody and. . . 

00:17:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:17:45
MOLLY STERLING So that's another, isn't it? 

00:17:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yup. You got it. Right. 

00:17:55
MOLLY STERLING Ah. It's hopeless. I mean not hopeless-- 

00:17:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL How, how much we scurry around like that, yeah. 

00:18:00
MOLLY STERLING Um-huh. Yeah. 

00:18:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah. 

00:18:00
MOLLY STERLING Ah, if it's not one pull, it's another. 

00:18:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL But let me, let me highlight those and you just let yourself do. . . 

00:18:15
MOLLY STERLING You'll do the double checking? 

00:18:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I'll, I'll do the double checking. 

00:18:20
UNKNOWN We can't hear. 

00:18:20
UNKNOWN We can't hear anything. 

00:18:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Is-- 

00:18:25
UNKNOWN We can't understand (crosstalk inaudible ) 

00:18:28
MOLLY STERLING Can't understand? 

00:18:28
UNKNOWN (crosstalk inaudible 

00:18:30
UNKNOWN It's very muddy. 

00:18:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Is there anything to be done to get more volume? Hmm? 

00:18:40
UNKNOWN They're trying, they're trying to adjust it. 

00:18:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL They're trying to adjust it now. 

00:18:45
UNKNOWN Hold the mic. 

00:18:45
MOLLY STERLING Hold the mic? 

00:18:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:18:50
MOLLY STERLING We can do that. 

00:18:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah. 

00:18:50
MOLLY STERLING Do you want to, too? 

00:18:55
[sil.] 

00:18:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL We've never tried to do this kind of work in front of such a large audience and some, such bright lights and cameras so this is new for us too. 

00:19:10
MOLLY STERLING Much better? Okay. Back in, ha, ha, ha. 

00:19:20
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:19:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Take your time. 

00:19:25
MOLLY STERLING I, part of me is tracking doubly on this-- 

00:19:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I'll bet. 

00:19:30
MOLLY STERLING And thinking of this must seem so slow to everyone outside and yet, ah, to find words for my inside, you know, is not, it takes this kind of speed. But I, but as I do it, I'm also thinking what does this look like. 

00:19:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:19:50
MOLLY STERLING Um, and, of course, what, when it's my turn to do, to say what does this look like? What's, there's double tracking going on all the time. 

00:20:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL All the time, yeah. 

00:20:00
MOLLY STERLING Um-hmm. 

00:20:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I wouldn't fight it. Just let it double track. 

00:20:05
MOLLY STERLING Um-hmm. 

00:20:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL And, and be open to whatever comes with that. 

00:20:10
MOLLY STERLING The double tracking too? 

00:20:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:20:10
MOLLY STERLING Okay. 

00:20:15
[sil.] 

00:20:20
MOLLY STERLING Well, actually, what that leads to is how much I'll censor, you know? I am censoring the double track. 

00:20:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:20:25
MOLLY STERLING If at first look. 

00:20:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. And then? 

00:20:35
MOLLY STERLING That's more, um, if I, if I do it out loud now I will be no longer addressing you or staying entirely in me. It feels like I'm addressing out. 

00:20:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Hmm. Hmm. 

00:20:55
MOLLY STERLING And, and then that it's, it's, um, again, I'm enjoying to stay in me with you and that's secondary but so I censored. 

00:21:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. And good. Just it be you now. 

00:21:20
[sil.] 

00:21:25
MOLLY STERLING Getting drier in the, my mouth and, and, ah, it's the blank and I'm very conscious of, of being watched. 

00:21:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:21:50
MOLLY STERLING It's hard to let go of. 

00:21:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL It is. Yeah. Me too. 

00:21:55
MOLLY STERLING You too? 

00:21:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:22:00
MOLLY STERLING Hard, hard to become alone under, under the eyes, hum? 

00:22:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I didn't hear what you said. 

00:22:10
MOLLY STERLING I said, it's hard for me to become alone under this many, ah, ah, probably under any eyes but certainly under this many eyes. 

00:22:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hum. I was wondering about that dryness in the mouth. If you just stay with that for a minute what, what do you experience? What do you find coming forward? 

00:22:30
[sil.] 

00:22:35
MOLLY STERLING Ah, so, so much of what I'm trying to do has to do with getting out, getting it translated from nothing to something. And, and right now, under this much pressure, you know, every word counts. I don't think it had, I'd do this if I were by myself-- 

00:22:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:22:50
MOLLY STERLING Or with you alone, ah, but if it, there's, um, a, a kind of effort that goes on between emptiness out, ah, can I say that, out of me, ah, in, into a form. 

00:23:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Is that familiar in any way? 

00:23:25
MOLLY STERLING Oh, yes. Um-hmm. 

00:23:30
UM-HMM. THAT BRINGS A SMILE OF RECOGNITION. 

00:23:30
MOLLY STERLING Um-hmm. I mean, principally if, if I have to think on my feet, you know, if I have to, if I have to translate an idea into a, a conversation, a fast conversation-- 

00:23:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:23:50
UNKNOWN How, how difficult that is to, to find, ah, words that get the whole idea out fast enough, you know? 

00:24:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:24:05
MOLLY STERLING It has a lot to do with why I get afraid but I actually the fear that was there earlier isn't here now. It's all in my, it's all dry here. 

00:24:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. And then? Just what comes. 

00:24:20
[sil.] 

00:24:20
MOLLY STERLING Well, that felt like a relief. 

00:24:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:24:25
MOLLY STERLING Um-hmm. 

00:24:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL That monitor's still checking all the time. 

00:24:30
MOLLY STERLING Um-hmm. 

00:24:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah. I've got some of that too, yeah. 

00:24:40
MOLLY STERLING Yes, it is. It's, it's like, ah, how to let go of being watched. 

00:24:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:24:50
MOLLY STERLING Being watched over. Having to perform; having to be, do it right. 

00:24:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Your voice is getting scratchy. 

00:25:00
MOLLY STERLING Um-hmm. It, that, ah, have, it's ever-present, always watching because I'm being watched. 

00:25:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:25:20
MOLLY STERLING That came out fast. 

00:25:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yes, yeah. And then that brought with it what? 

00:25:25
MOLLY STERLING Another relief. 

00:25:30
[sil.] 

00:25:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL And? 

00:25:40
MOLLY STERLING Well, primarily it feels like it's a good time to stop. Ah. . . 

00:25:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Fine. 

00:25:50
MOLLY STERLING As, at, and to, to process it on that other level which, you know, I, I realize that to turn and say what's happening here is, is the practice of what's happening here. 

00:26:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:26:10
MOLLY STERLING And, ah, and that I'm more ready to do that. 

00:26:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Want to do that now? 

00:26:25
MOLLY STERLING Sure! 

00:26:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Okay. Trying to lift something out of a totally different context and bring it here is almost as bad as what we just did in our program, isn't it? I've tried to illustrate, as I worked with Molly just now, several things. One, my conviction that if I can help the person I'm with to really be with him, herself and operate from within, I don't need to know where they need to, to go. The direction of their work really merge. Now, in our very short and, and much-troubled effort here, perhaps you sensed still that this whole thing of being observed becomes an enactment, as Molly well pointed out, of something much broader than just now. Our time and the circumstances don't permit us to go into that very far. This is not an appropriate place. But even in, in that degree, we begin to find where the tread of concern might lead us much further. Any comment you want to make on that, Molly? 

00:27:55
MOLLY STERLING Well, I, yes. Ah, normally what I'm speaking about in this small encounter is something that can devastate me and probably what's most obvious to me is that I won't allow myself to be devastated under these conditions. Ah, I can feel that, you know? And that, and when I mention there's that edge of tears that, that it was very clear to me that I'm, I'm having no trouble this time not crying. Ah, but, when, when I work this closely as a therapist or when Jim and I work like this in supervision, it can be very quickly a, an avenue into an, um, opening of the felt level of what I was saying that doesn't exactly show this time. 

00:29:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL No. 

00:29:05
MOLLY STERLING No? Ah, and I think that's the, that's what got stopped here under these conditions. 

00:29:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:29:20
[sil.] 

00:29:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL When the work in a, with a sophisticated class, one who is familiar with this way of working , goes on within the privacy of the one-on-one relationship, and goes on with some frequency, the, the little, ah, sample that we saw gets a chance to be an entering point for an inner searching process in which associations of various kinds, sometimes surprising associations, make come to the surface. But they're meant, a number of conditions that have to be present for that kind of thing to occur. I want to just mention some of those quickly. We need a solid alliance, first of all. We need a context that supports self-exploration with a sense of of security or privacy, which manifestly we didn't have. And, usually out of those things, comes an immersion of the client; the client deeply involved in this inner work of exploration which, frankly, both of us found hard to do under lights and with the cameras and with so many faces watching us. Ah, and then an expectation of discovery. This often turns out to be one of the more difficult things to help clients get to. The initial expectation is that they'll tell the doctor what the problem is and then the doctor will work out what the solution is to be. And gradually I have to help the client develop that expectation of discovery, that they will discover by looking within, not outside. Ah, I think I'd like to work with one of the other people now. 

00:31:35
MOLLY STERLING All right(sp). Andrea, do you want to come up? 

00:31:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Thank you. I'm going to now switch a little bit by working with someone I'm not familiar with. Ah, it'd be a different phase of the work but will also illustrate something about trying to work close. Andrea, thank you for coming. 

00:31:55
ANDREA Oh, thank you for having me here. 

00:31:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL It looks like we have to hold these things. Do you mind? 

00:32:00
ANDREA Okay. 

00:32:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Okay? 

00:32:00
ANDREA Um-hmm. 

00:32:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Do you want to take a minute and just, ah, get used to being up here as much as one can get used to being up here? 

00:32:10
ANDREA Well, I'm going to stay in a place of trust that, um, what serves me well here serves everyone here so that. . . 

00:32:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Fine. 

00:32:20
ANDREA It's okay. 

00:32:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL What I'd like you to do then is to think of some issue, not the number one or even the number two issue, but some genuine issue in your life that we could work to, on together and explore a little bit together now. Could you think of that? 

00:32:35
ANDREA Ah, surely. I suggested the possibility that I, I've been in practice now for ten or more years and, ah, I'm living in a part of the country that is close to home and, um, I have a sense of completion in the work that I've done. 

00:32:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:32:50
ANDREA Either in the method I'm using or the community I'm working in, and I very much have this deep sense of completion but I'm unclear about where to go. 

00:33:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:33:05
ANDREA That's part of why I'm here at this conference is to-- 

00:33:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Good enough, yeah. 

00:33:05
ANDREA Look around. 

00:33:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. And I, I can hear it in here. 

00:33:10
ANDREA Yeah. 

00:33:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Those darned things get to us, don't they, those lights and everything? 

00:33:15
ANDREA Um-hmm. 

00:33:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah, sure. Okay, let that be and just see what comes next. You've told me now what the issue is. Um, where are you as you reflect on it right now? 

00:33:30
ANDREA Well, in fact, I'm, I'm experiencing some excitement-- 

00:33:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:33:35
ANDREA About making your acquaintance, finding myself here. 

00:33:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:33:35
ANDREA Ah, and discovering that there are a number of people who were working in ways different from the classical training that I had. 

00:33:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:33:45
ANDREA Which might expand, ah, what's possible for me. 

00:33:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:33:50
ANDREA So, in my body I'm experiencing, um, a sense of movement, not in any particular organ system, but just a general sense of movement. 

00:34:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-huh. That's the, the excitement is, is kind of a general, physical thing? 

00:34:05
ANDREA Yeah, it's kind of in, in, and it tends to be tends to be in this solar plexus-- 

00:34:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Particularly in here. Yeah. 

00:34:10
ANDREA Heart area. 

00:34:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL There ya go. Okay. 

00:34:10
ANDREA Yeah. 

00:34:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Can you let yourself just kind of listen there and be open to whatever may emerge in your awareness? Just whatever's there. Hmm. Your face changes. 

00:34:30
[sil.] 

00:34:30
ANDREA Well, what's coming up is, ah, a mixture of joy and sadness, both. 

00:34:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL They're both there. 

00:34:45
ANDREA Ah, I have a sense of, ah, both dreams fulfilled and dreams that are, um, that I'm wary, I'm wary of my own dream-making-- 

00:34:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Hmm. 

00:35:00
ANDREA Because, having fulfilled a set of dreams and experienced, um, ah, how one can never really anticipate what's going to show up even-- 

00:35:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:35:10
ANDREA You know, that there, ah, there've been wonderful parts of fulfilling these dreams and there have been lots of disappointments, too. That, you know, why bother? This sort of existential thing of why bother to create some new dreams? 

00:35:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:35:25
ANDREA They'll only be more mixed blessings, and that's a kind of sadness that, ah, is attached to family ways of thinking. 

00:35:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:35:35
ANDREA And, um-- 

00:35:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL As you got into that your body got restless. Could you feel it? 

00:35:40
ANDREA Got what? 

00:35:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Your body got kind of restless. Your feet moved. 

00:35:40
ANDREA Yeah, feet, they're moving, yeah. 

00:35:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-huh. 

00:35:45
ANDREA Yeah, that's, that's the, um, that's a form of thinking that has been passed down through generations, which doesn't serve me very well, and it's still there. 

00:35:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Hmm. 

00:35:55
ANDREA Ah, the part of me that is excited and hopeful, um, isn't moving around in the periphery. It's much more in the center. 

00:36:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Ah. Um-hum. Um-huh. The, the foot part that's been passed down is in the periphery but the excitement and the hope is in the center? 

00:36:15
ANDREA Yes, that's correct. 

00:36:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Can you let both of 'em into you at once? Kind of let 'em bump together, or whatever they do, and see what comes? 

00:36:25
[sil.] 

00:36:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Yeah. 

00:36:40
ANDREA Well, the words for it, I suppose, are that I am. Um, as I am more and more, ah, an individualized being, um, possibilities of new experiences are emerging. 

00:36:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. 

00:36:55
ANDREA And that feels, that fee's real warm up here. 

00:37:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Right in there. Yeah. Um-hmm. And your voice got very soft as you said that, yeah. And a big smile. Can you just go with it now? See where it takes you. It's warm, makes you feel good here and you smile. Your breathing changes. Hmm. 

00:37:25
ANDREA Well, I wonder if it's possible to stay in this state of, um, optimism for any extended period of time. 

00:37:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. So there's a little doubt that begins to creep in the corners, huh? 

00:37:40
ANDREA Yeah, it keeps coming, yeah. 

00:37:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. And you have kind of a wry laugh when you see that. 

00:37:50
ANDREA Um-hmm. 

00:37:50
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL What does that bring? 

00:37:50
ANDREA The wry laugh? 

00:37:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-huh. And seeing that little doubt creep in there. 

00:38:00
[sil.] 

00:38:00
ANDREA Yeah. The image that shows up is, um, of a real stretched thin, almost transparent umbilicus. 

00:38:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:38:15
ANDREA You know, this is still an attachment too. 

00:38:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Still attached. Yeah. 

00:38:20
ANDREA Um. . . 

00:38:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL But very thin, very stretched. 

00:38:20
ANDREA Skin, yeah. 

00:38:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-huh. And that brings-- 

00:38:25
ANDREA Yeah, there's a little shaking through the whole thing. 

00:38:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I see that, yeah. Okay, you're on a good thread. See if you can just let that lead you where it goes next. You're doing it. And again, your face changes. 

00:38:45
[sil.] 

00:38:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL What's there now? 

00:39:00
ANDREA Honestly, was an image of myself, um, aged more, um, and kind of a glimpse of a sense of, um, of the wry laugh that I might have 10, 15, 20 years from now as I look back at this particular stage of my life. 

00:39:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Hmm. Hmm. 

00:39:25
ANDREA And, and at the wisdom that, um, it's just waiting, you know, for me to have the experience to acquire. 

00:39:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. Hmm. That's interesting to look at yourself from some time in the future that way. 

00:39:40
ANDREA Well, I was kind of looking through your eyes for a moment. 

00:39:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Ah! Um-hmm. 

00:39:40
ANDREA At least I used you for that purpose. 

00:39:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I'm sorry? 

00:39:45
ANDREA I used you for that purpose. 

00:39:45
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-huh. Um-huh. Can you do that some more and see what else comes? Hmm? 

00:39:55
ANDREA Ah. . . 

00:39:55
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL That brings a lot of movement, doesn't it? 

00:39:55
ANDREA Yeah. 

00:40:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-huh. What's that like inside? 

00:40:05
[sil.] 

00:40:05
ANDREA I'm, I'm feeling, um, more light and, ah, although my muscles are quivering all over, um-- 

00:40:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Are they? 

00:40:25
ANDREA Yeah. 

00:40:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-huh. But-- 

00:40:30
ANDREA Ah, I am feeling, um, I'm, I'm in touch with this sense of confidence about my own-- 

00:40:35
ANDREA Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:40:35
ANDREA Capacity for harmony. 

00:40:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Once again, you've made a distinction between one part of you and another. Once it was the periphery and one the core and this time your muscles and I. 

00:40:50
ANDREA Yeah. Well the muscles, if I were to stay in the place of my muscles all I would make would be little ha, ha, ha, ha sounds. 

00:41:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Ah! 

00:41:00
ANDREA They're only little, little vibratory sounds because they're all quivering around small muscles groups or. 

00:41:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. And clearly you don't want to go that way? 

00:41:10
ANDREA Well, it wouldn't be nearly so graceful as I'd like to see myself. 

00:41:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL I see. Okay. We won't push you that way then. 

00:41:20
ANDREA Thank you. I could take a lesson from Doctor Lowen(sp)and start screaming, no! 

00:41:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Right. Right. 

00:41:25
ANDREA That would-- 

00:41:30
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-huh. Is this a good place for us to stop, you think? 

00:41:30
ANDREA Sure. It's fine. 

00:41:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Would you do something for a minute, Andrea? Just kind of reflect out loud, if you can, on what we've been doing and whatever it brings into your thoughts? How we've done it or what it suggests to you. Anything you'd like. 

00:41:50
ANDREA Um, ah, the part, let's see, what have I been observing of the experience? I've observed your drawing my attention to disparities between, ah, what you're seeing in my body or my descriptions of my body and the immediate experience, and my report of what's going on in my mind or my self-image. 

00:42:10
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:42:10
ANDREA And, ah. . . 

00:42:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Was there any impact you noticed out of drawing your attention to that? 

00:42:20
ANDREA Yes, and, oh, a, a sense of opening and deepening of the experience. 

00:42:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:42:25
ANDREA And feeling very, remarkably safe. 

00:42:25
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Okay. 

00:42:30
ANDREA Yeah. So, ah, yes, a sense of, um, mirroring, not in a sense of being mimicked but of being directed-- 

00:42:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. Um-hmm. 

00:42:35
ANDREA In a gentle way. 

00:42:40
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Um-hmm. How is it in your body now after we've stopped, sort of, and you can adjust? 

00:42:50
ANDREA Well, ah, things are settling down. There's still a quivering, um, oh, but I, I feel much more quiet and at ease. 

00:43:00
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Very good. 

00:43:05
ANDREA Thank you. 

00:43:05
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Thank you so much. Can we thank her? 

00:43:10
[sil.] 

00:43:20
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL How are we? How are we on time? Ten minutes? 

00:43:25
[sil.] 

00:43:35
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL The core of what I'm trying to demonstrate is my belief that within each of us, client and therapist alike, are much greater depth, depths of experiencing, of awareness, of potential than our ordinary, commonplace experience allows any space for, any opportunity for it to come forward and to, to flourish. And that my task is that of clearing the way. And I can clear the way in by doing several different kinds of things. First, to try to help the client be as present as possible, as here, now. Thus, I will watch if the client starts to distance herself or himself. It's to talk about, um, oneself in the second or the third person. Ah, I will watch if their divisions, as Andrea noted that I was doing with her; diving herself up one way or another. Um, the second kind of thing I can do is to call attention to the, ah, expression of the preconscious, ah, of the implicit, of that which is not yet available to verbalization but which is demonstrated to the, through the non-verbal things, through the breathing, facial expressions, body movement, ah, all of these things. Those are very important parts of the communication but are often unnoticed by the person who is, who is exhibiting them because their attention is on the specific and explicit content. By then bringing the implicit in, it gives a, a further boost to that inner-ness, gives additional energy to it. A third way of trying to foster this process is to show my own response from time to time, selectively. To be self-disclosing when it can support where the client is or where the client is moving. Thus, with Molly, I shared the feeling that I was very aware of all the lights and people and, ah, cameras and all that sort of thing. Ah, by sharing in it that way, but I would not want to share something, at this stage of the work at least, that was at quite a sharp contrast because that would then pull the person out of being deeper in herself, himself as they came up to, to deal with me. Now Molly, you may remember, was recognizing how she was thinking about me when she was trying to get into herself. And that's part of thinking about herself, or exploring within, but I've gotta be aware of how much am I getting in the way in some way? I want to try to put this up so I can use my hands for a minute. The model that I have in mind, now, all right? Good. Is that I, ah, still not? All right, I'll try to project a little more. There? Okay. The model is that I need to keep a gentle but consistent press; an easing off as things flow well but then coming back with it. But as I do so I also try to find ways of support: you're doing well, you're on the track. See if you can go with what you've just discovered, that blankness. But combining press with support. Now, with some people, where I'm concerned a bit about the ego functioning, the ability to maintain structure sufficiently for the work, I would add another back stop, so to speak, so I don't push over the edge metaphorically, and that is you're doing very well and this is hard to do but you're doing it, and I'm gonna be right here with you as you do it. Do you see? It's, it gives a, um, a sense of containment or security in doing that. Um, also I'm very concerned in doing this to explore the client's attitude toward their own, his her own productions. That is, how they feel about how they're doing right now as we work. Often, this opens up a lot more. At any one moment, and you know this, we have that which is in the forefront of our awareness and then we have our commentary on it, which is back of that. But if I can get that commentary to come forward two things are, they're two values to that. As the commentary comes forward, and it is expressed, we get a little deepening of the work but we also bring new commentary in back of that. It's an endless series, of course, but as that series is given space and encouragement to come out, the person doing this finds his, her own feelings deepening and coming, ah, coming more and more to the fore. 

00:49:10
[sil.] 

00:49:15
DR. JAMES BUGENTAL Kind, kind of summarizing it, the big thing that I'm trying to attend to is how is the client using the opportunity that is the psychotherapy? Is the client using this opportunity to deepen self-understanding, self-awareness? Is the client using this to, to confess his, her sins and get absolution? Is the client using this, ah, to fill me in on details of her, his life as though I were a biographer? Ah, and is the client trying to, um, win my approval, my applaudants(sp) or is the client trying to anger me into, to get me to pull away at a distance? What is the use being made of this opportunity? You see, that gives me, yesterday some of you who were with me may, may remember I spoke of the Pousto, the place to stand, P, P-O-U-S-T-O. Ah, if I have the sense this is a person in the midst of her own life trying to have more of the life she wants, using me as a, a resource to have more of the life she wants, but knowing that basically I'm in the same boat that she is. Not a superhuman; not all-knowing or all-powerful, but using me as a resource in a realistic way, and if I have the view that my job is to be with this person in this pursuit, to help them use their own capacities more fully, more effectively, to help them discover the ways in which they do not use those capacities well, then we have, ah, a realistic conception of each of our positions, our, our pousto's, our places to stand. Thank you. But also embedded in that way of thinking about it is a way of thinking about the transference and the counter-transference. If my client begins to make me the absolving priest, the punishing parent, or something, that's not who I am. That's not, that's a distortion of what's going on. If I tried to be the good father or the, the furious policeman or whatever I'm not in my position. That's my counter-transference. But, of course, we always do that. The client always tries to make me something other than who I am and I always fall into it in some major and some degree. Edgar Levenson(sp) talks about three phase, phases of the development of the depth therapy, or analytic relationship. The first was the blank screen in which anything that the patient said was obviously a projection 'cuz the therapist was a blank. Well, no therapist is a blank. Ever see a picture of Freud's consulting room? Loaded with his trophies and his family photographs and so on. Those who were analyzed by Freud tell us that he was positively garrulous about his family concerns. Not a blank screen by any means. But then next comes Harry Stack Sullivan, who talks about the participant observer, recognizing that I, being here with the client, am a participant and that I need to observe what is the impact of my presence? But that's still a kind of detached ob, observational position. And then third, and he says this is where we are now, is the transference, counter-transference entanglement. That when we work together depth, in depth over a lengths of time, inevitably we bring our own stuff to it and get away from our real pousto's, our, our true identities, and that's great if we recognize it, if we expose it, if we work it through. It's destructive if we just stay caught in it and act it out but it's the position of greatest power if I say to Frank, who some of you may know in one of my books, who's always aggravating, always oppositional, and Frank says, ah, oh, you, you guys. You don't give a damn about patients anyway. You just wanna get my money. You don't care what I, how my life goes. And I said, Frank, I'm sick and tired of your crap. You're always doing it and we yah, yah, yah each other, and then we stop and we say wait a minute, wait a minute. What are we doing? And I say, you know, you really touched something in me that, that had to strike back. And he said, well, I wasn't you. I just feel so lousy all the time and we begin to look at how we got into that thing and all the various forms that the, the collusion can take. I found a useful sentence or a question to ask myself when I want to try to get in touch with that collusion and that's what do I hesitate to say to this patient? Uh-oh, I don't wanna know the answer to that one, but it's a useful question. What I hesitate to say reveals where we are colluding not to be in our pousto's, not to be in our real position. It can be as simple as you never talk to me about your life as if I'm a real person. It's I'm always some, like, part of the furniture. It can be as, as uncomfortable as saying to one client I remember I wish you'd take a bath before you come in. Ah, that was so hard to say, but, ah, after that patient left the room the office stank for an hour and a half at least. Incidentally, when I did, and it was kind of, it as a good opening to our work, but it turned out that that patient was so anxious that though she, ah, might have showered just before-hand, she would sweat so much in the waiting room and in the hour that that's why this, this stink was so much. But that was important for us to get to, to get it out and for me to express my discomfort with her. It didn't help the stink a lot, I must say. If I can face what it is I hesitate to say I being to see how we're colluding, and that brings us back to this engagement, where sometimes it's my job to disclose my own counter-transference, my own distortion of our relation, and marvel that this can be done and that we can grow out of it, not loose our dignity or our power by doing so. Well, I've enjoyed trying to present this. It's been a new and somewhat formidable experience. Oh, thank you. Stand up, would you, please? Michael, isn't it? Michael here will take business cards or names and addresses of anybody who might like to be on my mailing list and he's gonna be right over here. Thank you for coming!
