SANDY WILLIAMS Okay, Ben. So we've got the formalities out of the way. We've talked about confidentiality. We've talked about, ah, the hours of the clinic, etcetera. 

00:00:20
BEN Uh-huh. 

00:00:20
SANDY WILLIAMS So, uhm, how come you're sitting here in this office talking to me. It's two o'clock on a Tuesday afternoon. You should be out having a cappuccino with mates and yet you're here. Uhm, something has cropped up that you feel you'd like to talk about? 

00:00:35
BEN Ah, well, I, I got, ah, referred to, ah, this place. 

00:00:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Uh-huh. 

00:00:45
BEN And, uhm, my girlfriend sort of pressured me to come. 

00:00:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So she put the hard word on you, aye? 

00:00:50
BEN Yeah. 

00:00:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. So she's worried about something? 

00:00:55
BEN Ah, yeah, I guess, I guess she's worried. She worries a little bit. She worries too much anyway. She's worried about my drinking. Like . . . 

00:01:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:01:05
BEN Yeah. 

00:01:05
SANDY WILLIAMS So, you obviously drink, and you drink in her eyes, you're drinking a bit more than is wise?

00:01:15
Assessment 

00:01:15
"I don't think I drink too much" 

00:01:20
SANDY WILLIAMS So, I mean, she didn't kind of wheel you here and dump you at the front gate. You've, you've walked through the, the front gate. You've, you've got some concerns yourself or something you'd like to . . . 

00:01:30
BEN Aye, you know, not, not really. Uhm, mainly just cuz, you know, she's been a bit, yeah. 

00:01:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:01:40
BEN Having a go at me and I just figured . . . 

00:01:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. And she's obviously important to you? 

00:01:40
BEN Yeah. 

00:01:40
SANDY WILLIAMS And if it's mattering to her, then it's kind of mattering to you? 

00:01:45
BEN Yeah. I figured I'd, you know, might as well give it a shot. 

00:01:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:01:50
BEN Yeah. 

00:01:50
SANDY WILLIAMS All right. Well, good for you. Uhm, so you've--it would help me to get a bit of a picture about what's going on with your, with your drinking so we can decide together whether there's something to be worried about or whether you want to do something about it. So is it okay if we get a bit of detail? 

00:02:10
BEN Sure. 

00:02:10
SANDY WILLIAMS All right. 

00:02:10
BEN Yeah. 

00:02:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:02:10
BEN I mean, I don't really think that I drink very much. 

00:02:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:02:15
BEN I, I don't drink any more than, you know, any of my other mates. So . . . 

00:02:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:02:20
BEN . . . so we, we don't . . . 

00:02:20
SANDY WILLIAMS So in your view it's, it's pretty, kind of standard, pretty normal. 

00:02:25
BEN Yeah. 

00:02:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. But in her view, there's something that's kind of concerning her. Is there--has there been anything that's happened recently that would have got her to be more worried than, than normal? 

00:02:35
BEN Ah, I went out like a couple of weeks ago and I got a little bit, you know, a bit boozy and I maybe got into a little bit of a fight with some guy. But it wasn't, you know, it wasn't my fault. 

00:02:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. Okay. So something happened and you were provoked and you had a bit of a banny (ph) with somebody. 

00:02:55
BEN Yeah,. 

00:02:55
SANDY WILLIAMS And . . . 

00:02:55
BEN . . . like it wasn't that bad. We didn't get like, you know, the cops but I, I just don't know, I did, I got a couple of, ah, broken ribs in that, you know. So I had to go to the hospital but it wasn't anything. 

00:03:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So you actually had to go and get attended to? 

00:03:10
BEN Yeah. Well, it--we just went to, ah, the emergency . . . 

00:03:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:03:10
BEN . . . area and just sat. They made us sit for a week. 

00:03:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Ribs, ribs are not good, are they? 

00:03:15
BEN Yeah, you can't actually--they just really made sure that they were all right and then sent us on home. I was feeling a little bit worse for wear. 

00:03:25
SANDY WILLIAMS And your girlfriend probably got a bit of mileage out of that one, aye? 

00:03:25
BEN Yeah. 

00:03:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Yeah. 

00:03:25
BEN Yeah. 

00:03:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So, uhm, in, in any given week, uhm, let's try to get a bit of a picture about, uhm, what you drink, how much you drink. 

00:03:40
BEN Yeah, you know, after work we'll always have a couple and at night, you know. You always, you always, like you generally, you'll have like a beer with dinner or something like that or . . . 

00:03:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Yeah. 

00:03:50
BEN You know. 

00:03:50
SANDY WILLIAMS And then when--on what occasions would you drink a bit more? 

00:04:00

00:04:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:04:35
BEN Ah, some nights obviously, you know, like at my local, we have sort of a jug night on Wednesdays but apart from that . . . 

00:04:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So there's a bit of a smorgasbord in terms of, of the kind of containers and the . . . 

00:04:50
BEN Yeah. 

00:04:50
SANDY WILLIAMS . . . kind of beer that you might have and . . . 

00:04:55
BEN It's, it's all, it's all beer. 

00:04:55
SANDY WILLIAMS How much would you drink you know, in a heavy duty sitting. You know, like what, what would be the, the most and, and what would be the norm? Have you got, got a handle on that? 

00:05:05
BEN Ah, probably like--say like if we went out like on a Friday night? Is it? 

00:05:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Uh-huh. 

00:05:10
BEN Yeah. Uhm . . . 

00:05:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Which would be what? A, a couple of drinks before you leave home and then . . . 

00:05:20
BEN Yeah, we'll, we'll have a couple. 

00:05:20
SANDY WILLIAMS . . . a pub and then a going to club or what? 

00:05:20
BEN Friday, you'll have a couple of drinks after work so you go to the pub, maybe have like one or two. Ah, or three. Or four, yeah. And then say you have a few there and then you go, you go home and you usually go to a mate's place for pre-drinks and then from there, you go to the pub and then wherever the night takes you, I guess. 

00:05:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. 

00:05:45
BEN Yeah. 

00:05:45
SANDY WILLIAMS So it's kind of continuous from about what? You knock off about, what, what, what do you do, Ben? Like what, what sort of work do you do? 

00:05:50
BEN I do contract work for the pastoring. 

00:05:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:05:55
BEN Yeah. 

00:05:55

00:06:00
BEN Yeah. 

00:06:00
SANDY WILLIAMS That's where your apprenticeship, did your, did your time? Yeah, good for you. 

00:06:00
BEN Yeah, it's great. It's just a, it's a good job, outside. 

00:06:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:06:05
BEN And so I, yeah. 

00:06:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Yeah. 

00:06:10
BEN Good variety. 

00:06:10
SANDY WILLIAMS And so when you knock off on a, on a Friday, you knock off about what, four, four-thirty, on a Friday? 

00:06:15
BEN It depends. Sometimes if it's raining, we don't work at all if we have an outside job. 

00:06:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. 

00:06:20
BEN But, ah, yeah. Ah, generally, yeah five, five or four. 

00:06:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:06:30
BEN Four-thirty. 

00:06:30
SANDY WILLIAMS So from about the--from then until you kind of hit the sack whenever in the wee small hours of Saturday, there'd be fairly continuous kind of socializing and, and having some drinks. 

00:06:40
BEN Yep. 

00:06:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Have you got a, I mean I don't know if you're familiar with the, with the notion of a standard drink, you know, but have you got an idea about how much you put away in a--on a Friday or a Saturday night? 

00:06:55
BEN I don't know. Uhm, a fair bit. 

00:07:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:07:00
BEN For a little guy, I can put it away. 

00:07:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. Yeah. 

00:07:05
BEN Ah, yeah, cuz, you know, oh! 

00:07:10
SANDY WILLIAMS If you--so if you're drinking pints . . . 

00:07:15
BEN So like a night of drin--like if we're staying at one place . . . 

00:07:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Uh-huh. 

00:07:15
BEN . . . and I'm, you know, drinking there. Uhm, probably like in a normal night, prob--oh, might have like--on a big night, you'll have like maybe, if you've had--about nine or 10 . . . 

00:07:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Uh-huh. 

00:07:35
BEN . . . or so. 

00:07:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Yeah. 

00:07:35
BEN That's pretty good effort. 

00:07:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. And what, what are you like by the time you, you've knocked off your 10, ninth or your tenth You have a notion about it? 

00:07:45
BEN Ah, pretty smashed, yeah. 

00:07:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Okay. So you have a good time. 

00:07:50
BEN From what I can remember, yeah. 

00:07:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Okay. So you get quite affected? So what gets you to stop? I mean, how do you, how do you know when to knock off? 

00:08:00
BEN Before I pass out. 

00:08:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. 

00:08:05
BEN Yeah. 

00:08:05
SANDY WILLIAMS That's, that's pretty duty, isn't it, to get to that point? 

00:08:05
BEN Well, you know, I'll make it home. 

00:08:10
SANDY WILLIAMS You make it home? 

00:08:10
BEN Yeah. 

00:08:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:08:10
BEN Most of the time. 

00:08:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Uhm, and your girlfriend, what's, what's her name? 

00:08:20
BEN Sky. 

00:08:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So Sky has generally not, not been too fussed about this until you had the, the rib incident? 

00:08:30
BEN Yeah, I mean, up until then, she's given me a little bit--she's sort of, I don't know, grown in, ah, you know, disapproval. 

00:08:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So she's, she's been getting more concerned? 

00:08:45
BEN Yeah. 

00:08:45
SANDY WILLIAMS What, what is it that she doesn't like about what's happening? 

00:08:50
BEN Ah, I guess she--it's like she says that it's a health issue, and it's a, it's like a couple of things, I guess. And she doesn't--I don't know, sometimes, ah, I guess she doesn't really like it when I'm that drunk, when I'm drunk. 

00:09:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So she's kind of worried that maybe you're doing your--some harm to yourself somehow? 

00:09:10
BEN Yeah, I guess so, yeah. 

00:09:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:09:10
BEN Yeah. 

00:09:10
SANDY WILLIAMS So Ben, give me a bit of an idea about Friday and Saturday night, which are sort of the bigger nights but I think you, you just alluded earlier to the fact that, you know, there is some drinking happening Thursday, Wednesday. It's creeping up a bit? 

00:09:25
BEN Oh, yeah. Sometimes, ah, sometimes Wednesdays you'll go out, or, or, stay in or just have, have, you know, just drinks and . . . 

00:09:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:09:35
BEN . . . and you'll just--I, I quite like just to sit in front of the, you know, telly and veg out sometimes . . . 

00:09:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:09:40
BEN . . . and just-- you obviously, yeah, I just, I just drink sometimes. 

00:09:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. And is your girlfriend a bit kind of pissed off about that as well or is more the heavy nights that she's worried about? 

00:09:55
BEN I don't--I, I guess it's the heavy nights that she's worried about. I really don't have a problem with . . . 

00:09:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:10:00
BEN . . . those big nights, like those Wednesdays and other nights. 

00:10:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Uh-huh. 

00:10:05
BEN Unless, you know, we go out, which we do sometimes. 

00:10:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:10:10
BEN But, uhm, sometimes, you know, when I'm just drinking, I'm by myself or with her, we're watching the telly, telly, I don't really see any problem with that and she . . . yeah. 

00:10:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:10:20
BEN It's not like I'm, you know, I'm not obnoxious, I just get a little bit, a little bit . . . 

00:10:25
SANDY WILLIAMS A little bit crazy. 

00:10:25
BEN Yeah. 

00:10:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Uhm, let me, let me just check whether there's anything else in the picture. You know, there are other sources of pleasure that people can, uhm, indulge in, you know. Whether there's the odd bit of, uhm, weed or, uhm, speed or pill anything else? 

00:10:40
BEN Oh yeah. Yeah, I have some, sometimes weed. 

00:10:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:10:45
BEN Maybe like once every blue moon you have a little bit of speed or a pill but that's . . . 

00:10:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:10:50
BEN . . . like. I don't really do pills anymore. 

00:10:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:10:55
BEN Maybe if you go to like a big concert or something or . . . 

00:11:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:11:00
BEN Yeah. But, no, nothing like that. Uhm, sometimes you do . . . 

00:11:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Sometimes . . . 

00:11:00
BEN . . . pot but not really just because, ah, yeah, pot and booze don't really, ah, they're not great friends. 

00:11:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Okay. All right. So those things are not really a kind of, ah, an issue from your girlfriend's perspective or . . . 

00:11:20
BEN Yeah, no, I don't, I don't think it is. I mean, you know, there's . . . 

00:11:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Okay.

00:11:30
Working with ambivalence 

00:11:35
SANDY WILLIAMS So, let's, let's take a little bit of a closer look. I mean, obviously you wouldn't be drinking if, if the way that you are if it didn't, uhm, do the job in some sense, you know. 

00:11:45
BEN Hmm. 

00:11:45
SANDY WILLIAMS So what, what are the good things about drinking the way you do and drinking what you do and drinking how you do? 

00:11:55
BEN It's just fun. It's social and it tastes good and you just go out with friends and you just drink. You just go out and drink, yeah. It's just fun. 

00:12:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:12:10
BEN And you know, if you--but if, you know, you go--if you're drinking at home, then it's just nice and relaxing to have a nice, a nice beer or a wine or, you know. 

00:12:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So it's fun. It relaxes you. It's kind of, uhm, part of the group that you move with. It's kind of a given that you're going to be drinking, you know . . . 

00:12:30
BEN Yeah. 

00:12:30
SANDY WILLIAMS . . . with that crew. What would be some of the things that, that might be less good about it, that are not so flash in terms of . . . 

00:12:40
BEN Hangovers. 

00:12:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. What happens when you have a hangover? 

00:12:40
BEN Ah, bad things. 

00:12:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:12:45

00:12:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. 

00:12:50
BEN Not very nice. 

00:12:50
SANDY WILLIAMS So you have a headache. You feel pretty scrimy in the guts. You . . . 

00:12:55
BEN Yeah, not nice to go to work too. Yeah. So . . . 

00:12:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. Do, do you have to get up quite early to, to go . . . 

00:13:00
BEN Yeah. 

00:13:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Okay. So kind of crawling out at dawn to friend out for a plastering job can be a bit rough if you've got a, you've had a big night. 

00:13:10
BEN Yeah. 

00:13:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Okay. 

00:13:10
BEN Yeah, it can be. 

00:13:15
SANDY WILLIAMS What else is not so flash about it? What are you having to deal with that's not so flash? 

00:13:20
BEN Well, the fight. 

00:13:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:13:20
BEN It's not a great thing. 

00:13:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:13:25
BEN Hmm. 

00:13:25
SANDY WILLIAMS It's not kind of characteristic of you to get into a fight? 

00:13:25
BEN No, not particularly, no. 

00:13:30
SANDY WILLIAMS So you did something that was kind of out of character? 

00:13:30
BEN Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. I mean, it wasn't my fault. 

00:13:35
SANDY WILLIAMS And your girlfriend was pretty upset about that that? 

00:13:35
BEN Yeah. 

00:13:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. 

00:13:35
BEN And I guess she--yeah. That's I guess another one. She doesn't really like it. 

00:13:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So she was kind of a bit shocked that you got into a fight? 

00:13:45
BEN Yeah. 

00:13:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. 

00:13:45
BEN She wasn't happy. 

00:13:50
SANDY WILLIAMS No. Right. And, I mean, you mentioned earlier that your girlfriend's kind of a bit worried about health consequences. What, what, what, what can, what do you know about how your health could be compromised? 

00:14:05
BEN Hmm. Being it gives you a gut. 

00:14:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:14:05
BEN That's not a great thing. 

00:14:10
SANDY WILLIAMS So you wouldn't like to develop one of those paunches by the age of--how old are you Ben? 

00:14:15
BEN Twenty-four. 

00:14:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Okay. So by the time you're pushing 30, you, you could be, uhm . . . 

00:14:20
BEN Yeah. 

00:14:20
SANDY WILLIAMS . . . developing a nice paunch. 

00:14:20
BEN A nice retirement fund. 

00:14:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. Yeah. And you don't--that's not particularly attractive? 

00:14:25
BEN No, I guess, I guess not. 

00:14:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:14:30
BEN No. And, and, you know, my Dad, he drank a fair bit so . . . 

00:14:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:14:35
BEN I know that he didn't particularly have the best of health. 

00:14:35
SANDY WILLIAMS All right. Yeah. What, what else happened to him? 

00:14:40
BEN Uhm, he just had, just health problems. 

00:14:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. Gut problems? 

00:14:45
BEN Yeah, but he used to smoke as well. And got problems-- liver problems and everything. 

00:14:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Okay. But there's a kind of a, a notion that maybe the drinking that he did wasn't, wasn't good for him and, and actually had some con--some serious consequences? 

00:15:00
BEN Yeah, I mean, he did drink, ah, like, sort of harder stuff. 

00:15:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. All right. So he hit the spirits a bit, did he? 

00:15:05
BEN Yeah. 

00:15:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Hmm. So there's kind of health things. There's the fact that you got into a fight that's kind of out of character and your girlfriend wasn't too happy about that, you ended up in hospital. You ended up in pain for a few days. 

00:15:25
BEN Hmm. 

00:15:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Uhm, what--how much--we talked a bit about how mu--how, how much you drank, how much do you reckon you would spend in a given week on your girl? 

00:15:35
BEN Oh, you know that's a good question. Uhm . . . 

00:15:40
SANDY WILLIAMS It probably amounts up a bit, doesn't it? 

00:15:40
BEN Yeah. Ah, I guess if you go for like a carton-- if you buy, you know, you buy maybe like one, maybe two cartons, maybe three cartons a week and then . . . 

00:15:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Uh-huh. 

00:15:55
BEN Ah . . . 

00:15:55
SANDY WILLIAMS What do they cost? 

00:16:00
BEN About 40, 50. 

00:16:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:16:00
BEN Yeah, 50, 50 odd dollars for like--I don't know. Generally, the bottle shop near me is about $50 for a Heineken. 

00:16:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. And then the pints that you'd be buying when you're out or . . . 

00:16:15
BEN Ah . . . 

00:16:15
SANDY WILLIAMS . . . the odd spirits or . . . 

00:16:15
BEN Depends on where you go. Generally, about 8, 9, 9.50. 

00:16:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. And if you're putting away maybe 10 of those? 

00:16:25
BEN Yeah. That's a fair amount. Yeah. I guess it's a, you know, a few hundred maybe. 

00:16:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Okay. 

00:16:30
BEN Maybe three. 

00:16:30
SANDY WILLIAMS So you're paying for your pleasure, aren't you? 

00:16:35
BEN Two or three. Yeah, I guess so when you put it like that. 

00:16:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:16:35
BEN Yeah. 

00:16:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Are there other things that you and your girlfriend would, would be spending your money on if you weren't spending quite that much? 

00:16:45
BEN Yeah, I mean, Sky wants to go, she always wanted to go, she wants to go on a holiday. 

00:16:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:16:50
BEN Yeah. She just wants to go and go to Europe and whatnot. 

00:16:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Uh-huh. Right. So that money that's getting a few hundred bucks a week on, on your girl kind of mounts up? 

00:17:05
BEN Yeah, I guess so. 

00:17:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. 

00:17:05
BEN Yeah. 

00:17:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So have you talked to her? 

00:17:10
BEN Yeah, we've had, we've had a few heated arguments about it. 

00:17:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So it sounds like some of the good things about drinking the way you do are that it's pretty, pretty much the norm with the group of people that you move with. You socialize a lot. You have a good time. Yeah? 

00:17:30
BEN Uh-huh. 

00:17:30
SANDY WILLIAMS You also are a bit of a connoisseur of your beers . . . 

00:17:35
BEN I do like the beer. 

00:17:35
SANDY WILLIAMS . . . kind of like the range. Yeah. Hmm. It's, it's, it's almost unthinkable not to, not to have drink as part of your life, aye? 

00:17:45
BEN Yeah. 

00:17:45
SANDY WILLIAMS It relaxes you. You knock off work with your mates, your, your work mates. It's a kind of transition into post-work life that evening, yeah? 

00:17:50
BEN Uh-huh. 

00:17:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Uhm, but some of the things that are not so flash about it are that your girlfriend's been on your back lately cuz it seems like things have crept up a bit. You've got into a bit of strife that doesn't sound like it's part of your character, that you're pretty mild-mannered man normally and you got into a bit of a fight and you ended up in hospital with broken ribs, which are not to be stiffed at, hmm? 

00:18:15
BEN Hmm. 

00:18:15
SANDY WILLIAMS And you did allude to your Dad kind of having a bit of a, bit of a drink problem. He's got a bit of a paunch on him but he's also had some health problems. Uhm, did he really hit the bottle a bit in your family? 

00:18:30
BEN Yeah, he did a fair bit. 

00:18:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. So he wasn't a well man and he--where there other consequences for the family of, of him drinking the way he did? 

00:18:40
BEN Yeah. I mean, my Mom--so we sep--they separated . . . 

00:18:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:18:45
BEN . . . from, yeah. She, yeah, she didn't really get along with him too . . . 

00:18:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:18:50
BEN . . . well, like especially, you know, after the whole separation thing. 

00:18:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Yeah. But it became intolerable for her in terms of him--the way he was, the way he was drinking? 

00:19:00
BEN Yeah. Yeah. I guess so. 

00:19:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Did, did you kids get caught up in it at times? 

00:19:05
BEN Ah, I was a bit, I was a bit young. I didn't really . . . 

00:19:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. But you knew there was fallout from it? 

00:19:15
BEN Yeah, I mean as you get older, you get--you realize these things but . . . 

00:19:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. 

00:19:20
BEN Yeah. 

00:19:20
SANDY WILLIAMS And, and your girlfriend's met your Dad? 

00:19:20
BEN Yeah. 

00:19:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. And so she kind of knows what's happened historically? 

00:19:25
BEN Yeah. 

00:19:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Does that come into play when she's having a bit of a go at you? 

00:19:30
BEN Ah, yes. 

00:19:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:19:30
BEN Yes, it does. 

00:19:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So what do, what do you think is possible from here? What are your options? 

00:19:40
BEN Ah, ah, I could stop drinking. 

00:19:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Altogether? Uh-huh. 

00:19:50
BEN I probably won't do that though. 

00:19:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:19:55
BEN Ah, I, I guess I could just continue. I mean, yeah. 

00:20:00
SANDY WILLIAMS And if you do? 

00:20:05
BEN Ah, well, I guess Sky won't really be satisfied with that, I guess. 

00:20:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:20:15
BEN I mean, I don't know. She might, she might get used to it, I guess. 

00:20:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. You would hope she would get used to it? 

00:20:20
BEN Yes. 

00:20:25
SANDY WILLIAMS But it sounds like she's pretty serious that you need to do something. Hmm? 

00:20:30
BEN Yeah, I guess so. 

00:20:30
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. And it sounds like you don't want to lose her, she matters to you? 

00:20:35
BEN Yeah, definitely. 

00:20:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. So the other option is then . . . 

00:20:40
BEN I guess to still drink but, I don't know, find some sort of compromise. 

00:20:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Some sort of level that she's going to feel okay about and that you're going to feel like you kind of haven't given up. You don't look 100% happy about that but it sounds like you don't think either of those other options are, are on? 

00:21:05
BEN Yeah, I guess. 

00:21:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay, well maybe it will help if we go through some possibilities about how you might peg your drinking back a bit. And you might be able to kind of creep up a bit closer to, to one strategy that sounds a bit more workable. Hmm? 

00:21:20
BEN Sure. 

00:21:20
Problem Solving and Goal Setting 

00:21:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Ben, there's a little exercise we could go through that might be helpful. I imagine if you're on the--a job, you know, with your colleagues, your plastering mates, that if you strike a problem that you get together and, and say we could try this, we could do that, you know, and that you go through a process of elimination to, to get the solution. 

00:21:45
BEN Uh-huh. 

00:21:45
SANDY WILLIAMS So there's a little technique called problem solving in the textbooks that we could go through that will help us whittle down what you think might be a way to go about this. Does that . . . 

00:21:55
BEN Sure, yeah. 

00:21:55
SANDY WILLIAMS . . . sound okay? 

00:21:55
BEN Yeah. 

00:21:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Ah, I might just jot some things down as we, uhm, go through this. Uhm, so if you were to make some changes during the week that you think might get closer towards what your girlfriend would be happy with and what you might also feel reasonably okay about. What are the possibilities? 

00:22:20
BEN Ah, I guess I could not drink on like Mon--you know, the weekend--I mean the week, sorry. 

00:22:30
SANDY WILLIAMS So not drink on, on Monday, Tue-- . . . 

00:22:30
BEN Or, or maybe like limit myself to a couple a night on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday. 

00:22:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Well, hang on. Let's, let's go, not drink at all on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. That's one option, yeah? Okay, now we can put a line through these when we're finished, yeah? 

00:22:45
BEN Yeah, all right. 

00:22:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Ah, that's the other trick about this little process is that you're just go for, go for broke in terms of what's possible . . . 

00:22:50
BEN Okay. 

00:22:50
SANDY WILLIAMS . . . and then we whittle them down and say no, that's not going to work, that's not going to work, yeah? 

00:22:55
BEN All right. 

00:22:55
SANDY WILLIAMS So you could not drink at all on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday? 

00:23:00
BEN Uh-huh. 

00:23:00
SANDY WILLIAMS But still drink Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday at the same rate? 

00:23:00
BEN Yeah, I guess so. 

00:23:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Uh-huh. So the other nights at the same rate. And that's one option. 

00:23:10
BEN Or I could drin--continue sort of drinking on the, like, the whole week except just not as much on the big ones. 

00:23:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So you could drink each night but peg back the number of drinks on the heavy nights. 

00:23:35
BEN Yeah. 

00:23:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:23:40
BEN And I guess I could do without drinking on Sundays cuz, ah, it's Monday hangovers and--aren't too fun. 

00:23:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So you could do without drinking on Sunday at all. Uhm, so that, uhm, Monday you come up fresh as a daisy, yeah? Compared with how you do at the moment, yeah? 

00:24:00
BEN Yeah. 

00:24:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Uhm, let, let's go back to, to the, uhm, pegging back the number of drinks on the heavy nights. What, what sort of territory are we talking about there? 

00:24:15
BEN I don't know, maybe I could still have like, you know, four or five. Maybe just half, half the number. 

00:24:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So four or five pints or whatever the quantity is, yeah? 

00:24:25
BEN Yeah. 

00:24:25
SANDY WILLIAMS On, on the heavy nights. Yeah. Uhm, you can drink a Shandy. My Dad used to drink Shandy. Did you ever have Shandies as a kid? 

00:24:40
BEN Yeah, as a kid. 

00:24:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. 

00:24:40
BEN Yeah, and I couldn't . . . 

00:24:45
SANDY WILLIAMS They're pretty gross, aren't they? 

00:24:45
BEN . . . go back there, no. 

00:24:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Shan--beer and lemonade I think they were. 

00:24:45
BEN Yeah. 

00:24:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. 

00:24:50
BEN I could--might as well have a Portagaf while I was at it. 

00:24:50
SANDY WILLIAMS What's a Portagaf? 

00:24:55
BEN Guinness and lemonade. 

00:24:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. So we won't put Shandies on the list. 

00:25:00
BEN No. 

00:25:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Uhm, is there, I mean, what else might your girlfriend add to the list? Would, would she add anything to this list? 

00:25:10
BEN Uhm, uhm, I don't know. I, I guess she's really just doesn't want me to drink very much, as much, so. 

00:25:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. So we've, at the moment we've got not drink at all on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and the other nights stay drinking at exactly the same rate. We've got drinking each night, but pegging back the number of drinks on the heavy nights and the heavy nights would be Friday and Saturday. 

00:25:40
BEN Yeah, Friday, Saturday. 

00:25:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Uhm, and at the moment you're suggesting maybe cutting down from sort of roughly 10 to roughly five, hmm? 

00:25:55
BEN Yeah. 

00:25:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. And another possibility is doing without drink at all on Sunday so that you're fresh on, on the Monday. Have a look at that and see, see what you think might be, might be workable and we'll, we'll kind of look at how that might happen. 

00:26:15
BEN Ah . . . 

00:26:15
SANDY WILLIAMS If you can read my writing. 

00:26:15
BEN Yeah. So no drink on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. I think number one which is the drink at the same rate on the weekend, I don't know like, that seems to be the, I don't know, I don't think Sky would see any difference. 

00:26:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:26:35
BEN Uhm, num. . . 

00:26:35
SANDY WILLIAMS So that's kind of where her concern is, it's the nights that you really get into it that worry her? 

00:26:40
BEN Yeah, I guess so. 

00:26:40
SANDY WILLIAMS That you might get into stuff that she doesn't like or . . . 

00:26:45
BEN Yeah. Yeah. I suppose so. 

00:26:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:26:45
BEN Uhm, probably two. 

00:26:45
SANDY WILLIAMS What's number two? 

00:26:50
BEN Drink each night but less, and then the--lessen the number in the heavy nights . . . 

00:26:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:26:55
BEN . . . like Friday and Saturday. 

00:26:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So cutting back by about half the amount you would drink on those heavy nights? 

00:27:05
BEN Yeah. 

00:27:05
SANDY WILLIAMS How, how would that look? How feasible would that be? 

00:27:10
BEN I don't know. I guess it would depend on what was happening. I guess I could do it on just a normal Friday or Saturday. But if it was like a birthday or, you know, a special occasion, I think I'd . . . 

00:27:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. 

00:27:20
BEN . . . I might have some. 

00:27:25
SANDY WILLIAMS What, what would you do instead? I mean, if you're out, you know, a little earlier we talked about the fact that you might be drinking from sort of five in the afternoon right through til whatever hour you get home in the morning. If you think about spreading the drinks out over the evening, how, how would that go? How would that look? 

00:27:40
BEN I don't know. Uhm, I guess I could do it. I mean, we don't really pay much attention to what everyone else is drinking. 

00:27:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:27:55
BEN But, ah, yeah, I guess, I guess I could do it. Try. I could it a shot anyway. 

00:28:00
SANDY WILLIAMS So would that mean slowing down your drinks, making them last a bit longer? 

00:28:05
BEN Yeah. 

00:28:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:28:05
BEN Yeah. 

00:28:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Rather than just sort of polishing them off pretty quickly? 

00:28:10
BEN Hmm. 

00:28:10
SANDY WILLIAMS And that--so you're not watching each other that you're going cop a slur from someone about how slow you're drinking or . . . 

00:28:15
BEN Maybe. I guess, uhm, yeah probably. Little bit. 

00:28:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. But it sounds like it's getting serious enough in terms of Sky the, the relationship with Sky . . . 

00:28:30
BEN Yeah. 

00:28:30
SANDY WILLIAMS . . . you're probably going to have to do something. Let me just check these other options. Do without drink on Sunday at all. Uhm, is that--how's that measuring up as a possibility? 

00:28:40
BEN Ah, I mean, that doesn't sound like too bad idea. I mean, I do, I do get, you know, the--a hangover when you go to work is not . . . 

00:28:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:28:50
BEN . . . it definitely something I could probably do without to be honest. 

00:28:55
SANDY WILLIAMS And, and what might you and Sky do on a Sunday that, that would be pleasant that wouldn't require drinking? 

00:29:00
BEN I don't know, go to movies, go to dinner, or, I don't know, anything I guess. 

00:29:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:29:05
BEN Yeah. 

00:29:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So it might be helpful to think about doing something together that didn't expose you to, you know, the, the wish to get into drinking a bit. 

00:29:15
BEN Yeah. 

00:29:15
SANDY WILLIAMS It sounds like then, ah, the plan would be to, to not drink on a Sunday at all, to do something with Sky that's kind of not--doesn't involve drinking. And the other plan would be to drink a little on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday at home after work, you know, couple of beers in the evening. Ah, and then to peg back the drinking on those heavier nights to maybe five . . . 

00:29:50
BEN Yeah. 

00:29:50
SANDY WILLIAMS . . . instead of nine or 10. 

00:29:55
BEN Yeah. 

00:29:55
SANDY WILLIAMS And to slow them down over the course of the evening. 

00:30:00
BEN Yeah. And I guess, you know, like sometimes when we have like a quiet Friday or Saturday, I could not, I could not drink at all, maybe like once every--once in a blue moon, I think, or something. 

00:30:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So it sounds like you're, you're sort of starting to get a bit of a picture about, about the way you might be able to, to grab hold of the reins on your drinking a little bit in, in--because this relationship is so important to you. 

00:30:25
BEN Yeah. 

00:30:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Hmm. How much do you care at the moment? You know, what are you concerned about compared with, with what your girlfriend is? 

00:30:35
BEN I don't know. I mean, I guess the main thing that is the money . . . 

00:30:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:30:40
BEN . . . for me. But yeah. And I guess like the Monday hangover but, ah . . . 

00:30:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:30:50
BEN Yeah. 

00:30:50
SANDY WILLIAMS So there's something in you that's thinking maybe if I wasn't spending quite so much, I might be able to do something else with my money? 

00:30:55
BEN Yeah. 

00:30:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Monday morning fronting up in, in a bit of a fresher state might be a, a state might be a good move? 

00:31:00
BEN Yeah. 

00:31:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Uhm, having Sky feel a bit, bit more comfortable about what's going on is going to be important and . . . yeah. Okay. So those might be reasons that, that would be reasonably convincing for you? 

00:31:20
BEN Yeah, I guess so. Yeah, absolutely. 

00:31:25
SANDY WILLIAMS So is that something you want to give, give a go over the next week and then we'll meet again in a week and, and see how you're traveling with that? 

00:31:30
BEN Sure. Yeah, I'll give it a shot. 

00:31:35
[music] 

00:31:35
Normalising Relapse 

00:31:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Hi Ben. How did you go? 

00:31:40
BEN Ah, I did all right at the start . . . 

00:31:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Uh-huh. 

00:31:45
BEN . . . and, ah, then I may have fucked up. 

00:31:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:31:50
BEN Sorry. 

00:31:50
SANDY WILLIAMS You want to tell me about the fucked bit or the all right bit first? 

00:31:55
BEN Let's go for the all right bit first. 

00:31:55
SANDY WILLIAMS All right, good. 

00:31:55
BEN Ah, I . . . 

00:31:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Which bit was workable? 

00:32:00
BEN Ah, Sunday. 

00:32:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:32:00
BEN Yeah, didn't drink on Sunday. 

00:32:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:32:00
BEN And then felt great on Monday, which is what I wanted to do so. 

00:32:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:32:10
BEN Yeah. 

00:32:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:32:10
BEN It was good. 

00:32:10
SANDY WILLIAMS So that, that--was it--were you surprised that it--it was workable? 

00:32:15
BEN Yeah. Yeah, I was actually. I mean, we didn't--we had a bit of a--we had a nice Sunday and really cruisy and then a really relaxed evening and getting it up--getting up was a lot easier. 

00:32:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. Okay, so there was a bit of--a few rewards tucked away. What about your girlfriend? How did she respond to that? 

00:32:35
BEN Yeah, great. Yeah, she was happy. 

00:32:35
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:32:35
BEN Pleased. 

00:32:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:32:40
BEN She, ah, mentioned it. 

00:32:40
BEN Right. Okay. Good. But . . . 

00:32:45
BEN Ah, I went right back on it again on the Friday and Saturday. 

00:32:50
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:32:50
BEN Yeah. Uhm, Friday night was a friend's birthday and then Saturday night we kind of--we were, you know, it wasn't supposed to be a big night but we kind of just went--I went for like some dinner at a friend's house and I ended up coming home quite drunk. 

00:33:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:33:15
BEN Uhm, we didn't go out but I, I still kind of got on it. 

00:33:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:33:20
BEN And, ah, yeah. 

00:33:20
SANDY WILLIAMS And what, what happened between you and your girlfriend? 

00:33:30
BEN Ah, she wasn't pleased. She, ah, yeah, she, uhm, said that she couldn't, ah, it was a problem with her. It was more the problem--more of a problem than I think I thought it was. 

00:33:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:33:45
SANDY WILLIAMS So she had a notion that coming here would, would what? 

00:33:50
BEN Fix it or, I don't know, make me try to change it, I guess. 

00:34:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So if we look back on last week, there may have been a sense that--on your part that a better give this a shot because she's got her knickers in a knot about this. Uhm, I'm spending quite a bit of money. I'm a bit surprised about how much money I'm spending. 

00:34:20
BEN Uh-huh. 

00:34:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Uhm, but you were kind of hoping it would perhaps settle down. 

00:34:25
BEN Yeah. 

00:34:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Uhm, and there wouldn't be so much fuss about it and you could kind of pretty well keep going how you were. Is that . . . 

00:34:35
BEN Yeah. Yeah, basically. 

00:34:35
SANDY WILLIAMS And how are you feeling now? 

00:34:40
BEN Uhm, a bit stupid I guess. I, I mean, I thought it would be a little bit easier. And, uhm, I guess I didn't really think that it was much of a problem. 

00:34:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:34:55
BEN But, ah, yeah. I think I underestimated how much. 

00:35:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Let, let me tell you that most people who have a bit of a run-up to doing--to changing something about how they use drugs, drink, stuff that's got them into a bit of a strife, that most people go through a similar kind of experience. That they make a decision to do something perhaps in a flash of enthusiasm, well-intentioned and then actually find that the unfolding of it is more difficult. So I don't want you to feel stupid. I don't want you to feel too daunted. I'd like you to think about what it is that is really mattering now and where you want to go from here. 

00:35:40
BEN Okay. Uhm, well, I guess I, I don't want, ah, ah, lose, I don't want to fuck up my relationship. 

00:35:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:35:55
BEN And that's a little bit more, ah, oh, what's--I don't even know the word, ah, like it, it seems more likely now. 

00:36:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. There's, there's a threat to the relationship . . . 

00:36:05
BEN Yeah. 

00:36:05
SANDY WILLIAMS . . . now. 

00:36:05
BEN Yeah. 

00:36:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Okay. So Sky really has given you a message that something's really got to change or . . . 

00:36:10
BEN Or I, I have to leave. 

00:36:15
SANDY WILLIAMS You have to leave? 

00:36:15
BEN Yeah. 

00:36:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Wow. Okay. And you look pretty concerned about this? 

00:36:20
BEN Yeah, reasonably. 

00:36:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Reasonably? 

00:36:25
BEN Yes, I am. Absolutely. 

00:36:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. Hmm. So let's not lose sight of the fact that actually you did do something on Sunday that you're a bit surprised at that wasn't actually as hard you thought it might have been. Hmm? And that you had--there was some, some payoff for that on Monday morning. 

00:36:45
BEN Yeah. 

00:36:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Have you thought about what it is you might be able to do that is actually going to reduce the threat of this relationship floundering on the rocks? Have you thought about what you really want to do about this over the next couple of weeks, to give it another shot? 

00:37:00
BEN Uhm, I guess I can't really, I guess I can't really, ah, just keep on going like I am and expect me to not do it, I think. 

00:37:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:37:15
BEN Uhm, it's just, yeah. It's just really easy. 

00:37:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Is it, is it just a matter of not getting smashed or is it a matter of, uhm . . . 

00:37:25
BEN Well, that's what, I mean, on Friday I didn't-- Friday was a bit different. It was a birthday but I, that I didn't really expect to have any but Saturday, I wasn't intending to get smashed at all. I just wanted to have a couple of drinks. 

00:37:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. 

00:37:40
BEN But, uhm, yeah. 

00:37:40
SANDY WILLIAMS So have you got a notion about what you might need to do differently that would put you less at risk of things getting out of hand? 

00:37:50
BEN Ah, I just don't think that I can really put myself in that situation if I don't want to drink. 

00:38:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So that you might have to change what you do, where you go? 

00:38:00
BEN Yeah, I guess so. For--yeah. I suppose for a little while. 

00:38:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:38:05
BEN But I don't want to, I don't want to like lose--cut off my friends. 

00:38:10
SANDY WILLIAMS Uh-huh. Hmm. 

00:38:10
BEN But yeah. I think, I guess, I guess they'll understand I suppose. I don't know. 

00:38:15
SANDY WILLIAMS Would you talk to them about it? 

00:38:20
BEN Ah, I don't know. 

00:38:20
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. That's something you could think about that maybe, maybe one or two of them, good, good mates, you could say, look, you know, things are bit hairy between Sky and I and, uhm, I'm probably just going to have to quieten down for a bit. Would that be feasible or . . . 

00:38:40
BEN Yeah, I guess so. I mean, they'll, they'll have to--they'll realize it through--one way or another I guess. 

00:38:45
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. And maybe if you get in first rather than waiting to be kind of quizzed about it that might, might be more comfortable? 

00:38:50
BEN Yeah, that's not, that's not a bad idea. 

00:38:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Right. Okay. Well, uhm, it does feel a bit different this week. It feels like, you know, something is kind of percolated and your thinking, shit, I have to do something here I think. 

00:39:05
BEN Yeah. 

00:39:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah. Okay, and I hope you can kind of keep hold of the fact that you did, you did actually manage to do something that you hadn't even contemplated you might be able to, to do. So Ben, you said something a few moments ago that struck me. You said you really hadn't realized how much of a problem this was for you. 

00:39:25
BEN Hmm. 

00:39:25
SANDY WILLIAMS Say a bit more about that. 

00:39:30
BEN Uhm, I guess, I just wasn't, uhm, I was surprised that I just couldn't, I, I didn't do it. 

00:39:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:39:40
BEN I thought that it would be easier. 

00:39:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. You thought you could just put the plan into action and it would work and then . . . 

00:39:45
BEN Yeah. 

00:39:45
SANDY WILLIAMS And when you struck the, the problems that you did this week putting it into action . . . 

00:39:50
BEN Yeah, I mean I had a very, I wanted to but I just didn't. 

00:39:55
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:39:55
BEN And it was, uhm, yeah. It slightly surprised me. 

00:40:00
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. 

00:40:00
BEN I guess, so yeah. I guess. Yeah, it's frustrating. 

00:40:05
SANDY WILLIAMS Okay. So to support you in kind of translating in--that into action, what about we really nail down the coming week, coming couple of weeks, you know. And how it might go day by day so that you've got really quite a structured plan in mind. Uh-huh? 

00:40:20
BEN Okay. 

00:40:20
SANDY WILLIAMS So you don't get perhaps caught off-guard with--cuz I guess there's always going to be birthdays or other kind of things that crop up. 

00:40:30
BEN Yeah. 

00:40:30
SANDY WILLIAMS So what about we spend a bit of time doing that together, uhm, so that you go away with a bit more of a, kind of a bit more flesh on the bone in terms of putting these good intentions into practice. 

00:40:40
BEN Okay. 

00:40:40
SANDY WILLIAMS Yeah? Okay.
