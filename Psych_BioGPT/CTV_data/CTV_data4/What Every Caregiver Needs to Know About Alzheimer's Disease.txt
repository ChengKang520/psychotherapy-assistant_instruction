What Every Caregiver Needs to Know About ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE INTRO 

00:00:10
MADELINE MERCED If you are a caregiver for someone with Alzheimer’s disease, you know it can be a real challenge, but the more you learn about this disease is the more you can help those who live with it. 

00:00:20
Alzheimer’s Disease A D Dementia 

00:00:20
MADELINE MERCED Alzheimer’s Disease AD for short is more than just forgetfulness. It’s a disease of the brain called the Dementia. By far the most common dementia today. In a healthy brain, neurons are the messengers of thoughts and memories. 

00:00:40
Beta-Amyloid Plaques Tangles 

00:00:40
MADELINE MERCED But with A D a protein called Beta-Amyloid attacks the branches between the neurons causing gummy blobs called plaques. While inside, the neuron becomes twisted into use as tangles. 

00:01:00
KIM PETERSEN M.D. What’s happening is brain cells are beginning to die, first they get sick and then after perhaps a year’s time the cell actually dies. 

00:01:05
GAIL PETERSEN Ph.D What we know is that the brain is an amazing organ and it tolerates the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer’s disease, without symptoms for somewhere between 10 and 20 years. 

00:01:20
MADELINE MERCED By then the brain may actually have shrunk by as much as a third the results are devastating. 

00:01:25
GAIL PETERSEN The world doesn’t look the same for them, it doesn’t feel the same, it doesn’t sound the same, actually we know that in early Alzheimer’s disease many people lose their sense of smell or they can still smell, but they can’t interpret what they are smelling. 

00:01:40
MADELINE MERCED But because A D moves so slowly at first its often mistaken for normal ageing, in fact, its anything but… 

00:01:50
KIM PETERSEN This is not just a (inaudible ) of personality that there is something happening to the organ of the brain and that it is sick, it has a disease and is deteriorating over time. 

00:02:00
A D Hippocampus Short-term Memory Problems Temporal Lobe Forget Common Words Frontal Lobe Personality Changes Parietal Lobe Get Lost Easily 

00:02:00
MADELINE MERCED What happens when A D strikes? It depends on what parts or lobe of the brain its affecting. When A D strikes here, in the hippocampus people get short-term memory problems. They forget where they park their car. New information doesn’t stick. When AD attacks the Temporal lobe, where dictionary is stored, they begin to forget common everyday words toothbrush and shoe. When A D spreads to the Frontal Lobe, their personality changes, sometimes without warning. 

00:02:55
No. Don't do it. No. 

00:03:00
MADELINE MERCED They are just not the person they used to be and when A D impairs the Parietal lobe, they get lost easily. They forget how to do things they’ve done for years, find numbers confusing and don’t know the date or the year, until the day comes when they don’t recognize their own children. They need help with every aspect of their lives. 

00:03:35
MADELINE MERCED  In this program, you will meet people in all phases of the disease. 

00:03:40
Helen Ranney Lee Ammentorp Evelyn Bringe Jeanette Rouse 

00:03:45
MADELINE MERCED From MCI, which is not Alzheimer’s, but may precede it, through early, moderate and severe. You’ll learn about tests that are used to determine whether a person has A D. 

00:04:00
MADELINE MERCED And you will hear from caregivers who work everyday with this population. 

00:04:05
Clock Draw Test 

00:04:05
RICK DAHL Caregiver They do appreciate what you are doing for them in the moment and you are the person that can guide them through each moment and help them to feel comfortable and help take away their fear. 

00:04:15
JANELLE ZACHO Caregiver The disease robs them of much of their personhood, it robs them of their dignities, it robs them of their social skills but in there is still the person that was born onto this earth and we have to keep pulling out some little piece of them. 

00:04:35
MADELINE MERCED That’s the challenge To learn about A D and make life better for those who live with it. 

00:04:45

00:04:55
What Every Caregiver Needs to Know About ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) Memory “glitch” 

00:04:55
MADELINE MERCED Ever try to remember something and couldn’t when the answer was right on the tip of your tongue very frustrating. We call this a memory glitch and we all have one from time-to-time. 

00:05:05
MADELINE MERCED But for people with mild cognitive impairment or MCI, it happens far too often. 

00:05:10
MCI Mild Cognitive Impairment 

00:05:15
GAIL PETERSEN They realize that these glitches are happening more frequently and they can’t be explained away by oh, I was sick, I really didn’t feel well, or I was really distracted. 

00:05:25
KIM PETERSEN But they appear to function very normally, so it is really about the only thing that’s… that’s different is they are having trouble learning new information, but they are certainly not demented, and so we don’t refer to the fact they have a dementia or that they have Alzheimer’s disease. 

00:05:35
Hippo-campus Short-Term Memory Forget words 

00:05:40
MADELINE MERCED With MCI, their physical changes going on here in the Hippocampus. The Hippocampus covering short-term memory, it decides if a thought should be stored long-term or can be safely forgotten. In a person with MCI, the hippocampus is slowly being damaged. So, while their long-term memory is good, their short-term memory begins to worsen. They might miss a birthday, who hasn’t done that. They might forget a common word now and again. It’s on the tip of their tongue, they spend a lot of time searching for things they have misplaced. 

00:06:30
9:30 tomorrow… 

00:06:30
MADELINE MERCED They ask the same question again and again. 

00:06:35
I… I don't think so. 

00:06:35
Repetitive Questions 

00:06:35
MADELINE MERCED Because they forgotten the answer. 

00:06:40
GAIL PETERSEN People may ask repeatedly about an appointment because they know it’s important and they are very concerned that they are gonna forget it. Many times repetitive questions kind of well about of a real need for reassurance and… and comfort and feeling in control. 

00:06:55
Less confident Quick to Anger 

00:06:55
MADELINE MERCED They are starting to feel a bit less confident. In frustration, they maybe quick to anger and blame others. MCI is different than normal forgetfulness because these glitches happen more and more often. 

00:07:15
KIM PETERSEN We all forget where we put our cars and our keys and… and we know forget peoples names and sometimes forget important things, but it is in the pattern. 

00:07:20
MADELINE MERCED Even the person with MCI senses that something is wrong. 

00:07:25
KIM PETERSEN The memory glitches are serious, they are major life things that are important to the person to remember and they are truly forgetting. 

00:07:40
Living With ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE MCI 

00:07:40
MADELINE MERCED Helen was recently diagnosed with MCI. She has seen these changes first hand. 

00:07:50
HELEN RANNEY Well, an example that forgetfulness that I’ve always had is, is worse. I go up to the square with some errand I have in mind for Walgreens and maybe forget what I have gone for. 

00:08:00
Lists 

00:08:05
MADELINE MERCED Helen compensates by making lists, little reminders of her own thoughts, and she is relying on them more and more. 

00:08:10
HELEN RANNEY I need to write more things down to keep track of where I’m going, what I’m going to do, and then double checking it, if I can find a list all as well. 

00:08:25
MADELINE MERCED Lists help but short-term memory problems can have big effects on every day life. 

00:08:35
KIM PETERSEN You often hear of more difficulty balancing the cheque book or forgetting to move the number that you write on the cheque into the cheque register, they are forgotten them when they go to balance those cheques just aren't there. 

00:08:45
HELEN RANNEY Well, those numbers didn’t make enough sense to me, you know how much money that I really have in the bank. 

00:08:55
GAIL PETERSEN Some people say, I was used to balance my cheque book, don’t without a thought, and now you look at it and its just a muddle. 

00:09:00
HELEN RANNEY I do some maths and it wouldn’t come out right and I guess that’s muddled. 

00:09:10
KIM PETERSEN And it is a change from their baseline, they used to be good at it, now they can’t do it. 

00:09:10
MCI advances to AD Physical Memory Tests 

00:09:15
MADELINE MERCED MCI is not a Alzheimer’s disease, but it can precede it. 

00:09:20
MADELINE MERCED For every eight people with MCI one will advance to A D each year. 

00:09:25
KIM PETERSEN Watch it, keep your eyes on my finger… 

00:09:30
MADELINE MERCED This might be the time to get a physical and depression screening. 

00:09:30
KIM PETERSEN Pretty good. 

00:09:35
MADELINE MERCED Some common memory tests like the mini mental exam do not pick up MCI, others are more sensitive like a verbal fluency test, one minute to name as many animals as you can. All these test the clock draw. 

00:09:50
Clock Draw Test 

00:09:50
GAIL PETERSEN Would you please draw me a clock face and put the numbers on it. Although that seems very simple it’s quite a difficult task. It looks that a number of different areas in our prime. Now, would you please put hands on the clock to read 2:45. Generally, a mild cognitive impairment people draw a clock that’s perfect or pretty close to perfect, but sometimes you’ll pickup some subtle errors. 

00:10:25
MADELINE MERCED Maybe the hour hand is slightly too long or closer to the 2 than it should be. These subtle errors may indicate changes in thinking ability. 

00:10:35
MADELINE MERCED If MCI is diagnosed, a doctor may recommend strategies to slow or stop its advance into A D. 

00:10:45
It’s going to be on Tuesday… 

00:10:45
Tuesday. 

00:10:45
Simplify & Organize Daily Routine 

00:10:50
MADELINE MERCED Meanwhile simplify and organize. This is a time when a caregiver can really help, set up a daily routine. 

00:11:00
Tuesday at 10:00, I am going to go with… 

00:11:00
Simple Calendar 

00:11:00
MADELINE MERCED If they have problems with dates create a simple calendar. 

00:11:05
I forgot. 

00:11:05
…so that you can remember. 

00:11:05
Medications Exercise 

00:11:10
MADELINE MERCED And the medication reminder system, exercise. 

00:11:15
KIM PETERSEN You got to take care of yourself because your brain is trying to fight off the Alzheimer’s disease. 

00:11:25
MADELINE MERCED With some the help from her daughter Helen lives independently in this apartment complex. 

00:11:30
HELEN RANNEY Just try for me, I have all the freedom that I could want, we have a swimming pool here and I work very hard doing exercises, so I at the moment, I am hiking around pretty well. 

00:11:45
MADELINE MERCED Unlike Helen, some people with MCI shows signs of depression. 

00:11:50
GAIL PETERSEN They kind of lose interest in their favorite activities and sometimes even doing things for themselves like getting the exercise they need or fixing nutritious food. 

00:11:55
Stay Active 

00:12:00
MADELINE MERCED To avoid this, stay mentally and socially active. 

00:12:05
KIM PETERSEN The better you keep your mind active, the better chances you are going to have because those neurons, little nerve cells are still most of them are very healthy. If you stimulate ‘em they are going to grow new connections, and if they have not been intellectually curious in learning new things now it’s the time to start doing it. 

00:12:25
HELEN RANNEY I have played a recorder a number of the years. I take lessons and work very hard. I played just the other day, and I got wow, this feels so good, I read that music can be very helpful with memory loss and by going, it seems to be true. To the best, I can on with the show. 

00:12:55

00:13:05
What Every Caregiver Needs to Know About ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE EARLY 

00:13:10
MADELINE MERCED People with early Alzheimer’s disease have more and more memory glitches, but as the disease continues their lives are about to change even more. 

00:13:20
KIM PETERSEN The early stage is progressing beyond just memory problems, now its being to affect your living skills. 

00:13:25
GAIL PETERSEN It may be word finding, it maybe getting lost or… or not being able to find their way around. It maybe not understanding numbers or time anymore, it maybe that their judgments really changing. 

00:13:35
Hippo-campus Short-term Memory Glitches Repetitive Questions Repetitive Speech Lose Their Thought Forget Visits Forget Steps in Task 

00:13:35
MADELINE MERCED In early A D damage to the Hippocampus continues and so do the glitches and short-term memory. People with early A D may ask the same question again and again… 

00:13:50
Repetitive Questions 

00:13:50
What time you gotta pick me up? What time you are gonna pick me up? Could you say at what time you are going to pick me up? 

00:14:00
MADELINE MERCED Or repeat a story almost a word for word. 

00:14:00
Repetitive Speech 

00:14:00
These two guys they are fishing and while one made to cast and then, two guys were fishing and... 

00:14:05
Forget Visits 

00:14:10
MADELINE MERCED And often they lose their train of thought. They forget a recent visit from a friend and forget some steps when they do a task, like while making coffee, they may forget the coffee grounds. 

00:14:25
KIM PETERSEN People in the early stage can do something as long as they are not asked to do too many things in a row, help them do the steps then they can have the success of making the whole pot of coffee. 

00:14:35
GAIL PETERSEN One patient we had loved to bake, but she could never remember how many cups of sugar or flour she put in and so got posted notes and every time she put in a cup of sugar or flour, she put a posted note down, and so she found her on way to go step by step. 

00:14:55
Temporal Lobe Our “Dictionary” 

00:14:55
MADELINE MERCED Another area that has been damaged is the temporal lobe. It’s the place where our dictionary is stored. 

00:15:00
KIM PETERSEN People begin to have trouble describing what something is called, and they’ll often make a statement of while you know the thing about Jager(phg) then what should I call it? 

00:15:10
Block On Word 

00:15:10
MADELINE MERCED People will just simply block on a word. 

00:15:15
What do you call that thing is distress you about(ph)? 

00:15:20
MADELINE MERCED And these words are not unusual. There are words like toothbrush and they are being forgotten. 

00:15:25
GAIL PETERSEN It gets more and more frequent and pretty soon you are playing 20 questions trying to decide what they maybe trying to say. 

00:15:30
Trouble Reading 

00:15:35
MADELINE MERCED They also have trouble reading and remembering what they just read. They might leave through a book without reading it. 

00:15:40
GAIL PETERSEN And a number of our patients who have been avid readers, quit reading novels because they can’t follow the story any longer. 

00:15:45
Withdrawn Angry Outbursts 

00:15:50
MADELINE MERCED As the frontal lobe becomes effected, the personality may change, they may get fleeced by a home improvement scheme or endlessly enter a contest. They become more withdrawn or depressed. Their moods may change with more angry outbursts. 

00:16:15
KIM PETERSEN They can become more irritable, if they are pushed a little bit or challenged to do something that they are having trouble with, to protect yourselves we begin to lash out and say leave me alone, I don’t want to do that and that’s a change in their normal perhaps he would have been a very cooperative a happy go lucky, easy to deal with person. 

00:16:30
GAIL PETERSEN We see people who are sometimes really swing between almost being euphoric and getting away too happy and then really being down in the dumps or we see people who just boil up. 

00:16:40
Parietal Lobe Numbers Read & Write Recognize People, Places & Things Become Lost Numbers Confuse Forget Date Forget Names 

00:16:45
MADELINE MERCED The parietal lobe is also affected, this is the part of the brain that helps us using numbers read and write and produce language. It also helps us recognize people places and things. As a result people with early A D may become lost in unfamiliar places or no longer be able to read a map. Numbers confuse, prices may no longer make sense. They will know the day and time, but forget the date. They have trouble remembering how to use the new remote control. More often they are getting names confused. 

00:17:35
Hi, Grandma. 

00:17:35
Yeah, David. 

00:17:40
I’m not David. I’m Tyler. 

00:17:40
Oh… 

00:17:40
MADELINE MERCED Even familiar names. 

00:17:45
MADELINE MERCED This is the time for a thorough memory assessment and treatment plan from a neurophysiologist or a memory diagnostic center. 

00:17:50
Clock Draw Test 

00:17:55
MADELINE MERCED The clock draw test help show what’s going on in their minds. When asked to draw a clock face and set its hands to 2:45 they draw this. 

00:18:05
GAIL PETERSEN For what you see is, is a very poorly drawn circle, and then they may have more numbers on one side of the clock than the other. They start to lose the ability to understand that the clock has two hands, so they may write in 45. 

00:18:20
Stop Driving Simplify & Organize Medications Daily Schedule 

00:18:20
MADELINE MECED If they have in already, its time to stop driving a car. As a caregiver help simplify and organize their daily routines, make the living environment safer by removing clutter. Set up a medication reminder system to make sure medications are taken accurately and keep a daily schedule. 

00:18:50
MADELINE MERCED This will be a time of increased stress because the person with early A D maybe very aware of their own decline. 

00:19:00
KIM PETERSEN You begin to feel increasing feelings of worthlessness being a burden, being a child again, all those thoughts go through the Alzheimer persons mind. 

00:19:10
Be Supportive Support Group Legal Matters 

00:19:10
MADELINE MERCED Caregivers should be reassuring and supportive, use humor to keep things light. 

00:19:20
MADELINE MERCED Encourage family to attend support groups and get information and support from the Alzheimer’s association. 

00:19:25
MADELINE MERCED Its time to get legal matters straightened out like financial planning and power of attorney. 

00:19:30
MADELINE MERCED And there are treatments that can improve symptoms and slow the progress of A D. The earlier they started, the better the results. 

00:19:45
Living With ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE EARLY 

00:19:50
LEE AMMENTORP I have spent 26 years in Vancouver and there are all kinds of different things and in all climbs and places as they might go, him goes and then in the mall and from Alaska to Vietnam, Korea umm… I can’t think a hell of what next place. (inaudible ) right now. But the one right below Vietnam. 

00:20:25
JANET AMMENTORP A short-term memory is extremely poor. I can’t say it’s good. It’s not even as poor, it’s very poor. 

00:20:40
LEE AMMENTORP Go to Korea… 

00:20:40
JANET AMMENTORP He can’t remember. 

00:20:45
LEE AMMENTORP I became aware that I didn’t have short remembering like I did have. 

00:20:50
JANET AMMENTORP He was becoming repetitive and he was forgetting all the little things… 

00:20:55
LEE AMMENTORP Well, something is missing and if we’re kind of done because things that we used to do without ever any thought. Just they aren’t there in the memory or you know you can’t juggle things around and compare with things or whatever you know what I mean… 

00:21:15
JANET AMMENTORP Lee said, I can’t balance the checkbook. I can’t make my books come out. Lee never make mistake, always balanced. So there was a big bread for… 

00:21:30
LEE AMMENTORP We had our doctor before as to a couple of different specialists and… 

00:21:34
JANET AMMENTORP Both of them would administer the mini exam, the mini mental exam where you are required to remember three things and to count backwards from a 100/7. Lee could do both of those things. 

00:21:50
LEE AMMENTORP We didn’t get any real answers and written more any real specific diagnosis. 

00:21:55
JANET AMMENTORP They would say, get out of here and there is nothing wrong, but I knew, a spouse always knows, always, always knows. 

00:22:05
MADELINE MERCED When Lee finally got the diagnosis from a memory diagnostic center, he took it and stride. 

00:22:10
LEE AMMENTORP But I know what my limitations and I just learned to adapt to what it is and the… and the… to the best I can with it. 

00:22:20
JANET AMMENTORP It’s got a name. It’s got a face and we’ll deal with it. We deal with it. 

00:22:25
Medication 

00:22:25
MADELINE MERCED His doctors started Lee on a course of medication to slow the disease. 

00:22:30
JANET AMMENTORP I think it might have been like six months later and he was better, I mean he was more alert and tracking things better. 

00:22:40
Stop Driving 

00:22:40
MADELINE MERCED Even so, Lee made up his mind. He would stop driving a car. 

00:22:45
LEE AMMENTORP It was very simple that if I was driving and we got an accident and hurt or killed someone boy, I mean that would be the end of it. So, we don’t take that risk. 

00:23:00
MADELINE MERCED This was one of many life changes Lee and Janet made. Another was the schedule. 

00:23:05
Schedule 

00:23:10
JANET AMMENTORP We have a daily schedule, we have a monthly schedule, we have a weekly schedule. Tomorrow morning at eight, we have to do the… I do it for the week and I log down everything that we’re going to do. 

00:23:20
LEE AMMENTORP So, we… I don’t forget. We don’t forget to do anything because everything is almost organized to just go down the list. 

00:23:25
JANET AMMENTORP Thursday, we’ll… 

00:23:25
LEE AMMENTORP We are very organized between the nurse and (inaudible ) comes with the territory that we did it before. 

00:23:35
JANET AMMENTORP I didn’t use to keep it quite so detail. Now, I do. And so, Lee goes and looks at the calendar frequently to remind himself on what’s going on. 

00:23:45
MADELINE MERCED A schedule is a useful tool, especially when Lee ask about something again and again… 

00:23:50
JANET AMMENTORP I’ll say, you know that’s the eight time in a row now, maybe we should write that down or well, I suppose that be a good idea, if that’s been that many times, and we just laugh about it a lot, I mean you just do me to keep a sense of humor. Yes, he has wonderful sense of humor. 

00:24:05
Adaptations 

00:24:10
MADELINE MERCED They have also made some adaptations around the house as gentle reminders like how to make the perfect cup of tea. 

00:24:15
JANET AMMENTORP We’re tea drinkers and I like half a cup of tea and he likes a whole cup of tea. So, we have a picture of that. He put the marks on it to know exactly where to put the water. 

00:24:30
[sil.] 

00:24:35
JANET AMMENTORP The water is another problem because tea water, we use the distilled water and well water goes in the Brita We make ice cubes out of that. If you go in our kitchen, some place you will see a ticket that says, what kind of water goes where? 

00:24:50
Keep active 

00:24:50
MADELINE MERCED Each day, Lee does a variety of things to keep his mind active from crossword puzzles and memory building cards, to exercise. 

00:25:00
Exercise 

00:25:00
LEE AMMENTORP We’ve always walk and parks and trails all around here for one mile or two mile or three mile or hmm… where do we go today. 

00:25:15
JANET AMMENTORP We are just going to deal with it each day at the time, continue to live the life and do the things you’ve always done. 

00:25:25
MADELINE MERCED This year, they’re planning a cruise to the Caribbean. 

00:25:25
JANET AMMENTORP I think all of those things I help him keep him where he is that the disease is not progressing as fast as it can. 

00:25:35
LEE AMMENTORP I knew that the problem existed and I knew what happened to my dad and state that he went through. 

00:25:45
JANET AMMENTORP Our son had see his grandpa(ph) go through this and now he’s dead you know it’s not fair. 

00:25:50
LEE AMMENTORP Greatest by saying, in my life having this wonderful nurse who understands it all and knows how to cope with it and deal with it. 

00:26:00
JANET AMMENTORP I don’t think of him as having Alzheimer’s disease. He is my husband and for better, for worse sickness and then health. So, I’m gonna to do my job. 

00:26:15

00:26:25
What Every Caregiver Needs to Know About ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE MODERATE 

00:26:30
MADELINE MERCED For people with the moderate disability of A D, thoughts are becoming confused and disorganized. 

00:26:35
KIM PETERSEN I think the signs that we hear from our patients is that everything is getting more difficult. Their language often deteriorates even further. They are having more trouble, finding words at all, not just an occasional slip, but now they’re really grasping for language. 

00:26:45
Damage Continues Plaques Tangles 

00:26:50
MADELINE MERCED Damage is the brain continues, in the branches between nerve cells, sticky clumps of protein called plaques disrupt the connections. While inside the nerve cell, tangles formed, choking of the flow of nutrients. As more and more nerve cells die, the brain shrinks. 

00:27:10
Hippocampus 80% - 90% Not Functioning 

00:27:15
KIM PETERSEN The Hippocampus, which is responsible for short-term memory is pretty well devastated about 80 to 90% of the cells are go on or not functioning at this stage. That begins to change their perception of what’s going on in the world, they forget that they forgotten. 

00:27:30
Clock Draw Test 

00:27:30
MADELINE MERCED When they take the clock draw test, the change has become clear. 

00:27:35
KIM PETERSEN Well, now they’re really having trouble with the whole concept of time. 

00:27:40
GAIL PETERSEN By this time, it’s very difficult for people to draw clock and you will see lots of errors. They may actually put hands to two, four and five. 

00:27:45
Confusion 

00:27:50
MADELINE MERCED Their life is full of confusion. They forget things almost immediately. Often they don’t know what time it is or where they are. 

00:28:05
JENNIFER JOHNSON Caregiver So sometimes, you wake up, you think it’s early in the morning, but it’s really evening. So, when someone who’s not you know if they’re a caregiver and you’re coming in and you are saying hi, it’s supper time. They are thrown into kind of a state of panic and anxiety because they think that they are waking up in the morning. 

00:28:20
Wandering 

00:28:20
MADELINE MERCED They may go wandering and get lost. 

00:28:25
JENNIFER JOHNSON I have had to go with my car to pick someone up who just not through in a line, he’s not through a locked door and ended up on the street without a coat and dressed like hospital gown, there is many who denies what their main job. 

00:28:40
Trouble Dressing 

00:28:45
MADELINE MERCED On their own, they have trouble dressing. 

00:28:45
GAIL PETERSEN And so, you may see someone coming out with three ties on or with underwear on outside their pants because the sequence how you do something in order has broken down. 

00:28:55
Well… 

00:29:00
MADELINE MERCED They may not want to take a bath. 

00:29:00
I just had a bath. 

00:29:05
HEIDI OTTO Caregiver I know some people they don’t like to take baths. We have a blue tub and sometimes, they say, well let’s go in the blue boat and we’ll go for a little ride and she hops in the tub and away we go. 

00:29:15
BARB BAUER Caregiver One of our client hates showering, just hates it. And she lives in a home where people are constantly telling her you have to take a shower and I asked her just last week, right, is this so important to you that you don't like taking showers? She said well, if they would sweet about it, maybe I would. 

00:29:30
Daily Living Skills Repetitive Actions 

00:29:35
MADELINE MERCED They need help with daily living skills, like toileting because they are in continent much of the time, they lose awareness of their body have trouble simply sitting in a chair. Their actions become repetitive, they rub their hands, body rock, tap a foot or fold a cloth. 

00:29:55
GAIL PETERSEN By this time, people are having trouble sort of filling their day. So they may latch on to something and just do it over and over and over. 

00:30:05
Repetitive Speech Misperceptions 

00:30:05
MADELINE MERCED Speech also becomes repetitive and later a jumble of words. 

00:30:10
MADELINE MERCED  Misperceptions are common. They see a plant and think its a toilet. 

00:30:20
CINDY MCCALLUM Caregiver When she is eating a meal, she’ll see her food, it floating in the air, and she will say you know what's my meatball doing up there? 

00:30:35
Let's go good girl, come on. Lets go. 

00:30:35
MADELINE MERCED Their world is becoming scrambled and confused. 

00:30:40
That's fine. Its okay, its okay, it’s okay. 

00:30:45
MADELINE MERCED And their caregiver, they are linked to reality. 

00:30:50
RICK DAHL I’ve seen people be walking a lot and you know would… would sense stop abruptly because the floor changes, and to them it might look like water or looks like an uneven surface. 

00:31:05
KIM PETERSEN Many older people in mid-stage dementias do not like curtains left open, the glassy that reflects back with the sea shadows, walking around the house, so you usually close drapes and may can feel secure. 

00:31:15
Let them know they’re safe, that's a big thing that I’ve learned actually in the last few years. I want to know that you are in a safe place, we are going to take care of you. 

00:31:25
BARB BAUER I find as gentle as I can be with these people the more a fact of it is because they really are in a constant state of anxiety. 

00:31:35
But not now… 

00:31:35
Mood Swings 

00:31:35
MADELINE MERCED With time, their mood swings become more impulsive. 

00:31:40
We can't. 

00:31:40
MADELINE MERCED And sometimes out of control. 

00:31:40
Now you get out. 

00:31:45
VALENTINE OLUCHI Caregiver Well, I’ve been called all kinds of names, I’ve been called the son of a… you know that he is an SOB when I was actually changing their diapers or changing their clothes. 

00:31:55
STACEY BALDWIN Caregiver Never argue with a resident, ever because you’ll never ever, ever win. And I always tell him I could bet you my paycheck. Ah you will never win an argument with someone with dementias, I don’t even go there. 

00:32:05
Sundowning 

00:32:05
MADELINE MERCED As the day was on, and they become tired, they may experience sundowning becoming more anxious, agitated and aggressive. 

00:32:15
JANELLE ZACHO There is something agitating them and generally, they can't tell you what it is. If there’s someone who just wants to pace and pace and pace and pace, then let him pace give him a safe place and let them go, maybe turn on some march music, help them pace. 

00:32:35
KIM PETERSEN Many people in the middle stages of Dementia will lose weight hardly because they are not always eating as much as they should, but we think they are also burning off a lot more energy and they may need to be fed more snacks and high energy foods to make up for them. 

00:32:45
I get like little finger foods so people don't have to sit still and concentrate on a meal, if they are people who pace, who just need to keep walking, keep walking. I can walk with them and feed them with peanut butter don’t like sandwich that’s you know cut up in the little squares. 

00:33:05
MADELINE MERCED They often nap during the day because they don't sleep solidly at night. More and more the person in the mirror is becoming a stranger. 

00:33:20
MADELINE MERCED For caregivers people like this can pose a real challenge, its critical to be reassuring and gentle. They can hear it in your voice. 

00:33:30
VALENTINE OLUCHI Sometimes, they will start crying where am I and I have to go home and all that. And we tried to explain, try to let them know that we are all family now and said things that to calm them down and make them comfortable. 

00:33:50
Is that good? 

00:33:50
Compassionate Touch 

00:33:50
MADELINE MERCED Give compassionate touch. 

00:33:50
Well, wonderful. 

00:33:55
Activities 

00:33:55
MADELINE MERCED Find activities that interest them. 

00:34:00
Excellent. Insert it and turn it right… 

00:34:00
Simplify 

00:34:05
MADELINE MERCED Simplify. If you have a complex test for him make it simpler. 

00:34:10
Hey, George you pick up your socks. 

00:34:15
MADELINE MERCED Break it down into smaller steps. 

00:34:15
How about you put your foot into your sock. Can you try that? Very good. Now, could you put your foot into your shoe? Very good, very good. Good job. Thank you. 

00:34:40
BARB BAUER For one of our clients, forget to get out the car, she needs direction as to swing your feet over, put your hands in the car door, stand up and each small step one at a time. 

00:34:55
GAIL PETERSEN I think many times if we just do a little bit of cueing, we can get people too have a peace of an activity, even if they can't do a whole thing. 

00:35:00
SHARON HUGGINS Caregiver When it’s getting to be lunch time, we might actually put out the bread and we might actually put out the lettuce and the tomato and the ingredients and kind of line them up on the counter and then when she comes out to the kitchen, it's all sort of lined up, so she still puts it together, but we’ve helped her step it. 

00:35:20
Brightly Lit 

00:35:25
MADELINE MERCED Keep their environment as pleasant as you can, play soothing music. 

00:35:30
MADELINE MERCED And to keep rooms brightly led all day. All older people need more light, but for people with A D, darkness can lead to depression and greater confusion. 

00:35:40
KIM PETERSEN Shadows begin to move and change and so, that's one of the things caregiver should do is eliminate shadows in the home because they begin to look menacing. 

00:35:50
VIRGINIA WICKMAN Caregiver Turn on as many lights as you possibly can and get more if you can because the brighter, the better. 

00:35:55
MADELINE MERCER Photos and memory books help them recall their past. 

00:36:00
Ah… Look who’s here. 

00:36:05
Ah... My husband. 

00:36:05
I don't think so. I think it is your son. 

00:36:10
MADELINE MERCER A past that is slowly slipping away from them. 

00:36:15

Living With ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE MODERATE 

00:36:20
EVELYN BRINGE I go my away, you go your way. It merely you. 

00:36:35
ED BRINGE She started running away up two or three in the morning she will get up and sneak out and start running down the road. It was over a year and I tried to keep her by myself without any help. I really didn't know what was happening, you know at first you know I thought it was just old age, I couldn’t remember anyone, but… but it was the Alzheimer’s. 

00:37:00
MADELINE MERCED Evelyn moved to a skilled nursing care facility. 

00:37:05
ED BRINGE When… when they first came here, we could carry on little conversation and everything you know, but now on the last year or so she is can’t resist over with, she don’t wanna talk anymore. 

00:37:15
JONI NYGARD Evelyn, do you know why you live here at this care facility? 

00:37:20
EVELYN BRINGE Wooo? 

00:37:20
JONI NYGARD Do you know why you live here? 

00:37:25
EVELYN BRINGE No. 

00:37:25
JONI NYGARD Do you ever have trouble with your memory? 

00:37:35
EVELYN BRINGE I guess that it not. 

00:37:35
MADELINE MERCER To help her remember, caregivers have gathered some pictures from Evelyn's past. 

00:37:40
ED BRINGE The pictures on the both board, she likes to look at all the time you know. So family, not too good at it lately, but she could pick them all out and tell you who they were, and what their names were everything. And then pictures they took around here in and that… with people that she knew and she likes them too you know. 

00:38:10
MADELINE MERCER Evelyn always loved music, especially guitar. 

00:38:10
ED BRINGE She pays lot of her time only to sit to play in a guitar, you know. 

00:38:15
JONI NYGARD When last did she play her guitar? 

00:38:20
ED BRINGE Oh! Three, four years ago. 

00:38:20
JONI NYGARD You play guitar? 

00:38:25
EVELYN BRINGE Guitar, guitar. 

00:38:25
JONI NYGARD Do you like to sing? 

00:38:30
EVELYN BRINGE Sing. 

00:38:30
JONI NYGARD Sing? 

00:38:35
EVELYN BRINGE No more singing. I can't. No more singing. 

00:38:40
ED BRINGE All… all the time her foot goes I don't know that's for the music or if its… what the heck it’s from. She would does gonna sleep, but she sleep and her foot goes. She likes to sleep, sleeps all the time. 

00:38:55
MADELINE MERCER But even now there are activities that can interest and stimulate her mind. 

00:39:00
ED BRINGE Pretty. 

00:39:00
EVELYN BRINGE Yeah, the… the colors are pretty. 

00:39:00
ED BRINGE Yeah. That occurred you know. 

00:39:00
EVELYN BRINGE It’s nice. 

00:39:10
[sil.] 

00:39:15
Oh! Danny boy, the pipes… the pipes are going… 

00:39:15
We have wonderful girls here. And then if I had a problem I go to him and talk to her (inaudible ). 

00:39:25
ED BRINGE Am I your husband or your brother? One of your brothers? But you know how I am honey. 

00:39:35
EVELYN BRINGE Hmm… 

00:39:35
ED BRINGE Do you know who I am? 

00:39:35
EVELYN BRINGE Yeah. 

00:39:40
ED BRINGE Who? Who am I? Hmm…? She always used to when I, as soon as I walk through the doors and ways, you know. But now she’s like think a minute and look at me. Evelyn certainly going on four years now, and that’s why I spend everyday, yeah. So my life is almost over too, you see. 

00:40:00

00:40:35
What Every Caregiver Needs to Know About ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE SEVERE 

00:40:35
MADELINE MERCER Severe A D is the last and most disabling step in this disease. These people need help in every aspect of their lives. 

00:40:50
MADELINE MERCED By now, their brain may have shrunk by a third. The devastation of A D is nearly complete. 

00:40:55
Sleep 

00:41:00
KIM PETERSEN It robs the brain of so much neural function in critical areas that they are not able to eat independently anymore their motor skills of walking and… and ambulating are lost. They forget how to walk. They really forget who they were, not recognize their home or their spouse anymore. They are living in a different world. They sleep a lot more, much of their day they spend in sleeping or napping, just like an infant. 

00:41:30
Primitive Reflexes 

00:41:35
GAIL PETERSEN You notice those primitive reflexes that babies have. 

00:41:35
But move it with little bit… 

00:41:40
GAIL PETERSEN If you get your hand close to them, are you clothing, they will grab on. 

00:41:45
Oops! Oops! That’s my sleeve. 

00:41:45
GAIL PETERSEN And its not that they are being aggressive, they just don't know anymore how to let go. 

00:41:50
Come on… 

00:41:50
Umm…Umm… 

00:41:55
Please open up. 

00:41:55
Ah… 

00:41:55
Yeah. Good girl. Thank you. 

00:41:55
GAIL PETERSEN They have a style of reflex, so if there’s a loud noise, they will jerk more than any other rest of us would do, and you know it appears to really frighten them a great deal. 

00:42:05
I’ll try to swing. 

00:42:05
Okay. 

00:42:10
MADELINE MERCER Their bodies maybe stiff and rigid or they may have trouble just holding their head up. 

00:42:15
GAIL PETERSEN They may have some jerky muscle spasms, that's part and parcel of the devastating damage in their brain. Their muscles just don’t know how to relax anymore. 

00:42:30
MADELINE MERCER They are also forgetting how to do simple everyday things like how to feed themselves. 

00:42:35
Eating 

00:42:35
JENNIFER JOHNSON People actually forget how to eat, how you use a knife and fork, they forget how to swallow sometimes. 

00:42:45
MADELINE MERCER Now, foods need to be puréed or liquid. And choking is always a concern. 

00:42:50
Language 

00:42:55
KIM PETERSEN Language deteriorates, instead of maybe two or three words, maybe only one word, one word repetitiously. 

00:43:05
GAIL PETERSEN Sort of sing song or syllable over and over… and sometimes you can listen to that and sense their mood from how they say that. 

00:43:15
KIM PETERSEN We’re not sure whether they still understand there’s some evidence that the comprehension of what we’re saying maybe intact for some patients, but their ability to answer back in any meaningful way maybe impaired. 

00:43:25
GAIL PETERSEN Make sure your vocal quality is pleasant and happy and light. When you are… you are working with your loved one or this person for whom you are caring because if they sense a new, discord or unhappiness or fear or whatever, they take your emotion on. So that's something that is very, very important that recreation of that remains very late in the disease. 

00:43:55
BARB BAUER Non-verbal communication being close to the person touching them, looking them out in the eye, talking calmly and gently and they need to feel trust because they literally have to trust you. They are dependent on you to do the next thing that they have to do in their life. 

00:44:15
So I’m gonna be brushing your hair. 

00:44:15
Explain 

00:44:20
MADELINE MERCER While you are caring for them, it’s good practice to simply explain what you are doing. Let them know what's happening… 

00:44:25
You know hopefully, I won't be pulling too hard, but I need to do that. 

00:44:30
Clothing 

00:44:30
MADELINE MERCER Because people are less active, skin breakdown is a constant concern and the possibility of infection. 

00:44:40
MADELINE MERCED Clothing is also important, preferably cotton with no buttons or zippers and comfortable to the touch. 

00:44:45
Touch 

00:44:45
JANELLE ZACHO I think touch is huge. Umm… if you can't interact and communicate with the world around you, I believe there is innate human need for touch and compassion, so you can still rub someone’s arm, using a lotion that has a nice or an unusual scent. 

00:45:10
It smells nice, hasn't it? 

00:45:10
MADELINE MERCER Also try sensory stimulation have them squeeze a spongy rubber ball. Feel a silky scarf, touch scratchy sand paper, use a sound of a noise maker. 

00:45:35
Shake. Very good, thank you. 

00:45:35
MADELINE MERCER Strum a guitar, or rock in a comfy chair. In the final days, a person with A D will sleep most of the time. 

00:45:55
GAIL PETERSEN All of their bodily systems just shut down and they sleep away. For most people it’s a very peaceful death. 

00:46:00
KIM PETERSEN Its terribly difficult for the family to watch this decline, which is very slow. 

00:46:05
Advance Directive 

00:46:05
MADELINE MERCER Its vital to understand their advance medical directive, to respect their wishes and to care for them till the end. 

00:46:15
KIM PETERSEN The job of the caregiver can be… come very rewarding in providing comfort and quality of life, so they have the dignity to accept this world in a very best way that they can. 

00:46:30
Living With ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE SEVERE 

00:46:30
Jeanette Rouse 

00:46:30
PAUL ROUSE Yeah, I met you in Chicago on a blind date, yeah. I was worked at Amity school and I met you on a blind date. And when you left the house, you put out your arm, you said take a ring, and I did and hung on ever since, hadn't we? 

00:46:55
PAUL ROUSE Her older sister had Alzheimer’s and she has stayed in lot of place for sometime, a couple of weeks of that time. So, I knew just what the symptoms were and Jeanette used to say, you know I pray everyday and it and I always keep my mind, but it just didn't happen that way. So the last thing in the world I want to do was to put her in Healthcare Facility, but I knew that time would come and I would have to, no way that I can handle it on myself. Now that she is here and I’m very comfortable, I’m much more relaxed, I had lost quite a bit of weight. I guess I didn't realize that I was under stress, but I guess we all would and we don’t know it. Alright. Shall we do that again? Everyday when I come in, she still likes to hold my hands, she sometimes squeezes it real hard. Just relax. And do exercises like this uh? Well that's great, that's good. Uh…Huh… Likewise here it is. One time she took my hand, she wanted this she want to bite it, bite my finger and I said, Jeanette, why do you wanna bite my finger? She says because I love you. I thought that was real neat that made my day. That was a couple of years ago, she couldn't do that anymore. She was just sitting there and sleeping and she doesn’t respond, and then I say Jeanette, how do you like a bite of an orange Jeanette, here is a big bite. And I put some in her mouth and (inaudible ) she brings her head up then she would bites it. Something she likes, so she is… she is happy to do it. Would you like another bite of orange? 

00:48:40
JEANETTE ROUSE Yes, yes, yes. 

00:48:40
PAUL ROUSE Yeah. Okay. It seems to make her more alert. Big bite, yeah very good. I liked it. And always say to people join the support group because you can't go alone, you got to help, help need other people to help you out. If I know to take care of myself, I can I do a good job taking care of Jeanette. But the future holds for Jeanette and there are pathways in her brain getting more and more affected and then she is going to reach the point where there would be nothing but the brain stem left. She will no longer be able to eat, she will no longer be able to talk, she will no longer be able to breathe. Its not a case of getting better, nobody, no matter how much I imagine and pray and hope that it would, but it doesn't felt. We know that. Is that right, is it okay. I, I often wonder what is going on her head? 

00:49:40
JEANETTE ROUSE Yes, yes yes, yes. 

00:49:45
PAUL ROUSE Yeah! Isn't she able to communicate with herself or just what it is? You get tired? 

00:49:50
JEANETTE ROUSE Yeah. 

00:49:50
PAUL ROUSE How does a patient depress with Alzheimer’s feel, if they could how about they say. I just wrote this down, this is… this is… should the last paragraph of what it says here, I know there are times, but I seem to ignore you that's Alzheimer’s at work. I have no control. But we have the special bond between us and I know that you are with me and though I’ve been robbed of my remembering, I know you will always be here for me and never forget me. And… And I will… I will always love you. Your wife and sweetheart Jeanette.

What Every Caregiver Needs to Know About ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE CONCLUSION 

00:51:05
MADELINE MERCED People with A D live in a world of confusion, a world that is slipping away from them. Research promises exciting new treatments. And perhaps, one day this terrible disease will end. Until then, there is a great need for caregivers. Caregivers who understand this disease and want to help because people with A D deserve the best. 

00:51:40
KIM PETERSEN If we can help them in any way, have a quality of life and… and maintain personhood and… and their dignity, umm… that's an honor. And we could always learn something from each of our patients to make us better people. 

00:51:55
GAIL PETERSEN If you love older people and if you are good with people and if you are empathetic, this is the most well warming job you’ll ever do. 

00:52:05
JENNIFER JOHNSON I definitely think its a privilege to take care of patients at the end of their life or in the middle of their Dementia or that it had just start it’s times with their health and stuff, I think it’s the priviledge.
