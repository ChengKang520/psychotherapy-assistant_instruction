00:00:10
DR. CLIVE JONES Now, we've just finished looking at the first four stages of Erikson's Psychosocial Development. And now we're going to look at uh, we're going to emphasize the next three, even though there are another four stages, I want to particularly look at the next three. Overall, Erikson has eight stages. Uhm, we're paying particular attention to seven. And we've reached the fourth one, which we will review slightly as well. Uhm, so we're on to number five and number five is where we're looking at adolescence. And in adolescence we have what's called either identity or role confusion, so I'll just put that up. Identity versus role confusion. Now, all of these things actually develop on from each other. If a person is feeling inferior, guilty, mistrusting, shameful and doubtful about who they are and about the world around them, uh, you can see that it's going to continue to snowball on to the other negative side of the coin in these two polar opposites. And so in that context, if a child reaches adolescence and they're feeling ashamed about their autonomy, where they are inferior and guilty about their industry and initiative, where they're guilty about taking initiative, where they're feeling inferior about their industrious activity, they're going to sound a little confused about who they are, generally speaking. That's what Erikson proposes. And in that confusion can be a lot of anxiety. That's adolescence. It's very normal to be assessing their identity and re-evaluating any values that they might have had in childhood or any beliefs and attitudes and perspectives. It's very natural and normal. Now, if a, if an adolescent is, is failing that search for identity in the context of feeling ashamed and doubtful and guilty and mistrusting. If they're trying to find their identity in a context of that underlying stuff, it's going to be a very tumultuous and stressful time. They're not going to trust their own judgements. They're not going to trust the perspectives of others when they're considering who to believe, what to believe, why to believe it, how they're going to live their life, what direction they're going to take. It's just going to be a, a blurry, fog of confusion which ultimately in the end ambiguity is going to cause a lot of anxiety and stress for the adolescent. And how an adolescent might choose to react to that if they find themselves in that place, it can be quite destructive. There can be a whole lot of things that can be put into place to try, that an adolescent might try to use to ease the feelings of anxiety, ease the confusion. Uh, so anyway, the aim is here at this stage the adolescent is trying to form a sense of identity. If they've gone through a fair trusting of others generally. If they've gone through with a sense of feeling autonomous, and where they're establishing their industry and feel like they can accomplish things and do things and that their opinion does count and their point of view does matter, and their values and belief are important. If an adolescent starts to develop that sense, then they're going to be trusting, listening and dialoguing and debating the opinions of others. And then they're going to be also forming and shaping their sense of who they are in a very healthy and constructive way. But again, on the other side of the coin, if they're feeling shameful, doubtful, confused, uhm, inferior, then there's going to be anxiety, and again, that coupling of depression as well, potentially. A very depressing and anxious time if an adolescent is building on those negative foundations from the past. So you can see the impact here and uh, there's going to be varying intensities in regard to this as well, in all of those things. There are continuums of degrees, of which people conform to either extreme or any other area in between. All right, and so now we're looking at number six. And number six is young adulthood. And we're looking at intimacy versus isolation. 

00:04:50

00:04:55
DR. CLIVE JONES Now in regard to this uh, on the extreme end of isolation we can have, you know, social phobias. Uh, we can have individuals that are very anxious about any sort of intimate connection, uh, because of the fear of their own inadequacies as an individual, feeling inferior, feeling guilty, feeling ashamed of who they are. Then a person can start to fear connecting with others because of the potential consequences of that intimacy and so if a person is developing on this side of the coin, they're going to fear relationships and be scared of them, not want to connect and be intimate. If here, if a person establishes a sense of identity, well, then they're going to feel safer and more trusting in the context of a relationship. Relationships won't necessarily be a place that encourages anxiety. Relationships will be a place of support and encouragement and hope and fulfillment and satisfaction. And so in that sense, the psychosocial, the interpersonal relationships, that we develop can develop in a very positive way that can be quite therapeutic, or they can develop in a very negative way and be quite destructive and encourage those negative emotions within us. And so, this young adulthood phase of, of being able to establish intimate relationships in a safe and constructive and self-fulfilling and mutually fulfilling, uh, is quite important to abating the possibility of anxiety. That social support is considered one of the most predominant and enduring factors that help to ease anxiety and a lot of other mental health issues. Such a support is vital in the development of, of personal mental health, okay? When we can intimately connect with others. When we can feel safe and significant in the context of other people and in relationships. When we can really be who we are and when we know that who we are is going to be valued by the other person. When we trust the other person to genuinely have our best interests at heart, without negating their own concerns either, okay? When there is that mutual understanding and mutual gratification, mutual satisfaction and valuing, that's a healthy, constructive, intimate relationship where anxiety isn't going to really get a foothold in the context of that type of relationship. And if the person is able to establish those intimate connections with others at various levels with partners, with friends, with family, uhm, then you're going to find somebody who's really set themselves up to be in a very healthy place. And for sure, things might come up that will encourage anxiety, but wow, you know, that intimate social support is going to be a really constructive and healthy buffer to easing the impact for anxiety, big time. And so, intimacy or isolation is an important factor. And then go into the concept of uh, generativity, generativity versus stagnation. Now what happens here is that if a person is feeling intimate connections, that they're able to contribute to the lives of others and others can contribute to them, and there's a sense of mutual fulfillment and satisfaction, where a person doesn't feel threatened or ashamed of who they are, uhm, or, or inferior, there's going to be some pretty positive feelings going around in the context of those healthy, intersocial, interpersonal reltionships. And, the concept of generativity and stagnation is when a person in their adulthood life uh, where they're figuring that they're out to contribute significantly to the lives of others, so not only whereby they're not feeling ashamed of who they are, not feeling inferior, but actually feeling that they're able to contribute to the lives of others. It could be through taking on an apprentice. It could be through coaching a team. It could be through helping a friend through a tough time. It could be a whole range of things where we feel that we can put into the lives of, of other people. That's a sense of being generative. The other side of the coin is a stagnation where not only where we start to feel isolated, but we feel that our life isn't really contributing to others. Uhm, and a person in that sense can start to feel a sense of worthlessness and a sense of anxiety that comes from broader existential concerns of meaning and value of life. What's the whole point? And there are some times that could be a reason for what we would call, you know, in a layman's term a mid-life crisis. You know that concept of what's the whole point? Uhm, and that can encourage a lot of anxiety in, in an individual when they're facing this concept of generativity or stagnation. Uh, what does their life mean? Uh, what legacy are they going to leave behind in the lives of others. And so that is uh, an important element as well. And the concept of middle adulthood and areas of anxiety that stem from psychosocial or interpersonal relationships. Another area where anxiety could come about. Now let's very quickly light on the fourth one, which I was saying I wasn't going to look at very specifically but I will touch on it. It is an important thing as well. Integrity versus despair. And I've actually just thought of a, a case example with one of my clients in regard to this so I think I will spend a little bit of time on it, because it was a client who was facing the end of their life. They had chronic emphysema. They only had about six months to live. Uh, the doctor was uh, visiting in terms of a medical practitioner, was visiting uh, to keep them on medications relating to the emphysema, making sure that their lungs weren't getting infected and pneumonia kicking in as a secondary cause of concern. And in a sense trying to make her lifestyle as productive and as healthy as possible in the boundaries of her illness. I got a call from the uh, GP. It was a referral because she was, had generalized anxiety and panic attacks with agoraphobia. She did not want to leave the house and the medical practitioner came to realize that there were certain things in her environment that showed that she really wasn't getting out at all. And he started to get worried about that. And so I had to start making some house calls, originally, because she wasn't going out of the house at all. She was facing this integrity and despair and in that despair was a real fear of the fact that her life was completely pointless. After talking with her, she had gone through all of these stages: role confusion, inferiority, shame, doubt, stagnation. She had broken relationships with her family, with her siblings. Uh, she was in despair, but in that despair, she was so frightened and so scared that she decided she didn't want to go out of the house anymore and stuff up anymore. In her final six months of life, she thought, the safest place to be is in the house. She didn't want to cause any more grief, any more trouble. She didn't want to have any more grief, any more trouble. What was compounding it was that her family weren't responding to their acknowledgement of her impending death, which testified to her even more, her sense of isolation, her sense of stagnation whereby she wasn't generating into the life of her children, or she felt she wasn't. And as a result of that, she didn't feel a sense of integrity with her life. She was looking back on her life and thinking, basically, it was all pointless. And the strength of anxiety, the fear that she had about her own death, the fear that she had about her own life was very strong and powerful 00:13:30]to the point where she just didn't want to venture out anymore. Okay, so anyway, we did work through a process. We worked through-, and I won't go into the details of that now because that's going to be for another time later on in the process of what we're involving here in these videos. But what-, in the process, we worked through some of these things and ultimately in the last six months of her life, she ended up embracing the things that she did enjoy about life. And there was a quality of life that she was able to attain until her irreversible illness got the better of her and she did die about six or seven months after I started treating her. But her agoraphobia abated and her anxiety abated and as a result she was able to get out and about. One thing that she loved was Bingo at the local balls club. And so she finally started venturing out and getting involved in her Bingo, socially interacting with others again, embracing her life until the very end. She also started to reconnect with her family and her children, writing letters. Even-, a whole process started to take place in her last six months where she started to establish what she felt for the first time, a sense of integrity in her life, which abated the anxiety, which gave her a sense of purpose and meaning. And the fear of life started to ease as she started to feel that sense of integrity. And so you can see the importance of these areas and how they may contribute anywhere along the lifespan in regard to anxiety. And then how we deal with that as we unfold and discover what issues are causing the anxiety, how to then work with the client in terms of establishing healing from anxiety in the context of the issues that have caused it. We're going to be moving on to other areas of social, cultural and existential spiritual areas as well in the next aspect of the video.

Austrialian Institute of Professional Consellors Caring for people Humanistic Perspective on Anxiety 

00:15:40
DR. CLIVE JONES As well, I like to look at the positive side of the coin as a way of treatment and healing. Some might say that it has a solution focus in looking at the ideals in what a person can become and to reaching one's full potential. And pragmatically looking at what that means for the individual. And so you can see there that cross link in the positive aspects of relationships and living that Erikson looked at, the positive and the negative. And also now what humanists in the terms of Carl Rogers and others looked at. One thing that Carl Rogers looked at in particular was again the concept that he called the conflicts between the real self, the ought self and the ideal self. Now, in a sense, he saw that uh, that was moving from the concept of conflicts with the ego and the superego when he talked about the ought self and the real self. Different terminology but looking at similar patterns of intra-psychic stuff or intrapersonal stuff. But then also how it's influenced in the context of interpersonal relationships. what Rogers suggested was that we can often get a lot of anxiety building up when we have the ought self in conflict with the reality of who we really are, our real self. We've got our ought self, the ought to, what we ought to do, how we ought to be, what we ought to do in regard to others, in regard to work. And then there's the real self of who we really are. Rogers suggests that the greater the chasm between those two, the greater the levels of anxiety we will feel, where we get this tension within us of who we ought to be, what we ought to do, and the reality of who we want to be and what we want to do. And again this develops out of the context of interpersonal relationships, expectations of significant others and then we also get into the broader socio-cultural element as well in terms of expectations about the ought self, who we ought to be. This can cause a significant level of anxiety and Rogers treated a number of people from this premise of understanding with great success. That we need to understand that there could be some significant conflict between who a person sees themselves as being and who they think others believe they should be and the tension and pressure that can come of that. Gestalt is another therapeutic perspective, and it's moving on from that again. It's building on that concept of Rogers and suggesting that in the context of trying to succumb to the needs of the ought self we develop a phony layer and it's in the context of living in that phony layer where we are living and functioning in the context of who we think we ought to be in relation to others that that's when we start to feel anxious when we start to get too phony and we start to see that chasm between our phoniness and we start to feel a void and a loss of connection with who we really are. And you can see how that ties in with Erikson's understanding of identity formation. If we're feeling ashamed of who we are, inferior and, and uhm, concerned about how we present to others, then we're not going to establish a sense of identity. And as a result of that, Erikson called it role confusion and Gestalt therapists call that our phony layer, where we've got a phoniness about us, where we're not really presenting the real self because we feel ashamed of it. We feel inferior and we feel that who we are is not appropriate. And so that can build a lot of anxiety whereby we don't necessarily have a clear understanding of who we are. That anxiety develops when we start to realize how phony we might be from a Gestalt perspective and where we start to feel quite anxious when we lose sight of ourselves in the context of acknowledging that phoniness. Where we start to feel, my goodness, that's not who I am. That's not what I really think. That's not what I really feel or believe. And we start to think I've just been playing a game for too long. I was treating a mom of two kids in a happy family with a husband, and the husband-, you can see how that ties in with Erikson's understanding of identity formation. If we're feeling ashamed of who we are, inferior and, and uhm, concerned about how we present to others, then we're not going to establish a sense of identity. And as a result of that, Erikson called it role confusion and Gestalt therapists call that our phony layer, where we've got a phoniness about us, where we're not really presenting the real self because we feel ashamed of it. We feel inferior and we feel that who we are is not appropriate. And so that can build a lot of anxiety whereby we don't necessarily have a clear understanding of who we are. That anxiety develops when we start to realize how phony we might be from a Gestalt perspective and where we start to feel quite anxious when we lose sight of ourselves in the context of acknowledging that phoniness. Where we start to feel, my goodness, that's not who I am. That's not what I really think. That's not what I really feel or believe. And we start to think I've just been playing a game for too long. I was treating a mom of two kids in a happy family with a husband, and the husband was getting confused with the growing level of anxiety that his wife was facing. And she was getting confused with it too. And it was really quite interesting when she shared her story about the anxiety. The continual thing that she kept on saying, and she wasn't trained in a Gestalt perspective at all, but she just kept on saying to me, I just feel so phony. I just feel I've been living a lie. I just feel that I have been doing everything that I thought I had to do for the sake of everybody else and I just have lost any sense of who I am. And she said very clearly, that scares me so much. I don't know who I am. I'm just one big phony. And when she was confronted with that, the degree and level of anxiety and fear and panic, when she was hit with that perspective, that's what made her panic. That's what evoked that biological response within her. And she said that she would feel it in times when she was being the most phony. For example, when she was at a parent teacher night, she was saying that uhm, she just was hit with this perspective of being phony. That the way she was talking with others and the way that she even dressed and prepared for the night, she got hit with this perspective of, that's not who I am. That's not how I would normally dress. That's not how I would normally talk. And when she was hit with that, she had this biological response, the fear, where the adrenaline started rushing, the heart started palpitating, and in the context of that biology and in that reaction, she wanted to just run away from the room. She just wanted to escape and get away as fast as she could from that environment because it threatened her so much, because she was confronted with what she said was her phoniness. In her own words that's what she said. And so, it was a journey of her discovering who she really was, you know, peeling back the layers and coming to understand exactly who she was. Now it's interesting, her biological response wasn't just palpitations. There were palpitations. She was losing her breath. It was a real feeling of panic. She was thinking she was going to die of a heart attack, one of those things would happen, which is very common for panic attacks. And then also that wanting to run out of the room. But another thing that she felt too, which can happen with anxiety, it's a natural genetic response of just wanting to drop everything that's going to interfere with us getting away. So if we're in the middle of digesting something, we need all of the blood to deal with the threat. Then what happens is if we will unload our bowels and our bladder in order to have ourself free from any other biological distractions so that all of our energy can be put into dealing with the threat. So as a result of that, sometimes when people are in a state of panic, their bowels will start to play up and they'll just want to go to the toilet and that's one of, was one of her reactions. When she was having the anxiety, she just got diarrhea. And so, it wasn't only that she wanted to just run out and escape from the room, but if she didn't, she would get this growing sense of just wanting to go to the toilet which made her wanting to run out of the room even more. And so she was always in this predicament. Wherever she faced situations where she thought she had to put on a bit of an act, she got very anxious and stressed out about it whereby she wanted to run out and go to the toilet. And it's something that really worried her deeply. So that's the various humanistic perspectives on dealing with our, our phoniness or our lack of identity or our ought to self. And in the context of interpersonal relationships, expectations of others and the pressure we put on ourselves and then the anxiety that results from that. So that's, that's where the humanistic perspective comes in. And a guide looks at the positive whereby a humanistic perspective would encourage a person to find out who they really are and then in the context of who they really are with, with, with the proper unconditional regard and respect and congruence, uhm, of, of being who they really are, they can find their full potential and find a better satisfaction or, or more satisfaction in life in the context of not being phony. But anyway, that's, that's a humanistic perspective on anxiety and we're going to now look at uhm, other areas in that model as well.

00:26:20
DR. CLIVE JONES What we're going to look at now in the integrated model is uhm, the existential and spiritual components of those things that can influence your growth and development and which ultimately can play a part in uh, our state of anxiety as well. In regard to existential concerns, uh, there's a number of theorists and therapists that would encourage clients to examine the concept of meaning and purpose and deeper values that are held in the context of life in general. I can remember uhm, one client that came to me with uhm, generalized anxiety disorder to put a label on it. And he was feeling very anxious and concerned on a daily basis to the point where it was inhibiting him from showing up at work. He had to have sick days as a result of it and it was preoccupying his mind as well in regard to the intense feelings that he had. Now when he started to communicate and share his concerns and the base of what he felt the anxiety was stemming from. He shared his story. He said he was uh, going to work on a bus and he looked around. And he said he couldn't understand why everybody could just sit there and carry on as if life is okay and that there is a conception between everyone sitting on the bus that life is just going to go on and it's not eventually going to stop. He said that he'd be sitting there thinking, one day I'm going to die. One day, all of us sitting in this bus will be dead. And he said that thought would evoke within him so much anxiety. And he was also wondering why he would start to think about that. Now, in regard to him coping with his own father's death and being faced with the hard-core reality that life does come to an end, uhm, when he shared about the relationship he had with his father and so forth. In the context of that existential concern, as a result of working through the grief with his father's death. There was this ongoing chronic anxiety that remained over the, the preceding 16 or 17 years. So when he ended up back in the counseling room, there were these unanswered existential concerns that he was worried about in regard to the whole concept of death and non-being and existential therapists would suggest that sometimes anxiety can be evoked by the thought of the fact that one day we are not going to be on this earth anymore. And that can encourage within us a deep sense of anxiety. If we go back to the concept of anxiety being the response to a threat, what bigger threat to us than our own death? And so in the idea of conceptualizing and being faced with that in some way, it is no wonder that existential concerns of life and death and the concept of not being on the planet anymore uhm, non-being, it can be a place that can evoke some serious anxiety. And often, in terms of when I supervise counselors and psychotherapists, some counselors can get concerned or worried about talking through those things with a client because it might evoke within themselves their own fears and anxieties over death and non-being. And so in that sense there can be quite a need for, for uhm, supervision in all cases, obviously ongoing supervision is important, but I've just found personally in supervising counselors that when faced with death, when faced with the anxious concerns of death, uh, how we choose to encourage clients to work through them sometimes could be prompted by our own fears and anxieties in thinking about them. And so we have to be careful and proceed with caution that we don't uhm, stumble into trying to fix our own anxieties in the context of leading a client through their own understanding. Now he ended up saying that it went further than that in terms of the concept of death and non-being for this client with his chronic generalized anxiety. He was tired of taking the medications and was wanting to really try to get to the heart of it. And he said that another thing that concerned him, he started to get this very clear picture and perception of being a little speck on a ball that spins around and that ball that's spinning around is a little speck in this big, black, dark space. Now, he was in one way just stating some facts in terms of the universe, and the galaxy and how planets are placed, and our literal size in the context of the very vast universe, very big planets. But he was relaying it in a way that caused him anxiety and fear. And the way he communicated was that it scared him that his life seemed to feel so insignificant and with such pointlessness that for him it scared him and concerned him deeply. That sense of meaninglessness and pointlessness. So you can see that sometimes anxiety can be evoked by those sorts of concerns. Now those concerns can stem from a whole range of interactions that we've had in the past from environmental experiences we've had from people dying or from a whole range of variables that could come to have us thinking about those things. But ultimately, I can say again, that it's fair enough to consider it an ultimate concern as existential therapists would say. It is an ultimate concern of the whole of humanity, our concept of death and non-being. So existential therapy is looking at anxiety from that point of view and it's very effective in encouraging clients through the processes involved in existential therapy encouraging clients through their existential and spiritual base concerns. And in the context of that obviously, there is going to be issues of, of uhm, religious beliefs, concepts of whether there is life after death or not and so it comes into a whole spiritual realm. And at that point, that's where we also now move onto the social and cultural elements of, of anxiety. The whole concept of how society in general looks at life and views life and how a society deals with life, that encourages the individual to view and deal with life in the same way. And so, a lot of folks with existential concerns and the human rights with existential concerns of, of non-being and death and the meaning and purpose of life, uh, will often have answers within a context of culture. And so uh, how well those cultural variables answer those questions for the client uh, how well connected the client is to their culture, how much they agree with the cultural roles and morays and norms, uhm, religious beliefs that are immersed and wrapped in the culture, that can also have an impact and an influence on the anxiety state of an individual. We can also move more into the social and political aspects of influence as well. Uhm, modern cultural counseling as I was saying before is a big area that's increased in interest over the last 10 to 15 years in particular. And in the context of that, it'slooking at counseling in psychotherapy having a social responsibility and where there are social injustices, that is going to cause anxiety and other forms of ill mental health. Poverty, suppression, excessive rule and aggressive rule. There's a whole range of things, war, high crime rates, feeling vulnerable in society. All of those things can play a part in encouraging a person to feel anxious as well and need to be considered in the counseling process. Okay, we've just gone through the process of reviewing in detail the internal factors of influence on personality and the potential resulting state of anxiety. The internal factors in this box. And we've also looked at the outside factors on the outside of the individual represented by this circle. We've looked at the outside factors that have influence as well. And pressing in on, in terms of influencing personality and influencing the state of being in regard to anxiety. And so one thing that we've touched on at different points in time is cognitions, behaviors and emotions. But in a sense those three things, of cognitions, behaviors and emotions spin around in the context of the pressures and forces of the internal and the external. And it's at this point really in the thoughts, the feelings and behaviors where we see who the person is. Those aspects are the most overt, and they're the things that we can clearly communicate about and see. But the whole idea of counseling and psychotherapy is to make those links of cognitions, behaviors and emotions have a link to each other but also have a link to the internal forces and the external forces of influence. Now in terms of the psychotherapeutic process, in terms of counseling strategy and skill, the aim is to use these overt areas of thought, feeling and behaviors to influence in a way the decline as complete control over and whereby they are a part in shaping and forming the process apart. But where thoughts, feelings and behaviors are considered and assessed and reviewed in terms of how they're being influenced by these internal factors and these external factors, and then ultimately what the client is then aiming to do about it in a positive and constructive way. Because the ultimate goal in counseling and psychotherapy is that the thoughts and the feelings and the behaviors are appropriate and constructive and positive. That's going to lead to optimum mental health. I'll say that again, that the thoughts, the feelings and the behaviors or the cognitions, emotions and behaviors are functioning in a way that is going to be healthy and productive for the sake of the individual and also for the society. When relationships can be healthy and constructive, that's the aim. And it's looking at how these factors influence that in either a positive or negative way. And when I say positive, I don't necessarily mean emotions that are always feeling good because sometimes it would be appropriate to have anxiety. Sometimes it's appropriate to feel down. Sometimes it's appropriate to have one weak or negative emotions. And so it's looking for the relevance of particular thoughts, feelings and behaviors in the context of the internal issues and in the context of the external issues. What we're going to be doing next up in following videos is looking at strategies of approach, particular strategies of approach, again integrated approach. We're going to look at different ways of working with clients in regard to the areas of influence. The internal areas and the outside external areas on cognitions, emotions and behaviors. So we'll be looking at that next time through case examples.
