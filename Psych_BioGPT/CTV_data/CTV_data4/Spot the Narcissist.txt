Spot the Narcissist Presented by Richard Hill 

00:00:00
Introduction AIPC Lecture Series Spot the Narcissist 

00:00:25
RICHARD HILL Hi. I'm Richard Hill and the purpose of this video is to help you spot the narcissists in either your life or the lives of your clients affected by the disorder. Over the next 30 minutes we'll be looking at what symptoms characterize narcissism, how the disorder gets going in the first place, and why we often let narcissists get away with their behavior. The consequences of someone acting narcissistically are huge. We explore those and also a few survival tips for dealing with a narcissist. You've probably heard about narcissism, but you might be uncertain as to exactly what we mean when we say that someone is a narcissist or has a narcissistic streak. So, to get going on our spot the narcissist quest I'd like you to imagine for a moment that you're at a gathering, a party to which many famous and beautiful people have been invited. You're new in town and you don't know anyone present so your job is to circulate throughout the party talking to different people and trying to work out which guests you might like to get to know better. You've been warned not to get too involved with any narcissists so you're trying very hard to discern who is self-absorbed and who is not. So you grab a glass of champagne off the waiter and notice that an expensively dressed gentleman with a large diamond ring is doing the same. You begin to chat as you sip. He's quick to complain about the caliber of the champagne being served. "Only the French one is any good," he laments. "We surely deserve better than this home grown stuff." He goes on to assure you that he has bothered to come in a custom made suit from a designer company and has made a real effort to put aside his busy schedule to get here so it's fair to expect the best. He looks around distractedly as he talks to you. He wants, he says, to make sure the promised A-listers do actually arrive as he's planning to have his photo taken with several of the celebs coming. He begins telling you about his many achievements and many minutes later he pauses and reflects, "Well, I guess that's enough about me. Let's talk about you. Tell me, what do you think of me?" Well, feigning desperation for the hors d'oeuvres you start heading for the opposite corner of the venue and on route your elbow is gently grabbed by an exceedingly attractive person of the opposite sex. Beautifully centered, coffered and dressed in haute couture the person smiles alluringly. "Hey, where are you going in such a hurry?" The voice is seductive. The eyes are bedroom eyes if you ever saw them. "Slow down and let's get to know each other," the person insists. You can feel yourself being drawn in by the charm until you remind yourself of why you are there. Although the person seems totally taken in by you, hairs go up on the back of your neck, you plan your escape. Deciding not to engage so directly this time you sidle up to a group congregated around a woman talking. You realize that she's one of the celebrities, the A-listers invited. She has a group of earnest people standing around here all apparently riveted by her declaration that she's finished with beauty pageants forever. Now she just wants to do the ecology thing. She speaks animatedly about her starring role in the recent push to stop shark fins from ending up in Asian soups and her voice lowers conspiratorially as she adds in how many Asian authorities are after her in the wake of her success of stopping fisherman from cutting off the fins and throwing the slowly dying shark back into the ocean. She seems amazing, very credible. She has vast, far reaching plans to extend what she says and power and prominence. You're curious, but with her too you wonder , is this all just a front for being able to grab the limelight? You leave the party a little later feeling drained. In fact, you've just met three narcissists of the elitist, amorist, and the fanatic types and there are said to be, there are said to be several other types as well...we're sort of getting ahead of ourselves. Let's look at how we define this deadly to relationships disorder. 

00:05:05
The definition AIPC Lecture Series Spot the Narcissist 

00:05:10
[sil.] 

00:05:10
Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) 

00:05:10
RICHARD HILL In Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) individuals have an inflated sense of their own importance and a deep need for admiration whether they have done anything to be admired for or not. A person with NPD is preoccupied with issues of power, personal adequacy, prestige, and vanity. Such a person lacks empathy and exudes a sense of superiority, but beneath the mask of super confidence rests an extremely fragile self esteem. Individuals with NPD are insensitive to others feelings, but crumple at the slightest hint of criticism to themselves. Heinz Kohut first called it narcissism in 1968. It was called megalomania before then. In talking today about narcissism we mean pathological narcissism as opposed to a healthy kind of self love that some authors refer to as healthy narcissism. 

00:06:10

00:06:10
Symptoms AIPC Lecture Series Spot the Narcissist 

00:06:10
RICHARD HILL So, what you ask, are the symptoms? Believe me you saw some at the party we were just describing. The diagnostics and statistics manual doctors use to diagnose illnesses called the DSM talks about NPD as a pervasive pattern of grandiosity in fantasy or behavior. Pervasive here means that the grandiosity is spread throughout the personality along with a need for admiration and lack of empathy. The symptoms begin by early adulthood and we can see in a number of ways, we can see this in a number of ways. I'd like to take a moment or two now to go over these symptoms with you. But to make the formal DSM speak a little bit more user friendly I'll also say a sentence for each symptom which is a bit of a translation of how that symptom or characteristic would seem from the point of view of the narcissist themselves. A person would have to show about five of these in order to be deemed to have NPD. 

00:07:10
Symptom #1: The narcissist has a grandiose sense of self-importance, exaggerating achievements and skills and expecting to be recognised as superior without commensurate achievements. 

00:07:10
RICHARD HILL So one, symptom number one. The narcissist has a grandiose sense of self-importance, exaggerating achievements and skills and expecting to be recognised as superior without commensurate achievements. 

00:07:25
The narcissist sees this as: "It is amazing how difficult it is for some people to appreciate my creativity." 

00:07:25
RICHARD HILL The narcissist might see this as, "it is amazing how difficult it is for some people to appreciate my creativity." 

00:07:30
Symptom #2: The narcissist is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love. 

00:07:35
RICHARD HILL Symptom number two. The narcissist is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love. 

00:07:45
This translates to the narcissist's view that: "I often find myself thinking about the long-overdue admiration which will come my way when my talents and special qualities are fully recognised." 

00:07:45
RICHARD HILL This might translate into the narcissist's view as, "I often find myself thinking about the long-overdue admiration which will come my way when my talents and special qualities are finally fully recognised." 

00:07:55
Symptom #3: The narcissist believes that he or she is "special" and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other high-status people (or institutions). 

00:08:00
RICHARD HILL Symptom number three. The narcissist believes that he or she is "special" and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other high-status people for instructions. 

00:08:10
This translates to: "I will only accept service from the top person (doctor, lawyer, hairdresser, secretary) in the field." 

00:08:15
RICHARD HILL Well, translation... : "I will only accept service from the top person (doctor, lawyer, hairdresser, secretary) in the field." 

00:08:20
Symptom #4: The narcissist requires excessive admiration. 

00:08:25
RICHARD HILL Symptom number four. The narcissist requires excessive admiration. 

00:08:25
From the narcissist's side: "Other people's shortcomings make it hard for them to give me the compliments and attention that are due me." 

00:08:30
RICHARD HILL The narcissist might think, "other people's shortcomings make it hard for them to give me the compliments and attention that are due me." 

00:08:35
Symptom #5: The narcissist has a sense of entitlement, i.e., unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations. 

00:08:40
RICHARD HILL Symptom number five. The narcissist has a sense of entitlement. There is an unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations. 

00:08:50
And the narcissist: "I really get irritated when others fail to assist me in my very important work." 

00:08:50
RICHARD HILL The narcissist might feel, "I really get irritated when others fail to assist me in my very important work." 

00:09:00
Symptom #6: The narcissist is interpersonally exploitative, i.e., takes advantage of others to achieve his or her ends. 

00:09:00
RICHARD HILL Symptom number six. The narcissist is interpersonally exploitative. That is takes advantage of others to achieve his or her ends. 

00:09:10
From the narcissist's side: "If necessary, I will step on a few toes to make sure I get the special treatment I deserve." 

00:09:10
RICHARD HILL "If necessary, I will step on a few toes to make sure I get the special treatment I deserve." 

00:09:15
Symptom #7: The narcissist lacks empathy; is unwilling to recognise or identify with the feelings and needs of others. 

00:09:20
RICHARD HILL Symptom seven. The narcissist lacks empathy; is unwilling to recognise or identify with the feelings and needs of others . 

00:09:25
Translation: "People close to me tend to wallow around in their troubles, and I shouldn't be expected to waste my time listening to them." 

00:09:30
RICHARD HILL Translated into narcissist speak: "Please, those people close to me tend to wallow around in their troubles, and I shouldn't be expected to waste my time listening to them." 

00:09:40
Symptom #8: The narcissist is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her. 

00:09:45
RICHARD HILL Symptom number eight. The narcissist is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her. 

00:09:50
The narcissist's view: "When someone I know is praised, I spend a lot of time thinking about how much more I deserve it." 

00:09:50
RICHARD HILL In t he narcissist's view: "When someone I know is praised, I spend a lot of time thinking about how much more I deserve that praise." 

00:10:00
Symptom #9: The narcissist shows arrogant, haughty behaviours or attitudes. 

00:10:05
RICHARD HILL Symptom number nine. The narcissist shows arrogant, haughty behaviours or attitudes. 

00:10:05
The narcissist says: "I deserve the very best of everything." 

00:10:10
RICHARD HILL As the narcissist might say, "I deserve the very best of everything." So, are bells going off in your brain? I bet that suddenly you understand what was going on with that guy in your jogging club or your Auntie Mirabella or that teacher no one liked at Uni. The most important definition, almost a major symptom of NPD is simply this...it is a failure of relationship. Narcissist are not in relationship with themselves. They swing between the extremes of grandiosity on the one hand and vulnerability on the other. They never manage to stand in the center at right valuation of themselves so they cannot be truly in relationship with you. Sadly the charm and goodness, goodness knows they're charming, it's all a veneer. It doesn't go very deep. Let's have a look at how this sad psychological disorder gets going and what psychologists call an aetiology. 

00:11:10
[sil.] 

00:11:10
Aetiology: How do we create a narcissist? AIPC Lecture Series Spot the Narcissist 

00:11:15
RICHARD HILL So, how do we create a narcissist? As irritating as the disorder is, if you're dealing with a narcissist somewhere in your life and really, who isn't, the news is not straightforward on how the disorder begins to happen in a person's personality. Some experts such as the Mayo Clinic, note how complex the disorder is and the genetics or psychobiology might play a role in the development of NPD. Theorists like Lorna Benjamin argue however that despite not knowing the precise route through which a person comes to be a narcissist we can identify risk factors, childhood development factors and parenting habits that may contribute to the disorder. Many of these have to do with insecure or problematic attachments. Narcissists often experience extreme parenting behaviors such as excessive admiration that is not balanced by realistic feedback. Being valued by parents as a way of propping up their own self esteem or learning manipulative behaviors from parents when still young. In fact many narcissists have had a steady dose of both sides of extreme parenting, both extreme, unrealistic praise and also neglect or emotional abuse. Both excessive indulgences by caregivers and also unreliable care giving. Benjamin notes that three chief features of a narcissists developmental history specifically account for all nine of the NPD system we mentioned. 

00:12:45
"Selfless", noncontingent love 

00:12:50
RICHARD HILL Selfishness, nonconditioned, noncontingent love. By noncontingent, Benjamin means love given without a realistic base for what is ascribed to the child and adoration, meaning without any disclosure or parental feelings or needs which Benjamin says accounts for these symptoms. 

00:13:05
Grandiosity Fantasies of unlimited success The need to associate with people of high status Constant attention- and admiration-seeking Arrogance Lack of empathy 

00:13:10
RICHARD HILL Symptoms of grandiosity, fantasies of unlimited success, the need to associate with people of high status, constant attention and admiration seeking, arrogance, and lack of empathy. So called selfless, noncontingent love is really about parents reviving their long lost narcissistic dreams and trying to live them through their children. Such children are given everything so that they will not experience the constraints of reality which burst the bubble of the parents dreams. Such kids may be praised all the time. Not only as a result of hard work, they may be shielded from the reality that some people will not like them no matter what they do. Instead, they get a regular diet of false glory which they get hooked on and relationships become a way of getting another fix of this. 

00:14:05
Submissive Nurturance 

00:14:05
RICHARD HILL The second feature is submissive nurturance. This claims that the kid is consistently differential and nurturing to the NPD to be. Let us take the example of the adoring grandparents for whom the sky's the limit. In their desire to give love, Nana and Papa end up giving spectacular goodies perhaps well more than they can afford and making over the top allowances which the child expects to go higher, more anyone else, and continue getting. The symptoms of exploitation of others and entitlement can soon follow. 

00:14:40
The caregiver's disappointment with any evidence of "imperfection" 

00:14:45
RICHARD HILL The third developmental feature is that of the caregiver's disappointment with any evidence of imperfection. Which sets up the person for symptoms of envy and haughtiness. This feature entails children being unrealistically exalted as brilliant or successful without just cause, but then equally harshly and unjustly being criticized for having normal human fallibility, the baby that cries to make its needs known when it cannot yet talk for instance. Normal parents understand that babies cry and soil their nappies, they sort out the children needs. The parent breeding a narcissist can mostly get frustrated with this flaw on the part of the baby.

00:15:30
Consequences of narcissism AIPC Lecture Series Spot the Narcissist 

00:15:35
RICHARD HILL So, what can you expect if you're dealing with a narcissist? Unfortunately the news is not good. Experts identify aggression, distortions in thinking, impaired relationships, both externalized and internalized behaviors and insight deficits. So, we'll look at those. 

00:15:55
Aggression 

00:15:55
RICHARD HILL Aggression arises when the narcissist is criticized or experiences a threat to self esteem. Responses can include disdain and contempt, argumentativeness, anger and violent behavior. One of the more frequently studied social behaviors predicted by narcissism is aggression. 

00:16:10
Self-enhancement and distortions in thinking 

00:16:15
RICHARD HILL Self-enhancement and distortions in thinking. It's been confirmed narcissists have a tendency to take personal credit for success but blame others for failure. Narcissism also predicts the better than average effect by which researchers mean that narcissists will tend to report that they are better than average; good looking or intelligent or capable. Narcissists are often prone to the cognitive distortion of overconfidence, of overestimating their knowledge and failing to learn from errors and criticism. 

00:16:50
Impaired relationships 

00:16:55
RICHARD HILL Impaired relationships. Probably nowhere are the consequences of narcissism more devastating than in interpersonal relationships. It's not just that the NPD's entitlement and lack of empathy make genuine relationship difficult, for the narcissist it's a double whammy. Researchers have shown that in general narcissists are perceived more positively upon first mating than non-narcissists are. Over time however, the manipulations, the self-centeredness, the infidelity and other narcissistic behaviors bring the relationship down. And it falls further than it would a relationship with a non-narcissist because it starts from a greater height, the narcissists initially greater charm and likeability. The relational problems are distressing for the NPD and also for all those associated with them. 

00:17:50
Externalising behaviours 

00:17:55
RICHARD HILL Externalising behaviours. Pathological narcissism is shown to be directly relevant to compulsive gambling, alcohol use, compulsive spending, and anti-social behavior. The compulsive spending ties in with the NPDs traits of envy and desire and nothing but the best and they wish to be admired usually by having the latest material advantages. 

00:18:20
Internalising behaviours 

00:18:20
RICHARD HILL Internalising behaviors. Narcissism is linked with anxiety and depression mostly through impairment of the person's capacity to function in life. It may happen that the narcissists failure over time in domains such as work, intimate relationships and the social scene ushers in psychological distress leading to anxiety and depression. Narcissism is also related to suicidal behavior. 

00:18:50
Deficits in insight 

00:18:50
RICHARD HILL Deficits in insight. People diagnosed with NPD are shown in research studies not to be able to perceive either themselves or others with much depth or accuracy. It would seem that narcissistic individuals overriding self-centeredness causes them to miss cues about what is going on. 

00:19:15

00:19:15
Why narcissists get away with it AIPC Lecture Series Spot the Narcissist 

00:19:20
RICHARD HILL So we might ask, how is it that narcissists manage to get away with so much really bad behavior? Why don't we stop them? Well, those with experience dealing with narcissism already know the answer. The narcissist is just so jolly seductive. They're charming, savvy, great story tellers. Well, they have to be because they're often telling things that aren't true. They appear to be highly credible, accounsumently(ph) able to cover their tracks and they're among the greatest actors in the world. Added to that is the problem that most of the time we know that these behaviors work relationally for some time anyway while someone's still caught in the narcissists web because of the anchor in the other person. That is for every opportunity, opportunistic, manipulative, exploitative narcissist there is a self-defeating person. The one taking all the blame, agreeing that they are in the wrong and humbly deferring to everything and anything the NPD asserts or requests. Hopefully the self-defeating person does not describe you, but it brings us to the last area we must cover for you before we go. How do you actually deal with a narcissist? We're talking about psychological survival, they're both specific therapeutic answers. What do you do if you're a therapists in a session with a narcissists and the generalized useful skills and tips for anyone that happens to wonder into a narcissists fear. It's not possible to fully describe the appropriate therapeutic responses in this short video, but for that we urge you to sign up to the mental health academy's course on narcissism or particularly treating narcissism in and around your clients. Really good course. 

00:21:15
www.mentalhealthacademy.com.au 

00:21:15
RICHARD HILL But today, we would like to look at the new skill sets that you or any client dealing with a narcissist that you need to develop and also some survival tips. Let's look at some skill sets. 

00:21:30
[sil.] 

00:21:30
Survival tips for dealing with narcissists AIPC Lecture Series Spot the Narcissist 

00:21:30
Developing new skill sets 

00:21:35
RICHARD HILL Developing new skill sets. Most people, especially those with self defeating traits can benefit from skills training in order to be a match for the clever, aggressively, opportunistic narcissist. Some of the interpersonal skills that should seriously be considered are those around... 

00:21:55
Assertiveness Negotiating skills Communication skills Conflict management Coping with difficult people 

00:22:00
RICHARD HILL ...assertiveness, negotiating skills, communication skills, conflict management, and coping with difficult people. In session you would want to identify when a client, let's say it's a woman, is not stepping up to the plate to receive her just due and then working with feelings of guilt, shame, or unworthiness to claim it. A self-defeater in relationship with a narcissist always has the disadvantage of being made to feel less than, less deserving, less worthy to reserve entitlements and very much more the victim. The therapeutic work may usefully go back to childhood roots to look for the problem and almost certainly will explore how the person does relationship generally with herself as well as others. In cases of intractable full blown narcissism, your client may ultimately decide there is no hope in the relationship and in this case will need to have her capacity for leaving and being alone strengthened. 

00:23:05
Quick tips for survival 

00:23:05
RICHARD HILL Quick tips for survival. The above skills, well they took a bit of time to develop...let us close with some quick tips for survival, you know, for the short and medium term. Here are some strategies and some action points. I find myself in a bit of a quandary here as to, you know, use of he and she in the following descriptions, but as up to 75% of narcissists are thought to be male we will refer to the client as she and the narcissist as he. Of course both clients and narcissists come in both genders. Anyway, I just want you to allow for that. So here we are, quick tips. 

00:23:50
Get support 

00:23:50
RICHARD HILL Get support. Have your client build up her support networks. It's wonderful that she's come to see you. She should be encouraged to come for regular sessions working to the context described above. It's also imperative for her to develop strong social support links with family, friends, group members, colleagues, and others. Their perspectives may be useful to get a reality check on early warning signals if she continues to be abused. 

00:24:15
Find out how bad it is 

00:24:20
RICHARD HILL Find out how bad it is. Narcissists can come in all intensities, from a few tendencies in the narcissistic direction to having narcissistic traits or defenders to having a full disorder. Some people may only be acting that way because of some trauma, some other issues. Your client can work with you to discern just how serious the narcissist condition is. He should be going to the therapy too, but typically won't see anything wrong and that merits any attendance in the session and well, that can be a deal breaker for your client. 

00:24:55
Set boundaries 

00:25:00
RICHARD HILL Set boundaries. Remind your client that narcissists always believe through the entitlements and grandiosity that their needs are more important than others. The narcissist may expect her to drop whatever she's doing to be at his beck and call and be equally imposing on her space and time and resources, financial and otherwise. Help your client to make clear boundary statements about what she will and will not do and what he may and may not do. He needs to know the consequences of pushing those boundaries. 

00:25:30
Keep the promise made 

00:25:30
RICHARD HILL Keep the promises made. Establishing the limits is only half the battle, your client must learn to be consistent and maintain them. Drawing a line in the sand is just a challenge to a narcissist. He wants to see how he can cross it, testing the boundaries, how often. If your client says that she will go without him if he is late, she needs to keep that promise. 

00:25:55
Keep cool 

00:26:00
RICHARD HILL Keep cool. Calm confrontation with narcissists works much better than getting visibly upset because the latter response can see things escalate. Narcissists are good at pushing buttons and usually incapable of believing that they're the one that who done it and that there's anything wrong them. So your clients anger will just provide ammunition for the narcissist. Calm is better. 

00:26:20
Trust feelings 

00:26:25
RICHARD HILL Trust feelings. If the narcissist is telling your client something and your clients inside are churning for no logical reason, your client needs to learn to take a step back and evaluate the situation. Even if what she's being told seems quite reasonable, recall the point we know about NPDs being very credible. 

00:26:45
Don't get caught up in the drama 

00:26:45
RICHARD HILL Don't get caught up in the drama. Narcissists love theater and turn most things into a drama. That may be the NPDs choice, but ask your client if she wants to have her whole life embroiled in the narcissists various dramatic creations. Remind her that allowing herself to get caught in this way is a way of allowing the narcissist to control and manipulate her. Even trying to make progress in therapy, say couples therapy, can be a way of gaining attention and control. 

00:27:15
Lower expectations 

00:27:20
RICHARD HILL Lower expectations. Without being disparaging, ask your client to recognize that most narcissists find it very difficult to change. As far as they're concerned, they're fine the way they are. Setting boundaries and following through on consequences may cause the narcissist to change some behavior, but he will be doing it because it's beneficial to him, not necessarily for the client or for the partner. Appealing to his empathy or higher nature will not generally be successful. The earlier your client can recognize that, the better. 

00:27:55
Evaluate the relationship 

00:27:55
RICHARD HILL Evaluate the relationship. Encourage your client to probe with you into why she got into the relationship and what needs she believes its fulfilling. Was it a way for her to distract, punish, or ignore herself? What has kept her with someone so self involved and what else could she be doing with her time, money, and love? What is all the drama replacing? Remind her that while relationships do require work, they shouldn't hurt. For her to feel abused and completely unappreciated is just wrong. 

00:28:30
Do not make his narcissism a pet project 

00:28:35
RICHARD HILL Do not make his narcissism a pet project. It'll be easy for her to have all the session time about him or the conversations with her friends about him or the reading time books and articles about how to deal with narcissism. You got to get her to realize the codependency in this and steer clear. She should be focusing on her self worth, her boundaries, and consistent demands for equal treatment and resources. 

00:29:00
Know when to walk away 

00:29:05
RICHARD HILL Know when to walk away. Psychotherapy regards narcissism as a failure of relationship. In other words, the NPD failed at relating before he even knew your client. It's possible to change, but it's hard. Your client should think long and hard about whether the rewards are worth the heartache and be willing to walk away when she realizes she can no longer pay such a high emotional toll. This may be necessary, not to punish him, but to protect herself.

Summary AIPC Lecture Series Spot the Narcissist 

00:29:45
RICHARD HILL So, in summary, over the last half hour or so we've been discussing the psychological condition known as narcissistic personality disorder. We've defined it as a pervasive pattern of grandiosity which is accompanied by a need for admiration and a lack of empathy. We've argued that the short definition given those factors is that it is a failure of relationship. We've identified the nine major symptoms of NPD found in the DSM and named three extreme parenting patterns that tend to create the disorder in young children. We've explored the consequences of narcissism and why we let narcissists get away with their behavior. We finished with a list of survival tips for you or any clients dealing with a narcissist. So, we have to say that dealing with a narcissist isn't easy. They will penetrate every protective psychological defense you have whether you are the narcissists partner or acquaintance, therapist, or even the therapist of a client dealing with a narcissist. We urge you get your boundaries in place, stay strong, and what can I say, good luck.
