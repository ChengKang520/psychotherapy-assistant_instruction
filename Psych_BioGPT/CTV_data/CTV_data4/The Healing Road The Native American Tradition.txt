Instituto Familiar de la Raza, Inc This Project is Dedicated to... Dr. Richard Movescamp Ogalala Lakota White Thunder, Mr. Anthony Davis Pawnee who have led countless others down... THE HEALING ROAD Narrated by Floyd Red Crow Westerman Oakland, Ca. 

00:00:05
FLOYD RED CROW WESTERMAN  Hello. I'm Floyd Red Crow Westerman. I'm here to introduce some new ideas about Native American people. First, we have survived. Today, we live in towns and cities as well as on reservations. Second, this survival has not been without a cost. In 1986, a community mental health clinic here in the San Francisco Bay area, began to invite traditional Native American healers to help them provide mental health and substance abuse treatment to their community. After nine years of this approach, a study was done to evaluate how effective this hybrid approach was for Native American people. The results of this study were made available to the Indian community through a video that was produced at that time about the clinic and the work they were doing there. I am here to introduce this video to you. Historical trauma, the intergenerational transmission of traumatic experience, sometimes, we just call it "the soul wound." These interchangeable concepts help us explain the high rate of alcoholism, family violence, and suicide rates that are unacceptably high in the Indian country. The goal of this video is not to teach you a set of skills but an understanding of Indian ways and of Indian thinking which is very different from the linear thinking of the dominant society in clinical and counseling training. We believe that the more aware we are of historical and cultural differences, and the strengths and limitations of these differences, the more helpful you can be as a psychologist or counselor. The topics that are discussed in this video may touch you in very personal ways. Topics like history, culture, and spirituality, are sometimes difficult to talk about. I wish to personally invite you to have a discussion about these ideas and the thoughts you have about what is presented here. In this way, you will walk with me and my Native American brothers and sisters down to the healing road. [non-English narration].

Aniongwea The Original People A health care delivery system for native people 

00:04:20
EDUARDO DURAN  There was, ah, three types of people that, ah, lived here. Ah, for over 5,000 years, they were the Huchian, ah, Saccharin(ph), and Urigan(ph) who collectively are also known as the Ohlone people. And it's a critical importance that we realize that a way of life that existed here in complete balance with, with the world for 5,000 years was disrupted in a very short period of time without any type of grief or to count the loss. 

00:05:10
Executive Producer, Senior Principle Investigator Dr. Eduardo Duran, Ph.D. Apache/Tewa 

00:05:10
EDUARDO DURAN It's ah, very important and, ah, meaningful to me also to introduce, ah, this research project, ah, that we have done at the Family and Child Guidance Clinic here at the Native American Health Center. Is a, ah, great event in the, kinda beginnings of what I call post-colonial research and, ah, also across the country, there's a movement, ah, towards community-based research and this is a way that our community is, is taking back control over the definition of who we are as Indian people. 

00:05:45
Traditional Consultant Richard MovesCamp Ogalala Lakota 

00:05:45
RICHARD MOVESCAMP Through that, you know, many people come to the clinic. This project that was started here, the guidance clinic, was, ah, was a great deal of, a source of helping people out, you know from there they, they have a place like a center to come there seeking for directions. 

00:06:00
EDUARDO DURAN  This model that, ah, we have put together here, at the Family and Child Guidance Clinic, is a model that, ah, integrates, ah, world views, the traditional and the western, and we call it a hybrid model. We don't call it a cross-cultural model 'coz we're not crossing into anywhere. We are working within one place and we're using a hybrid model which is a more post-colonial way of, ah, identifying the model. 

00:06:30
 What's the story about the seeder? What's the story about eagle feather? What's the story about this crystal, ah, this, this, ah, crystal fire? What's the, what's the story about this air? What was the day, the night, the moon and the stars? They ask questions about things like that. 

00:06:45
Therapist Diane Montoya, M.F.C.C. Aha Makov/Hunkpapa Lakota 

00:06:45
DIANE MONTOYA We figure out how to access that for them, that has meaning and matters to them, personally, as well as praying, as well as using, ah, sage or seeder depending on what tribe or what nation, maybe a Jellico root, whatever, depending upon, you know, who, who they are and how they wanna approach that. 

00:07:05
Rowland Rave 

00:07:05
ROWLAND RAVE We do a lot of smudging, and this medicine man would come up into the room and an eagle feather was being passed around. It was, uhm, these counselors were, ah, uhm, on vision quest of their own, were coming in and talking to us and conveying the importance of life and, and compassion and, ah, your, ah, your ancestry and, they really did good for me to pass that feather around. 

00:07:35
EDUARDO DURAN I need to, ah, revert back to the literature when start talking about the, ah, efficacy of this model. Ah, most literature indicates that Indian people drop out of treatment before three sessions of therapy. The particular program that we developed here averaged, ah, 13 visits per client and, ah, as far as the, uhm, measurement of the effectiveness is se, itself, we use the, ah, DSM-IV, ah, GAF score and the Global Assessment of Functioning. And also, ah, statistically and numerically, we had demonstrated through those numbers that the movement, and the healing, and the therapy progressed in a very positive direction for our community that we treated here. Therefore, we have numerical data that indicates that this program is effective and will continue to be effective into the future and can also be duplicated and utilized in other sections of the country. 

00:08:40
RICHARD MOVESCAMP This is a foundation. The way I look at it is this is, like many foundations, this is another approach here, the clinic with, working with traditional and, and the western. It, it's a, it's a step like a, I'd like to see a lot more of them all over. 

00:08:55
EDUARDO DURAN For the study, we analyzed the files of 275 clients who spanned the time of the project. And ah, information from these files were entered into a database and then later analyzed by, ah, SPSS statistical software. And this is a way that our community is, is taking back control over the definition of who we are as Indian people. The population that came into our clinic, ah, looked in a particular way as far as the demographics, and ah, as far as gender, 67 percent of the folks that were seen here were female and 30 percent were males. The average age of our clients was 30. One of the findings that, ah, came out is that, ah, California Native people comprised 18 percent of the population and then people from the plains, Aberdeen area, 15 percent, ah, Oklahoma people, ah, 15 percent, the Phoenix area, 11 percent, ah, Navajo, ah, people, 9 percent of the pe, of the folks that were seen here. Ah, the Billings area represent at 7 percent and the, then the percentages, ah, kept getting smaller and smaller. 

00:10:15
Executive Producer Principle Investigator Susan Yellowhorse-Davis, M.S.W. Ogalala Lakota/Osage 

00:10:15
SUSAN YELLOWHORSE-DAVIS What we know is that Indian people, because they move off the reservation, there's a lot of, uhm, ah, strength and, though I mean, there's high rates of, of separation from family. There's oppression, there's deculturation, ah, loss of employment. All of these psychosocial stressors, uhm, has a large impact on, on, ah, the families. 

00:10:45
Youth Empowerment Program Director Lakota Harden Lakota/Winnabego 

00:10:45
LAKOTA HARDEN My grandmother, when I was born, said, "Name her Lakota because that's the true name of our people." And she was afraid that it would get lost that that would soon disappear too. And so my name was Lakota. All my life it wasn't this new thing I just became. It, it was, it, it, it was really a reflection of who I was at all times, being in boarding school and being with, you know, looking at the kids from all over the place. And then being at a young age and just being like cattle, you know, on the way they treated us. And I look back and it's, it's a crime. It's, it's, it's ludicrous. It's the worst thing you can do to children that, what they did to us on a daily basis and it was normalized, you know, it was supposed to be that way. And a lot my, uhm, problems that I have now that I've had the hardest time conquering like, uhm, eating disorders or, uhm, uhm, stability staying in one place. You know, there's this little behaviors that I've noticed that are totally, directly affected. Even decision making because the boarding school system is a good training to be a model prisoner, you know, the same thing, a bell rings and you get up, a bell rings and you go to the shower, a bell rings and you go to breakfast and they feed you. It's a good training to be pacified and to not think. And, uhm, luckily for me, it had the opposite effect because I started organizing in boarding school and got some things changed and, and we've figured out how to defend ourselves. 

00:12:15
Perinatal Department Wini La Rock Spirit Lake Dakota 

00:12:15
WINI LA ROCK I've been in the community all my life. My, ah, product of relocation, my parents came out here. My education, it was really like, ah, stereotype and, uhm, the people did confuse me with being of another race because, you know, of what they thought and Indian should look like. We've lived on, uhm, my ex-husband's reservation and stuff and while my kids were growing up and, uhm, we moved back to the city and they went like, and they're kinda culture shocked, you know, and so we moved into a small reservation where they were you know, surrounded by Indians and coming into the city and, uhm, going to a predominantly white school. And then where I lived at were the predominantly Black neighborhood, you know, there was no Indians in between there and here. 

00:13:05
DIANE MONTOYA Historical trauma to me is an intergenerational, ah, matter and that, ah, there are various forms of trauma. There, trauma, there's your primary, your secondary, and your insidious types of trauma. Prior generations suffered more of a direct primary sorts of trauma. Now, it's more of a secondary trauma. 

00:13:30
SUSAN YELLOWHORSE-DAVIS What we found was 64 percent of our population had substance abuse disorders. And when we lift that gender differences, we found that 59 percent of women had substance abuse disorders and 72 percent of men had substance abuse disorders. After we'd looked at substance abuse disorders, we looked at anxiety disorders. And interestingly, what we found was that 58 percent had anxiety disorders. Another thing that we looked at was how anxiety disorders were related to substance abuse disorders. Interestingly, what we found was that anxiety disorders was the same for substance abuse and non-substance abusers. So regardless of whether our clients were using or not they're still suffering from anxiety. 

00:14:25
EDUARDO DURAN  It is, ah, very interesting to all of us on this project to find that, ah, ah, the diagnostic picture of the clients that, ah, were studied is consistent with, ah, the, the notions and the ideas that we had about the soul wound and historical trauma. Ah, the, ah, idea that, ah, anxiety exists regardless of whether there's substance abuse or not, indicates to us that there is this level of anxiety that is underlying all of the other problems that our population is experiencing. And this anxiety is also correlated to the post-traumatic stress disorder that we have, ah, and also postulating throughout the clinical program and also on the research side of the program. 

00:15:15
Rowland Rave 

00:15:15
ROWLAND RAVE Before going to my last rehab, I knew that I better get this one straight because I didnt think, pretty much, you could bet that I wasn't gonna have another program in me. I was gonna die from this, this alcoholism. And so, I was very, ah, ah, I was really, ah, surrendering, surrendering to, ah, this life force to take care of me, this Ma'una, Earth Maker, like that. Today, I'm thankful for my life. I'm happy, I'm thankful for this, this, ah, being blessed with this Mother Earth. And everyday I'd wake up with birds, sometimes going to school. And, and I, I, I will sit up and I'm calm to hear those birds like that. I'm calm and, and I remember that eagle feather and that man's group, and these programs who've come in, who, who just really, who, who know how hard it is for a, a ma, ah, Indian person to make it in this, in this walk of life. 

00:16:15
Traditional Consultant Daniel Freeland Dine' 

00:16:15
DANIEL FREELAND The way, ah, native stories are, is that there is a divine creator that created this Mother Earth, and this fire, this water, and this air. For example, with our tribe, like the five fingers, how we look at on it, said this bottom one right here, that's your daddy. This top one right here is your mother, quite shallow woman your daddy and your momma, that's makes you what you are right here, this is you. This one here I, is, is the Mother Earth, and this one here is the masculine and feminine air, and this one right here is the crystal fire, and this one right here is the water. Those four elements is what the divine creator took to make your daddy, your momma, and you, who you are. These are your relatives, your relation. You look at it, you're short, you're the shortest of the four elements right here. So when you, when you, when you look at it that way, but when you bring it down, then you stand above the four sacred mountains(ph). This, this symbolizes our home regulation, like that. That's our teachings, the group that's right here, who you are, your identity. So long, as long as that kinda story is there, there's no way you can lose it. There's no way you can, huh, say it's lost. That's, that's who you are. That's what you are. You're created in a very sacred, divine, holy way. You're very special no matter what you did, no matter what you gone through. Right now, while you're sitting, the fact that you're having that concern about who you are, what you are, that's what you're missing, that's what you're looking for. It's all right here, it's not out there, it's right here. You're created in a very sacred, divine, holy way. That's how you are. And that might be the longest journey of your life, to, to understand that, but that's how you are until you can understand that. So what you're going through and where you're at right now or anything, this is what I am and all of that, that's just a label. You might be experiencing it, yes. You might be physically, psychologically addicted to some of these things but that doesn't make you who you are. You have to go beneath that. 

00:18:15
EDUARDO DURAN Traditional people, ah, have told me that, ah, we can focus on things like historical trauma and soul wound, and that's okay. But what we need to do is, also, we need to turn that and look on the other side of that. And on the other side of this historical trauma, the medicine is already there. And that's what we tried and has accomplished here at the Family and Child Guidance Clinic, is that we took that trauma and that pain, and we looked within that pain and we found that the medicine and the healing is also right within their pain. And that's what we're using in here in order to heal the wounds of our community.

Native American Health Board Executive Director Martin Waukazoo Rosebud Lakota/Ojibway 

00:18:55
MARTIN WAUKAZOO When I was going, came out through the (inaudible ) area(ph) that generation ahead of me went out there. They wouldn't listen, they ignored me, or they were with me in the bars. And that's, that, that's changing. I'm excited about the younger generation, and I could, in my mind, in my mind, that's the seventh generation. They're a healthy generation. They're not gonna have those, they're getting rid of some of that, the boarding school and some of the, you know, the, the other problems that were, just became a part of our culture and tradition. Now, they're kind of growing up healthier. The seventh generation is a very powerful generation. These youth that are, that are coming up, they're powerful. They're proud of who they are.

00:19:40
FLOYD RED CROW WESTERMAN  Now you know something about the history and the problems that Native American people sometimes struggle with. You also know something about the solutions that we think are most effective. In a moment, I will ask you to listen to a discussion between four psychologists. These psychologists are going to discuss some of the themes that are very important in the original people. They will be talking about the impact and influence of history, culture, identity, and spirituality as they apply to the work of helping other people's people. But first, let me introduce my brothers and sisters who have agreed to help with this project. Professor Teresa LaFromboise, Ph.D.-

00:22:30
Derald Wing Sue, Ph.D. 

00:22:30
DERALD WING SUE  Now, I just wanna make some comments about, ah, the opening of this, uhm, particular video because I thought it was so, ah, impactful, ah, for me in terms of the juxtaposition of the opening, with all of a sudden the driving force of the urban, ah, environment. Uhm, and if you can, can recall back at the beginning, what we he, heard was a song throughout with the wind blowing, the trees... (crosstalk) 

00:23:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:23:00
DERALD WING SUE ...swaying. Uhm, it, it got me in touch, I think, with something that was peaceful, restful, harmonious, it was connected to uhm, ah, to the environment, to the universe. These were all images that were created to me. And then all of a sudden the film snaps where you see the city and the driving, uhm, uhm, music, and I think one of the, ah, people commented, uhm, that within a very short period of time this change had occurred, and that there was a loss of, of, ah, I consider it to be an indigenous way of life, ah, and that people, thi, this change, ah, was so fast that people had, didn't have an opportunity to grieve about... (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:23:40
DERALD WING SUE ...a loss of something. And I think that this really to me is symbolic, ah, of the split we currently see, uhm, ah, in our society, ah, the, you know, the driving technological fast paced action that has somehow driven us away from, uhm, you know, Mother Earth, or the environment. 

00:24:05
TERESA LAFROMBOISE But you know, ah, one thing that, ah, strikes me about that is that it isn't necessarily even in the past. (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:24:10
TERESA LAFROMBOISE You know, when you think of the transition that people make from, uhm, a, a, a quieter, a mellower, slower paced life on the reservation, even just coming here to the Bay Area to visit... (crosstalk) 

00:24:20
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:24:20
Teresa LaFromboise, Ph.D. Miami 

00:24:20
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...relatives or going back and forth. And a lot of people do go back and forth quite a bit. But there is a change, right? You know, I hear from people that come to visit me that they can't, they don't understand how I could put up with the noise... (crosstalk) 

00:24:35
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:24:35
TERESA LAFROMBOISE  on the street, just right out in front of the house... (crosstalk) 

00:24:37
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:24:37
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...or, uhm, you know, the air. They start to feel different about the air. 

00:24:40
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:24:40
TERESA LAFROMBOISE And, ah, just the timing of things, and just getting... (crosstalk) 

00:24:45
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:24:45
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...on the freeway, and uhm, so I think it, even though it has, ha, it has impacted people historically, it's still that something... (crosstalk) 

00:24:50
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:24:50
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...that people go... (crosstalk) 

00:24:50
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:24:50
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...through transitioning back and forth... (crosstalk) 

00:24:50
MICHAEL D' ANDREA  Uh hmm. 

00:24:55
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...between, uhm, you know, rural reservation areas and urban areas. 

00:24:55
Madonna Constantine, Ph.D. 

00:24:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE I keep thinking about, ah, in the film and just based on other conversations and I think that we, that we've had before this, the notion of, of soul wound, uhm, and just what that represents in Native American clients that I've seen, uhm, in the past and e, e, even other kind of ethnic and, and racial groups, what it means to have been traumatized. (crosstalk) 

00:25:20
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:25:20
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Ah, so in the past such that, uhm, in a sense, there's an intergenerational... (crosstalk) 

00:25:25
 Hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:25:25
MADONNA CONSTANTINE  kind of process... (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:30
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...that it perpetuates over... (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:30
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...kinda generations. Things that... (crosstalk) 

00:25:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:30
MADONNA CONSTANTINE  affected, uhm, our grandfathers and mothers... (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:35
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...affect us today. (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:35
MADONNA CONSTANTINE And, and really, really, what that means for clients coming in and... (crosstalk) 

00:25:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:40
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...how therapists can best understand... (crosstalk) 

00:25:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...it with, I don't know how they can understand it without considering the historical... (crosstalk) 

00:25:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...and cultural contexts. 

00:25:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:50
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Because if you just examine what's happening today, you don't have an appreciation for the full picture... (crosstalk) 

00:25:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:25:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE  of... (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:00
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...those clients'... (crosstalk) 

00:26:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:00
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...experiences. 

00:26:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:00
MADONNA CONSTANTINE And I guess I, I'm wondering a little bit, as psychologists, how we can best do that? How can we best encourage other colleagues to do that? (crosstalk) 

00:26:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:10
MADONNA CONSTANTINE How can we help clients to get in touch with aspects of their history and culture... (crosstalk) 

00:26:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:15
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...that are so meaningful to them in ways that they may not be even be aware of how... (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:20
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...important it... (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:20
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...is to their current circumstances. 

00:26:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:25
Michael D'Andrea, Ph.D. 

00:26:25
MICHAEL D' AANDREA And one of the points that I'm picking up from the two of you, and it's helpful is, when I think about what is a culturally competent mental health professional, what is it to be a competent healer? I guess we've, I guess one of the things we look at is an awareness of history. And, and the, (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:26:40
MICHAEL D' AANDREA the two things that I hear, Teresa, you and Derald saying is that there is a, a rich history that has been, in a short period of time, dismantled without appropriate grieving mechanisms and rituals and so it's a little... (crosstalk) 

00:26:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:26:50
MICHAEL D' AANDREA ...wonder that native people are internalizing so much pain, and as a result, demonstrating these symptoms of alcoholism... (crosstalk) 

00:27:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:27:00
MICHAEL D' AANDREA ...or suicide. But you said something that was different. And that that the history is not past, that people... (crosstalk) 

00:27:05
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:27:05
MICHAEL D' AANDREA  continue to make the transition from reservation or from rural area to visit family and friends in the urban areas and... (crosstalk) 

00:27:15
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Uh hmm. 

00:27:15
MICHAEL D' AANDREA ...as a mental health practitioner, it kinda sensitizes me to the on-going trauma... (crosstalk) 

00:27:20
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Uh-huh. 

00:27:20
MICHAEL D' AANDREA ...and the shift, that sensitive and more natural people experience, more gentle people coming in and out of this... (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:27:30
MICHAEL D' ANDREA ...frenzied environment. 

00:27:30
 Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:27:30
MICHAEL D' ANDREA So that historical piece is important for me to keep in mind. 

00:27:35
Derald Wing Sue, Ph.D. 

00:27:35
DERALD WING SUE It's not that, uhm, I think Euro-Americans are not, uhm, collectivistic. And in fact, I've looked at the literature and the history from the early, uhm, ah, ah, you know, ah, coming to the United States. They, you know, it used to be that Euro-Americans were very extended families, relied on one another, things occurred that separated technology, uhm, ah, you know, uhm... (crosstalk) 

00:28:00
 Distance. 

00:28:00
DERALD WING SUE The distance... (crosstalk) 

00:28:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:28:00
DERALD WING SUE ...and everything... (crosstalk) 

00:28:00
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:28:00
DERALD WING SUE  else broke and that, so that a whole new value... (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:28:05
DERALD WING SUE ...of individualism... (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:28:05
DERALD WING SUE  cropped up. (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:28:10
DERALD WING SUE Ah, ah, until now, it inundates our standards of normality... (crosstalk) 

00:28:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:28:10
DERALD WING SUE ...and, and abnormality. I've, I've watched this video many times. That's why I almost know it by heart. In terms of, uhm, there are really three themes that come across so strongly, uhm, ah, in this, uhm, ah, in, in, in terms of when you talk about the Native American, uhm, you know, ah, world view in life. And those are harmony and balance, spirituality and, uhm, collectivism or the interconnectedness... (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:28:40
DERALD WING SUE ...of, of everyone, ah, in the universe. And if you look at those, are those three principles, principles that we need to infuse back in, ah, to the counseling profession? Because we, we don't legitimize spirituality as a legitimate aspect of, of healing. Uhm, we, we, we really are an individualistic society, not a collectivistic one. Ah, and this gets to, I think an earlier discunion, discussion we had about, uhm, you know, how do we deal with the soul wound? And I think that... (crosstalk) 

00:29:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:15
DERALD WING SUE ...one of them, is that the only way that we deal with it is to become connected, see each other as connected to one another, not as separated. (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
DERALD WING SUE Ah, because the pain of one is, divorce for me, if I'm separated. (crosstalk) 

00:29:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:30
DERALD WING SUE If I see you as part of, of, of me, the pain that goes to you hurts me as well... (crosstalk) 

00:29:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:35
DERALD WING SUE ...or my group, ah, as much. And I think we moved away from that. 

00:29:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:40
Teresa LaFromboise, Ph.D. Miami 

00:29:40
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Oh, I think that's what they're saying here. I mean, it's the healing path. 

00:29:40
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:29:40
TERESA LAFROMBOISE  How do we deal with the soul... (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:45
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...wound just through the healing path... (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
 Uh hmm, Uh hmm. 

00:29:45
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...which is a lifelong endeavor. (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
 Yeah. 

00:29:45
TERESA LAFROMBOISE In maintaining, you know, one's connection with the creator. (crosstalk) 

00:29:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:50
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:29:50
TERESA LAFROMBOISE And we all have different ways of doing that. 

00:29:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:29:55
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Uhm, and so I would assume that some of what we could do as, as therapist, is to encourage clients... (crosstalk) 

00:30:00
 Yeah. 

00:30:00
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...to seek that path. I mean, we can't necessarily do that with them. (crosstalk) 

00:30:05
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Yeah. 

00:30:05
TERESA LAFROMBOISE But we can certainly... (crosstalk) 

00:30:05
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:30:05
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...be a part of a healing path of our own. 

00:30:10
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Yeah. 

00:30:10
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Part of the healing community. And, uhm, and there which would help us feel, ah, more confident about, you know, so, so, sort of supporting someone... (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:30:20
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...search for that in their own lives. 

00:30:20
MICHAEL D' ANDREA I'd like what you're saying because when I was watching Dr. Duran on the video, it sounded like he was saying, what you're saying Teresa is that as we are searching for finding ways of linking traditional healing methods with Western psychological concepts and maybe that's a future direction of this new paradigm that we've been in search... (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:30:40
MICHAEL D' ANDREA ...for, for... (crosstalk) 

00:30:40
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:30:40
MICHAEL D' ANDREA ...the last couple of decades. 

00:30:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. We can't keep doing what we've been doing. 

00:30:45
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:30:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uhm, 'coz that clearly hasn't worked. 

00:30:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:30:50
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:30:50
MADONNA CONSTANTINE and so I admire, places like the Oakland Native American Clinic in other... (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:30:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...uhm, facilities... (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
TERESE LAFROMBOISE Uh hmm. 

00:30:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...that are looking at more traditional, ah, native models that appealing... (crosstalk) 

00:31:00
 Uh hmm. 

00:31:00
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...in health... (crosstalk) 

00:31:00
  Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:31:05
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...ah, and growth and I think that's, (crosstalk) 

00:31:05
 Uh hmm. 

00:31:05
MADONNA CONSTANTINE that is the future. 

00:31:05
"...I lost my Traditions, I lost my Culture 

00:31:05
Or I been raised up more Western And that's how my teachings are. So I don't really know My Native Tribe's Language..." Daniel Freeland, Dine' 

00:31:05
FLOYD RED CROW WESTERMAN  The native people, we say, ah, ah, I lost my traditions, I lost my culture or I have been raised up more Western and that's how my teachings are. So I don't really know my native tribe language. 

00:31:25
MICHAEL D' ANDREA  So is that unhealthy? To be a person of different ethnic racial groups and to give that up and to assimilate into the, ah, culture you've talked Derald about, you know, how there's a lot of press to not talk Chinese and to assimilate into the American cul, is it from a psychological, ah, perspective, we have whites saying, "Come on now, let's... (crosstalk) 

00:31:55
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:31:55
MICHAEL D' ANDREA ...move on and let's be a part of America, the United States." 

00:31:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:31:55
MICHAEL D' ANDREA So I guess I'm interested from, from your perspectives. Is it unhealthy? 

00:32:00
Derald Wing Sue, Ph.D. 

00:32:00
DERALD WING SUE I, I think the issue, Michael, is, is, is you have choice. Uhm, and I, and when I was young I don't feel, and I'd say I think that, ah, was ever giving, ah, a choice of being monolingual... (crosstalk) 

00:32:10
MADONNA CONSTANTINE  Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:32:15
DERALD WING SUE ...of being a multicultural. Uhm, it was, you know, or even deciding that I wanted to, uhm, you know, adapt and accept the ways of, of the larger culture or society. It was just simply imposed on you... (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:32:25
DERALD WING SUE ...and you did it uhm, ah, for that particular reason which is far different than a, for example, there are, uhm, ah, features of, of Native American culture that I value and I want to move towards. That's different from being forced to, to accept it 'coz that does strange things to your head... (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:32:45
DERALD WING SUE ...in your, ah, identity. (crosstalk) 

00:32:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:32:45
DERALD WING SUE And it's invisible to you that is, ah, is occurring to you. 

00:32:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:32:50
DERALD WING SUE But the question you asked really, uhm, ah, is something I've wrestled, which is that, uhm, if we live truly in a diverse society, in a multicultural society and there, the interracial, uhm, uhm marriages are occurring, uhm, a, we're dealing with biracial, multiracial, uhm, ah, children and offspring. What is a healthy identity to have? 

00:33:15
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:33:15
DERALD WING SUE I mean, how do you, what does it look like? 

00:33:15
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:33:15
DERALD WING SUE Uhm, it, it's a difficult question I think, uhm, ah, for, for example, we have an offspring of an Asian-American, African-American, ah, or even more greater combinations. I mean, how do you merge those or integrate those, uhm, ah, cultural ah, differences that affect your own ah, identity? That's why I was fascinated with doctor, ah, Duran's statement of a hybrid. It's not... (crosstalk) 

00:33:40
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:33:40
DERALD WING SUE  cross-cultural. (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uhm. Yeah. 

00:33:45
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Uh-huh. 

00:33:45
DERALD WING SUE The services they give are hybrid. 

00:33:45
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:33:45
DERALD WING SUE What does that look like? 

00:33:45
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:33:45
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Well I think, you know, there are some people that handle it very, very easily and some not. I just, you know, with just looking within the diversity within the populations. But I, I guess I'm, I'm thinking of some of the students that I worked with who are, uhm, multiracial. And I could remember one student talking about him being, uhm, was Apache, and Hispanic, and Asian... (crosstalk) 

00:34:10
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:34:10
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...and, uhm, I believe, uhm, Euro-American. (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
 Uh hmm. 

00:34:15
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Okay, and he said that his parents made a very active effort for him to understand each of those cultures. 

00:34:20
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Whoa, whoa, whoa. 

00:34:20
TERESA LAFROMBOISE So he felt very comfortable... (crosstalk) 

00:34:25
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:34:25
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...and, uhm, and, and, and he said, we, we intended so, and I mean he's basically talking about, you know, some of the... (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:34:30
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...events, some of the ceremonies so, and we talked about it. We, we did all these and, uhm, and he felt that it enriched his life, you know... (crosstalk) 

00:34:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:34:35
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...and he wouldn't identify... (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
 Yeah. 

00:34:40
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...with anyone... (crosstalk) 

00:34:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:34:40
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...more strongly than another. 

00:34:40
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:34:40
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:34:40
TERESA LAFROMBOISE And, I mean, that, that's an unusual story... (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Yeah. 

00:34:45
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...that that's certainly one that was... (crosstalk) 

00:34:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:34:45
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...amazing. 

00:34:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:34:45
TERESA LAFROMBOISE And then, ah, I would also have sa, I think that also with younger people now, they, ah, especially if it's not easy to, uhm, determine what their ethnicity might be because... (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:34:55
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...of their phenotype. That they've, might even try it on the other ones... (crosstalk) 

00:35:00
 Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:35:00
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...just to have the experience of that. 

00:35:05
 Uh hmm, uh hmm, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:35:05
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:35:05
TERESA LAFROMBOISE The difficult part is, you know, how much of it is this conflict of cultures that, ah, really debilitates us, okay. 

00:35:10
 Uh hmm. 

00:35:10
TERESA LAFROMBOISE How, how much of it is, you know, uhm, ah, adapting to the situation that has many, many cultural demands. 

00:35:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:35:20
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Uhm, and how much of it is really being a chameleon and not really...(crosstalk) 

00:35:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:35:25
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...being anything? 

00:35:25
MADONNA CONSTANTINE This discussion reminds me of, uhm, how difficult that whole issue is for African-Americans. 

00:35:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:35:30
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:35:30
 Uh hmm. 

00:35:30
MADONNA CONSTANTINE  because se, selling out... (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
 Uh hmm. 

00:35:35
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...has a real negative connotation, uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
 Uh hmm. 

00:35:40
MADONNA CONSTANTINE I think for African Americans. And people who were, uhm, kinda fairer in... (crosstalk) 

00:35:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:35:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...phenotype, lighter skinned African Americans who passed as Black and, and things of that nature. So it, it, it, for me it feels a little bit harder to... (crosstalk) 

00:35:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:35:50
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...kind of shift myself across different, uhm, kind of settings... (crosstalk) 

00:35:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:35:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE  because, uhm, while I may, ah, as an educator, I may interact in a certain way and kind of in my professional life, I'd bring parts of my, ah, African American culture to that and I, I want, I wanna be reminded... (crosstalk) 

00:36:10
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:36:10
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...of that, but I want the people interacting with me to be reminded of that too. 

00:36:15
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:36:15
MADONNA CONSTANTINE And part of the way that I do that, uhm, the way I wear my hair is a very deliberate... (crosstalk) 

00:36:20
 Yeah. 

00:36:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:36:20
 Yeah. 

00:36:20
 Uh hmm. 

00:36:20
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Choice. I recognize that... (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
 Uh hmm. 

00:36:25
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...probably if I had relaxed, straight, longer, you know, length hair that, uhm, people would respond to me, ah, very differently that I might get certain types of rewards for how I looked. Uhm, if I fit in more or assimilated more into white culture. (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:36:40
MADONNA CONSTANTINE But I feel like I work with kinda mostly white people, and I don't want them... (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:36:40
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...to forget that I'm an African- (crosstalk) 

00:36:45
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:36:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE American woman, uhm, whose culture needs... (crosstalk) 

00:36:45
 Uh hmm. 

00:36:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...to be represented in the workplace that... (crosstalk) 

00:36:50
 Uh hmm. 

00:36:50
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...I think that that's true for clients that their kind of cultural backgrounds and experiences and aspects of their identity need to be represented... (crosstalk) 

00:36:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:36:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...in the counseling... (crosstalk) 

00:36:55
 Uh hmm. 

00:37:00
relationship... (crosstalk) 

00:37:00
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:37:00
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...and what do we do to support that? 

00:37:00
DERALD WING SUE Ah, ah, I, I think one of this is that how can you be multicultural in behaviors and values and attitudes without the sense of a loss of integrity 'coz you are, ah, ah, the feelings of selling out come when you feel an assailing I think of your personal, uhm, ah, integrity. And I experienced this when I was at Berkeley working with, uhm, ah, a group of, uhm, Third World, you know, students that there was, was a term that we used then. And I ran these, uhm, job interview. Uhm, you know, they were seniors, how do you interview for successful employment? And I was talking to them about eye contact, wearing ties, uhm, ah, appropriate ways and one of the students, one of, one student of color says that you're asking me to be white. (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:37:50
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:37:50
DERALD WING SUE You're asking me to sell out what originally, uhm, I thought about it. I, I didn't have a comeback or an answer. (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:37:55
DERALD WING SUE And eventually, I realized that, uhm, that was what was coming across to them... (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:38:00
MICHEAL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:38:00
DERALD WING SUE ...when I was trying to teach them how to survive. You're using, you can divorce that from the sense of your own, uhm, ah, integrity. You're playing, uhm, ah, a game or if you see it as an adaptive mechanism that you don't feel violates who you are, that's what being a multicultural, you change the way, you adapt. 

00:38:20
MADONNA CONSTANTINE  I feel in the past that that to some degree is what I've asked clients to do if I've not incorporated salient cultural issues at least for them. 

00:38:30
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:38:30
MADONNA CONSTANTINE  Uhm, if I asked them to adapt in my way of being as a counselor that in fact in this kind of role I act a certain way, you act to certain way. And, uhm, in fact, I'll educate you about how you should act as a client so that we can make this work, without considering some of the, the cultural i, cultural issues that they bring to the table. 

00:38:55
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. When you talk about power, if, ah, you know, not even talk about, uhm, ah, therapy but when you, how, talk about what is the definition of power, my definition of power is that the group that controls the definition of reality... (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Yeah, that's. (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
DERALD WING SUE ...is the group that holds the power. (crosstalk) 

00:39:10
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:39:10
DERALD WING SUE I mean not necessarily... (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
MICHAEL D' ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:39:15
Derald Wing Sue, Ph.D. 

00:39:15
DERALD WING SUE ...economics strongly correlated with it. Now, Robert Guthrie's book, and this is something I'd, you, you know I'd ta, talked to, uhm, ah, even the rat was white. Ah, the, in a statement about psychology, is not so much as, ah, you know, uhm, ah, a, a, a, discussion about, we've left out the contributions of Black psychologists and, ah, Asian psychologists. Although that's part of that, the power of his book is in a very profound question, and that is, "Who owns... (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
DERALD WING SUE ...history?" (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Uh-huh. 

00:39:45
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
DERALD WING SUE Uhm, and you know, that... (crosstalk) 

00:39:45
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:39:45
DERALD WING SUE  really is, is the issue... (crosstalk) 

00:39:50
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:39:50
DERALD WING SUE ...and as long as our society is controlled by one reality, ah, it affects all of us. What happens if that reality is an inaccurate, distorted one? 

00:40:00
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Uh hmm. 

00:40:00
DERALD WING SUE For example, uhm, you know, oftentimes I, I've been told uhm, ah, well, Thomas se, se, said, you, you get a white uhm, ah, woman walking into the elevator... (crosstalk) 

00:40:10
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:40:10
DERALD WING SUE ...and there is a Black male. (crosstalk) 

00:40:15
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Okay. 

00:40:15
DERALD WING SUE Ah, her reality is, and she decides not to take the elevator. Her reality really is that... (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:40:20
DERALD WING SUE ...my life maybe in danger. (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:40:20
DERALD WING SUE So, that the battle we have as uhm, psychologist and citizens, I think is that how do we begin to get the society to recognize the legitimate of, ah, legitimacy of our alternative realities because white folks, as you say, cannot part, I mean, they have such a difficult time seeing that to be non- white is a completely different reality than they're used to. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
Michael D'Andrea, Ph.D. 

00:40:45
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Well, your question is really a powerful one. How do we get large numbers of people in this country and particularly in the helping professions to legitimize different constructions of reality? I think the film by Dr. Duran and others is one way but, and let me kinda interject a real quick case study. We had a third grade. Ah, third grade, Filipino boy. Ah, second generation ah, who is in the public schools who came home and found his mother dying ah, had a cardiovascular problem... (crosstalk) 

00:41:20
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:41:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...and, and, and, and she died literally with him calling 911. Traumatized and about four months after the funeral, there had been ah, decline in his schoolwork. He became isolated from his peers. Ah, he demonstrated clinical symptoms of depression and then began to talk to his mother regularly in the classroom. A western... (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. 

00:41:45
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...psychiatrist diagnosed him with major depression and was put on psychotropic medication, for two months. Uhm, there was no improvement. And so we were called in from the university to do an assessment of what was going on. And in investigating the Filipino religious traditions related to death and dying ah, the combination of Christianity and Animus ah, traditions where the spirit is temporarily... (crosstalk) 

00:42:10
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Uh hmm. 

00:42:10
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...still present. And I, I found myself just expanding my awareness of an alternative reality. Well the long and short of it was, that we worked from that framework and in counseling sessions with this young child, had him converse with the mother. We asked him for instance, was his mother present now? And he said, "Yes." And we said, "Where?" in one to one counseling, he said, "Right in that chair." "And your mother is there now, what is she saying?" "She's saying that everything will be okay, don't worry, I'm still with you." 

00:42:40
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:42:40
MICHEAL D'ANDREA And we had him engage conversation... (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:42:40
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...right there with him. We continue to have, allow him to have time during the day where he could come in and talk to his mother when, so he wouldn't be disrupted in class. (crosstalk) 

00:42:50
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:42:50
MICHEAL D'ANDREA We also provided in service with teachers to educate them about a very different tradition of... (crosstalk) 

00:42:55
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Uh hmm. 

00:42:55
MICHEAL D'ANDREA  dealing with death and dying. My own parents had died in 1989 within the same year. Uhm, I, I would be hesitant to say this to psychologist but I feel their presence routinely in my life. (crosstalk) 

00:43:10
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:43:10
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Not, not, not in hallucination... (crosstalk) 

00:43:10
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:43:10
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...but I feel their presence. 

00:43:10
DERALD WING SUE If uhm, the viewers were a group of uhm, professional psychologist, therapist... (crosstalk) 

00:43:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:43:20
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:43:20
DERALD WING SUE ...while listening to, you describe... (crosstalk) 

00:43:20
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Uh hmm. 

00:43:20
DERALD WING SUE ...this ah, can you imagine what they would, they, they would be aghast. They would say that ah, this is supernatural, uhm, healing that you're engaged in... (crosstalk) (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:43:30
DERALD WING SUE ...it's not science. (crosstalk) 

00:43:30
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:43:30
DERALD WING SUE  Ah, that's all the, and, and that is the reality the clash of, of physical ah, reality, sensory reality versus spiritual reality that operates on a different plane. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
MICHEAL D'ANDREA And the conservative... (crosstalk) 

00:43:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:43:45
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...politicians are right when they say there is a cultural crisis in our country. (crosstalk) 

00:43:50
DERALD WING SUE Uh-huh. 

00:43:50
MICHEAL D'ANDREA And when you see Dr. Duran saying, Native American people would drop out after three sessions but if you use this type of intervention, the average 13. You will have a large number of psychologist worldwide, who are trying to embrace this ethnocentric way of working. (crosstalk) 

00:44:05
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:44:05
MICHEAL D'ANDREA  But what it comes down to manage care and dollars and cents, there is going to be an econo, not a humanistic nor a culturally respectable shift. And when people begin to recognize that these cultural interventions not only make moral sense, they make economic sense, you will see a transition. 

00:44:25
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:44:25
MICHEAL D'ANDREA The United States is, is really, really paced to create change based on economics and politics, not moral principle... (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:44:35
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...slavery really didn't end over moral principles. (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:44:35
MICHEAL D'ANDREA As much as it was a political, military... (crosstalk) 

00:44:40
DERALD WING SUE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:44:40
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...economically. And so what I would argue there is that, with the changing transformation, if they're gonna remain viable and pay the mortgage and pay for the car and pay for their kids' college, psychologist are going to have, out of necessity, reassess the ineffective techniques that they have been socialized to use in a diverse context. (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:44:55
MICHEAL D'ANDREA There's no turning back the clock. 

00:45:00
Madonna Constantine, Ph.D. 

00:45:00
MADONNA CONSTANTINE And slavery has existed with most kind of major ethnic groups in this country. Uhm, at some level, and for African-American's, this sometimes are, or Black Americans, they sometimes, they sense that it's hard to move on from where we are because we need certain things to happen. We need uhm, for there to be an apology... (crosstalk) 

00:45:20
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:45:20
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...from white people about slavery. (crosstalk) 

00:45:20
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:45:20
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...we need that kind of, acknowledged in an active way and, and so forth. And I guess the, the, what, what I think about sometimes is, well, what if white people aren't willing to apologize? 

00:45:30
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:45:30
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Does that mean that I have to stay mired in, in, in the past? Or in uhm, oppression or in a place where I feel that I'm not going to be as good as because of these things that have happened. Uhm, and so I, I think it's a difficult issue, while I do think it's important to acknowledge ah, past injustices through study... (crosstalk) 

00:45:50
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:45:50
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...slavery and other types of oppressive uhm, phenomena. (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:45:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE I also think, I need to feel empowered ah, personally and I think that, that, that African-Americans, as a people... (crosstalk) 

00:46:05
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:46:05
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...need to feel empowered. Some of that will have to happen from inside here... (crosstalk) 

00:46:10
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:46:10
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...which I think, I mean, I do think that God is inside me and so that I need to connect with, with him to understand myself better and understand my experiences better. But I think, that a lot of that is about what goes on in here and not so much what has influenced me out there... (crosstalk) 

00:46:25
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:46:25
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...'Coz if I don't, if I looked at just out here to define me uhm, I'm in trouble. 

00:46:30
DERALD WING SUE When you said that white folks might be unwilling... (crosstalk) 

00:46:35
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:46:35
DERALD WING SUE ...to apologize, is it possible that white folks are also wounded? 

00:46:40
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:46:40
Derald Wing Sue, Ph.D. 

00:46:40
DERALD WING SUE Ah, and that, the pain of recognizing uhm, you know, you see, I come from ah, ah, ah, a philosophical ah, belief that we are all, that white folks are connected with us... (crosstalk) 

00:46:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:46:55
DERALD WING SUE ...regardless... (crosstalk) 

00:46:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Absolutely. 

00:46:55
DERALD WING SUE ..of what they ah, might, might uhm, I think, is it possible that, and it's almost genetic. They can't, look(ph), avoid it. 

00:47:05
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:47:05
DERALD WING SUE We are all connected... (crosstalk) 

00:47:05
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:47:05
DERALD WING SUE ...in some sense. 

00:47:05
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:47:05
DERALD WING SUE The realization that they have done things like uhm, groups have done things like uhm, uhm, you know, genocide of, of the Native Americans, enslavement of African-Americans. (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:47:15
DERALD WING SUE  The internment of the Japanese-Americans. (crosstalk) 

00:47:20
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:47:20
DERALD WING SUE The Holocaust, uhm, the ethnic cleansing that has gone on that it is so difficult for some people to apologize... (crosstalk) 

00:47:30
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:47:30
DERALD WING SUE ...because they then have to get in touch with having been at some level responsible... (crosstalk) 

00:47:35
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:47:35
DERALD WING SUE ...ah, for hurting uhm, ah, others and by virtue, themselves as well. And that, that prevents them from, they don't want, the, it's too painful for them to look at. (crosstalk) 

00:47:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:47:45
DERALD WING SUE So they do every, all these layers to distance themselves ah, intellectually... (crosstalk) 

00:47:50
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:47:50
DERALD WING SUE To escape the fact that uhm, the realization that I've been responsible... (crosstalk) 

00:47:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. Yes. 

00:47:55
DERALD WING SUE ...at some level for ah, what has happened. 

00:47:55
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Okay. 

00:47:55
MICHEAL D'ANDREA And how does the spiritual dimension come in if it all, in your mind? 

00:48:00
Teresa LaFromboise, Ph.D. Miami 

00:48:00
TERESA LAFROMBOISE When you become involved in a ceremonial way of life... (crosstalk) 

00:48:05
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:48:05
TERESA LAFROMBOISE You know, it's really a network of people that are... (crosstalk) 

00:48:05
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:48:05
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...practicing ah, and, and in, and, and, ah, holding and participating in ceremonies and there's all these sort of reciprocal obligations that you have... (crosstalk) 

00:48:15
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:48:15
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...with one another and ways in which you help one another. And it's really uhm, uhm, a wider... (crosstalk) 

00:48:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:48:20
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...extended family. And so you do feel the social support. The social support can be so helpful. 

00:48:30
DERALD WING SUE Indigenous cultures do use prayer... (crosstalk) 

00:48:30
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:48:30
DERALD WING SUE ...as a healing mechanism. Or you, you know, even the reading of the Koran is frequently a, a part of, of healing but if you look at the definition of psychology, which is something that uhm, ah, I talked about at the ah, Roundtable, it is very Eurocentric. (crosstalk) 

00:48:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:48:45
DERALD WING SUE It defines psychology as a study of the mind or behavior and I think ah, Thomas Parham was the one who said that if you look at the origins of psychology, it originated from, what is it, African, Egyptian civilizations... (crosstalk) 

00:49:00
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:49:00
DERALD WING SUE ...in which it wa, was originally defined as a study of the soul and spirit. Uhm, and then if we look at what are the things that, that ah, currently we used to ascertain whether we are culturally competent? Well, they come from, let's say the ah, American Psychological Association Codes of Ethics... (crosstalk) 

00:49:20
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:49:20
DERALD WING SUE ...and the Standards of Practice. And both of those are culture bound. And I'll bet you, and that's why I'm fascinated with uhm, with Dr. Duran in, in this uhm, the video, with his service... (crosstalk) 

00:49:35
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:49:35
DERALD WING SUE ...that I'll bet you that much of what he does is inconsistent with uhm, many of the standards of practice... (crosstalk) 

00:49:40
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:49:40
DERALD WING SUE ...that our profession says... (crosstalk) 

00:49:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:49:45
DERALD WING SUE ..is represented of being a helping relationship. And those are, you know, as, as I mentioned uhm, a therapist or counselor who does not give advice and suggestions. (crosstalk) 

00:49:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:49:55
DERALD WING SUE A therapist or counselor who does not self-disclose her thoughts and feelings. (crosstalk) 

00:49:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:49:55
DERALD WING SUE  A therapist or a counselor does not serve a dual role relationship. (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:50:00
DERALD WING SUE  A therapist or uhm, a counselor does not accept gifts from client. (crosstalk) 

00:50:05
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:50:05
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Uh-huh. 

00:50:05
DERALD WING SUE  All of those therapeutic taboos that I've been looking at, uhm, many racial ethnic groups, and I know American-Indians would find those as healing conditions. 

00:50:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:50:20
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:50:20
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Uh-huh. Absolutely. 

00:50:20
DERALD WING SUE I mean, ah, that's where... (crosstalk) 

00:50:20
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:50:20
DERALD WING SUE ...I think that we also have to change the nature of, the, the field of psychology and what helping is all about because it has major implications. 

00:50:30
MICHEAL D'ANDREA The viewing audience of people who are gonna view this panel discussion... (crosstalk) 

00:50:35
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:50:35
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...I think should be reminded that there are people with courage that are saying, for better or worse, we're going to put together a new standards and practices to the best of our knowledge to heal people in a different way that reflects the re-traditionalization of our people. That's courage, to say we're gonna stand... (crosstalk) 

00:50:50
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:50:50
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...maybe in violation of Eurocentric ethics. 

00:50:55
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:50:55
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Derald, I know that your work with a number of groups and as ah, President of Division 45, now works inside APA... (crosstalk) 

00:51:00
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:51:00
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ..to help educate and transform that organization. So, you have Teresa and allies out here... (crosstalk) 

00:51:10
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:51:10
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Creating new systems... (crosstalk) 

00:51:10
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:51:10
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...in defiance of a tradition of racism and ethnocentrism. And then you have allies working in, and so, the viewing audience ought to know that they have a choice. They can join efforts to help create new forms of healing. (crosstalk) 

00:51:25
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:51:25
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:51:25
MICHEAL D'ANDREA And create organizational change or they can stand on the sidelines... (crosstalk) 

00:51:30
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:51:30
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...and watch stuff happen. But, we do know that if you're not part of the solution, you must be part of the problem. (crosstalk) 

00:51:35
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:51:35
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:51:35
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Where do you all see this going? And I guess I'm asking for myself and also, maybe the viewers would be interested in what your... (crosstalk) 

00:51:40
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:51:40
MICHEAL D'ANDREA  vision, where we're going. 

00:51:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:51:45
Teresa LaFromboise, Ph.D. Miami 

00:51:45
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Well, I would like to think that uhm, some community uhm, many uhm, community ah, service delivery systems that ah, might be looking ah, for models, could see some very important value... (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:52:05
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...in what has been developed, (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:52:05
TERESA LAFROMBOISE you know, with uhm, ah, at the Oakland Indian Health Clinic... (crosstalk) 

00:52:10
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:52:10
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...and see that, you know, it's, it's no longer ah, one or two lines in the text about alternative... (crosstalk) 

00:52:15
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:52:15
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:52:15
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...service delivery. These are real people, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:52:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:52:20
TERESA LAFROMBOISE explaining how this has affected their lives, the impact that is made on the utilization rates, et cetera. Uhm, and getting a sense of context and, and of the history with current you know, contemporary service delivery. (crosstalk) 

00:52:30
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:52:30
TERESA LAFROMBOISE So, I could see, I could see it is that. Uhm, I can also see that, I'm sure there are a lot of ah, uhm, native students that say uhm, because of having been adopted into white families, or because of having, through location, and through having their ge, generation buying into the acculturation process are not that knowledgeable... (crosstalk) 

00:52:55
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:52:55
TERESA LAFROMBOISE ...about their past and their history, feeling uhm, sort of a uhm, an encouragement to do so. (crosstalk) 

00:53:05
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:53:05
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:53:05
TERESA LAFROMBOISE I always say, it's never too late to learn. 

00:53:05
Madonna Constantine, Ph.D. 

00:53:05
MADONNA CONSTANTINE  I think that, the, the peace that I would really like to see, kind of the, the, ah, the film and, and even our discussion having a, an impact, would be to really challenge counselors and educators to look beyond traditional notions... (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Hmm. 

00:53:25
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...of, of healing... (crosstalk) 

00:53:25
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:53:25
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...and help. Because I think, even in my own experience, intellectually I can say, yeah, there's a need to uhm, incorporate culturally relevant interventions into kind of counseling relationships. But personally and professionally, I'd probably taken fewer risks... (crosstalk) 

00:53:45
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Hmm. 

00:53:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...in doing so, than I think that I would need to, or that I think would be important. 

00:53:50
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:53:50
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uhm, I, in, in courses I've talked about or even criticized this notion of the 50 minute hour. 

00:53:55
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Uh hmm. 

00:53:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE That in fact, there's that ah, part of counseling's very time bound, we see clients for 50 minutes or 45 minutes and then... (crosstalk) 

00:54:05
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:54:05
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...we schedule them for the appointment, same time next week and then so forth and so on. When I know, and I've worked with clients in the past where 45, 50 minutes was not enough time that we had... (crosstalk) 

00:54:15
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Hmm. Uh hmm. 

00:54:15
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...two hour sessions. And maybe we met, every two weeks or once a month or every week. You're just really depending on what the client needed. Uhm, I haven't felt that level of flexibility... (crosstalk) 

00:54:25
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:54:25
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...in a while, and when I felt empowered to do that... (crosstalk) 

00:54:30
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:54:30
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...it was in a place where there was, ah, I think(ph) a lot of respect and openness to... (crosstalk) 

00:54:35
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:54:35
MADONNA CONSTANTINE ...uhm, alternative ways of being as a counselor. (crosstalk) 

00:54:40
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. Uh hmm 

00:54:40
MADONNA CONSTANTINE And that's what I hope this, this can encourage. 

00:54:45
Derald Wing Sue, Ph.D. 

00:54:45
DERALD WING SUE You, you know, your question really brought to a forefront, uhm, ah, an issue that I thought about as you were talking, I think in the ah, earlier about the vision of what the society could be in terms of becoming, uhm, a much more multicultural that would be just ah, that would, that would have equal access and opportunity, uhm, you know, and, and that, that vision, is a vision that motivates many of, of us to continue doing what we do. Uhm, and not to, and I've said this before, not to put this on a, a downer, I'm not sure uhm, and I shouldn't say, I'm not sure that that vision is attainable. (crosstalk) 

00:55:25
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:55:25
DERALD WING SUE And thus, uhm, ah, for me and it, it is quite unique. Uhm, ah, what I do is as important as what can be attained in terms of the, ah, ultimate goal. That's the only way I keep going because uhm, to me multiculturalism is me, is part of my life. 

00:55:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:55:45
DERALD WING SUE The movement... (crosstalk) 

00:55:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:55:45
DERALD WING SUE ...and to be able to express it becomes extremely important in itself. Because it is an expression of your own integrity that, that goes on and I think that anything that uhm, ah, forces me or tries to prevent me from doing it, I stand against. 

00:56:00
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:56:00
DERALD WING SUE  Uhm, ah, truly so that, that's the thing that motivates me 'coz, ah, I, I used to go through this uhm, turmoil where I ask myself and lets deal with simply, with racism... (crosstalk) 

00:56:15
TERESA LAFROMBOISE Uh-huh. 

00:56:15
DERALD WING SUE ...whether we will ever eradicate racism... (crosstalk) 

00:56:15
MICHEAL D'ANDREA  Hmm. 

00:56:20
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:56:20
DERALD WING SUE ...and the answer I had was no. 

00:56:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Yeah. 

00:56:20
DERALD WING SUE Ah, but what does that mean? Ah, does that mean I become paralyzed? (crosstalk) 

00:56:25
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:56:25
DERALD WING SUE That it's, what's the worth? Ah, do I talk myself out of the job? You know, in terms of, (crosstalk) 

00:56:30
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:56:30
DERALD WING SUE of, of what I do and I, yo, you know, I, I went through a very depressed period until I realized ah, (crosstalk) 

00:56:35
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:56:35
DERALD WING SUE that the doing is as important as the outcome. 

00:56:40
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Yes. 

00:56:40
DERALD WING SUE And you know, Martin Luther King had a vision that he really believes strongly in. 

00:56:45
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:56:45
DERALD WING SUE Uhm, I'd like to share that vision but I'm not sure... (crosstalk) 

00:56:50
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:56:50
DERALD WING SUE ...that I buy into it as the ultimate goal because the goal is the doing itself... (crosstalk) 

00:56:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. 

00:56:55
DERALD WING SUE ...is, is, uhm, ah, important for me. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:56:55
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh hmm. The process? 

00:56:55
DERALD WING SUE Yes. 

00:56:55
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Uh hmm. 

00:56:55
DERALD WING SUE  Yeah. 

00:57:00
Michael D'Andrea, Ph.D. 

00:57:00
MICHEAL D'ANDREA Each time I hear you say that the ultimate goal of a just society may not be attainable or the full eradication... (crosstalk) 

00:57:05
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:57:05
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...of racism may not be attainable and it does resonate. And I can kinda empathize wh, wh, what you're thinking, what you're feeling. I still have to believe that racism and oppression are socially learned phenomenon that can be socially unlearned. 

00:57:20
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:57:20
MICHEAL D'ANDREA I, I tend to agree with Thomas Parham that the natural state of human beings is not to be oppressive, not to be exploitive, that's a bias... (crosstalk) 

00:57:30
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:57:30
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...no, none of us can prove that. I have a sense that part of your belief system is based upon the resistance that my group, ah, white brothers and sisters have historically imposed. And so, I guess my focus is really... (crosstalk) 

00:57:50
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:57:50
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...my family of white colleagues and students and wondering, how long it will take and how much more we can do as a cultural group to help contribute to a more just society? A society that, as you said... (crosstalk) 

00:58:05
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:58:05
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...it provides more equal access and at a bottom line, uhm, a sense of respect but then, at a final bottom line a sense of the spiritual awareness that we really are all connected. (crosstalk) 

00:58:15
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:58:15
MICHEAL D'ANDREA And I guess, I leave here today, kinda again, challenging ah, white graduate students, faculty ah, members, administrators ah, to help in whatever way they can at whatever level they can to dismiss the denial, to dismiss the anger, to let go of the bargaining and to look at ways that they can be, make a difference... (crosstalk) 

00:58:40
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:58:40
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...ah, as we go through this change. And I think I share a similar hopefulness as we do but know that the road is long and winding. (crosstalk) 

00:58:50
MADONNA CONSTANTINE Uh-huh. 

00:58:50
MICHEAL D'ANDREA But, the process as you talk about... (crosstalk) 

00:58:50
DERALD WING SUE Uh hmm. 

00:58:50
MICHEAL D'ANDREA ...is still very important. 

00:58:50
DERALD WING SUE  Yeah, amen, Michael.
