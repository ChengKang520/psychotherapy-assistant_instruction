DR. PAUL PELUSO So, a man walks into the therapy office. He sits down, he says I'm depressed doc. I, I just don't see much hope in life anymore. Things see, dark and I just don't feel the joy that I used to. The therapist says, I have a solution for you, he said, today, for one day only, Terrifeny, the great clown is in town, and I have heard that anybody that goes to see him, will immediately brighten up their day, and will change their outlook on life. The man stats to cry. He says, but doc. I'm Terrifeny! And so here you see the combination of both the comic and tragic. And humor and tragedy have always gone together. But there is also another connection point as well, and that is in psychotherapy. Now, thing about the ancient symbols for theater. It's one that everybody is familiar with, it's the two masks, you have the smiling mask for comedy, and the sad mask for tragedy. Uh, in fact, even in history, going back to Greek history, uh, they described tragedy and comedy as being related to one another. There were the goddesses of tragedy, and the goddess of comedy were sisters. Uh, they were daughters of Zeus. And in fat their mother was the goddess of memory. So, the tragic and the comic are rooted in memory. And actually, there is another good example of the tragic and comic is if I tried to say those names in the Greek, it would have been tragic for me and probably a little comedic for you. So, in this talk I want to talk a little bit about using humor in psychotherapy. Uh, and how practitioners can employ humor in order to bring about some successful changed in clients lives. Now, there's inherent danger to working with humor in psychotherapy. And actually it's the danger in trying to study humor in psychotherapy. In fact, EB White the writer said humor can be dissected as frog can. But in the process, the thing dies, and it's innards are discouraging to all but the pure scientific mind. So, I am going to try not to have too many frog innards in this uh, presentation as we talk about humor. But from a scientific stand point we do need to do a little bit of that. So let's start with another joke, shall we? Um, guy says, I once bet on a horse that went off 20 to one. It came in at 4:30. Now, what makes that humorous? Well, I thought it was funny. What makes it humorous is that there is two levels to the joke. There is the set up for it, which is, I once bet on a horse that went off at 20 to one. Now, if you're talking about horse betting, that means 20 to one odds, for every one dollar that you spend, for every one dollar that you bet, if your horse wins, then you get 20 dollars. But, then the second half of the joke, or the punch line comes in, but it didn't come in until 4:30. Which now begins to change that first sentence. It means that between 12:40 or I'm sorry between 20 to one, which is also 12:40, uh, and 4:30, it's almost four hours, which means the horse was so slow that it didn't finish the race for another almost four hours. So, that's where the joke comes in, because you have two different levels of logic, you have the one logic talking about the odds of the horse, and then you have the other logic talking about the speed of the horse. And that change in logic, that different levels of logic, is something that's called bi-association. And bi-association is when there is this collision of different meanings that produce a bunch of different results, mostly, humor. Um I know we are starting to get into the frog innards part here, trust me let's go with another joke, shall we? Um, how many psychotherapists does it take to change a lightbulb? One, but the lightbulb has to want to change. Now, what makes that joke humorous? Okay, probably not my delivery of it, but what makes that joke humorous is the fact that there is two different levels of logic, right? You have the lightbulb changing, well, how many people does it take to change a lightbulb? One. You reach up and they unscrew a burned out lightbulb, and replace it with another. But then the bi-association comes in with the ambiguous meaning of the word change. Well, psychotherapists deal with change, but we can actually change the client? No, the client has to want to change, and that's the punchline which then changed the meaning of that first sentence. And that's where the humor comes in, that's where the bi-association comes in. Oh, by the way, you want to know what is the best approach to use with lightbulbs? Electro shock therapy. Okay. Um, moving on. So, there's another element to humor. And it's very important for humor in psychotherapy, and that's the issue of time. Now, the Greeks actually have two different connotations for time. Two different constructs or concepts of time. The first was Chronos, and that was just your linear marking out of the hours in the day, and the days in the week. But then there was another element called Kyros. And Kyros means the appropriate time, the right time to uh, to do something, or say something. And that's an important part of humor as well, especially humor in psychotherapy. Timing the use of humor is going to be very important if it's going to successful or if it is going to come off appropriate for the client. Now, let's also talk about something related to timing, and it has to do with our own brains, and how they are wired for humor. Uh, now I know that brains, start to sound like frog innards, I'm not going to go in to all that, but neuroscience, uh, emerging research on neuroscience have actually found some related regions of the brain that they call the social brain network. Now, I know, that begins to sound like the potential next upgrade to Facebook, but I don't think it is. Uh, these are regions of the brain that have to deal with certain processing of different stimuli and different meanings. So, there is one region, one region that has to deal with empathy. And feeling, and being able to be sensitive to the feelings of other people. And, in the case where humor is being used, and jokes are being set up, uh that part of the brain tends to uh, become more active. There's another part of the brain that has to deal with uh, ambiguous stimuli, or uh, ambivalence. So again that bi-association, those two different levels of logic. Uh, and that begins to activate as well. And then, when there is the resolution of the tension, when the punchline comes, and when the humor comes, there is a release of dopamine. And it is the dopamine that gives you a kick of a reward, or it gives you some positive uh, benefit and association. And, if you think about what it is that we want to do with clients in therapy, we want to do those three things. We want to help them become more in tune with the uh, feelings of other people around them, get them out of themselves, and into the world of others. We want them to increase their tolerance for ambiguity, and ambivalence and be able to uh, tolerate that much more. And then lastly, we want them to derive some pleasure and some meaning out of uh, coming in for therapy, and the change in life. And that's also because there is another linkage in the use of humor, along with along with uh, pain, uh and then also uh, plays in with psychotherapy. And that has to do with the idea of pathos. Another Greek word, yes I know, we are moving from frog innards to a lesson on Greek, you didn't realize that that's what you were signing up for. Pathos, though, we know from the word psychopathology, or any kind of pathology. Usually means some sort of disease, but actually it's real meaning is pain. But pathos also has another meaning as well. It goes back to the idea of the theater again, and actors. And pathos was something that actors used when they uh, when they would be in a role and they would use great passion, and great emotion, and they would arose pathos in the audience, and move them form one place emotionally to another. And so, the linkage there again, is what humor does, what psychotherapy does, and moving that the client from a place of hurt and pain, to a place of healing, is what therapy does. There is also some special conditions where uh, psychotherapy is used. And that uh, is included in, excuse me, in the use of uh, paradoxical interventions. You know, what are paradoxical interventions? Well, like humor it has to do with incongruity. It has to deal with ambiguity, uh, it kind of reminds me of the old story of, uh, the, you know, the client who goes to his dentist. Dentist says, well your teeth are great, but your gums got to go. Now, what's the incongruity there? Well, if your tongue, if your teeth are good, but your gums are bad, well then it doesn't matter how good your teeth are. They are going to go. Uh it's kind of similar to what happens when uh, a person is at work and their boss calls them in and says, you know what, you've done a bang up job, you've probably been one of the most successful people, but we are closing your entire unit. So, pack your bags your fired. It's that incongruity that creates, again the conditions where uh, seeing something from a humorous perspective can alter uh, can alter their perceptions of it. so, it also reminds me of what the great Yogi Bear used to say, he's giving direction to his house one time, and he said you know what, when you see a fork in the road, take it. When we are dealing with clients and they are only looking at one way, and one way only of seeing things, then they are locking in. What we do in psychotherapy and what you can do with using humor in psychotherapy, is open that up a little bit, find another path, or another way of dealing with them. Um, kind of reminds me of another client who came to see me one time and said that she was having difficulty making friends, and keeping friends. So, I said to her well, reflectively, why do you think that is? She said I don't know why I can't keep friends, that's what I am hiring you for! You want me to do your job, you fat ugly slob? Okay, we are getting back to frog innards. Um, humor in psychotherapy can be used for a couple of important purposes. The first is going to be in building some report. In building that therapeutic relationship with, uh, with the client. And that can be very useful in the beginning phases of therapy but, you also have to be very cautious using that in the beginning phases of therapy. Usually the best kind of humor to use in those situations is self deprecating humor. The humor that focuses more on the self. You've seen a couple of examples of that here. It tells the client that you don't take yourself all that seriously, although you should take the work very seriously. Uh, it also communicates to the client that it's okay to be a little more freewheeling, and creates a space in therapy for some playfulness. And playfulness is important for generating new ideas and being open to new experiences. When we are locked down in a closed framework, and a close minded way of seeing things, change really can't occur. Humor helps to open up that playfulness and helps to open up the uh, the therapy for different interpretations and for different elements to come in. You know, one time there was a man, who was uh, traveling on a country road. And uh, he came upon a pig. It was a pig that had a wooden leg. And the farmer was there, and he goes up to the farmer and he says, I couldn't help but notice you had a pig there with a wooden leg. Farmer says yeah, yeah that's some pig. He goes well, I'm wondering how he got that wooden leg. And the farmer says well, let me tell you about this pig, one time my daughter was down by the river and she fell in, and she didn't know how to swim. The pig in, grabbed her by the scruff of her neck, and pulled her out to safety. Saved her life. The guy says, wow that's incredible, is that how he lost his leg? He says no, no, no, no, no, I'll tell you another story about this pig, see the pig smelled smoke in our house, and out barn house was on fire. And uh, I was asleep and my wife was unconscious and the pig dragged me out of the fire, and then he dragged my wife out of the fire, and he gave her mouth to mouth resuscitation, and the traveler said, that's incredible, so is that how the pig lost his leg? And the farmer said, no. huh, a pig like that you don't eat it all at once. Okay, when not to use humor in psychotherapy. I think there are a couple of really important considerations to take, in terms of when not to use humor in psychotherapy. Uh, the first is, when the issues that are coming in are uh, are so dire and so uh, discouraging, that again, you want to make sure that humor doesn't sound like you are uh, laughing at the person, uh, rather than trying to open them up for new ways of seeing things. Um, there is problems sometimes working with children and humor. Uh, so they may not quite understand the different types of humor that you use. Humor should be sarcastic or mocking. At least to the clients. Maybe the client's in-laws, possibly but that's a different talk all together. Uh, and then lastly, humor should never be used to denigrate the client. It should always be used to lift up the client. One more story, so, a guy was walking on a beach in Hawaii. And, up washed a magic lantern and he picks it up, and he rubs the magic lantern, and all of a sudden a genie pops out. And the genie says, ah, I have been trapped for a thousand years, thank you for freeing me. And because of that I am going to grant you one wish. Anything to your heart's content. The man thought about it for a second, and he said you know what? I am here in Hawaii, but I sure would love to drive my car from here to California. Is there any way that you could build be a bridge from here to California? The genie said, are you mad? Do you understand what that would take? All the material and all of the concrete, and all of the maintenance, no, no, there is no way that I can build you a bridge from Hawaii, to California. It's out of the question, chose something else. So the man thinks for a second. He says, you know what? I am a psychotherapist, and I would love to be able to understand my clients better, I'd love to be able to know their wishes, and their dreams, and their hopes and their fears. I would like to know how to treat them better. To be more effective with them, and if only I could understand their thinking then, then, I could be a truly great clinician. The genie looked at the man and said, would that be two lanes or four on the bridge? So, hopefully, I have given you a little bit of information on the use of humor in psychotherapy. Uh, we've talked a little bit about some of the different ways that the brain processes humor, and how that is related structurally to pain, and how that is related structurally to tragedy as well as comedy in uh, in the use of psychotherapy. So uh, thank you very much, uh, I am here all week. Please tip your waitresses, and try the veal.

00:18:20
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Dr. Peluso, thank you. I have to say, that was probably one of my favorite talks. I uh, despite the bad humor, but I actually am a fan of bad humor. But, um, I- 

00:18:30
DR. PAUL PELUSO So are my students. Or they are if they know what's good for them. 

00:18:35
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D That's right, if they want the A, they are. Um, I always think of my students as a captive audience. 

00:18:40
DR. PAUL PELUSO Yeah, well I am actually feeling really charmed because um, you know in the old days on the Tonight Show, if a comedian did well, uh, Johnny Carson would call them over to the couch, and it usually meant that their career was going to take off. So, I am assuming that's what this is. 

00:18:55
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Right. 

00:18:55
DR. PAUL PELUSO No?, no. 

00:18:55
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:18:55
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D No, I don't have that kind of power. But um, who knows I think your career is already pretty good thought, probably. But I have been, well, first of all I love bad humor. When I said that, I love puns, plays on words, things like that. I am not a big fan of the slapstick humor. But I do enjoy it, one of my favorite movies is Young Frankenstein, which is filled with puns. So I really, and I have always been interested in humor, how to use it and how to not use in um, counseling or therapy especially. So uh, what made you chose this topic? 

00:19:30
Paul Peluso, Ph.D. 

00:19:30
DR. PAUL PELUSO Well, I, I just completed a book, actually it's a revision to a book, and my co-authors and I included humor as a special case of paradoxical intervention. Because it fits in so nicely with that. Again, I talked about you know, the different levels of logic, and how uh, kind of fracturing that logic through the use of humor opens up new possibilities. And honestly, paradoxical interventions do that in a parallel way uh, as humor does, So I think it really is sort of a special case of that. 

00:20:00
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D That's really interesting cuz I never thought of paradoxical interventions in that way. But it makes sense now that you said it. In paradox your giving a different frame to something reframing it. and in a lot of ways giving it different meaning, and your right, that's what some of the best humor does. It makes you think you're going this way, and then all of a sudden reframes it. 

00:20:15
DR. PAUL PELUSO Exactly, and then there's that level of the absurdity that also goes into it. I mean, a paradox, by definition are two things that cant logically co-exist and yet they do. 

00:20:30
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Very good. So you know of course, I am going to have to tell my favorite bad therapy joke. 

00:20:35
DR. PAUL PELUSO You have to, yeah. 

00:20:35
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D I have to. So, uh, a psychiatrist says this next case coming in, and the receptionist tells him, well this is a man who is suffering from you know, delusions. And he says okay, so the guy comes in, and he sits down, and he goes, I am a wigwam I am teepee, I am a wigwam, I am a teepee. And the psychiatrist says, see there's your problem, your two tents. 

00:20:50
DR. PAUL PELUSO Be dum dum. I like that. 

00:20:55
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D That's a bad one. But, but, um, so tell me, what um, you've been, you're a supervisor, and I don't know, you may or may not have any examples of this, what might be the worst use of humor that you have seen uh, one of your trainees or a colleague uh, do? 

00:21:10
DR. PAUL PELUSO Students, I think students learn very well from us, that unless they are very, very confident they shouldn't try humor. Um, and so I don't see a lot of students trying it out. At least early on. Maybe as they get you know, a little bit older. But I know that in supervision I think it's helpful to try to see some of the you know, the different or humorous sides to situations. Again you got to be careful, you don't want to be mocking or critical of the client, but um, you know, when we've talked about using paradoxical interventions, or some humorous intervention with a client, it is a way of opening it up. Um, and you know I am reminded of one client of mine, this is actually a client, I am not setting up a joke, um, who you know was going to get married for the third time, and he said well, what can I say doc, I am a hopeless romantic. Although, this time, I probably should give her the house first, and half my bank account, cuz that's the way it usually winds up. Um, and I think when clients come in, you know, with that level of humor, and playfulness, again I think the playful frame is the important thing, um, it does allow for therapy to go in different directions. Uh, and bring up new possibilities. So I always like that. 

00:22:25
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Well, some of my favorite moments when I am seeing clients, are when we've used humor. Although I do, I do know I have to monitor myself to make sure I am not baling them out of a, an emotional or difficult situation through the humor by uh, distracting them with the humor. 

00:22:40
DR. PAUL PELUSO Clinical judgement is an absolute must. Uh, and I think that it's important to be able to time it correctly. That was the whole you know, piece on kyros. The right time, you know, you tell a joke too early in therapy, it's going to go bad, you tell it too late, it's going to go bad, or if you just tell it like I do, it's going to go bad. So, one of those things. 

00:23:05
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Right. I um, I have to say I haven't seen too many supervisees use a lot of um, humor in counseling or therapy, what I have seen, where it can go bad is actually, outside of the therapy room. When I think sometimes we um, as I think doctors, therapists, counselors, social workers, anyone who is constantly seeing the pain of others, sometimes uses humor in order to, from getting burnt out, or to make it through these tough things. And people can perceive it as, I think you said, you know, unsympathetic or mocking of clients, when really, it's not about your clients, it's about keeping you, protecting yourself. 

00:23:40
DR. PAUL PELUSO Yeah. The, there is you know, gallows humor which can be helpful and useful if the client is going to use it to be able to talk about their experiences. I have had you know, clients use the old line uh, when they are in a difficult situation, you know, other than that Mrs. Lincoln, what did you think of the play? you know. 

00:24:00
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Wow that is bad. That is callous. 

00:24:05
DR. PAUL PELUSO Yeah, it's definitely gallows humor. Especially when you feel like there is nothing I can do to change the situation. You know, let me look at the absurd side of things. And sometimes that's when I can be helpful and useful. But I think in the situation your talking about, uh, yeah, I think as a supervisor, then I would be focusing more on issues of burn out and looking at you know, what are the underlying uh, things that might be going on there, uh, that makes you want to depersonalize a person. That's when humor becomes depersonalizing and that is something that's never going to be beneficial therapeutically. 

00:24:35
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Yeah. Um, I find that one of the classes that I teach where we use the most humor, maybe you can guess it, uh, is sex therapy. 

00:24:40
DR. PAUL PELUSO Oh, yeah. 

00:24:40
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D One because its ripe for lots of innuendos and plays on words, but two I think it's such an anxiety producing topic for some people. And that they do take it um, maybe too seriously. So, I know we use, I use humor when I teach it, one two sort of release some of the tension, um, but two, also you mentioned it, playfulness part of great sex is having some flexibility, and playfulness. I was going to make a joke there, but in playfulness that's um, when people start to have sexual problems they become too serious about it and they get, you know, then they have that observer effect, of themselves, and they lose some of that spontaneity, and playfulness. Um, so I see, what other topic areas do you think that people tend to use humor successfully? Or do you have any specific topic areas? 

00:25:30
Dr. Paul Peluso 

00:25:30
DR. PAUL PELUSO I found that you know, folks in recovery, substance abuse recovery, tend to use humor a lot. And you hear a lot of you know, you hear a lot of the funny absurd stories when they kind of, war story about things that happen in the past. But I think that in the 12 step tradition, there seems to be a lot of, you know, kind of humorousness to uh, you know, to recovery. And I think it's exactly as you were saying. Uh, it's a way of kind of, connecting with the pain, but not necessarily dwelling in the pain. It's a kind of healing bomb or a healing sav that you can you know, put on, on a open wound. Uh, so you see it a lot in that context. Um, you have to be cautious using it in family therapy context, because usually there is a you know, a target to the joke, and that can always be difficult. Uh, and for me then, you know, I would much rather be the target, I would, you might have noticed in the talk, I don't mind making fun of myself. I, if people are going to laugh, I want them to laugh at me first. Uh, because that tells them it's okay. It's okay to do this. Um, but yeah, you never want to get into that hurtful area. 

00:26:40
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D 

00:26:40
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D I'm glad you brought up family therapy, or couples counseling, or couples therapy, when it's one thing to have one person in the room, and use humor, it's another level when you have multiple people in there, because you have to think about multiple alliances and multiple perspectives on how they are going to perceive it. 

00:27:00
DR. PAUL PELUSO And to that point, something that I didn't mention, but definitely could have and should have, is you know the issue of uh, cultural variations with humor. Uh, you know, not all uh, folks interpret humor in the same way, depending on their culture of origins. So I think you always want to be sensitive to that, uh, and kind of let the client lead you uh, in that way. So, sometimes I will wait for the client to tell the first joke, if uh, you know, I sense that there may be some sensitivity around that and then you know, we can lighten up. I can lighten up the mood in other ways, and again, if I am telling jokes about myself, that's a little bit easier to do. But yeah, that's a cautionary note that needs to be needs to be struck. 

00:27:45
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D I am glad you also mentioned children, actually when I have gotten in trouble in humor, its usually with telling jokes with children, because they don't get the double meaning. Like I said, some kid was acting out one time while playing a sport, I mean, when he was playing soccer, and I said, and I was teasing him about not being a good sport, and so then he went baseball, and I went huh? And he was like naming off multiple good sports, and the mother was like mm mm mm. cuz they don't get it, the double meaning of things which is a big part of a lot of humor. So, that's usually where I get into trouble, is uh, if I am trying to use that type of humor versus a more basic or sometimes slapstick humor with kids. 

00:28:20
DR. PAUL PELUSO Yeah, of course when you get to adolescent humor, any kind of potty humor we usually go over well. 

00:28:25
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D It does, yeah. 

00:28:30
DR. PAUL PELUSO Might not want to advocate for that, but I'm just saying. It's just out there. 

00:28:30
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D Well, good. I would love to talk about this more, but we are running out of time, so I need to wrap this up. And I wish I had a good joke to end with, but I don't. um, but thank you again. 

00:28:40
DR. PAUL PELUSO Two therapists go into a bar oh, we are out of time. 

00:28:45
SHANNON DERMER, PH.D We're out of time, oh you missed the uh, punchline. But thank you for your talk, and thank you for joining us. Um, please visit the alexander street press site for more information on these talks, and more about Dr. Peluso um, and thanks again for a great talk.
