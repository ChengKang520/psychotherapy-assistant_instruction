Therapeutic Limit Setting in Play Therapy Purpose, Areas and ACT Model Dr. Garry Landreth Distinguished Contributor to Play Therapy 

00:00:00
NARRATOR This hour-long training session was a part of one of Dr. Landreth's two-day workshops on making contact with children through play therapy. In this video Dr. Landreth describes the purposes for setting limits, area where limits are needed, his ACT model of limit setting, and how to help children develop self-control. He also shares case examples of setting limits in play therapy and examines the therapist's inner struggle in setting limits. Dr. Gary Landreth is a regent's professor and founder and director of the Center for Play Therapy at the University of North Texas, the largest play therapy training program in the world. Dr. Landreth is internationally recognized as one of the foremost spokesman for and developer of the child centered approach to play therapy. He has pioneered child centered therapy training in international settings such as China, Korea, and South Africa and is a frequent conference speaker and workshop presenter throughout the Unites States. Dr. Landreth's over 100 publications and videos include his book "Play Therapy The Art of the Relationship" which is widely considered to be the authoritative source on child centered play therapy and has been published in Chinese, Korean, and Russian. His video "Child Centered Play Therapy a Clinical Session" demonstrates his approach to play therapy. 

00:01:35
DR. GARRY LANDRETH I think maybe this would be a good time to work on therapeutic limit setting. Um, therapeutic limit setting is the most difficult thing that play therapists engage in. It's potentially the most frustrating thing that play therapists engage in because it touches play therapists in their heart and soul and touches a point in play therapists lives that we need to be aware of and take care of a head of time. And what it touches is we would like to be liked by the child. And if I set a limit on the child, this little girl might not like me as much if she doesn't get to do everything that she wants to in here. But there reasons why limits are needed and to be consistent in setting therapeutic limits, you need to have a rationale for setting the limits. That is, what are the reasons why you set limits? If you don't have those firmly fixed in your mind, you will be erratic and inconsistent in setting limits. You'll set a limit on that behavior this time and next week you don't set a limit on that behavior and then the relationship is not predictable. Folks, whatever happens in this session today, it will be that way next week. Whatever we set a limit on today, we set a limit on next week. So let's review some, some of the reasons why we set limits in play therapy. 

00:03:15
Therapeutic Limit Setting Purpose: Protect Child, Therapist, Materials 

00:03:15
DR. GARRY LANDRETH We set limits to protect the child, the therapist, and the materials. We would not allow the child to harm us. We would not allow the child to harm themselves and we would not allow the child to indiscriminately break items in the playroom. There are rules in the playroom. And that covers three of the areas there. Um, I would not allow a child to strike me with, um, a hammer, I would not allow a child to pour, uh, paint over my head, I would not allow a child to do any kind of harm to themselves. We'll talk in a few minutes about how to set the limits. I know you're already thinking about that but let's first get fixed in our minds, um, the purposes for the limits. The purpose is to protect us, the child, and the materials. 

00:04:20
Therapeutic Limit Setting Purpose: Protect Child, Therapist, Materials Help Child Feel Secure 

00:04:25
DR. GARRY LANDRETH We set limits to help children to feel secure. You cannot feel secure in a relationship where there are no boundaries. Relationships that have no boundaries probably have little value. And I'm not just talking about play therapy folks. All relationships that have no boundaries, if you do not value yourself enough to have some boundaries about yourself, how can you expect other people to value you? 

00:05:00

00:05:00
Therapeutic Limit Setting Purpose: Protect Child, Therapist, Materials Help Child Feel Secure Consistent 

00:05:05
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Limits promote consistency because we're always setting limits in the same kind of way and we set limits on the same kinds of behaviors. 

00:05:10
Therapeutic Limit Setting Purpose: Protect Child, Therapist, Materials Help Child Feel Secure Consistent Predictable 

00:05:15
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Therefore, this becomes a predictable relationship Consistency promotes predictability. Predictablilty promotes security. So we help the child to feel secure in this relationship with us by the way we set the limits, and the manner in which we set the limits. Security frees the child. When the child feels secure, they become more creative.They become more self-directing, they initiate more behaviors, um, their symbolic world emerges much more fully when they feel secure. Things they need to share are more likely to come out because they feel secure in the relationship with you. 

00:06:05
Therapeutic Limit Setting Purpose: Protect Child, Therapist, Materials Help Child Feel Secure Consistent Predictable Security Promote Therapist Acceptance 

00:06:10
DR. GARRY LANDRETH We set limits to promote therapist acceptance. I don't know about you folks but for me I have great difficulty maintaining a high level of acceptance of the source of my pain. A child's hitting me over the knee with a hammer. My knee is sending up signals to my brain saying, "look down here. He's killing me.'' I, I'm gonna have a hard time maintaining and accepting attitude of this child who is hitting me on the knee and causing severe pain. So we set limits to promote our own acceptance of the child. Uh, red paint running down my face is going to bother my level of acceptance, so I'm going to set limits on that. A child is doings something that, uh, I'm feeling awkward about because, gee, that child might get hurt. And if I'm feeling awkward about it, I think the child will sense that and how will the child internalize what they sense? As rejection of them. But it's my problem, so I need to set a limit so I can maintain a high level of acceptance of the child. 

00:07:30
Therapeutic Limit Setting Facilitate Development of Child's Decision Making 

00:07:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH We set limits to facilitate development of the child's decision making. And it is the way we set the limit that allows the child to make a decision. We're not the ones to control the child's behavior in the playroom. We want to respond to the child in a way that allows the child to control self, to make a decision about what is about to happen. 

00:08:00
Therapeutic Limit Setting Facilitate Development of Child's Decision Making Self-Control Self-Responsibility 

00:08:00
DR. GARRY LANDRETH So we avoid saying to children in the playroom, "Don't do that'! Stop that! Quit that!" because that puts us in control and does not allow the child to accept, uh, responsibility for making a decision, bringing self under control, and assuming responsibility for doing so. It is the way we set the limit that allows the child to assume the responsibility. If I tell the child, "stop that," then I'm in control. I leave the child no opportunity to experience the opportunity to make a decision and then assume responsibility. 

00:08:45
Therapeutic Limit Setting Facilitate Development of Child's Decision Making Self-Control Self-Responsibility Protect Child From Guilt 

00:08:45
DR. GARRY LANDRETH We set limits to protect the child from guilt. If a child is allowed to shoot you with a dart, uh, they may go home and, uh feel guilty about having shot you or that they've done you great harm. Or a child is allowed to pour paint or paint your face blue, let's say. Then the child goes home and has these awful thoughts about, "What if the blue never comes off, and she's got a blue face forever." Um, or you allow a child to, uh , tie a rope around your neck and pull it tightly. Then later the child thinks, "Gee, maybe I strangled her.'' Uh, remember children are not real rational in their thinking. Then next week you have the flu bug and you have to miss the session and you call in cancel and then the child thinks, "I did it, I did it." Remember children are egocentric. I think it, it happens. Um, do you remember some of those thoughts you had as a child and, um, Mrs. Brown, uh, your first grade teacher reprimanded you for something in the classroom and you wished she was dead? And the next day she was sick and didn't show up and you feel, "I killed her. I killed her." Um, children internalize that, things that way because of their egocentricity. So we want to respond to children by setting limits so that they will not feel guilty. 

00:10:30
Therapeutic Limit Setting Facilitate Development of Child's Decision Making Self-Control Self-Responsibility Protect Child From Guilt Anchor Session to Reality 

00:10:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH We set limits to anchor the session to reality. This could be a pure fantasy experience in the playroom without the setting of limits, but once you set a limit, this experience is, is now suddenly yanked into reality. Here and now and an issue between me and the child. It can no longer be fantasy once you set the limit. So this helps to keep children grounded. Those of you who have children in your play therapy experiences who have trouble being grounded; this is the best way to ensure that they stay grounded. Don't avoid setting limits. Now I'm not implying you should go around just setting limits indiscriminately in order to accomplish that, but don't hesitate to set a limit if there is an opportunity and the limit is needed , set it. 

00:11:30
Therapeutic Limit Setting Facilitate Development of Child's Decision Making Self-Control Self-Responsibility Protect Child From Guilt Anchor Session to Reality 

00:11:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH If you don't set the limit, think about it, if you don't set the limit and the limit is needed, you deprive the child of an opportunity to learn some important dimensions called decision making, self-control, self-responsibility. So there's good reason for setting the limits. I really wanna give you good encouragement with that as I've supervised hundreds of beginning play therapists. I find that this the area that they struggle with most, setting limits. Um, they'll come out of the play room, I sit down with them and many times I've had beginning play therapists say, "I know," before I even get started, "I should've set some limits. Next time I'll try...'' and then we start exploring well why didn't you? "Well she's such a sweet little thing." Folks that's not a good reason for not setting the limits. Uh, children learn to do things in those kinds of relationships we don't want them to learn and it's called manipulation. So if the limits are needed, set the limits. There actually are not very many areas where we set limits. Those are the purposes for setting the limits, but the, the places where we set the limit are very few and here they are. 

00:12:55
Areas of Limit Setting Harmful or Dangerous Behavior To Child To Therapist 

00:13:00
DR. GARRY LANDRETH We set limits on harmful or dangerous behavior to the child and to the therapist. Those are the areas. I'm not going to allow a child to harm me; I'm not going to allow a child to harm self. Even if I have to do something physically. A child has the hammer. They're standing right there in front of me and they're threatening to hit me and their arm is coming down rapidly. Uh, I'm not going to smile at the child and say, "You'd like to hit me". I'm gonna grab the child's hand quickly, stop the child, look the child in the eye, and say, "I know you'd like to hit me, but I'm not for hitting. You can choose to hit the bobo. You can pretend the bobo is me and hit the bobo," but I'm not going to allow this to happen if I can stop it. The same thing would be true for the child if the child is about to do harm to themselves. Folks I'm going to do whatever I can to protect this child. I'm not going to sit passively in my chair if the child is about to do great harm to themselves with a pencil or um, or drinking out of an old rusty tin can. I would not allow those kinds of things to happen. 

00:14:20
Areas of Limit Setting Harmful or Dangerous Behavior To Child To Therapist Behavior that disrupts the Therapeutic Routine or Process Continually leaving playroom 

00:14:25
DR. GARRY LANDRETH The second area where west limits is on behavior that disrupts the therapeutic routine or process, such as continually leaving the play room. We would not allow the child to go in and out of the door of the play room and run down the hall and come back whenever they choose to. That disrupts the therapeutic process to run in and out. Um, if the child's not ready to stay in the room, today then we need to reschedule, uh, and I'll talk about how to respond in a moment to the child who wants to go in and out of the playroom, but let's get the principles down first. No continually running in and out of the playroom. Uh, in a few cases, I might allow the child to leave the door open, but those would be very rare happenings. This is a private relationship and what I would hope to uh facilitate in this relationship is not likely to happen if the door to the play room is open because there are people going by, there are noises out there, there always the potential of some one walking in or the child feeling afraid someone is gonna run in. So I think its important that the door be closed. Now I don't mean I would never allow the child out of the playroom. If the child needs to go the bathroom, we're going out to the bathroom. If they need to go down the hall to get a drink of water, we're going down there to get a drink of water, but this running in and out we would set a limit on. I'll come back to that. 

00:16:05
Areas of Limit Setting Harmful or Dangerous Behavior To Child To Therapist Behavior that disrupts the Therapeutic Routine or Process Continually leaving playroom Wanting to play after time is up 

00:16:10
DR. GARRY LANDRETH We would set a limit on wanting to play after time is up. When time is up, time is up. It's time to leave. Now I don't mean by that that we grab the child and run out of the playroom. We continue our patience with the child who is reluctant to leave at the end of this wonderful playtime and that can be very trying for you folks. Um, because you've got another child waiting down in the waiting room and you're gonna want to rush it but continue to be patient. If it takes five minutes for the child to take themselves out of the playroom , that's five minutes well spent. Now that five minutes can seem like 35 minutes. Um, I was just thinking about a five-year-old little girl named Cindy. When I said, "Cindy, we have five more minutes in the playroom," she looked up and said, "I'm not leaving". I didn't even get to finish my statement, and then we'll go down to the... She just said, "I'm not leaving.'' This was a very manipulative, I'm sorry she wasn't five, she was four years old. Uh, very manipulative child, that's the reason she had been referred. Um, at the uh, when it was time to go, I looked at my watch and I said, "Cindy our time is up for today," and I stood up. Folks you give two messages when it's time to leave. You don't remain seated, look at your watch, stay in your seat, and say, "Our time is up for today." The child looks at y you and thinks, "It's not really," and then they go back to playing. So you give a verbal message that the time is up and you give a visual message that time is up. And I stood up and Cindy looked at me and said, "I told you I'm not leaving," and I said, "Oh you'd like to be the one to decide just how long you get to stay," and she said, "right" , like, "you got it buster." And I took a step toward the door. You don't give all your cues away. You don't just walk to the door and open the door; you've given all your cues away. I'm talking about how to respond to reluctant children folks. You take a step towards the door and you turn and you look expectantly , and I said to her, "I know you'd like to stay longer Cindy, but our time really is up for today,'' and she said, "I've got to do some art." and she quickly thought of some art she had to do and ran over and started doing some things. And I said, "I know that's important for you to do but our time is up for today,'' and I took another step towards to the door. It took me about five minutes to get to the door and then you crack the door and open it a little bit and this five or six minutes now was feeling like 47 minutes to me because I'm feeling a lot of pressure. I've got 20 graduate students on the other side of the two-way mirror watching this session and I know what they're wondering: "What's Garry gonna do next?" And I'm wondering, "What's Garry gonna do next?'' Uh, I'm not quite sure how this is gonnna play out, but I was determined that this four-year-old child was not going to manipulate me into dragging her out of the play room. That's why she was referred in the first place because of all this manipulation. So I was very patient with her and after about seven minutes, she finally took herself out of the play room. On the way home, this four year old child was sitting beside her mom, mom reported this later, and she said to her mom, "I kinda like that place. He wouldn't make me leave, so I had to make myself." Insight, tremendous insight on the part of a four-year-old. Children know what they're doing folks, they know what they're doing, but we must still be patient with them. Oh on, on the responding to time is up, uh, its best to not to use a timer to indicate time is up. And the reason for that is, this is a time when you are in charge, you are in charge, you are in the lead. Up to this point the child has been in the lead and we've been working hard to keep the child tin the lead. Now you're in charge. Time is up and the responsibility for that gets confused and displaced if you bring a timer in because I know what the tendency is. The child's really having fun and the timer goes off and the child goes, "Awww ," and I know what the tendency is. You wanna say, "Aww gee, the timer went off. The dumb old timer's gonna make us leave." No, it's, "The time is up and I'm I charge now and it is time to leave.'' This now becomes an issue between me and the child not between the child and the timer. You see the difference folks? I don't wanna confuse that part of the relationship so leave your timers out of the uh, out of the playroom. 

00:21:40
Therapeutic Limit Setting Destruction of Room or Play Materials 

00:21:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH We will set a limit on destruction of the room or playing materials. with the exception as I mentioned earlier of some items that a child can destroy such as egg cartons, they can be destroyed, but the other items, it doesn't matter if it's a $0.29 plastic truck. It's not for stomping. The egg carton is for stomping. Um , the dolls head is not for yanking off. I don't care if it only cost a dollar or if it costs $29, that's not the issue. The doll's head is not for yanking off. Uh, "You can make a doll out of the play-dough and yank the head off, but that doll's head is not for yanking off." You see we're taking advantage of the opportunity to help the child to learn self-control, and to bring self under control. 

00:22:40
Therapeutic Limit Setting Destruction of Room or Play Materials Taking Toys from Playroom 

00:22:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH We would set a limit on taking toys from the playroom. The toys are like the child's words so if you allow a child to take a toy, you've allowed the child to take some words away from the play room and the next child is deprived of that. the other reason for not taking items away is that communicates the wrong message to the child. The child wants to take something away to remember you by. This is an emotional relationship not based on any tangible item and, and folks I know children can tug at your heartstrings. A deprived little boy picks up the little blue car and says, "I never had a car like this in my whole life. Could I please just take this home and play with it? I'll bring it back next time," and I know what your heart is wanting to say, "Sure David take the blue car and you want the red one and the yellow one too? You can have all three of them." But this is a relationship based on emotional issues, not something tangible. Uh, folks, the child does not need some tangible item to remember you by, not even at the end of the session. The child does not need a smiley face stamped on the back of their hand. They don't need a sticker stuck on the back of their hand. They don't need uh, uh, a sucker to walk out with that they choose out of a bowl on the way. They don't need those rewards for having been here. What the child carries away in his or her heart , is more important that anything the child can carry away in their hand. Think about it folks. Any thing you can hold in your hand can be lost. What you hold in your heart can never be lost, never. You can, there is not a store anywhere that you can buy anything, I don't care how big the diamond is, it is not as valuable as what you hold in your heart. And that's what we want children growing up with and learning in this relationship . It's how we feel about each other. It's what we think about each other. It's what's in our hearts. As the tin man said in the Wizard of Oz, "I'd much rather have a heart," and it's what we hold in our hearts that impact s children, and we want children to discover that in the relationship . So we would say to a child who wants to take the blue car home, "The toys are for staying in the play room so they will be here when you come back next time." That shows great consideration for the child, looking ahead, "so they will be here when you come back next time." We would not respond this way, "The blue car is for staying in the play room," because what will the child do next? Pick up the yellow car then you set a limit on the yellow car and then they pick up the red car and you set a limit on the red car. So it's the toys, the toys are for staying in the playroom until you, so they'll be here when you come back next time. I just hesitated because fleeting through my mind was, there is one thing that a child can take home, their artwork. We would allow a child to take their paintings home if they want to. If you would like to have a copy of the child's artwork for your files, and that sometimes can be very helpful in terms of reading themes, in terms of art expression, then you might want to say to the child, I'd like for you to l-, to leave your painting with me until next week and take it home next week. In the meantime, you take a photograph of the artwork and you put the photograph in the folder. Um, even if a child doesn't take their artwork home, the photographs in the folder take up less space than all these folded up pieces of artwork that are messy anyway, you don't have room for all of that. Uh, jesting aside folks, um that's something you can do at home. Those of you who have children, important pieces of artwork and other items get put on the refrigerator door. What do you do when the refrigerator door gets full? You take a picture of the refrigerator door, put the picture on the refrigerator door and start over and it's still all there, you see? 

00:27:25
Therapeutic Limit Setting Destruction of Room or Play Materials Taking Toys from Playroom Socially Unacceptable Behavior 

00:27:25
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Um, we would set limits on socially unacceptable behavior. No urinating in the sand box, there's one place for using the bathroom and that's in the bathroom. No undressing in the playroom, socks and shoes off, that's okay. Uh folks, 15 years ago that didn't bother me at all if a child stripped off to their shorts. It does bother me a lot now because of the potential for a lawsuit um, and so you have to be very careful about that. Um, if a child wants to take their shoes off to play in the sand box, that's okay but going beyond that, can lead to problems. I have a, had a master's student last year, bless her heart; it was her first supervised experience in the playroom. It, it's, uh, late, early summer and the child came in a sundress and sandals, and she came in, she was three years old, just this eager vivacious little child. She came eagerly into the playroom and the play therapist barely got to introduce her to the play room, and the child kicked off her sandals and had her dress off and had her pants off and was stark naked, and my play therapist was going, "uh, uh." I thought she was gonna have a heart attack. She quickly composed herself and she said, "Uh, your pants, your pants are for putting on right now. The pants go on right now'', and she began to calm herself down, "The pants go on right now.'' And the child put her pants on she said, "and your dress is for putting on right now. The dress is not for taking off in the play room. Shoes are for taking off in the play room, not your dress" and the child get dressed again . But I thought I was about to lose a play therapist there. Um, so we would not allow children to undress, but other than that and where they would urinate, um, can't think of many other socially unacceptable, uh, things, except um , in um, in cases of group play therapy, we would not allow racial slurs. Other than that, children can say anything they wanna say in the play room. No restrictions on noise, no restrictions on yelling, no restrictions on any verbal expression, cuss words, I've learned new cuss words from five-year-olds that I've never heard before. Unless, those of you who are elementary counselors, if your play room is next to the principal's office, you set limits on noise, you set limits on verbal expressions. Otherwise the principal is likely to toss your play therapy program out the window because they hear all this stuff right next door. Uh, so, in that case I would set limits, but barring that we would not set limits on children's verbal behavior. 

00:30:55
Therapeutic Limit Setting Destruction of Room or Play Materials Taking Toys from Playroom Socially Unacceptable Behavior Inappropriate Displays of Affection 

00:30:55
DR. GARRY LANDRETH We set limits on inappropriate displays of affection. Uh, I would not allow a child to kiss me on the mouth. It has romantic connotations. If they want to kiss me on the cheek, that's okay. Um, if a child wants to hop up in my lap and lean against me, that's OK. I'm gonna reach out and love this child. If a child walks over beside my chair and leans against me as they often do I'll reach out and put my arm around the child, but I wait for the child to initiate that. If a child hops up in my lap and begins to squirm around inappropriately, I would gently set the child on the floor and if this happens again, child hops up in my lap as I set the child gently on the floor this second time, I would add, "That's not for in the play room." I'd like not to make a big issue out of that. I don't want the child to feel, um, rejected or threatened by ,um their need or their expression and my reaction to it. I'd like to respond to that in the same way I would if the child is pouring sand on the floor. No distinction there. Um, and that leads me to say this folks, one behavior does not elicit more from us than any other behavior. I don't get more excited about this thing the child does and less excited about this thing the child does. Um, both elicit the same degree of reaction from me and yet I don't mean to imply that I'm flat in the play room, or, um, non-expressive. I think you've already seen from the video clips that you've seen that um my voice goes up and down, my face changes a lot, um I'm involved with children. I'm not uh flat in affect at all. Well, those are the areas where we would set therapeutic limits. The steps in setting therapeutic limits, these are carefully worked out folks. So that we can be consistent in the way we set limits with children. 

00:33:05
Steps in Therapeutic Limit Setting Step 1: Acknowledge Child's feelings and wants 

00:33:05
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Step one is to acknowledge the child's feelings and wants. A child is loading the dart gun and their teeth are clenched and they're glaring at you as they load the dart gun. And you know what the child is feeling at that moment. They look like they're angry. So the first thing that would come out of our mouth would be an acknowledgement of the child's feeling. "You're angry at me." That often stops the sequence. The child now knows, "Oh, she knows I'm angry at her. I don't need to go ahead and shoot her. She's already got the message." In some cases, more is needed though. The child continues and out comes the gun; it's loaded and it starts swinging. 

00:34:00
Steps in Therapeutic Limit Setting Step 1: Acknowledge Child's feelings and wants Step 2: Communicate the Limit 

00:34:00
DR. GARRY LANDRETH The second step in therapeutic limit setting is to communicate the limit. ''You're angry at me. I'm not for shooting.'' The second step is what I refer to as my educational approach. We're just educating children about things are for. The child is holding um, um a magic marker. Well it wouldn't be a magic marker, but a marker and looks longingly at the wall. There's not anger or happiness, there's just a child looks longingly at the wall. I would say to the child, "You'd like to mark on the wall." See I want to recognize that. "You'd like to mark on the wall. The wall's not for marking on." The child picks up a cup of red tempera paint at the easel, looks into the paint and looks at the floor. I know what that child's thinking and you know what the child is thinking. And so we would say to the child, "You'd like to pour the paint on the floor, but the fl-, paints not for pouring on the floor." Just an educational approach. A child takes a ball, starts trying to hit the light , "You'd like to hit the light, but the light's not for hitting with the ball." 

00:35:15
Steps in Therapeutic Limit Setting Step 1: Acknowledge Child's feelings and wants Step 2: Communicate the Limit Step 3: Target Acceptable Alternative 

00:35:20
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Third step in therapeutic limit setting, target acceptable alternatives. The child is squinting at you, loading the gun. "You're angry at me," the gun comes around, "I'm not for shooting. You can pretend the bobo is me and shoot the bobo." Or the child, um, takes the marker, looks at the wall. "You'd like to mark on the wall. The wall's not for marking on. The paper on the table is for marking on.'' Picks up the can of red temper paint, looks at the floor, "You'd like to pour paint on the floor. The floors not for pouring paint on. The pan on the stove is for pouring paint into, or the sink is for pouring paint into.'' So that we're providing an acceptable avenue for the child to express their feeling or their want or their need. Our, our objective folks is to always help the child to move forward in expressing their need. Our objective is not to stop the behavior. We're not thinking about, "Oh, I've got to stop this.'' Um, a, a child has a, a need or a feeling that they want to express. If we stop that behavior, what happens to the need or the feeling? Well it does not evaporate, right? It goes back in and builds and then comes out with greater strength in some other setting. So what we're always thinking about is not stopping the behavior, but how can I help this child to express that in a more socially acceptable way? And that's this third step, alternatives. We would target alternatives that help this child to go on with the process of expressing themselves. 

00:37:30
Steps in Therapeutic Limit Setting Step 1: Acknowledge Child's feelings and wants Step 2: Communicate the Limit Step 3: Target Acceptable Alternative Remember to ACT 

00:37:35
DR. GARRY LANDRETH And to remember to do that, you can remember to ACT, acknowledge, "A", "C", communicate, "T", target, ACT. So you can just remember to ACT. You've got to acknowledge the feeling, uh, "C". communicate the limit, "T", target some choices. Uh, I'd like for you to uh work on that enough in your mind enough that you `d wake up in the middle of the night. If I walked into your, uh, to your bedroom in the middle of the night and tapped you on the shoulder and you sat up and I said set a limit you'd just immediately go, "acknowledge the feeling, communicate the limit, target some choices,'' and go back to sleep. It'll be that ingrained in you because when the need for setting the limit occurs in the playroom, there isn't time to think. There isn't time to go back and say, "Let's see. What did Garry say about that?'' No, it's got to be there right quickly coming out. Now, um, I need to add uh, one other, um, dimension here and that is, sometimes things are moving so quickly you don't have time to go in that order of A-C-T. Like the child loads the gun and suddenly there it is. And by the time you say, "You're angry at me,'' the missile is on its way. So sometimes you have to start with step two. "I'm not for shooting, '' and then you can cycle back. [00:39:05 "I'm not for shooting. You're angry at me, but I'm not for shooting. You can pretend the bobo is me and shoot the bobo." Now folks, this, uh sequence of therapeutic limit setting will not be very likely to work unless you do what you saw me do each time I set the limit, got to that third step. What did I do each time with the third step when I targeted an acceptable alternative? You point to it. This will not work as likely if you don't point to what is acceptable. What happens when you point? The child looks at what is acceptable so they're now already headed in that direction to move toward what is acceptable. Therefore they're more likely then to make a decision in that direction. Now, I know what some of you are thinking, "Yes Garry, but what if they still shoot you?'' I don't believe the child will shoot me. If I go through these three steps in therapeutic limit setting, I do not believe the child will shoot me. Do you? The test of what you believe. I'm serious. I do not believe this child will shoot me. Have I ever been shot? Oh, many times. But I don't believe this child will shoot me again. . I do not believe this child will shoot me again. Have I ever been shot a second time. Oh lots of times. But I do not believe this child will shoot me again. Do you hear the communication folks? What am I trying to say to you? I believe in this child. I believe this child will bring self under control and that belief is not altered or shattered just because the child shoots me once or just because the child makes one mistake, or just because the child makes one decision that I don't agree with. That does not change my child in the-, my belief in this child. Who else believes in the child that way? Who else continues to believe in the child in spite of the child's behavior? Think about it folks. How can you come to believe in yourself if nobody ever believes in you? How can you come to trust yourself if nobody ever trusts you? How can you come to like yourself if nobody ever likes you? How can you come to love and appreciate yourself if nobody loves and appreciates you? This is a powerful dimension in children's lives, the belief that we have, and that's not going to change. Now, for those of you who are struggling with that yes, but what if he does shoot you? There is a fourth step and some of you just breathed a deep sigh of relief. There is a fourth step and the fourth step is what I refer to as my ultimate choice. The child shoots me and I would say to the child, "You just had to find out what it would be like to shoot me and now you know, but I'm not for shooting.'' Child shoots me again; I would go through the same thing. I'm a little reluctant to give you this fourth step because your tendency will be to use it too quickly. So let me caution you about that, we would, we, we would want to respond to the child in such a way that we give the child chances, several chances to bring self under control. That's the only way they will learn how to bring self under control is by experiencing the opportunity to bring self under control. So we've gone through the three steps of the limit setting three times and now the child shoots me again and the ultimate choice would come out this way, "If you choose to continue to try to shoot me, you choose not to play with the gun for the rest of our time today." Or if the child has crayons and is coloring on something that shouldn't be colored, "If you choose to continue to try to mark with the crayons on the wall, then you choose not to play with the crayons for the rest of our time today.'' Now the ball is in the child's court. The responsibility is clearly placed on the child and we've used the word "choose" to emphasize where the responsibility lies. Folk if your response at this point does not contain the word "choose," this will not work. If you say to the child, "If you choo-, if you shoot me, you can't play with the gun anymore today." That's a threat, but if you say to the child, "If you choose to try to shoot me, then you choose not to play with the gun for the rest of our time together today.'' Now the child is in charge and let's suppose the child does go ahead and shoot you or the child marks with the crayon, the next statement would be, "I see you've chosen not to play with the gun for the rest of our time together today. You may choose to put the gun on the table beside me or you may choose to put the gun on the shelf. Which do you choose?'' Folks, the brain when presented with a choice will tend to process the choice. It almost can't do otherwise, so now I have a choice to make, put it on the table or put it on the shelf. I'm going to process the choice. Um, and the reason for that is to continue to give this child an opportunity to take care of this situation so that you don't have to get up out of the chair and grab the gun, which I would never do. Just because the child violates the limit, I'm not going to jump up and grab the item. Do you realize folks, you're on the verge here of a power struggle? And the tendency in the midst of power struggles is to exhort authority. I want to avoid doing that. If the child spends the rest of this time struggling with this issue and me struggling with the child with this issue, of the gun and they haven't given it up, I'll struggle the next 30 minutes over that issue, but I'm not gonna get up and grab the gun. Now, you have questions. Would I allow the child to strike me? No. Would I allow the child to break my $1200 two-way mirror? No. Would I allow the child to knock a hole in the wall with...no. Would I allow the child to take the hammer and knock this light...no. If I can prevent it, I will. However, you're not fast enough. 

00:46:40
[sil.] 

00:46:45
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Think about it folks. If I'm here and you're there and I'm threatening to shoot you, can you get out of your seat and stop me from shooting you? You're not fast enough. Or, I'm threatening to knock a hole in the wall with the hammer and you're 15 feet or 10 feet over there, you can't cross the room before I can swing this hammer. Therefore, you might as well relax and trust, and trust that if you respond appropriately the child will in like manner respond appropriately, because If you jump out of your chair to try to grab this, what am I going to do? Your action will cause me to act and boom, there it goes. Uh, so, you might as well trust that I'm going to bring myself under control because you cannot do otherwise. Now, if you're standing right here, that's a different matter. I'll stop you if I can, if I can. If a child is absolutely out of control, then we may have to leave the play room. That has happened to me twice in 30 years. Do you hear the message folks? We struggle with this, we struggle with this. Clark Moustakas used to say, "There is absolutely no reason for ever leaving the playroom, ever.'' Well, I've had a couple of times when I felt it was necessary, but a few, just a few folks. Uh, so, the exceptions, yes, we would try to do whatever we need to do to bring this under control. 

00:48:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Let's take a look at your responses and I'll respond to your responses. 

00:48:40
[sil.] 

00:48:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH David picks up the dart gun, looks angry, aims at your face, and your first response? 

00:48:45
UNKNOWN I'm not for shooting. 

00:48:50
DR. GARRY LANDRETH This may be happening very quickly. You know, suddenly there it is and in this case you would need to start with step two, "I'm not for shooting,'' and then you can cycle back, "You look like you're angry at me'' or simply, "You're angry at me, but I'm not for shooting.'' And then the third step? "You can pretend the bobo is me and shoot the bobo'' and you point toward the bobo. Number two, David is playing with the dart gun and announces, "I'm going to take this shooter gun home with me," and your response? 

00:49:30
UNKNOWN The shooter gun is for the playroom. 

00:49:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH The shooter gun's for the playroom. 

00:49:35
UNKNOWN It will be here for you next time. 

00:49:40
DR. GARRY LANDRETH In as many cases as possible, we want to always start by letting the child know I understand, I hear, I hear you. What are those four healing messages? I'm here, I hear you, I understand, I care. So we begin with that issue here. I'm fully here, I do hear that message and so I want to let you know what I understand that I just heard, that you'd like, so it'd come out that way, "You'd like to take the gun home with you, but the toys are for staying in the playroom," not the gun, the toys. We generalize now. "The toys are for staying in the playroom so they'll be here when you come back next time.'' And now we've shown great consideration looking ahead to the child's possible needs next time. David is playing with the glue and the paper and he says, "What would happen if I put some of this glue in the sand?`` 

00:50:40
[sil.] 

00:50:45
DR. GARRY LANDRETH This is an item to check you. Um, can you tolerate a mess? Is it okay if the child is a little messy? Um, for me there would be no problem with glue in the sand. That just makes it a little more interesting. Um, if, if you're really looking through the child's eyes, and being empathic and the child is wondering about something, what will you find yourself doing? Wondering. If the child is feeling confused, you would be feeling some of that confusion. If the child is feeling sad, you would sense the child's sadness. So here the child is wondering about what would happen if I put some of this glue in the sand and out of my mouth came, "Hmm, wonder what would happen if you put some of that glue in the sand.'' I'm wondering too, because I'm looking through the child's eyes. I'm wondering what that would be like because this child is wondering what that would be like. Uh, if there is a problem with the glue in the sand, you can always fish it, scoop it out later after the session's over and throw it in the trash can. And you're wondering, "Yes, but what if he puts the whole quart or jar of glue in the sand?'' The solution to that is, there is no quart jar of glue in my playroom. That's too much. There's a little container, holds about an ounce and we put the, we buy quart jars of glue. We keep that in storage and we put the glue in the little container and then the child can use it all. "I used it all.'' There's something releasing about, "I used it all," releasing about that. So that would not bother me to have some glue in the sand. With 20 minutes remaining in the session David says , "I think my mom is wondering where I am, and he walks for the door , this is happening pretty quickly folks. First word out of your mouth to get my, if I were that child, to get my attention would be what? You have not used the child's name before very much in individual play therapy. It's always, "you, you'' and so now out comes "David" and you get the child's attention because you have, he hasn't heard his name very much in here. So that stops the child and then you add, what? "I know you'd like to go down and talk to your mom, but we have 20 more minutes in the playroom and then," and folks this is a crucial addition, "and then it will be time to go down to the waiting room where your mom is.'' If a child says ``How much time do we have left?" and you say, "20 minutes," and the child says, "Well I want to go see my mom,'' and you say, "Well, we have 20 more minutes." The child's now won-, left wondering, "Will I ever get to leave?'' So it's important that you add that last dimension: "and then it will be time to go down to the waiting room where your mom is.'' 

00:54:10
UNKNOWN What if they continue for the door and put their hand on the door? 

00:54:10
DR. GARRY LANDRETH Uh, the question is what happens if the child goes to the door and puts their hand on the door, puts their hand on the doorknob. That's fine with me. I've had children, I've had children threaten to leave for 35 minutes with their hand on the doorknob. Um, and folks all they've got to do is walk out the door. I'm sitting across the room, but if you respond in this understanding, non-threatening kind of way, it makes a difference. I had one five-year-old who said to me, "Um, I'm leaving," and I said, "I know you'd like to leave but we have 35 more minutes in the playroom and then it will be time to leave." "You can't make me stay," she said. "Oh, you'd like to be the one to decide just when you get to leave," and she said, "Yes," and she headed for the door. And I said, "I know you'd like to leave, but we have 32 more minutes in the playroom and then it will be time to go," and she's over at the door with her hand on the doorknob, and she said, "You can't make me stay. You try to make me stay, I'll find out where you live and I'll come drown your children.'' And then she cracked the door and so I reflected, "You're really angry at me. You'd just like to be the one to decide what you get to do, but we have 30 more minutes in the playroom and then it will be time to leave." And she started cussing me. She's five-years-old. I learned some new cuss words from her. I hadn't heard them before. She stood for 32 minutes with her hand on the doorknob and the door cracked, threatening to leave and never left. And I'm seated across the room. All she's got to do is dash out the door. There's no way I could have caught her until we got down the hallway. And, by the way, if she had left, I would've gone after her. My job is to take care of this child. I'm not gonna let her wander around out there by herself somewhere. I would've gone after the child and then it'd be my job to work her back into the playroom, but she never left. She kept threatening to leave, she was angry about it, but she never left. Was there another question about the limits setting? Yes? 

00:56:30
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:56:35
DR. GARRY LANDRETH The question is, would there ever be a time that the child left and didn't want to come back that I would just accept that. No, my approach is um we still have work to do and there's still time to do it unless we've got less than five minutes and then I'm not gonna make an issue out of that. It's just our times up for today and after we're outside in the hallway or the waiting room, I wouldn't spend time trying to work her back inside the playroom. There wouldn't be time to do anything once we got back. But if we have 10 more minutes or 15 more minutes , there's time to do some things in the playroom. A lot can happen in a play therapy room in 10 minutes. So I would be, uh, wanting to make that possible. 

00:57:25
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:57:30
DR. GARRY LANDRETH We've got 30 more minutes, she's out in the waiting room holding onto her mom, it's my job to try to get her back into the playroom. One of the things I might say is, "Mom, looks like Deborah needs to know that you know where the playroom is, so if you'll come with us down to the playroom, then she'll know that you know where the playroom is." And so Mom escorts us down to the playroom and at the door, I would separate mom and the child which can usually be done easily by just stepping between the two of them and usher the child into the playroom. If this is a frightened child, a child who's highly anxious, then I would allow Mom to come into the playroom. I'm not going to force the child into here with me and the child get traumatized by this experience and I would just say to Mom, "You sit in the corner and I'll do all the talking.'' And then after we're comfortable with each other and I sense the timing is right, I might turn to Mom and just sort of aside say, "You can go back to the waiting room now.'' Um and in most cases, that's okay with the child at that point. If it's not, Mom may have to stay a little bit longer. I can tell you ahead of time, once Mom comes into the playroom, it's much more difficult to help Mom and child separate or child to separate from Mom, so I don't recommend that as just a routine procedure, of the parent coming into the playroom with the child. It makes separation very difficult.
