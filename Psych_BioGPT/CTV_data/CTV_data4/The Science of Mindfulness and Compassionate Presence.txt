CHRISTOPHER WILLARD Hi, I'm Dr. Christopher Willard. Here we to open this session today with a short practice. So on way to do is start by finding a comfortable position in your seat. Sitting upright allowing your eyes to close if that feels comfortable or just resting on the floor underneath you. And just following the sound of the bell. 

00:00:45
[sil.] 

00:00:50
CHRISTOPHER WILLARD And finding some way in which you can make contact with the present moment. Perhaps, through sensations in your body. We have to breath. Perhaps, sounds. And like you just imagine that you are some place comfortable someplace safe it can be indoors or in nature. And one of the things that happens when we sit down to make contact with the present bring an image to mind, pretty quickly we begin to notice that we're having thoughts, having feelings and there is usually coming from a few different places. So you may first notice that your thoughts are going to the future, coming from the past going somewhere else. So just noticing each thought about the future as it arises about perhaps this next hour, perhaps this course or perhaps the rest of your day, week or even life. Now with the each thought to mention that you're sitting there and thought down next to you. Just notice those thoughts of the future and setting them in a pile next to you. And when you notice thoughts about the past (inaudible ) the day is quite going to get here to sit down and start watching this just noticing those thoughts and then setting those aside as well. 

00:02:55
[sil.] 

00:03:00
CHRISTOPHER WILLARD Some of those thoughts in the more distant past begin to rise. Sitting there as aside you notice… notice your mind somewhere else altogether and the other side of town with your patience with loved ones noticing those thoughts setting them aside. Those any judgments you might be bringing forward within excitement, preconceived notions just setting those aside in a pile as we just clear a space. Start from a place of stillness. Start from a place of more clarity. And start from the present moment and then just a moment or ring the bell.

CHRISTOPHER WILLARD And just returning your awareness to the rest of your surroundings. Screen in front of you my face and voice. Welcome back to the present. I'll be sharing a little bit today about the science of mindfulness and compassion, mindful and compassionate to presence. What we're talking about what is mindfulness so much we've defined it in this course. We'll talk about why we're training ourselves in mindfulness and compassion, why that's so critical to the work that we do as clinicians. I'll be sharing a little bit about a model that I have to think about how we can teach and how we were in mindfulness. I was speaking about the science of stress which is where so much of the research originally came from in the mindfulness world umm… as well as uh… compassion and presence. Through the latter half of the program I'll be sharing about how we transform empathy that's innate to all of us and that compassion and keeping that compassion alive especially in the face of burnout and vicarious trauma and the other things that we as clinicians struggle with. We're talking about ways that mindfulness and compassion and… and the science of what we already know in terms of things like counter transference and transference, how that kind of works together. We'll to be doing some exercises on cultivating inner wisdom, inner intuitive wisdom for clinical decision making for when we get stuck with those difficult patients are stuck with ourselves. And, of course, the fun part we'll be doing these practices and adaptations throughout and I really encourage you to do these along with me. Every day in our offices we're asking our clients our patients to be a little bit vulnerable. And we're forgetting sometimes that is part of our job to be more vulnerable to take a risk as well. So I encourage you to do that both in this segment and in the rest of the course as we go. So I wanna say a little bit about presence and what's even the point of presence. And I think we probably have a sense of that and a sense of why mindful and compassionate and presence is so important. Well, for one thing we all kind of know what it's like to be around someone who's completely present maybe if it's been an old supervisor and old friend or relative someone like that. And you just get that feeling of safety from them. You just feel good around them. And that's exactly what we're trying to cultivate in this program in ourselves as clinicians is that kind of presence. What's more when we're present we're happy, when we're present we're open, when we're present we're calm we're able to see clearly we're able to see all of the tools at our disposal. Think a back to what we learned in graduate school or think back to what we learnt in the last session or what we learned in supervision. And bring that forward into the clinical encounter into this moment. That's another part of presence and why it's so important. My friend Bill who you, you'll see I have already seen in this program. Abraham asking once would you rather have more focus or more skills, more presence or more skills as a clinician? So many of us we want more and more focus, more presence, more awareness of what's happening moment to moment so we can then use that to inform our decision making, use that to… to carry the empathy umm… toward our toward our patients as well. So with that I wanna also to show a little bit of a… a model that I like to think of when I think about teaching mindfulness. (inaudible ) say teaching mindfulness is like planting seeds and we don't know what's gonna grow. But really when we're trying to teach someone whether it's our patients or anyone else in our lives mindfulness where it starts is with us. Who are primarily with kids talk to parents all the time teachers and I get asked this question over and over again. What's the best practice for my kid who's having a meltdown, what's the best practice for the person with (inaudible ), the depressed person, the anxious person. And you'll hear some of that in this course but ultimately the best practice for those people is your practice. Your practice your ability to stay calm, compassionate and connected that's gonna be the most valuable. The most healing thing that you can offer your patients is your very mindful and compassionate presence. So it starts with us. And we think about planting seeds, we also need to think about how do scenes grow? So maybe we want our… our clients our patients to be living mindfully at the very top of this pyramid that you see. But where it starts is with us. Right? So it's with creating mindful communities of other therapists or if you work in a clinic maybe educating some of your colleagues or if you work in a school or you work in a hospital maybe finding some mindfulness in the community. Even if it's just you and one of your colleagues that's the sunshine, that's the rainwater, that's the… the soil that we… we fertilize for these seeds to grow. And then we think about teaching mindfulness in the sessions with who were with and teach about encouraging them to practice more independently. And then ultimately maybe they get to that point where they're moving a little more mindfully or maybe we are. But at the bottom it starts with us. I also like this chart because it tells us a little bit about resistance. And all of our patients are gonna be living perfectly mindfully if they're not we can help them to practice independently. We just go back down. They're not practicing independently, we think more about how can I teach mindfulness when we're together. If they're not kind of buying into that, we can go back to our community of mindful practitioners, you can find online or find in your town or you can find through this course reaching out to the faculty here and find a community that way. If you're struggling with finding a community, you always have your own practice that you can go back to which is and it sense the most valuable thing that you can offer your patients or your clients. So with that as we move forward, I wanna actually start to get into what is mindfulness. (inaudible ) we all have some idea of what it is. I asked this in person in live workshops for years now one quite new and more and more people cope with an answer pretty quickly as a group. But I'll sure the definition that I like to use for mindfulness and I'll explain why I like to use it. To me mindfulness is "Paying attention to the here and now with acceptance and non-judgment." It's fairly clinical sounding. It's a little bit different than some definitions you might have heard and certainly use what works for you. We'll tell you why this works for me. We can divide this into three parts and one of the best things about that is we can think throughout this course and for ourselves about practices that are about paying attention or being aware. We can think about practices that good get us making contact with the here and now with this present moment we can think about practice as the teach acceptance and non judgment. We can think of putting all of those together in the form of mindfulness, compassion and self compassion. So we can start first with attention. Now probably some one of us have been told to pay attention, none of us have ever wanted anyone else around us to pay attention. But so many of us are never actually taught or know how to teach anyone how to pay attention. So we start by learning how to pay attention, how to be aware. We also think a little bit about the here and now. I've been practicing mindfulness for almost 20 years. I didn't understand this present moment here and now stuff until I started thinking about oh, when I'm in the here and now then my mind is not, you know, kind of in often the future wondering, you know, what's for dinner or what's gonna happen or am I gonna be able to get insurance reimbursement for this patient. Most of all stuck in the past. All right. Oh, this, you know, this is reminding me of something from the past and kind of that cascade of thoughts in that direction. And my mind isn't somewhere else altogether halfway across town. No I'm back here in the present moment, fully present with myself with my client and frankly with anybody else in our lives being in the present moment with them. What else is important about the present moment, when we're in the present moment we're happier. Look at the research of (inaudible ) Killingsworth. One of the things that he found is that what we're doing is about half as important to our happiness as whether we know that we're doing it, whether we're engaged, whether involved, whether of being present with what that task is. That's what's actually key to be in happy. What's more we're not used to being in the present our minds are wandering 47% of the time. Let me say that again 'cause half of you probably miss that. 47% of the time, half of the time our minds are wandering. But that's not that we wanna give up hope. We can train them to come back that's what training in mindfulness is training ourselves to come back to the present moment because our minds are always wandering. They're always somewhere else right or they're half the time somewhere else. There's a great fake quote I found from (inaudible ). Some of you have probably seen this flowing around online. Well, that's who it is alleged to have said. Depression is living in the past. Anxiety is living in the future. Happiness and peace can only be found in the present moment. Whether it's a real quote or not, I think that does tell us something about the importance of the present moment. Lastly we have this piece about non-judgement and acceptance. This is also a little bit abstract for some of us. It means a few things it means accepting who we are, it means helping our clients and patients accept who they are. Because for so many of them for example, we think if they're struggling with mental health issues if they're struggling with identity related issues they have the whole world they have their internalized voices of their parents or old teachers or the larger culture telling them that there's something wrong with because of their mental health issues, something… something wrong with them because of the color of their skin or other identity markers. And that's causing so much of that suffering. So part of it is wanting to not judge and accept themselves. And just as much a part of it is learning to not judge and learning to accept just our experience that we don't have to like it but we have to accept it. That's when we can begin to change which is why I have this favorite Cole Rogers quote up here. "The curious paradox is that when I begin to accept myself as I am that's when I can truly change." That's what that self acceptance peace is about. So I think come up as much in the classic literature on mindfulness from eastern traditions. What we've really tried to emphasize it in Western traditions of mindfulness. Self acceptance and general acceptance or even say self compassion which will certainly be hearing more about from Dr. Chris Cramer. So that's what I think of when I think of the definition of mindfulness, paying attention to the here and now with acceptance in judgment. And the thing is it's not just about planting the seeds of mindfulness because the reality is the seeds are already there. Mindfulness is perfectly natural we've just cut it out of our lives in so many ways. So if you look back at your life, if you look back at childhood, there's surely a time when you can remember being fully present and being aware of the fact that you were fully present and just accepting the moment and accepting what comes and accepting yourself in that moment. Often when I ask people about this they describe a beautiful childhood memories. They describe being in nature, they describe feeling close to a caregiver who really cared for them. And (inaudible ) they'll describe something to do with their senses, their five senses comes up a lot as a moment of mindfulness. And so what we're trying to do in this course is not just plant new seeds but one of the seeds that are already there. Mindfulness is… is a natural part of the human experience as is compassion. But we can train it because we forget to practice it in our busy time with our cell phones with all of our other myriad of distractions. We need to remember to learn how to practice mindfulness. Train ourselves. And the short practice that I like is a demonstration of what's happening with mindfulness. I learn this from umm… a friend of mine in Vancouver, it's called "The Three R's." And it's a simple way to remember mindfulness. First we just rest our awareness on something that you hear some talk about anchors maybe that's the breath and that's an image of a favorite place maybe that's your body sensations in the body listening to sounds. It can be anything, even a mantra. We start by resting uh… attention pretty soon. What happens is that our mind wanders off. And what we do is we just recognize that recognize when, we recognize where our mind wanders off and we just gently return to the present moment. Try it together where I used to close or rest on something in front of you. 

00:17:25
[music] 

00:17:30
CHRISTOPHER WILLARD You're just resting your awareness on the anchor. Unless you focus on the anchor, what you're doing in your brain and in your mind as you're building the muscle of concentration just resting now. The mind will start to wander. Thoughts will appear. Each time you notice and when the mind is wandering. And it's where, it's gone and got it back return it back gently to your anchor, to the breath, to the body, to the image. So it's resting. Recognizing, returning. So each time you focus, you build that muscle of focus. So we noticed that the mind is wandering. That's not the problem in fact, that noticing that's the moment of mindfulness. And it's in (inaudible ) them where the mind has wandered that's the moment of insight. And we call these insight practices. Returning your breath to rest once more that's again strengthening the muscle of concentration as well as the muscle of practice of just letting go of whatever the story was. In other part of these practices accepting and each time you recognize and return gently with compassion for yourself without judgment, that's actually practicing self compassion. So that in this practice of resting, recognizing and returning we're building focus, we're building insight, we're practicing letting go, we're practicing self compassion. Just taking a few more moments. 

00:20:10
[sil.] 

00:20:20
CHRISTOPHER WILLARD And then slowing eyes to open, your windows to return to the room around you. Such a short practice of mindfulness. In a concentration practice you might simply notice your mind wandering and bring it back. With mindfulness what we do is we notice where the mind has wandered and then we gently bring ourselves back. That's some of that difference, if there's a question that ever arises in your work with clients. There are other ways we can kind of understand mindfulness as well. I have here a picture you might notice uh… difference between these two. (inaudible ) human being the mind is full of uh… the bills are piling up, the traffic is kind of going everywhere, right, just standing at a picture of a podium that should probably be worrying about public speaking. All of that kind of thing. Right. And the dog, the dog sees the sunshine, the dog sees the trees, the dog sees what's there. The dog has none of the thoughts about the future, none the thoughts about the past, none of the worries. The human being actually misses out on the trees and the sunshine. Right. This is what happens. S4o many of us have had this experience. All right. We're so busy worried about other things, we're so busy multitasking, stressed out that we miss what's actually happening around us. And it's also not that mindfulness is about only seeing the sunshine in the trees and seeing everything that's beautiful in the world and it's not at all. In fact, one of my young clients pointed out to me, you know, if the human being's not paying attention then he's gonna step in the dog crap. There's gonna step in the dog credit they don't watch out. Let us not just seeing the beauty it's in the danger in the world as well. Because what happens is the more stressed we get the more vicarious trauma we take on. That starts actually change our perception of the world. And we'll talk about how that happens in terms of stress in just a moment. So I wanna say a little bit and demonstrate a little bit about the stress response that's wired into us as human beings. You know, so much of the good work that people are doing around mindfulness has evolved out of junk habits into wonderful mindfulness based stress reduction program. You may have heard about that. And that's because what he found was that teaching people how to reduce their stress through mindfulness had all these incredible… incredible benefits because guess what life is stressful. Right. And… and that's just one of the basic facts of life. We can't always change umm… our conditions but around us where we can change ourselves or if is… is challenging and full of suffering. So the stress response so they can do this exercise with me. This is something I share a lot with clients when I'm working with them. I want you to start and this is a little bit based on something you may see Chris do as well. Put your hands out like this and just make really tight fits and just notice what that's like. That is what happens in your body. That is what happens with your breath. And this is also what happens in your mind does feel open or closed. And then ask yourself if there are times you feel like this, (inaudible ) see in clients feel like this. So you continue to hold just noticing what happens, I mean, a feeling stirred me. And just let go. And that's what it's like to let go. Now what I'd like you to do it not just let it go but I wanna just kind of collapse over like this or even deeper and almost a… a ragdoll position. And again asking yourself the same questions as you collapse over in your seat. What's happening to my body? What's happening to my breath? Is my mindful open or closed? Do I feel awake and alert? Do we feel sleep or something else? Consider times you may have felt like this or patients that maybe look like this. Bring in this body language into the office. Then sitting back up straight again. This time hand open outward, upward taking again breath, body, mind open or closed awake in order to sleep. Times you feel like this as you've seen your clients feel like this. And if you like for one hand on the other distress these over your heart. When it's more breath, body, mind times you feel like this, times you see another it's feel like this. And you can just say, your hands down back to your online professional development posture whatever that might be for you. So I wanna unpack a little bit of what's happening here. So one… one thing that happens is we start to change our bodies it changes our physiology, we change our bodies it changes our mind. So I was such a skeptic about mind body connections. I'm a science guy through and through. When I discovered mindfulness almost 20 years ago, it started to make sense. The mind and the body are connected. We change our bodies it changes our minds, we change our minds it changes how our bodies feel. And that's actually happening. And part of what's happening with stress is that often when we're stressed out we regress as you can see on the slide. Right. And there are a few different ways that we respond to stress. We have this system this way of dealing with stress that evolved to keep us safe from physical threats in the world. Right. (inaudible ) tiger chasing us. It's still with us even when we're facing things like academic threats, social threats, romantic threats, financial threats we respond in the same few ways. Right. Not always hopeful for all of those, helpful for some but not helpful for all. It's also the more stress we're under whether it's a chronic stress whether it's a, you know, in the media in… in… in an post-traumatic stress, we have these same responses built into us. And a few things happen in the brain or what is happening in the brain, the (inaudible ) that kind of cave dweller older part of the brain that turns on. That's where their brains fight or flight system is. Oxytocin, that warm and fuzzy a lot of hormone, that shuts off. When that when that's off, cortisol is actually what shuts that off. Cortisol is the stress hormone it shuts off the warm and fuzzy umm… oxytocin love hormone. The prefrontal cortex appear and all of our outer cortices for that matter, they start to shut off. They would allow us to see the big picture or to think more clearly when the medulla turns on. And so everyone starts looking like a threat. Right. That nice therapist or the husband or the other driver on the highway or the, you know, competitor at work also to look like a threat that we need to fight, flee or… or… or freeze or basically umm… hide away from. So these responses that we're talking about basically have fight or flight. Right. What I'd call freeze and forget it and probably put another effort there if you're feeling creative. But basically these are a few of the responses that we have to stress when there are there are there are hard wired into us evolutionarily. What else is happening in terms of our physiology, in the body the breath starts to tighten up, right, heart rate goes up, muscles start to clench, digestive system shuts off, the immune system even shuts off. Right. So when we get sick when we're so stressed out what we get stomach cramping and… and all that kind of thing. What else is happening in our in our brains is that we're all kind of wired a little bit for the negative but we have these negativity filters start to swoop in and way just everything looks like a danger, hyper vigilance. Right. And so over time under chronic stress or any kind of stress burned out from our work whatever it might be or our patients, right, we end up, you know, aggressive that's a fight response. Flight, right, that's more the anxious response get me out of here. Right. And there's the freeze and forget of response, that's kind of the learned helplessness depressed response. All right. Back in nature that's feed into the woodwork, hide out, camouflage yourself or wait for the worst of the attack to be over. Now the really scaring part is what the interesting part is that we the more we're kind of under these stresses the more that hardwires our brain to be like this all of the time. Right. So we're like the human being kind of like that all the time missing out on what's actually happening. The good news however is that we can actually reverse that with some other responses that are also hired wired into us. We have fight flight freeze and forget it but we also have what are called the attend and be friend responses. That's what a number of researchers are now talking about. That's the physiology of mindfulness and compassion. Attend, befriend… befriend ourselves and befriend other people who ever also is here. A system for care giving and connecting the opposite starts to happen, they make (inaudible ) shuts off that flips the switch for the outer cortices to come back on the line, see the big picture, think creatively look at all the possible scenarios in front of us. How could I respond to this patient or how for our patients could they be interpreted situation differently there is not immediate cause for panic in some ways. But open mind allows us to feel connected to other people, the negativity filters come off. We're able to see more clearly friend from foe, danger from safety. See the short and the long term consequences of whatever actions we take. We respond rather than react is what starts to happen in our brains. What else is happening in the body you've probably noticed all the breath is a little bit slower so a little bit more even. When our breath is flowing more evenly, openly our minds also open up in fact, our brains open up to take more information in get more information out. See more clearly the heart rate starts to slow down, muscles relax, immune system fires back up because (inaudible ) all my energy into the short term survival, I can figure out how to survive in the long term, digestive system starts working again all of these kinds of things. And so one of the things about these responses where there's some misconceptions is that it's not like fight or flight is bad attended befriend is good. It's about what situation we're in. All right. I don't wanna be an attendant befriend when someone cuts me off on the highway. Some of our patients have lived through incredibly dangerous situations whether it's dangerous emotionally, dangerous physically or dangerous in other ways. And they have gotten rewired to kind of be in that mode because they need that for survival. Right. That's why it's wired into us. But the reality is that we're trying to create a safe space where they can start to open up a little bit more like this and like this, that's part of what we're offering them. Maybe it starts in our office and they start to build it out from there. Another example of kind of how these responses are useful in different ways, I'm from Boston, I grew up here. So my whole life here grew up watching the Boston Marathon. And a few years ago I was in Finland giving a version of this workshop. And on the break I, not very mindfully look down and checked my phone. I had about a dozen text messages asking if I was okay. And I checked the news in the Boston Marathon bombing had happened and my first response in that moment. And I say this because I was practicing mindfulness for a while but that's my chest. Right. It's a completely natural compassionate response. Care for myself, care for my friends, you know, be mindful in order enough to think, okay how can I reach out to people back home and see who's okay. Right. If I've been at the finish line you bet I don't wanna be in fight or flight. But where I was, I was able to have the reaction to attend to myself befriend myself reach out and care for the people that I loved who were back home when that event happened. So again it's not that fight flight is bad attend befriend is good but we're trying to do is practice that we can shift gears between each of these. This is also important in our practice because we… we're… we're wired to connect with each other, we're wired to connect with our patients. And what that means, one of the things we know is that so many of our emotions are in fact contagious. Right. We can call it social contagion, we can call it transference and counter transference. Right. You can call it Mirror Neurons. There are so many things we can say but we… we've all had that experience that the press patient leaves our office and we feel completely helpless. That anxious patient leaves our office and we're spinning for the next 10 minutes. Right. So a few weeks ago it made a really awful disclosure to me about something that happened to her. And I… I… I actually felt my own body start to go into fight or flight. What I'm gonna do how am I gonna help this person? All right. What it working in front of them or the ethics laws about, you know, maybe the reporting and you know, all these other things sort of, you know, just swimming and feeling my mind that it's going into fight or flight actually felt my body start to heat up and able to figure out how to calm myself down, think clearly okay, I can remember this, I can handle this. Right. But that's because our emotions are contagious. Right. Whether it's our patients challenging emotions that, they're bringing to the office for healing. All right. But it's also whether we're bringing something into that office. We should talk in this field about a blank screen that's not so much what it is, you know, I think what we want more is like a clear vessel right, clarity for ourselves something, you know, clear and calm that we can, you know, hold all the stuff. Clear vessel drop, a little bit of, you know, salt in right it can it can dissolve, we can we can allow it to dissolve in our mindful and our compassion and presence in that moment. That's what we're trying to do. When we practice these practices as… as clinicians ourselves so it starts to create a safe space where our patients can feel safe to settle down, open up, experience that mindfulness and compassion for themselves as well. But we can also remain safe and open throughout. Because what happens as I said is this stuff jumps the transferential divide. They're angry we feel attacked we feel angry back. Right. We feel that absolute helplessness. All right. Oh, how am I gonna what I'm gonna deal with this patient, you know, can I get rid of them, you know, kind of label them access to and refer them on or you know, what… what is that? Right. We start to get helpless. We have all these different kinds of reactions. We get even that anxiety how does that manifest? That avoidance that flight all right, is it, you know, maybe, you know, from the analytic tradition maybe that's why we're five minutes late, maybe that's why we're not prioritizing that person in our schedule. Right. So it does actually kind of make sense in terms of some of the other theories of… of psychotherapy as well. If you look at the analytic and dynamic theories as well in terms of counter-transference that's actually brain responses that can teach us about that. And we all have empathy built in. Some of the work I think as Richly Davidson (inaudible ) was seeing that, you know, when… when any human homeless any human anyway sees pain, they feel that as well. Some humans, they see that pain and they go right into fight or flight they wanna get the heck out of that situation. Those of us in the healing professions what we usually have is more of a compassion response that can be trainable. We'll talk about how to train that. Which is that we start to turn toward that pain, it turns on the action, we get into fight, flight, freeze, anger whatever it is depression and turns into how do I help this person, how do I heal this person. That's where our minds start to go. Actually works on some of the reward networks that that are built into some of us to the rewards that come with… with helping in healing others. And so we go into this work but we get burned out. (inaudible ) to get that empathy fatigue through vicarious trauma through doing this day in and day out but that is where these… these practices of mindfulness and compassion start to train us to be present longer with that suffering, to be compassionate longer, to keep leaning in longer. Right. And we'll talk more and more about how to keep training ourselves in all of that. 

00:37:15
[sil.]

CHRISTOPHER WILLARD Because we can also see in our work how (inaudible ) this does make things difficult. We start to shade our perspective. Right. All that vicarious trauma. Right. So many of us helpers. Right. Whether it's cops and firefighters or people the military or those of us therapist. Right. It starts to shade us a little by little each trauma that we hear about or see so as to make our make the (inaudible ) bigger. And so to see the world less clearly everything starts to look like a danger. But that vital importance like that kid said to be able to see the real danger where there's a real danger, right, where is the dog (inaudible ) versus where's the sunshine. We need to go to see that clearly in our work to help our patients move forward. So a few other practices, we noticed probably that our breath changed. Right. And we started fighter flight even and that kind of freeze forget it response actually our breath often becomes an even… even though it feels quite pretty great for that first couple minutes. Right. Just like this can feel powerful but after a while exhaust and this can feel kind of relaxing but also not great after a while. But our breath can change our physiology, our physiology changes our bodies and that actually does change our brains in kind of how they operate. Now the thing that's interesting is we all have a different kind of set point for our breath. We can kind of take a baseline, this is something I find kind of fun to do with patients once they are, you know, feeling kind of comfortable and… and safe or when they're, you know, in a kind of different spot and then we can look at how do we adjust the breath. So what I'd like you to do is to count how many breaths we have in a minute. I find this easiest if you just count on the out-breath. Don't even try to change your breath just breathing in and one, breath in and out, two. So I'll set the timer and we will go. 

00:39:25
[sil.] 

00:40:25
CHRISTOPHER WILLARD All right. I had nine breaths, nothing particularly magical about that. I do this exercise a lot usually measurably closer to ten. So I get some feeling more relaxed than usual. But what's interesting especially for those of us as therapists who maybe feel like we need a little more focus that we're sorting to lose it at some point in the day is that when we start to slow our breath down and when this from last thing I heard and uh… read in the book by (inaudible ) from Stanford. If we slow our breath and to about four to six breaths per minute that's what's really optimal for a long term focus, for staying on task and for really kind of diving into an activity umm… that keeps our brains kind of as open accepting and focused as possible. It's about four to six breaths per minute. So something to check in with from time to time when you're with your patients just (inaudible ) because we do one thing at a time but, of course, we're always kind of have, you know, kind of things that we're thinking about at the same time with our with our patients. But checking in with our breath can I slow it down where is that right now. And there are a few ways we can start to slow it down for ourselves and also teach our clients how to slow down their breath. As some of you might know I do a lot of work with kids so I go out kind of fun breathing exercises. This one's where you can decide whether it's fun or not but it's quite simple which is called the 7/11 breath and it's about as simple as that sounds. We breathe in counting to seven, we breathe back out all the way back down to eleven. So we can do this together. Breathing in two, three, four, five, six, seven, out two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. Breathing in… 

00:42:20
[sil.] 

00:42:25
CHRISTOPHER WILLARD And out. Breathing in……and out. Try a few more your own pace. 

00:42:45
[sil.] 

00:43:00
CHRISTOPHER WILLARD And just allow your breath to return. Find its own way again find its own place again without trying to control it in any way. This is quite helpful for something like a panic attack or feeling overwhelmed for when your patients if they are struggling with things and you're if you're feeling overwhelmed or need to re-regulate your mind, body and breath… back together. Your breath is that switch kind of between the mind in the body that can re-regulate things back down. Umm… So it's also a piece of homework (inaudible ) give patients to practice this in… in traffic or other stressful situations that they can start to have something they can use when things do get particularly difficult. And there's nothing particularly magical as far as I know about the 7/11 breath I think it's easy to remember. Umm… And one of the things I learned about it is that it's actually used by people on very high stress job, firefighters, MT'S, first responders that kind of thing in the UK is what I had originally heard. So people on very high stress positions, they need to stay very calm, very focused and very challenging in high stress environments, umm… athlete's as well as you can see from… from the image here. Umm… You can also when we breathing for shorter be that for longer that calms the nervous system it can also raise our energy sometimes if you wanna ever try 7/11 breath to kind of bring yourself back up from. You know, the kind of freeze forget it mode that we feel Friday afternoon mode that we might sometimes feel to kind of pick our energy up so that we can meet the present moment head on. Another kind of short practice, this can be fun kind of at the end of a long day or if you, even if you find yourself feeling overwhelmed during a clinical session. We all know what it's like to say I breath of relief at the end of the day or the end of a 15 minute hour or anything like that. And we can just mindfully sigh we can just let out a long silence sigh. I learned this from my friend Irene McHenry(ph) it's pretty simple way to get out some of that frustration just breath in and then just breath out along silence sigh. All the way out slowly go all the way down to the bottom your breath. And just allowing your breath resume to return to normal. There are few short breath practices because again the calm, all of that starts with us and trickles out, right, jumps across the transfer and streams across the mirror neurons if we wanna put it. I found this recently which also struck me as something so important about mindfulness, you know, people are really struggling. And this is never… "In the history of calming down has anyone ever conjured down by being told to calm down." Right. And with mindfulness it's about we create that space where it's safe to calm down. We invite people to calm down, right, with their stress. So it talks about what mindfulness is I wanna say what it's not as well this I think is important for some of us. Mindfulness is not religious or prayer or mystical. Now it can be and I think here many people may have spiritual experiences when they're practicing mindfulness. Umm… It is associated with many if not pretty much every spiritual tradition. But no tradition really to me anyway has a monopoly on this. The Buddha did not invent mindfulness. He did not discover mindfulness. He described mindfulness and so I see it. Right. We've all had that experience of mindfulness and the Buddha happen to be a guy that described mindfulness and how to cultivate it. And that's kind of survived intact through the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn and others. So it's about rediscovering the mindfulness that's there and it's not necessarily religious or spiritual. It's not passive or complacent. Right. Some people were (inaudible ) relax came to that mindfulness stuff. Right. But like this is the bodily embodiment of mindfulness, right, this is that freeze or forget it that's part of why I like that as a teaching exercise. Mindfulness is active and awake. Mindfulness is not a distraction or an escape, Some of us think, you know, think about distraction techniques in our work… work with clients who maybe self harm or have other difficult behaviors. Mindfulness doesn't distract us from anything exactly except for the fact that it distracts us back into the present moment, distracts us out of that horror story maybe telling ourselves or our patients about the future that horror story that they're reliving from their past or just even their mind wandering to what's happening across town. It just brings us back into the present moment, distracts us out of those places and into the present. My focus is also not shutting off thoughts, the other thing I… I can never get my thoughts to shut on I can never do that mindfulness stuff. Now it's… it's trying to change our relationship to our thoughts. And it's a little bit of a kind of jujitsu move, right. If the (inaudible ) to behavioral therapies are about trying to change our thoughts, mindfulness is not so much trying to change our thoughts but trying to change our relationship to our thoughts. But when we do that, we do get different thoughts, generally more clear thoughts or kind of accurate thoughts for the most part. Mindfulness is also not self-indulgent, right, who has time to do nothing all day. But in fact, I really see these as teaching people in some ways uh… a self care skill, resilience skill offering in some ways a public health intervention. When we start teaching people on a larger scale whether it's in a group in a clinic or in a group home or even in schools or places like that, mindfulness will be a public health intervention not anything that self-indulgent. I also see mindfulness is empowering for our patients as well as for ourselves, this can change how we feel. Right. We have control or we have maybe not control we have some influence over our emotions, influence over our ability to focus and pay attention. Right. That's really empowering, people can help themselves feel better. Mindfulness is simple and cheap importable, take it anywhere take it, you know, to… to work take it, to the basketball court take it, you know, right outside of the therapy office with them. Mindfulness is also checking in with our experience rather than checking out from our experience with all of the distractions, all the temptations that we have. (inaudible ) like how I feel and I just grabbed my phone and never learning from that emotion. Learning how to tolerate it or even how to recognize it but face it with mindfulness oh, this is boredom or frustration or anger or all these other emotions. And also we're not just how to recognize them when they come but also recognize when they pass. That's the other thing that we learn from mindfulness that everything's pretty impermanent. These difficult emotions, our challenging thoughts don't hang around forever. Mindfulness is also about connecting rather than disconnecting, connecting to ourselves, connecting to others as well certainly see in other aspects of this course. But for me think about how do we connect with our patients rather than disconnect with all those distractions. It's effective in evidence based builds resilience. And as I think about mindfulness is single tasking rather than multitasking. Right. We live in this multitasking world doing so many things at once. What we know about multitasking is that we're getting half as much done in twice the amount of time. But we feel like we're doing something, we feel like we're getting a lot done because switching around a lot we're (inaudible ) dopamine burst and that feels good. But what we're getting not so much done. So another way of thinking about mindfulness especially in formal practices of mindfulness is this just doing one thing at a time, just noticing what it is that we're doing and the fact that we're doing it. I have a friend who actually invited me on Facebook to an event he was having in a small town up in Scandinavia. And I said, "What is this?" "Do one thing at a time day" is what he called the event. Right. He didn't call the day of mindfulness, he called the "Do one thing at a time day." And encourage us all to kind of practice, take an hour and do one thing at a time, take ten minutes and just do one thing with your complete attention. Another short focused practice I like to do is called the single tasking practice. You can do this along with me. You can have your eyes open or closed. Just rest your finger in the center of your forehead. Just notice where your forehead feels like against your finger. And your finger feels like against your forehead. Just notice temperature warm or cool, texture, smooth or rough, moisture. Try to moist. Mind wanders just bring it back. (inaudible ) and down and open your eyes. Just 30, 60 seconds, right, single tasking, grounding like we're gonna walk around like this all day but even just checking in with your feet. Right. And your legs underneath you asking yourself those same questions about sensations. Just getting into our sensations is a great way of getting into the present moment, great way to bring us back toward mindfulness. But single tasking, again I've got this quote up here saw this on Twitter too because I'm the young one of the group. "There's a guy at this coffee shop sitting at a table, not on his phone, not on his laptop, just drinking his coffee, like a psychopath." Right. But how often do we actually see that. When was the last time you saw someone doing that? But it can be you. Right. It can be you in your office, it can mean you between patients, it can be you for a few minutes in the morning, even at the coffee shop just drinking your coffee, just doing that one thing at a time. And as I like to say another way of thinking about mindfulness, to bring more mindful in our daily lives, just ask yourself, "What am I doing and how do I know I'm doing it?" And check in with your five senses. How do I know I'm sitting. One of my senses tell me, how do I know I'm listening? How do I know I'm speaking? What do my five senses tell me? Is our ways of killing us back toward mindfulness. So as clinicians that really starts with us and that's partly because some of us may remember this from… from graduate schools a number of studies that are proving this over and over again. But the top outcome measure in psychotherapy is not mindfulness, it's not CBT, it's not analytic theory, it's not anything you learned in graduate school, it's the quality of the relationship between the patient and the therapist, the client and the counselor. That's the number one predictor of outcome which means that we're a big part of that, which means that us working on ourselves as the most important tool in therapy, to be more present is one of the best ways we can help our patients and our clients. And I talk about this with uh… professionals that I work with, I'll talk about it with parents umm… and… and patients as well. Parents are better communication, greater family happiness and fewer accidents in the home. Educators have calmer kids. Therapists have patients who heal faster, feel more understood, feel more trust. Medical professionals likewise greater patient trust which (inaudible ) them following their prescription regimen and getting better because they're trusted, actually fewer lawsuits as well among doctors. All caregivers less the burnout, less turn over, reduced health care costs. And one of the most interesting studies of professionals practicing mindfulness for themselves took place in a group home (inaudible ) a number of years ago. A group home with difficult people living in that group home and they gave the staff a, it was a six week mindfulness based stress reduction course different (inaudible ) adapted from MBSR. What happened was that there were fewer restraints in that group home. Not ever having taught any single one of the residents of that group home about mindfulness, just teaching the staff. And to me that's because when we stay calm we see all of the tools at our disposal. We don't jump to conclusions about our patient's history or about their present or even about their future, we don't jump to the… the… the most powerful intervention, we jumped to the right intervention in that moment. And so I… I found that in particular of fascinating study. So it starts with our own practice that's gonna be the foundation of our patients practice. We also teach even if we never teach explosively our patients we teach them through our embodied presence of mindfulness. Teach them by being present for them not by being like this or like this. Right. We can also bear in mind that mindfulness and compassion really are contagious in terms of all the research on social contagion and mirror neurons or kind of transference or whatever we wanna call. We find, we can also find ways so here about this in some other presentations about finding and making consistent time for practice, finding and taking time out of the day for informal practice, strengthening our coffee or doing our notes. And one inspiration and idealism fact which happen for all of us when we start to get burned out, we always have our own practice to go back to. I wanna move toward, a little bit more of a positive psychology practice that I think can be helpful for our own self care. And it's just a matter of gratitude or appreciation practices that we can do. So often in our work we get burned out and the more burned out we get the more we just see those negatives everywhere. All right. We see all the… the struggling and the pain and the suffering. We forget to look for those bright spots, we forget to look for progress, we sit through staff meetings saying, "Well this person is struggling in this way and this person struggling in that way." And when we saw something we went to supervision or even just reflected on ourselves about which of our patients which of our clients are doing well. We can reset ourselves and get out of them umm… but it's taking a moment at the end of a session on our drive home, at the end of the day writing or even just reflecting for a moment on what went well. (inaudible ) you do this practice along with me, emerging from positive psychology. Just take a moment, eyes can be open or closed. 

00:58:25

00:58:30
CHRISTOPHER WILLARD I supposed to feel each breath as it comes in, goes back out. And just look back. Over the last week of the past few weeks or days, I just bring to mind something that's gone well. A patient who's done a little bit better, their moods improved, he went the week without cutting or drinking, stood up to their father. Just reflecting on what went well and you heard about it in that session. And as you reflect on it just bringing the image to mind but also noticing what happens in your body (inaudible ) any shift that occurs or not. Just breathing with that allowing both the image and the bodily embodied experience of this positive event, it just really take its time to sink in. If you like you can allow smile just to merge in your lips. And sing with that feels like from the inside. 

01:00:05
[sil.] 

01:00:15
CHRISTOPHER WILLARD So positive psychology they say our minds are tough one for the positive invoker for the negative. And what that means basically is that we're, we it takes us actually just a millisecond to encode a negative experience but it takes us more like 20 or 30 seconds to encode a positive experience into our schema into how we perceive the world. So it's like we take this time to just allow that 20 or 30 seconds for the experience to fully penetrate through our being. So we can re-encode a bad into how we look at the world, look at our patients, look at the progress that we're making that they're making. And really start to change our… our perspectives on then and on the work that we do. You can do this yourself, you can do it by talking about it, you can do it by reflecting with imagery, you can do it by creating a beautiful painting or a, or a poem about it, it doesn't matter it is taking that time to allow that positivity to sink in. So I wanna move on now towards talking a little bit about what's happening in the brain when we're practicing mindfulness. What we know about the brain is that it's far more plastic than it used to be. No plasticity essentially means that we can rewire our brain based on kind of how we think and act that actually changes what our brain becomes. And as we do that with anything really we can also do that with mindfulness, we rewire brains. So a colleague of ours (inaudible ) General Hospital put and her colleagues put some folks into MRI machines to see what's happening when they were meditating, what happened uh… when practicing mindfulness and what happened actually after eight weeks of practice. And what she found was really interesting. These are actually pictures of her images. There are a few parts of the brain that are active when we're practicing mindfulness that actually seem to grow denser after those few weeks of practice. So what that means is that her brain is basically like a muscle, right. If I go like this… this muscle is active if I go like this enough this muscle starts to get bigger, the same thing is true in different parts of our brain. So what are the parts of the brain that change with mindfulness? We can look at the slide that you see here. And so as if I'm facing in this direction, what we have up front that's the prefrontal cortex. But what do we know about the prefrontal cortex? It gets activated when we're practicing mindfulness and gets a little bit bigger and denser when we've been practicing for a while. What's interesting about the prefrontal cortex if you think back to graduate school, this is where our impulse control was. Right. This is where we are able to kind of make mental models, see the future, make plans, that's kind of the command and control center where executive function lives in the brain. It's a part of the brain that's smaller and people with ADD and impulse control disorder, it's a little bit smaller in terms of people umm… who are struggling with depression as well. And it's getting a little bit bigger when we're practicing mindfulness also allows us to process emotions a little bit more clearly and effectively more deeper… deeper into the brain. And in here we have the insular cortex much deeper in. A lot of us don't know quite as much about the insular cortex but that's getting activated, it's also getting bigger. That's where empathy or ability to take perspective, other people's perspective lives in that part of the brain as well. So that social cognition wise in terms of building relationships, connecting to others, having empathy and compassion. That part of the brain is smaller and people with umm… psychotic disorders whether it's (inaudible ) or umm… some… some bipolar disorders. And it's getting a little bit bigger in people when they've been practicing mindfulness or getting denser, other parts of the brain, the hippocampus moaning in memory over there, the temporal prattled junction that's also where we do a lot of our perspective taking. And also there's one part of the brain that's getting smaller if you recall back to the, start of the lecture you might remember what that is that's the medulla the medulla is getting much dense that's the brains fight or flight center. That's bigger and people that have experienced the trauma… trauma, it's bigger and people when they… umm… suffer from anxiety. And that's getting a little bit less dense and a little bit less active in people when they've been practicing mindfulness. So it's almost as if we think of the middle as the brain's alarm system, it's recalibrating that alarm system. So it's not going off at every trigger, it's going off, it's not shutting it off either it's getting recalibrated to go off at the right times. And it's one of those is not making us too relaxed or washy… washy or anything like that it actually makes us kind of more… more accurately able to read the situation. We get actually just as aroused but we recover faster. People there when practicing mindfulness in another study she wanted Dan Goldman's first studies. In other word on neural plasticity I find it really helpful to teach my clients about neural plasticity. The brain is how so many people now understand the world that when we talk about the brain it's much more real in a sense to people umm… then we just talk about how mindfulness feels good although that that subjective understanding is really important as well. What's more when we talk about changing the brain what starts to happen is that starts to shift our mindset. And if you study any of killed works work around fix mindsets and growth mindsets we learn that we can change our brain we learn that we can get better, we can still hope. And people start to get better when they feel like they're going get better. (inaudible ) to see improvements there. Plus I wish that I'm really (inaudible ). The brain science stuff so I encourage umm… you to explore a little bit more deeply if you like and certainly email us and ask us for more recommendations. But we're not just changing our brains (inaudible ) say recently, you know, the brain stuff that's old news here's the exciting stuff DNA is actually starting to change. How our genes express themselves is actually dependent on our stress epigenetic. Even when our ancestors many generations back experience the trauma that gets expressed in their genes and that gets passed on generation to generation to generation and actually affects us. Whether you believe in karma or whether you believe in genetics or whether you believe in neuroscience or all of it this is pretty exciting stuff because we can change people help them change their gene expression which they'll then pass on and actually heal the future and the kind of incredible way when we think about it. So with that exciting evidence there's also so much evidence in terms of mental health, in terms of mental functioning and flourishing. What else do we see? Improvements in concentration, improvements in creativity, fluid intelligence, patience, decision making, social skills, sustained attention and selective attention, learning in memory, depression, especially umm… chronic depression with people that are chronically relapsing from depression when they practice mindfulness based cognitive therapy, anxiety all kinds of anxieties including post-traumatic stress and obsessive compulsive disorders in addition to generalized anxiety disorders and phobias. What's more health an immune system functioning starts to boost and go up? People received uh… influenza vaccines and actually develop more antibodies after taking a mindfulness based stress reduction course. Those kinds of things not just changing our minds but changing our brains in a very real way changing our bodies stress, surgery recovery time and certainly sleep as well. And it doesn't have to be incredibly long practices they can be a little bit shorter. One of my favorites is this. Stop. You can do this together, can do it for minutes long, you can do it for just a moment, not to do it when I see a stop sign. After so often just stop what you're doing. Take a breath. And know that you're taking a breath. And then just observe for umm… sort of what's happening inside your body and mind. So it was happening in your surroundings and then just proceed and make a plan and proceed. So we do have all these little moments where we can do something like to stop practice between sessions. All right. Or, you know, like while we're waiting for coffee to brew or waiting in line at the bank we've got these little moments in fact I've been making a big list for my last book of, my first book a hundred things to do mindfully and my new book is trying to outdo myself with a hundred uh… reminders to be mindful. So here's in moments we can be mindful in daily life, you know, waiting in the bank, press the elevator button and, you know, we've got that little bit of time. I got to write 60 things on the list and I started to run out of steam. And then I noticed myself doing this every day, right, just mindlessly checking my messages refreshing my Facebook feed. Every time I go like this… this is a moment I can check in rather than check out. So just try… try that with your phone. Each time, it's not like, don't look at your phone just try checking in first before you check out with your phone. The practice I learned from umm… good friend of mine who was sitting on a two week retreat a couple years ago. He was finding his mind was going all over the place, couldn't sit still couldn't… couldn't get his mind to settle down. He went up to the teacher (inaudible ) Monk teaching the course that that year. He said, "How can my mind to be still?" And he said, "Just look… look to your surroundings. If you can't find any stillness within just look at something still in your surroundings the carpet, base of a tree and just breathe within. Take that external stillness." So if you can start to bring it inward.

CHRISTOPHER WILLARD A good one for anxiety or for trauma potentially. I like this picture that goes along with, this actually Sarah who did the brain scans actually told me. She said she learned, "Mindfulness is not about calming the storm it's about finding the calm within the storm." It's another wonderful way of understanding mindfulness. Another short body based practice our bodies are the source of so much information. And we have all these expressions, I think it's maybe in a mindfulness based cognitive therapy book that they were kind of talking about that right, butterflies in my stomach and cold feet and a frog in my throat. We have all these expressions that are emotional but that are about, you know, these bodily expressions. We all know what those things mean just because our bodies actually give us so much information. A lot of people believe it or share our… our emotions arise in our bodies, first our mind interprets them and that's when we end up having an emotion essentially. Right. If you think about the way anxiety… anxiety and excitement are very similar physiologically right, there is manifest in terms of father both feature focus the both high energy. But we can also take time in our sessions umm… or at any time and just check back in with our bodies and actually being aware having body awareness. Great New York Times article about this recently, the best performers from athletes to public speakers to other people in performance situations actually are always constantly checking in with in calculating the stress level in their bodies in terms of performance so checking in with their bodies on a regular basis throughout the session. All right. Like that experience I had a few weeks ago that uh… disclosure I heard and I just oh, you know, felt myself tightening, felt, you know, sort of like wave of notches in… in… in heat start to pour over me and be aware of that. This is just a short acronym practice called the calm reminder. I learned this from a colleague a number of years ago just take a moment your eyes to close or not. 

01:13:05

01:13:10
CHRISTOPHER WILLARD Just see sense for the chest, just notice sensations in your chest. Is there a tightness or relaxation see the heart rate pounding or slow, your breath (inaudible ). Your chest feel hot or cool, just now it's seems sensations in your chest. If you like you can even tense the muscles there and gently let them go. A stands for arms. What's happening in your arms? Are they still are they vibrating, slight tremor or your hands cool or warm, clammy, dry? What might that tell you? Curling into fists or just relaxed what information is that giving you? And just squeeze and release your arms. And, you know, when it's down into your legs and adrenaline situations we all know that Jackrabbit bounce in leg that feeling like we just wanna run out of there, just a feeling of tiredness and your legs at the end of a long day. When will your legs be communicating to you in this moment? Take a breath and shift your awareness back upwards just into your mind. What is in your mind in this moment? And taking the breath in and knowing that you're breathing in and taking a breath out knowing that you're breathing out. 

01:15:25
[sil.] 

01:15:30
CHRISTOPHER WILLARD That's the calm reminder. It's great for us as clinicians that so wonderful I want to share with our clients as well. So I'm moving forward a little bit more about our bodies. Another thing I learned recently is about the way our body and actually the source of so much of our wisdom so much of our deepest values gives us a lot of good information. We probably all have that experience of having a feeling in our gut or knowing in our heart that something is true. And I actually heard recently I think believe it was from killing McGonagle and… and then Siegel in a segment they did talk a little bit about umm… the fact that our nerve endings, you know, just and in our brain they go through our body with more nerve endings around our heart and in our gut than in any other part of our body. So when we say that's into your gut and listen to your heart. It's actually probably worth doing and it leads to an extent. So much of the work we do as therapist is intuitive. Right. We're at our best when we're when we're present. When we're when we're in the present moment and we're fully focused on our own experience within… within the moment and that can that can arise out of our bodies the body can be the source of your deepest wisdom. And so the quote goes. So one place where we get stuck and we can check in with our bodies in clinical decision making often do we get stuck. How many decisions you think we make in an hour and a 15 minute hour of therapy. And at the time we have no idea why we're doing it, right, with back at those reflection tapes. So why did I ask that question? Who knows, we can be a little bit more aware however and check in with our body before we make a decision. So let's do a little exercise together to train our intuition. I'll tell you to sit up straight. Ring the bell. Notice your breath. And bring to mind and body. A little bit of a clinical dilemma, nothing too big. Just a small one. In the question that client asked, in a moment when you cut yourself and you weren't quite sure where to proceed or wondering on the drive home. What you should do next? Bring that to mind bring that to body. And just a (inaudible ) that you makes a decision in one particular direction. Don't think about the consequences just pay attention to the sensations. The messages from deep within your body per a particular attention to your heart, to your gut as you imagine going with that decision. When you're hearing something maybe you're hearing nothing. Take a breath in take a breath out and mention that you're going in the opposite direction with a different decision cited in the other direction. And again just listening and sing, any sensations, anything happening, any shift in your heart or your gut not in words just embodied.

CHRISTOPHER WILLARD Few more moments. With this sensation take a breath. Fell go in feel go out. And take uh… another moment just to see if any other ideas arise listening to your gut, listening to your heart feeling any shift.

CHRISTOPHER WILLARD Perhaps there is something there, perhaps not. And just another breath in breath out.

CHRISTOPHER WILLARD I wanna say one last word on shifting empathy into compassion and we'll finish in just about a moment. So as I said we're all born with this empathy this is where Richie Davidson saw when he put people into MRI's and showed them scenes of suffering. And we all had these emotional reactions but not all of us not all the people in the MRI turn toward that suffering. When they encountered it many wanted to flee essentially or run away but some people their minds kind of looks like they wanted to stay with it. And what we can do in terms of other research uh… what Paul Condon found an interesting study a couple years back was that you can practice well in kindness, you can practice compassion training. And in that way you can strengthen that ability to keep turning toward those difficult moments in therapy, those difficult clients and… and… and all of the difficult content that we encounter on a day to day basis. And it's quite simple the very simple practice. It starts basically with just making friendly wishes. So let's make a few friendly wishes and that's compassion practice. And if your eyes open or closed I'll ring the bell. And then stop it as bringing to mind with someone who only wants the best for you. Maybe a mentor, (inaudible ) good relative, a known supervisor or professor. Imagine them making a wish for you and then imagine you making a friendly wish for them. Just feeling that.

CHRISTOPHER WILLARD Making a friendly wish for yourself. It doesn't have to be anything big it just some kind of friendly wish and you'd be safe and you'd be less burned out.

01:23:10
CHRISTOPHER WILLARD From there just to extend a wish to someone neutral person maybe a colleague, someone counter in the waiting room (inaudible ) friendly wish out to them. 

01:23:25

01:23:30
CHRISTOPHER WILLARD And from their friendly wish out to at the most difficult person but a somewhat difficult person maybe uh… somewhat difficult patient, maybe a somewhat difficult person in their life or in your own life so making a wish for them. A kind friendly wish. 

01:23:55

01:24:05
CHRISTOPHER WILLARD So that just practicing this on a regular basis truly builds that muscle of compassion keeping burn out that bad. And so for ourselves and our clients as the comedian said, 80% of life is just showing up. All right. That's what mindfulness teaches us to do to show up to attend, right, and ultimately to befriend whatever experiences come our way whatever patients walk through our door and…
