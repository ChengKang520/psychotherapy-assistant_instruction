SHANNON DERMER Welcome to Therapy Talks Powerful Ideas for Modern Practitioners. I'm Dr. Shannon Dermer from Governors State University and I'm hosting this series of innovative talks presented by Alexander Street Press. We will focus on important topics in counseling for the trainee, professional, and educator. Experts will offer solutions to some of the most challenging issues modern practitioners face. Today, we have the honor of Dr. John Sommers-Flanagan joining us. He is a professor of Counselor Education at the University of Montana. He is the former executive director of Families First Parenting Programs in Missoula, Montana and author of 'Adolescence How to Listen so Parents will Talk and Talk so Parents will Listen.' He has presented workshops for parents and professionals who want to work with parents throughout the United States. Many professionals complained that working with teenagers is one of the most difficult of all counseling tasks. He bust that myth and demonstrates why counseling teenagers is instead one of the easiest jobs on the planet in his therapy talk 'Why Counseling Difficult Teens is So Easy (Duh!)'. Welcome.

THERAPY Talks "Oh You Poor Teens With Your Under-Developed Brains" 

00:01:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Working effectively with difficult teenagers is very easy. I made a discovery a number of years ago that all you need to do is talk with them directly about this. And so what I did was I talk to my teenage clients and I would say things like 'Well, you know, I'm older, I'm more mature, I have a lot of life experience and, you know, your brain, according to the neuroscience research isn't even all hooked up. And so what about if you just sit and I tell you how to handle some things in your life?" Of course that's a lie and that's absolutely the wrong way to approach counseling teenagers. It was a miserable disaster. 

00:02:25
John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. 

00:02:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Really, uhm, I guess we should all know that teenagers need some respect, and so a lot of what I'm gonna talk about today has to do with respect. But even so, it's hard because we do have more life experience. It's very hard to not fall into that temptation of just telling teens what you think they should do. So that's why we need four profound secrets which I'm gonna talk about today to help you make counseling teenagers easier. I should say they're not really secrets partly because I'm not gonna whisper it all and you're free to tell them to whoever you would like to tell them to. And really the more like common sense although, you know, secrets sells better than common sense, so four profound secrets. That's what we're focusing on. 

00:03:20
Warning This THERAPY video is rated "R" for language commonly used among teens. Imagine 

00:03:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And I should say before I do the four profound secrets, uh, I wanna warn you this talk is rated R. And it's rated R for language. There's no nudity, no sexual scenes or anything like that. But when I have done work with challenging teenagers, sometimes they use profanity and so I'm gonna use a real story of when a particular client use some profanity. So first I'd like you just to imagine that you could take yourself right back in time to when you are a teenager. And you go back in time, and for whatever reason, you're a teenager again and someone tells you, you need counseling. And suddenly you find yourself in the room with the counselor, what would you say? You know, I've done this with some professionals and almost universally they say at the very least, this would be an uncomfortable situation. So that's why we need the four profound secrets to deal with the fact that counseling situation, the psychotherapy situation is a big obstacle for many teens. 

00:04:30
A BIG OBSTACLE to counseling 

00:04:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN If you think about it, how could we even imagine that they would think, "Oh, yeah, I think I'll go talk for an hour with a stranger who I never met about some of deep, personal problems." So four profound secrets. Here's a story to illustrate secret number one. Years ago, I was working with a 15-year-old teenager and, ah, it was the eighth session, and about 30 minutes into the session-- 20 minutes into the session I should say, I said something that really made him angry. And he looked at me in the eye and he said, "I'm not gonna say anything to you for the rest of this meeting except fuck you." Now I was a little bit surprised, ah, and so I did-- what I do when I'm surprised in counseling, I did my best to impersonation of Carl Rogers. And so I said back to this teenager, "So what I hear you saying is that maybe you're feeling a little bit angry right now." And you can imagine that one over. He said, "Fuck you." Now he's promised me that he would say only fuck you for the next 30 minutes and I'm thinking there's no way he's gonna last that long so I stick with my Carl Rogers' impersonation and I say, "Now, I don't know what it is but something I said really made you angry and I would love to hear whatever it was." And he said, "Fuck you." And then I said, "Well, you know, it doesn't even matter what it was. I would just like to say to you I'm sorry. I'm sorry for whatever I said that might have offended you." He said, "Fuck you." And he stuck with it. He was a persistent young man. About 20 minutes later, we got 10 minutes left, he's now not angry anymore but he's, ah, decided to sing it to me. And he's singing, "Fuck you." And so I go back to Carl Rogers and I say, "Before you were really angry in saying fuck you but now you seem pretty happy about it and you're singing it to me." 

00:06:30
John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. 

00:06:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so he spent the last 10 minutes just singing 'fuck you.' We get to the end of the session I say, "Looks like our time is up for today." He says fuck you, gets up to leave and I say, "Hey, I will see you next week." He looks over his shoulder and says to me one final fuck you. Now, this was a group home kid and so I knew he would be back because the group home staff would bring him back and they did. And so the next week he's sitting in the same chair, sits down and he looks me in the eye again. And I was ready for another session of fuck you or, part of me hope, maybe an apology. But instead-- and this is one of the things I love about working with teenagers-- they're really unpredictable sometimes. And instead he says to me, "How would you feel about adopting me?" That was another surprise. And I realized at the moment that, that session was gonna be in some ways much more challenging than 30 minutes of profanity. 

00:07:40
Profound Secret # 1 Accept, Accept, Accept... 

00:07:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And that secret, profound secret number one, accept, accept, accept what the teen client has to say even if it's 30 minutes of profanity. And even if you don't even know what that 30 minutes of profanity is about, accept what they have to say. Profound secret number one. So here's a story about secret number two. Uhm, 16, 17-year-old girl and working at a job corps, she tells me she's a self-proclaimed Satan worshiper and explains to me the Satanic golden rule. And this is a really important concept when it comes to counseling challenging teens. And so if you don't know what it is, the Satanic golden rule is 'Do unto others as they did unto you.' So, I remember when she told me this, I thought there's something wrong with this philosophy. This is not a good philosophy. First of all, it's a revenge philosophy. And we know revenge is a very impractical philosophy to live by because revenge begets revenge and tends to never end. As probably why someone invented the proverb, "He or she who lives by revenge should dig two graves." Revenge is impractical. But that's only part of what's wrong with that philosophy, the Satanic golden rule. The other part that's wrong with it is directly relevant to working with teenagers. And that is the other thing that's wrong with it is that it gives away personal power. If someone lives by 'do unto others as they did unto me,' they give away personal power. And so sometimes when I'm working with challenging difficult, nasty teenagers, partway to the session when things are going really well, I'll say-- you know, maybe it's 10 minutes and I'll say something like, "You know, I've heard that you can be really nasty and disrespectful to adults. But during this past 10 minutes, you've been nothing but nice and kind and respectful to me. Help me understand this." And almost always they just tell me straight up, it's the Satanic golden rule. They don't say it's the Satanic golden rule, but they tell me the same thing. They say, "The reason I'm being nice and respectful to you is because you are being nice and respectful to me." And then I can't help but also asked, "So are saying to me that if I wanted to, I could be disrespectful and I could get you to be disrespectful to me?" And they always say, "Yes. Yes, because that's my philosophy and that's how I rule." 

00:10:40
Profound secret # 2 Be respectful 

00:10:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I think respect is a really big deal for teenagers especially because in our culture today, ah, teenagers tend to be disrespected. Even the neuroscience literature has gotten into that. And as I started, we all talk about how maybe teenagers don't have fully developed brains. And of course they hear about this. But I have one thing to tell you about that. The truth is that teenage brains only tend to malfunction in an environment of disrespect and so if you respect teenagers, you will often get respect back. You get what you give, so give respect. Now, another story to try to illustrate profound secrets three and four. In a recent situation, I had a 17-year-old boy begin a therapy session like this. He said to me, "By the way, I wanna tell you to start I punched my last therapist." Again, kind of a provocative and surprising response, although it might have just been a factual disclosure from him from his perspective. And so it's not unusual for me to get that kind of start from a teenager. Ah, the worst ever I remember is someone-- one of the teenagers telling me, "I put my last therapist in the hospital." 

00:12:05
John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. I would NEVER want to say anything to you that would make you feel like punching me. 

00:12:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Now, when I get that kind of a provocative opening, I take it very seriously but maybe not in the way that you imagine. What I do in that kind of situation is I will say to the teenager, "Thank you so much for telling me that you punched your last therapist because I would never want to say something to you that would make you want to punch me. So how about we make a deal? If you even start feeling anything inside that is like making you think that you might wanna punch me, just tell me and I will stop talking about whatever it is and try to move to something different, because there is no way I wanna have that kind of relationship with you." You can see that this particular story illustrates profound secret one, be accepting, and profound secret two, be respectful, but it also illustrates secrets three and four. 

00:13:15
Profound Secret # 3 Create a safe space, be a safe person 

00:13:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Secret three is create a safe space. Focus on being a safe person. And the message back to this young man is I want this to be a safe place. I don't want it to be the kind of place where you're gonna feel so threatened that you think that you wanna punch me. 

00:13:30
Profound Secret # 4 

00:13:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And then the other part, secret four, is express your interest. Show what you're interested in and you're interested in the client a 100%. It's like you want the experience for the client to be like there's no other place that this therapist would rather be than with me here and now in this room. That's important for us to feel. But also we will convey our interest in having a good relationship with the teenage client. So we got secrets one through four. And secrets three and four are really all about finding a way to express safety and our interest. Now, let's summarize. Four secrets. 

00:14:15
A ccepting I nterested R espectful S afe 

00:14:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Number one, be accepting. Starts with an A. Number two, be interested. Show your interest. Starts with an I. Number three, be respectful. Starts with an R. Number four, have counseling be a safe place and have a safe relationship. Starts with an S. Now if you put those things together, it spells AIRS which is a nice acronym that helps us to remember the four profound secrets. However, I have a fifth. Now I know I said I had four, but sometimes when you work with teenagers, sometimes when you work with teenagers, surprising things happen and so we should be ready for them. And so we have a fifth, a surprise bonus profound secret. 

00:15:05
John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. P ositive A ccepting I nterested R espectful S afe 

00:15:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And the fifth one is be positive and fun when you can. And it starts with a P. And so we put a P in front of the AIRS and we work in PAIRS, positive, accepting, interested, respectful, and safe. That's a guideline for how we want to be with teenagers. Now let me give you more information what I mean by positive and fun. Being positive is pretty natural and pretty easy. It means focus on the teenager's strengths. That doesn't mean we avoid their problems, but take time to consciously focus on the teens' strengths and their qualities. Ask them what they think their good qualities are and then add some to that list. Really important to help them know that you see their strengths and their assets. And so being fun is also one of those things that comes pretty natural in sessions with teenagers. Ah, I have to admit that I even will resort to some bad jokes once in a while. Ah, my favorite anchor management joke and, uhm, this is very profound so you might wanna right it down, ah, is why did the ant crawl up the elephant's leg for the second time? Don't know the answer? The answer is because he got pissed off for the first time. Get it? Double meaning. Pissed off. Now I know that's a dumb joke, it's not that good, but I think also teenagers will appreciate your effort. And if nothing else, if you're working with angry teenagers using the word 'pissed off' tends to score some points for you. I also like to use sarcasm with teenagers. I call this 'emphatic sarcasm'. I say things like, "Well, you know, it's sounds to me like you're really enjoying your English teacher right now." And of course, I would say that one in fact all the evidence points to the contrary. Teenagers are very fluent in sarcasm and so it helps to use that. But we have to be careful and always use it emphatically sarcasm with the teenage client and not act the teenage client. 

00:17:20
John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. 

00:17:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so, in conclusion, I absolutely love working with teenagers, with difficult teenagers, because they're not even really difficult. They're just so-called difficult. The situation is what is difficult. How could we really expect teens to automatically benefit from a situation that for most of them is probably very foreign for them to go and talk with an adult about their personal problems? 

00:17:50
P ositive A ccepting I nterested R espectful S afe 

00:17:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so we need the PAIRS concept to help remember how to work most effectively with teenagers. Positive, accepting, interested, respectful, safe. And if you do that, what will you get? Well, you get what you give and much more. All you have to do is be positive, accepting, interested, respectful, and safe. And then somewhat surprisingly, you'll find that the teenagers find your advice about they should live to be much more interesting. Thank you for listening. 

00:18:40
THERAPY Talks 

00:18:45
SHANNON DERMER Thank you for that talk and working with teenagers, duh! 

00:18:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Thank you. 

00:18:50
SHANNON DERMER Uhm, I know a lot of times people are scared about working with teenagers. But like you, it's not my specialty but I do enjoy, ah, working with teenagers. For the most part, I think that we don't give them enough credit - 

00:19:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:19:00
SHANNON DERMER - sometimes. 

00:19:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:19:05
SHANNON DERMER Uhm, and I think they're-- ah, they tend to live up to whatever we expect of them - 

00:19:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Absolutely. 

00:19:10
SHANNON DERMER - which I guess is a core layer of wha-- of how you treat them as how to behave in some ways. 

00:19:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, yeah. I have found that teenagers are just very kind and respectful to me and so I feel like in some ways I wanna be a representative for them and say, "Hey, if you just treat them well, you're, you know, that doesn't mean they're gonna be perfectly cooperative but it is going to help so much." 

00:19:30
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:19:30
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. And, ah, you mentioned, uhm, if you know, you treat them with respect, they tend to treat, ah, you know, with respect. They may test you at it first like the, the fuck you story. 

00:19:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:19:40
SHANNON DERMER I can get away with saying that cuz it's - 

00:19:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:19:40
SHANNON DERMER - 'educational'. Uhm, but with that story, he tested you first to see if you truly would be respectful if you push your boundaries. 

00:19:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:19:50
SHANNON DERMER Uhm, and I'm wondering I think a lot of parents would say, "Oh, yes I'm, I'm respectful to my teenager." But do you think they're-- or can you think of some ways that maybe parents are unintentionally disrespectful to their kids? 

00:20:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, absolutely. I think parents do that all the time. And one example might be just if a, if a teenager is interested in certain kind of music, right? The parent kinda just puts that off. He doesn't even pay much attention to it. Maybe a teenager comes and starts complaining about the teacher and the parents inclination will, "Well what did you do?" 

00:20:20
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:20:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN "What did you do to set the, the teacher off?" And all those things don't involve respect. They involve a little bit of a dismissive attitude. I think a lot of times, ah, we have dismissive attitude of teenagers emotions and parents do that a lot. It was like, "Oh, come on, really seriously?" You're just being a teenager. Well, no, you're being a teenager who's upset and almost always, as we know from counseling adults, teenagers, children, emotions come from somewhere. 

00:20:50
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. So, that's good. So one of the ways then that, uhm-- cuz I think sometimes there will be disagreement if you ask the teenager or the parent like, - 

00:20:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Absolutely. 

00:20:55
SHANNON DERMER - "Is your parent respectful?", uhm, that maybe it's not this intentional, like, swearing at your kid or being mean to your kid or-- but more being dismissive especially with teenagers who we perceived as maybe over-reacting, being melodramatic, you know, - 

00:21:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:21:10
SHANNON DERMER - that were dismissive toward them. 

00:21:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I think that's true, you know, and I think a lot of times, uhm, another thing that helps us to be kind of explicitly and proactively respectful, you know, you see something on the news, you're watching a television show with your teenager, ask your teen, "What do you think?" 

00:21:30
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:21:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And even if the teens opinion is absolutely ludicrous, it's still okay to have a conversation about it because I think one, one of the things-- the metaphors I've used, uhm, with the teen brain is it's sort of like a wild stallion and it just want to run and it wants to argue. 

00:21:45
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:21:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So, argue about politics, argue about television shows and the lyrics to songs, engage that teenage brain. But when it comes to whether or not your teenager really got the bathroom clean, you don't argue about that. 

00:22:00
SHANNON DERMER Oh, that's a really good point. In fact, uhm, in fact, you're going someplace else different with that first, but I like that. You can debate your teenager about other things and things that are set rules in your - 

00:22:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:22:10
SHANNON DERMER - house. You don't debate your, your priorities. 

00:22:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Exactly. 

00:22:10
SHANNON DERMER You debate other things. I like that, the wild styling(ph). Ah, I actually just co-wrote a chapter that will be coming out with, ah, doctor-- a student of mine, her name is Molly Bachenberg and we were actually talking about-- talking to adolescents of about sexuality - 

00:22:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh-hmm. 

00:22:25
SHANNON DERMER - and sex. 

00:22:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh-hmm. 

00:22:25
SHANNON DERMER And one of, one of the things was to watch the television shows with them. There some research that says that if you, uhm, watch it with them and discuss it but they're more likely to take your opinion in account, not lecture them but discuss it - 

00:22:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:22:40
SHANNON DERMER - and really sincerely engage in a debate or a discussion or conversation that you can let them know, ah, your values without being dismissive of theirs. 

00:22:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Exactly. 

00:22:50
SHANNON DERMER And that's a great, that's a great way to stimulate, that word, sexual discussions with your, with your teenagers, you know, and, and as we know, you're not just gonna have one sex talk with your teenager - 

00:23:00
SHANNON DERMER Right. 

00:23:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN - or with your pre-teen. It's talking about sex through childhood and through adolescence so that you can be the kind of parent who is so respectful of your teen that, you know, he or she is gonna come to you as an adult and ask you about issues, uhm, and concerns about sex or other things. 

00:23:20
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, I find, ah, somewhere-- we were actually talking a little bit before you're doing that talk, uhm, and also doing your, your talk, you know, you're talking about being respectful and, uhm, and I think that having those open conversations-- and again, we were talking a little bit earlier before the talk about lecturing. I think that's another way - 

00:23:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh-hmm. 

00:23:35
SHANNON DERMER - to be dismissive - 

00:23:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh-hmm. 

00:23:40
SHANNON DERMER - of your teen is to lecture. So, if you can talk about taboo topics or important topics with an open mind, you don't have to agree, but - 

00:23:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:23:50
SHANNON DERMER - with an open mind and not lecture and instead listen to what your teen has to say. They are more likely to come to you and discuss difficult topic. 

00:23:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Absolutely. It's about engaging and being interactive and working with teenagers, you know, we've kind of gone into parenting here and of course that's a different - 

00:24:05
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:24:05
John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. 

00:24:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN - therapy talk. But it's, it's so important for parents to recognize that the lecture is not at all for the teenager. 

00:24:15
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:24:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN The lecture is for the parent. 

00:24:15
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:24:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And so if you need to mark it on to your calendar and get on your soapbox or from your poppet and do a lecture for your teenager, do it. But don't confuse that with parenting, right? 

00:24:30
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:24:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Just check that off your list cuz it was something you felt that you needed to do. 

00:24:30
Shannon Dermer, Ph.D. 

00:24:30
SHANNON DERMER Right. And literally while the students are just saying, "I'm getting on my soapbox now, you know, - 

00:24:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:24:35
SHANNON DERMER - you can listen to this or not, listen to this." 

00:24:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:24:40
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:24:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, and I think parents need to do that, too. But counselors, psychotherapists also - 

00:24:40
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:24:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN - need to sort of say, ah, this is lecturing my teen or - 

00:24:45
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:24:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN - teen client is just not gonna be effective. And so how can we make this more interactive? 

00:24:50
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. And I do find that-- I mean, although, you know, that slipped into parenting a little bit, which you will be talking about in a different talk, but, uhm, that, ah, some, ah, counselors or therapists do slip into that parenting role when they're working with teenagers. 

00:25:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right, right. And that, you know, can be good and can be not so good. 

00:25:10
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:25:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN The really important for us to remember as therapists that we're not the parent and that the teenager goes home to the parent. And that might be a case for bringing the parent into counseling, right? 

00:25:20
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:25:20
John Sommers-Flanagan, Ph.D. 

00:25:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It might be a good reason to do that. But also it ha-- we-- well, you know, we're not going to adopt - 

00:25:25
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:25:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN - those - 

00:25:30
SHANNON DERMER No. 

00:25:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN - clients. 

00:25:30
SHANNON DERMER That was that both, uhm, inspiring and sad story in some ways when he wanted-- because you're a patient, because you are kind, because you are respectful, all those things that you are talking about, and, ah, some had a sense of humor that, ah, you said, "You're, you're the person that want to adopt me." 

00:25:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah, and what was interesting to me in that experiences he didn't say, "Would you adopt me?" And that I think is common for teenagers who've had some maybe challenging living situations and they feel abandoned. He said, "How would you feel about adopting me?" - 

00:26:00
SHANNON DERMER Ah. 

00:26:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN - which really opened us up to a conversation. And he never did ask me partly because I said to him, "Well, let me just be honest." And I was honest to him about some of the violent behaviors that he had engaged in previously and then we got into discussion about that. And it was not especially pleasant conversation - 

00:26:20
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:26:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN - that session either, ah, and yet I felt like it was genuine and it was deeper. And I think you're absolutely right when you said earlier about testing. We see that a lot with adolescents with teenagers. He test the parents and they test their therapists. 

00:26:35
SHANNON DERMER Yeah, when I think again what you're heading on is being genuine, being honest, ah, paired with low reactivity - 

00:26:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Uh-hmm. 

00:26:40
SHANNON DERMER - for the most part as a, as a counselor or therapist and I found that a-- you know, again, teenagers will live up to your expectations. I remember I did a, a group therapy thing with kids who were in, uhm, ah, family preservation, you know, we're trying to prevent them - 

00:26:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right. 

00:26:55
SHANNON DERMER - from getting remove, what we did we invited them to the, uhm, to the, ah-- to do like, it's a group thing and they wanted to talk about sex. And a lot of people thought, "Oh," cuz it was mixed boys and girls. 

00:27:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:27:05
SHANNON DERMER That, oh, this will just be a fiasco. But we had them write down questions and put it into a bowl and then we pulled them out and they-- because we treated it seriously. They treated it very seriously. 

00:27:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:27:15
SHANNON DERMER I was actually impressed - 

00:27:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:27:15
SHANNON DERMER - that we-- again, I don't think, like you said, we give teenagers enough credits sometimes. 

00:27:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Right, right. That's a great example, I mean, and, and you followed some really good procedures there because you do not wanna have them just start to ask questions spontaneously- 

00:27:30
SHANNON DERMER Uh-hmm. 

00:27:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN - partly because of the old Adlerian thing of, you know, seeking attention. 

00:27:35
SHANNON DERMER Uh-huh. 

00:27:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Wow, they will get into a competition about who can have the funniest or weirdest question. But if you have them write those down, you kinda take away that at-- attention-seeking part and then you can have a very mature and genuine discussion about it. 

00:27:50
SHANNON DERMER Oh, it's unintentionally smarter than I thought. Thank you for having credibility to that. I had no wonder you do well with teenagers. 

00:27:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Well, I think really, you know, I, I did mention focus on strengths and I think that is a really important thing with teenagers. You said another important thing I think low reactivity, you know, w-- 30 minutes of 'fuck you' I knew it wasn't about me, - 

00:28:10
SHANNON DERMER Yeah. 

00:28:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN - right? 

00:28:15
SHANNON DERMER So you didn't personalize it? 

00:28:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I didn't personalize it. I didn't need to personalize it. I'm not be worth of a couple of fuck yous but 30 minutes, I just didn't do that much. 

00:28:20
SHANNON DERMER You hadn't earned that. 

00:28:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN No, I hadn't earned that. 

00:28:25
