TWINET PARMER Hello, I'm Twinet Parmer, professor of Counselor Education at Central Michigan University. You are about to view a four session sexuality counseling role-play with a couple, Phil and Stacy. Phil is a 33-year-old male of Native American and Caucasian descent. Stacy, his wife of five years, is 36 years old and does not identify closely with any cultural group. They have one child, 3-year-old, Stacy. According to the information provided, both Phil and Stacy identify as a hetero… as heterosexuals, who are in a monogamous relationship, with no history of infidelity. When asked what brought them into counseling, Phil and Stacy agreed that they have, that they have relationship and communication issues that contributed to ongoing marital conflict for about a year. More specifically, Phil stated that their relationship was no longer satisfying and that he no longer felt close to his wife. Stacy felt that given her level of anger and frustration, she could no longer communicate with Phil. As a result, they argue and find it difficult to connect, creating greater distance between one and other. They want to work on being close again.

00:01:55
TWINET PARMER Well, hello, umm… Stacy and Phil. Uh, good to have you back again. Umm… when I last saw you, we did some intake information. We didn't get a lot of detail at that time. Uh… today, I would like for us to revisit that. But before we do that, I would like to ask if either of you had questions about what happened in the last session, the last time I saw you. 

00:02:25
[sil.] 

00:02:30
PHIL Umm… I didn't. Did you have any? 

00:02:35
STACY Hmm… No, I didn't have any. 

00:02:35
TWINET PARMER Okay. That's' fine. And if you do, just feel free to. You can stop at any point and ask us about, ask me about questions or questions to one another and express your concerns. Okay, let's, uh, begin by having you tell us something about, you may be tell us a little bit more about the intake that you had… you wrote last week. Phil, why don't you start by telling us something about who you are? 

00:03:05
PHIL Umm… well, I, you know, I'm 33-year-old man. Umm… I'm Native American and I'm also Caucasian. Umm… I was raised around the area, so I'm familiar with the reservation and dominant white culture. Umm… lately, I've been learning a lot more about my culture. 

00:03:25
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. 

00:03:25
PHIL And I'm currently in between jobs. 

00:03:30
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. 

00:03:30
PHIL Umm… we have a 3-year-old child that I'm currently taking care of. Umm… we've been married for five years? 

00:03:35
STACY Yeah, five. 

00:03:40
PHIL Five years. Uh, we met at a conference. We… Uh, we've just been going through a difficult patch. 

00:03:45
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. 

00:03:45
PHIL So I want you to tell us, I think, may be some communication. We're just not meeting at the same level, I guess. I don't know. 

00:03:55
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. Stacy, why don't you tell us something about who you are? 

00:04:00
STACY Umm… I'm 36. And like Phil said, we've been married, uh, five years and we have a wonderful daughter, umm… 3-year-old, her name is Stacy. Uh… I'm… I work in the helping professions, that I focus on, uh, trauma therapy and, uh, poetic therapy, actually poetry therapy. That's my, my area. And, uh, yeah, we… I agree, we've had a lot of, umm… conflict uh… in our relationship, communication problems. 

00:04:40
[sil.] 

00:04:45
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. Okay, so it seems as though you both agree that there is an issue with communication. Umm… we can come back to that. Let's get a little bit more general information about you. Umm… tell me about, uh, something about your family, Stacy. 

00:05:00
STACY Okay. Well, my parents are umm… still married. I have two younger siblings, uh, two sisters. We're all two years apart. I'm the oldest. Uh… my parents, umm… are both accountants. And umm… I was brought up very strict Catholic. I went to Catholic school. Uh… being the oldest uh… kind of, had a lot of pressures on me, to be a certain way. And they had really high expectations. And umm… I'm close with my mom and dad, umm… but I feel a lot of, umm… I don't go to mass very much, rarely anymore. And, uh, I've a lot of guilt about that sometimes. Umm… and, and, you know, Phil was raised very Catholic, but very differently than, than my family, it was very strict, very rigid. 

00:06:05
TWINET PARMER So tell me something about your family, Phil, that you think is important for us to know. 

00:06:10
PHIL Umm… you know, again, I was raised in the area, so I, you know, umm… I was raised Catholic. Umm… but there has been, kind of, a resurgence of traditional teachings in our area. Umm… I've been, kind of, going to some meetings. And umm… re-connecting with, you know, some of the stuff that was lost, you know, uh, with the boarding school. I actually had relatives that went to the boarding school here in the town. And, umm… Yeah, so my parents were, kind of, open to other ideas, into other religions And umm… And I've been exploring some of those. 

00:06:45
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. So you're saying you're, you're trying to reconnect or connect with your native culture. 

00:06:50
PHIL Yes. 

00:06:55
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. Prior to this time, uh, have you, uh… been involved with the native culture? 

00:07:00
PHIL No. No, it's, uh, umm… you know, the tribe is very… umm… Nobody had any money for a long time and umm… with recent things changing, you know, the money has brought about some resurgence in culture because people can afford to do some of that stuff, too. Look at the culture, to do some of the research, and to umm… bring people in, you know, and they are helping in a good way. So umm… it's… like you said, it's, kind of, it's still growing. And still, kind of, early in its stages. 

00:07:35
TWINET PARMER What about your culture? Are you involved? How would you identify in terms of your culture? 

00:07:45
STACY Uh… Well… Pretty much Americanized, I guess. You could say my roots are ethnistic, ethnicity is umm… uh, like Irish, German, Welsh, Scottish, English, that, kind of, area. But, uh, we… Everything is so Catholic in my family that everything was Catholic umm… based, following the umm… that culture here is America with the Catholicism. 

00:08:10
TWINET PARMER So sounds like you're like most of us, a mutt, you know, with a mixture with lot of things. 

00:08:15
STACY A mutt. Right, right. 

00:08:20
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. Yeah. Do you sometimes feel that way, Phil? 

00:08:20
PHIL Yeah, definitely. I… You know, I was, I was raised in, you know, dominant, you know, just… you know, western culture and umm… But again, you know, I like the option of looking at some other ideas and to always, kind of, grow for, I guess. 

00:08:40
TWINET PARMER Stacy, have you been involved in the Native American culture, since Phil is, umm… is learning about his culture? 

00:08:50
STACY Uh… Not, not really. Not so much. Umm… he really umm… spends a lot of his focus on it. And… uh, I… I have such a hard time anyway with our communication right now that it really hasn't umm… I really, I really wanted him honestly to be more focused on, on finding a job umm… right now than… It's been… it's been… it's, it's an issue for us. So I haven't really spent umm… a lot of time. 

00:09:25
TWINET PARMER How does that feel, umm… to, uh, know that your wife is not spend a lot of time in some thing you care about? 

00:09:35
PHIL Well, you know, it, kind of, comes back to that connection thing and, you know, I uh… I just feel like we're not going in the right… in the same path, right now. And you know, I know, she wants me to get a job and I'm looking. And, you know, it's just… It's tough out there now. There is, there is not a lot of opportunity. You know, we are fortunate to have one but, you know, right now, I'm taking care of our child. And usually when she is getting home, I'm going to meetings, so. 

00:10:05
[sil.] 

00:10:10
TWINET PARMER Tell me how you would respond to what Phil just said? 

00:10:15
STACY Umm… When umm… When Phil mentioned that he, he is taking care of Stacy which is a big help, our daughter. And umm… when I get home, I'm more than happy to take care of my child, but Phil leaves. He goes to these meetings and again there is… it just doesn't seem like… It seems like we're coexisting in the same place, but we don't have a connection. It's, it's dissipated. And he is not there a lot 'cause he is doing the native work and being involved, and… 

00:10:50
TWINET PARMER Would you agree with that… assessment? 

00:10:55
PHIL Yeah, I mean, yeah, you know, I… be we are at… I think, she, kind of, said the same thing, that we're just on different paths right now. We're not umm… We, we, kind of, pass each other everyday. 

00:11:10
STACY Pretty much. 

00:11:15
TWINET PARMER And it sounds like that goes back to that communication issue that we will… that might be something that you all want to work on. 

00:11:20
STACY Mm-hmm. 

00:11:25
TWINET PARMER Communication as an issue? 

00:11:25
STACY Mm-hmm. 

00:11:25
TWINET PARMER Okay. But I'd like to continue with some other intake information. I like to have a good picture of what you two look like. Oh, tell me about families, uh, in terms of closeness. Uh, Phil, how close are you to your family and how close are you to Stacy's family? 

00:11:45
PHIL I'm very close with my family. Umm… I have two brothers and a sister and me. We hang out all the time. Umm… they come over all the time and I go over to my folks house. You know, it's pretty close-by. And, you know, some of them are getting into some of the same stuff that I'm getting into and we've been able to… we're building some more, you know, closeness even, even more lately, that's, kind of, nice. Well, with Stacy's family, sometimes I, umm… I feel a little distant. Umm… her mom's, kind of, a die hard, umm… when it comes to some religion stuff. And umm… yeah. 

00:12:30
[sil.] 

00:12:35
TWINET PARMER What you mean "a die hard?" 

00:12:35
PHIL Umm… 

00:12:35
TWINET PARMER In terms of religion stuff. 

00:12:40
PHIL She… You know, I bring up some of the stuff that I've, you know, learned or doing and, uh, it… You just get the feeling like she doesn't umm… appreciate or even care to even hear it some times, umm… kind of, just closes off to it. 

00:12:55
[sil.] 

00:13:00
TWINET PARMER Stacy, umm… tell me about your relationship with Phil's family and your family. 

00:13:05
STACY Okay. Well, with my family… it's, kind of, hard to explain. We're close, but we're not very close. I didn't have… We weren't very touchy feely or very nurturing type of close. Uh, both my sisters live in different states from me. Umm… I do spend time with my parents. But it's a lot of umm… chit-chat, surface chat, there is not a lot of umm… depth, I guess. I mean, I love my parents. I feel they love me. 

00:13:40
[sil.] 

00:13:45
STACY Umm… but everything has always been about rules and structure. So… Umm… And as far as, as Phil's family goes, I'm… I've always liked Phil's family. Umm… lately, it's been a little bit harder for me because when I have been around them, it's all about this… the native excitement around there. And I don't feel like I'm a part of that umm… I feel left out from that. Umm… so that makes it umm… uncomfortable. 

00:14:15
TWINET PARMER So it sounds as though you're saying that's another way that you're just, you're not close to Phil and unable to communicate. But would you agree with that, Phil? 

00:14:30
PHIL Yeah, we… We, we kind of don't… Yeah, I mean, my family is definitely very much into that. Umm… you know, she is usually working and you know, we are meeting up all day, so. 

00:14:50
STACY But it's, but it's true. I mean, I do feel… I feel left out. I don't know why I can't be more… I guess I don't know if it's 'cause it's I'm not Native American or what, but I do feel left out from that. 

00:15:10
TWINET PARMER But say more about being left out. Help us understand that feeling. 

00:15:20
[sil.] 

00:15:25
STACY May be it's more of a neglect… feeling umm… Umm… I… you know how you can be in a room with people and still be lonely. It's, it's… I feel… It saddens me actually because for the long… I mean, Phil and I have always been encouraging and celebratory of each others… And it's, like he said, it's just as, it's gone… it's on two paths now. We just don't know where we are. 

00:15:55
TWINET PARMER It seems as though this is a little perplexing to you. 

00:16:00
STACY It is. I don't know, what, what, where… What went wrong along this… where all this conflict, I mean. I've some idea with, with stresses, life stresses. But it just seems like we're, I just don't really talk, we don't talk to each other. 

00:16:25
TWINET PARMER Phil, do you feel at all felt out with Stacy? 

00:16:30
PHIL Umm… yeah, I mean. Sometimes, you know, when she comes home, it's like, you know, I don't. Sometimes I'm cooked up with, with, uh, Stacy Jr. and all that, you know, all day and we're, we're hanging out. You know and sometimes, I need a break, too. And, you know, she comes home, she wants a break and, you know, and I understand she is bringing home, you know, she's supporting us right now. And, I'm, kind of, like between jobs and umm… We're, I mean we aren't talking, we're, we're almost exhausted. It is like, you know, kind of, like just a partnership and kind of… We aren't talking. 

00:17:10
TWINET PARMER So you're saying you're not talking and you mentioned exhaustion. 

00:17:15
PHIL Mm-hmm. 

00:17:15
TWINET PARMER Yes, being exhausted. Is, is that the reason why you're not talking or they're other reasons that prevents you from talking? 

00:17:25
PHIL Well, you know, I guess, sometimes it's, you know, umm… Stacy wants the best for the family and, you know, and I want to get working, too. But seems like every conversation we have is about umm… getting back to work, really. And, and it's not a bad thing. And I'm looking but you know, sometimes I feel like I avoid that. 

00:17:50
TWINET PARMER He says he's looking. Do you… You mentioned early… your earlier something about how he, when he should be looking for a job, uh, and rather than doing what he is doing with family or learning about being Native American. 

00:18:10
STACY Yeah, he, he… He spends so much time invested in the native culture and, and learning, and being involved, that I feel like the job is, kind of, pushed aside. I think that's important, umm… not that he needs to push aside his culture and identifying with that. But we need money, too. I mean, we're having some financial issues. I, I, and I think, it's, you know… I don't have a lot of tolerance for it like, I guess that's what I'm saying, when he needs to be looking for a job, even if's not in this field. 

00:18:55
TWINET PARMER So it sounds like Phil is saying, I'm looking for a job. But I value my experience, what I'm learning as, about been part Native American. And this is exciting to me and may be reinforcing your identity in that regard. 

00:19:25
PHIL Yeah, it, it definitely is. And I, you know, I look forward to it whenever, kind of, identifying who I really am. You know what I mean and… And that is a part of me and it's important to me. 

00:19:35
TWINET PARMER Is that something that you've involved little Stacy in? 

00:19:40
PHIL Umm… we've taken her to a couple. We've taken her to a couple of things. So umm… just introducing her, you know, into some things. 

00:19:55
TWINET PARMER Stacy, is this something you do with Phil? 

00:20:00
STACY Uh… Well, like he said, we have done a few family things with Stacy. Uh, you know, being that she is native as well in her blood. Umm… I do want her to be able to know her… the culture and every, every side of it, I guess. But it, it… again, it comes down to, he is so focused on it. That it's like, you're talking about… he was talking about his identity. But he also has an identity as bringing, you know, helping support the family, and being the father, and… he is a great father, don't' get me wrong. Phil's a great dad to Stacy. But he is also my husband, you know, and, and I feel like that's important, too. And I don't feel that closeness. 

00:20:50
TWINET PARMER Umm… Do I hear you saying, "I don't feel that he feels as close to me as his wife." 

00:21:00
[sil.] 

00:21:05
STACY Yeah. That's, sort of, exactly right. That… There is… Everybody has priorities. And I don't except to be number one all the time or, you know, that's not what I'm not getting at. But I do feel like, our marriage has really been pushed on to the back burner. 

00:21:25
[sil.] 

00:21:30
TWINET PARMER And, Phil, what are you thinking now? 

00:21:35
PHIL You know, I… I'm hearing her, you know, talk about all that stuff and just thinking about, you know, some of the stuff we are doing. I mean, we, we do have a very busy life. You know, even with me out, without me working, you know, she works long hours trying to, you know, take care of the family, you know, financially. And, you know, I'm helping with, you know, with our child and you know, and working on myself as well. And umm… kind of that balancing act and it, kind of, sounds like we might be able to do a lot of balance. 

00:22:10
[sil.] 

00:22:15
TWINET PARMER Umm… Let's move on to some of the other things that were in the uh… that was in the, uh, uh, intake. Umm… you all indicated you had had, previously had individual counseling before you were married? Say a little bit about that, Stacy. 

00:22:35
STACY Umm… Actually, my counseling was even before I met Phil. Umm… It was when I was in graduate school. And, uh, I, uh, and I think that goes back to my parents' expectations. I have such high expectations. I was having a lot of stress. And, uh, my family doctor recommended I see a psychiatrist. So I did go to a psychiatrist, umm… was prescribed anxiety medication which helped. Umm… and I also saw counselor to help me deal with the anxiety. Umm… It was just a very stressful time. Uh, and I no longer take medication, you know, but right now, I do feel, I do feel, I do feel some anxiety, so. 

00:23:25
TWINET PARMER And rightly so, I'm sure, and that's understandable. 

00:23:30
STACY Yeah. I worry and, and ruminate and fret about us a lot. And that, that, that bothers me. 

00:23:40
TWINET PARMER Phil, what about you? I think on the intake, you indicated something about having gone to individual counseling, some years ago. 

00:23:50
PHIL Mm-hmm. Yeah, that was a, a long time ago. This, again, in my graduate program and currently, I'm still going to some groups and stuff, it's like more of that. Uh, just, uh, they call it talking circle. It's an Native American umm… tradition, where you basically pass an eagle further all the way around. And you're allowed to speak what's on your mind and be heard all the way around, so. 

00:24:15
TWINET PARMER Sounds interesting. 

00:24:20
PHIL I used to do that about once a week. Was I, right? 

00:24:25
TWINET PARMER Okay. Umm… You indicated that you're currently not taking any medications. What about you, Phil? 

00:24:30
PHIL None. 

00:24:30
TWINET PARMER Not taking medications. Umm… Umm… you all did not share any experiences, didn't indicate that you had experiences with sexual abuse, umm… substance abuse, any illegal issues. You said you had none of those? Uh-huh. And there was no umm… indication that any suicide indi… ideations or anything like that. Uh, what about you, Stacy? Has that ever been an issue for you? 

00:25:10
STACY Hmm… No. Umm… a lot of that goes back to my religious upbringing. Umm… that would be a horrible sin umm… based on how I was raised. And, and also I think, I was strong enough that it just, well, I didn't want to disappoint my parents. And that's something that would never have really crossed by mind because of those reasons, so no. 

00:25:35
TWINET PARMER What about you, Phil, in terms of the suicide, issues with suicide, thoughts of it? 

00:25:40
PHIL I have never had any, any thoughts of it. 

00:25:45
TWINET PARMER Okay. Good. Umm… When, when I see a couple, I usually ask them, uh, well, about their level of commitment to this marriage. On a scale, Phil, on a scale of one to five, with five being high, how committed are you to this marriage? 

00:26:05
PHIL Seeing like a strong four. 

00:26:10
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. Four? And what does strong four mean? 

00:26:15
PHIL Umm… it means that we've been, we've been through a lot, and obviously we want to work on our, our relationship. Umm… But, you know, there is some stuff that we need to work on. 

00:26:30
TWINET PARMER So you want to be in this relationship with Stacy. Stacy, same thing for you. Umm… How… On a scale of one to five, how committed are you to this relationship and marriage? 

00:26:45
STACY Uh, same number that Phil gave you, a four. I do. We're here, like he said, because we want, we need help. We need to find ourselves joy in our, our marriage again, I guess. 

00:27:05
TWINET PARMER And I'm hearing you say that you're committed to each other, the things that I've… We've talked about so far today. And you're saying you're also committed to this marriage. Another question, I like to ask, on a scale of one to five, how would you rate your quality of life, at this time, Stacy? 

00:27:25
[sil.] 

00:27:30
STACY I, uh… I guess, I would go with three, three-and-a-half. 

00:27:35
[sil.] 

00:27:40
STACY And that being based on the communication problems, my… the job, and the need of focus umm… My anxiety is not helping, I mean, that's creating. And so that's adding on to a three-ish number, too. And just not being, not feeling together, so. 

00:28:05
TWINET PARMER So I hear you saying that that three, three-and-a-half is about your current situation. Would you say that at another point in the past, you would've rated your quality of life, may be, give it a higher score. 

00:28:25
STACY Mm-hmm. Definitely. 

00:28:30
TWINET PARMER And so you're saying that the things that have changed recently over the past year, that you've already talked about here, contribute to that three. 

00:28:35
STACY Definitely. 

00:28:40
TWINET PARMER Phil, in terms of same, same question, in terms of your quality of life, on a scale of one to five, how would you rate, with five being high, how would you rate that? 

00:28:55
PHIL Umm… pretty close to hers. I would say probably two-and-a-half, may be three. Umm… just, you know, it's tough right now. Umm… we're, we're struggling. Umm… The relationship is struggling. And we're both, you know, we're… It almost seems like we're doing this by ourselves. 

00:29:15
TWINET PARMER Doing it by yourselves, say more about that. 

00:29:20
PHIL Uh, well, you know, again, you know, she is working all day and, you know, taking care of our child. Umm… She is taking care of us financially and I'm taking care of our children, I know. And I'm looking for job and umm… you know, we're not helping each other may be. 

00:29:45
TWINET PARMER Relative to the intake information, is there anything else you wanted to add? 

00:29:50
[sil.] 

00:29:55
TWINET PARMER What you would like to point out at this time before we start looking at what brought you in? 

00:30:00
STACY No, no. I don't, I don't think so. 

00:30:05
TWINET PARMER Any questions, at this point? 

00:30:05
STACY No. 

00:30:10
TWINET PARMER Okay. Umm… Tell me, umm… Phil, what brought you in? Now I've heard you talk about your communication and so on, tell me what brought you, what made you, as part of this team, finally decide to come in and address some of these issues that have been going on for a year? 

00:30:35
PHIL Umm… Well, you know, just both of our, kind of, our stress levels and umm… you know, the financial strain and umm… you know, of me looking for a job, umm… taking care of our child and she is working a lot. Umm… And I remember back to thinking about all those previous counseling sessions and umm… going through school and how much they've helped. And umm… it was, kind of, you know, one of the things, I think, you know, we finally came to an agreement together on, to come in. 

00:31:10
TWINET PARMER And what about you, Stacy? What would you say brought you in today? 

00:31:20
STACY I'm really worried about my marriage. I'm really concerned about… our marriage. And related to umm… the conflict we have, the distance. 

00:31:35
[sil.] 

00:31:40
STACY Umm… uh, all those issues and they're all, kind of, you know, we, we argue. And then when we argue, it's like it gets swept under the rug. It's the same… crap next time and, and… It's just heavy. It feels heavy, weighing, weighing me down, at least for me. 

00:32:05
TWINET PARMER Would you say, you have some of those same feelings? 

00:32:10
PHIL Yeah. Umm… I think a lot of our stuff, we just didn't never quite fully gets resolved. We just go over it again and again. That's what we usually argue about. 

00:32:20
TWINET PARMER I heard that theme of communication over and over, would you say that communication issue is the over-riding theme in all of this. If you sweep it under the rug, how are you talking about it? It does not give you an opportunity to discuss these issues. How is it different from before? 

00:32:45
[sil.] 

00:32:50
STACY I think just… We had less stress. I don't know. We were able to… We were able to talk about anything. Right? Anything. And now I feel like I can't really talk about anything with him. Umm… so it was… We had our arguments and things, but not like now. It's very… It's just separate. It's separated. I don't, I don't know if that makes sense. 

00:33:30
TWINET PARMER Yeah. It does, given all the other things that we've been talking about here in this session. 

00:33:35
[sil.] 

00:33:45
PHIL Yeah. Lot of times, we… we just, we don't talk. But before we used to, you know, stay up late and just have, you know, our long conversations. And when you have a three year old, you know, there is not a lot of time for that, kind of, stuff, you know. 

00:34:00
STACY We used to have fun. We used to have a lot of fun, a lot more fun. Laughing, goofing around. 

00:34:05
PHIL We used to do a lot of things together. 

00:34:10
TWINET PARMER And so let's try to umm… set some goals based on what we've been talking about here today. Uh, would you say… and you could help me do this, would you say one goal would be to communicate more about everything in this marriage? Or be able to talk, in a sense, about everything in this marriage? And we call that communication. 

00:34:45
STACY Yes, definitely. 

00:34:50
PHIL I know it… You know, with the way things have been, I mean, to even start, I mean, to set up like a time or… 

00:35:00
STACY The time? What you mean? 

00:35:00
PHIL Like just to have conversations or… 

00:35:05
TWINET PARMER Well, I think, we have to first establish what it is we need to work on here. And then, uh, we will do that, that the, kind of, thing you're talking about Phil, later on. But first, we have to figure out what's going on with you all. And what are some of the issues. What can we actually, uh, verbalize and say it's really the issues. When people talk about communication, as usually a red flag for some of other things because they are so many things that are included in communication. But once you stop talking or you're unable to talk about issues, then it becomes, uh, even more of a problem. Because the more you don't communicate, the more you try to communicate. And there is no, there is not a time when you cannot communicate. Saying nothing is still communication. And so if you're sweeping it under the rug, you're still communicating. Uh-huh, is that clear to you? 

00:36:15
STACY Yes. 

00:36:20
TWINET PARMER So again, let's try to umm… establish some specific goals. One might be to work on, to look at the things that are preventing you from talking and having the kind of relationship you once had. Would you say that would be one? Umm… And what might be another? 

00:36:45
[sil.] 

00:37:10
STACY I don't know. I just… Just go ahead. 

00:37:15
TWINET PARMER Could I help you, uh, with that, maybe? We could talk about how the two of you could be, get closer again, by being involved in some of the same things. You have not talked very much about things that were important to you. But we hear Phil talk about things that are very… Especially one thing that's very important to him, that he does daily and fairly often. Is there something that's important to you, that you would have to… I know you said it's important that he get's a job and that, kind of, thing. But is there something you would like to see happen, to indicate that could bring him in to your world, to be closer to you? 

00:38:05
STACY Well, I think basically what you just said. I would like him to… What's important to me is all of that. 

00:38:15
[sil.] 

00:38:20
STACY I want to be able… to share with him a stressful thing that happened at work or… I just miss the way we used to be. I don't, I don't know how else to say it. 

00:38:35
TWINET PARMER So it sounds like you want to work on being close. Okay. And you said something about being lonely. 

00:38:40
STACY Yeah. 

00:38:45
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. Uh, uh, umm… Phil, do you have that need to be close again? 

00:38:50
PHIL Yeah. I mean, with, with our relationship, we, we have, we've grown separate. We've, you know, we've… I think I said earlier, we're, kind of, feels like we're all doing this alone sometimes, you know. 

00:39:05
TWINET PARMER You mean alone, each of you, in your own world, in a sense. 

00:39:05
PHIL Right. Yeah. 

00:39:10
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. Okay, so it seems as though we have some vague idea about what we would like to talk about in terms of your communication, that's been a theme. And another one has been getting close. We've… would you agree with that? 

00:39:25
PHIL Yeah. 

00:39:25
STACY Yes. 

00:39:30
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. Umm… And then, what we can talk about more specifically is this closeness and this communication. So… But whenever I have a couple in, I usually like to ask them about, I know you've been talking about close, but a special kind of closeness. Uh, I know you did not come in for sex counseling or sex therapy. But whenever you have a couple, uh, if they're having conflict, it's likely that their sex is suffering. So let's talk about closeness in this relationship. There are a number of ways of looking at closeness. But… and it's called intimacy. But when we mention intimacy, so often people think we are talking about sex. Well, we are in a sense. But let's just talk about intimacy in this relationship around certain issues. For instance, what about the intimacy as it relates to work? You two do the same job, so I imagine that there's a certain amount of closeness there. I'm sorry. I don't mean you do the same job, but you work in the same type of profession. 

00:40:45
STACY Definitely. I mean, and it's just like, there has been, we've been able to share with each other some stresses. We relate. Uh, but like I said for me, just… Well, for a while now, I just haven't been able to… have an outlet for, for some of the stresses that I have. But we relate on that level, I mean, as far as the understanding and knowledge of, of it. Umm… what do you say? 

00:41:15
TWINET PARMER What about… Excuse me. 

00:41:15
STACY No, go on. No, I'm good. 

00:41:20
TWINET PARMER She wanted to know if you agreed with that. 

00:41:20
PHIL Yeah, I mean we… You know, we, you know, we have the same degree and we met at a conference, you know. And then we used to do the same thing. You know… 

00:41:30
STACY Yeah. 

00:41:35
TWINET PARMER So in terms of work, you all still have a certain amount of closeness, although you are currently unemployed. At one time, anyway, you were able to share that and be very close. What about things like your recreational intimacy? The things that you do for fun and so on. Play, that kind of thing. 

00:42:00
STACY There is, I don't think there's much there at all. At least now, currently, because Phil does a lot with his meetings and I'm usually too tired when I get home. Umm… I mean, we used to go to a movie now and then. 

00:42:20
PHIL It's kind of hard sometimes, with a three year old, you know, the one and only I own. 

00:42:25
TWINET PARMER And note, and the money, and so on. 

00:42:25
PHIL Right. 

00:42:30
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. Umm… What about social intimacy that is uh, interaction with people, and friends, and laughing, and, and so on, being involved with others. 

00:42:40
PHIL That's one thing we haven't done in a while. Been a long? 

00:42:45
STACY Long time. 

00:42:45
PHIL Yeah, we, before we had, you know, little Stacy, we, we used to do that stuff all the time, go out together and stuff. 

00:42:55
STACY We were on a dart team, even. 

00:42:55
PHIL Right. 

00:42:55
STACY We used to. 

00:43:00
PHIL And now it's, you know, we live for our child, you know. 

00:43:05
[sil.] 

00:43:10
TWINET PARMER And another type of intimacy is conflict intimacy. Umm… Conflict is a natural part of any relationship. And so when you have husband and wife, or any girlfriend, boyfriend, friend mates, all of that kind of thing. There's a natural, umm… there's a natural tendency to have conflict. So, uh, what about the, uh, conflict in this relationship? 

00:43:40
[sil.] 

00:43:45
STACY What would you say? 

00:43:45
PHIL Like the way we fight? 

00:43:50
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. 

00:43:50
PHIL You know, I… umm… You know, we go over the same thing over and over again. It's usually about me getting a job. Umm… you know, and I, you know, when I earned tend to avoid it sometimes. 

00:44:05
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. 

00:44:05
STACY And like, yeah, like conflict there, I mean, I definitely shut down after a while. I'm just tired of it and go in the other room. 

00:44:15
TWINET PARMER In case… Stacy, you said something about arguing earlier. But again, conflict is good in a relationship. It's just how it's handled. But if you've shut down, that may exacerbate the, the, the tension in the conflict when you start to interact. And then finally, well, not finally, because there are many other ways of looking at closeness and intimacy, there is the sexual intimacy. And that's what people usually think about when they talk about intimacy. Stacy, I'm noticing that you… I think, you had some type of reaction to that. 

00:45:00
STACY Yeah, that's pretty much non-existent or it has been for some months now. Umm… But I… I mean, I agree with everything you said and I think that is a part of being close. And that's not there either. There's just no… I don't know how to say it. No drive for it, may be. Umm… 

00:45:25
TWINET PARMER On your part. 

00:45:30
STACY That and I don't even know Phil's attracted to me. I don't even know. 

00:45:35
[sil.] 

00:45:40
TWINET PARMER And uh, Phil, what about you, in terms of sexual intimacy? 

00:45:50
PHIL Yeah. Me, it's been months, I think. Umm… we used to have a pretty, pretty good sex life, I guess, you know. Everything was good in that area and then. Umm… yeah, it's been a few months. 

00:46:05
STACY Yeah. 

00:46:05
TWINET PARMER Is that something we could add to our list of all the things that we're working on? 

00:46:15
STACY I would very much like to. 

00:46:15
TWINET PARMER You would like to do that? 

00:46:15
STACY Yeah. 

00:46:15
TWINET PARMER So we could talk about that. 

00:46:20
STACY I miss, I miss that. So yeah. 

00:46:25
TWINET PARMER A lot of times, if we are not communicating, we don't feel close in a number of ways. And then the sex goes because of that closeness, is, is now missing. And if we have a lot of conflict, people don't always want to engage or a lot of issues. Well, it's… It's about time for us to wrap up today. Umm… I'm happy that you came in and I'm willing to work with you all, around these issues that we talked, talked about today, and others that might come up. Umm… Do you have any questions? 

00:47:05
PHIL Umm… I don't. 

00:47:10
STACY No, I don't. No. 

00:47:15
TWINET PARMER Well, in our next session, uh, we can start looking at these things, these issues. And I'm willing to help you work on these issues. But, uh, this is a team effort. And the three of us would have to work together. Uh, so we were talking about communication, closeness, intimacy and then, uh, the fact that you have not had sex in months. Umm… Let me ask you this in terms of the sex. Was there ever a problem with issues around the sex in the past? 

00:47:50
PHIL Umm… No. 

00:47:55
STACY No. 

00:47:55
TWINET PARMER Okay. Okay. And so it's situational, related to this particular issue, these issues that you're now experiencing. Uh-huh. Well, umm… I hope you can… There's something you could take away with you today and think about. And when we meet again, we can, uh, begin and start discussing these things. Thank you so much for being open today and, uh, we'll see you next time. 

00:48:25
STACY Thank you. 

00:48:25
PHIL Thank you. 

00:48:30
Pause for Discussion 

00:48:35
TWINET PARMER Umm… Hello, uh, Phil and Stacy. How are you all today? 

00:48:40
STACY Okay. 

00:48:45
PHIL Umm… Yeah, I would say okay. Umm… we, uh, we tried to talk about some of the issues that we talked about in our last session when we're at home, between sessions. And we, kind of, got into a bit of an argument. 

00:49:00
STACY Just a bit. 

00:49:05
PHIL Yeah. Umm… You know, we, we just kept going in circles and circles, we, we really didn't get anywhere. 

00:49:10
STACY Well, and I wonder why that happens. 

00:49:15
PHIL You know, one of the things I, I was bringing up… 

00:49:15
STACY He just ignores me. 

00:49:20
PHIL …is she keeps cutting me off. You know, she's doing it right now. 

00:49:25
STACY Well, because you don't give me anything. You're quiet and just nothing. 

00:49:30
PHIL Well, what do you want? 

00:49:30
STACY You to talk, give me a response, a facial expression might help. He's just plain, doesn't do anything. 

00:49:45
PHIL You know, and our, our arguments are going like this just around and around. Then we're like, you know, it's like we talked about last time. We were not going anywhere. 

00:49:50
TWINET PARMER So this is the way it happens at home. You feel that she interrupts you. How do you feel about that? 

00:50:00
STACY How do I feel about the fact that he feels I interrupt him? 

00:50:00
TWINET PARMER He feels you… 

00:50:05
[sil.] 

00:50:10
STACY Uh, I don't really feel that much about it. I mean, I interrupt because he turns to just… uh, talk about nothing. I don't get anything. I don't get any thing from him. Just little bits and pieces and then he's quiet. You know, I get upset. And I get frustrated. And I get, he's just doesn't respond. 

00:50:30
TWINET PARMER Well, these are the issues that you brought in as presenting problems. You talked about your marital discord or marital conflict. You also talked about your, uh, lack of closeness, and how you communicate. And then there was also an issue about the lack of sex in your relationship. I believe you said that it's been three months since you've had sex. Umm… Phil, I… umm… both of you, I'm wondering about how… what I saw. in especially you, Stacy, in the last session. And the way umm… you presented your issues, that just didn't seem indicative of what I know about you and the way you had act in previous sessions. Do you, uh, want to comment on that, Phil? 

00:51:40
PHIL Yeah umm… you know, that was part of one of, one of our conversations after last session is, umm… you know, her cutting me off is, kind of, what I'm used to anymore at home. I mean, we… Every time I try to say something, I get cut off. And I get, and I get that and I get, you know, why aren't you looking for a job? That's always, kind of, the trump card. She is always throwing it out. You know, she just, uh, she just trumps it all the time. 

00:52:05
TWINET PARMER But she was very low keyed the last time. And so, Stacy, I was wondering, what was… What were you thinking? Or what might have been going on with you? 

00:52:20
STACY I, kind of, was, uh, was really tired. I'm just, I'm tired of it. I'm tired of… And I just was tired of fighting. Last, you know, and, and today I'm really frustrated. You know, last time, we met, I think, I was just, kind of, and I don't give up mode, I'll just go along with everything and nod and I agree with you and Phil and… That's not really how I feel. Umm… This, this past week I has just been really frustrating. And he needs to get a job. 

00:53:00
TWINET PARMER Stacy is saying it was frustrating for her, her. How was it for you, Phil? 

00:53:05
PHIL Well, I mean, for our conversation? Our conversation… 

00:53:10
TWINET PARMER She was speaking about the week. 

00:53:10
PHIL Yeah. Well, you know, that argument, kind of, lasted most of the week. You know, it's just little things over time, where, you know, every time we have a conversation and it always seem to go down that road and nothing ever gets resolved for us. We, we just argue about the same thing. 

00:53:25
STACY Yeah, and he acts like he doesn't care. Like this isn't important. 

00:53:30
TWINET PARMER Let's do one thing. Can you all, sort of, direct your comments to one another, when we are talking? There, there are a number of ways that we communicate. We have five senses. And we communicate even using each of those. And so we have to listen. Uh, we have to respond, we have to feel, touch those kinds of things. We have to hear. But if we each are talking at the same time, I always say we can all sing together, but we can't talk together. And so, can we wait until the other person is finished? Everyone will have an opportunity to talk. And, uh, then try responding to what the person just said, respond to that. I know there is the, the temptation to always say, I, I, I rather than responding to what the other individual said. And that really keeps the dialogue going. And it supports what the other person just said. And so if you could just look at one another and, sort of, talk to one another, and then wait for each, the other person to finish speaking is… Now those are some of the first rules of communication. Is that something you feel you would like to do? 

00:55:05
STACY Sure. I'll give it a try. 

00:55:05
TWINET PARMER Okay. Can you tell me, Stacy, what you all were trying to talk about, over the week? Although since we last met. 

00:55:20
STACY Money. He's looking for a job. I feel neglected because he's with his native culture, deals, going on, all that stuff, all the time. He just runs off to that. And I can't even… It's just, it is, it's a circle, like he said. 

00:55:45
PHIL Over the week, yes, I mean, umm… I am busy and, you know, you know, with the kids… 

00:55:55
STACY But, you're busy, you're busy, but you're busy doing the, your native stuff, when you should be focused on money, and on us, and on Stacy. 

00:56:05
PHIL I thought we weren't gonna cut each other off. 

00:56:10
STACY Oh… See how he says that. "I thought we weren't gonna cut each other off." That just irritates me. 

00:56:20
PHIL Well, you know, we, we start talking about an issue and then, you know, every time I try to say something you just go right over top. 

00:56:30
STACY Well, maybe you should try to be a little bit more stronger, get a backbone. 

00:56:35
TWINET PARMER Can you tell him what that means? 

00:56:40
STACY I feel when we talk that you argue that I'm arguing with a wall. You don't, you don't… It's like I'm at this level and you're at this level. And if you're really frustrated you're not, first of all, I don't know where it's going. Except for when you leave, you know, maybe you get it out that way. I don't know. But it's, I feel like I'm talking to a kid. You just sit there. 

00:57:10
PHIL Well, I think part of is, you, I think, you like talking to me like a kid, you know. When you talk to me, it's always, you know, you like, you need to do this, you need to get a job, you need to take care of this. It's never, you know, we're never working as a team anymore. 

00:57:30
STACY Right, 'cause I'm doing everything. I'm taking… I'm bringing home the money. I'm taking care of our daughter, especially in the evenings after I've worked all day. I'm responsible for everything it feels like. And you just go lollygagging off with, you know, doing the native culture, everything with that. 

00:57:50
PHIL Well, that's what I'd like to incorporate, or incorporate you in with me. 

00:57:55
STACY When do I have time? 

00:57:55
PHIL Well, you know, sometimes we have to make time. And you know, I try to make time for you and it feels like you really just don't care about… 

00:58:00
STACY When have you tried to make time for me? 

00:58:05
PHIL You see what I mean. 

00:58:05
TWINET PARMER Stacy, it sounds as though you're saying I'm a little tired of carrying the burden. 

00:58:15
STACY Mm-hmm. That's it. 

00:58:15
TWINET PARMER And I recall in another session, you said, that was the same pattern that occurred when you were growing up, in terms of carrying the burden… 

00:58:25
STACY Oh, definitely. 

00:58:25
TWINET PARMER …is one that you see in your marriage. 

00:58:30
STACY Definitely. And yeah, and now my marriage is, it's… I feel like I'm back in that place again. Being the, you know, the one running the show or expected to run the show. And do it well, and perfect, and no help. 

00:58:40
TWINET PARMER What can you… uh, How can you help Phil understand or empathize with you, in terms of what you are saying about carrying the burden? 

00:58:55
STACY I don't, I don't know. Umm… Switch for a day. I, I don't know. 

00:59:05
PHIL He may not understand. And, Phil, you might want to address this. He may not understand the depth of what you are saying. Do you understand what she's trying to say to you, Phil? 

00:59:20
PHIL Sometimes. You know, sometimes I like to think I understand, but sometimes I really don't, like, you know. I just feel like I'm getting yelled at, you know, like a kid. You know. You know, we, we try to talk things through and it becomes more of me getting yelled at. You know, that's how I feel. 

00:59:40
TWINET PARMER So that's that communication again. It sounds like you all need to practice some skills, and listening, and understanding. So what do you want him to understand about the way you are feeling? 

00:59:55
STACY I want you to understand that I feel… I feel alone. I'm lonely. I'm overwhelmed. I feel like I'm doing everything myself. 

01:00:15
[sil.] 

01:00:20
PHIL You know that's not… 

01:00:20
TWINET PARMER Just a moment, Phil. Let's see if she's finished. 

01:00:25
[sil.] 

01:00:30
STACY I just feel like I'm not married. 

01:00:35
[sil.] 

01:00:40
STACY And that… that really is not… It's not what I want. I don't want to feel that way. 

01:00:50
TWINET PARMER Phil, what do you hear her saying? 

01:00:55
PHIL I hear her saying that she feels like she's got a lot of responsibility and she's taking care of the whole family. Sounds like she's got, kind of, the weight of the world on her shoulders. 

01:01:05
STACY Yeah. 

01:01:10
TWINET PARMER How does that make you feel to hear your wife? Express that, whether you agree with it or not. 

01:01:15
PHIL Oh, it makes me want to help her. I mean, makes me want to, you know, do what I can to make this a team, you know. Umm… but I got to know what you want. What do you need from me? 

01:01:35
STACY I just need you to be there, okay? I just feel like you are… I feel like you are not there, emotionally, physically, intellectually, even. There's no support. I feel nothing. I don't feel anything from you. 

01:01:55
[sil.] 

01:02:00
TWINET PARMER Maybe you could help him, and maybe you could tell him what you would like for him to do to help you feel. 

01:02:10
STACY This is hard. 

01:02:15
[sil.] 

01:02:20
TWINET PARMER I would like, I would like some attention. I would like to know that I mean something to you, that I'm important to you. I feel like I'm ignored. I just feel like, I want to be a part of a marriage, our marriage. 

01:02:55
[sil.] 

01:03:00
TWINET PARMER You are so… You don't give me anything. I feel… I just feel like I don't get anything, any support. 

01:03:10
TWINET PARMER Phil, how do you feel hearing your wife say that? 

01:03:15
PHIL It, you know, it makes me… maybe see some of the pain that she's, you know, she's got right now with, umm… you know, in this relationship, too. I mean, we're both hurting and, you know, I think we both, kind of, feel alone. It's like we're, kind of, going down two separate paths and we're by ourselves and umm… I also heard her say that she, she wants to be a part of our team again, like, like we used to be. 

01:03:45
STACY I do. Yeah, I do. 

01:03:50
PHIL She needs more attention from me. 

01:03:55
TWINET PARMER And it sounds like it maybe that you need to, you each need to communicate what you need. And it seems as though, in this particular situation, since you are the breadwinner mainly and all those other things you mentioned, you might need to really help Phil understand, what it is you need. And Phil might have some needs. What might be your needs, Phil? 

01:04:30
PHIL Well, I need to be heard. You know, sometimes, you know, I'm locked up with little Stacy and, you know, I'm, you know, I'm not as busy as you and you her bring and you are supporting us, you know, but, umm… I'm taking care of our child and I'm busy all day long with our child and then, you know, I'm trying to learn some stuff about myself and where I come from and you know, that's the, kind of, bring you with me and I feel like you, I feel alone, 'cause you, you don't maybe make time for me, you know. Sometimes I'm, you know, that's when I feel alone and I don't feel heard and, you know, when we try to have these conversations and you just, kind of, steamroll me and I, you know, you know, I really feel emasculated, you know, you just, you take everything. You know, you don't, you don't leave me anything. 

01:05:25
TWINET PARMER So it sounds like you are saying you feel beaten down and so you distance yourself. And you are saying it sounds as though you are saying, the more he distances himself from me, the more I come at him. And the more angry or frustrated I get and it sounds like Phil shuts down. Is that accurate? 

01:05:50
STACY I think it is. 

01:05:50
TWINET PARMER Phil, is that an accurate assessment? 

01:05:50
PHIL Yeah. 

01:05:55
[sil.] 

01:06:00
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. So, Stacy, what, given what Phil said about the way he feels he's treated, what do you hear him saying that you could do to correct some of that? 

01:06:20
STACY Uh, I heard him say "Steamroll," and "not being heard". 

01:06:30
[sil.] 

01:06:35
STACY I guess, I need, I guess I took control getting really angry and yelling. I need to probably back down from that. It's hard though. It's really hard to do that. It's frustrating still. Because he does close, shut down and I tend to be the one that… like this and it, there's no… 

01:07:05
TWINET PARMER But what can you do in response to what he said? Recall he said, "I shutdown because she comes at me and emasculates me." 

01:07:20
[sil.] 

01:07:25
STACY I need to be more gentle, listen, not talk down to you. 

01:07:35
[sil.] 

01:07:40
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. Phil, what are you hearing her say that she needs to be and do? 

01:07:50
PHIL To make me feel better. You know, she's, she's stating all those things that, you know, I, I really need, you know. You know, I need to be heard and I need to able to get it out without being, you know, again steamroll, you know, and umm… kind of that same respect I give her, you know, with our conversations and, you know, I, I need that and it sounds like she's, you know… 

01:08:15
TWINET PARMER It's interesting. You said the, the same kind of respect you give her. Would you agree with that? That he respects you in communication? 

01:08:30
STACY Uh, no. In fact, when you said that I… kind of, threw me. Umm… because he shuts down, I don't feel respected either, like he's not able to tell me what he feels really, really get it out. 

01:08:50
[sil.] 

01:08:55
PHIL Oh, you know, when I get yelled at, I just shut down and that's I mean… 

01:09:00
STACY I don't yell all the time. 

01:09:00
TWINET PARMER Okay, let's not go back to that. We are trying to move forward. I think we understand that. 

01:09:05
STACY Okay. 

01:09:10
TWINET PARMER But Stacy is telling you some things that she needs to be heard, okay? What do you hear her saying? 

01:09:20
PHIL That she, you know, she wants, well, first of all, she said that I'm not listening to her and I shut down and she feels like she's not being heard. And, you know, obviously, I need to make an effort to be there and participate in those conversations and not shut down. 

01:09:45
STACY Mm-hmm. 

01:09:50
[sil.] 

01:09:55
TWINET PARMER So, uh, Stacy, you are saying if you felt heard then maybe you would not have to yell or, or if Phil does not shut down on you, maybe you would feel more connected to him. 

01:10:10
STACY Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. 

01:10:15
TWINET PARMER Phil, do you understand the source of her yelling and how she's feeling and she said she's had all the, all of these years, she's always had pressure in her family. She was expected to carry the burden, umm… and now in her marriage, she's doing the same thing. 

01:10:40
PHIL Yeah, I mean, she's, there a lot of weight on her right now, especially financially. I mean, she's supporting the whole family and, you know, umm… obviously, I need to do as much as I possibly can do help out and make it a team effort, you know. So we can get back to that team, maybe. Make sure that she's being heard as well as me, you know what I mean. 

01:11:05
TWINET PARMER I think I hear you saying you are willing to move closer to Stacy and what was preventing you from not being close to Stacy in the past was the fact that you could not communicate with her because she was angry, she was frustrated and she yelled. And as a result, uh, you backed off and you shut down. 

01:11:30
PHIL Yeah. 

01:11:35
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. Is that clear to you, Stacy? 

01:11:40
STACY Mm-hmm. 

01:11:45
TWINET PARMER Now, Phil, what do you need to feel heard in this relationship, as it relates to how you all communicate? 

01:11:55
PHIL Umm… I'm, kind of, back to the, you know, just the having those conversations and just having them. Umm… that don't escalate and you know, keep ratcheting up, you know, and umm… just be able to voice everything I need to voice and have her hear me and then, you know. You know, you know, I don't mind having comments come back or, umm… but I need to be heard first before I get, you know, an opinion there, you know, thoughts on it. 

01:12:25
TWINET PARMER You said she emasculates you. Can you say more about that? 

01:12:30
PHIL Well, you know, with financially, you know, you know, we, she's our breadwinner. She makes all the money in the family right now and umm… she controls that whole thing and you know, as a man, I mean, typically we are the breadwinners, we're, you know, out there, supporting our families. Umm… and it seems to be a constant issue where umm… that, kind of, gets thrown at my face. You know, like I'm not doing my part to help out our family, umm… to, like I'm not trying and, you know… 

01:13:10
TWINET PARMER I've heard you say, umm… consistently, "I keep our child, I keep our child." And does it seem as though that something that has no value, no value has been placed on that by Stacy. 

01:13:30
PHIL I don't think that she doesn't value our child. I think that… 

01:13:30
TWINET PARMER The value the fact that you keep the child? 

01:13:35
PHIL Yeah. I think that, yeah. I think that sometimes she, umm… you know, it's been a while since she's been at home, you know and stayed home and umm… I feel like I'm not appreciated umm… for some of the stuff I do around the house, you know. Umm… Little Stacy is on… constantly on the move, you know. It's a busy day and I know she's busy too, so… 

01:14:00
TWINET PARMER I think in terms of money, Stacy, do you realize how much money that saves you? I know it's important for Phil to have a job, but sometimes to have a loving person you can trust your child with, may have some value. Phil, could you comment on that? Am I incorrect in that assumption? 

01:14:25
STACY No, I think that's right on, you know. I think I'm very fortunate one… You know, we are very fortunate that umm… I am able to at least spend some time our daughter, you know. Because, you know, who knows, you know, she could be in just one of those daycares. I'm at currently right now, you know, one of us is always there, always with our child, so that's never in question. 

01:14:55
TWINET PARMER Stacy, could you tell him how much you value that? 

01:15:00
STACY I am… I really do value. I do value that you are with her. Umm… and you are right. You know, it's better than her being with strangers all day and it does save money, I know that. 

01:15:25
[sil.] 

01:15:30
STACY Umm… It would be nice if we could work with her together some times. I do evening things with her and you do during the whole day, but we rarely parent her together. 

01:15:50
TWINET PARMER So again, it sounds like you are saying, "I want the three of us to be together. I want to be close to you." 

01:15:55
STACY Yeah. 

01:16:00
TWINET PARMER And you are saying you want to be close to Stacy. Now can you tell Stacy specifically, I'll ask Stacy to respond to this, can you tell her specifically in addition to what you've just said about the babysitting, how you would like for her to interact with you? 

01:16:20
PHIL Umm… I think that, you know, your idea of us interacting as a family would be a good thing, you know. Umm… kind of, like we talked about in our last session where we were talking about just, you know, shift change, you know. I took the morning, you took the afternoon and umm… I think we do need to umm… work on being there together, you know, and showing us as a team for our child. And I need to make a better, umm… effort on that as well. 

01:17:00
TWINET PARMER There was also another issue. You continue to talk about your, let's say, new found culture. The fact that you've been doing, you once did some work fairly recently with, uh, Native Americans and you have grown to embrace your culture and, uh, I know at one point, you said that Stacy's culture was because she's just White American, it wasn't as important to you, to her as yours is to you and I think, is that accurate, Stacy? 

01:17:40
STACY Mm-hmm. 

01:17:40
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. And, and maybe it's even something you resent because he's push you away to be with what you called his people. Is that an accurate assessment of that? 

01:17:55
STACY Mm-hmm. I, yeah, I've said the word. I believe I said "neglect." Or resent. Yeah, I resent that. I feel neglected. 

01:18:05
TWINET PARMER Phil, that seems to be a major issue that affects your communication and blocks your closeness. How can, what would you like to see Stacy do to be more involved in to embrace your culture? Maybe not to the same extent as you embrace it, but to at least show some interest. Can you talk to her? 

01:18:30
PHIL Maybe even just doing like one or two community events, like once in a while. And maybe we could do it as a family, you know, me, you and little Stacy. You know, we could, you know, work together as a team. And you know, that would, you know, bring you in and we could be closer as a family, I think, together, you know. Yours truly, know, we need to spend more time together, you know. 

01:19:05
STACY Yeah. 

01:19:10
TWINET PARMER Another issue was the job. How can you communicate to Stacy and maybe, Stacy, if he were to give you an update each day of what he was doing, in terms of looking for a job, because it doesn't sound as though that something you talk about, you two. Maybe you come in and he goes out the door. Uh-huh. Tell him how you would like to be involved in his job hunting experience? 

01:19:40
STACY Well, I think, umm… like, like she had mentioned, uh, keeping me in the know at least what, what you are looking out, what you found, where you're applying. Talk about it with me, what do you think? You know, I mean, I'd be interested to know what you are looking at, I mean, we have the same background. I think that'd be, I don't know, I really like that idea. 

01:20:15
PHIL So keeping you more informed of what I'm doing during the day and where I send out apps or if I have any interviews or anything like that. 

01:20:25
STACY Yeah. 

01:20:25
PHIL I can do that. 

01:20:30
TWINET PARMER What were your other issues that you could not communicate about that seemed to, uh, prevent you from being close? I know we are going to talk about the sex issue, but what else might you able to do or is that is a concern maybe you have not raised… 

01:20:55
[sil.] 

01:21:10
PHIL Yeah, I think the closeness, umm… kind of, coming together as a team, umm… our communication still, you know, sounds like we have some ideas, but we still need to communicate well, 'cause, you know, we were at home last, after last session and we, kind of, fell back into the same stuff and we just argued, so… 

01:21:40
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. So what do you know at this point, Phil, about how to communicate, based on what we've talked about today? 

01:21:45
PHIL Well, we, you know, we need to hear each other out. We need to, umm… be there. Umm… not get defensive, not umm… pull out of the situation, but umm… listen to the other person and acknowledge what they are saying so that each person would be heard. Umm… that's, that's probably the biggest thing that I'm getting. 

01:22:15
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. Then what did you hear your wife say about what she needs from you? 

01:22:20
PHIL She needs more attention. She needs, uh, she needs me to spend more time with her and umm… be a team. She, you know, she wants to, to be able to parent our child as a team, not as individuals, 'cause, you know, I've been taking the morning shift and she's been taking the afternoon and sounds like we need to do more stuff as a family. 

01:22:45
STACY Mm-hmm. 

01:22:50
TWINET PARMER Stacy, what did you hear Phil say that he needed from you? 

01:22:55
STACY Umm… what I heard him say is, umm… he doesn't like me to bulldoze or steamroll over him. He would like me to… not talk to him like a child. Umm… really listen, he wants to be heard. He does want to be close. 

01:23:25
[sil.] 

01:23:30
STACY Would like me to be involved in some cultural events. 

01:23:35
[sil.] 

01:23:40
STACY That's all I can think of. 

01:23:40
TWINET PARMER Now in terms of being close, there are number of ways of being close or being intimate. You came in saying that you had not been sexually intimate or sexually close in three months. We talked about various levels of intimacy. And sex is only, is probably the ultimate, because we talked about career intimacy and you said that because you do the same type of work, you are very close in that regard, but when it came to social things, uh, recreational kinds of intimacy, closeness that is, umm… and some other areas. Emotionally, you did not feel close and that's one type of intimacy and so, my question to you is, how does that impact the, the fact that you have not had sex in three months. Stacy, could you say something about that? 

01:24:55
STACY Well, because I get so angry, the last thing I want to do, and frustrated with him, is be sexual. I just, it's not that I don't, it's not that I'm not attracted to him. It's… It's really hard to explain. It's umm… it's like, I just… the desire, I guess at the time isn't here because it's more and more worked up with my irritation and… 

01:25:30
TWINET PARMER Not feeling close? 

01:25:35
STACY And that lack of closeness, yes. 

01:25:35
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. And all those other things, the day-to-day living will impact your desire to be close to Phil. 

01:25:45
STACY Yeah. 

01:25:50
TWINET PARMER And this is recent in the last year. 

01:25:50
STACY Mm-hmm. 

01:25:50
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. 

01:25:50
STACY Mm-hmm. 

01:25:55
TWINET PARMER And you both said prior to, let's say, three months or when everything, is got so bad that you were not communicating and had gone apart. Sex was not an issue? Umm… Phil, how does, uh, the things that you two have been experiencing impact sex for you? 

01:26:20
PHIL Umm… Well, you know, I, you know, I try to engage in, you know, in the, you know, after the child is, you know, stays as little Stacy has been put to sleep and counseling is shut down, you know. I remember when we, you know, even a year ago, it was, we had a good, you know, sex life and everything was going good and tried to, you know, we kindled that, you know. And I get a brick wall, you know. 

01:26:55
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. 

01:27:00
[sil.] 

01:27:10
STACY Well, I guess the response to that, I feel, and I have felt for a long time when you do want to engage, umm… because there is no closeness anywhere else. I feel like it's just a sex act. It's just about that's all we have going. Well, there's all, you know, it's like I want to be more than a receptacle, and that's, kind of, how I feel. Without all those are the things we talked about, without those things being in place, sex to me, is just, it doesn't feel right. 

01:27:55
TWINET PARMER And another thing I recall you saying that he gropes you, it's almost like tapping you on the shoulder at night in the bed. 

01:28:00
STACY Mm-hmm, 

01:28:05
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. Can you say more about that? 

01:28:05
STACY Oh, I'll be laying there and the hand comes around, he gets close behind me and umm… I just well, I just… I shut down. Honestly, I do. I just don't… Again, I feel like that's his way of trying to be close, is to… you know, let's… let's have sex and that's it. 

01:28:35
TWINET PARMER Phil, how does the fact that you haven't been close and haven't been communicating affects the sex for you? 

01:28:45
PHIL Well, I'm hearing Stacy saying that, you know, I, you know, I am the first one to, you know, tap on the shoulder, umm… turn in, engage in and she, you know, I feel shut down, you know, she just, kind of, ends it, you know whether I'm tired or a little headache or umm… you know. Maybe tomorrow, you know, or it would, you know, we, it's very important to me and, you know, I guess, it, kind of, adds that feeling of being alone. 

01:29:25
STACY Mm-hmm. It's important to me, too. 

01:29:30
[sil.] 

01:29:35
TWINET PARMER What do you think needs to done to, in order to, uh, move you all back together in that way? 

01:29:45
PHIL Well, it sounds like we need to work on our communication to, you know, kind of the whole thing, to, kind of, get things going, I guess. Umm… me tapping on her shoulders isn't working. You know, we work on the communication, we can build that closeness again, kind of, like we used to be. 

01:30:15
[sil.] 

01:30:20
TWINET PARMER Stacy, what do you need to have to be, uh, sexual again in this relationship? 

01:30:30
STACY I'd like to feel wanted and rather than "Knock-knock, is anyone home?" 

01:30:40
[sil.] 

01:30:45
STACY How… I want to feel sexual, I want to feel like you want me and I will respond to that. I mean, I would really feel like I would, that's what I would really like. 

01:30:55
TWINET PARMER But he is. He is attempting to want you sexually, but it sounds like you are saying these other places are not, other things are not in place, so I don't feel connected to you, I don't feel close to you because "knock-knock" is not the way you can connect to me and get us back on track. 

01:31:20
STACY Right. 

01:31:25
TWINET PARMER Let me just share this with you. There used to be a book called "Sex Begins in the Kitchen," and it simply means… Well, let me ask you, what do you think that means, Stacy? 

01:31:35
STACY I think it's funny. Umm… that's good. Sex begins in the kitchen, well, umm… I would say something along lines of something together like cooking or… 

01:31:50
[sil.] 

01:31:55
STACY That intimacy is, is there before the actual act. I don't know, something like that. 

01:32:00
TWINET PARMER Phil, what would you say, sex begins in the kitchen means? 

01:32:10
PHIL Well, you talked about that different levels of intimacy before and it, kind of, sounds like maybe if you work on some different levels, you know, the sex will come back and I mean it, kind of, I guess, preheat the oven, I guess. 

01:32:25
TWINET PARMER Oh, great. Great analogy there. 

01:32:30
STACY We just laughed. We haven't done that in a while. That was funny. 

01:32:35
TWINET PARMER Well, maybe you need to talk about preheating the oven, and heating the oven, time the temperature up. Uh-huh. So, umm… well, how might, based on what she said, how might you preheat the oven? 

01:32:50
PHIL Well, it's I think it's one of those things where they come as some of the stuff we've been talking about with umm… working on our communication, doing some things together, umm… whether it'd be doing some functions with her and some things she'd like to do as a family, you know, umm… and then may be come in doing some of the cultural stuff with me, so that we're, umm… we're getting closer, we're on the same track again. 

01:33:15
TWINET PARMER What about you, Stacy? 

01:33:20
STACY What does "preheat the oven" mean? 

01:33:20
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh, yes. 

01:33:25
[sil.] 

01:33:30
STACY Umm… Well, kind of, along lines of what he said, but I would also include in there, umm… add a little spice as we preheat? Try something, maybe different, something different, I don't know. I pretty much agree with what he said. 

01:33:50
[sil.] 

01:33:55
STACY Umm… really long foreplay, I'd like that. 

01:34:00
TWINET PARMER But the important thing is that we have to know and learn that it begins long before we are in the bed, that's what "Sex Begins in the Kitchen" means. if, ]If you are unhappy throughout the day, if she doesn't feel supported or you don't feel that she desires you or she's willing to respond to your tap on the shoulder, then umm… sex has not begun in the kitchen. 

01:34:35
[sil.] 

01:34:40
PHIL So setting it up, kind of, all day and really, you know, working at it, you know, over a period of time, you know. 

01:34:50
TWINET PARMER Because like any relationship, you have to work on it and, uh, you all have a good opportunity at this point because it's been three months, to go back to that period, recreate the period when you first met or the honeymoon period again. You have an opportunity to do that at this point, but it sounds as though some things need to change and rebuild some relationships here between the two of you. 

01:35:35
STACY Mm-hmm. 

01:35:40
TWINET PARMER One thing before we close for today, I wanted to go back to this. Umm… Stacy, you said something about, you have always had to be the strong one and be the model child, I think, because she were the oldest child in your family. Do you think, I know Phil had somewhat of a different upbringing, umm… do you think he understands what you mean by that? 

01:36:15
STACY I'm not sure. 

01:36:15
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. Would you like to ask him? 

01:36:20
STACY Yeah. Do you, do you understand what that means? 

01:36:25
PHIL I understand what you said about us and how you feel like you, kind of, have the weight word the world on you, you know. But no, I don't think we really talked about some of the umm… stuff from here, you know, from growing up as a child. 

01:36:45
TWINET PARMER That would help you understand what she means by… she sees this, those things in her marriage now that she experienced growing up in her family. It seems as though you came from, I recall you saying, you came from a very tight knit family where people were sort of relaxed in what they did. Stacy came from a family was rigid and had very religious and had more drama because they were trying to live by their religious doctrine and so on, and you always had to be the good child. 

01:37:25
STACY Mm-hmm. 

01:37:30
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. And carry the burden. 

01:37:30
STACY Mm-hmm. I never really had a childhood, actually. 

01:37:35
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm… Mm-hmm… And that may even be more crucial in this marital conflict because it's almost like, "Here we go again." 

01:37:50
STACY Mm-hmm. 

01:37:55
TWINET PARMER Phil, given what we've talked about today, what, kind of, pledge would you like to make to Stacy, about attempting to do the communication, getting close again? What would you like to say to her? I'm calling it a pledge, but how would you like to commit to her today that you would work to try to… or be better or make this relationship better? 

01:38:25
PHIL Well, I would, I would commit to umm… 

01:38:30
TWINET PARMER Is there, excuse me, is there some way you could connect with her now? 

01:38:40
PHIL Umm… I think making sure that she's being heard. 

01:38:40
TWINET PARMER I mean at this moment. 

01:38:40
PHIL Umm… 

01:38:45
[sil.] 

01:38:50
TWINET PARMER Physically, is there some way you can connect with her right now? 

01:38:50
PHIL I could hold her hand, is that…yeah? Umm… I would commit to umm… making sure that you are feeling heard umm… and doing my part to make sure that you feel like we're a team again umm… as well as family and making sure that I incorporate you into my life umm… as well as our daughter, so that we can, we can work together as a team and not as individuals, so we don't feel alone. 

01:39:30
TWINET PARMER Specifically, tell her maybe two things you are willing to do. 

01:39:35
PHIL Umm… understand our conversations and not zone out or, umm… you know, kind of, lock up, maybe and make time for you. 

01:39:55
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. Could you maybe put your other hand on top of there, you too. And Stacy, put your other hand up, yes. And Stacy, could you commit to something that you are willing to do? To start communicating more effectively and moving back, such that moving towards being close? 

01:40:20
STACY Okay. Umm… Yes, I would like to listen to you and not steamroll over you, let you have your say. And I would also really actually like to do something fun, do something, umm… an event or something with your, with your native culture, with Stacy, like you said, the team thing. 

01:40:50
TWINET PARMER So it sounds like you are committed to do some things with him, specifically, you know how important his culture is at this point, you would like to be involved and that and what else, specifically? 

01:41:05
STACY I will not yell at you. I will not yell, I will not, I will try and I will work on not yelling at you and getting so frustrated, so quickly. 

01:41:20
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. Okay, so sounds like we have our homework. And I'm going to add to the homework, in addition to the things that you've committed to today. You gonna try to work on them. And if you slide back or relapse, you don't have to hate yourself because you did, but the fact that you are now understanding, the impasse between the two of you, you are able to work on those things. But I'd like for you to sit for 30 minutes, no TV or anything like that and engage in conversation, where you practice communication skills that is attending, by looking at one another, nodding to show that you are with them. You are going to listen. You are going to speak when it's time for you to speak. You can go on and control that tone and you may even touch. No groping, Phil. No groping. Uh-huh. It's not a time to grope. So what senses did we cover? Sight, because you'd be looking. Ears, hear, speech. See. There's another… 

01:42:55
STACY Touch. 

01:42:55
TWINET PARMER Touch. 

01:42:55
STACY No groping, but touch. 

01:43:00
TWINET PARMER No groping, but touch. No groping, Phil. Stick your hand out. Pam-pam-pam-pam(ph). No groping, okay? So you have two homework assignments, one you're doing individually and one you're doing together. But those things you each promised to do, you may need help from the other person to remind you or Stacy, if he appears to be shutting down, you are not gonna be the attack dog. And if she appears to be yelling, you have to find the appropriate words and say, "Now, Honey. Okay, I'm listening." or something, so we are responsible, as a system, we are responsible for one another but individually, we also have our responsibility. Can you just tell me, umm… Stacy, uh, something that you will take away from today's session? 

01:44:10
[sil.] 

01:44:15
STACY Until today, I really didn't realize how much it really hurt, it's hurt umm… this lack of closeness. So taking away would be umm… hope, that, that there is still connection here, we just need to work on it. 

01:44:40
TWINET PARMER What about you, Phil? 

01:44:45
PHIL Umm… I, uh, was able to learn that my wife here has, umm… she's got a lot of responsibility on her shoulders right now and she needs to be heard and I need to be present for a conversation and she needs them, so. 

01:45:00
TWINET PARMER Okay. Very good. Umm… I think you did some good work to get… today and I appreciate you sharing as usual, umm… continue to work. Do your homework and we will see you next session, and thank you for coming in. 

01:45:25
PHIL Thank you. 

01:45:25
STACY Thank you. 

01:45:25
TWINET PARMER Okay, okay. 

01:45:30
Pause for Discussion 

01:45:35
TWINET PARMER Good afternoon. Stacy, how are you today? 

01:45:40
STACY Today? Umm… I'm feeling really good, actually. 

01:45:40
TWINET PARMER It's good. 

01:45:40
STACY Yeah. 

01:45:45
TWINET PARMER What about you, Phil? 

01:45:45
PHIL I'm good. 

01:45:45
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. Very good. Well, let's get started. This is our next to the last session. And the last session will be our termination session, so umm… at the end of that session, we will talk about what this is meant you and what you will be taking away. So I just wanted to let you know that this would… we've already agreed to this and your insurance is only covering umm… you for one more session, so umm… we have a lot to do today. I'm interested in finding out how was your homework, as you might recall. Uh, you were supposed to do some things together umm… for homework. Uh, Phil, why don't you tell me about your experience, in terms of the homework? 

01:46:50
PHIL Umm… well, our homework was to sit and umm… really make time to have a conversation. Umm… and it felt really good. Umm… I felt umm… like I was heard. Umm… We can set everything up, we put umm… we put umm… little Stacy to bed and we, I mean, had a glass of wine and we really just, kind of, talked and I thought it went really well. 

01:47:15
TWINET PARMER And you? 

01:47:20
STACY Well, umm… pretty much what Phil said, we did, kind of, set the scene a little bit and we had some wine and umm… some lotions and candles and just really sat and talked. No TV or anything and it, it was, it was interesting without background stuff going on because I think I could really take in what he was saying and I felt like he really, umm… I felt, I felt more valued, you know when we… in that experience and that umm… I thought it was great. I mean, I loved it. Wish we did that more often. 

01:47:55
TWINET PARMER What do you mean "more valued"? 

01:48:00
STACY More valued, I guess meaning that emotionally he was listening or he was maybe umm… really listening and validating I guess for me what I think or feel at times umm… and it wasn't all about, about sex. Umm… I didn't feel like I was gonna be pressured or that it was gonna be, "Oh, candles, lotions. Okay, bam." You know, I didn't feel that, it was more like intimate. 

01:48:30
TWINET PARMER So there was that level of intimacy and closeness that umm… made you feel more connected to Phil in a way maybe that you haven't felt in a while? 

01:48:45
STACY Yes, in a long time. 

01:48:50
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. And what about you, Phil? Talk about how that made you feel, being together, made you feel at a level of connection and intimacy and so on? 

01:49:05
PHIL Umm… it was, it was really good. I, you know, we had a lot of good conversation and umm… things are going really well, you know, I thought it went really well and we still haven't had sex yet, but you know, it's a progress. You know, we're talking. 

01:49:25
TWINET PARMER Maybe it's the road to sex, huh? 

01:49:25
STACY Yeah. 

01:49:30
TWINET PARMER You are hoping. 

01:49:30
PHIL Yeah. 

01:49:35
STACY Well, we cuddled. We did cuddle a little bit. We cuddled. 

01:49:40
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. What did that do for the couple? Because when we do sex counseling, we are really treating the relationship and the relationship is that couple, so what did it do for you as a couple? 

01:50:00
STACY I feel like it strengthened our bond or brought us a little even closer. Umm… that we're, you know, it, kind of, helped me realized that, you know, we can be one together in a marriage, I guess. Umm… and it's okay, I guess. I mean, it's okay for us to be ourselves separately but I think what's been missing for me at least, is that, kind of, connection of us as a couple, what we are together… kind of. 

01:50:40
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. Phil, what about you in terms of that couple in that relationship? 

01:50:45
PHIL Uh, it definitely brought us closer together and I, you know, I see it more as a, for me, umm… I see it as making us more of a team. Umm… you know, when we set this whole thing up, you know, we, kind of, helped each other out, you know, getting, you know, the baby to bed, you know, setting everything up. You know, it was a team effort, umm… and it felt good. 

01:51:10
TWINET PARMER Stacy, I know you have said he's not always there for you, uh, that you wanted him and he wanted sex. How, uh, maybe you could talk about this at this point about what does that mean? 

01:51:30
STACY Umm… well, when I said I want him, I wanted, I want that, that closeness. Umm… And it's not that I'm against sex, it's just, I feel like that closeness… It's hard to explain but maybe that closeness will help the sex not just be about sex. I feel that… 'cause I feel that. I feel like it's just about oh, let's go in the bedroom… done, in the past, so I like that closeness and doing things together and like what he said, setting up and listening and talking, I like, I liked that. That's, I like… 

01:52:20
TWINET PARMER He said that umm… you all have done things together and worked together. Does that help you to umm… be more connected to him? 

01:52:35
STACY Definitely. I think so. 

01:52:40
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. Tell him what he did that was special for you and all of that. 

01:52:50
[sil.] 

01:52:55
STACY What was really special to me is that you…I felt like I had your full attention. Again, it wasn't just about my body, it was about what I was saying and feeling. Umm… Doing the set up together and putting Stacy to bed and all that, was pretty cool. I liked it, I liked feeling that we were in this together and I thought that was really special. I liked that the cuddling, it was really sweet and comfortable. 

01:53:35
TWINET PARMER What do you like about what Stacy did, Phil? 

01:53:45
PHIL Well, I really liked that. You know, we were able to work as a team and it didn't feel like I was by myself trying to umm… take care of the baby, you know, and umm… we had conversations about everything and it felt I was heard and umm… he didn't, umm… interrupt when I was talking let me say what I needed to say and it felt really good. Umm… Let me feel I was in control of my own stuff a little bit more. 

01:54:15
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. Phil, Stacy has said that you want sex but she wants you. Umm… Do you understand what she means by that? 

01:54:30
PHIL Umm… I think that about what she was saying for me, the way I see it is, uh, umm… sometimes I kind of rush things and you know, with life and stuff like that. You know, the baby, you know, everybody's gonna be quiet umm… I feel rushed to, kind of, get to the act. And sometimes I'm not umm… giving her the things that she needs, probably. That's the whole thing. 

01:55:00
TWINET PARMER That sounds like he is saying that he realizes, maybe that at certain times, he has not been there for you, and umm… that he hears what you are saying. Umm… Phil, would you say, would you like to tell Stacy that for you it's not all about sex, that you want her maybe the same way she wants you. 

01:55:30
PHIL Umm… you know, there are a lot of the things you've talked about and you do, do for me and I, you know, and I need to make a better effort of, you know, being a team and working on these things together and I need to make sure that I'm picking up my part of umm… making you happy and meeting your needs, umm… for, you know, for us to get into that, that level of intimacy. 

01:55:55
[sil.] 

01:56:00
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. How would you respond to that? 

01:56:05
STACY I'm really happy, actually. I mean, just hearing him say that even makes me feel valuable. It, kind of, makes me feel more than just… running around, away from sex, I mean, it just, it's really nice to hear that. 

01:56:25
TWINET PARMER So it sounds like that you all did some relationship building, some couple building and understand what it means to be connected to one another. And what was some of the specifics that you talked about and some specific things that you did that resonate with you? Uh, Stacy? 

01:56:55
STACY Well, we, we talked about, umm… his culture and umm… I do want to be more involved and I did go to one function and I and I umm… felt, I didn't feel as left-out, I felt like I was with him and not off to the side. I mean, I really felt brought in and that made me feel better, thanks to, thanks to Phil. And umm… in fact, that experience was very awesome to me and I just, part of me, you know, wishes I had that, kind of, connection with my own ethnic or a cultural background, umm… but I felt more like I was with him, part of his life. 

01:57:45
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. 

01:57:45
STACY And that was really awesome. What else? Umm… Oh, the job stuff we looked over, he spent still looking for a job, umm… shared that with me umm… and that was good. Umm… corrected a few things on there… a couple of letters but it was, umm… he's doing it. he's trying, you know, I feel like I'm a part of that, too. 

01:58:15
TWINET PARMER How is that different from the past? 

01:58:25
STACY In the past, umm… Phil would do his own thing and I would, I wouldn't say I'm not acknowledged in it, but I wasn't brought into it. Umm… whatever the, like the job searches or umm… his umm… his culture, I was… I did go to some things. I mean, I have and I always felt like I said in one of our sessions, I felt left out like I didn't fit in, that it was about Phil and his people, you know. Umm… And I just felt like, kind of, ignored, kind of, like, I'm not, again, not that significant. 

01:59:15
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. So that was just some things that made it different this time. 

01:59:15
STACY Yeah. 

01:59:20
TWINET PARMER Mainly that you were included and so on. And you were able to express that to Phil when you had this time together. 

01:59:30
STACY Yeah. Mm-hmm. 

01:59:35
TWINET PARMER Uh, Phil, what specifically do you recall doing at when you two sat and tried to connect at a different level? 

01:59:45
PHIL Umm… again, I just felt really heard. Umm… the employment stuff we, kind of, took a look at it together and we're both, kind of, in the same field, so she was able to help me out with looking at some other avenues that maybe I hadn't looked at before. And gave me some ideas on some places to maybe send out some applications umm… but I, kind of, showed her what I had and umm… I think it went over pretty well. I mean, most of it was there and we always would, you know…made a couple of corrections and stuff but we send them out and umm… she actually helped me out with that a little bit, which is, kind of, nice. Umm… and then we talked about, you know, the function that we went to was, it was a really nice. It was cool this year there and umm… it made me feel proud, you know, as a husband and as a father and, umm… to bring my family and incorporate them, you know, umm… into my life and, you know, the stuff that I was brought up with. 

02:00:50
TWINET PARMER So it sounds as though one of your early complaints was that, Phil, you felt stressed and that you were doing everything and Phil was running out to the tribe and you were not included and so on. But it… if I recall, Phil was saying that your attitude was such that he couldn't deal with because you were arguing and yelling all the time and it seems as though, uh, the way you all have connected now is, uh, has been a way to, let's say, move away from those, kind of, behaviors and umm… work at understanding one another and hearing one another. Is that right? Umm… what could you do to continue that and, uh, and make your relationship one and move forward to the next stage? 

02:02:00
STACY Well, I think that's really important that we umm… continue to make time for us, one at one time. Umm… I think that needs to be, to be there. I mean, it just… it has to be there for us to continue to grow in, in closeness. Umm… I don't think it's something that should be pushed aside. I think it needs to be up there with priorities. 

02:02:25
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. So it sounds like you are saying you need to make time for these, kind of, things. And if you make time, then you will focus on each other and that connection will be made? 

02:02:40
STACY Mm-hmm. 

02:02:40
TWINET PARMER Phil, what might, umm… you suggest, uh, as something you could do to continue to have this, kind of, time together? 

02:02:55
PHIL Well, first of all, obviously making time, well I'm I need to make sure that we have those, that time and set things up and umm… you know, put us into a place that we can communicate without, you know, interruptions of the TV, of the baby, of work or any of that stuff or, you know, or any of the events or anything like that. So obviously doing that and then I just, you know, I think that's probably the biggest thing for me is just having those conversations. 

02:03:25
TWINET PARMER And I heard two things. He was not groping you in a sense and pressuring you for sex. And you were available for him, understanding, uh, not demonstrating anger. Because you know, there is an old saying about how you collect, "Catch more flies with honey than whatever than vinegar." 

02:03:55
STACY Mm-hmm. 

02:03:55
TWINET PARMER And so it sounds as though they have been some vinegar in this relationship that had pushed the two of you farther away from each other. And in a sense, it just takes a little time. You have a good relationship already and you have umm… had some good times together and have worked on your relationship in the past. Uh, so it seems as though you just needed to stop, pay attention and so it will get back on track because a lot of times when there are stresses like no job, money is tight and things like that, we tend to be stressed and maybe angry and move away from our mate. Uh-huh. Yeah. Umm… we have five senses. You know, there's touch, taste, umm… sight, smell, hear and seeing. And in order to connect and communicate and it's especially important in sexual communication, all of those need to be place to address us holistically, that is mind, body, spirit and emotions. And so, just as an example, you can't do anything without one finger, without having the others. You can't do anything if you take this one away, these don't work. If you take that one away, you can't do anything. So, uh, the same can be applied to intimacy and connection and sex. In sex, you have to address all the senses, really to be whole and complete and really get the pleasure that one probably is seeking. What did you do in that interaction that addressed some of your senses that you pleased about? Uh, Stacy? 

02:06:15
STACY Umm… definitely touch. I mean, we cuddled and on the couch and umm… you know, I even had my head like here, it's, you know. Umm… that felt really good. I haven't done that in a long time. Umm… listen, I mean we did listen pretty well. I thought we listened very well to each other. Umm… the wine tasted good. Umm… is it? I don't know that the taste thing. I know that's, I don't… I'm joking but umm… I don't know, other than touch and well, and sight, and hearing. 

02:06:55
TWINET PARMER Hearing. Mm-hmm. 

02:06:55
STACY Taste. 

02:07:00
TWINET PARMER Maybe there was nothing to taste this time. 

02:07:05
[sil.] 

02:07:05
TWINET PARMER What about you, Phil, in terms of the five senses, what resonates with you? 

02:07:15
PHIL Umm… probably just be in her presence, you know the visual. I'm very visual, seemed like for long time, most of our, her communication have been on the phone. You know, we both have cell-phones or she's at work and she'll call me, I need this. Are you done or, you know, I need to get this done so I call her and we haven't been at face to face, really hadn't that, kind of, that communication, umm… so, you know, hearing her words and seeing her there and, you know, those are probably the biggest ones for me. Umm… yeah. 

02:07:50
STACY Mm-hmm. 

02:07:55
TWINET PARMER Anything else about that, that you remember? 

02:08:00
PHIL The other thing, hold a second… 

02:08:00
STACY Oh, go ahead. 

02:08:05
PHIL The other thing was, there wasn't no, the distractions that we usually have, you know, we set it up so that, you know, baby was asleep, were, umm… we weren't interrupted, which was nice, 'cause seems like again, with our communication we've, you know, we're always interrupted with something, you know. 

02:08:20
STACY Yeah. 

02:08:25
PHIL So it usually has to be very short and condensed umm… and this allowed for us to really have an in-depth conversation. 

02:08:35
TWINET PARMER So it seems as though, uh, you this was meaningful for both of you because it felt a certain way and you connected, and that was a level of intimacy. Uh, I'm wondering what, kind of, commitment you could make to one another that you would continue this and what, kind of, signal could you send to one another when, uh, you tend to be straying away from this level of closeness. So what, kind of, commitment would you be willing to make to fill, Stacy? 

02:09:20
STACY Well, that's a, it's really interesting. You said that 'cause I was just sitting here thinking, "Can we keep this going? Can we, you know, set this time? Can we set this time?" You know and umm… I worry, it scares me a little bit that once we get hustle and bustle again, then we'll let it go, but I see that we can't do, we cannot afford to do that. So umm… it does need a commitment, umm… I know I'm not saying it has to be the exact same time on Saturday every… but I don't know, I…What do you think? 

02:10:00
PHIL Umm… you know, I think if we don't set up the schedule, that I think that it will get lost, so I think we maybe need to be, maybe we even setting up like a date night, where we, we find a babysitter and we set those things out for ourselves and…you know, just take it out, just the two of us at least, you know. Umm… maybe once a week or, you know, at least at first, you know, I don't know how long. 

02:10:30
TWINET PARMER Yeah, at first, but isn't this something that you want to continue? You said at first, maybe do that. 

02:10:35
PHIL Right. 

02:10:40
TWINET PARMER What do you think about that it at first we'll go gung-ho, it sounds like we'll go gung-ho and then maybe slack off… 

02:10:50
STACY That's, kind of, like what I heard too. I was thinking that, you know, at least at first, we'll have it all set and we'll do it and then, umm… yeah, I've, it's just like well, what will happen after the at first, umm… it's something we need to, I mean, is it something that could come up spontaneously too, don't you think? I mean, if we have a quiet moment and we are recall or, you know, we could just even for a few minutes do the talk or snuggle thing without having it said. 

02:11:25
TWINET PARMER Let me interject here. I think I'm hearing two different things. You are talking about the time you spend together, let's say, that quality time and it sounds like you are talking about going out and uh, correct me here… 

02:11:40
PHIL Well, I think that quality time between us could be, you know, it could be at a nice, quiet restaurant or umm… you know, there are a lot of things we used to like to do quite often. And maybe getting back into that would be good for both of us. Umm… and I didn't mean I was gonna slack off. My idea, I guess was, I just feel… you know, we've kind of started this line of communication and we started talking a lot more. I feel like I have a lot of more to talk to her about, umm… definitely at least once a week, you know, and then, you know, and then maybe we can adjust it, you know, after a few months, just to see if we're both, if we need that same level, or if we need to maybe back down a little bit or umm… you know, it's scheduling and stuff like that with the baby, I guess. 

02:12:30
TWINET PARMER It's interesting. You just said, "I have a lot more to talk with her about." What does that mean? 

02:12:35
PHIL Umm… before, you know, we didn't talk about much. We, like you said, we just, kind of, called each other and it was very business-like and it seems like we've, you know, I've got a friend back who's now part of the team, you know and… and it just feels good. 

02:12:55
STACY Mm-hmm. 

02:13:00
TWINET PARMER Now, Stacy, you all… both were talking about your level of commitment to this and how it might be achieved. Umm… talk a little bit about how committed you are to this and what extent will you go to demonstrate that commitment? 

02:13:20
STACY I am really committed, fully committed to this. I mean, I want this to work, I want this. It felt so good to have him back, you know, closer like he just said, talking to each and not just passing each other in the hallway. Umm… and I, I just, I feel, I don't know, it's hard, I feel like I'm important to him and I love the way that feels. I love it, you know. I want to be important to you and you are important to me. You know, I want… and you know, I'm just, I mean, I know it's not perfect all the time but that feeling which we haven't felt, I haven't felt in so long is umm… just refreshing, I guess and I would really like to keep working. 

02:14:20
TWINET PARMER So I'm hearing you both say that you really enjoyed the connection, the one-on-one time, the connecting to the five senses, uh, and so on. And that you are committed to that because you know how valuable that is to your relationship. 

02:14:40
STACY Yeah. Mm-hmm. 

02:14:45
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. So since you've done that, we are going to take you to the next level and Phil might like this. Umm… let's talk about, umm… I have a bag of tricks that I carry around, uh, depending on the occasion, so umm… I talk with you about the book, "Sex begins in the kitchen: Because love is an all day affair." There's a newer edition of this book and I really like this. I like the catchy phrase. I think I've mentioned it to you previously. 

02:15:25
STACY You did. You did. 

02:15:25
TWINET PARMER What I usually do is ask a couple, uh, who's in for sex counseling to well, you came for relationship building but umm… sex is always a part of that. I usually ask them to go to the book store and uh, find, uh, a sex book or relationship book or something that would be an interest to them. But they are so few bookstores now, so I just thought I would umm… bring this to you and have you look at as homework, the book "Sex begins in the kitchen" and umm… interesting little then here, you can skim it, umm… another assignment I often give, after you've gotten the book, I want you to sit, I usually ask couples, you know, umm… if they could sit and read the book, read parts of the book together. 

02:16:30
STACY Mm-hmm. 

02:16:30
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. Uh, once, at was that was… this is just on the side, once I was working with a couple and I sent them to the bookstore, they were supposed to go together. And they went separately. He came back with a big manual and she came back with the small book of poems. So he said, "Why is your book so large?" And I said to him, because I had this relationship with them, had seen them for a long time. And I said to him, "Maybe you needed more help." And we laughed. So well, anyway, I'm not saying that about you, Phil, that was a joke. So here's the book, "Sex begins in the kitchen." Your homework is to cuddle and read that and then you have another homework assignment that involves… I know you already have the lotion but here is a lotion, umm… and this lotion will be used in your second homework assignment. I'll give that to you and you already have the candles. You are ahead of me on this but you already have candles, so here's a candle. Uh, since you have a candle, I'll just keep this and I'll let this be symbolic. Here's a candle and you can have the wine and whatever and I'd like you to do, this is a Masters and Johnson activity called sensate focusing and it's really, it's a massage process, a non-threatening, uh, where you both massage one another and you are supposed to stay away from anything, in general, tools and things like that, or anything that would be erotic and sometimes the assignment is not to have sex but I'm not gonna give you that assignment, you know, not to have sex. 

02:18:45
PHIL Okay. 

02:18:45
TWINET PARMER If you choose to have sex, you may. And so, here's the sensate focus. The aim is to learn how to achieve, how to relax, release tension and enjoy your body as well as your partner's body. And so you all have done some of this with the cuddling activity that you did in last session, so you are somewhat connected. So umm… here is just the instructions on sensate focusing for you. Umm… so I have, let's see if I have. I think that's all that would apply to you in my bag of tricks. Umm… let's see. So this is a non-demanding process and where you work it out, where each of you would go through this, do the massage and so on, and whatever happens, happens. Umm… I guess that would be it for today. I think that takes care of the homework assignment. Umm… let's wrap up today and, uh, as usual, I'd like to know, first of all, do you have any questions about anything? 

02:20:15
[sil.] 

02:20:20
PHIL Umm… next session will be our last session? 

02:20:20
TWINET PARMER Will be your last session. Uh-huh. Next session would be your last session. 

02:20:25
STACY So umm… when you said this isn't, like demanding… 

02:20:30
TWINET PARMER The sensate focus… 

02:20:30
STACY Okay. 

02:20:30
TWINET PARMER It's not a demanding… 

02:20:35
STACY Right. Okay, and well, I'll read it but… 

02:20:35
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. 

02:20:35
STACY Okay. 

02:20:35
TWINET PARMER Do you understand it should be, it should not be demanding sex, it should be something you relax and do, take your time, same kind of setting. 

02:20:50
STACY Okay. 

02:20:55
TWINET PARMER Umm… take… set aside a certain amount of time where you won't be interrupted. Oh, I had another thing here, I forgot that is always important in sensate focusing is uh, smell is important, so you got to do some "smell good.", okay now and… 

02:21:15
STACY Yeah, that smell's… 

02:21:20
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. Some "smell good" is always good. Uh-huh, because lavender or whatever, you know, whatever, it's up to you. You have to set the stage. 

02:21:25
STACY Right. Uh-huh. 

02:21:30
TWINET PARMER Phil, you have questions about the two assignments? 

02:21:35
PHIL No, I'm looking forward to it. 

02:21:40
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. Yeah. Non-demanding, but however, however it goes. Uh-huh. Okay. So you have, we've satisfied your questions. Phil, why don't you tell me what you might, what you will take away from today's session? 

02:22:00
PHIL Umm… definitely setting, setting the mood umm… I think, uh, I need to be a little bit more umm… aware of what she needs and umm… you know, and make sure that she's getting what she needs from me too. I'm getting what I need. I need to do the same for my partner. 

02:22:20
STACY Mm-hmm, Mm-hmm. 

02:22:25
TWINET PARMER What about you? What would you take away from today's session? 

02:22:30
STACY Umm… how important it is to put umm… our closeness and our oneness together at a time as a priority above things, that we didn't before. Umm… that we need to really continue that and make it part of our existence together. And the book, I'm really looking forward to reading the book too. 

02:22:50
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm Well, you have done some good work, although the last sessions and you did some good work last session. Umm… so I'll see you next session, which will be our last session. Okay, have fun. Okay. 

02:23:10
PHIL All right. 

02:23:15
TWINET PARMER Have a good evening. 

02:23:15
STACY Thank you. 

02:23:15
PHIL Thank you. 

02:23:20
Pause for Discussion 

02:23:20
TWINET PARMER Hello. Phil, how are you today? 

02:23:20
PHIL Good. 

02:23:25
TWINET PARMER Good, good, good. Things are going along okay? 

02:23:30
PHIL Yeah, they are going really good. 

02:23:30
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh, how's the job search? 

02:23:30
PHIL Umm… still, still in progress, but, uh, just been sending out a lot of apps and she's been helping me quite a bit, too. 

02:23:40
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. Good. Maybe that would turn around something for you. 

02:23:45
PHIL Mm-hmm. I hope so. 

02:23:50
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. Okay. So Stacy, how are you today? 

02:23:50
STACY I'm good. 

02:23:50
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. And what does that mean? 

02:23:55
STACY Uh, I feel pretty happy, pretty calm. It's been a good day. 

02:24:05
TWINET PARMER Yeah. Well, as you know, this is our last session. 

02:24:05
STACY Hmm. 

02:24:10
TWINET PARMER Yeah. Umm… and we need to talk about near the end of the session, we need to save some time to terminate and talk about what has been significant for each of you, umm… in during the time we've spent together. So today umm… let's, do you have any questions about that, the termination and… 

02:24:35
PHIL No. 

02:24:35
TWINET PARMER No what we'll be doing. 

02:24:35
STACY No. 

02:24:35
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. Okay. Today umm… I'd like for us to talk about the homework again. Umm… where would you like to start? Let's start with you today, Stacy? 

02:24:50
STACY Uh, I really liked the "Sex in the Kitchen" book. Umm… about the intimacy, it's not just in the bedroom but in all areas of your life, that sexual intimacy can lead to, like the little things, you know, in life with each other. Umm… I liked how it talked about umm… that we can look at things differently. 

02:25:25
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. 

02:25:25
STACY But that that's okay to do that. umm… And as far as like the intimacy, the sexual intimacy, how just the little things that you don't even think about, can relate to that, by just doing a little task for somebody or umm… for each other. Umm… I thought that was really interesting and I do like, I really liked it doesn't begin and end in the bedroom. Umm… Because I think the author is right, at least in my perspective, I read it. 

02:26:00
TWINET PARMER Phil, umm… what about you? 

02:26:05
PHIL Umm… kind of, an eye opener. Umm… you know, we talked about them in last session, about working up to, you know, being intimate and we, you know, she expressed some stuff when I read the book. It really, umm… I had to look at myself a little bit and umm… and I was that guy, you know, usually when she comes home, you know, I've been with the baby all day and I, kind of, want to kick my feet up, you know and there's one, uh, one excerpt in that book that, kind of, talked about, you know, just getting the dishes done, you know, she's taking another thing off the table, another distraction and umm… really kind of working all day at, you know, "Sex begins in the Kitchen", so I thought it was, kind of, interesting. 

02:26:55
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. What did that mean for your relationship? That the fact that you've read a book and there were some things in there that were of interest to you and that you learned from, what does that mean for your relationship? 

02:27:15
PHIL You know, for me, it means that, you know, I need to, you know, again set the mood. I need to, you know, work at it a little bit more than I have been instead of just umm… assuming that she is, you know, ready, when I'm ready, you know what I mean? 

02:27:35
TWINET PARMER Can we say "we"? "We need to," is that possible? 

02:27:35
PHIL Yeah. 

02:27:40
TWINET PARMER Because we are talking about the relationship, too. 

02:27:40
STACY Mm-hmm. 

02:27:40
TWINET PARMER Okay. Go on. 

02:27:45
PHIL And we need to be umm… thoughtful of each other, so that we are ready when, you know, we're both ready at the same time, so. 

02:27:55
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. Ready for? 

02:27:55
PHIL For sex and for intimacy and just being close. 

02:28:00
TWINET PARMER What does that mean for you, uh, Stacy? 

02:28:05
STACY Well, I know, I, I need to realize he can't read my mind. I saw a lot of that, kind of, come up a little bit in the parts of the book and umm… I need to be more forthcoming and not in an angry way but just in a gentler way. And what he said, umm… I think, I think you said something about building up to the, what we can keep doing to build up to the sexual part that it all, kind of, ties them together. 

02:28:40
TWINET PARMER Can you now talk about what we need to do in the context of what you have just said? 

02:28:50
[sil.] 

02:28:55
STACY We, uh, we need more, we need just. I want to say you. We need to slow down. umm… I think we need to continue the listening. Umm… We need to meet each others needs as best as we can. I don't know if that answered your question. 

02:29:25
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. Well, you spoke about uh, being able to communicate what those needs are. You said something about that and so that may be something that you can agree about as a couple, that we need to communicate to one another and not just during your cuddling activities, but also, you know, when you engage in sex. Now, uh, anything else about the book? 

02:30:00
STACY No. It was good. 

02:30:05
TWINET PARMER Now, uh, you had another assignment. You had the sensate focus. I see you are smiling. 

02:30:10
STACY Yeah. 

02:30:10
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. 

02:30:15
STACY Yeah. I liked it. 

02:30:15
PHIL We both did. 

02:30:15
STACY Yeah, we liked it. 

02:30:20
TWINET PARMER Okay, next question. What is that you liked? 

02:30:25
STACY I liked all of it. I mean, I loved the massaging, the touching, and I was trying to keep myself aware of the senses during it too. Again, like the smell, the taste, the touch, and it just, at least for us, did we even finish it? You know what I am saying? It's like about four hours. 

02:30:50
TWINET PARMER Ah! You had sex. 

02:30:55
STACY Yeah. Because it was, it was like, I don't know, it was so different. It was awesome. I mean, it was just, umm… I felt, how I felt really close. He's little, I mean, there's still, I mean, he took a job not jumping in too fast, but umm… I don't know. It was nice to be relaxed. Like, it's hard for… Well, at least for me to have an orgasm if I'm tensed or I've got a lot on my mind. You know, and then lay to other relaxation part, kind of, helped me settle there down and it was more enjoyable for me, too. 

02:31:35
[sil.] 

02:31:40
TWINET PARMER Notice what the exercise as you've done up to this point. Orgasm has not been the focus and that's one of the primary objectives is to get you to focus on, you two, on your five senses without having orgasm as a goal. 

02:32:00
[sil.] 

02:32:05
TWINET PARMER Well, what about you, Phil? 

02:32:05
PHIL Umm… things went really well. Umm… it's been a while, so it was, umm… you know, thinking about the senses, you know, all of them more kind of engaged and, um, you know. I made sure that I took care of some of the stuff during the day before she got home, kind of, set some things up to, kind of, set the mood and make sure we didn't have distractions and we did a couples night out, and, you know. Umm… we did, kind of, whole evening, kind of, worked at it all day, you know, all afternoon, actually. 

02:32:40
TWINET PARMER So when did you do the sensate focus? 

02:32:45
STACY When was that? Night? 

02:32:45
PHIL Yeah, it was, yeah, when we got home. 

02:32:50
STACY It was at night. 

02:32:55
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. And so that went well for you? 

02:32:55
STACY Mm-hmm. 

02:32:55
PHIL Yeah. 

02:33:00
TWINET PARMER Something you'll do again? 

02:33:05
STACY Yeah. I liked that lotion, too. Yes, it was good, it was good. It was nice. I mean, everything was nice. 

02:33:10
PHIL Yeah. 

02:33:15
TWINET PARMER Again, I hear you all saying that the five senses were tapped, you see? And even taste this time, before it wasn't uh, a part of it. So in this time, this particular time, all your five senses were tapped and it, you know, not just that physical part, but the whole person holistically, you were touched, when you can address sight, sound, touch, hearing, speaking, listening and all of those things. So what else can you say about the two activities? What else would you like to say? 

02:34:05
PHIL I think the biggest thing for me is again, setting things up. Like you said previously, I've been a guy who want to kick his feet up when she got home because, you know, I had a long day and not really thinking about her and her long day and umm… basically just, kind of, putting more of roadblocks to us being closer and intimate, when all I had to do is, you know, kind of, go the extra step and umm… her needs are met, my needs are met, so. 

02:34:40
TWINET PARMER Can you tell her what you would like to, what was especially meaningful for you and you would like to continue in, you know, in the process of this homework and having sex and so on? 

02:35:00
PHIL Umm… Well, you know, I love being heard. I love feeling close to you and feeling as we're a team umm… and, you know, really doing things together as a family. I felt very proud of you, coming in and doing those things with, you know, me and my culture and umm… I feel a level of closeness that we haven't felt in a long time. 

02:35:25
[sil.] 

02:35:30
TWINET PARMER Now in terms of the sensate foc… the homework assignment, can you tell her umm… something that you would like to uh, continue to do in terms of the homework, the sensate focus? 

02:35:45
PHIL Yeah, umm… I would, I would love to continue doing the sensate focus and I just mentioned before I'm very visual and umm… you know, touch is a huge thing and umm… it was, kind of, nice and I think it was a nice segue in to, you know, from our, you know, from working up in our levels of intimacy, you know, so it was nice. And, you know, I would not mind doing that again. 

02:36:15
TWINET PARMER So it was good to get to the top level? 

02:36:15
PHIL Yeah. 

02:36:15
TWINET PARMER You know, you have the work, the intellectual, the conflict and so on, and they are in there, if these things, many of these things in place, then you have the sexual intimacy. 

02:36:25
PHIL Mm-hmm. 

02:36:30
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. So it plays to take your time, huh? 

02:36:30
PHIL Yes. 

02:36:35
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. What about you, Stacy? What do you recall from the homework that you would like for you all to duplicate, let's say. 

02:36:45
STACY Okay, uh, again, the going, going slower. I liked, umm… umm… The whole senses, I think are important, umm… I liked. I don't I don't know, I just want to keep telling him what I liked that he did but he known's it was, it was just really paid attention and I hope that I was able to do that, you know, for you. Umm… It just felt more like, that it just, it was just not like, "Oh, let's have sex. Now I'm gonna go get a sandwich." It was meaningful. 

02:37:30
TWINET PARMER But let's… I often ask people to look at uh, their sex, sexual performance in terms of pre-sex, present sex, and post-sex. So what happens pre? What happens present? and what happens post? What, what is meaningful in pre-sex for you, Stacy? 

02:38:00
STACY I think, uh, the foreplay, I mean the kissing, the touching, paying attention, undressing. You know, all of that, umm… is really important rather than just pup,… pup,… pup… jump in bed. I think that, kind of, sets the mood, for sure. 

02:38:25
TWINET PARMER Sort of, like maybe "Sex Begins in the Kitchen" also? 

02:38:30
STACY Yes. Like, I mean, even a conversation. We could be sitting in the kitchen, having a conversation and that could be leading into like, an more intimate, sexual, even. 

02:38:40
TWINET PARMER Yeah, so, pre, what's important pre-sex for you, Phil? 

02:38:45
PHIL For me? 

02:38:45
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. 

02:38:50
PHIL Umm… obviously, kind of, making sure that her needs are met. I'm a little bit more, you know, whenever time is ready. Umm… but, you know, for my needs to be met, I need to make sure that her needs are met umm… as well, you know, because it takes two of us and we're a team. So… and, you know, knowing what she wants and it helps knowing. 

02:39:10
STACY Yeah. 

02:39:15
TWINET PARMER Do you know what he wants? 

02:39:20
[sil.] 

02:39:25
STACY Umm… I think so. I mean, we haven't like really said it out loud and not that I can read his mind either but I can generally tell by his, umm… his emotions or umm… yeah. 

02:39:45
TWINET PARMER So maybe it sounds like you need to have… 

02:39:45
STACY Maybe. 

02:39:45
TWINET PARMER …that sexual communication. 

02:39:45
STACY Yeah. 

02:39:50
TWINET PARMER Because we have something called sexual individuality where we are all different and have, uh, different needs based on our individuality, umm… that we would like to have met but so often we don't communicate them. It's hard to communicate. Anyway, in sexual interaction communication in sexual interaction is one or more difficult types of communication. 

02:40:20
[sil.] 

02:40:25
TWINET PARMER So, uh, it's… I'd like to say, it's like a menu and you draw, it's like, you know, seven course dinner. You go out to dinner, you gonna pick different things at different times, maybe. And so you have to communicate what's working this time and maybe not the other. And that's part of the pre-sex. You don't want to do it during present sex. So pre-sex, you want to discuss the things that you would like to take from the menu that particular time. 

02:41:00
STACY Mm-hmm. 

02:41:05
TWINET PARMER Now what about present sex? When you are actually in the act of sex? Is there anything that resonates with you that he would like to see different or change? 

02:41:25
[sil.] 

02:41:30
STACY No. Not that I can… 

02:41:30
PHIL I think once we are in to that, that point, I think every thing is, you know, works pretty well. We know each other well enough that once we get to there, we're pretty good. 

02:41:45
TWINET PARMER Sometimes it's, uh, especially for women, if, uh, there's something on our minds or the baby might be crying or the mother-in-law is in the house, we can't abandon ourselves in that process because we are only half there. And so that might be something that you pay attention to. If the baby is sick, or if something is happening, you may not be, especially for women, not to stereotype women but umm… if something is going on, elsewhere in the house, you may not able to abandon yourself and… 

02:42:25
STACY Right. 

02:42:30
TWINET PARMER …and really do the stages that lead up and back down. Now what about umm… post-sex? Any concerns about what happens afterwards? You said, "Go get a sandwich," is that something he does? 

02:42:50
STACY Well, I was, kind of, joking. 

02:42:50
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. Yeah. 

02:42:50
STACY Umm… I like to cuddle afterwards, just feel him close, an arm around me. A lot of times I will fall asleep, 'cause I feel safe and comforted. I like that. 

02:43:05
[sil.] 

02:43:10
PHIL Yeah, and, you know, I don't mind cuddling for a little bit, you know, after it's just, you know, afterwards you are warm and you know, you need a little bit of space eventually, you know, and I get tired, so, umm… I don't mind having a bit of conversation, but sometimes we, I feel bad 'cause I'm, you know, trying to keep my eyes open and, you know… 

02:43:30
TWINET PARMER Why? 

02:43:30
PHIL …we're in the middle of a conversation. 

02:43:35
STACY Tired, usually, we are both tired. 

02:43:40
TWINET PARMER So you, you understand your needs in terms of post? 

02:43:40
STACY Yeah. 

02:43:45
TWINET PARMER So we just need to able to umm… pay attention to our pre-sex needs, our present, at-the-moment-sex needs, and our post-sex needs. And it starts with that "Sex beginning in the Kitchen." And then that pre-sex will kick in and probably work much better for you and then, uh, there are certain things that are required of post-sex that you have to work out. But a lot of this has to do with our, our willingness to just communicate and talk about "This feels better this way," "I wish you would do this," and so on. And those, kind of, conversations cannot happen present-sex. It should happen post session… pos… uh, post or pre. 

02:44:40
STACY Uh-huh. 

02:44:45
TWINET PARMER Umm… let's umm… wrap up. Uh, do you have any questions or concerns at this point? 

02:44:55
PHIL No. 

02:45:00
STACY I don't… I'm just… 

02:45:00
TWINET PARMER Okay, let's talk about, uh, what this has been like for each of you and what you will take away? And for the takeaway, can we use my handy-bag here as a symbol for we'll use my handy-bag here as a symbol for your luggage. Let's say, you went on a trip and you know you have to pay for luggage now. Let's say you went to Hawaii and uh, you're ready to go home and you have too many things to go in your luggage. You have to leave some things behind but there are some other things you would not leave behind that you want to take with you. Let's talk about what you would take with you and then what you would leave behind and maybe why. Stacy, would you want to tell us? What you umm… would leave behind, and why you might leave that? And that's in the context of what we've done from across all the sessions. 

02:46:15
[sil.] 

02:46:20
STACY I'd like to leave behind my umm… my anger, my anger outbursts, umm… which after they build, actually just become more of a resentment. I'd like to able to leave that stuff behind. Umm… and then to take with me. 

02:46:40
[sil.] 

02:46:50
STACY Umm… I, I don't know. Well, I feel like I'm gonna take Phil, he's right here. I mean to take part of Phil with me, I guess, meaning his heart or his spirit or some connection with him to be with me, close together. 

02:47:05
TWINET PARMER So you are gonna… let's just focus on the leaving behind. So you are gonna leave behind your anger and so we put that in the… and we won't put that in the luggage. We'll throw that over there somewhere, maybe in the garbage or for the housekeeper. 

02:47:15
STACY Okay. 

02:47:20
TWINET PARMER What else might you leave behind? 

02:47:25
[sil.] 

02:47:30
STACY Definitely like to behind my interruption, interrupting him. And I've worked on that quite a bit, umm… but it's almost a habit, so if I could get rid of that, I would just like pitch it. 

02:47:45
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. 

02:47:50
[sil.] 

02:47:55
STACY And another thing I'd like to leave behind is umm… the distance we had between us. Umm… which was not a good place to be. I'd like to dump that one right in the ocean. 

02:48:10
TWINET PARMER So you have three things that you are going, go and to put in the garbage, make your luggage a little lighter now. So, Phil, what about you? What would you leave behind? 

02:48:25
PHIL Umm… probably my biggest thing would be the silence. Uh, the silence of umm… sometimes when we communicated previously, I would just shut down and I just wouldn't say anything. Uh, I think that it, kind of, was, one of our big, big things and I feel responsible for not speaking up. Umm… may be even mentioning the things I needed from you. Umm… So not having communication, the silence would be a big thing for me. Umm… and maybe not incorporating you as much that I could in to some of the cultural stuff and umm… I think all those things, kind of, bring us closer together as a family and as a couple. Umm… You know, I need that, that feeling of being a team, so. 

02:49:10
STACY Yeah. 

02:49:15
TWINET PARMER So is that it for what you would leave behind? 

02:49:20
PHIL Umm… I think I would, leaving behind maybe some of the pressure that I used on her to umm… get in the mood, umm… you know, maybe taking my time. Umm… you know, focusing on her a little bit as well, 'cause her needs need to be met as well in this relationship. 

02:49:45
TWINET PARMER Maybe in the future, you won't be as starved so you were kept. Just inside. Uh-huh. Okay, now, so those are the things we are going to leave behind, okay Considering what we have done over all the sessions, what would you take with you? Who wants to go first? You look like you want to tell us what you would take? Now of course, this would just be some of the more important things but I'm sure you would take a lot more with you. 

02:50:20
STACY I would definitely take the communication together. I think that's big, umm… I think a lot of it starts there, like when you are talking about telling what you need, you know, with the sexual intimacy and umm… if we don't tell each other, we don't… we don't know. So I think, the communication definitely… 

02:50:45
TWINET PARMER Mm-hmm. 

02:50:50
[sil.] 

02:51:00
STACY I don't know. The team, just being the team the one… feeling that oneness together, that I, you know, that we both matter together. 

02:51:10
[sil.] 

02:51:20
PHIL You know, me, I, of course, the team, I, you know that closeness is awesome. We haven't had a communication like that in a long time and it feels really good, you know. It makes you, you know, I think you can, I speak on both of our behalf's, like to, makes us feel wanted and appreciated and, you know, cared for. Umm… as well as, you know, for me, the other thing, the big thing I need to take with me is, the, you know, the "sex starts in the kitchen", and, you know, making sure her needs are met, you know, and some of that is through that communication so that, you know, she's… we've had these conversations and I know what she wants and what she needs, so I can plan accordingly and you know, make sure that some of these distractions are taken out of the equation, so we are not interrupted, you know, we have time for us. So making time for each other too would be a huge thing. 

02:52:20
STACY Yeah, me too and I want to. 

02:52:25
TWINET PARMER So you've packed your luggage and you've decided some things that you have to take with you. There are some other things that you are going to take with you. So you can close your luggage at this time. It's tight, you are pushing it down, but umm… you have the important things with you and the others, you are leaving behind. Hopefully, no one finds them and adopts those kinds of behaviors. Any, anything else, about that? 

02:53:00
[sil.] 

02:53:05
TWINET PARMER Well, what's been, uh, give me one thing that's been most meaningful for you. 

02:53:10
PHIL For me, it would have to be again, communication and just having those conversations. I mean, we, like you said, we haven't had that level of closeness in quite some time. And umm… it seem pretty apparent that once we, we started talking, we, kind of, found each other again and became like closer and became a team and umm… we got our needs met, so. 

02:53:35
STACY Pretty much the same, feeling valuable, feeling valued for each other and the communication and umm… being on the same, same team, umm… and not two different teams, so. 

02:53:50
TWINET PARMER Anything else you would like to say? 

02:53:55
STACY Umm… well, I'd like to thank you. We've talked about how much you've helped us and this has been a really good experience for us, so we really appreciate it. 

02:54:05
PHIL Yeah, thank you. 

02:54:05
TWINET PARMER And I want to thank you also for coming in and you were excellent clients, you were willing to work. You did the homework. And I think you are a great couple. Should you need to come back at any point, uh, maybe you start slipping back, let's hope not. You feel free to give me a call and we can set up something. I hope you don't, don't feel the need to come back, but if you do, you are certainly welcome and we'll work on your issues again. Umm… and Stacy, I know, early on you talked about, uh, some issues around your family. 

02:54:55
STACY Right. 

02:55:00
TWINET PARMER Uh, and this wasn't really the place to talk about them. 

02:55:00
STACY Mm-hmm. 

02:55:05
TWINET PARMER But you might at some point, uh, if that's a major issue with you, consider some counseling. 

02:55:10
STACY Right. 

02:55:10
TWINET PARMER Individual counseling and I'd be happy to refer you. 

02:55:15
STACY Okay. 

02:55:15
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. And also, I encourage you to start. Let your fingers start doing the talking and walking and find out who, what your culture. 

02:55:25
STACY Yeah. 

02:55:30
TWINET PARMER What culture you belong to. What cultural group belong to. 

02:55:30
STACY Yeah. 

02:55:35
TWINET PARMER Because everyone has a culture. Maybe it's not as evident and obvious as Phil's since he is, he hasn't always claimed his native American side. 

02:55:45
STACY Mm-hmm. 

02:55:50
TWINET PARMER Uh-huh. So umm… you might start talking to people, talking to family members and so on, if that's important to you. You all came in with issues of marital conflict and, uh, around not communicating around Phil's, the stress of Phil not having a job, around Phil not paying attention and leaving to be with his culture, his… the native Americans, umm… And then it involves… always whenever, generally whenever there are issues of marital conflict, there will be some issues, sex issues also because the more we have conflict, the more we move apart rather than moving close. And it's difficult to have sex and perform when you are apart. And so we try to not only work, find out what the sources of that discord, but also we looked at trying to move you back closer together. And to let you, again enjoy the pleasures of sex and engage and be in touch with each other at that level, which is the highest level of intimacy. Once the lower levels are, many of those have been addressed then we can address the sexual intimacy level. 

02:57:30
STACY Yeah. 

02:57:35
TWINET PARMER So it's been great and I wish you well and umm… again, I thank you for coming in. 

02:57:40
STACY Thank you. 

02:57:40
PHIL Thank you. 

02:57:45
[sil.] 

02:57:50
Pause for Discussion 

02:57:55
TWINET PARMER This video presented the case of Stacy and Phil. The title of this, the video is sexuality counseling. You want sex and I want you. This was the statement made by Stacy. It is symbolic of her perception of each of their views about how closeness is demonstrated in their relationship. This four session role-play, demonstrated how the role of unemployment, the influence of culture, and the lack of communication contributed to marital conflict. The important point here is how marital conflict influences all levels of intimacy and especially sexual intimacy. Initially, it was important to assess their level of commitment to the marriage, what they were trying to say to one another and to assist them in communicating to one another, their thoughts, feelings and needs. In this session, we demonstrated how cultural identity is a significant factor in relationships. Number two, how communication contributes to marital conflict and is often manifested in a number of unresolved issues. Three, how sexuality and intimacy become central themes in marital conflict. Four, how the couple was given permission to discuss sexuality. Five, how emotions like anger, frustration and distance can mask loneliness and needs. And finally, number six, how homework, resources and activities facilitated sexual intimacy. Hopefully, the work Phil and Stacy did in these four sessions will teach them the value of communicating with one another, the value of communicating about their relationship and communicating about how to incorporate the various levels of intimacy into their lives.
