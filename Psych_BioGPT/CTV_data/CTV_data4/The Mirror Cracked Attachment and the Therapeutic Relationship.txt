The Mirror Cracked - Attachment and the Therapeutic Relationship 

00:00:05
JUDITH MORGAN One afternoon, (inaudible ) working afternoon, I waited for Thomas to arrive. Thomas and I by now had quite a long association, and he was liked. I knew that sometimes, things were difficult before and after school and as I watched the clock, move five minutes past the appointed time, I wondered whether today had been a difficult afternoon. Perhaps something had gone badly at school. Five minutes more past before Thomas and his mother arrived. He came in wearing his characteristic grin and greeted me in the usual quaint way. By taking my hand and saying; Hello Judith. Naturally, I responded with a similar greeting and noticed out loud that today he was wearing ordinary clothes and not his school uniform. His mother explained that they had been to Brisbane for a number of medical appointments, hence the clothing and their likeness(ph). Thomas began, you know getting agitated that mummy was taking up his time with me by talking and asked when we were going into the playroom. His mother indicated she wanted to tell me something. So, I encouraged Thomas to move into the playroom and I assured him that I would be there in one minute. He did. His mother commented that an extraordinary thing had happened whilst in Brisbane and she really wanted to tell me about it, because she felt it was so important. I listened. Towards to the end of Thomas’ last appointment in Brisbane, which happened to be with the podiatrist. His mother explained to the podiatrist that they needed to be getting back to Toowoomba, where we live, due to Thomas having another appointment, that being me. Thomas’ mum had thought that he was not attending to the conversation, but he turned to his mother and the podiatrist and said; “Mummy, Judith Morgan is not an appointment, she is my friend. Now, at that point, I barely could speak and I thanked his mother for this generous piece of information and went on with Thomasand so forth. Now, (inaudible ) particularly proud or flattered by that, I thought quite humbled in fact and later on in the evening, I... we now had a chance to sort of digest what had happened and so forth. I suppose the recognition of the responsibility I have towards the children with whom I spend time really struck me, and it was this experience and many more like it that have brought me to this point today. I hope to share a little more about Thomas and other children later in this presentation.

00:02:50
JUDITH MORGAN Just an overview of what we’re going to cover today. I don’t have a whole lot of powerpoints. I hope you won’t be disappointed with that. These are things that we're just going to go through. So, this is where I work from. This is called Waterlily Garden Children's Therapy Centre. We have been... We established this place in 2003. We being my husband Bill who is sitting down the back. He is my security seeking person today. He seems a way surprised that I ask him to stay. I don’t think he understands that that’s my attachment thing. Hahaha... But… So… We bought this house. It was quite different from what it is today, not totally different. The old man whom, who, who used to reside in the house was called Mr. Jones. He was 91 when he passed. Three weeks after, they took him out of this house. It was an enormous garden and part of the garden is the lily pond. And these are lilies that grow in the lily pond. And when I get home, I noticed that the very first the lilies were starting to buds. I’m expecting that some of them will be there when I get home. The kids call it the Purple House. All sorts of other thinks. But, we basically spend about four months working on it, so we know it inside and out. All its cracks and crevices and so forth. So, I am a play therapist. I work predominantly with children and young people, with the occasional older person and their parents of course. And I've taken a very long route to get to where I am. I started off as a high school teacher, special needs teacher, and then I did some special Ed in communication disorders. And when I did that work I, I really wanted to work with mothers and children, because I saw that is the, the foundation of what goes on in later life. People laughed at me. Why would you wanna do that? They are... And then I did a... I was learning support teacher in schools, traveling in Western Queensland, and then moved into gardens and counseling, having done a master’s degree in, in that. Then... Having working with kids in that role I felt; Ah, it’s just... I couldn’t reach the younger children as much as I had wanted to. Things just didn't seem to be appropriate and I sort of feel into play therapy. As it were... I... I don’t think it was an accidental think, I think it's probably deliberate, but I didn’t know that was deliberate, at the time. So… And I’ve been doing that sort of work ever since, which is probably the last, probably 10-11-12 years now. And... And I’m very happy doing that work. So, it’s been quite a secured route to get there though. Now, what I generally try to do, because I am a play therapist. When I was originally going to do this presentation or had intended to defer it to be very experiential. As you can see, the numbers really don’t allow that to be so, unfortunately, but I always try to give people a little bit of a taste of what is involved with play therapy and a little bit of taste of things to come I suppose. So, what I’d like you to do is you'll see on your table, now there is a big wet patch in the middle, I’m sorry about that. That’s some baby bump wrappers. It's there for your hands after you’ve done this. There is a little blobs of clay. I’m gonna ask the nice man at the back if he could play a track from that lovely CD for us. What I would like you to do, there are some grease proof paper there for you to work on if you wish to. They might not be enough for everybody, apparently 5 meters, it's not 5 meters. And, what I’d like you to do is just as you hear the music, you use the clay in whatever way you would like to, to fashion something. If you prefer not to use clay, that’s fine. It’s your choice entirely. Perhaps, you’d like to draw something instead. And so, at the end of the song, we will just stop. Thank you.

00:08:25
JUDITH MORGAN Now, what I found really interesting about that was the absolute whilst you were listening and working on your clay. Some of you were, some of you weren’t. I don’t know what you made. Everything will be personal to you. But there was this total tranquility that filled the room, which surprised me not, because as I, it might, I don’t know, I don’t think it was deliberate on my part that one of the things that I did whilst I was preparing for this dye, was I actually had that music playing in the background quite a lot, and I found, so I was getting agitated. I wasn’t sure when, when Philip had told me that what I thought would be a small group became a larger group. I panicked. I thought; Ahh! God, I’m not gonna be able to do the usual thing like this! See, normally I don’t stay in here. Normally, I’m down there bouncing around, by doing stuff, you know, and I thought; Oh God! I got really anxious and I though; How the heck, am I gonna do this presentation in this way? And I had an email from Elizabeth saying; Are you gonna be at the podium? Oh my God! Played this and I found myself getting calm and feeling like I could, you know I could concentrate and I could start to do what I needed to do. Then I thought about it afterwards and I thought, few images could be more closely evocative of the concept of attachment than that of a child held in the arms of a parent who sings the child a lullaby. Perhaps to suede the child, perhaps to lull the child to secure asleep, perhaps just because he or she feels close and loving towards the child, perhaps for no particular identifiable rational race in at all. 

00:10:25
Hopes • Share material that may stimulate some thinking about the role of attachment in the therapeutic relationship 

00:10:30
JUDITH MORGAN So, today, I hope to generate some thinking about the role of attachment in the therapeutic relationship, and it’s importance in helping the individual to heal. The focus of my work as I said is predominately with children and young people and so we'll be drawing upon those examples. All of which are real, I don’t make anything up. And... But there is also relevance to the therapeutic relationship with people of any age. 

00:10:55
Thesis • Observable behaviours • Problem of attachment It is not the child who has failed, rather that someone significant has failed the child, or the failure of a system that failed to recognize the fundamental importance of attachment to the healthy development of a child • Attachment and healing 

00:11:00
JUDITH MORGAN The thesis, I guess to put quite simply today is that when children are brought for therapy or come for therapy, usually they’re brought, there is some wisdom though that says that it is the child who brings the parent. It’s usually a healthy child who brings a very unhealthy parent. I think there's a lot of wisdom in that. And... But, there, there has generally been a problem of attachment. The new therapeutic relation with the... relationship with the therapist presents an opportunity for a new attachment, and it is this attachment within the therapeutic relationship, which will help the child to recover and heal. The problem may have been that the attachment has never been well established in the first place or they may have been subsequent disruption to an attachment relationship or sometimes the child may have experienced multiple disruptions to attachment relationship, for any, any number of reasons. There has been a loss as a result of disruption to or absence of significant attachment relationship. So, what does this mean to the child or a young person? Of course, the presenting problem so to speak is often described in behavioral terms. Sometimes with an emphasis on physiological symptoms such as sleeping, eating, weighing, pooeing(ph), aches and pains. Sometimes, they emphasis on other behaviours related to the emotions such sadness, crying, solemnest, withdrawal, anger, aggression, fearfulness, worrying. Sometimes emphasis on behaviours related to change in school performance. Inherent... Sorry, interest in sporting and social pursuits. Absence of or disruption to an attachment relationship will multiple such experiences impacts upon the child’s experience of security in a deep way. Anxiety results, sometimes terrible. The child grapples to find a sense of security, a range of behaviors develops, which may present, may represent the child’s best efforts to feel secure or which maybe a reaction against the terrible feelings of insecurity and loss. Yet, while the child experiences such strong and often overwhelming emotions, he or she is likely also to lack the ability to regulate those emotions, why? Because the child develops the ability to regulate his or her emotions through interactions primarily though the attachment relationships where the primary caregiver is able to respond sensitively and accurately to the child’s emotional needs. The sensitive caregiver's role is to modulate the infant's arousal, which could also follow intense displeasure, fear, frustration, by calming the infant and restoring him to a tolerable, him or her to a tolerable emotional state free of anxiety. There seems to be a popular tendency in our society to what lie blind(ph) squarely at the feet of the child in distress. To punish the child with behaviors exhibited by the child often not the most enduring. However, it is not the child who has failed, rather someone significant has failed the child or a system within which the child operates that has failed to recognize the fundamental importance of attachment relationships to the healthy development of the child. Or perhaps it’s something significant that has occurred that has caused the disruption to one or more relationship essential in the life of the child and nobody thought to realize the importance of this loss to the child. Now, just the other day, and I’m not, so I’m not focusing only on relationships with parents here. I was provided with more than adequate example of this tendency to lay blame and to punish rather than to want to understand and relate. A quite a disturbing conversation with a teacher, who told me that she could not have a child in her classroom who was crying. Yeah! Okay! Your reaction is a bit similar to mine. I still have to ask quite directly; why? And I was a bit like you, sort of a little bit amazed, and I was told that it was disruptive to the other children in the class. So, then I asked another question, which was; how? And I was told that the other children asked the child what was wrong and looked in her direction. You know, this was the brand new description of disruptive (inaudible ), and I had this awful feeling of this dark and cold environment, then I thought; God no wonder this could cry is coming to school and doesn’t want to articulate to this lady what’s wrong with her, anyway. So, then we had a conversation, which, during which she sort of communicated to me more than adequately her lack of understanding of the centrality of the importance of relationship between herself and this particular child and probably generally. I thought to himself surely this is an opportunity to in gender the development of empathy and caring and the young people in her charge who seemed already, you know concerned about the crying child. When I suggested some alternative strategies to her, because strategy is a good word, you know everybody likes that word, alternative to her usual ones, which were publically demanding to know what was wrong, because it's my right that the teacher to know, those are her words, and to excluding the child from the classroom, I sort of seemed, what about drawing close to her and you know, using some soothing words that you understand, she is upset, other than demanding to know what the problem was, she went a bit cold on the idea of talking to me any further. So apparently, the suggestion that she could validate the child’s emotional experience and that might help to sooth her, didn’t sort of work too well. Anyway, but as I was writing that or actually was reminded... Excuse me, I’m just getting really hot up here. I had... Oh, sorry I’ll just skip, I missed a little bit here. It... What occurred... This little girl has had some really significant problems in her past, which is, you know having an impact in the present and I thought; Ah! You know, the successful teaching really does rely upon the quality of the relationship that one has with the students. And at this point, this little girl comes to school, she is crying. It's a wonderful opportunity for this particular teacher, many opportunities really. She has the opportunity to build her relationship, to draw alongside, the child be sensitive, assist her to learn to regulate her own emotions, perhaps she will be more able to do it herself in the future then. And she has opportunity to demonstrate the same sensitivity and empathy to all of the children in her classroom who were so well attuned to both herself and child in question, who knows what are the benefits that could have in the future. And as I was going to say, there be, a minute ago before, thanks. It was that a time bell? Oh! Hahaha... Okay, that’s good, thank you! Okay! I was remained of a situation that I had about 28 years ago. I had returned to work after the birth of my, our second child. She was eight months old and her sister was just on two. I was tired. I returned to school, there weren't many options then, you know, you'd had to return or resign and you didn’t resign because you lost your job forever. So, I was very tired. I went back in the middle of a term. One of the classes that I had was a group of 15-year-old girls, which you know can be really awful. And it, it kind of was, because I was replacing their favorite young teacher who'd gone off to have a baby and I was you know older and grumpier and tired and, and anyway, we, every day was a bit a push, you know because they were sort of, you know I wasn't very emphatic to their loss, I suppose. But anyway this particular day, I came in and I, I had my back to them writing something on the blackboard you know, putting some assignment or whatever and all of a sudden I was kind of aware that they were all staring at me, you know you get that feeling. And I turn... And I could hear this sort of muffled sobbing and I thought; Oh, God you know what is it! Anyhow, I turned around and there is one girl Lisa and she was sitting crying, and of course the girl sitting next to her was had her arm sort of close to her and, and I stood for a moment and I thought; Oh, Gee what am I gonna do? Anyway, I went over and I sat next to Lisa and I asked her if there was something I could do, you know whatever. No, no response, no, she just cried more. And... So, I just stayed there. Anyway, the girl next to her then popped up and said; Ah, that Lisa’s brother and his best friend had had a car accident the day before or the morning before or whatever it was, and that the best friend had been killed, and of course all the girls gasped, and then the half of them started, most of rest of them probably, as I, all started to cry, and so the whole lesson was just listening crying. We just sat there and then bit by bit somebody added something about, you know that Lisa’s brother that they knew and so on and so on. But it, that lesson was a watershed. That moment brought all of us in someway together. And we did actually went on absolutely joyously till the end of the year. I had every moment with that group of girls from that moment almost wonderful. And… And that taught me so very much about letting go of the things that are not terribly important, but to attain to those emotional things that may come up from time to time and... So that, you know I thought of that when I was... And I thought that for years, you know have those things sort of come to you? And so I did when I was talking to that teacher and I thought she got wonder if you realize, but anyway she obviously doesn’t. So, as a therapist, I see that the work I do with children is an attempt to understand what has occurred that has interfered in the development of healthy attachment relationships and to see what's disrupted, the child’s sense of connectedness to significant others and to allow an attachment between my... attachment relationship between myself and the child to develop that will ultimately allow the child to heal through this new attachment relationship that may in many ways be different from those previously experienced by the child. So, we're making new patterns and developing new ways. In what ways might these new relationship be different from others that the child has had.

00:22:30
JUDITH MORGAN Okay! Now, in this next... These are some of things that we’re going to just touch on. Now, the title of this presentation is inspired by the work of Donald Winnicott. Now, I don’t know if some of you may have heard of Donald Winnicott, some of you may not have. He was an English pediatrician and psychoanalyst who has written some brilliant work about children and their development, the family. If you haven’t read anything of his, I’ll suggest you do. It’s magnificent. It’s all there, he's been dead a long time, but it's still relevant and it’s still wonderful. But he said quite beautifully, and this is a quote; “In individual development, the precursor of the mirror is the mother’s face.” In referring to the nature of the relationship between the mother and the child, in the first instance, when the child looks into the mother’s face, what he sees reflected there is related to what the mother sees when she looks at the child. And this way, the child perceives him or herself through the mother’s face or presence, and what he or she sees reflected there in the mother’s face. The way in which a child experiences him or herself in this first instance, through the mother and his interactions with the mother. When things progress normally and the mother is good enough and predictably able to respond to the child’s needs, he is the guy who actually coined that phrase, "the good enough mother". If you're wondering where they came from. The relationship progresses well enough and the child develops relatively helpfully. However if for whatever reason the opposite is true and carries not good enough, then it is as if the mirror has cracked, creased(ph) and the child may experience a kind of chaos rather than security and a growing secure sense, growing secure sense of him or herself isn't possible. Through the reciprocal relationship between the mother and the child or the parent or other significant people, the attachment relationship deepens and grows. The development of a secured attachment depends largely upon the mother’s ability to a attune through the child, and so his or her physical and emotional needs. Her ability to do so communicates to the child a certainty. The existence of a predictable environment essential for the viability of life and a sense of security that makes healthy growth and development possible. Now, Winnicott was smart, very very smart, because he realized that the therapist is also in this role during therapy and that the patient also reexperiences himself through the face or interactions with the therapist, and he understood that the task of psychotherapy in I quote; “By and large the long-term giving the patient back what the patient brings.” It is a complex derivative of the face that reflects what is there to be seen. "I like to think", this is him still, "I like to think of my work in this way and to think that if I do it well enough the patient will find his or her own self and who will be able to exist and feel real." He goes on to emphasize this process of reflecting what the patient brings is not easy and that it is instead emotionally exhausting, but brings deep rewards. What he's describing so simply and eloquently is the process by which the patient develops an attachment with the therapist and that through the interactions within the attachment, the therapeutic relation, in the therapeutic relationship, the individual begins to heal to change. So, attachment is the fundamental aspect of human development and can be defined as proximity seeking behavior in an infant or child particularly when he or she senses discomfort of any sort including pain, fear, cold, hunger. The child comes close to or wishes to come close to a parent assuming that the parent will reduce the discomfort, restore the child’s sense of balance. It is on this basis of the parent’s responses to the child’s normal everyday inevitable cause for the response to his attachment needs that the child develops a sense of himself and the parent. And these form the basis of the child’s beliefs about himself and predictions about how he will be treated by others. I saw a brilliant example of this on the way to Stuart Island recently, the other day. The seas were mountainous. We started off, right, and everyone's; Oh… Ah… And then it became Ahaa… And I was terrified. I must admit, you know you look... We were sitting in the middle thankfully. Those people on the side, you know you couldn’t not look at the window and the sea was, you know the waves were slapping and banging. There was a little boy. There were two little boys actually sitting right across from us. The younger... The older one was quite good. The younger one though at one point about 10 minutes into the trip just billowed, and then I looked across and there he was. If he could have climbed inside of his mother, I’m sure he would have. He was a white and he was clinging and she was sort of wrapped herself right around him. I’m sure she was probably just about as sick as he was, and she just held him like that for the entire trip until we pulled in and then he got off. And I thought, that’s a beautiful example of the, the attachment and the proximity seeking behavior and look at what's happened and he managed to get off and he was fine, but he stopped screaming. He just started that way, but she responded so beautifully to what he needed and just provided that incredible, and I thought; Oh, it's just wonderful! But anyway... Now, so... And we know that those early attachment experiences form patterns that are likely to be repeated throughout the life span. You know, all of us do the same thing, that is until the individual develops a new pattern and the awareness of the old pattern that might not be healthy, etc etc. Now, I’ve got up here. I think I’ve left someone out, 'coz I’ve got five little examples for you. And what I thought was maybe you’d like to do, after I just read each one of these, if you just like to make may, maybe make a short note about what you think about each of these little people. Just say not sitting there doing nothing, you know (inaudible ), and then we can have a little share at the end perhaps. Just your impression of what’s being communicated by the child. Okay, so the first one is Jordan. Jordan ought to be, everybody thought, diagnosed some to be, some, being somewhere along the autistic spectrum. He was aloof. He had a raft of all odd behaviors. He didn’t make or maintain eye contact at all often. He pooed in his pants and he didn’t seem to care that others around him avoided him or complained about the smell. He seem to be quite bright, but didn’t show much interest in school work. He came to play therapy because his family was being supported by an intervention team, and the work was worried about him. He was happy to come. For a number of sessions he seem to play in ways that reflected the description that was given by other people although he did seem to play closer and closer to me. And I was very aware that he was monitoring me constantly. During the fourth session, he got up from the game he was playing on the floor, walked over to me, touched me very, very gently on the hand, just like that, and said; Will you play with me? Okay! That’s Jordan. Want to take a moment? Make a note! The next one, Issac. I encountered Issac in the waiting room. His mother in tears trying, though trying to be quite courageous in the face of his constant vex. His is only four, five sorry. He is trying to... He is really trying to hurt her and succeeding quite well. He came into the playroom in a fury and wanted to break and hurl towards, hit and kick at me. That’s always a bit of challenge when that happens. So, I acknowledged both his fury and his desire to break and hurt but remained firm, to be firm about the limits as in, you know I'm not to be hurt and you are not to hurt yourself and we don’t hurt the toys in the room. But, over there, you know there is a big box of cartons and polystyrene things and you can break those as much as you want to, if you want to. So, he took that option. He broke every single carton I had, smashed it completely to pieces, then he just stopped. And then he took up a rope and he told me we'd have to play tug of war. Okay! So, he instructed me that I had to pull him towards me. So I did. And as I struggled and fought... Sorry, as I pulled, sorry. He struggled and fought and pulled really hard in the opposite direction, kicked and fused and this went on, and it went on for 20 minutes. I was exhausted. I tell you, I was... And, then there would be a little bit of a rest period, and then he started pulling again furiously, you know I then responded by pulling again. And as soon as he, you know as soon as he got close to me he fought furiously to get away, terrified of coming closer and the terror, you know this (inaudible ). Okay, this is Issac. Next one, Michael. I remember Michael so well. I've got a lovely funny story about Michael, I might tell it to you. Michael and his mother, I'll tell it you after, after we finish this. Michael’s mother pushed him through the doorway of the pre-school each morning. And I am not. I am not... And this is literal. She literally pushed him in, and ran as fast as she could in the opposite direction. If the phone rang during the day... By the way, he was the beautiful, lovely baby, no problems at all, happy as Larry, placid, wonderful. If the phone rang during the day, she didn’t answer it for fear of the school calling her to come and get Michael. At pickup time, she coward as far away from the other parents as possible, in case there was a bad report about Michael’s behavior during the day. She heaved a sigh of relief if there wasn’t. It seemed that Michael couldn’t tolerate... Sorry, I shouldn’t laugh, couldn’t tolerate the other children or the pre-school staff interacting with him at all. As soon as they spoke to him, he snorted or growled at them. If I attempted to tell him to do anything or god forbid they told him to do some, they couldn’t do something he reacted by throwing over chairs, tables, storming off. The fact that Michael was quite a large build of child made it all the worse. He seemed very scary. My first encounter with Michael was at the pre-school, where he stood at the easel painting. Now, given that little description, what sort of a painting do you think Michael will be painting? Sorry, can I just get it any impression? Huh? No! He was painting lots of swirls and pretty colors, which I just couldn’t put together. And actually in all the therapeutic time that I had with Michael, everything he made was soft and fluffy and presence for this one and presence for that one. Okay! So, I just sort of squatted down beside to him, beside him, which was a bit of a risk because I thought, you know he could actually knock me over, but I did anyway. And I spoke to him of these colors in swirls. And he spoke back to me and smiled, and he asked me if I wanted to do some painting too. He asked me if I would like to do some painting too. That was my first encounter with him. Actually, I will tell you the funny story about Michael. I worked with him for a long time and with his mum, and we did some filial play therapy and... She was brilliant in the end. The funny story was that, she came in one day and she said; Oh, Hod! He had another bloody meltdown at the shopping center the other day! And I said; Oh! What happened? And she said; Oh, we got through that, you know this big doors! You know... And... She said he just chucked this (inaudible ) right in the middle of the floor, thrown himself down, you know and she's, you know arms and legs everywhere. And I said; Oh! What did you do? And she said; Well! She said; I just looked at him and I said I’ll be over there, and she just pointed you know like as if I went and stood just, I said I’ll be over there when you finish. And she said... I said; What happened? She said; He just kept going and then people started to gather around him! And he sort of looked up and he realized that people were looking at him and she said; He got up, walked over to me! And she said to him; Have you finished now? And he said; Yes! And she said; Can we go and do our shopping now? And he said; Yes! She said; Are you ready? Huh... mum I don’t suppose I’m going to be able to have an ice cream now? Hahaha... And I... And I just thought, what a long way we come, you know from pushing him through the pre-school door, but anyway. This is just beautiful. So, he lives long in my memory, that's Michael, he was a lovely boy. Okay! Now, what about Milie? Milie was six and had been removed from her mother’s care almost immediately after her birth, placed in foster care. Her mother maintained contact with her and her sisters and very much for to be reunited... reunited with her girls, but it was a very hard and long battle. I actually... I think about this family often as a very big example of what happens when there is, this systemic abuse as well, it's just awful. But I admire of this mum. I don’t know how she did it. How she managed to maintain the desire to be with her daughters? It was just a standing, they're back together now, which is just wonderful. In the meantime, Milie was in her first foster placement for 18 months, then suddenly removed overnight, placed in another placement with her sisters where she was constantly scapegoated, subjected to repeated medical invested gations(ph) to explain her aberrant behavior. As a result, she attended school only a couple of hours a day, regularly ran away from school, hit other children, a teacher, a career. When I met her, she, well, actually it was before she was shortly thereafter moved to another placement, settled into another school, doing a little bit better. First few sessions I had with her were exceptionally difficult. Even ordinary comments by me would bring vicious and accusatory verbal attacks, threats to harm me. I stayed engaged with her but maintained what seemed to be a safe distance for her by speaking very little and very quietly, and giving her only very fleeting eye contact. But tiny bit by tiny bit she began to tolerate me. So, that’s Milie. And then the last one, I haven’t put on here but Sebastian. I’ve included him because it's interesting. He was... He's a very happy little boy to come into the playroom. His excitement was almost palpable. His play would start and stop every evidently. He was hyper vigilant. As soon as he heard or saw something that was frightening to him, play was interrupted. He would come closer to me saying something like I'm playing right over here close to you and then he would go on playing again. At one point during this session, he rushed over to me, just imagine this happened in a split second, so I had no chance to do any sort of... anything. Rushed over to me, hugged me briefly, hugged me briefly and put his face right up close to mine, and then went past me, past the large (inaudible ), and said he was very scary, and then he went and got another toy that he wanted to. Okay! Just have a quick sharing amongst yourselves about what you think about those. What notes you... If you’ve made any points about some of those.

JUDITH MORGAN Okay! Now, I realize we could probably talk for ages about this, but I'd just like to say that in each of these cases a significant number, a number of significant things are being communicated. First of all, the child’s communicating, his or her experience of significant attachment relationships within his or her life. It's not conscious, it's not planned. Unfortunately and often as in the case of children people tend to believe that the behavior they exhibit is some premeditated and constructed viciousness designed to bring as much pain as possible to the adult as possible. As a result, adults often respond with punishments or consequences, punishments by another name, and also designed to bring as much pain as possible to the child. What results of course is the probable reinforcement of the pattern that’s already unhealthy and unhelpful for the child. I don’t imagine six-year-old Milie had any other way to communicate the pain of her constant rejection than to reject others nor Michael for that matter. The attachment relationship is being played out within the therapeutic relationship, and the therapist will be represented with repeated opportunities to provide a safe nurturing predictable environment. And predictability is so important... Yeah, kids come in there with one toy, it's in a different place. I have one boy who couldn’t find a plastic, you know a card that goes with the cash register; Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? You’ve hidden it, you’ve taken it. Oh my god! Terrible! In which, the therapist is gradual and attuned to the child’s emotional needs. When Sebastian in a flash rushed over and hugged me and held his face briefly next to mine then went on to play, he was using me to reestablish his sense of safety, to return his anxiety to a tolerable level. I was a tool that, by which he regulated his emotions if you like. But in order for him to do that some attachment had to already have been established. An attachment relationship is developing within the therapeutic relationship and the therapist's responses to the individual child and relationship with the child within that context hold the potential to help the child heal and learn a new way of relating. Jordan took a great risk that day. After all he went to great lengths to maintain his isolation from other people, pooed through his pants, you remember? Yet in that moment, he began experimenting with what was for him a new way of relating. And Issac well, we had ropes for a few more sessions then it stopped. He still protested somewhat, but then when I didn't fall apart in his protest he suggested we could play a game together. We still play games together, but he is no longer hitting mum, and mum's finding new ways to relate to him. Now, I have a couple of quotes here or some references here by L. Gabbott, you know look I like apologize I had intended to bring a list of references for you and I didn’t, so I apologize for that, but if you are interested I guess we can, you can, I can email or something. He suggested that psychotherapy is a new attachment relationship which is able to restructure attachment related, restructure attachment related implicit procedural memory. He goes on to say that, he made this observation which I really like, therapists are often disappointed when they see former patients and ask them what they feel was the most benefit to them during the years they are in therapy. Much to the display of the therapist, patients often do not remember any of the psychodynamic formulations or interpretations that the therapist carefully constructed to provide insight, instead they remember a joke the therapist told, a belly laugh they shared, a moment of emotional connection, a glance exchanged between the therapist and patient when a special form of closeness was felt. It is further considered that these moments in therapy, therapy are a form of implicit relational knowing when something emotionally reparative transpired, transpires without involving the realm of insight or cognitive understanding. Such moments would seem to be crucial to the development of attachment within the therapeutic relationship. Now, they're also genuine, sincere, warm. Now, I just wanted to share with you a moment that occurred between myself and a four-and-a-half year old Angelina, and it was a fleeting moment were didn't realize something. Now, she had been for several sessions of therapy. She didn’t stay very long. Her mum didn’t want her to stay very long. Her mum couldn’t handle it. She is a very pleasant little girl. I found her very pleasant, who quite, who's very disliked by her mum, essentially due to the fact that mum saw too much of herself in the child I think and as a result tried desperately to over-control her. Angelina’s way of coping with this was essentially to buck the system at every opportunity, and what ensued was many head-on clashes with her mum. In play therapy, she let me know straightaway that she knew what the rules were and that she was sure that there were gonna be lots of them. She had a place up (inaudible ) that I knew her straightaway what was going on her. It was a surprise to her that they were very few rules she made sure she let me know that she hated rules of any type and really pushed it. She constantly looked my way to see what my reaction would be whenever she felt she was about to break a rule. A very intense and unhappy little girl. Now, during the (inaudible ) therapy situation and you're talking with children and commenting on what they are doing and so forth, it's very rare that you actually use their name. Okay! Now, in this session, you know it's not deliberate, it's just that it doesn’t happen. But during this session, this fourth session I made a comment that included the use of her name, Angelina. She stopped, stock-still, and she looked at me, and she said; You said my name! And then she smiled, really broadly. And I said; Ah, you really liked that I called you by your name? And she said; It must mean you like me! Well, we had bit of a conversation then, didn't we, about her wanting to be liked and so on, people not liking her, how important that was, but you see that’s that moment and she realized there was something different happening. So…

Allowing the Pieces to Come Together • Creating the conditions for growth and change • Theorists • More than empathy… • Suspicion and doubt • Chaos and mess • Testing limits and relationship • Awareness of and responding to the compulsion to repeat patterns of the past 

00:47:15
JUDITH MORGAN Now... (Inaudible ) for time? Oh, God! Okay! Right! Well, what I might do is I might just... I might do a little bit of skipping through some of this. First of all, we understand what we, the task really for me is always to be able to create the conditions to allow the relationship to develop, but also allow the child the pieces to come together, so to speak. And we know, I mean to drawn a various therapy, various theorists, we know that essentially it's important to develop a safe, nurturing predictable environment. Now, I mean, I was going to go through a whole lot of different things here, but I won’t do that, because I want to move on to some more important things. And... But one of the, one I will mention which I think puts it very well, is a fellow and you may not have heard of this man's work either, he is an Australian chap by the name of Russell Meares. You may have heard of his father’s work Ainslie Meares. But... Or you may have heard of him, I'm not sure, a couple of nodded heads. I really like Russell has to say, you know. I’m going to read a little quote of his, because what I wanted to do here was to link the importance of play, of course for children which we will know as very important for healthy growth and development, but it's not just for children it's also applies to adults and the play takes many forms of course and that the spice that people share between themselves, what happens there is really play. But Mears articulates the nature of play in the following way. The play of a very young child has peculiar characteristics that include the nature of the relationship with the other. The form of language and an absorption in an activity that is similar to that of an adult who is lost in thought. The field is of play is where to a large extend a sense of self is generated, which is really important but then the thing that I really like that we must remember is that, if the child feels that he or she is alone and that means alone from the point of view of not aving internalized the sense of the other, play will not be able to go on. So, the child who is highly anxious, the child who has poor attachments, the child has not really had a good experience of attachment. Play may not be able to be established at all. You know, I’ve had, I mean, it probably sounds odd to people, I don’t know, I don't know how many of you work with children at play sense it all, but I've had children who come into the playroom and who you can see that they want to play. The room is full of toys for goodness sake, they stand in the middle of the room and you can see them looking around and you know that they want to but they just can't. The anxiety is so great, but then when they do take a tiny step even if they put their arms down, even if they look, you know you think oh, well at least we, but this idea that to have internalized the sense of the other and to be, to know that the other is with you even when they are not physically present is terribly important. Some other people, you know a paper by O'Connor and Burn, I like what they had to say also is that children, a child’s usual response to perceive threatening environment is to stop exploration and play until safety could be established by the security of an attachment figure after which play could resume. It's very important. Now, I’m going to tell you about Aiden. He was four and never stoop. His sleep was disturbed so much that his foster mother, that she had him since he was three or four weeks old or something. Sorry, he's now four, alright. Slept beside him so that he could keep at least one hand on her all night long. He couldn’t bear to be apart from her or his foster father. Terrible tensions ensued if he was alone. He maintained constant movement, couldn’t settled at anything for an extended time at all. Early on in the... Hahaha... Early on in the therapy, he constantly asked me; How long it would be before he got out? Hahaha... I... It was very strangely disconcerting to hear that phrase, you know it maybe 40 times in a session. I had this horrible, it was, it wasn't like he didn’t want to be there but it was just weird, just sort of how long before I get out? When am I getting out? You know, it's just like you are holding in there against his will, it was awful. Gradually over time he engaged more and more, but the day that he didn’t ask at all; God! I felt like having a party, I'll tell you what. He’d been going well and his tensions got less and less, but two things happened that really alerted me. One day... And see, you know when you are working with people sometimes you’ve, you know you see the changes and you loose track though, and one day after the therapy session he came carrying all these things that he'd made, you know, and his dad says to him; Oh, wow you've been busy! And then he said to me, he couldn’t concentrate it well enough to do that little while ago and I thought; Oh, no he couldn’t have, could he? Oh, okay! Then I had a phone call with his mum, and about a week later and she said to me; Aiden's now spending to around about half an hour a day in his room just playing with his legos and things. And I thought; Oh! That really struck me. You know she didn't sort of say it for any particular reason. Aiden's able to play on his own in his room. I wonder if you know why that really struck me? Huh? Yeah! What is that... What is that actually main now? Yes! He's beginning to develop a real sense of security, a sense of attachment. He's internalizing that sense of the other. I felt so happy, you know it was just wonderful. So then on I went on to explain that to his, his foster mum, because you know it was just so, so important. Okay! Now, I’m sure we are all familiar with the desirable therapist right such as ability to listen actively, be empathetic, authentic and so on, but for me these are important too, but it's as if they're instruments through which therapy relationship can be established, begin to be established and trust and so forth can be begin to be built. But again, I'll come back to the idea that it’s the attachment within that, that is important and just as in life the parents attachment with the child deepens as difficult period such are adverse and survived and coped with, so it is within therapy. Parts of therapy... The path of therapy really runs smoothly, it's often fraught with difficulties, unpleasantness, sometimes down at ugly times, often the therapist may feel anxious at a loss driven to find superficial solutions to complex problems or to repeat the patterns that have previously existed. However, there is one thing I have learned that it is, it is, there is much to be gained in not caving into my own anxieties and taking actions that it would be eventually counterproductive. However, I seem to need to learn that lesson over and over. Now, I’m going to again share with you some examples, because within the therapy we seem to get you know the beginning, the suspicion and doubt, the chaos and mess and testing limits in relationship. And it's very important as soon as I get a kid who starts to test, I know that they, that’s a good sign because we are getting somewhere, we are getting deeper, we're getting, you know they, they're getting, they're really getting gain enough to sort of show the things that are really bothering them and so forth. I had thought that perhaps if after each of these you could just do a quick little line drawing of your impression of each of these kids, because I think it might be, might be fun. Holly is seven, solemn and withdrawn, attractive girl who simply just didn’t smile rather instead wore a permanent scale. For the first few sessions, she just stood and looked at me from a safe distance, occasionally picking something up before putting it down again, any comment was met with either a derisive look or a comment, a derisive comment. She was clearly suspicious and doubtful of me. Moved into making remarks about how dumb I was, how stupid to accompany all those derisive looks. I quite frankly fought off personal feelings, her personal hurt that her boding remarks tended to inflict, not pretty good. I felt often like ignoring her, withdrawing my attention or were still telling her what sarcastic little pain in the backside she was and perhaps she'd rather come to play therapy anymore. But that would have been to repeat a pattern that had already happened. Of course she was doing a brilliant job of informing about her life experience in relationships. And if I had acted in ways I described I would have been falling into line behind a whole lot of others who'd done the same cruel thing to her. Instead, I reflected to her that she wasn't sure about me, seemed to want to hurt me. Thereafter, suspicion and doubt began to give way to more relational sharing. That’s Holly. Now, as to chaos and mess. So you can do a drawing of Holly if you like. Your impression of Holly. This is another little girl who is going to live forever in my memory. I think... I don't think I'll ever forget this child, Violet. Very quickly I realized I had to leave about a half-an-hour after appointments with Violet. The playroom had almost entirely been turned upside down. Everything that could be moved was moved. It took a long time for me to restore it. She'd come in like a world-wind, and every corner of play, playroom was just chaos and messed. She verbalized constantly and loudly so much so that I couldn’t squeeze in a word of observation, reflection, nothing. In the end there seemed to be little point, what were words in this sort of chaos and mess. Meanwhile, in the real world she was doing the same thing. But the response at school and home was to control and to punish, but that really wasn’t helping. She had lost both of her parents in a short space of time. Prior to her mother dying she herself had a very serious car accident and was very seriously injured. Nobody is sure about the circumstances of her mother’s death apart from the fact that she was left alone with her body for an unspecified period of time and at the age of four years and was found wandering around there flat thirsty and hungry. Her distress cries had finally alerted neighbors who broke in. Those early years had been very neglectful. She went to live with her much older father and his wife who were somewhat reluctant to have her due to their circumstances, but did care for her. Two years later, her father died of a heart attack, step-mother kept her, but was reluctant. Gradually in the therapy, Violet calm down and began a series of sessions where she would drag the mattress of a little paint in the corner, drag the mattress, pillows, blanket out and make a bed for herself quite close to me. Now, when she started doing this, I thought; Oh! I didn’t have a clue what was going on either and; Oh! what's she doing, you know? Should I stop her from dragging everything? Okay, I trusted! So she covers herself up with the blanket. Sometimes she would ask me to tuck her in and she'd get the baby bottle, always have a baby bottle full of water and there she would lie sucking on the baby bottle, covered up, cupped in and then she began to ask me to sing her a lullaby or tell her a bedtime story. Now, I don’t think I can ever probably communicate the position that I was in at that point. I mean, I was almost unable to speak little I tell a her story, but you know when I would say, what story, because the emotion that was in the room was incredible. What story do you want? Always want Goldilocks and the Three Bears, so there we go. This... Anyway... So safe in this predictable environment she began a long series of sessions in which she regressed. Recreating her earlier traumas little bit by little bit, while at a same time forging a relationship with me. New attachment relationship different from those she has experienced in the past, very emotive, very emotive times with Violet. How much time have we got? I just want to... Oh good, okay! So, perhaps you'd like to draw Violet, any impression of her. And then I'd like to tell you, this one is testing the limits and awareness of responding to repeated patterns from the past about Jacob, and I’m going to give Jacob the title of the most difficult child, I think I’ve ever worked with. And like a lot of children, I don't know but you know you get a referral and you except a two-headed monster to walk through the door. When Jacob came, you know he this tiny, tiny little boy. And I couldn’t put the two things together and I still sort of can't in so many ways, but you know. Now he'd witness, witnessed a lot of very severe domestic violence and he had also been the recipient of repeated physical abuse. He had been rejected by his mother, and was then living with his grandparents. Now they wanted him. They did want him, but they didn’t want him. They didn’t want the aggressive, out of control and in their words psychotic Jacob. Okay! That behavior was so difficult for them. They were older, you know. Grandfather had been in the Navy. He expected order and obedience and that was very difficult for him. When his behavior escalated they would try all manner of things to bring him under control, including threats to put him into foster care, have the police take him away, send him out to the paddock, you name it. He was small for age and on cocktail of medications that frankly I don’t think did much. Therapy with him was difficult, very difficult. It started in a kind of hyperactive world, preceded into a brief period of calm followed by a long period of very intensive abuse hurling, aggression, extreme testing of limits. With session after session, existed of nothing but drawing of boundaries, and silently this is on my behalf, silently hoping it would come to an end and I mean hoping it will come to an end. Finally, it did, and Jacob began to show the terrible fears that plagued him session after session, after session, after session. Invasion, beating, death. The testing still existed, but to a much later, lesser extent. One session that is very clear in my mind, Jacob wanted me to play with him, to help him build some figures out of clay. So, sitting opposite to each other and quite a long time you know we're making these little clay figures, it’s great, I thinking; Gee this is lovely and wonderful! Suddenly, he beings throwing the clay at me, full in the face and I was you know it was quite relaxed. Hahaha... It took by surprise and he became very nasty and it really hurt and I don’t know how I did it. But I just, I guess I put my hand up to shield my face, but I just said to him; Jacob it's not okay for you to throw clay at me. We don’t hurt each other in here, we have to safe. And you know I, I took pun, you know I said you know it’s really, because I didn’t know if he'd understand what I was going to say to him. I said it’s strange. One minute you want me to be able to play with you and you seem to be enjoying that and the next minute you’re throwing clay at me like you want me to go away. If you don’t want me to play with you, just you know you can tell me. Well it's a bit like one of those watershed moments, because I really wasn't sure how he'd take that, I thought it might have been a bit much for him you know and he just looked at me and he said well we had this discussion about. He did really want me to play with it. I don’t understand he said why do the things that I do and we have this discussion that he, he wanted people to like him, but he couldn’t help himself. He would do these things and he didn’t understand why and so on. It was very, very interesting session. But as times went by there were many eruptions and upset that were like that, but they became less and less and he was increasingly able to bring himself under control and to be able to regulate his emotions. So that was that was impressive, but it was very hard. But he had to learn that new pattern that was different from the one that he'd, from which he'd come.

JUDITH MORGAN The children in each of these stories has experienced very difficult circumstances in their young lives, neglect, abuse, domestic violence, removal to and from and suitable foster placements, significant assaults to primary attachment relationships, which resulted in behavior that to the observer seemed aberrant, required correction and control, punishment, consequences, all of which often serve to reinforce the patterns the child had learned from the beginning. Patterns that inform the child of his or her you know worthlessness, badness. Patterns that told the child that he or she would be rejected, oscillated, shut out, blamed, hurt. Patterns that communicated to the child that the world was unsafe and unpredictable full of people of whom he or she needed to be weary or it could go on. The therapeutic relationship is an opportunity for the patterns of the past to be unlearned and new patterns to be learned in it's place. However at the center of this development is, is the development of the attachment relationship within the therapeutic relationship. In order the attachment can be allowed to develop. It is the anger, rage, fury, hate and all manner of other strong emotions can be tolerated and absorbed by the therapist in fact that all aspects of the individual can be tolerated, absorbed, understood, excepted by the therapist. And you must be... You must be aware for the potential, of the potential for the individual to compulsively repeat the attachment patterns that he or she has internalized at least since infancy and take care not to collude with those patterns. In this way through the new gradually developing attachment relationship, the child learns new ways of relating, begins to experience a new security and predictability he or she may not have experienced before. But change is slow and the path is really ever smooth. Often and just as things seem to be improving the child’s anxiety can become quite acute and a new round of testing limits of the relationship will begin. However, every time this occurs there exist the opportunity for the deepening of attachment just as it does between parent and child, so it does between patient and therapist. Sometimes the child can test the limits very subtly in a very sophisticated way. So, the possibility of colluding within all patterns is almost imperceptible. Let me give you an example of this that happened to may probably only about a month-and-a-half ago with Catherine, who is now ten. I worked with her when she was six, after she disclosed to her teacher that she had been sexually abused by her father. I think the family knew about it prior to that. She settled down after sometime and I didn’t see her for a couple of years. But then her mother brought her back due to escalation in her anxiety and some difficulties with behavior. I have been working with her this time around for a couple, for a year I think it would be. During this time she has gone through a number of periods that were difficult for her and her mum. Just recently, she seems to have really settled, not so anxious, mum and her are getting on a lot better. And I was even beginning to think it was time for her to... to be finishing you know. Now, during this particular session and I’m not sure as I constructed this what the context was and what provoked these comments, but she looked at me very seriously and she said to me someone must have done to you what happened to me. You know my sense of comfort at that point was completely gone and I inquired what she, what she meant when she said, well you really understand what it's like for me, so you must have had also things happen to you when you were a child. Yeah! I was pretty uncomfortable. When I get really uncomfortable, I get this tightness around my kidneys, you know and I got that. And I thought; Oh! My god, I’m going to have to be really careful what I say to this kid right here! I knew she was testing but I wasn’t sure you know what. So I thought if I answered without due care I could run the risk of colluding with patterns of the past, you know and I said I’m pleased you feel that I can understand you well. Most people have had awful things happen to them in their lives when they were children. But, no I'm not going to talk to you about any of things that might have happened to me when I was a child. I thought she'd be happy with that. No! She kept at it. She said, but someone must have abused you for you to know what it's like for me. She couldn’t have got more direct, could she? God damn! Then I said again. Most people have had something awful or sad happen when they're children. Yeah, that’s right isn’t it? But I’m not going to talk to you about that. Was she satisfied with that? No! She looked at me. She said was it your mum or your dad? And it wasn’t just, it was this... you know she has got beautiful blue eyes and she just stared at me and the look and I thought; Oh, my god! And I went cold and low you know it was just unbelievable. This time I thought I had to go a bit further. So, again I acknowledged that she felt that I understood her and so on, and then I said directly to her. I said Catherine, if I do that, if I was to talk to you about anything that happened to me when I was a child that would be the wrong thing for me to do, because you are little girl and adults are not supposed to burden children with such things. It would be wrong of me to frighten or worry or upset you. Finally, she said no. But you see she was really trying to get me to do what other people had done to her. So, I was just thankful that she shut up, because I don't know if I had anything else left in me after that, it was very trying. So... Anyway...

Magical Moments • A new attachment relationship…. -Keegan - Thomas - Millie ……and healing 

01:13:00
JUDITH MORGAN Oh! Yeah. We’re coming towards the end. I hope I’ve enough time to. Oh! good, alright! I did want to come back to Thomas. I'm not talk about Keegan and Millie, I would like to but I won't have time. I'm going to return to Thomas. I hope you'll indulge me here with Thomas, with whom I started this presentation. I still work with Thomas. His needs are complex due to number of factors, one of which is a disability. I won’t mention, which disability it is, it's a quite rare disability, but I don’t want to identify him too much. And he is... He is now 11 and he is becoming acutely aware of his differentness and he is, he is an unusual little boy because he has a very strong verbal ability and yet he has got lots of difficulties in many many other areas. Firstly, I'd like to tell you this to illustrate a number of points. One just to how diverse the notion of disrupted attachment can be. Secondly, how creative children can be in communicating this to us and how patiently, how patient they can be in allowing us the time to see what they've been trying to communicate for so long. And thirdly, how important it is to trust the process while holding the environment and allowing the attachment within the therapeutic relationship to develop. Thomas' family had to leave their home in Zimbabwe when he was six. They experienced a lot of violence and loss and it was just too risky to remain. They had large cattle property actually it remains in the family, but his uncle manages it, consisting of many different divisions all named. Thomas and his sister have loving parents, who have been very involved in their upbringing. But their mother was also assisted in their upbringing by a number of other people whilst they were in Zimbabwe. People employed on the farm, his nanny housekeeper and of course the cattle boys. Thomas loved the cattle and everything to do with cattle. He had a favorite cattle boy called Solomon. Yeah, I wouldn’t call cattle boyd, they were actually men, but that’s the term that they have given. Now, every year his birthday treat was to have a picnic, which involved first dipping the cattle then having a party, which all the people employed on the property attended and which involved cooking a meal on the campfire and sharing a large cake that mummy had made. Now prior to their leaving, Thomas' nanny Anna died of cancer, which was a huge loss for the family and also his grandmother passed away. When the family were waiting at Johannesburg Airport to catch the plane that would bring them to Australia, Thomas sat looking at the window, his mum told me this story, looking at the window and sort of chanted this very strange good bye ritual where he said over and over and over. The names of all the sections of the farm, good bye my beautiful west maid, good bye my... whatever the name, all these different names on and on. Mum didn’t even know that he knew the names of all of the divisions, and he just sat there and he chanted all of this. Now when I began working with Thomas, I didn't know how it would go because of his particular disability. But he is proved to be someone with whom I felt profoundly humbled. For a very long time all of his sessions took place in the sandbox with as many cattle as he could find in the baskets of animals when they were not enough other animals became cattle. Then he took a little while because he's quite rigid in what he thinks. I’ve been chastised for my poor selection of cattle, which were puny, too slow, too few, had under-sized testicles, which would therefore be no good for breeding. Haha… I’ve had many lessons about what makes the good farming practices and by the way Australian farmers are very bad farmers because they wean the calves too young. I’ve had lessons in dipping and branding and dehorning and castrating and loading and marketing. And there were times when I wondered what the session had been about. There were times when I could see very clear parallels between what was happening in the sandbox and what was happening in Thomas' life, like trying to cope with playing at school and you know various things of that... As time went by and he began to trust me, Thomas might talk directly about certain things, but usually not. Usually always the metaphor of the cattle, the cattle yards, the farm, and whatever. Then came an appointment something changed I knew it, knew something had changed. It was so obvious. I didn’t know the significance too much later in fact it is only probably that last two months or three months. He discovered I had clay and he asked if he could use it. Ah… Of course you can. In the first session with the clay. Now this is a boy who is got major motor problems, okay. He made 20 cattle. They were much better than my pony one developed cattle. Look how big and strong I argued, he'd say. He worked like a man possessed to make those 20 cattle and they took them home. Several sessions later he returned to the idea of making some more cattle out of clay so of course he did. Then every sessions for a quite a number of weeks he used clay not satisfied with one or two pieces he made eight or ten. Well, how could I make a big bull with just that little amount of clay. I’m not getting you box... And Dewlap... This is his Dewlap, these are his testicles this is his horn em... And I didn’t have any idea of what, why this was so important. But then this clay making stopped suddenly. We turned to the sandbox played out for several sessions. The play about a man who took this cattle away and he had to be punished and Thomas articulated I can't begin to tell you the most cruel and terrible ways in which he would be punished. He was very, very angry and I knew this was very important, but I couldn’t make a gel in my head and I said something made some comment one day about what he was doing when absolutely no way. Then I finally said to him; Thomas you seem to be very mad at a man. I wonder who the man is that you’re most mad at? And with, you know I’m not usually that direct but anyway he looked kind of he put his head down and he looked at me with absolute hate in his eyes and he just said Mr. McGabby(ph) and I thought; Oh, God! And then he became overwhelmed, absolutely overwhelmed with sadness and he said these are the actual words. He made me leave my beautiful home, my beautiful, beautiful home and I’m so, so sad. I'll tell you that was so hard to be with. Now, it was... Don’t ask me what prompted me. But when I talked about this with my, my magnificent clinical supervisor, he said it was the attachment my dear. Hahaha… But when I said to Thomas would you like to bring some photographs of your home and he did. He brought some photos and we looked at them and we wrote some things together about them and as I looked through them I became overwhelmed by the magnitude of this boy's loss. The nature of his attachment to his home and all that meant. There was something very spiritual moving between us and never the more so when he showed me the photos of his birthday of him with Solomon. The birthday party, the campfire, him passing birthday cake and the connection as the smiling, it was just magnificent. But then there was the several photos of him with Solomon, cooking dinner, lovely photo. The next one, they're sorting down facing each other. And at first I thought wasn't that a lovely photo and then I looked and here between them they had created a replica of the cattle yards, the dips, out of sticks, then I looked more closely and what do you suppose was on the ground in amongst all of the you know the cattle yards and... Any ideas? Clay cattle, clay cattle, heaps of them, all are made by Solomon for Thomas. And then in the background, there is a stone building, now there were no windows and the window spaces but up on the ledge and my husband saw this and I didn’t notice it, because I so overwhelmed by this other thing. Bill says to me; Look at that. All these big bulls, clay bulls, just almost exactly like the ones Thomas had been making. I don't know about you but I still get goosebumps when I think about it. So, here Thomas had used this therapy to mourn the greatest loss of this attachment with significant people, his country, his home. Does he consider himself an Australian even though his family is naturalized? No, resoundingly not. The attachment has grown between us through the therapeutic relationship has been important in allowing Thomas to approach the task of mourning. When all that time ago, he referred to me as his friend, not an appointment, he communicated with the honesty that only a child can and cut to the essence of therapeutic work. The importance of the nature of the relationship that the therapist has with the patient. Are we finished, we got time to... Can I do one more little bit or we’ve right on time? Oh… I will just finish I had intended to finish with this video if you just. When I taught in schools I puzzled over what was, what it was that made the good teacher or the effective teacher and really the same message resonated. It was the person of the teacher that made the difference. I recall a piece and I wish I could remember who did this research. I think it was quoted in the book Fifteen Thousand Hours by Michael Rutter, but I’m, can't be positive, it's quite elderly anyway whatever and it quoted a source whereby a piece longitudinal research was carried out on the (inaudible ) boys for whom the research is predicted very poor outcomes based on their socioeconomic circumstances. The research has had predicted that this cohort would likely be in the low socioeconomic record as they got older likely have manner of social problems, unemployment, jailed time, drug problems and so on. However, on follow-up into adulthood their predication wasn't upheld and they’ve done very well extraordinarily well. And they began to search, researchers began to search for reasons, common links and eventually discovered that all of the boys had, had one teacher in common, a woman who was still alive then, but very elderly. So they interviewed her to discover the secrets to their success say if you were any and apparently her reply to the researchers was very simple. I love those boys. I way like that story. But people not programs you're people, Bruce Perry comments one of the greatest lessons I have learnt in my work is the importance of taking the time before doing anything else to pay attention and listen. Because of the newer biology of our brain one of the best ways to help someone else become common centered is to common center ourselves first and then just pay attention. One might then Christian what it is that calming and centering oneself showing love as a teacher in the above story did for those boys paying attention or resemble. Of course they resembled the parent-child relationship. The predictable safe holding environment, which enables the child to have a secure experience of him or herself. Where the mother's face mirrors what she sees in the child an environment which engenders the development of secure attachment. Perry comments at heart it is the relationship with the therapist not, not primarily his or her methods or words of wisdom that allows therapy to work. I would like to take that a little further and suggest that at the heart of the therapeutic relationship it is the attachment that allows therapy to work.
