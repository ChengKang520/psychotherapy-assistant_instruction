BART WALSH, MSW 

00:00:35
BART WALSH So my name is Bart Walsh. And this is… uh… this the presentation is about uh… well, a little different way of dealing with substance misuse. And umm… it… I call it Utilization sobriety because it very much utilizes, a person's psychobiological system uh… to get what they need. And we'll get into that we've got a lot to cover here. The umm… and I'll just tell you, I'm from Portland, Oregon. I have a private practice up's there and I also run the Milner Erikson Institute in Portland and… and for the last 13 years I've been uh… contracting some portion of my time to a medical clinic that deals with eating disorders and that's… that's been fascinating work and rewarding work as well. But we're gonna talk about substance use today. And I will be running through the method this utilization sobriety method. I'll also given sufficient time to talk to you about uh… how I'd approach to helping people resolve accumulated emotion. I call that the Goldfinger approach, basically because it does work with ideomotor signaling, the gold finger. And we're going to talk a little bit about gene expression as we addressed some… some folks that are genetically prone to addiction. And we'll have some time to… to deal with that for sure we're also going to talk a bit about umm… the (inaudible) parts model that I use in this work. So we've got a lot to cover and I'd just like to get a sense of… well who everybody here is and please feel free to come up closer if you like, if you're comfortable where you are just fine. But how many folks here do work with ideomotor signaling? Okay, a few of you. Great. All right. And how many folks here do a parts work, ego state work? Okay. Few more, grate. And how many of you regularly work with umm… substance abuse treatment? Okay, great, great. Okay, so I want you to feel very free to ask any questions as we go along and I don't know where the microphones are, but I'll ask you to please talk into the microphone so that we don't have to repeat the question and this is all being recorded. So the using the microphones will be very happy… helpful. Does anybody know where the microphones are? 

00:03:55
UNKNOWN There up there. 

00:03:55
BART WALSH Well, oh, here is one microphone and I think what I'm gonna do is just give that to you, great. So if… if you have a question perhaps you can raise your hands so one of the volunteers can get the microphone to you, or you can approach the volunteer either way. Great. Okay. Now. Welcome, We've been waiting for you. Okay, pardon me. So before we go any further I would like to… I would like to ask each of you to maybe grab a pen and paper if you don't have one out already. And first think about an experience that you had somewhere in the past whether it's a week ago or 20 years ago, it doesn't matter, but I want you to think about an experience that you had a memorable experience that you had with a substance, any substance. It might be alcohol, it could be anything, but let yourself go back and review that experience something memorable, sometime in the past and jot down the best parts of that experience for you, whatever they might be, whether it was some intellectual enhancement, emotional enhancement, some social enhancement, uh… change in perception. It could be anything. But just jot down the best parts of that experience, and we'll get back to that a little bit later. Now… now if by chance you've never had any… any memorable experience with some substance then you could also call up some context, some particular contexts that really made a difference for you that can work fine as well. But just think of whatever positive elements were involved in that experience and jot those down. 

00:06:35
[sil.] 

00:06:45
BART WALSH And you can add to that list as we go along, but I'm gonna move on a little bit. 

00:06:55
[sil.] 

00:07:00
BART WALSH And I did want to tell you also that umm… the utilization sobriety book is in the bookstore here. It's also available through Amazon either as a paperback or an e-book coarsely books a lot cheaper. And there's another book that has some of the elements are actually quite a few of the elements that we'll be covering today in great detail. Emotional regulation using signals of self, and that just umm… got put on eBook format. So you… you have both of those available to you the… the emotional regulation book gets a lot more into epigenetic modification or turning genes off. And that umm… well that's a lot of fun. So now I'd like to review the hypothesis that… that got me going with utilization sobriety because many years ago when I was attempting to do substance abuse treatment with folks it was extremely frustrating, and it was difficult to see folks struggling with abstinence when this substance was really addressing some important need that they had. They couldn't really take care of that need and… and it was… it was tough. So consider that if a person can move from an external locus of dependence to an internal position of control and self-reliance, and if a person likewise moves from a sense of helplessness toward autonomy, and an awareness of personal power. And if treatment is integrative, really integrative and considers the whole person not just a symptom, and if psychobiological needs are acknowledged and respected, and if the client's own system or process is utilized, and if a new cognitive framework is added which bypasses shame and perceived resistance, then substance-use will not be emotionally driven or part of a cognitive perceptual network sustaining prior beliefs and learning about self and the world. Substance use thus becomes redundant maladaptive choice, no longer a need or mechanism for satisfying a need. This make any sense to you all? 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:09:50
BART WALSH It… it made a lot of sense to me and it spurred me on to develop this… this particular method. Now consider what's happening when someone uses a substance, what's really going on? Now there's… there's often some need that's being addressed, but consider the physiological dynamics that are going on. Now this chart I'm showing you is not a complete exhaustive chart, but it's got a lot of substances that are commonly used. And consider how the substance commandeers some natural substance that's already in the body and gets into a receptor site that that natural substance, typically fills. So cocaine for instance commandeers dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine, and… and implants itself in the dopamine. Receptor site, we go down the marijuana. And there's a natural substance called anandamide that gets produced in high quantities when we go to sleep. Now anandamide has a lot of the same qualities that THC, tetrahydrocannabinol the active ingredient in marijuana has, it relaxes us. And ananadamide helps with pain management. And umm… an interesting common feature was THC is that it causes short-term memory loss. And umm… so it's very much like THC, but it gets commandeered by marijuana. So now you all have all of these slides in your… uh… your handouts and plus you have a copy of the Goldfinger article in case we don't have time to get all the way through that. Now as most of you know communication is taking place all the time, interpersonal communication is taking place whether people are talking or not. There's body language, there's posture, there's all kinds of communication taking place when two people are together. And there's lots and lots of communication taking place within our system all the time. And the beautiful thing is that the unconscious has access to all that communication and functioning within us. The unconscious has access to some of the very deepest levels of functioning right down to the molecular and up to the psychological. Within us and I'm not gonna spend a lot of time on all this physiological communication, but umm… you'll have the handouts and can… can go through some of this but this just illustrates how these communications substances like peptides and uh… Well all kinds of things are happening within us that networking with this communication is quite extensive. 

00:13:30
[sil.] 

00:13:35
BART WALSH And trance phenomena is just a way to see how some of this communication is really working at a very deep level because as most of you know trance is… is when the unconscious plays a dominant role and our experience. I like to think of it like a couple of people going for a drive in our waking state, most of the time the conscious mind has the steering wheel and the unconscious is in the passenger seat work on the laptop computer getting all kinds of things done, in a trance state or a sleep state the unconscious mind has the steering wheel and the conscious mind may be in the passenger seat observing what's going on or maybe asleep in the backseat or it may go back and forth between those two positions and it doesn't matter so much. But consider trance phenomenon as a way to observe, how the unconscious is really accessing so very, very deep levels of functioning because memory functions can be influenced, time distortion can take place and the association of any of the senses uh… any part of our experience can occur. And our perceptions can be greatly modified. And I'm just rushing through some of this, but I especially like to think about the functions of the insulation and the hypothalamus because these are modulating parts of our brain that are connected to most of the rest of the brain and when you look at the functions of the insulin the hypothalamus, you can see how… how powerfully unconscious work might benefit, any of us? Okay. Now what I'd like to do is a little exercise and for those of you who came in late I'll just tell you that earlier I asked everybody to think of some memorable experience they had with a substance, any substance. And to… to jot down the best parts of that experience what it did for you. How it benefited you, what you liked about it? And so I just want to get you up to speed on that. And for those of you who have not developed ideomotor finger signals at this point, we can do that because we're gonna have a well a bit of fun. At least I think it'll be a bit of fun for you. And you can develop fingers signals such that one finger lifts up as a yes, signal from the unconscious a different signal let perform different finger lifts up as a no signal from the unconscious. And this way we can pose questions to the unconscious and get direct answers, this also gives you a tool that you can use anytime you'd like to access unconscious resources, and this is a tool that I use frequently. I can tell you that not long ago I was blowing my nose and I developed a nosebleed and I click through my head back and asked my unconscious if it would please construct that blood vessel and my left nostril stop the bleeding and my yes finger lifted up and then I asked the finger to lift up again when the bleeding was stopped and the whole thing was over and less than a minute. So it's nice to be able to have access to those resources whenever you need them. Okay, so what I'm going to ask you to do is rest your hands in a position that allows your fingers to have free movement, no obstruction and it's nice that we have tables here because that… that might be a nice way for you to be able to see your finger movements just resting your hands on it… on the table. And some people prefer to have their… their hands palms up when they do this, others palms down and it just whatever's comfortable for you. The important thing is that those fingers not be obstructed in any way. And all the fingers have equal merit so it doesn't matter which one lifts up I can't tell you how many times clients have apologized for flipping me off when they're middle finger goes up. But anyway they all have equal merit. So what I want you to do is first give your unconscious mind permission to develop these yes-no finger signals. And that's just a matter of sending that message in word. And then let yourself think of something very positive, it could be anything at all. Place you like to be some activity, you enjoy favorite food always does it for me, but anything that's positive for you just let yourself focus on that positive something and as you do that one of those fingers will lift up all by itself is a very clear yes signal from the unconscious. 'Cause thinking and feeling yes, yes, yes. And the unconscious has all the time necessary to developed this yes signal lifting up a finger. So that when… when the unconscious determines which finger is appropriate for yes signal that finger will just float up very easily, all by itself. So just enjoy that positive focus has all of this happens. And realize that this is quite idiosyncratic. It's a little different for everybody. Some people notice a distinct sensation in a finger, even before it lifts up and others notice nothing at all is a finger floats up like a helium balloon was attached to it, just a little different for everybody. That right. And of course some of you, if you're feeling nothing may want to open your eyes to just see if there's a finger already elevated, I'm seeing a lot of fingers elevated at this point. 

00:20:50
[sil.] 

00:20:55
BART WALSH For some of you your finger may twitch or vibrate instead of lifting up, just there's different ways of doing it. All right. Wonderful. And as I see that there's a lot of finger movement will say. I wanna thank the unconscious for being so responsive I certainly appreciate that. And… 

00:21:35
[sil.] 

00:21:40
BART WALSH I'm assuming that most of you have experience some… some development of that yes signal with a finger. And so now we can find out which other finger on that same hand is going to lift up as a no signal from the unconscious. So let yourself think of something that represents no might have been the alarm going off this morning. It could be anything at all, just thinking and feeling no, no, no, as a different finger on that same hand lifts up to signal no. And if you have any difficulty thinking of something that represents no, you can always just imagine seeing the word NO in big bold letters that'll work fine as well. And when the unconscious determines which fingers appropriate for know that finger will just lift up all by itself. 

00:22:55
[sil.] 

00:23:15
BART WALSH Great. That's right. Things just happening quite automatically. 

00:23:25
[sil.] 

00:23:30
BART WALSH And of course if your eyes are closed you might wanna open them just to… just to see what fingers lifted up, to see what's happening. Some of you will feel it and some of you won't. Great. 

00:23:55
[sil.] 

00:24:00
BART WALSH All right. 

00:24:05
[sil.] 

00:24:15
BART WALSH And for those of you who's NO finger is taking a little more time to develop realize this all can happen and sometimes it requires a particular contexts, but now what I would like to do is ask you unconscious a few questions. And I'll ask the unconscious to please respond to my questions through those fingers. So please remember which is your yes and which is your no fingers. And I'm gonna ask the unconscious since… since it knows all about that… that memorable substance experience you thought about earlier and even took some… some notes on. Your unconscious knows about the best parts of that substance experience. And so I'm going to ask your unconscious will it be all right since… since the body records everything that goes into it. It knows about substances, it knows about medications, it knows about food and liquid, and air, and it just records all that information and keeps it in a biological library and the unconscious has a library card to get into that. So I'm going to ask the unconscious. Will it be all right to develop that particular substance experienced, just the best parts of that substance experience that are memorable to you. Will it be all right to develop that substance experience at this time, so you can benefit from it without actually using any substance? And one of those fingers can respond to my question. 

00:26:25
[sil.] 

00:26:35
BART WALSH And if you're getting it, yes, just let yourself enjoy and I'm gonna ask you with your non signaling hand, with the hand that does not have those fingers signals on it, please touch the thumb and index finger first finger together on that hand and let those two fingers continued touching for a little while, and just enjoy this experience and when the unconscious recognizes that you really are experiencing the best parts of this substance experience that yes finger can lift up at that time. 

00:27:20
[sil.] 

00:27:35
BART WALSH That's right, please let yourself enjoy. 

00:27:40
[sil.] 

00:27:45
BART WALSH The best parts of that experience in just the right way and realize it because we're asking for the best of that experience it may be a little different than the actual experience because it doesn't have any of the downside. Okay. And as this experience perhaps deepens or intensifies even more, I'm going to ask the unconscious, will it be all right for you to access this same or even more intense substance experience whenever you desire it? Simply by touching those two fingers together as they are now and requesting that experience, so that whenever it's important for you to have the same or even more intense substance experience you really will be able to call it up, just by touching those fingers together and saying something like, "I'd like that substance experienced now, please." Will it be all right for you to have access to that experience through the signaling system that I just described? And one of those fingers can lift up to respond to that question. 

00:29:10
[sil.] 

00:29:20
BART WALSH And if you got a yes response that means that you can now access that experience anytime any place, you now have what I call a benefit state tool. And realize that you can change the name of that tool to whatever you like. Because umm… for instance when I work with someone who is wanting to step away from heroin, they may not want to have a heroine tool or call it a heroin tool, so I encourage them to come up with a name that works for them. Most recently there was a woman I worked with who was stepping away from heroin and she just decided to call her heroin tool, the black tool. And so when she put her fingers together, she said, I like that black experience now. And umm… that seemed to work fine for her. And it was another woman I worked with, it was cocaine and she just called her tool George. And so anyway you can name the tool anything you like, it's just a matter of getting the okay from the unconscious to change that name using those ideomotor signals. Okay, and so you can open your eyes and be as present as possible now. And again if there are any questions please feel free to dive in at any time. All right. 

00:31:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible) questions. 

00:31:05
BART WALSH We have a question. Yes. 

00:31:10
[sil.] 

00:31:15
UNKNOWN Uh… For the yes and no signal do you have to use the same hand? 

00:31:20
BART WALSH Well, I prefer to use the same handed does not have to be that way and for some people it won't be that way. Uh… So the reason I like to have one hand is because if I'm questioning the unconscious for lots of other reasons it's much easier to focus my attention on one hand then be looking back and forth at two different hands. And… 

00:31:40
UNKNOWN And the reason that you use the two fingers after is it what is it? 

00:31:45
BART WALSH That is a physical signal. I like to have a physical component to the tool. And so touching the fingers together and requesting the substance experience is just a way to combine the… the intellectual with the physical. 

00:32:05
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:32:10
UNKNOWN Uh… What… what if you… you told us to imagine something very pleasurable and what if fingers went up on both hands… 

00:32:20
BART WALSH Oh, that's… that's a common theme too. As far as ideomotor signaling is concerned, many people have parallel uh… signals on both hands. So if the index finger lifts up on one hand and lifts up on the other hand there they're both, you know, either yes or no depending on what's designated. So that can happen sometimes people get two fingers lifting up uh… there's… there's a woman I worked with that for her yes, instead of her finger lifting up, her whole hand, arm lifted up. But a no signal was just her pinky finger. Her arm didn't lift up for, but for yes every time it was like that. So it's idiosyncratic and you have to work with whatever happens. Now I can tell you that umm… some years ago there was uh… a fellow came in and he wanted to quit smoking, and use hypnosis to do that and uh… well I found out early on that he had just retired from military intelligence and so I said you probably think you can't possibly be hypnotized and he said, Yeah. But I've tried everything else to quit smoking and nothing's work and so I might as well give this a try. And… and I told him, I said, Well, we're gonna have to do things a little bit differently and… and I told him that uh… that I like to develop some uh… signaling system with the unconscious through fingers and that we can attempt to do that first and see what happens and… and so as I expected the fingers did not move, but his eyebrows moved. Right eyebrow lifting up was yes, left eyebrow was no. So I got signaling system and then I told him that because he had so much secret confidential information that had to be absolutely secure I told him it was absolutely essential that he kept his eyes on me the whole time. And so… so he did a very nice open I trans and went pretty deeply, but uh… anyway as far as the signals are concerned it can be all sorts of things. There was a woman who had a landscaping business that came in during the summer wearing sandals without socks and her fingers, didn't budge, but her right big toe was yes, her left big toe was no. And so I thank the unconscious for at least giving me a signaling system and I continued working with her into the winter and at that time I… I asked her unconscious if it would please transfer those signals to the fingers because she had to wear her boots and socks and I wouldn't be able to see the signals, so the unconscious did transfer to finger signals. So there's all kinds of possible variations with the signaling system, it's just a matter of observing. Okay. Other questions? Yes. 

00:35:35
UNKNOWN Yes, I added a definite yes and no. But then if… if it was okay to use that pleasurable experience and to call on it nothing happened. 

00:35:50
BART WALSH Okay. 

00:35:55
UNKNOWN So the thing that I make of that is that it really my unconscious is saying it's not okay. 

00:36:00
BART WALSH Yeah. 

00:36:05
UNKNOWN Because there was… there were too many dangerous things in that experiences as well. 

00:36:10
BART WALSH Now this is… that's a very good point and this does happen and sometimes the unconscious needs to be reminded that calling up this experience now is healthy and natural, and there's absolutely no substance and none of the danger involved in the substance use. just a reminder sometimes that and other times there are a lot of emotional experiences tied in with that previous substance use that need to be resolved. Okay? More than once people I've worked with the unconscious as refused to let them have that substance tool that benefit state tool uh… because of guilt. And so we had to resolve that guilt and once we did that then A-okay. 

00:37:10
UNKNOWN It fits. 

00:37:10
BART WALSH Okay. So we'll get into the emotional stuff later and now this is uh… another question. Yes. 

00:37:20
UNKNOWN I'll be really quick. Umm… Just because I was writing, did you say, when you're asking the unconscious because I was writing you with the other hand it's your thumb finger and this finger that you're asking yeah. And also if you have a client that doesn't want to close their eyes, does out lenient the (inaudible). 

00:37:40
BART WALSH Oh, it doesn't make any difference. 

00:37:40
UNKNOWN It doesn't make any difference. 

00:37:40
BART WALSH Doesn't make. 

00:37:45
UNKNOWN Finally where did she say the article is, beside that was written up there… there's nears at forgive me… 

00:37:50
BART WALSH Yeah. There… umm… there's a… there's a… a journal article on this but actually I've got a handful of copies here I can pass out of that, but there's also a book utilization sobriety book in the bookstore or online through Amazon, there's a Kindle copy. So… Yeah. Okay. Now these are just instructions for developing the ideomotor signals, but you all… already know how to do it. And it… it what will happen with most people, but it may not always happen in the way that you're expecting as I just referenced it can be other parts of the body that deliver the signal besides the fingers. Okay. So you've got that in the handout and… Now these are guidelines for… for doing ideomotor questioning and I could spend the rest of the time here talking about the guidelines but I'm not gonna do that, but I very much encourage all of you to read through these guidelines they're important. And umm… it's basic stuff that you would do with any kind of hypnotic work. And this is the method and so initially… initially I like to first of course develop some rapport with the person I'm working with and then I like to get some history some… some of the substance use history and learn about what their current life is like, what their substance use is like at this time. And this is a very important point that is not on the slides when you're doing this work well here's what I do if I get a call and I know that somebody is wanting to do some work on substance use. I tell them that we can schedule an appointment, but it's extremely important that they not use his substance for 24 hours before our appointment. And I let them know that things can work beautifully if they do that, and that if they don't follow through with that the session may be a failure. So that means and I tell them I said you're going to feel lousy when you come in here you're gonna feel a lot better when you leave. So uh… this has to do with the physiological effects of this method. If a person has the substance actively in them already that means receptor sites are filled up okay? And that means that the natural substances that can recreate the substance experience are gonna work. So, we're serious substances are involved whether it's opioids or alcohol, uh… it's important that the person be stepping in to withdraw. When they come into the office and that's the best time. Another question back here no microphone back there. 

00:41:30
UNKNOWN I just gonna ask you, if… how that works with suboxone, do you have suboxone clients? 

00:41:35
BART WALSH Yeah. Yeah. It… this can work fine. 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:41:40
BART WALSH Yeah. 

00:41:40
UNKNOWN So they don't have to not use suboxone that day or should they? 

00:41:45
BART WALSH Well, no, no they should… they should not use suboxone. 

00:41:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:41:45
BART WALSH Okay? 

00:41:50
UNKNOWN Same 24-hour. 

00:41:50
BART WALSH Yeah, it's the same thing. Umm… Now for some… sometimes 12 hours will be adequate. All right? But I know or pain relief is concerned this approach can be applied to any substance. Okay? And there are people that don't want to take pain killers just because they're afraid of getting addicted to them and so I asked them about pain killers in the past what worked for you? And they'll tell me what the substance was and boom will call up that substance. And so it can work for… for anything, but always best to… to have the substance out of their system or not actively in their system. 

00:42:35
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:42:35
BART WALSH Great. Okay. Okay. So I get some information about… about the substance use as persons experiencing and then… then I will ask them about the best parts of substance use. Now anybody that's been through substance treatment already, typically tells me there's nothing good about it, it's… it's ruining my life, it costs me a marriage, it blah, blah, blah, blah. And then I'll say, well, just go back a ways what… what got you using this substance in the first place? Think back to when you really were actively involved in it and… and enjoying it to some degree. So it takes a little persistence to get those umm… benefits, so substance benefits from a person but it's very important that they tap into that. And sometimes there may be just one or two or three benefits that they can identify that's okay, if that's what works for them. And so then… then I'll… I'll ask the person if you could get these benefits without using the substance, would you like that? Now almost always that gets laughter. They say, okay, what drugs are you talking about? And I'll say, No, there's no drug just hypothetically if you could get this experience, this the best parts of the substance experience without using, would you like that? Well, it's almost always a yes. And then I tell them about the… the learning that the body has as I mentioned earlier. How the body records everything that goes into it and… and I think of it as the body having a biological library and the unconscious having a library card and tell them that it umm… it might be worth us exploring this possibility by checking in with your unconscious and I tell them that there's a real simple way we can develop a signaling system with your unconscious and ask some questions. So I kind of outline ideomotor signaling and… and most of the time people go for that. We developed those signals and… and then… well, then call up the experience, and I… I'll you this… there's one… one experience that I will never forget, this happened years ago. And this fellow had called my office in the morning and he said he absolutely needed… needed some help or he was going to use heroin again. And he was trying his best to… to quit, but it just wasn't working and he was just in misery and they needed some help and while I had a full day scheduled, uh… but this guy was in bad shape. And so I… I told them I said, Well, you do exactly as I say? I'm willing to help you, but you're gonna have to do exactly what I say. And he said, yeah. And I said, Okay, I want you to pack some food and… and I want you to pack some… something to keep you occupied whether it's a book or some game or something. Bring it with you come to my office and sit in the lobby, until I can see you. He did, he showed up, he looked horrible, but he stayed in that lobby until I was done with my last client and he came in and umm… anyway we went through this procedure and he… his unconscious agreed to call up the best of heroin and he was kinda hunched over in his seat like this and really looking miserable and… and umm… after his unconscious agreed to develop that heroin tool or hell heroin experience uh… he slowly setup right his coloration is to hit changed, he opened his eyes, he looked at me and… and he said, Bart, this is good shit. I will never forget that. And so… umm… so I encouraged him to… to use that tool, his heroin tool once an hour and I told him that if he does that he will not experience any more withdrawal symptoms. And this is an important point and this is where the physiology comes in. And I've seen this with lots of different substances. If the tool is use a person can step away from any substance quickly without withdrawal symptoms. And this… this goes for alcohol, and ODTs, heroin, whatever the substance is, but they have to use their tool. And so this guy umm… canceled his second appointment because he had worked conflict and umm… I follow it up with him a year later and he uh… when I first got him on the phone he was apologetic about not using his tool very often and I said That's okay why not and he says, well, I just haven't needed it and he said, he said, he hadn't done any heroin over that year since that first appointment and he was doing great. So now here's another thing that I don't have on the slides that you can do. It's a nice convenience for any substance is once the person has the substance tool, once it's engaged, I asked them to close their eyes and imagine seeing a timer and it could be any kind of timer and ask them to let me know when they have a clear picture that timer. And when they do that they say, okay, this timer is gonna be attached to your substance tool. So that you can set the timer whenever you use this tool for however long you want to maintain the experience. So you can set it for a half hour or an hour or three hours whatever. And when the timer runs out if you want more you just use the tool again and reset the timer. So this… this was a result of a woman that… uh… that… that came in her thing was alcohol and she came back for her… her second appointment and umm… uh… I said, how things going? She goes crappy. And I go, what… what… what's wrong? Did you use your tool? Yeah. And I said, What's crappy? That tool only last 15 minutes. Oh, okay. And did you use it again after 15 minutes? Why would I do that? I take a drug or something that lasts longer than 15 minutes? Anyway. So that's when I started doing the timer and once… once she had the timer she was… she was a happy camper. So anyway just something… something you can do. 

00:50:15
UNKNOWN We have a question. 

00:50:20
UNKNOWN Can you repeat that one more time just apart how… 

00:50:25
BART WALSH What… what's that? 

00:50:25
UNKNOWN You said the substance tool and can you repeat it because I got part of it, not all of it. 

00:50:30
BART WALSH Oh, okay. 

00:50:30
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

00:50:35
BART WALSH Yeah, the benefit state tool the term that I used umm… and… and so uh… as far as developing the tool or… 

00:50:45
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:50:45
BART WALSH Oh, okay, yeah. Okay, so… so once the person is experiencing that… umm… that benefit state, let's say. Uh… I asked them to put two fingers together. Now it… it… it doesn't have to be these two fingers, it could be a closed fist, it could be touching the ear lobe, it… it could be any physical signal, okay? I just liked the fingers because they're easy, okay? And then once… once that happening then I ask the unconscious will it be alright for you to access this same or more intense substance experience whenever you desire it? Simply by touching those fingers together and requesting the substance experience, touching the fingers together and sand I'd like that substance experienced now please. Okay? As I got it? Okay. Great. 

00:51:45
UNKNOWN One more question. 

00:51:45
BART WALSH Yes. 

00:51:50
UNKNOWN How might you treat intense craving say some of the clients I work with an early sobriety might say, you know, I don't wanna… I'm… I'm feeling really strong craving right now. 

00:52:05
BART WALSH Okay. Good question. And what you can do with cravings, this we're gonna get into a deeper level of that shortly, but uh… what would I like to do before the person leaves the office, I will just using ideomotor questioning, I'll ask the unconscious. Will adjustments now be made to free the body of any craving for this particular substance, to free the entire system of any craving for this substance? And typically I get a yes. If I get it, No, I'll ask is there something important that needs to be clearly understood by way of making this adjustment to be free of the craving? And I'll usually get a yes to that. And then I'll ask, okay, will this important information become very clear as this adjustment is made? And usually get a yes to that. And then I'll have… I'll ask the yes finger to lift up when the entire system is free of any craving for the substance. 

00:53:25
[sil.] 

00:53:30
BART WALSH Okay. Another question. Yes. 

00:53:30
UNKNOWN I have one… One more question. You mentioned the body which makes sense has to be clear this is of the… drug with cocaine and alcohol, what's the best length of time for the client before they come into your office? 

00:53:45
BART WALSH Well, 24 hours is best. Okay? But there had been a number of times I've… I've allowed 12 hours with alcohol. Just because people do start going into the details some people pretty quickly. And umm… so umm… and for some that's the longest they can let themselves go, 12 hours can work 24 hours is best. Yes. 

00:54:15
UNKNOWN I'm recovering and I've taught myself to not allow cravings to, you know, hang with me at all push him out of out of sight out of mind as quick as possible, I had a really difficult time, I couldn't give myself permission to experience that, how do you get around that is terrifying and meeting get caught up in that… 

00:54:40
BART WALSH Okay. This is where you can re language some of it, okay? Such that sometimes I will tell a person, okay, what you experience with the substance? Uh… You likely consider only attributing to the substance, but it's a natural process that you can experience without the substance. And will it be all right to call up that natural substance that… that brings on this particular feeling that allows (inaudible) my perception to shift in a certain way. And you can go on with all the benefits, okay? Without attributing those benefits to the substance and umm… and ask the unconscious if that's okay. And also you can remind the unconscious that you have no intention of using that substance again, uh… but there are benefits that can be experienced, that could be very helpful today, uh… day in day out that you'd like to have, uh… by developing a tool. So that's… that's one way that you can get to it. Is that makes sense? Yeah. So it's… it's re-language things. 

00:56:05
UNKNOWN You can also just associated to something pleasurable in your life that you enjoy like for myself, I did my Chai/tea in the morning. 

00:56:15
BART WALSH Okay. 

00:56:15
UNKNOWN That suppose to alcohol or drugs. 

00:56:20
BART WALSH Great… great. 

00:56:20
UNKNOWN We also had a question over here. 

00:56:25
BART WALSH Okay. 

00:56:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. In… in this case umm… it sounds like we umm… you're not necessarily filling the whole of the thing that's missing sometimes you evoke the experience to sort of not necessarily substitute for something, but to more maybe accompany it have a different positive experience that way, is that right? 

00:56:50
BART WALSH Sure. 

00:56:50
UNKNOWN Yeah. Right the quest the question I had was umm… around the craving issue if you get a no is there anything that needs to be understood to make this adjustment, then will that become clear and then there was one more thing I can't remember what you said after that. 

00:57:05
BART WALSH Well, so… so then if… if… if… if …if yes there is information that's needed uh… before you can umm… take care of the craving. Uh… Then I will ask will that important information become very clear as the adjustment to resolve the craving takes place. 

00:57:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:57:25
BART WALSH So that's just making it one step instead of two, you… you can also just ask, okay, well, that important information come to conscious awareness now? And umm… and then ask for the craving to be resolved, but I… I just kind of sometimes smash it into one step instead of two. 

00:57:45
UNKNOWN Right. So will it become clear you get a yes most likely? And then umm… you just sort of… it just… it just evolves from there… you sound like you're much to do at (inaudible). 

00:58:00
BART WALSH Sometimes when I've asked that question, I've there's been a long delay where I don't get a yes or no and I explained to the unconscious, okay, this is a big giant request and it's probably something that she'd never done before, but I know how capable the unconscious is of making these physiological adjustments. So uh… we'll let happen please. So I kind of push it along a little. Okay. Okay. Yes. 

00:58:30
UNKNOWN I was wondering if it's sometime you would demonstrate this with somebody, uh… so that we could get a log down a little bit better as concerned. 

00:58:45
BART WALSH Yeah, yeah. The question was about having a demonstration. Yeah, okay. And I would… I would love to do a demonstration, unfortunately today if we're gonna cover especially the material about addiction, uh… we're not gonna have time uh… I… I… I loved doing demonstrations and… and if we had a little more time we definitely could. Umm… Okay. Yes. 

00:59:15
UNKNOWN (inaudible), Bart can you hear me? 

00:59:20
BART WALSH That microphone doesn't seem to be working. 

00:59:25
UNKNOWN Okay. Let me, let me just, I can talk loud enough. 

00:59:25
BART WALSH Yeah. 

00:59:25
UNKNOWN Hello. 

00:59:30
BART WALSH It work. 

00:59:30
UNKNOWN Okay, great, thank you. I love these volunteers. Umm… what if a person comes in and they go through this… this is remarkable what you're talking about. I think it's really remarkable what you do and what you've established here for us. I wondered about a person who comes in who say the person drinks because it gives him courage, he gives them strength to go out on the dance floor or a drink because my job is so stressful or a drink because I'm miserable in my relationship with my wife or my husband. I mean, is in… I think some I talk about is there what… what do you do with that whole, that vacuum, that the alcohol filled is I'm wondering is there a ripple effect once they can touch on the positive effects of not using our the positive effects they hear one using and there's a whole establish is that when the unconscious comes in with the wisdom of the unconscious and helps them cope with the stressors that created the problem. 

01:00:35
BART WALSH That… that can and does often happen and this is a first step to stepping away from the alcohol, okay? And it… now there was a… oh, there was a high-powered businessman who came in one time and it was… it was like you were saying, you know, he drinks because it's the only way he can kinda just chill out, just real intense work every day and he's fried when he comes home and he has to do something. Well, when I asked him about the… the… the benefits of drinking, he… he said, well after a certain amount of drinks I get this kinda tingling in my body, you know, and I just sort of chill out and I don't care about anything. And so when he developed his alcohol tool guess what happened? He got that… that tingling effect and he started nodding out, and he got exactly what he got from the alcohol. So he started using that in it for him at work. Now there was more to do about how to manage stress at work and how to deal with lots of other things, But umm… so often you can just trust a person's unconscious to come up with something that's gonna work for them. 

01:01:55
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:01:55
BART WALSH Sure. Okay. Now once all of this happens, if a person seriously wants to step away from that substance, I tell them that it's gonna be a little awkward to start with and that it's very important that they make whatever adjustments they need to make to… to really maintain freedom from the substance, but one step that's important to take is writing a goodbye letter to their relationship with the substance. And that umm… I've got some… just some, while a format for writing that goodbye letter because I want them to say everything just as if it were a relationship where the person, they're choosing to end it. And so there's the good and the bad and the ugly and just everything. And writing that letter can really be a powerful step for most people. So there was one fellow that umm… oh, gosh, he did this 20 years ago and he still has in his office he owns his own business, but he still has his goodbye letter framed in his office. And he's been… he's been straight since so. Okay. Now that's the goldfinger we're gonna jump ahead a little bit and try to get back to Goldfinger. Now I want to say a little something, some of you do parts work and for those of you that don't it's important to… to realize that we are all well kind of multiple personalities and that we have many, many parts inside and consider an infant, starting life out everything is new, there's just a tremendous amount of information that an infant is exposed to and it's quite overwhelming. So the human system creates these parts or ego states to handle specific chunks of information. And so by the time we reach adulthood we've got hundreds of these parts in us holding specific chunks of information or learning I know in May there's some parts that are nothing, but tying shoe laces. Okay, there's other parts that are about riding a bicycle, other parts are about the alphabet, other parts are about math and so forth. And lots and lots of parts inside doing different things and in a healthy individual these parts have rather fluid communication among themselves and they're ready to… to go when well when it's their time. So… so lots of parts we can interact with these parts through the unconscious we can interact with individual parts or groups of parts. And parts also play a role, quite often in chronic illnesses. And parts are often the workforce of chronic illnesses and these parts are typically isolated from the rest of the system. And when… when any of us has a really big powerful emotional experience that might overwhelm the whole system, our system creates parts and gives the experience with all of the emotional content or as much as can be to these parts and then puts the parts in isolation to insulate the system from the experience. So those of us who are not very emotionally expressive usually have lots and lots of these isolated parts. And well, I'm one of those people who did not grow up emotionally expressive, did not have really an avenue for dealing with my emotions and so I created many, many isolated parts and at a time in my life when I discovered what was going on because I was wanting to get to the source of chronic anxiety when it would come up and it was isolated parts and then from chronic depression and it was isolated parts, and all this stuff. And so finally I asked my unconscious, okay, will the unconscious be willing to gather up these isolated parts, release the emotion that they're carrying, reposition their thoughts and perceptions to the past which is what I do when I'm doing the work directly and then get them out of isolation, so they can integrate with the rest of the system and do something good. My unconscious agreed to do that and began that process and I kept checking in with the unconscious it… it started doing it in a chronological fashion and starting from early age and working on up and so I kept checking how old parts were and when I got up to ten years old that was just delightful, that's a breakthrough, 15 was great 20 was great. Well, it took a full year before I had integrated all of the isolated parts within me. So there were many, many, many. But this can happen for any of us. Okay. So this is parts, okay? Now I want you to consider that for many people genes play a critical role in their substance use. And we know that addiction does run in families and it may not be the same kind of addiction. Some family member may be addicted to gambling, while others in their family history or addicted to a substance, but there are addictive genes that are kind of guiding that experience and so when I'm doing this work with someone after we developed that benefit state tool I will ask the unconscious, is there a force deep with him responsible for creating a need to use this substance repeatedly or to go through those behaviors over and over again repeatedly? Is there some force deep within that's responsible for this… this habitual substance use or habitual behavior? And if… if I get a no, I'm… I'm relieved actually, if I get a yes, then I'll tell the unconscious I'm gonna call this force, the addictive force is that seems an appropriate term for it. And I'd like to ask, are there any parts contributing to this addictive force? And if I get a yes then I'll determine the exact number of parts. So I'll say either more than two parts contributing to the addictive force? Yes. Are there more than four parts contributing to the addictive force? I go on like that until I come up with an exact number and I pray for lone numbers because I've… I've gotten up to 150 at times. So anyway that takes a lot of time. So, okay. So then… then I will… I've learned that any part working for an addictive force is going to be anxious, it just comes with the territory. So before asked these parts to do anything I want them to be free of anxiety. So I'll ask the unconscious, will the anxiety that these parts are carrying now be resolved? And if I get a yes then I'll ask yes finger to lift up when the parts are free of anxiety. When I get that signal then I will say I want to talk to these parts because I got some important information I think they'll appreciate knowing about, and I'll tell the parts this addictive force you've been working for is soon going to become inactive and when that happens you won't have anything to do, you won't have any way to direct your energy or attention. Now this is going to create more anxiety for these parts because parts needs something to do always. So then I say the good news is that there is another job available and it's a job that's good for the whole system. So then I describe a job that's gonna benefit the person I'm working with. Now there's one that I commonly use umm… how loud just spell it out here I'll say OK this new job is an information processing job it processes new information coming into the system in such a way that that new information is easily accessible, easily available. It's like having an extra memory. And that's a great benefit for the whole system. And I tell the parts that this is a very challenging job because they will have to organize and categorize that new information in just the right way to make it accessible, but it's a very satisfying job because I get to see the results of their work very quickly. Would you like to take this important information processing job, okay? Typically the yes finger lifts up and then I tell them, okay, you can start this job now and I'll be checking in the future to see how the job is going see if you need anything. And then I wait a minute and then I will say to the unconscious when these parts have all moved on to that information processing job will this addictive force then be turned off? And typically I'll get a yes, and then I'll ask for the sphincter to lift up when the addictive force is turned off? Okay. So that's the process and that's a big deal because that shuts down the energy that at different levels is driving the addiction. And… but because these are experience-dependent genes they're gonna get turned on again. And so I tell the person that I'm gonna give them some instructions, so that they can take charge of that addictive force and I tell them how important it is to check once a day on the status of the addictive force and… and so I think… Yeah. These are this is the instruction sheet I give actually I've just got some of these here, but umm… let's see there's a couple of things here there's a copy of the utilization sobriety article and then just a copy of those instructions sheets and somebody you'll be able to get those, but you have him on this handout anyway. And so I go over these instructions with the person to make sure that is very clear and then the important thing is really having them follow through with the practice? Okay. Now this… this process, the same process that I use for turning off the addictive force can be used for lots and lots of chronic illnesses. And chronic conditions, and it's… it's… it… it means that you can have a significant influence on gene expression as… as I see it. 

01:15:05
[sil.] 

01:15:10
BART WALSH Okay. Now this is a list of jobs uh… just some that there's really no limit to what jobs you can create, I… I do a lot of work with students and quite often students want help with particular subjects and there was 117 year old that I say What's your toughest subjects? She said, math. And so she developed a math team with the parts. And umm… and then she… she was a person who had lots and lots of parts. And so she ended up with six different teams. Uh… There was math, there was Spanish, there was science, there was any way she went from a C student to an A student uh… with the help of these parts and so… So anyway you can always ask a person if there's something particular that they would like help with and… and then develop a new job for that. Okay. So now… 

01:16:15
[sil.] 

01:16:20
UNKNOWN You have time for question? 

01:16:20
BART WALSH Yes. 

01:16:20
UNKNOWN If you've had a synonym for information processing to give to the client if that didn't work that well either word might you use. 

01:16:35
BART WALSH Well for we… we could call it the memory team job, okay? So, yeah, any of the language can work. 

01:16:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. This is such a critical point around umm… dealing with the pain of letting go of umm… the addiction. Umm… I… The question I have is umm… you have the apart that's been exiled or had been isolated that's bearing a lot of uh… pain shame whatever it is… is it that part that's doing the new job? 

01:17:05
BART WALSH Though the part that's doing the new jobs that part that was working for the addictive force. These are parts that are created by the addictive force… 

01:17:15
UNKNOWN I see. 

01:17:15
BART WALSH …To be the workforce, okay? So usually they're experiencing anxiety that… sometimes there's other emotions if let's say parts will say offer the new job after I clear the anxiety for these parts, okay? And they refuse the new job, then I'll say, okay, are these parts experiencing depression? If they are, they're not gonna go anywhere. So then I asked the unconscious to resolve the depression, okay? Depression is like a braking system on any part. So… okay, let's say they're not experiencing depression, then typically when they get rid of the depression than they're ready to go to a new job, but sometimes, part say, no, we don't want that job, and I say, okay, are you ready for a vacation because you've been working so hard? Yes. I say, okay, vacation well-deserved. So umm… you can now start your vacation and umm… and if in the future you want a job you want something to do while you can step into that information processing job or some other job, okay? But that way I get rid of the parts. The trick is getting rid of all the parts that's the only way you can shut down one of these chronic conditions, okay? So once those parts have gone on vacation, then I'll ask the… that the addictive force be turned off. And now here's another thing. I will also ask the whole system, are there any parts that are grieving the loss of using this substance? Parts that have really gotten quite attached to this substance are there any parts that really need to grieve the loss of this substance because it's gone away. And quite often it's a yes. So then I will ask the unconscious… first I'll just do a quick… quick summary of what grief is of the process and ultimately coming to this place where parts can let go and move on, move forward and say goodbye to the substance. Will the unconscious now move all parts that need to go through this grief, through the grief until its completion? Typically, I get a yes. And then I'll ask for yes Frank it'll lift up when these parts of all moves through the grief. And then I will ask, okay, are all parts now able to say goodbye to alcohol or heroin or whatever it is, okay? So umm… did I get to your question? 

01:19:55
UNKNOWN Well, you getting there. I just wonder what happens to the deeper vulnerability like the deeper fear or shame that's driving the whole system. You're talking about the protective parts mainly out of the addictive force, right? So what happens to that underlying vulnerability here? 

01:20:15
BART WALSH Okay. So we're gonna go back to Goldfinger. Okay? Because this… this is a procedure that employs ideomotor signaling and I like to do this before we get into the substance piece because I like to have whoever I'm working with be as emotionally stable as possible. When we just got a few minutes for this but here's the way it goes. I'll ask a person if you could unload the emotional burdens of the past would you like to do that, okay? Some people say, no, but majority say, yes. And so then we developed ideomotor signals, and… and I asked the unconscious I tell the unconscious I want to ask some questions about the emotional past and when I use the term passed I'm referring to anytime in your life before today, trusting the unconscious to have great facility moving through time and space, trusting that it knows you so well. And then I'll ask the unconscious, is there any fear from the past that you continue to carry? I get a yes, then I say since you've been through all the experience of the past and you have whatever learning from experience can serve you well in the present, will that fear now be released and resolved in whatever way is truly best for you at this time? If I get a yes, then I ask a finger to lift up on the person's free of the fear. If I get a no, then I'll say, is there something important that needs to be clearly understood by way of resolving that fear? Typically, I'll get a yes. Will that important information become very clear as the fear is resolved? Get a yes, then again I wait for the finger to lift up when they're free of the fear. Then… then I'll ask now that person's free of the fear, is there a place in the past to put all the thoughts and perceptions that are no longer appropriate in the present, okay? That's a cognitive ratification. If I get a yes, than that happens and I ask you yes finger to lift up and that adjustment is done. Now I go through a whole set of emotions, I goes through fear, and guilt, and shame, and anger, and emotional pain, and anxiety, and depression, and… and typically I do that first before I asked for the ratifications, but for the sake of time right now once we go through the cognitive ratification than I… I tell the person that perhaps you can move just a little bit into the future to see how your experience can be, now that you're free of these emotional burdens from the past. And really understand your full experience in that future picture, your thoughts, your emotions, your behaviors. And when you have that awareness very clearly that yes finger can lift up, okay? So I just wait until the picture develops. So they've got a new perspective on themselves, okay? Okay. Then once that happens and they're fully alert in the present. There's a behavioral ratification that can be applied in many different ways. Now for some people I ask them to consider what they would like to do to mark this change? And I say, it might be some kind of ritual that you'd like to perform and design, or it might be something that you've been wanting to do for a long time but really couldn't let yourself umm… I want you to think about something you can do to really mark this important change uh… you know, unloading those emotional burdens. And then I tell them to give me a call so we can set up our next appointment once they have that idea firmly in place, okay? So there's a little pressure on them that way. And… and different people have well… well we've done some pretty crazy things. One fellow built a little… a little ship uh… that he put all his garbage on and send it down (inaudible) river and… and there was a woman that umm… she said, she couldn't tell me what… what she was going to do because it was illegal. What she did, she was… she had a plan a trip to New York and so she… she wrote out all her garbage on a piece of cardboard paper and made a paper airplane out of it, went to the top of the Empire State Building and threw it out, okay. So… Okay. So, that's in a nutshell the Goldfinger method, but it's… it's a quick non-invasive way to get at a lot of emotion. Okay. Umm… Questions? Because we're gonna have to close things up in a few minutes. We… we… we covered a lot and… and I mean, I threw a lot at you in 90 minutes, uh… but you do have the slides and umm… those two books I told you about are available in this all sorts of detailed information in there. And any questions or… or if any of you want more material other articles or so forth. Please email me. I will send stuff to you and respond to you. Oh, yeah. Can we get the microphone? 

01:26:25
UNKNOWN Admittedly I'm a total newbie to all this, but I find myself wondering how many of those yes's are the patient wanting to make the therapist happy by giving the right response, and how do you count for that? 

01:26:40
BART WALSH Well, that's a very good question. And I can tell you that it takes a little practice umm… doing ideomotor questioning with people to see the difference between intentional movements and… and unconscious movements. And uh… typically the… the conscious movements are just quick and more direct the unconscious movements usually start with a bit of a quiver and so forth, but even then umm… I'll uh… I will talk to people, question them, and umm… periodically someone will say, well, I was… I was doing it intentionally. And I said, okay, so now would you like the benefits? And then we will go over through everything again. So it does happen that the people it's more often very young people that will do it intentionally.
