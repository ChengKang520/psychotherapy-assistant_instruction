00:27:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:27:15
NORMAN I. KAGAN ...of that out and the kind of questions on how does it affect the relationship between your husband and you. And I wasn't making enough progress, feeling a little frustrated about that. 

00:27:25
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:27:25
UNKNOWN  Yeah, I, I would think I was marginally aware that that was the direction you would have gone and I was hedging. 

00:27:35
NORMAN I. KAGAN I was, I was sensing some tension within myself, ah, as I tried to ah, get our interview involved in that kind of material. And, ah, I just, it felt the tension building up as I, wasn't getting in her way.

UNKNOWN Yeah, I think I was running from myself. 

00:28:40
NORMAN I. KAGAN Uh hmm. You don't wanna... (crosstalk) 

00:28:40
UNKNOWN My rationale right now is that it isn't, that that area is pretty okay with us and that I can view it in kind of the broader perspective than as far as dealing with down feelings or getting at relationship is concern. Uhm, usually, that comes longer. I don't sometimes allowing, it can even be facilitate. 

00:29:10
NORMAN I. KAGAN May I know if there's about me, my, my manner or demeanor that sort of held you back from, from a, in talking about the sexual aspect that would, for making you wanna pull back.

00:29:39
UNKNOWN  Yeah, so what I see from myself is I need to choose some involvement type things. I'm not involving myself with people. 

00:29:45
NORMAN I. KAGAN I got into a judgment there which I implore, I felt that she was doing things correctly and, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:29:55
UNKNOWN Ah. 

00:29:55
NORMAN I. KAGAN felt very badly when I realized what I was saying, wished I could take it back and, ah, ah, or said it on the, no, on judgmental way. But, ah, I'm curious to know how that came across to you as I said, you're... (crosstalk) 

00:30:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:30:10
NORMAN I. KAGAN ...doing this correctly. 

00:30:10

00:30:15
NORMAN I. KAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:30:15
UNKNOWN ...felt comfortable. 

00:30:15
NORMAN I. KAGAN  The thing that, maybe something about my tone of voice or something that sort of compensated for the. (crosstalk) 

00:30:20
NORMAN I. KAGAN  Yeah. And the, the, the flow of the thing, you know, 

00:30:25
NORMAN I. KAGAN Hmm. 

00:30:25
UNKNOWN  of not just that isolated instance but the general. I feel like we're relating of family(ph) and pretty well... (crosstalk) 

00:30:35

UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:30:40
[sil.] 

00:30:40
UNKNOWN  So, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:30:45
NORMAN I. KAGAN And that's, I heard you're turning (inaudible ) 

00:30:48
UNKNOWN I guess I have to trust myself... (crosstalk) 

00:30:50
NORMAN I. KAGAN Uh hmm. 

00:30:50
UNKNOWN ...to trust something that, (crosstalk) 

00:30:50

00:31:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:31:08
NORMAN I. KAGAN ...it's very important to stay with where the patient is as much as possible and, ah, yet conduct the necessary business in the time that's allotted, (crosstalk) 

00:31:15
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:31:15
NORMAN I. KAGAN and I would sense that in the end, it become more efficient if I can allow some of that to happen at least, and, ah, we can, get more out of it both of us than if I try to control completely what's going on. 

00:31:30
UNKNOWN Well, for my side, I could, I'll buy that. 

00:31:30
NORMAN I. KAGAN  Yeah.

UNKNOWN Right. 

00:34:55
UNKNOWN ...through I'm (inaudible ).

00:35:00
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:35:00

00:35:15
UNKNOWN  I wanted for him to set the pace. 

00:35:20
UNKNOWN  Uh hmm. 

00:35:25
UNKNOWN At this point from the tape? 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN Yeah, I wanted you to take some action. 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN Uh huh. 

00:35:30
UNKNOWN  Yeah, I've wanted you to focus to be on you. I wanted you to talk. I also realized in watching this that I started talking. 

00:35:40
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:35:40
UNKNOWN  So that makes me ensure about what I really did want. Then, I thought at the time, I wanted Bob(ph) to start in. 

00:35:50
UNKNOWN Yeah, I'm asked him and the thing that I asked him for you is we, we're getting to some like this, to tell me along with that to, to get into things about me where you see it's inconsistent with me, you know, coz, so easy to, to talk about where you are like like then that you simply setting the pace. And I cannot, this kind (inaudible ) feeling but I, I think you're most familiar to that. And that, you know, and I want you to, to kind of, to get into that too and talk about that if we, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:36:15
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:36:15

00:36:38
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:36:38
UNKNOWN  Yeah. And that's, but I don't like. (crosstalk)

UNKNOWN Because of, that's... (crosstalk) 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

00:36:40

00:36:40
UNKNOWN We're trying. 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN ...vulnerable to each of us. 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:36:40
UNKNOWN  Yeah. 

00:36:45
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) I wonder if you would agree that there is value in the recall process, especially mutual recall for couples who are trying to understand and improve their interactions. In fact, when Dr. Kagan conducted courses for couples, he used the entire IPR Series including the elements of communication, the Affects Simulation Vignettes, and individual and mutual recalls. Can you see the potential value of such courses for couples? How about the uses of IPR courses (inaudible ) couples for whom improved communication is critically important such as couples and which one member has a serious chronic illness?

Dr. Henya Kagan (Klein) 

00:37:25
Dr. Henya Kagan (Klein) 

00:37:25
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) IPR can also be used by groups to study their interactions. The processes be used for instance, at staff meetings and let's say Parole Board sessions. In this film, it helps team uses the IPR process to study the quality of their interactions. This group of people was about to set up a health care practice using an innovative approach in medicine. Prior to this taped session, they had met many times in an attempt to work out how they could function effectively as an egalitarian team. Their goal was to achieve a collaborative relationship where each person on the team had important professional expertise to contribute to patient care. They were working toward developing more for partnership than a leader-follower relationship. It would have been easy yet, of little help for a consultant watching the interaction to indicate to the pediatrician that his use of technical terms might interfere with group communication. In fact, by using medical jargon, the pediatrician was very aware of the probable effect of his behavior. He could link up with the internist while shutting out the social worker. In doing so, he could maintain his dominant position in the group and insuring himself some sense of security. As you listen to the recall, we think you will see what we mean. 

00:39:50
DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) The Health Team consists of four people: From left to right, an internist, a nurse practitioner, a social worker, and the pediatrician. The pediatrician described the mother and the baby he had recently examined. Beyond the session, he proposed that the Health Team become involve in the care of the entire family; the mother, father and infant. Here are some brief excerpts from the Team's recall session. 

00:40:15
Mutual Recall Session: Health Team 

00:40:15
UNKNOWN  I notice at that time, although I had notice the first visit between picking much of it that the mother herself had something wrong with one of the eyes. Ah, and she seemed very, very, very concerned that the baby was gonna wind up with a defect in her eye. On questioning her about it, she seem to, wasn't sure of what was wrong but apparently... (crosstalk) 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN Uhm. 

00:40:45
UNKNOWN ...had Stevens-Johnson syndrome as a child. And the destruction of her left eye or deformity was blamed on this. And both she and her husband are very, very concern about the baby's life. (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
UNKNOWN Who, who went at. (crosstalk) 

00:40:55
UNKNOWN The mother. And it's the same all with the baby's infection presently is. 

00:41:00
UNKNOWN What's the Stevens-Johnson... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN I think, I think Dan(ph) answer that. 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN ...syndrome? 

00:41:05
UNKNOWN I'm, I don't know if there's (inaudible ) 

00:41:11
UNKNOWN It's, it's a hypersensitivity. 

00:41:11
UNKNOWN I got the explanation. Ah, I think partly, my, my question had to do, was really saying, "Hey, fellows, you know, you're leaving me out." I, there's a lingo goes on here that I just don't understand. And, (crosstalk) 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN and if we're having a conference of four people, (crosstalk) 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:41:25
UNKNOWN then, if you're gonna use a term that I don't understand, ah, perhaps, you are to think about it in advance to stop in saying with that. (crosstalk) 

00:41:30
UNKNOWN It wa, it was very clear, I think almost conscious at the time that I was using the medical, I thought about using the medical terminology. And I think I am, was using on purpose specifically to link up with Dan(ph). So that maybe is a way of shutting you up that I. (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
UNKNOWN What... (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
UNKNOWN I know that you use... 

00:41:45
UNKNOWN ...did you want? 

00:41:45
UNKNOWN You, (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
UNKNOWN You should (inaudible ) 

00:41:48
UNKNOWN you assure him, both of us. 

00:41:48
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:41:48
UNKNOWN It was realized that. 

00:41:50
UNKNOWN No, there's no way I could know that, that funny (inaudible ) that I knew that Rita(ph) was going to ask and somehow, it was better to Ri, (crosstalk) 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:41:55
UNKNOWN  for Rita(ph) to ask than for me, what I'm supposed to be. (crosstalk) 

00:42:00
UNKNOWN I'm recalling it now. There was something about saying it and I knew Rita(ph) was gonna be shut out. 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN Well, that was a real ripple do(ph) because I, I, (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN I was left scratching my head after that. (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:42:05
UNKNOWN I mean, Stevens-Johnson, (crosstalk) 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN Stevens-Johnson like that. 

00:42:10
UNKNOWN As you realized, Rita(ph) was gonna be shut out. Do you recall anything else that went along with that line? 

00:42:15
UNKNOWN  No. It was, it's almost, I'm rec, I'm recalling now and I think I'm processing now that maybe, I, I wanted to link up with Dan(ph) in some way and used the medical jargon. I also know when I do that that that shuts Rita(ph) out. I don't think at the time... (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:42:30
UNKNOWN ...there were feelings about wanting to shut her up. (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
UNKNOWN Shut her up. (inaudible )(crosstalk) 

00:42:36
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:42:37
UNKNOWN What did you want to happen between you and Dan(ph)? Do you recall? 

00:42:37
UNKNOWN  Well, the, and probably, some communication around the patient. There was we, with the two doctors in a team, we can link up in that way, in a traditional(ph) kind of way. And that's, you know, it's your... (crosstalk) 

00:42:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:42:52
UNKNOWN ...role and my role and, and we can communicate. 

00:42:52
UNKNOWN  I was feeling left then, very left then. But I knew, I knew that Rita(ph), somehow I knew that Mike(ph) wanted to link up with Dan and that Rita(ph) was going to ask a question. 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN Ah hah. 

00:43:05
UNKNOWN So at one side I was feeling bad that that was being put on the spot with biggest, I knew that he wasn't going to be, to answer that question being a pediatric condition. And that much all I knew. But I (inaudible ) what it was somehows(ph) on you that Mike(ph) was leaving Rita(ph) rather than me. But it was leaving me out too. 

00:43:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:43:30
UNKNOWN We have already battling(ph) feelings as you thought left out, do you recall what that felt like (inaudible )? 

00:43:37
UNKNOWN  Uhm, [sil.] I think I remember blushing. I'm blushing now. (laughing) 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN Yes. 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN So shall we go back to tape? (crosstalk) 

00:43:50
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN Anything else? 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN you. 

00:43:55
UNKNOWN So I don't know where her husband's been receiving care. But the, the thing that bothers me the most is they're obviously have some kind of investment in this child not having, been able to have one for long time. And they are very very over concerned and over conscious about the child. I wasn't... (crosstalk) 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:44:15
UNKNOWN ...having a life family conflicts about it and I think it's something in me to think about. And when the mother and father come in for medical care which I'm going to do that we all need to pick up on this and, and I think begin to work with. 

00:44:25
UNKNOWN The, the person I'm watching on the screen seems articulate and most what he's talking about and very sure about where he's at and I don't feel that way when I talk. 

00:44:35
UNKNOWN  But anyone remember anything at that point on the tape? 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:44:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:44:43
UNKNOWN  I do. Uhm, I'd, I wasn't, I thought you were very articulate in what you are saying. I wasn't very sure what you wanted of us to. (crosstalk) 

00:45:00
UNKNOWN (inaudible ) 

00:45:03
UNKNOWN  There was my feeling that we were, that I was, that I have to think of a question to ask you... (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. 

00:45:10
UNKNOWN ...but I couldn't think of one. 

00:45:10
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
UNKNOWN  Mainly, because I didn't know exactly what you wanted. 

00:45:15
UNKNOWN  And that we really didn't know what, in, in (inaudible ) conference what were talking about what was being asked of, of the team do... (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN Yeah, right. 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN ...at this time, it was, was just like... (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:45:25
UNKNOWN ...we're here as I know (inaudible ) what she's talking around, we're going to listen to what it is. And, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:45:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:45:30
UNKNOWN the way we deal with that is we may drift, we may listen, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN you know, rather than listen. (crosstalk) 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN Did any others, (crosstalk) 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:45:35
UNKNOWN any other options go through your mind at the time? Did any other. (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
UNKNOWN Uhm, options. 

00:45:40
UNKNOWN  The funny po(ph), (inaudible ) on one, that was saying is that I just remember that one thing that I wanted to do was to ask Mike(ph) clearly what is it that you want of us.(crosstalk) 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN Okay. Let's say, (crosstalk) 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN What would you li(ph). 

00:45:55
UNKNOWN I, I think why (inaudible ) and ask. 

00:45:59
UNKNOWN  Yeah, I do. (crosstalk) 

00:46:00
UNKNOWN May(ph), do you recall what, what you did with that thought, that temptation? 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN I kept that. (laughs) 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN Ah hah. And... (crosstalk) 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN I. 

00:46:05
UNKNOWN ...any idea of the reasoning for keeping in, keeping it at the time? 

00:46:10
UNKNOWN  Uhm, I think I was afraid of putting Mike(ph) on the spot. 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN Uh huh. 

00:46:15
UNKNOWN  Uhm. 

00:46:20
UNKNOWN What, did you have a fantasy of what that would be like to put Mike(ph) on the spot? 

00:46:20
UNKNOWN  Well, a little bit like what Mike(ph) did with Dan(ph). (laughs) 

00:46:25
UNKNOWN  Did you put that (inaudible). 

00:46:30
UNKNOWN Uhm, yeah, I don't think that Mike(ph) knew where was I on that precise moment. 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:46:35
UNKNOWN And for me to ask, I didn't know how to ask the question at that point in time in such a way that I could get him gently into the question rather than abruptly saying, well, what do you really want of us, you know.

UNKNOWN  The risk of doing that, do you recall what the risk was? What will happen if you did it? Did you fantasized that? 

00:47:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. With my fantasy that would Mike(ph) would go uh hmm, uh hmm, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:47:05
UNKNOWN (inaudible ). 

00:47:09
UNKNOWN and then after this, we, uhm, get him. Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN You would get it? 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN Yeah, I mean, he would be angry with him. (crosstalk) 

00:47:15
UNKNOWN Ah hah.

DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN)  This film shows us the incredible ability we have to read very subtle(ph) the person may suggest(ph).

DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) For instance, in this interaction, the pediatrician looks at the screen and says, "The person I'm looking at seems articulate. I don't feel articulate when I speak." It is interesting to hear this dominant person say he feels insecure or inarticulate. Could these feelings be a factor in his need to dominate? And what is the nurse practitioner's fantasy of what will happen if she ever confronted him? Her fantasy is that he will go, "Uh huh, uh hmm, uh-huh, uh hmm, and then I will get it." She actually has a fantasy of his becoming inarticulate. What she probably has never actually witnessed but says as, "Isn't it incredible how he picked up subtle communication leakage or concerns about our fears from each other?"

DR. HENYA KAGAN (KLEIN) In terms of inquiry technique, did you notice at one point (inaudible ) to recall that the pediatrician asked the question of the group rather than talk about his own recall. Why didn't somebody say something were his words? Did you noticed how the inquirer ignored his question and continue the recall of the nurse practitioner? It is important that the inquirer do everything possible to keep the group on task and try to not allow one member to dominate the others.
