JOHN GOTTMAN Uhm, and that's why it's very important to really think that there are eight different emotional command systems and they're all important. The other thing emotion focused therapy says quite often is that when people are angry, the commander in chief that, in fact, underneath that is really the sentry. It's really about fear. Anger is about fear underneath it, quite a lot of the time. And I claim anger is very often about anger. Anger is very often about unfairness, injustice in the relationship. If my wife is mad at me because she's doing all the housework and all the child care, she is angry for a good reason cuz fairness is very important in relationships. And I need to really be able to embrace her anger, process that negative affect for, for attunement. Okay, so I mention this because I think that's very important. Also, I think really in everyday interaction, emphatic resonance is a very rare thing. And let me try to prove that to you and what I'm gonna try to prove to you is that, ah, the basis of all relationships is fucking up. Uhm, that it-- that rather than thinking that in, in a good relationship, communication is part of the course and if it's not a good relationship, then, you know, we have a lot of miscommunications. On the contrary, the, the sine qua non of relationships is screwing up and repairing it. So let me try to prove that to you mathematically. If you estimate the percent of time that you're with your partner, that you are ready to listen with an open heart, non-defensively, empathetically, lovingly, a very Christ-like way, uhm, would you agree that 50% of the time is the generous estimate. Okay, so that's like the probability of flipping a coin and getting a head, right? Now ask what's the probability that both people will be emotionally available, ready to listen with an open heart at the same time. Assuming independence, the probability is 25%, right? It's like getting two heads, flipping two coins and getting two heads, right, .5 times .5, 25%. So even with this generous estimate of emotional availability, 75% is right ground for regrettable incidence were you miscommunicate and if you take a more reasonable estimate like 30% emotional availability, then 91% is right ground for miscommunication. So my conclusion is regrettable incidence inevitable in all relationships. It's my job to be the major person in my wife's life that hurts her feelings. That's what you gets for being in a relationship. She's the major person to hurts my feelings and I'm the major person that hurts her feelings. But, but what, what, you know, negative affect just happens. Uhm, so, you know, George Carlin talked about this, ah, the co-- late comedian who said, you know, it should happens, right? We can never see that bumper stick around the Rolls-Royce, that was George Carlin. Well, I think, I think it actually happens on-- to Rolls-Royces, too. Uhm, and, and really being there, in the phase of negative affect, my hypothesis is that, is that bonding is created, attunement is created by turning toward negative affect and fully processing conflict and failures to connect, failures, you know, bids that fail, uhm, much more than positive affect system like orgasm has. And I might be wrong about this but there are lot of examples that abound. Yeah, orgasms do create oxytocin and trust, and bonding but exploring in the phase of fear, climbing mountains, space exploration, turning toward a neighbor in the phase of natural disastrous like the Joplin, Missouri tornado. When, you know, I thought it was so amazing that people's houses where leveled by this big tornado that was a mile wide and leveled people's whole houses. It lost everything and their neighbors came out and the first thing the neighbors did, almost every neighbor was to say can I help you? Can I be there for you? Can I comfort you? It was amazing and that creates a new town that has a renewed bonding, battle buddies in war, ah, which is why the reason coming home from the war after deployment is so difficult is that life and families feels totally blend compare to the tremendous, ah, bonding that takes place between battle buddies. Nobody goes into war alone and people go into war and are brave in war to really support their battle buddies, that's enormous, so that when they fight about, him leaving the socks on the floor. When he comes home, ah, thoughts of suicide abound cuz it seems so unimportant, ah, surviving adversities like great loss, illness, uhm, and hos-- hospices for example. Orgasm really fails in comparison to this kind of bonding. So the major research finding, another way of saying it is that attunement is primarily built by processing everyday shit. Shit is inevitable in all relationships and, you know, and when, reporters asked me what it is that couples mostly argue about? Is it sex? Is it money? Is it in laws? My answer is, the major thing that couples argue about is absolutely nothing, nothing, you know. They are, they're watching TV and he's got the remote and he says, "Let me see what else is on." She says, "Leave it on that channel." He says, "Well, let me see what else is on." She says, "No, leave it." And he says, "Fine." And she says, "Well, the way you said fine now that, that really hurt my feelings." And he says, "Well, I said fine cuz you're gonna have it your way. You goes, let me watch what, whatever is on. I, I wanna see if there's a James Bond movie. And I don't wanna watch television with you." And he leaves and what are they arguing about? Nothing but, of course, there's something there, right? There is some negative affect that happens and it needs to be processed and talk about. What were you feeling? So how do you do that? How do you process? And the answer is that you use the aftermath of a fight on and, and, and I'll talk about that in a moment. So you really should be asking at this point, you know, what's your evidence? Can you use this processing of negative affect to really change distrust into trust? You're saying that trust is built by really attuning in these small moments of negativity and the answer is, "Yes, we can." Empirically, in a randomized clinical trial and, ah, with a hundred couples, ah, the-- our art and science of love workshop significantly increase distrust compare to a control group. So we got significant increases in our trust metric, we don't know how long this will last though. Okay, but how do we do it in therapy? How do we create attunement? Trust, remember, is about turning toward our partner when our partner feels negative affect. Uhm, and it can be about, ah, negative affect about us that our partner is feeling or, or something else. Ah, so-- okay, that's-- I already said that, okay. So what we use to create trust is, ah, a blueprint that comes from, ah, a modification of Anatol Rapoport's, ah, work on international conflict. And what Rapoport suggested was that the way to deal with conflict constructively was to postpone persuasion until each person can state their partner's position to their partner's satisfaction. So this is like the active listening method, the mirroring method, except it's different and that we give responsibility to the speaker as well as the listener. So if you start harshly, if you point your finger at your partner and you tell your partner what's wrong with your partner constructively, you're gonna get the Four Horsemen, okay. So in order to have an effective conflict blueprint, you cannot just put all the responsibility on the listener. You need to have the following tasks and this is in your handout, you postpone persuasion, speaker, you do not blame, you use I statements rather than you statements, and you express the positive need which is really what you need not what you don't need. And the ideas with in every negative affect, there is a longing and in that longing, there is a wish, there's a hope, and therefore, a recipe for your partner being successful with you. And what we do is give people clipboards and pins to take notes and listener takes notes, summarizes the partners entire position, not the last sentence the partner said but the entire position and validates it by completing a sentence like it make sense to me that you have these feelings and needs be cut. And if the, ah, the listener, ah, the speaker needs to feel understood, let's just say speaker said to listener, then, ah, then we problem solve. Okay, and that's, that's on your, ah, on your, ah, handout as well. Now when, when the conflict, however, is about these perpetual gridlock problems, we have to use the dreams within conflict intervention. And, ah, and the dreams within conflict intervention is really not trying to resolve conflict, it's trying to move them from gridlock to dialogue. And they just asked this six questions, the listener ask this six questions. What beliefs and values are in this issue for you? Explain why this is so important to you. Is there story behind this field? Is this the relate to your history? What do you wish for? What is your dream? Is there a disastrous scenario in not having this dream. Okay, those aren't really it. That was the six questions in the dreams within conflict intervention. So, so far, we have talked about the Gottman, Rapoport blueprint which is for current conflicts, the dreams within conflict intervention which is another way of attunement when there's gridlock conflict, when it's, ah, when it's a conflict about an existential issue for example, not just about balancing the budget and about money mean? And then the third part of attunement is to be able to process the regrettable incident and the tool here is this aftermath kit and let me show you what that is. So this is what we do, uhm, this is, this is a little booklet that we have and you can order it on a website gottman.com. It's very expensive though, of course, a dollar and 90. That's, that basically what it cost this is to print it. So, ah, this has five steps and it's kinda hard to read this but I'll read it to you so you can see what it's about. Basically, the idea in processing the regrettable incident is that both people need to believe that there are two points of view that are both right, okay. Two different perspectives that have validity and ins-- and the ideas that you can process a, a regrettable incident when you're flooded. You need to have some emotional distance from it and it's kind of like the metaphor of you being in the balcony of theater, at intermission, and you're talking about act one except that you were the actors on the stage, the two of you. And the first thing we talk about is what did you feel in this regrettable incident? So step one is feelings, step two is what are your realities? What did-- how did you, ah, what did you perceive happened in that regrettable incident? And the third step is what are your triggers? What escalated you? So this has Harville Hendrix talks about childhood wounds, right? And William Faulkner in Requiem for a Nun said, "The past is never dead. In fact, it's not even past." Great line because the trigger is a really saying what escalated you in this regrettable incident? What made you go bananas? And why is that a trigger for you? That's the third step, why is that a trigger for you? What is the story of that? How do you-- if you rewind the video tape of memory and stop at the place where you had this feelings in your past, what comes up for you? And what's the story of that? And the first step is taking responsibility. Uhm, acknowledging your own role in apologizing for what you did to create the miscommunication, the regrettable incident and this is Dan Wile's admitting mode and then five constructive plans, how do you make this better next time? All right, and what's different about this little booklet is only that we jumpstart the process so instead of asking people to talk about how they felt, we asked them to read the feelings they had. Actually, our latest draft, this one has 45 feelings. How did you feel defensive? Now, listen to feelings got hurt, totally flooded, angry, sad, unloved, misunderstood, uhm, worried, afraid and so on, ah, had no influence. He say-- so rather than saying what did you feel? We can have the booklet and they can actually read and I think we're up to 56 feelings now. So it's makes a little bit easier, just jumpstart it. And then what are your realities? So, ah, you take turns talking about how you perceive this but really not pointing your finger at your partner, saying what you perceive, what you heard, what you remember, your partner takes notes and validates, ah, and you talk about what you might have needed in that regrettable incident. And the third step is the triggers and why are those triggers? Ah, fourth step is taking responsibility and, ah, talking about how you specifically, ah, contributed to the miscommunication in the regrettable incident and what do you wanna apologize for. And then, constructive plans for dealing with the re-- regrettable incident. This, ah, this aftermath kit is, ah, very powerful, it is very emotional and it's the basis for, uhm, one of the basis for dealing with, uhm, the aftermath of an affair and I'll talk about that in the workshop, ah, tomorrow. Ah, gottman.com, gottman.com, you can get it. Uhm, and I-- you know, I give it out to couples so that they have it and they can use it every time they have a regrettable incident which they will have so-- and I tell them the goal of couples therapy is not to avoid regrettable incidents and not to eliminate regrettable incidents, they're gonna have them. The goal is for them to be able to repair but at the end of therapy, they should be repairing their own regrettable incidents without me. They should be using the Gottman-Rapoport blueprint to deal with current conflict, ah, the aftermath as their past conflict. And if they have gridlock conflict, they should be using the dreams within conflict and they should be doing all this without me but writing me a check, okay. And at a certain point, they're gonna say we don't really need him, you know, and we don't need to write him a check anymore. We can get rid of him and then we move to just sort of having checkups every couple of months. Now, to building the other part of building trust is building intimate trust. And, ah, and for building intimate trust, we really need to help people have intimate conversations that aren't about conflict, they're about understanding each other better and listening to one another. Ah, they're about helping each other cope with stress and we learned that from checkups and research following up couples that, ah, people help one-- excuse me. If people have the stress reducing conversation, they're much less likely to relapse after therapy. So we teach the stress reducing conversation and extend that ability to listen to all intimate conversations. But as I mention, you know, the therapist needs to really be able to build all eight emotional command systems. So building personal sex is a part of this. Viktor Frankl defined pornography as impersonal sex. I think he was right. Ah, in pornography, you can plug anyone in. Ah, any prostitute will do although, I think, it's very interesting, there was a recent study done-- I've read about it in the New York times, the sociologist interviewed high priced call girls to find out what was the most common thing that their customers wanted from them sexually. And I think about a thousand call girls were interviewed and the major thing that male customers wanted from high priced female call girls was for them to pretend that they were their girlfriend who love them. So, I think, it's one of the saddest things I've ever heard. So really, you know, these guys were hiring women to listen to them and find them interesting, to care about and communicate caring and affection, and love. Ah, so we ha-- we've created this, ah, this, ah, website called Gottsex, G-O-T-T sex and the Gottsex website really talks about creating really lovemaking. It's the art and science of making love. It's about passion, romance, and great sex. And these seven skills are part of it and redefining what sex is, skills through intimate conversation, building sex-love maps by asking questions about your partner's eroticism, your partner's sexual fantasies, building a ritual for initiating and refusing sex, a blueprint for talking about sex, the talking during sex, and the salsa card decks which have either one, two, or three peppers depending on how hot do you want the sexy things to be. Okay, so that's about trust but what about betrayal? Okay, so I got a lot of time, so I can tell you about all of this research. Betrayal occurs in any interaction that becomes a power struggle and my definition of the betrayal metric is a zero sum game when my gain is my wife's lost, when her gain is my lost, that's a betrayal metric. And the way to measure it is to really look at the rating dials over time. As we see here, the blue is a wife's rating dial over their 15-minute conflict discussion and the husband is the red one. Totally negatively related, zero sum game but if you add them up, that will be a straight line. All right, just a straight line. So, you know, those kinds of conversations I define as being betrayal conversations. Even if betrayal hasn't happened yet, even if there's been no sexual betrayal, having a betrayal metric-- excuse me, predicts early husband death in our 20 year longitudinal study. The couples who had a betrayal metric, 58% of the husband's died in this 20 year period, we-- compare to 22% for the couples who had a cooperative metric and that was true even controlling husbands age and health, very powerful effect. Having a betrayal metric kills men. Now what does kill men who doesn't kill women? And the answer is that men do not get very much blood pressure protective effect from oxytocin because we secrete vasopressin as well. And vasopressin in rats increases after they have an orgasm because they don't go to sleep, they are trying to ward off rivals. Vasopressin increases aggression so we're ready to ward off rivals after we have an orgasm, although many of us find it's possible to not worry about that so we can immediately go to sleep. So our sec-- our second study actually found that, ah, with a betrayal metric, people's blood is flowing faster. Oh, thank you, thank you. Thanks very much. So that actually the, the mechanism for the early death of husbands maybe that there's chronic, ah, higher myocardial contractility, in other words, when you're in a relationship that is not a trusting, well, it is a betrayal relationship were betrayal is po-- possible that everybody's blood is flowing faster all the time chronically, that maybe what the mechanism is, at least that suggest. Okay, so, so, ah, let me skip this line. I don't like this line right now. Yeah, no. Okay, so let's just go to at the ball phase part of this slide. So the trust metric was my partner behaves to maximize my pay offs, okay. And mutual trust is we both do that, we both act to maximize one another's pay offs and betrayal is a zero sum game, okay. His gain is my lost, her gain is, ah-- my gain is her lost. So, uhm, okay, so, now what's related to this betrayal metric-- what related to the trust metric was attunement, processing negative affect and so that's how you create trust. But how do you create loyalty instead of betrayal? And it turns out, this is a final surprising finding in this research is that the germ of distrust is not the same as the germ of betrayal. So in all the literature about trust and betrayal, uhm, low trust is almost the same as betrayal. If you don't trust somebody then, you know, it's the same as they might betray you. Ah, if you trust them, they won't betray you, right? But the surprising finding here is that trust and betrayal are different, different cycle logical processes and the cascade toward betrayal begins with what are called negative CL alt. Okay, now what is that? Uhm, what is the CL alt? What is it? What is the CL alt? Well, uhm, the answer is CL alt is something that Thibaut and Kelley suggested in 1959 and it means that I compare what I'm receiving from my wife to alternatives, okay? So let's say I smile at my wife and she smiles back. Now, I might go, wow, I love this woman. Look at that smile. I mean, it's-- I am one lucky SOB to have this-- be married to, to Julie. Or I might go, you know, I could have done better. That's not such a good smile, you know. I smile at her with a, with a full heart, a loving smile, look what I get back this crooked kind of funny smile, you know, and, you know, I notice she's not really that glad to me at the end of the day. You know, I come in and, you know, she, she hasn't really even pause and she's not that happy to see me. So you, so you judge every behavior by comparing it with real or imagined alternatives. So the germ of betrayal, I suggest is when you turn away from a partners need or their negative affect with the thought I can do better. That's a very simple idea and it was first suggested by Thibaut and Kelley, okay. So Julie and I had a case to work on, uhm, and we're doing the assessment, you know, standard Gottman assessment. We asked them about what the presenting problem was, ah, the-- this husband and wife that just had a baby recently. The baby was about 6 months old. The guy traveled a lot. He, he worked in Seattle but he also traveled to Vancouver. He was in Vancouver half of the time and Seattle half of the time and he said, "I have a mistress in Vancouver." Uhm, and, ah, you know, we, we're asking about, you know, what are your goals for the therapy? Why did you come to therapy? What's the story of what brings you to therapy? And she said, "Well, I've really-- I'm very unhappy in my marriage and, you know, my husband has been very cold to me since the baby was born. I really wanna work in improving communication." And he said, "I don't really know if I wanna stay with my wife because my mistress is much more, much less negative than my wife. And when I see my mistress in Vancouver, uhm, she's cheerful. Yeah, she has a child but, you know, she doesn't require anything of me. Uhm, she takes care of her child and, and she's always ready to have sex with me or make me a great meal, or rub my back and be nice to me. But when I come to Seattle, when I come home from work, you know, my wife says she's tired. She wants me to take care of the baby and work with the baby. She wants to rest and she, she doesn't want to have sex, you know." And he-- and she, she says, "Well, I don't have much libido since, you know, I had the baby." And he said, "Yeah, well, you know the mistress, he got a lot-- she gots a lot of libido." And of course, we said, "Well, you know, we don't think this therapy has a chance to being successful, all right?" All right, but here's another example of a couple, this is less extreme, ah, example of CL alt. So I was the sixth therapist this couple had, all right. Of course, I thought I was gonna be successful, you know, were the other five weren't successful, right? In the fifth session, the husband came in and said, "This is our last session. We're done." So I said, "Well, you know, I have, ah, 24 hour cancelation policy. You've already paid for the session. You have baby-sitters. So would please stay and help me understand why my therapy has failed with you?" And they said, "Okay." You know, they would. So, ah, we start talking about their week and we processed an argument they had. So they had a regrettable incident during the week. Ah, they, they went to a party and he met a woman at the party and he had this great conversation with her. He's really enjoying it and, ah, his wife have to manage the children and said, "I'm tired, I wanna go." And on the way home, he said, you know, "I was really enjoying that conversation with that woman. She, she kinda turned me on. You know, and I think she was a lot sexier than you are." So they had an argument. 

00:30:15
[sil.] 

00:30:20
JOHN GOTTMAN And as they are arguing, she thought he's so selfish. And she said, "You know, I'd be a lot happier with a more mature man." Because every time they argued, he was always trying to get the best he could in this relationship. So both in this regrettable incident, both had turned away from their partners need with the negative CL alt, okay. She-- when he said, he was attracted to this woman, ah, she did not say, "Okay, well, let's talk about our sex life cuz we haven't talk in a long time. And, you know, when I, I, I do get the feeling that you're not attracted to me and I'm upset about it." And when he argued during, during argument, she was thinking, "I don't wanna deal with your negative affect." They both turned away. I can do better. So I said to them, oh, they, they could now. I was done. I now understood why the-- why therapy did not worked for them and they could go so thank you very much for being here, you can go now. And they said, uhm, they wanted to know why I knew. You know, so I said, uhm, "Did you ever read the book Alice in Wonderland?" And said yeah, they said it. And I said now, you know, the thing about Alice is that when the white rabbit goes down the hall, Alice does not peer over the hole and say, you know, "Maybe I could do better than this white rabbit. Tomorrow, there might be a really more interesting white rabbit. And this hole looks kinda dirty." You know, "I could get my dress dirty." She just jumps down the hole and that's her journey, she's in Wonderland and it's-- that's her journey. And some of it, some of Wonderland is awful. The red queen is there, she cuts off people's heads, and so it is fabulous, you know. She makes the Cheshire cat, you know, and, and the caterpillar on the mushroom. That's her journey but you guys, you guys never really married each other. You guys are always thinking that something better can come along. And you're always really negotiating conflict to get the best that you'll-- you can get regardless of the effect on your partner. That's what characterizes your conflict and you're always thinking you can do better. Ah, so you never-- you have two children and a house and, ah, marriage and, you never really had any commitment to one another. And two, 2 months later, I call them up and, and I, I said, "I was wondering if you guys are still together." And they said, they were kinda stunned by the-- my last session with them and they now had another therapist and they were working on this idea of commitment. Okay, so... 

00:33:15
[sil.] 

00:33:20
JOHN GOTTMAN So negative-- so the hypothesis here that turns out to be supported by the data is that negative C-- CL alts, negative comparison, unfavorable comparisons begin to cascade toward betrayal. And even though Thibaut and Kelley suggested this concept in 1959 in applying game theory to social relationships, Caryl Rusbult is first person who measured it and Caryl Rusbult died about, ah, 3 years ago of breast cancer at age of 51 but she did 30 years of research on CL alt and it's interesting to me that lot of therapist had never heard of her. She's a very shy person, I gather. I've never met her but she has done the only research that was able to predict sexual infidelity. All the other research on sexual infidelity starts with the affair and, and asked people to retrospectively recreate what happened. You know, we know that people's retrospective accounts are highly flood. They always present themselves as innocent, right. So but Caryl Rusbult really was able to predict and, ah, and because of her research, I was able to use her measures of CL alt in my own research looking at the kind of observation to work in physiological data and the rating dial that Bob Levenson and I developed to try to relate the betrayal metric to this cascade. And so it turns out that there really are orderly determinist that cascades toward betrayal or loyalty that are really glacial in a relationship and I've laid this out as 24 steps. So now, so why 24 steps? Well, the more specific you can get about the cascade toward betrayal in relationship, the more you can understand it and so something about it. Okay, so here's what happens and I don't know if it's hard to read that but the first step is really turning away from your partner's negative emotion, turning away, dismissing it, and not attuning. And the second step is really not being there for your partner. That becomes a common event of not attuning. Op--sorry. Okay, that's followed by physiological arousal, okay. Remember the pulse oximeter so that goes along with it. There's an empirical finding so when people turn away from you, you actually have increase physiological arousal and flooding, then conflict starts becoming an absorbing state. The probably of entering negative affect is greater than the probability of exit or repair doesn't work. So the couple starts avoiding conflict cuz conflict sucks when it's an absorbing state. They suppress emotion. They may have big blow-offs but they really start avoiding conflict because it's unpleasant. Conflict avoidance is a very big part of every affair. Not only as conflict avoidance is a big part of every affair, self disclosure avoidance is a big part of every affair. So when you don't talk about what you're upset about, when you don't bring your shit to your partner, another way of saying that, you're negative affect, then you have a secret. You're keeping things secret from your partner and the tragedy there is that your partner doesn't get a chance to turn toward you. Even if your partner hasn't turned toward you a lot, your partner gets no chance if you keep s-- your needs secret. And then, step seven, as trust is eroding, negative CL alts start to come in accompanying you're keeping those secrets and turning away from your partner's needs as well. The eighth step is that you start not making as many bids for connection and you start investing less in the relationship. And you decrease the amount of dependency you have on the relationship for getting needs met. So every single, I've, I've guarantee you that every single couple you'll see whether there's been an affair, they are substituting what's not there in another relationship. They're thinking these things I can't get in this relationship so I'm not gonna ask for that, I'm gonna try to find them in other relationships. Somebody interested in me, somebody who wants to play ball me, somebody who wants to sail with me, somebody want to kayak with me, somebody who wants to laugh with me and go to movies with me, and there's this theory now I can't get this in this relationship. So the partner doesn't get a chance to shine for you, if you're looking for, for, for, ah, for that elsewhere and there's less sacrificing for the relationship, that's the 11th step, okay. Now-- what? Not sacrificing as much for the relationship-- less sacrificing for the relationship. So sacrificing for the relationship is the opposite of betrayal because it's really putting your partners needs ahead of your needs, right? And in, in a trusting relationship, people not only are looking at for their partner's needs but sometimes, their actually putting their own need second. Okay, 12th step is starting to maximize the partner's negative traits and minimizing the partner's positive traits. That is the opposite of cherishing. So love and cherishing is a process of maximizing your partner's positive qualities and minimizing your partner's negative qualities. You're really saying, you know, I love this person for these things and they are wonderful and I'm so lucky to have those things when you cherish your partner. But when your trashing your partner, you're doing the opposite. I'm sorry. 

00:40:00
[sil.]

JOHN GOTTMAN So this is trashing versus cherishing and cherishing is something that can be ritualize in a relationship. Ah, Jews have a way of ritualizing cherishing. So every Friday night in our house, ah, there's a ritual and part of the ritual for welcoming a Sabbath is the husband needs to sing a song to his wife called the Woman of Valor and it's a pro-- comes from Proverbs 30, 30 and the woman of val-- it's very ancient and, you know, and, and it's, it's, ah, it's very moving and sometimes it's hard to get through it without getting choke up. And it's really singing, you know, what you cherish about your wife. Ah, there's no such ritual for the wife doing it to the husband but, you know, I think, you know, men are a little more vulnerable to this negative CL alt thing. Uhm, the 15th step is trashing your partner to others not just in your own mind but now complaining to others and surely, Glass wrote about this in our classic book which was her magnum opus of her life. She also died very young of breast cancer. Shirley Glass, ah, is the-- was the mother of Ira Glass from This American Life on NPR, if you like that show. Shirley Glass-- the Glass family is pretty amazing. Philip Glass was an uncle, a composer, ah, so Shirley Glass wrote a book called Not Just Friends which is a brilliant book about affairs and infidelity and, ah, this idea of trashing the partner of other is, is a very big source of regrettable incidents when trying to help a couple, ah, heal from affairs. And basically, what gets nurture here is resentment versus gratitude. So the people are really nourishing their resentment toward what's not there versus the gratitude for what is there. Uhm, and people get lonely in the relationship. They're not really trying to get their needs met. They will end up having low libido, having less sex, having less fun, play, romance, they're not courting their partner anymore. There's not very much adventure, ah, they don't know much about, ah, their partners dreams or, ah, what their partner's sexual needs or fantasies are. They're really beginning to live parallel lives and there are fewer pro-relationship cognitions. Few thoughts-- fewer thoughts that this relationship is great and, ah, and they stop denigrating alternative relationships. So rather than creating a wide friend-- fence between themselves and others, they're not thinking, "Well, other relationships might be better.' And, ah, and they start really removing this fence between self and others. Shirley Glass talks about this as reversing walls and windows so what she meant by that was, you know, most couples, when they have a trusting relationship where there's no betrayal is sort stand shoulder to shoulder looking out the window from their house, right? So they're really-- they have, they have a window into each other, into each other's personality, into each other's, ah, internal world. And there's a fence between-- there's a wall between them and the rest of the world. But when there's-- when this begins to get reverse then there is secrets from the partner and once you start confiding in others, then they have a window into your relationship and your partner does not have a window into that confiding. So their-- they keep more and more secrets from their partner, uhm, they start actively turning toward others and finally, they allow themselves, give themselves permission to cross boundaries and real betrayal then unfolds. Okay, so we can now use this knowledge of this cascades toward betrayal to prevent betrayal and create loyalty because loyalty is the opposite, right? Loyalty is the positive CL alt, the cherishing, the magnifying your partner's positive qualities, minimizing your partner's negative qualities, trying to get your needs met in the relationship, what Bowlby called Effective Dependency, right? Ah, all relationships involved dependency, there's only effective or ineffective dependency. So we know how to do that now, we know to create trust and we have a theory for how to create loyalty and reverse the processes of betrayal but we know the least about healing from betrayal. Ah, there are only two studies that ever been done, one by Andy Christensen and one by Don Baucom. No, no, ah, control group, no randomized clinical trial has ever been done. So we need to blend, uhm, research, uhm, with practice based evidence, blended those two sources of wisdom. Ah, so here's our best guess about how to do this and, ah, with betrayal and then when we go back to the sound relationship house, we know that really all levels of the sound relationship house have been shattered, constructive, conflict management, I don't understand you at all. You know, there's conflict all the time. We know that the betrayed person really has a post traumatic stress disorder. Ah, the shared meaning system has been shattered. What do you value? What about our history? What's right? There's been deception, ah, who are you? The friendship system is ruin. All the specific processes or seven processes of the sound relationship house are shattered. So the therapy that we've created, that Julie and I created, we call, ah, atone, attune, and attach. So it's a three stage therapy and the first or the preliminaries to the first stage is our standard assessment with our questionnaire package, a conjoint interview, and oral history interview looking at how they deal with conflict, individual interviews. But we have to really make sure the affair is over, really over. If it's not over, couples therapy is contraindicated and then we have to set up transparency and verification methods that the affair is over. I don't know how many of you been lied to, ah, that the affair is over. I have several times, ah, working with couples to try to help them heal from an affair but it's a lie. Uhm, and, and, ah, ah, Don Baucum even refers to the idea that the couple creates a fund for a private investigator. Now here's an interesting thing. Ah, a lot of people find out really repulsive, you know, they create a fund for a private investigator. Uhm, if the affair is over my experience is if you suggest the fund for a private investigator and the affair is over, the person who had, had the affair will say, "I think it's a waste of money. You know, it hurts my feelings that you don't trust me but I can understand why you don't. I had an affair. If it makes you feel better, you know, and it's gonna make you trust me more, hire a private investigator." When the affair is not over the response is invariably, "I am morally offended that you would think that I would lie to you and betrayed you." So this is really a kind of cool test to suggest the mutual fund for private investigator and my wife hates that idea. She thinks it's disgusting. I think it's kinda cool. So, I mean, we don't actually agree a lot of the time about how to do things but, ah, Don Baucum has suggested this and I found that when you actually suggest this as an idea and you can even say, this is kinda weird but, you know, I've had a number of cases where, you know, people have said the affair is over and it's not and I think you really wanna create trust and, and create verification and transparency just like when two countries are, you know, ah, trying to negotiate about disarmament. They wanna make sure that they're both disarming and one of them is not gonna get, you know, ah, nuclear strike so they have to have verification. You know, and it's gonna built trust. Let's, you know, what do you think about hiring a private investigator? And, and it seems to be a very good test that if the affair is over, the person says, "It's a waste of money but go ahead and do it." If it's not over, the person says, "That really hurts me. I don't wanna be a part of this therapy if there's gonna be a private investigator fund." Okay, so anyway, ah, that's the only way to know. And you na-- mainly, you'd also individual sessions with the betrayer, part of what's happening for somebody who gives up an affair is there's a lot of grief about giving it up. There's loss and you need to really build an alliance with, with that person as well as the, the other person, the hurt partner. Okay, so you outline the, uhm, the therapy-- the atonement phase of therapy is the, is really important and the atonement dialogue has been described by Peggy Vaughan's research. Ah, I was able to help her design a questionnaire for that study but she really looked at anonymous, ah, responses to this questionnaire about people who had, ah, dealt with an affair, who had an affair and some of them had rescued the relationship and some hadn't. Most now with therapy and she tried to find out what characteristics were. And their-- and her report is available for free, ah, on a website called askpeggy.com, askpeggy.com if you wanna read it and it's very good but it really basically says, you've got it-- you've got to have this initial phase where you, ah, you help-- you explore the hurt partners post traumatic stress disorder explain it to the betrayer and allow the hurt partner to ask questions and help the betrayer to be non-defensive and empathetic as a listener in expressing his or her deep remorse. And you do not examine why the affair happened in this phase it risks blaming the victim. And the expressions of pain are okay, but not the Four Horsemen. You make sure that, you know, the person who's hurt really talks about their feelings and their needs but not, ah, using contempt and defensiveness and criticism. They're really asking what, what is true? What can I trust? The hurt partner is asking that. And again, trust is built by atonement so they bring their negative affect to the betrayer and they're asking questions. They're trying to find out, they need to talk about it but the therapist also needs to make sure that the questions are monitored so it doesn't-- they don't get ask at home. They, they got asked in session and they're not about the details of the sex because if they're about the details of the sex if feeds into the ruminations of the post traumatic disorder. So you have to really monitor this and it takes re-- it's really an art but, ah, that's the first stage, the atonement dialogue. Uhm, the second stage is attunement. So remember the conflict avoidance and self disclosure avoidance are setting conditions for affairs to happen, right? So we need to end conflict voids, we need to set up the Gottman-Rapoport blueprint for constructive conflict and create a personalized story of why the affair happened. You know, and take a look at the, at the, at the cascade toward betrayal, the negative CL alt, the investing lesson to relationship, the de-- decreased dependency, the, the, ah, destructive conflict discussions, and turning away from bids. The couple then, in this attunement phase, really learns how to turn toward negative affect and turn toward bids for connection. And part of what we do is we set up a weekly 1 hour, ah, sacred meeting called the state of the union meeting where they talk about what's going right in the relationship, give each other appreciations, and then talk about a regrettable incident that may have happened or a conflict discussion using one of those three blueprints. Either the, ah, you know, ah, aftermath of regrettable incident or the Rapoport blueprint, or the dreams within conflict and we ritualized cherishing and gratitude, ah, during this phase. And the other part that comes out of game theory is to establish norms and metanorms that support the relationship. That means they need to move away from the people who supported the affair and will keep the affair secret and start telling people close to them that they, they are rebuilding their relationship. And they need to surround themselves with people who support the relationship and get rid of people in their lives who really have supported the affair. Ah, okay, and the third step, the third phase is attachment. So atonement, a-- attunement and attachment, and here, we start really looking at the dreams within conflict for perpetual conflicts. Ah, they start learning the skills of intimate conversation.

Peter Pearson, Ph.D. 

00:53:55
PETER PEARSON Okay, thank you very. Hey, it is my pleasure and we have to get going for this great panel today on affairs, the crisis for the couple and challenges for the therapist. On my immediate right, Helen Fisher. On my-- next to Helen is Ellyn Bader, Esther Perel and John Gottman on board and we have a lot of to cover this morning. My biggest fear of a panel discussion is when one person on a panel says, "X." And everybody else on the panels says, "I agree, so do I." That's nice. I don't think we're going to have that problem today. I really look forward to this discussion and I have a few questions that I would like to ask but to start with the topic of panel, first of all which is, ah, infidelity create such a crisis. I'm wondering if all of you, the four of you see the crisis the same way or is the crisis-- you see the crisis as being, from your perspective, different-- differently. How do you see that-- ah, now, ah here's the other thing, all of you could res-- take a whole hour on any of these questions. So guess what I'm gonna suggest. 

00:55:10
UNKNOWN Sure. 

00:55:10
PETER PEARSON Thank you. Go ahead. What is the crisis that you see that when a couple comes in, infidelity is a problem? 

00:55:20
Ellyn Bader, Ph.D. 

00:55:25
ELLYN BADER Uhm, I'll, I'll start on, on one aspect of the crisis and first to say that, uhm, I don't like our typical crisis victim perpetuator models so I'm, ah, just say put that out but also I think that one of the essences of the crisis in this culture at this time in history is that, ah, women have fought hard for equality. Women, you know, we're no longer arranged marriages. We're no longer bought, we no longer have dowries, and we fought to get into egalitarian marriages and when somebody-- when there's infidelity, when there's lies, betrayal, deception, and, ah, particularly, when there's an affair, someone-- one partner has made a unilateral decision to break an equilateral commitment. And so I see that one of the essence and that we often end up with our clients some of the time talking about the wrong things because, how you repair in a way that builds the stability if that's what the couple is looking for believe that they can have a relationship that in fact not only is repaired but is better than what it was before takes a lot of work around, ah, realigning that power dynamic. 

00:56:50
PETER PEARSON Okay, anyone else? I just-- you guys can pass it back and forth then, I'll ask question later. 

00:56:55
UNKNOWN Uhm, I'm... 

00:56:55
John Gottman, Ph.D. 

00:56:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Well, I, I would say everything is broken when there's been an affair. Ah, and it, it's primarily the, ah, the deception that creates it but also the fact that, you know, it was, you know, as you say really a, a betrayal of a contract and, ah, you know, I mean it's, ah, it's funny to see because when you-- when you're thinking of how to repair, ah, a relationship, you realize that you have to be crazy to have an affair cuz it's so hard to repair it. Oh, it's as seems like wow, you know. 

00:57:40
PETER PEARSON Okay, thank you. Yeah. 

00:57:40
JOHN GOTTMAN If everybody knew what you have to through to, to create that new relationship that you talk about cuz that's what you really do in therapy as you create a new relationship. 

00:57:50
ELLYN BADER And that, and that-- yeah. And that's why so many people after an affair has been revealed, go, let's get over this fast. 

00:57:55
HELEN FISHER Uh-hmm. 

00:57:55
ELLYN BADER Can we get through this - 

00:57:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. 

00:57:55
ELLYN BADER - which, ah, doesn't happen quickly. 

00:57:55
Helen Fisher, Ph.D. 

00:57:55
HELEN FISHER I would like to add just a Darwinian evolutionary perspective. And, I mean, and start out with the, well, ah, a short story about a bluebirds. I mean, it was a, it was a bluebird couple and, uhm, and, uhm, uhm, and the anthropologist wanted to see what would happened with the male would off to get some grabs or something and the female were sitting at the, at the nest that they were building together. And he, he put the male stuff, ah, fake bluebird right next to the female, ah, while the male was away and the partner male came back to the nest and saw this other male next to the female attacked the dummy until it was all feathers and, and just fluffed off the branch and then he attacked the female and pulled out most of her tail feather so she would have a hard time flying. And she fled and they were never seen again and 2 days later he moved the new female in. So this is adultery, it's not just for the human animal, you take a look throughout nature and, ah, this no joke. And the reason it is no joke is because, you're tampering not only with the trust and other psychological cortical issues of the human animal but you are also tampering with their reproductive capacity. Uhm, y ou know, the man stands to be cockled in, ah, the female stands to lose, ah, support system and indeed from the Darwinian perspective, I mean, what Darwin said was if you have four children and I have no children, you live on and I die out. So the game of love matters and the game of forming pair bond and trusting each other matters. It matters for the future of your DNA and we don't take it likely, no species does. 

00:59:40
PETER PEARSON I think, I think the national inquirer, get holds to that bluebird story and it would spread like wildfire. Esther. 

00:59:45
Esther Perel, MA, LMFT 

00:59:45
ESTHER PEREL Well, uhm, I think that, ah, it was, ah, from you, Ellyn, that, uhm, there is not a single society where adultery does not exist, right? 

00:59:55
HELEN FISHER Right, now I've took in 42 of them and every single one of them, even where you can have your head chopped off for it, ah, it exist, everywhere in the world. 

01:00:05
ESTHER PEREL Right. So there are 8 countries still where women can be stoned or burned alive for being adulteress. It has been historically practice in universally condemned and so then the question that you're asking about why would somebody want to do that if the consequences are so dire may lead us to then really asked, it must be that sometimes people long and yearn for something that is so damn powerful that they're willing to risk losing everything for it. 

01:00:30
HELEN FISHER And I would-- ah, are you through? 

01:00:35
ESTHER PEREL It's the other way around sometimes as well so that betrayal is always a part of an infidelity but it is not often the motive. Maybe, the motive is mo-- often more on the side of longing and yearning and often, uhm, and what was described here about the kind of disconnection that takes place and this gradual infiltration of the parallel life and the gradual kind of disinvestment of that person is that very ti-- many times we go somewhere else not so much cuz we wanna leave the person that we are with but we want to live who we have become. And it's not so much another person that we're looking for but another self. 

01:01:15
HELEN FISHER And I would like to add, uhm, that's a very psychological perspective and totally good and I think this psychological and anthropological - 

01:01:20
JOHN GOTTMAN Oh, yes. 

01:01:20
HELEN FISHER - worked together but I'll like to add the Darwinian and it comes from something that John, you said during your speech that Glass, Shirley Glass was that? 

01:01:30
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:01:30
HELEN FISHER She said, you know, and it's a very important little. I just did a meta-analyses of adultery and it's on my website. It a-- of all-- ah, but anyway, they what-- one of the issue you pointed out was that when asked why you are adulteress, uhm, ah, 64%-- 54% of men and 30-- ah, 56% of and 34% of women said they were in a happy marriage or a very happy marriage so why is this, I mean, really why is this? So from a Darwinian-- and there is genetics to adultery and we can go into that at different time but, ah, bottom line is, there's got to have been sometime in our evolutionary past that there were some really productive payoffs to these sort of thing or we wouldn't have a, worldwide, ah, issue with it and so, you know, one of the theories that I have offered and others have offered to dialing back to the grasslands of Africa, 2 million years ago, male and female form a pair bond race, their babies have two children together but occasionally the male goes over the hill and copulate with somebody else and I mean, it has by chance, two extra children. And the female, ah, while he's away she goes and had some sex with somebody else and get some extra resources, ah, for the children that she already has and through millions of years of the literally genetic payoffs of, of adultery, ah, we've evolved into human animal what I call a dual reproductive strategy, a tremendous drive to pair up and raise our children as a team and also a, uhm, a predisposition, ah, adulteress on the side. Now, I'm not saying the predisvi-- predisposition are necessarily gonna drive you to adultery. I mean some people are predisposed to alcoholism as-- and they don't give, ah, and they give up drinking but the bottom line is when you see something that is so prevalent around the world, uhm, ah, when you see some of the genetics of that, uhm, prevalence, ah, you have to come up with evolutionary, uhm, speculative answers and, and that's the going one. 

01:03:35
JOHN GOTTMAN You know, uhm, before I met my wife, ah, I, I went with my parents to Israel and met, ah, whole branch of, ah, my mother's family that I never met before. There about 20 people that I met and they were really-- every single one of them was a jerk. And, ah, they're re-- they're really were, you know, I really dislike all of them and they were really nasty people and, and I was think-- and I had hadn't trial yet and I was thinking, the world does not need my gene pool. I mean, it's not gonna make the world better so I have a lot of trouble relating to this idea that we have this tremendous drive to reproduce and, and survive, have our genes survive. I mean, ah, it's been absolutely wonderful to be a father and, and have, ah, have a daughter who's really great person, really nice person. I've, I've love being a father. I can see the motivation for wanting to be a dad, wanting to be a mom but I understand this wanting to have your gene pool survive. I, I just-- I don't have any experience with that. 

01:04:45
HELEN FISHER If it is two, uhm, ah, anthropologist sort of divided in, into proximate mechanisms and ultimate mechanisms. Proximate mechanisms are what you think you want, what you say you want, what you really want as, as you have but all said. You know, you want excitement or something new, et cetera. Ultimate, ah, explanations are actually what happens and bottom line is every person in this room is the result of people who, had children. And, ah, through millions of years those that did, did not have children died out. And those that did have children, lived on. So it's not as much what you're thinking about whether you want them or not but the bottom line is the drive to have them evolve because those that didn't have that drive died out. 

01:05:40
PETER PEARSON So I actually have an extension question on this which is, ah, our, our profession is going more and more toward research from different fields, anthropology, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. But my question is this, when you're-- when the giving therapist is working with the given couple in their room in the given painful interaction, what are the limitations of research? If you bring it right down to one couple with one therapist and this couple was having intense pain, what are-- are there limitations to research to help that couple at that time in that situation? 

01:06:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I, I think research is a very, very slow process of plagiarizing information who know what they're doing. Ah, but, uhm - 

01:06:25
PETER PEARSON Thank you, John Gottman. 

01:06:30
JOHN GOTTMAN - it's slow, it's slow and it's, it a-- it a-- it accumulates very slowly and for it to be reliable and useful. It takes a long time and we need the intuition of clinicians. 

01:06:40
PETER PEARSON Uh-hmm. 

01:06:40
JOHN GOTTMAN We need practice based evidence because we're dealing with tough, very tough problems. 

01:06:50
PETER PEARSON Less you can tell. 

01:06:50
JOHN GOTTMAN I mean all of the, all of the research on couple's therapy, the average marital satisfaction of the clients is within half of, of standard deviation away from the mean. But I see couples who are six and seven standard deviation below the mean. 

01:07:05
PETER PEARSON Right. 

01:07:05
JOHN GOTTMAN So that literature is never useful, the research never useful. 

01:07:10
PETER PEARSON I, I really appreciate that coming from you John a lot. 

01:07:10
JOHN GOTTMAN It's very limited. It's very, very slow so we need both. We need to know what clinicians know and we need research as well to make sure that we're not, ah, assuming that we're right all the time. And so we can be prove the wrong as well. 

01:07:30
PETER PEARSON Good. 

01:07:30
ESTHER PEREL You know, uhm, I think that you said-- I love th question actually. It's, ah, uhm, it invites a lot of thinking, right? Uhm, you are in the room and here's my thought when you were talking with this. When you listen to a piece of Bach or Mozart, one of the beautiful thing is to listen to it interpreted by a number of different musicians. Nobody has ever wanted to say there is one right way to play Mozart. I think the beauty of therapy is to actually see a number of different musicians, artists, i.e., therapists, work with the same couple and be there and create a different interpretation of life, bring to people who are in suffering to a different place of beauty, to a different meaning of existence, and research which likes to become to scientific, uhm, has be-- had kind of become very popular at this moment and, uhm, and we like the concept of evidence based but so much of what happens between two people that is important is what is not visible. And how do we research that? So we do-- I read all the research, too, but when I sit in the room, I am really not thinking about research at all. I am thinking about two individuals. Let's talk about the crisis you asked before. Uhm, you know, the crisis of an affair is not a static thing. It is not the same on the night after as it is on the sight of the-- there's multiple crisis. The crisis of the person who is wondering how they're going to end the affair or the crisis of the person who realized through the affair that they actually really want to stay and in there primarily relationship, or the crisis of the person, uhm, who, uhm, realizes that, uhm, this is, ah, this is, this revelation that has just happened, uhm, was probably one of the most important things that happened in the relation. Be thrill is not only a dirty word, it sometimes-- it's the most powerful thing to shape up a rotten political system. You know, and but you don't know that in the moment. In the moment when you are in the-- so crisis 3 months later, the crisis a year later, the opportunities that maybe come from that and even 5 years later, people may still say it was our worst crisis but what came out of it was invaluable. The mea-- the word crisis is a flexible term not some static thing that has fallen on us and that is not so much to be seen in research. 

01:10:10
PETER PEARSON Yeah. 

01:10:15
[sil.] 

01:10:20
HELEN FISHER I'd like to defend some research. 

01:10:25
ELLYN BADER I got lousy... 

01:10:25
HELEN FISHER You wanna go? 

01:10:25
ESTHER PEREL I am more daring when I don't see you. 

01:10:30
ELLYN BADER Uhm , I'm sort of indirectly gonna talk about your question cuz I think one of the reasons we have like lots of people who show up for a panel on infidelity and why we all like to talk about it is because it's darn, messy, and there are no easy answers. And we-- you know, in our practices, you can have procedures for a lot of things you do. I mean, you can have a 24 hour cancellation policy and you can have, you know, you can have whether you see separately or you don't, or whatever it is but when you see an infidelity case, you never know what is gonna come out to and you never know from week to week, what is gonna be the new thing that, ah, that somebody discovered or the new lives or, I mean, and you're always challenge by couples like that to figure out where you stand, uhm, and it's-- and those moments when I make those decisions, I-- I'm not thinking about research, I'm, you know, I'm like drawing on every bit of clinical experience I have and every bit of knowledge I have about the two people in front of me and doing what I just hope is the best thing at the moment. 

01:11:35
HELEN FISHER Well, I'd like t o defend research. 

01:11:35
PETER PEARSON Oh, yes. Go. 

01:11:40
HELEN FISHER Probably a lot of people know that I and my colleagues put people who are madly in love and do a brain scanner and, uhm, ah, the most important thing I think that we've done is we put 15 people into the brain scanner who just been rejected in love. And, uhm, I-- my hypothesis was, ah, and I generally don't have a hypothesis, John, I've-- I was glad that you said that, uhm, uhm, ah, it was that, ah, love-- ah, romantic love was an addiction, ah, particularly, uhm, a wonderful addiction when it was going well and, ah, probably, a horrible addiction when it's going poorly. And indeed, uhm, we did find activity, in three brain regions linked with profound addiction. And I, I would hope that some therapist would take that research and other research into mind when they're dealing with the couple and expand their understanding of this, uhm, ah, ah, further than just your childhood which is very important and the politics of the relationship but into the world of addiction, ah, ah, chemical addiction. Ah, so I do think that research can expand the, the, the clinicians understanding of the situation. 

01:12:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Ah, I wanna say something about, ah, history. It is great book written by Marilyn Yalom called the History of the Wife and, ah, I think everybody should read it who's a couples therapist. And, ah, Marilyn Yalom is Irvin Yalom's wife and, you know, really terrific historian. And if you look at the history of marriage, committed relationship, it's undergone profound changes in less 600 years. So in the middle ages, you know, ah, a guy married when he was around 30, uhm, and he married a woman who's around 14 and he lived to be about 41 or two. So the marriage lasted, 10 to 12 years and then, she was widowed and, ah, and medieval guilds admitted widows into the guild so that really eventually Europe was being run entirely by widows. Ah, they were the end keepers, the blacksmiths, the millers, and so on, uhm, and the same thing was true for nobles were, you know, the husbands were knights and went on crusades, the women run everything. And, ah, so com-- compare marriages that lasted 12 years, ah, to today were marriages can last 60 years and, and the challenges that you have when a marriage last that long. You know in middle ages, people made fun of husbands who are in love with their wives. The luxurious husband was, was a source of mockery and punching duty shelves. They, they linked love and marriage. Marriage was about stability and property. Love was courtly, it was fleeting, you know, and now, since 1700, we have the concept of the companionate marriage that last decades and decades, and decades, right? There's, there's a whole new invention and, you know, it's, this, this fidelity and serving all this roles as lover, friend, father, mother, ah, and on and on. You know, all these different roles over the a long life course. That's a whole new thing and it's, ah, it, it's kinda hard to, to go back to biology and think about, you know, what's right, what was right? All of us is changing, historically, sociologically, and it's no wonder relationships are falling apart cuz they, they supposed to do so much for so long. 

01:15:35
ELLYN BADER Well, ah, and, and, you know, now we have in our primary relationship, the interdependency in all these areas that you're talking about and none of us ever grow up learning how to be in an interdependent relationship. I mean all our relationships are hierarchal and then all of a sudden, you're in a marriage and you're suppose to automatically know how to be, ah, successfully interdependent with somebody. 

01:16:00
HELEN FISHER Ah, I would even add that, uhm, I mean, I, I think it's been floating around in a lot of conversations but, you know, for millions of years, we've live in this little hunting together in societies and your partner was one of many people that you got nurturing from and, and education from and love from and attention from, et cetera, et cetera. And to, you know, to-- I mean this loss of local community and the focus on just the partner being everything as you say everything the most mysterious and also the most stable part of your life is something the human brain is not build for. 

01:16:30
PETER PEARSON Right, so... 

01:16:30
ELLYN BADER Uhm, one-- can I just have one? 

01:16:30
PETER PEARSON Yeah. 

01:16:30
ELLYN BADER Last summer, when were in Africa, we spent some time with, uhm, uhm, a Maasai warrior and he had 42 brothers and sisters and I said to him-- and you know, in multiple-- there were multiple wives and I said to him, you know what was is like each time a new wife came in to the family? And he said, "What do you mean in what was it like?" And I said... 

01:16:50
PETER PEARSON Because you're s asking about jealousy. 

01:16:55
ELLYN BADER Yeah, I asked exactly, I asked them about the jealousy factor and he said, "There was no jealousy because every time a new wife came in to the system, we had more resources. And so we were happy that our community had more resources." 

01:17:05
HELEN FISHER Well, well, on the other hand... 

01:17:10
PETER PEARSON That's one, that's one hell of reframing. 

01:17:10
HELEN FISHER Yeah, but, ah, ah, on the other hand, the husbands are really are obliged in pledging the society is to pay equal attention to each. So I happen to be doing some international radio on the BBC with the guy from Kenya and he had three wives so I said to him, I said, "Well, how many wives would you like to have?" And I was thinking that is he gonna say 10, is he gonna 25 and he leaned into his microphone and he said, "None." 

01:17:40
PETER PEARSON All right so.. 

01:17:40
HELEN FISHER There is some pressures there that this guy didn't tell you about. 

01:17:45
ELLYN BADER He was the one with the (inaudible ) with all the wives. It was his father. 

01:17:48
PETER PEARSON So, so I have a question when you talk, when we talk about how messy it is in the-- how messy it is in the office? There's one more variable which is, ah, most therapist, you know, we have some general idea about countered transference going on in a case or situation and, you know, we try to minimize the effect of negative countertransference but my question is this, do you think ash-- a therapist should aspire to be valued neutral when they work with a case of infidelity. Should they hang up their judgments, put those judgments in the waiting room, although, it's literally impossible to do that. You think they should aspire to be valued neutral when working with infidelity. Who? I like that question. 

01:18:40
ESTHER PEREL Okay, I will start. Uhm, no, because I think that, you know, each of us could probably inhabit the space of each other and we-- let's say the same to say some of two but each of us is trying to add something to the conversation. Uhm, I think that every therapist is value laden. We come as, ah, system of meanings to therapy. We have an idea. I think one of the danger if I may see of the couples therapy is that we seem to have become the priest of what is healthy and good. We've taken over the morality that the church has left behind sometimes and in that sense, it is really care-- I would like to be careful to not think that I know what is good of a relationship, what is healthy, who should be staying together and who should not, and a good humility will serve me well. Then I sit in front of the infidelity and I-- my first question is to try to understand what does this mean for them? I worked across cultures and not in every culture is a the same trauma, not because the hurt is different but because the meaning associated to the hurt is different in the same way that for these men, your question about jealousy isn't part of his register. And so I, I, I, I try to see, you know, is-- what do these people experience this event, this crisis in their life to be and it's not one but already at least two people in front of me. Now, depending on the story, I may be disgusted, jealous, envious, worried about my on marriage, clear about the tenaciousness of relationships, worried about my age, identifying with the person who had affair, identifying out other times with the person because I think, you know, I see this man recently and he treats his wife really awful, awful for so many years. She finally meet somebody who is actually treating here with respect. She may actually master the strength to leave this man and he's cursing her out in the office and I'm thinking to myself, you know, it says to her, I at least, I'm not a slot and I haven't-- and I'm thinking but then I said, maybe you then because nobody wants to be with you. You know, you're not such a nice person and I'm thinking be thrilled comes in many forms, you know. 

01:21:05
PETER PEARSON Right, that's right. 

01:21:05
ELLYN BADER Who has the superiority of evil here? 

01:21:10
PETER PEARSON That's right, it's true. 

01:21:10
ELLYN BADER Or who has the superiority of victimhood? 

01:21:10
PETER PEARSON It's a good point. 

01:21:10
ELLYN BADER At other times I am in touch with the person who is betrayed because I'm thinking for god sake. At other times, I'm thinking, you know, the story of this couple doesn't start with the affair. Now, you're crying but I don't know who you were 5 years before so it's layer upon layer and all I try to do is to in touch and checking myself at every time in talking with a lot of other colleagues when it gets complicated. It's not often to be done just alone. 

01:21:45
[sil.] 

01:21:50
PETER PEARSON Anybody else on as-- on aspiring to be valued neutral? Anyone else wanna add what you think about therapist being... 

01:21:55
JOHN GOTTMAN Well, you know, one of-- one of the thing that, ah, that I keep thinking about is, ah, research on social epidemiology, ah, which, which is about 40, 45 years old. Uhm, you know, really discovered the amazing health benefits and longevity benefits, uhm, uhm, well being benefits, mental health as well as physical health benefits of a relationship, normally marriages but friendships as well where there's commitment, where there's love, where there's understanding, where there's caring and loyalty, ah, I'm-- there, there is an absolute, uhm, there, there's an absolute in terms of what children need, uhm, you know, from a family and what makes children thrive. And there's an absolute about what you get from relationships and appears to be really true across the entire planet, it's cross culturally true that in cultures where there is community, where is... 

01:23:00
PETER PEARSON Ah, let, let me jumped in, ah, you're talking about whether or not that should be valued neutral or... 

01:23:05
JOHN GOTTMAN Well, what I'm saying is that there is a value-- there are values that are absolute that, uhm, it's not relative. Uhm, their-- in, in, in the family, where there's no jealousy and, you know, the new wife is viewed as a resource, they're able to do something that is pretty amazing. They're really able to create community and support one another and we know that people who are alone and lonely die early everywhere in the planet. And that love-- the ability to really have love, to, to love, not only receive love but to love and sustain loyalty and commitment is health giving. And, and logivity producing, quite amazing. Uhm, you know, it's a-- you live an average of 10 to 15 years longer. If you're in a loving relationship that's stable, ah, quite a remarkable effect, not a small effect and, ah, and the, the effects on the immune system that been traced very well, we know what mechanisms are. So they're really, you know, things aren't relative. Now, ah, somebody who can't do that, some-- somebody who can't make a relationship work, uhm, you know, where there's concealment and, ah, and the absence of loyalty, the absence of commitment and love, that's a sad thing. It's a, it, it really, you know, it was pretty universally set. And you know, I think, I think Esther is right - 

01:24:40
PETER PEARSON Sir, sir, Sir John, sir... 

01:24:40
JOHN GOTTMAN - there are no good guys or bad guys on this thing. You know, there aren't horns and tails on people but it's always sad when a relationship can't make that happen. 

01:24:45
PETER PEARSON Ellyn-- Helen, do you have any comments on value neutral as therapist? 

01:24:50
HELEN FISHER No, I like to get on to some of the nitty-gritty - 

01:24:55
PETER PEARSON Okay. 

01:24:55
HELEN FISHER - and work goes on in therapy process. 

01:24:55
PETER PEARSON Yeah. 

01:24:55
ESTHER PEREL I would like to - 

01:24:55
PETER PEARSON Go ahead. 

01:24:55
ESTHER PEREL - to say one small thing on the value thing. I think that one of the-- there are a few key values that, ah, that, that we are questioning always when we do a couple step, people that are particularly stronger when you work with infidelity. And they have to do with your beliefs and your values as it pertains monogamy and, ah, mandate or the absoluteness of the moral categorical of monogamy is one of them. The second one is your belief in the, in the right of the individual happiness at the expense of others, the degree to which you think that, you know, when you place the individual at center, you have a different response to what they have done and the consequences that places to another, and versus the degree to which you think the person should their individual happiness because of the consequences it has on others. And those values really come to the forefront in full blown, ah, light in-- when you work with infidelity more than others. 

01:25:55
JOHN GOTTMAN But when you work with gay couples, you have to realize that McWhirter and Mattison's classic study found that there was no gay-male relationship that had lasted longer than 35 years that was monogamous. They were all non-monogamous and they been able to manage it with without deception, without cruelty. So, you know, it all depends on what you're working with, you know, what you, what kind of relationship your working with. 

01:26:25
ESTHER PEREL Somebody yesterday asked for us to actually be more inclusive on the gay and lesbian situation, I think that this is really one area were straight couples have everything to learn from gay couples. 

01:26:35
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, that's right. Yeah, sexes in other area. 

01:26:40
ESTHER PEREL So I could linked on that one but it's... 

01:26:40
PETER PEARSON Okay, here-- all right, so here, here's the question which is often when therapists go to conferences, they learn about infidelity. We have speaker say, you know, "Here's the theory, here's what we think is behind that, you know, here some possible ways to look at it, here's some possible interventions." And it's taught almost as though therapist are interchangeable parts, you know, that they can apply whatever the hell is being taught we-- relatively skillfully, relatively easily. Ah, my question is this, ah, do you think there such a thing as that portraits of a therapist that make them especially better in working with infidelity? 

01:27:20
ELLYN BADER Yeah, the ability to manage a lot of complexity and, ah, I mean, and of this-- what I'm about to say is not a slur on beginning therapist but when I'm supervising cases and I-- many times with a newer or younger beginning therapist, what I find is they want, they, they collude with the person who wants to get over the infidelity quickly or not talk about this as much in the office because as soon as you get into it, it's complex and it's messy. And, you know, all the things I was saying before, it's not easy when you have to deal with, ah, you know, so-- I mean, a recent situation where the couple where, uhm, the affair is over in one sense but it's not over in his mind, it's not over in his body, it's not over in what he longs for in his memory, what he longs for to be sharing with the woman which was actually a professional collaboration and, uhm, in order to finish processing this. I mean, this is a couple who needed to be able to talk about the fact that it wasn't for him in those ways and there were some ways he was gonna have to finish it that were gonna be uncomfortable for her. And, you know, helping them stay in that dynamic tension till they could figure out what was gonna work for the two of them is not, you know, and sometimes, you-- I can sit there and my stomach will be tight. Or I'll be going, "Oh, shit. What am I gonna do next? I don't know." 

01:28:45
ESTHER PEREL And I, I think this is super important that I would add to that the word patience. This is not a seven step thing. This is not a 10 session thing. This is sometimes one or 2 years of a person gradually figuring it out, working it out, maybe ending it without ever revealing it and letting the secret turn into a memory and reconnecting with their partner. But it's really is, is, uhm, not wanting to rush it for somebody to make a decision, uhm, so that it can be neat and we need to modulate our impatience at those moment. And sometimes people come back week after week to repeat the same, you know, with these person I feel like that and we this person I feel like that. And you'll-- you take the triangle and you turn it into it is part of you and then you take the triangle and you go back to the past and then you'd say, "Man, you have every geometry of this triangle possible." And, you know, and then one day, life does something. Sometimes, it isn't even just the person finally came to, life kicks something, something, something of hell, it's a child, a job, an employment, in politics, you know, economy, whatever. 

01:29:55
ELLYN BADER Or both women say, you're out of here. 

01:29:55
ESTHER PEREL That's right. You know, and then, that's-- and then the movement comes in. So patience and complexity I think. 

01:30:05
JOHN GOTTMAN Well, I think one thing, it's important to realize is actually, the prognosis is very positive so, ah, in, in Andy Christensen's research and, ah, and Atkins work, the, ah, the curve is steeper but they actually couples who have affairs wind up in the same place at the end of their therapy. The same thing was true for Don Baucom's research. So now that those studies have been done, we know it's really helpful. You really can rebuild the relationship, uhm, and there's a lot of attachment that is invisible and when people come back, you know, I rate someone at only 11% of affairs actually become relationships. I don't remember where I read this but I'm trying to remem-- remember it but there are very few affairs that actually progress toward relationships so there is this invisibility of attachment, ah, that I think creates, ah, a, a very optimistic prognosis if the people are willing to work on it. Yes, it's complex, very complex. 

01:31:05
PETER PEARSON That could actually be a very reassuring... 

01:31:05
UNKNOWN It also creates motivation. 

01:31:10
PETER PEARSON That could actually be a very reassuring statistics for couples - 

01:31:10
JOHN GOTTMAN I think that, too. 

01:31:10
PETER PEARSON - to just tell them, there's a 90% chance, this, this affair is not going to end up in a relationship. 

01:31:20
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:31:20
PETER PEARSON God, those are amazing odds. 

01:31:20
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:31:20
ELLYN BADER But I think, I think one thing that I see that goes along with what John is saying is that, ah, when an affair is revealed in a couple, the motivation at least, ah, often becomes very high to do the therapy work, ah, whereas in some other couples you got to work to create the motivation. 

01:31:40
JOHN GOTTMAN Uh-hmm, that's a good point. 

01:31:45
PETER PEARSON Is, is there- this, this is my last question for the panel and people can ask questions here. Other than, what you've already expressed, are there any other personal or professional challenges that, you know, particular bedevil you and working with, ah, infidelity situations. 

01:32:05
[sil.] 

01:32:15
PETER PEARSON I am glad I get to ask this question. 

01:32:15
ESTHER PEREL What's the most challenging, right? No, these are great questions. These are great question. Go Ellyn. 

01:32:20
ELLYN BADER No, I was, ah... 

01:32:20
ESTHER PEREL Go John. 

01:32:25
ELLYN BADER Well, you know, I, I, I will tell you where my mind went. I went to, ah, couple different places but one of them was, uhm, the issue of managing secrets and, you know, I was orig-- and, and also well, the issue of managing secrets in that. You know, I was originally, trained you'd never hold a secret. Then I learned (inaudible ) open secret's policy and then I tried using the open secrets policy and then I found my own policy which I like better than, ah, either of those but it's not always a good one so, I mean, I-- well, you know, my-- what I, what I do a lot of time but I think this is where a good diagnosis comes to play. What I do a lot of the time is I asked the couple to decide so I put it out very clearly to them, ah, what do you want our confidentiality policy for the three of us to be so when I met with you individuality, I would prefer to know, I would prefer that, ah, when either of you told me it could be confidential but I want you truly decide and so sometimes that brings a lot of stuff out pretty quickly when one person is saying, you know, "I want it confidential." And the other one says, "I don't want you to see if its confidential." Uhm, so that's my policy a lot of the time but then other time I know I'm dealing with somebody who's really slippery and I wanted be able to see them and confront them, and work with them and then I go back to the open-- you know, so I mean, it's an issue that I have not a hundred percent resolved. 

01:34:00
JOHN GOTTMAN I think being lied to is the, the most upsetting part of this, you know, where you do therapy and then, you get an email from one of the people says, you know, I would seeing the other person or, you know, I actually met somebody else and started but within in therapy so I, I was managing all these relationships and that-- that's depressing. That's why I think the private investigator is-- they have, they have a nice idea. I-- private investigator fund. 

01:34:30
ELLYN BADER Hey, I got to-- I got to tell you another one. I, I, I actually, I love this. This-- okay, but no, but this is related to the private investigator. This was a woman in a couple who I thought did one of the more brilliant things I've ever seen a woman in this situation because her husband though, ah, uhm, was begging her to be in therapy with him, uhm, an affair had been revealed and he was saying, you know, please, please, please, don't divorce me. I wanna be in therapy. And she couldn't decide cuz she didn't really trust him so she came back into this next session and she said, "I have a solution. I will be in therapy with you for the next year or however long it takes but if I find out that you're lying to me and we sign a contract. I get 70% of our asset and you get 30." 

01:35:15
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah, well that's the, that's actually, ah, that's actually, ah, a very common part of game theory is to have a very high cost for subsequent betrayals and a contract like that works very well. 

01:35:35
ESTHER PEREL So, uhm, I think that, ah, definitely the, you know, I work the whole time and I didn't know what was what. That's a big one. I definitely, ah, which is why I also have an open secret policy. The question about when, you know, the complexities of managing the se-- but then I thought, you know, very quickly, you know, can-- if you pass your roller decks right in front of you, what are some of the things that are really grappling. Some, you know, and I thought of a situation where a woman was in complete free flow descent. And all I could think every week is when is her partner finally gonna find out because nothing will stop her until he knows. And then, the terror will kick in and then, she'll get jolted back to reality and, and I just couldn't do anything so that's an example when you just see self destruction in front of you and you, you know, uhm, you, you pretty much know that only the, the di-- the discovery on the part of the partner will do something. It's another one that is very difficult for me, sometimes is when I try to stop somebody from going into the complete, uhm, wanting to know all the details and, and, just wanting to flood themselves with, with complete traumatizing material and I'm not able to really tell them and, and, and slow them down and sued them and reassure them that this is not the way that they will find any safety stability or trust back. That's another one and then another one, is when people decide that because, you have cheated on me, I am now entitled to know everything about you and I am now deciding that intimacy is a surveillance system. You know, and I find totalitarian regime repugnant and so two-way within an intimate couple. That's a value system as you may have heard. So those are like three where the, the real challenges of the, of the-- you know, when that if you owe everything, you have no right to any, you know, you have no right to any personal boundaries anymore because at this point, you know, you are-- you belong to me and I have a right and all of this concept of human rights suddenly entering there with a kind of, uhm, real more superiority. I have a hard time sometimes. Also, the one that came up is when a person, uhm, won't forgive even though they really want to forgive because if they were to forgive, it would be a kind of absolution that whatever you did wasn't that bad. So they will stick it to themselves for the rest of their life just so that the other will not have descent night. That kind of, you know, uhm, what did you call it, the zero sum game of betrayal that notion, that, you know, I'll starve myself but you won't be able to eat in peace as if, as if I'm getting to you kind of thing. And, and some couples will stay together afterwards but it's an absolute jail. 

01:38:25
JOHN GOTTMAN Yeah. 

01:38:30
ESTHER PEREL Every fi-- everything you do I remind you, you know, you have used up your quota for the rest of your life, it talk about contempt. That is-- so they are together. I don't know if that's a successful therapy but you do it, right? 

01:38:40
PETER PEARSON No, I wouldn't think so. 

01:38:40
ESTHER PEREL They are together but men, the contempt and the-- oh, you know, I've got you now like that. Those ones really, I have to do a lot of breathing. 

01:38:50
ELLYN BADER They hurt your stomach. 

01:38:55
HELEN FISHER Well, one of the problems of course is that with the memory system, I mean, ah, you know, ah, there's a lot of, uhm, estrogen receptors in the hippocampus, ah, with memory, uhm, linked with memory and women do remember. They remember for 50 years. They remember much more than men do probably for good evolutionary reasons because they've had life's hardest job of any animal on the planet which is raising tiny helpless babies for many, many years. And so they remember and of course, as we talk with each other, we, we count what he did and what he didn't do. We're creating the memory trail that goes on and on and, ah, it is a bit of a, gender difference. Ah... 

01:39:35
ELLYN BADER It's a very... 

01:39:35
HELEN FISHER And, and, and it's adaptive, ah, sometime to forget. 

01:39:40
PETER PEARSON Do we, do we have any questions? Are there any questions from out here, two or three people can raise their hand, ask a question and we can see if maybe the questions are grouped in a, in a short period of time. Ah, go ahead that out. 

01:39:55
UNKNOWN Yes, can you speak about cybersex and, you know, pornography on the internet? 

01:40:00
PETER PEARSON Okay, so repeat your question again. 

01:40:05
UNKNOWN Ah, speak-- can you speak about cyber, internet pornography, uhm, affairs online. 

01:40:15
ESTHER PEREL Uh-hmm. 

01:40:15
PETER PEARSON And could you do that in 30 seconds? 

01:40:20
HELEN FISHER I think it depends on what... 

01:40:20
PETER PEARSON More question on cybersex. 

01:40:20
ELLYN BADER Yeah, get, get a few more so we know it. 

01:40:25
ESTHER PEREL Let's get, okay. So let's remember them. 

01:40:30
UNKNOWN Oh, I don't have a question on cybersex. I have a question for Helen Fisher. 

01:40:35
HELEN FISHER Where is she? 

01:40:35
PETER PEARSON Well, just ask her. 

01:40:35
UNKNOWN Oh, okay. Hi, Dr. Fisher. 

01:40:40
HELEN FISHER Hello. 

01:40:40
UNKNOWN I practice evolutionary psychology psychotherapy - 

01:40:40
HELEN FISHER Oh, interesting. 

01:40:40
UNKNOWN - couples therapy so that's, that's basically all I do so everything you talk about that's what I-- from the model that I practice. Uhm, I sleep with Donald Simon's book under my pillow. Now having said that, do you think that it is a value to talk about deregulation in the dopamine, ah, when people are having affairs. Do you think it's important like the Willem research from Sweden where you see that there are some men who a tweak in the allyl of manufacturing vasopressin that these men are going to be predisposed to having marital discord and possible affairs. I discuss this with my couples.... 

01:41:20
ESTHER PEREL The question, the question, the question. 

01:41:25
UNKNOWN Is it valuable? 

01:41:25
HELEN FISHER Uh-hmm. I mean, I mean just to back up to explain what she's talking about, it's a, it's a wonderful, it's a fascinating study in 2008 by the first author is Willem. And, uhm, they have 552 men in Sweden and look at a gene in the vasopressin system and men who had two copies of that gene were far more likely to, ah, have a very unstable marriage. If you had one copy of the gene, you had a more stable marriage and if you had no copies of the gene, you have the most stable marriage. And it's the beginning of the understanding of some of the biology that goes under these predispositions for, ah, adultery or making solid pair bonds but, you know, to answer your question, I'm not the right person. I'm so fascinated with the fact that everybody has talked about-- talking about the affect as opposed to the content and, uhm, I have found with various couples that I-- that have come to me, they were actually interested in that data. They actually wanted the research, uhm, but I can't say because I'm not a therapist whether that's terribly affective, ah, for most couples. 

01:42:30
UNKNOWN Any other? 

01:42:30
ESTHER PEREL Yeah, we're gonna write them down and then collect a few. 

01:42:35
PETER PEARSON We only had about 6 minutes. 

01:42:35
ESTHER PEREL Okay. 

01:42:35
HELEN FISHER We didn't answer... 

01:42:40
UNKNOWN Yes, you had touchdown the issue of a polyamory when you talked about gay men and, uhm, the Kenyan men and I wondered if, uhm, you think that, polyamory is a cultural construct or a cognitive, uhm, construct that maybe people can shift into and I wondered if it's been your practices, you'd ever vi-- seen people explored that after the revelation of a n affair. 

01:43:00
PETER PEARSON Oh, one more question. 

01:43:00
ESTHER PEREL Great question. 

01:43:00
UNKNOWN Anybody else on this side? 

01:43:05
PETER PEARSON All right. Where? Yeah. 

01:43:10
UNKNOWN This one right here. 

01:43:10
ELLYN BADER Go ahead. 

01:43:10
PETER PEARSON So one more question and then you can figure out how you wanna answer them. 

01:43:15
HELEN FISHER Ah, about polyamory. Ah, the polyamory community, uhm, apparently likes me and they like me because I think we've evolved through distinctly different brain systems from mating and reproduction, the sex drive, feelings of romantic love and feelings of attachment. And they seem, and they, they feel that, uhm, you know, they wanna sustain their deep attachment for their long term partner. And also have the intense romance for somebody else and they have, ah, honest agreement with each other. They've-- they, they make a list of what you can and can't do, uhm, and they, you know, now, uhm, my response to that is first of all, they try to put under the cover the fact that there's enormous amount of jealousy. The human animal is a jealous animal. Now they seem to be able either override that but they spend an enormous amount of time after the weekend talking about their bad feelings. So it's not as successful as they say it is and, ah, maybe for some people this can work but vast majority of human beings it's not gonna work cuz we got a huge brain system for jealousy also. 

01:44:20
ELLYN BADER Well, uhm, for me that polyamorous couples that I've seen who make it work are actually the ones with the highest levels of differentiation because they do have to process so much and they do repair but they do develop real cla-- clarity. So I think for a lots of people that won't work and then, there are those who it works very well for. 

01:44:40
UNKNOWN Uhm... 

01:44:40
ESTHER PEREL So... 

01:44:40
UNKNOWN Happiest, happiest couple-- can I ask one question? 

01:44:45
PETER PEARSON Here's the question, this will be the last question. 

01:44:45
UNKNOWN Can I ask one ques... 

01:44:50
ESTHER PEREL We also want to-- she wants cybersex. 

01:44:50
PETER PEARSON And cybersex. 

01:44:55
ESTHER PEREL Okay, let me, let me, ah, I'll say one sentence on the polyamory and then cyber. Though your question specifically is, are we willing to take on the possibility of a polyamorous relationship as part of a resolution of a working through of couple that comes in originally around infidelity, that's how I understood your question, yes or no? Whatever, so but we need to link it to the infidelity thing. I think that, uhm, probably the, the most succinct way of saying it is this there isn't one mother fits all. For anyone who says the polyamorous doesn't work, the 50% divorce are mostly not polyamorous and they don't seem to work that will either. You know, I think the, the, the piling up of expectations that John talked about is far more-- uhm, is no different in a way in a polyamorous relationship than it can be in a monogamous relationship. It's still is a different, it's a different set expectations but the piling up is taking place. Anyway, what I would say is that as we are going to evolve, my sense is that monogamy is the next frontier. It will no longer just be able to be assumed, it will become part of negotiation. The same way that we couldn't conceive a premarital sex and it is now a given and we couldn't conceive of homosexuality out of the DSM. And with family and children and married and all like monogamy will be the next discussion for modern love because we just live too long and we want it with one but we also want all the individual list stuff that our western society has put on us and there aren't many monos left. Cybersex, there's a wonderful book. It's Aaron Ben-Ze'ev who is a philosopher of emotion, who wrote a book called Love Online. I highly recommend it because it is a different perspective than what we tend to always talk about. For example, he has one of the most interesting description of intimacy online and why it often is actually is more intimate. But he looks at it by talking about how on the one hand, it is more intimate and less stable. It is more intimate because you reveal a lot more things much sooner outside of a context, it is much less stable because it could also disappear at the same time. And in the book, he gives it to you in a real kind of dialectic way. What you have and what you don't have coexisting at the same time but, uhm, and what he's looking up specifically are affairs online not sex online, love online and I think that is-- it's an important thing to separate. Sex online is one kind of experience, love online is whole other kind of experience. You know, this is an imaginary fictitious story between two fictitious people who experience a real emotion. It's the keys that was never given but everything inside of you is as if it took place. That virtual cyberspace is a whole new reality. We haven't yet began to get, get a grasp on. 

01:48:05
HELEN FISHER And I think it's really part of what, uhm, demographers are calling the marrie-- the, ah, the marriage revolution. And in fact, they've even said that, it's, ah, it's, ah, gonn a have a more powerful effect on the future than the industrial revolution because what we're really doing is shedding 10,000 years of the agrarian tradition and, ah, all of the belief systems that go a long within. In fact, I would even say removing forward to the kinds of relationships that we may have had, uhm, million years ago in which there is more autonomy between the sexes, ah, all kinds of new things there have been. So it's a wonderful time to be a part of this, uhm, motion forward. I mean it's a, it's a dramatic change in, in human affairs. 

01:48:45
PETER PEARSON Thank you Helen for wrapping it up on such a great note and thank you all for a great fast hour of discussion. Thank you all. Yes, you guys rock.
