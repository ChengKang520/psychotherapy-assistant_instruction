Mindfulness-Based CBT Group 

00:01:00
AMY MCCLOUD I'm Dr Amy McCloud from Argentina University, Atlanta and today I'm going to be speaking with Dr Allison Spargo and Dr. Shane Blasko about facilitating a mindfulness-Based CBT Group with an adult client population. Allison, Shane welcome. Thank you for joining us today. Umm… do wanna start out by just telling us a little bit about what we're gonna be seeing on today's video?. 

00:01:20
ALLISON SPARGO Absolutely. So today, you're going to see a demonstration on how to infuse mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy in a group with adults. 

00:01:30
AMY MCCLOUD Okay, great, thanks. For some of our viewers who maybe a little bit less familiar, would you mind just uh… starting out with the definition of what is mindfulness and how does that fit with CBT? 

00:01:35
SHANE BLASKO Absolutely. So mindfulness is basically being present in the moment on purpose, without judgment. 

00:01:50
AMY MCCLOUD Okay and so I'm hearing being in the moment, non judgmental, how does that fill with CBT?. 

00:01:55
ALLISON SPARGO That's a great question. So CBT or Cognitive behavioral therapy, you might remember as more of a traditional approach of addressing thoughts, maybe even labeling them as maladaptive thoughts and exploring how those thoughts might impact umm… behaviors or emotions. And so infusing mindfulness with CBT takes that maladaptive word out and it takes some of the umm… instances of trying to create change away from what is more traditionally CBT. And so how this group will look is that we are going to be introducing umm… that nonjudgmental awareness of our thoughts and that not judgmental awareness of how our thoughts might be impacting our emotional responses and our behavioral responses and rather than trying to change our thought patterns. We're just gonna say, "Hey, this is a thought," and rather than trying to change our emotional response and just say, "Wow, when this thought happened, this was my emotional response." And so to explore the patterns but not necessarily create uh… uh… a purposeful change rather than just creating awareness. 

00:02:55
AMY MCCLOUD Okay, so awareness increased insight, I hear a nonjudgmental, seems very here now. Okay, great. Umm… so it might be quite different than what some group members are used umm… different approach to counseling. How do you prepare them for participating in a mindfulness based group? 

00:03:10
ALLISON SPARGO Umm… absolutely so we spent a lot of time… and somebody who prepares, who over prepares in a lot of ways. Umm… so I have pretty much a stack of information to come to this group with. So we created a definition of mindfulness, what are mindfulness-based CBT Group might look like. Umm… so we came in with a very, you know, like you would with any group. So we came in with a general idea of the group to present to the participants and from there we came also prepared with umm… activities, with process questions, with ways to move the material outside of the group and into the real world for our participants. We came in with umm… we came in prepared to assist in group cohesion, to manage group conflict, all of those different stages that you might experience, in a group we came in prepared for it. And I mention a stack, I truly did have a stack of information. So that umm… there wouldn't really be a lot of dead time so of course, you know, if there is silence and the group is using that silence that we're not gonna, we're not gonna interrupt that but I had a lot of information. We had a lot of information about, how to move… how to teach something about mindfulness and how to use that mindfulness CBT. 

00:04:25
AMY MCCLOUD Okay, so I'm hearing that umm… you're prepared a lot… 

00:04:25
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

00:04:25
AMY MCCLOUD Umm… which is a good strategy, I mean, particularly if something's new for beginner counselor, maybe starting out. Umm… so you're prepared a lot and you almost have like a psycho-educational piece to introduce the group to what is mindfulness sort of like you just did here. Okay, and then you lead them through some structured activities but also I'm hearing, there are some flexibility to allow the group to kind of uh… just flow and take over on its own. 

00:04:50
ALLISON SPARGO Absolutely, yes. Umm… like I said, we had a lot of, a lot of material prepared and you'll notice that in these groups, they took this material we presented and that like you said, it was a psycho-educational group that was the structure of it and so we presented the material, we taught kind of a lesson and then the process even though we had umm… many, many different types of activities or more questions to get the process going, they really just took it. And they took ownership of this group and you'll be, you'll be seeing that soon. 

00:05:15
AMY MCCLOUD Okay, great. I'm really looking forward to seeing that. Umm… I'm just thinking so as a counselor working in either a busy outpatient setting or maybe even a umm… somewhat chaotic in-patient mental health setting. How do, as a facilitator, do you get in the place where you're able to come into the room and be fully present, be in the here now and effectively facilitate mindfulness based group? 

00:05:35
SHANE BLASKO Basically by using, some of the same skills that we're teaching the group members in this type of group. We use some of the techniques ourselves. So we'll use umm… mindfulness based techniques, Allison and myself both practice umm… mindfulness techniques. So we'll use umm… focused mindfulness meditation. I myself will do some grounding. Umm… techniques before I do whether it's individual counseling or group counseling. 

00:06:05
AMY MCCLOUD Okay, kind of get yourself in the right… 

00:06:05
SHANE BLASKO Get yourself focused, grounded, absolutely. 

00:06:10
AMY MCCLOUD That sounds like a really useful suggestion and what about for the group members? So anytime you're asking a group over to try something new, it involves a little bit of vulnerability in taking a risk. What things do you put in place to create that safe group atmosphere? 

00:06:25
SHANE BLASKO Well, we spoke with this group about a couple of things. We talked to them about establishing a sense of safety with the group members. We talked about umm… a shared sense of umm… agreement about new judgments, umm… about not making comparisons, not only with each other but also we'd talk about not making comparisons umm… with themselves. Again it's new judgments about themselves and each other and also a third component that can be really important is umm… about accepting things for the way they are as opposed to umm… making assumptions about the way things should be. Umm… and those three ground rules can be really helpful, not just for group members for establishing safety that actually, they can be really helpful for all of us umm… in life. 

00:07:15
AMY MCCLOUD Sure. 

00:07:15
SHANE BLASKO Yeah. 

00:07:15
AMY MCCLOUD It's kind of a big shift in the way that we're generally socialized to think. 

00:07:20
SHANE BLASKO Absolutely. 

00:07:20
AMY MCCLOUD It's kind of like acceptance. 

00:07:20
SHANE BLASKO Yeah. 

00:07:20
AMY MCCLOUD Okay, I imagine that's hard for some facilitators and group members at first. 

00:07:25
SHANE BLASKO Oh, they can be hard for facilitators, even after we've been practicing those for a while. 

00:07:30
AMY MCCLOUD Sure but I guess that it all comes back to the self acceptance, right? 

00:07:35
SHANE BLASKO Absolutely. 

00:07:35
AMY MCCLOUD It's the struggling you get through it and… 

00:07:35
SHANE BLASKO Yeah. 

00:07:35
AMY MCCLOUD And, just accepting it is what it is kind of… 

00:07:40
SHANE BLASKO Yes. 

00:07:40
AMY MCCLOUD Okay, great. Well, would mind giving us a lead into what we're about to see? Kind of set up uh… the group that we're going to view. 

00:07:45
ALLISON SPARGO Absolutely. So we're gonna start out with the first two sessions. So you'll notice umm… that there are several participants, adult participants with a great amount of diversity and umm… as far as what you're gonna see in the first session, we're gonna do, what's called a body scan. That's pretty typical in a mindfulness, umm… psycho-educational type experience, just start with the mindfulness of bodily sensations. So that's what we're gonna start with our first session. And we will do that activity and we will also umm… spend sometime processing what the group members have learned out of becoming mindfulness, becoming mindful of their bodily sensations. And then in the second session, we're going to spend the time using mindfulness of thoughts and what that means is, you know, we're gonna build on the experience. I'll talk a little bit about what it's like to have of mindfulness or an awareness of their bodily sensations, what their thought process was, as far as man, and I don't realize I've heard here or they're kind of type, you know, like that and those types of things and so in the second session, we're gonna explore where our thoughts gonna actually and then also umm… what kind of automatic judgment, they might have had, as a result of where their thoughts went. Umm… you'll see also some of the group members talk about being in comfortable places and uncomfortable places, umm… and then we'll talk just briefly about where to move forward, as a summary or a conclusion to that second group session. How we're gonna take that information and move it forward to mindfulness of feelings. 

00:09:10
AMY MCCLOUD Okay, great. Thanks. And you mentioned there was a diverse group membership, can you tell us about some of the cultural considerations?. 

00:09:20
ALLISON SPARGO Absolutely. So umm… Shane and I were very uh… particular about the types of umm… cultural considerations that we invited into the group. Umm… we live in Atlanta. So we have uh… tremendous amount of diversity available to us. So we were looking for group members, of course, we scream to them. Umm… we were looking for group members who would not only meet the criteria for, you know, this type of group, this type of psycho-educational group but we wanted to demonstrate for our viewers umm… what this could look like with umm… white males, white females, African-American females and African-American males older and younger. Umm… all sorts of different exterior cultural differences but also you'll hear that they're talking about different thought processes and different emotional reactions and so that we'll also exchanged some information about the diversity of how we're all different inside, even if we look similar, there's a difference as the way that we perceive our world around us. 

00:10:15
AMY MCCLOUD Okay, so talking about uh… the visible cultural identities but you're certainly more obvious umm… and than also going a little deeper layer and talking about those cultural identities that are sometimes unseen but, you know, maybe equally as important to the group process. Okay, great. Thank you, let's take a look. 

00:10:30
ALLISON SPARGO Good Morning, everybody. 

00:10:30
UNKNOWN Good morning. 

00:10:35
Establishing purpose of the group. 

00:10:35
ALLISON SPARGO Thank you so much for attending our mindfulness in CBT group. Umm… we're going to spend some time talking this morning introducing ourselves talking a little bit about what mindfulness is, going through the structure and some of the goals of our particular group and then also practicing some of the things that we're gonna be learning this morning. Umm… our group has four different sessions and we'll be talking a bit about those, but let's start with some introductions. My name is Dr Allison Spargo and so I'm one of your group leaders, I'll be working with you through these activities and these exercises and these group sessions and my co-leader. 

00:11:05
SHANE BLASKO Hi, I'm Dr. Shane Blasko. 

00:11:10
ALLISON SPARGO So let's find just a minute or two and you can, you know, give each of us your name and anything that you might want us to know about you in, in our sessions. Awesome. Well, thank you guys so much this is uh… a type of group where you will be able to use the information that we're gonna that we're gonna learn as individuals and maybe apply it to different counseling settings or other settings umm… but our group today is gonna be working on us, each as one individual in each present moment. So those are some of the things to just keep in mind that we're going to, who knows anything about mindfulness? Has anybody heard the word mindfulness before or have an understanding of it? I can see some nods, yeah, some nods. Has anybody not been unfamiliar with the word, who really doesn't understand what it means? 

00:11:55
YURI I don't fully understand umm… mindfulness. 

00:12:00
ALLISON SPARGO And I think that's a really good observation that fully understanding mindfulness is something that might take years of practice… 

00:12:00
ANDY Right. 

00:12:05
Defining Mindfulness CBT 

00:12:05
Group leader describes group process 

00:12:05
ALLISON SPARGO Or might never be fully achievement. So let me describe kind of what mindfulness is so that we can keep that in a, in a thought of context as we progress over these next four sessions. So mindfulness is a mental state and it is a mental state of being at each moment, fully present during that individual moment. And our lives and our days are made up of a string of these individual moments, but it's a fully present in that particular moment. We calmly acknowledge and accept the things that we are experiencing, whether they are pleasant or unpleasant, our thoughts, our emotions, our bodily sensations and even our mind, which sometimes we feel like might be out of control. We're just trying to work on accepting and acknowledging the experiences as they come. So that's what kind of a general definition of mindfulness can be, the goals of our group in particular are to learn a little bit more about mindfulness, to practice being present in the individual moments, to practice some of the, the different quadrants of mindfulness. So mindfulness is about body, mindfulness is about thoughts, mindfulness of emotions, mindfulness of the mind. So we'll spend one session around each of those different topics, each of our sessions will start with their breathing activity, your breath is your anchor and mindfulness. And we'll talk more about that but just learning how to use your breath as an anchor, it's always with you and will always be there with you so long as you are living, your breath will always be there with you. So what you will learn about breathing and then well, address that introduce the topic. So whether bodily sensations or thoughts emotions we'll address that particular topic. Well, work through an activity or meditation around each of those topics depending on the group session we're in and then also process, right? So you can't have a group without process and that's really our opportunity to come together as a community. So one of the wonderful things about mindfulness is that, yes, we are all each sitting in our individual moments, in our present moment but we're sitting here in our present moments in this community. And so one of the great things about our group is that, our energy will feed us and sometimes, will be experiencing some of these unpleasant energies and that's okay because that's part of the human experience and sometimes, we can celebrate with each other, when we're experiencing a more pleasant experiences whether their thoughts or emotions. So those are some of the ideas around this particular group umm… don't… have any questions or, you know, comments, concerns?. 

00:14:40
YURI I just thought it was great when you said breathing because all of a sudden, I took this deep breath and I looked at everyone's chest to see that. If they were doing, I don't think I was even breathing that much, just a second ago. 

00:14:55
ALLISON SPARGO But you even in that moment became aware of… 

00:14:55
YURI Yeah. 

00:14:55
ALLISON SPARGO Your own breath and that's how we're going to… we're going to just become more intentional about that and so I'm glad that you shared even, even just saying the word breath, reminds you I'm breathing, right? 

00:15:10
YURI Yeah. 

00:15:15
Group leader uses psychoeducation by teaching members to be aware without judgement. 

00:15:15
SHANE BLASKO And just to add one more piece about it with mindfulness, another important component is its awareness in the present moment without judgment. So it's a very self-compassionate process. So we're… we're just really trying to be non-critical of ourselves. 

00:15:35
ALLISON SPARGO And again, these are things we're asking you and we're introducing you to these topics, there are things that will take years of practice and sometimes people still have a challenging time, not being self-critical, not judging because we're human and we live where we live and these things are our pressures that we experience, they just are. But to not be Judgmental of ourselves as we find ourselves be judgmental even okay, well, let's take some time and practice breathing. Okay?. 

00:16:15
Introduction of group exercise, creating pattern 

00:16:15
SHANE BLASKO Okay. So we do some of the different activities in the, in this group, we will start and, and each of the different umm… breathing activities or meditations with the bells and we'll, we'll ring the bells twice to let us know to begin and then twice to know to end, and what we can use the bells for with the active… with the breathing uh… meditations and other meditations as to help umm… bring our awareness back into the present moment so when I ring the bells umm… that lets us know to begin our breathing meditation, and then it will guide us in a short breathing activity. So umm… let us begin. 

00:17:00
[sil.] 

00:17:10
Mindfulness of Breath exercise 

00:17:10
SHANE BLASKO When you sit in your chair with your feet both planted on the ground, sitting upright in a signified posture. So that you can breathe and if you're comfortable, you can close your eyes, as you get comfortable. Just begin to notice your breath and your body. You don't need to try and deepen your breath, just notice where you feel your breath. 

00:17:55
[sil.] 

00:18:00
SHANE BLASKO Notice the sense of your breath as it comes in, in your nostrils across your upper lip, down your throat, in your belly, 

00:18:20
[sil.] 

00:18:25
SHANE BLASKO Noticing, if you feel your belly filling with air. 

00:18:30
[sil.] 

00:18:40
SHANE BLASKO You notice your belly as the air with the out breath contracting. Do you notice the breathe coming out the nostril? 

00:18:55
[sil.] 

00:19:00
SHANE BLASKO As you continue to pay attention to the breath and your body, you might be aware of other thoughts this is completely normal and nothing to be worried about. Just try and bring your focus back to the breath. See if you can pay attention to one complete breath cycle, as you breath in and out. See if you notice a pause between the out breath and the in breath. Just noticing what you're feeling and where with breath. 

00:20:00
[sil.] 

00:20:30
ALLISON SPARGO I think you said that feels good. 

00:20:35
Leader establishing group process 

00:20:35
KENZY Yes. It feels good, just a moment to pause. 

00:20:40
ALLISON SPARGO Already, our group has a different energy… 

00:20:45
YURI Yeah. 

00:20:45
ELIZABETH It's sort of interesting to me, uh… when Dr Blasko, you mentioned the pause and the breathe that I, I was able to acknowledge that I do in fact have a pause, in my, in my breathing umm… and that really helped me to work through, you know, the anxiety our just, you know, the, the process it itself, that was very nice. 

00:21:10
ALLISON SPARGO Thank you. 

00:21:15
ALLISON SPARGO Angela nodded. 

00:21:15
ANGELA Yeah I did. I, I recognize umm… the ponds in my breath as well. Umm… taking that, it's almost like a cleansing breath to just release that energy that tension and stress and to be able to just to be kind of let it go and it's like you immediately, when you umm… said just focus, try to focus on like one, one specific thing on, on the breath. I was able to remove all of that clutter that was in my head and to just relax, and just really be focused and, you know, it, it felt good. I could actually feel my body relaxing. 

00:21:55
ANDY It does that, that exhalation, does for me I literally feel a wave that just comes down, just drains out of my fingers, and drain out of my feet. It really, every inhale, I mean, you let it all out, just wash it you know. Every exhalation, the muscles get more relaxed and I feel my feet sort of sinking to the floor, you know. It's a… few more minutes of that, I'd be lost. 

00:22:30
YURI I'm just glad you said umm… which was different. You said you don't have to take a deep breath and so I feel like I get filled, I don't realize I getting anxiety about like okay, I need to really calm down if I take this deep breath, I must calm down and, you know, all my anxiety must go away, like I put too much pressure on myself. So when you said don't… you don't have the deep breathe, you know, just kind of help me to just focus on everything that you're saying about our breathing, through our… it, it just helped me a lot better, not to have the pressure that I have to deep breathe, that I can do it if I need to. So that was good for me. 

00:23:10
Group members pattern of speaking to group leaders 

00:23:10
ELIZABETH I just really appreciated that, that when you normalize those thoughts because I have tried my full exercises before and then I get lost in the other thoughts that come into my head and then I get frustrated with myself because I'm not doing it right 'cause I'm having all these other thoughts of what I should be doing right now. So I really appreciated you acknowledging that, that could happen and it's okay. And then that allowed me to sort of settle my mind. 

00:23:40
Group leader normalizes group members feelings 

00:23:40
SHANE BLASKO Not only could it happen, it happen… 

00:23:40
ANDY Does happen. 

00:23:40
SHANE BLASKO For everyone, it's a very normal part of the experience, yeah. 

00:23:45
ANDY Oh when Elizabeth point it out, when you, just like with the pause and the breathing, when you pointed out, when you brought it forward and said, this is normal, this is to be expected and just try to bring your focus back, it was just like immediately, all my random thoughts just went away, you know, get you right back where, you know, right back to the center. 

00:24:05
ALLISON SPARGO Did anybody struggle with the activity at any point? Okay. 

00:24:15
DIANA I kept refocusing myself, I guess, but it was there, I mean, the random were coming, I thought about "Oh, I needed to do this today, whenever I was up here, oh, yeah, I forgot to do this and…" but it wasn't like the thoughts were really interrupting the process for me at least, 'cause I was still very much paying attention to the breathing as well and I'm a little congested as you probably could hear so I was noticing how, you know, I was processing or how the air was coming in or going out because of the congestion and so. But it… I still feet at ease, I didn't feel any anxiety, even though I think I had a lot of things going on up here as well as trying to focus on the breathing. 

00:25:00
SHANE BLASKO So you're really being mindful of, this is how I'm breathing and I'm and, and aware umm… this is my congested breathing… 

00:25:05
DIANA Right. 

00:25:05
SHANE BLASKO And these thoughts are popping in my head and I'm focusing on my breathing and these thoughts are popping head and it's okay, and I'm focusing on my breathing and not getting critical of yourself… 

00:25:15
DIANA Right. 

00:25:20
SHANE BLASKO Not judging yourself or having any thoughts that pop in your head… 

00:25:20
DIANA Right. 

00:25:20
SHANE BLASKO Excellent. It's really one of the things that can really challenging I'm glad you brought it up, actually wanna go back to what you said about trying, when we try and control our breathing, the mindfulness brain activity is really I think, I think it's really nice as just being aware of how we're breathing if we, we can try and force ourselves to breathe more deeply but then we're not just being aware of how we're breathing. We're controlling our breathing and, and it does happen for a lot of us or we say okay, try and pay attention to your breathing and we think, "Oh I should be breathing a particular way." 

00:26:00
ANDY Right try to breathe properly. 

00:26:00
SHANE BLASKO Right. And so, so I'm really glad you brought up that you were able to remind yourself to go back to breathing to what was natural for you. So thank you for bringing that up. 

00:26:15
Group leader uses psychoeducation to encourage nonjudgmental of feelings 

00:26:15
ALLISON SPARGO So as you're noticing there are some things that can get in the way of, you know, the, the process so that all of mindfulness is to engage in the process, fully at each piece. The goal is not necessarily to become mindful, but to work on these moments as they appear without judgment if we can do that or to acknowledge the judgments when they arise. So we've gotta a small taste of breathing, we're gonna continue to work on breathing and you're gonna continue to work on breathing outside of sessions. And even when this group is finished, hopefully, you'll take the breathing activities with you because truly the breath is your anchor, I know I say that, the breath is your anchor. And when you feel whatever it is that you're feeling, return you're breathing. 

00:27:00
SHANE BLASKO It's probably you're most useful. You're most portable method because you have it with you everywhere you go. Umm… you can, you can go back to breathing anywhere. You could be driving, you can go back to your breathing, you can… so anywhere and everywhere you are, well, you need to refocus yourself and get back to that present moment. You can use that breathing, when you're in the middle of doing another type of meditation and you start to get lost, you can refocus with your breathing. So that's why we start with the breathing that's why we began each week's, our each umm… session with a breathing exercise. 

00:27:45
Leader encouraging group cohesion 

00:27:45
ALLISON SPARGO And again it will take practice, we'll practice it umm… if at any time, you want to pause group and say I need to refocus let me, you know, and this is our group right? So I want you to be comfortable, we want you to be comfortable and ask for things that you might need, so that if we're, if we're working in a way, that's not a style, that's helpful for you, let's work together. Let's talk it out. Also I want you guys to talk with each other because even though we're here as leaders, you have an outstanding amount of personal insight and if you're experiencing, it's likely that somebody else is experiencing some… something similar or relatable to you. 

00:28:20
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:28:25
Introduction of second exercise 

00:28:25
ALLISON SPARGO All right, so that's our breathing activity and one of the umm… the aspects of mindfulness is awareness of bodily sensations, there are a lot of different activities which will help you to become aware and acknowledge and, hopefully, nonjudgmental of your bodily sensations and one of them is called "A body scan." So anybody ever done a body scan?. 

00:28:45
ELIZABETH No. 

00:28:45
DIANA No. 

00:28:50
ALLISON SPARGO No, okay. All right so today we're gonna spend a couple minutes doing, what's called a "Guided Body Scan." We're going to ask that you move over here, we have some mats over here on the floor to get comfortable. We'll do our body scan, when we're finished, we'll come back and we'll talk about that experience as well, okay? All right. 

00:29:10

00:29:50
SHANE BLASKO That as you focus on your breathing, you can start to shift your focus from the sensations of the breath. You can move that focus down into your body, down into your foot, down into the big toe, of your left foot. So, that all of your focus is concentrated in that one toe, just noticing the sensations of that toe. 

00:30:45

Just noticing, what sensations if any of you feel and then gently move your focus to the heel of your right foot, again noticing any sensations that are present. 

00:33:30
[sil.] 

00:33:45
SHANE BLASKO If any distracting thoughts are coming to your head, you can use your breath to keep yourself from getting too distracted and focus back on the sensations in your body. 

00:34:10

00:35:05
SHANE BLASKO Just noticing what sensations are there if your leg is lying on the ground, the sensation of your leg against your, your boot or pants against the ground, that pressure, there is any tingling or tickling or itching, just noticing all of these different sensations. 

00:35:35
[sil.] 

00:35:55

00:37:35
SHANE BLASKO And gently pull your focus up through the middle of your back and into your chest cavity. And pay attention to the different sensations, and as you pull your attention higher into your shoulders, and your neck, pay particular attention to where in your shoulders and neck, you feel different sensations.

00:38:35
[sil.] 

00:38:50
SHANE BLASKO Noticing the difference in the experience or trying to attend a much larger portion of your body but also noticing that you can pay attention to a larger portion of your body, just like you can attend to a smaller focused part of your body.

00:42:45
Return to group process after body scan 

00:42:45
ALLISON SPARGO Wow, so you guys participated in a guided body scan and that was the first for you guys. Of course, you know, where a group so I'd like us to spend some time sharing, what that experience was like. Can you talk to us about that experience?. 

00:43:05
KENZY I felt like Dr Blasko's was soothing, you know, it brought me back to a place where, you know, just speak present in the moment and I like how you make that process in umm… I just, it felt good. I felt relaxing, I did have felt some distractions, I heard coughing and I heard umm… some laughs or maybe somebody umm… was trying to breathe and so that kind of, you know, umm… this, it was a little disturbing I had to go back to but I remember you said, I think uh… breathing is your anchor, so I went back to my breathing and then I was able to refocus umm… overall, it was good. I, I loved how I started feeling the sensations in every part of my body. It is good. 

00:44:05
YURI I think I struggled once I had once we got to like, in the midsection 'cause I could feel the, the toe, like when you say it, I'm like, oh my God, I can feel stuff there, there something's happening, you know. And I think I just don't pay, I don't concentrate on that that much like you said focus on the toes, it's like okay, don't focus on anything, just the toe, it helped me but then when I got it, I noticed once I got like to the midsection. I couldn't focus as much and so went back to the breathing and then when you said focus on the length of the arms umm… I think that helped me come back so I noticed that with… when it comes to focusing on my arms and my fingers, I can do that and from here down but when it was here to here, it was a struggle like I had a mental struggle with I was like I don't feel anything, do I feel anything and I started getting to thinking so I had to go back to my breathing. Yeah, but that was good experience. 

00:45:05
ANDY I had almost exact same experience with the, the, the chest area, when you were like focus on your chest on your and you're worked and right when you said it, I took a big deep breath and I felt that and I heard other people taking big deep breaths right when you said that, but then after that I couldn't feel a thing I was like okay, where's my upper body? And I just had to go back to just trying to breathe and then when we shifted to… you went up to our shoulders then I kind of got a little more focused in the arm. So I could definitely but ma'am when you first started with, feel the big toe on your left foot, ma'am that I'd knew exactly where that toe was. So I wonder if I don't know if it's got something to do with just this sort of… I'm not in touch with this part of my body, like I am with the extremities but yeah, I felt the same experience and then I'd tried to do exactly what you said, I just breathed. Get my… try to get my focus back on it. 

00:46:00
DIANA I was gonna say I thought about that as well because I think that when we're doing the toes and shoulders and not only did I focus on those areas, I found myself also physically moving those areas a little bit. So I think up in here, it's… you know, you can't really move that part of your body as much so uh… physically moving my toes helped me to focus but once we got here, it's like okay what do I move? How do I focus? So and that's something that will probably come with more practice I'm sure. 

00:46:40
ANGELA I have pretty much the same experiences mostly everyone else, but it was interesting that you said that because for me, when you said to focus on the big toe, focus on those areas, I found myself doing the same thing, actually, moving that body part to bring that focus there and it's, it's amazing because you're never really that cognizant of your big toe and I'm like I can actually feel my toe in my sock, in my boot. So that, that was pretty interesting but umm… as I moved up the body and you said to notice any tensions or pain or whatever, I could notice that the lower part of my back needed that stretch. Just from lying on the mat and then, I got stuck there and I was trying to move back up the body and I'm like, "Oh, I can still but I'm still very aware of this middle section of my back," and I just tried to breathe, I had to breathe a few times to really kind of get my focus back to the areas, you know, so I could move all the way up but I kind of got lost I think, because I was still focused on, you know, that area of my body. 

00:47:50
Processing shared struggles. 

00:47:50
Introduction of CBT into process of body scan. 

00:47:50
ELIZABETH I could agree with everyone umm… I, I had different experiences throughout the exercise umm… initially the first few minutes was very enjoyable for me, you know, I was able to slow down and relax. Umm… again, when we got into the midsection, I started struggling uh… because naturally, I tend to multitask and I tend to move at a very quick rate speed, so when we got to the middle section, I struggled with, "Wow, this is taking a really long time and this is going to really slow," you know, as my thoughts and I had to remind myself that this is a mindful exercise and I need to slow down and then I was able to once I let go of that thought and came back to the present, and just what the purpose was, it really just helped me to just slow down and just be in the moment and just enjoy the time of relaxation. Umm… and your voice was very soothing. It was wonderful and it just really helped me to focus on each segment of my body and it was really nice, thank you. 

00:49:00
SHANE BLASKO Thank you. 

00:49:00
ANDY I felt like Dr. Blasko… everybody's mentioned your voice I felt like your voice was a, a focal point like it was very soothing very, very calming but every time you would speak, you know, it was like drawing me in, you know what I mean, not to you but I just heard your voice, you know, and it was and you were saying, focus on this or move up to and it and it was almost like your voice was literally touching me, you know, what I'm saying like. When you spoke I felt like right there and it, and it would bring you back because I had, I had especially in the core of the body, just distracted thoughts all over the place and all of the sudden, I'm everywhere and but you would speak and it would just go… 

00:49:45
UNKNOWN Yeah… 

00:49:45
ANDY Yeah, it was nice, it was good. 

00:49:50
SHANE BLASKO Do you think you would be able to, with practice, do something like a body scan without a guide like self guided body scan? 

00:50:00
ANDY Yeah. 

00:50:00
YURI I don't know… 

00:50:00
ANDY I don't know, if mine would take that long because I would be rushing myself through it, you know what I mean, you would really take a lot of practice to make sure you pause long enough in each part of the body. 

00:50:15
ALLISON SPARGO And Yuri, you said, you're not sure if you could… 

00:50:15
YURI I'm not sure, 'cause I get lost, you know, I, I mean, my… I, I know, I, I don't think that's a do it, but I'm only a child so I focus and analyze, over analyze everything. So I feel like if I tried to do it by myself, just like how I was are great and then I got here, and I'm like uh… okay, wait, wait, I gotta get back, I gotta get back and I'm making myself anxious and then hearing her voice what to do, what to go back to, I mean, I guess it could through uh… training and then trusting, you know, to do that and I think that's always been like a little battle, you know, with me so. I mean, I possibly could but it feels good to just listen to somebody else doing it. 

00:51:05
ALLISON SPARGO It takes a little of the pressure off. 

00:51:05
YURI Yeah. 

00:51:10
Reminding group of goals. 

00:51:10
ALLISON SPARGO So I'm also thinking I heard a theme that you guys mentioned as far as, especially, when Andy said I would rush, I heard a lot of affirmations for that, yeah. Just to remind all of us that the process is the goal, not the end, which is counter to what we live in, right? 

00:51:25
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:51:30
Group leader acknowledges body language to promote insight 

00:51:30
ALLISON SPARGO So when we're in the experience and we're saying, "Hey, hurry up, I got things to do or what else could I be doing at this time while I'm also doing the mindfulness activities," that is incredibly normal and I think what we're asking you to do is, make a choice for yourself that you can live your lives in that way or you can live moment to moment, accepting each moment as it presents itself and accepting all of those thoughts and emotions and bodily sensations as they come to you. And that is again, the focus of, of our group sessions together. So today we started with our breathing, our body scan and I wanna make sure that if you have more processing around the body scan that we spend time there but I also wanna introduce you to the topics for our next groups, which will be mindfulness of thoughts, which several of you have said, "My thoughts, they're swirling, they're coming they're distracting," either internal or external. So that's gonna be the next group session is considering mindfulness of thoughts, not many of you have said anxiety, while somebody said anxiety I think it was you, who said anxiety… Umm… so emotions so mindfulness of emotions will be our third session, so being aware of the emotional experiences as they present themselves and then, the last session is… it's called the "Wandering Mind." Our minds wander and you make a face, you make a face like it's a bad thing. 

00:53:00
ANDY No, no, no I make a face like "Oh, yeah, all the time.". 

00:53:05
ALLISON SPARGO All the time. 

00:53:05
ANDY It's yeah, I'm totally in touch with that reality for me. 

00:53:10
ALLISON SPARGO Got you. 

00:53:10
ANDY Yeah. 

00:53:10
ALLISON SPARGO So in our last, in our last session together will be pulling it all together and then exploring our wandering mind, where they go, you know, what is that mind of ours doing to us, for us, with us. 

00:53:25
ANDY Well, and I'll throw it, I'll throw my hat in the anxiety ring too because my wandering mind usually goes to whatever I'm anxious about. 

00:53:30
YURI Yeah, me too. 

00:53:30
ANDY So yeah. 

00:53:30
ALLISON SPARGO Yes. 

00:53:30
YURI Yeah. 

00:53:35
ALLISON SPARGO But did you have anything that you wanted say about our experience today? 

00:53:40
YURI I wonder if it would be helpful to do before, going to see clients sometimes. I think that I have a lot to do and I'm have I'm like okay, I gotta see this client at one, next client at 2 and I'm wondering if doing things like this and just taking that time out like giving myself a full hour before seeing clients, will just get me back focus, I feel like I get myself 10 minutes before I go into the house… 

00:54:05
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

00:54:10
YURI I wonder how, you know, it will be to, to do that before seeing clients, so I was thinking about that. 

00:54:20
Group leader describes homework 

00:54:20
ALLISON SPARGO I think that's a great idea and although, we have homework that we can always assign you, you, you all know that the homework will be more meaningful if it's something that you choose for yourself. So Yuri, it sounds like you might have just chosen. 

00:54:30
ANDY Your homework assignment. 

00:54:30
YURI I need to, I think that, that will be very helpful honestly. 

00:54:35
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. And I just want to remind all of you that it's the nonjudgmental piece. So if you don't get to do the full hour or if the, in the hour that you've set aside, you find yourself distracted or whatever then, to not, not criticize yourself in those moments but to return to your anchor, you're breathing, right? 

00:54:55
ANGELA I think that's exactly what I was going to say… 

00:54:55
ALLISON SPARGO Okay. 

00:54:55
ANGELA Is for me, what's been key just thus far this morning is knowing, you know, it's okay to own whatever moment you're in, whatever you're feeling, whatever you're thinking, it's okay to own that, for that and it's nonjudgmental. It's so liberating to just, you know, hear that from, from someone else and just, you know, that's, that's been good for me. That's fine. 

00:55:20
YURI Now when I think about it, I think it's funny 'cause I just thought of umm… one of my clients and I asked her, I said "What changed, you know, from you being depressed at one time to now?" And she said "I listen to myself," and that kind of reminds me of this because I don't… I don't know if I always stop, you know, within the program, it helps you to think that way, you know, think… pay attention to yourself but it's like I feel like I… in the program I've been consistently reminded to do that because I don't naturally do it. So I think it's interesting that one of my clients all she said was I listen to myself now, well, now I feel like this is kind of edge just being in your moment and I don't know, if I always do that like just be in the moment and just relax no… not just naturally, I wanted to be a perfectionist on the mat, like naturally… 

00:56:10
SHANE BLASKO Yeah. 

00:56:10
ANDY Yeah. 

00:56:10
YURI It was like your breathe okay, breathe, okay, get it together. When we got here, it was a whole another league, you know, so I thought that was interesting. 

00:56:20
ALLISON SPARGO So I, I heard again a lot affirmations around that I wanna do it right, I wanna do it perfect. This are thoughts and so our Next time maybe we can pick up there with these thoughts that we wander around with, what are they doing to us? How can we use them, right? Okay. Well, so today we covered a few different topics so we went over some of the goals that you guys went… brought it to the group. Uh… we explore the goals of our group to umm… learn about mindfulness to practice mindfulness and to process mindfulness which we accomplished those three around our bodily sensations using the body scan. Umm… I think we're ready to just about break through the session and then we'll come back next time, start with our breathing activity and then explore our mindfulness of thoughts. 

00:57:10
YURI Okay. 

00:57:10
ALLISON SPARGO Okay? Perfect, thank you guys. 

00:57:10
YURI Thank you. 

00:57:15
Part 1: The Adult Group. 

00:57:15
Chapter Two: 

00:57:15
The Second Session Focusing on Mindfulness of Thoughts 

00:57:20
ALLISON SPARGO So today I'd like to welcome you to share what your experiences were like if you had made any meaning or any connection to the material that we, that we covered in our last group and see how you might have moved that forward. 

00:57:35
KENZY I mean, for me, it's umm… I've noticed like do not judgmental of anything but just to be live that moment and so I reminded myself that through out the day, you know, like, just, just be here, whatever I'm doing just leave this moment and it's being uh… a life changing for me, in that aspect. 

00:58:00
ANGELA I think for me, I've probably been practicing mindfulness without even knowing what I was doing because a lot of times even before I go into the site, umm… my internship site I will take that cleansing breathe and I will take a moment just take a beat before I walk in, just to make sure, you know, I'm, I'm here. I leave everything that's going on outside, and I'll think of, of anything else, I may have 15 different things going on at one time, outside of where I am but when I, you know, once I get out of my car, I step outside I'm just there in that moment and just experiencing whatever comes up. I had no idea I was practicing mindfulness. So it's really good for me to actually be able to know what I'm doing and then have, you know, it happened make sense, it have a purpose for it now. 

00:59:00
Group leader faciltates a check-in with members 

00:59:00
ANDY And you learn how to shut that stuff off. So now I'm recognizing too that, you know, some of the things that I just naturally do are part of what we're learning about here and that's kind of neat to be able to sort of put a, put a name on it and understand it better. 

00:59:10
ALLISON SPARGO It makes you feel a little bit normal, right? 

00:59:15
ANDY It's empowering too, though to say, you know, "Oh yeah, I, I do that." And I understand what that means now, what it does for me. So… 

00:59:25
ANGELA Absolutely, the function of it, yeah, the role… 

00:59:25
ELIZABETH I completely agree I think that umm… for me, it's, it's so useful in, in stress management uh… because we are all talking about, you know, as working professionals being available and present with our clients. So taking that cleansing breath having those 5 minutes on the drive to see your next client or to do your next thing, it really just helps center me, or specifically and to really just help me redirect the energy and it really does take a lot of stress off of my shoulders 'cause I don't go into that, I have to be perfect, I have to multitask, I have to do a million things at once. It just helps me to just slow down and be present for myself but then more importantly for my clients umm… and being available for that 'cause they sense that. So I appreciate that. 

01:00:20
Group leader summarizes current situation 

01:00:20
SHANE BLASKO What we're gonna do, work on today with the mindfulness of thought, it can help some of this anxious thoughts and then with our next session where we're gonna focus on mindfulness of the emotions, will also be really helpful with some of those anxious emotions and helping them with that and I will lead that for the next session to help explain that but will focus on the anxious thought process today and that will definitely help explain that part for you today. 

01:00:45
Establishing purpose of the 2nd group session 

01:00:45
ALLISON SPARGO Okay, let me introduce the activity and then we'll do breathing and get ourselves started, okay? Umm… so mindfulness of thoughts, we all have thoughts, right, our mind is working. Thought are actually really helpful, right. They've gotten us to where we are today. They help us solve problems. They help us remember things from the past and plan for the future. They help us figure out ways to get the things that we want but they also figure out, help us figure out what it is that we want, right? So our thoughts are… our mind is truly amazing. It's really amazing. Umm… sometimes, what happens is, we think thoughts that we're not aware of, yeah, okay and sometimes those thoughts can even become, maybe automatic. They come unwanted or even if they are pleasant thoughts, they're more of just a reaction rather than umm… something that is more intentional, right? So today we're gonna talk a little bit about mindfulness of thoughts, can you help me understand maybe some of those thoughts that pop up somewhat regularly like what thought is kind of right in your head, right now? 

01:02:00
ANDY How much money is in my account that savable? 

01:02:05
ALLISON SPARGO Great. Yeah. 

01:02:05
ANDY And when can I expect it to be received? 

01:02:10
YURI I was actually thinking about that join in a doctorial program, that's what I was thinking about 'cause Dr. Spargo, I was thinking like, "Man, do I really wanna go back to school??" Like at all that just happened and I'm like when you ask, what were you think right now? It's like "Oh my gosh, so that is something that I think about because I'm like, "Man, how much does it requires?" So it is a lot that comes with just thinking doctor… 

01:02:35
ANDY That one thought. 

01:02:35
YURI Looking at you, I'm thinking Dr. Spargo I started thinking about it and then when I get married, I want really to be Dr. Alum, and I'll be like Dr. Smith because the person I'm probably going to marry so I was just… that's what I think about. 

01:02:50
ALLISON SPARGO And so again, you're describing this whole process so just by seeing me and knowing the doctor part, you know, so all of these things are impacted by just things that are making you laugh out loud, you know, like, you know, sometimes they make sense, sometimes they don't but they have a lot to them, a lot of story that goes along with them. Anybody else wanna share a thought that popped up?. 

01:03:10
ANGELA I think, for me, the thought that's popping up consistently because I can see a light at the end of the tunnel, as far as finishing the program is coming up for me. 

01:03:20
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

01:03:25
ANGELA So the thought coming up for me is getting a job, getting employed, where am I going to do, what am I going to do for supervision that sort of thing. So that kind of like when I'm… what thinking about all the time. It's like what's the next step for me?. 

01:03:40
Group leader highlights themes emerging from discussion 

01:03:40
ALLISON SPARGO So I have to point out a theme, even though, you say it keeps popping up and it's here with me now, it's future focused… 

01:03:45
UNKNOWN Yes. 

01:03:45
ALLISON SPARGO All of your thoughts, they're not necessarily present about right here. 

01:03:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

01:03:50
ANGELA No, that's why this is so important, for me umm… to be mindful in present and cognizant of that of each moment, just being present in this moment. 

01:04:05
YURI I can see like about worrying I think that's been a consistent thing in my whole life. So like when I'm told to try to pay attention to the, what's going on right now, It's like completely different than what I'm used to every single day so I feel like this is gonna really help me in my daily life 'cause when you say, it's future, it is true, like everybody did say that so now, I'm thinking, I need to really work on, just being here with people and stop worrying about what I can't control or worry about, you know, the future. That's interesting, that's interesting. 

01:04:40
ALLISON SPARGO It is interesting and I don't want, I don't want you to feel self-critical or judgmental of what it is that is natural because these are habits, these are habits that we have learned over time either because they've been taught to us or we've learned them over time through our experiences because we know that by worrying about the future, maybe, we can alter it or have some control over it or move money if we need to so all of these things have served… served as a purpose in our life, right? What, what we are gonna be working on is having a choice again of noticing where our mind goes if it goes to the future, acknowledge it. It's goes to the future except that it goes to the future. Don't judge, where your mind has gone. But to just try to gently guide it back. It will probably go to the future or to the past or to worries. And those things are, are just natural and not to be again, judgment. We're… we're using that word a lot, right? Okay. 

01:05:40
SHANE BLASKO It's natural to go to the future or to the past or a little bit of both, right? Some people tend to be more feature focused, some people tend to be more past focused, some people like to do both a lot but, but present focus that's not typical. So… 

01:06:00
KENZY Yeah. 

01:06:00
ALLISON SPARGO So I'd like to introduce one more topic too. The notion that thoughts are not facts… 

01:06:05
KENZY Thoughts are not facts. 

01:06:10
ALLISON SPARGO They're just thoughts. 

01:06:15
KENZY You see, I have a questions some thoughts can become facts, too. If that how, umm… 

01:06:25
Group leader reiterates mindfulness CBT 

01:06:25
ALLISON SPARGO And it's a hard notion to get your head around. Umm… 

01:06:25
ELIZABETH 'Cause I think a little bit like CBT. 

01:06:25
ALLISON SPARGO Sure. 

01:06:30
ELIZABETH Thoughts, you know, change behavior?. 

01:06:30
ALLISON SPARGO So your thoughts won't impact your emotion? Your emotions would shift your behavior, depending on which one you wanna say comes first, yeah? We want our thoughts to feel like facts because it makes you feel comfortable and confident that I am right because I have experience… 

01:06:50
ANDY Right. Exactly, you said, my light bulb just went… 

01:06:55
SHANE BLASKO We want to try and control right, and so to try and figure out how to control something, we might think about it a lot. I might say well if I can just figure this out, they can just figure out how to think about this, or how to behave around this, then I can control something and I can control the outcome. I can prevent certain some kind of wanted out problem either, happening again or just happening. I can either protect myself or protect my loved ones. So, so we do this right? But we have to go back to, it's a thought and it's just a thought. 

01:07:45
YURI And I used that, I mean, I question myself all the time, when I have a thought, 'cause I'll, I'll try to make it factual but then I already know like I need to… like where did this thought come from? Did something triggered my thought or there's something I believe about myself or is there something I believe about another person, it's just my thought in the moment. So I always question my thoughts to get me to, to a spot. I do a lot of thoughts that way. 

01:08:15
Introducing Mindfulness-based Cognitive Behavioral Theory 

01:08:15
ALLISON SPARGO And something else too, from a mindfulness CBT standpoint is that even if it's a thought in this moment, in the next moment it might be a different thought or it might not be there at all. It might have just evaporated or moved through with your experience or your existence. So thoughts travel. They come in, they go out. Sometimes they stay a while. But they're not facts and we're not our thoughts. Those automatic thoughts that, sometimes, we experience. Those are not the only definition of us, where our own person in each moment. So I've introduced just a little bit about mindfulness of thoughts. What we can do today is, again just recently with the breathing activity and then try a little mindfulness and see where our thoughts are, from one moment to the next moment. Okay? okay. 

01:09:25
[sil.] 

01:09:35
SHANE BLASKO So we'll start with the bell again. 

01:09:40
[sil.] 

01:09:45
SHANE BLASKO Let your thoughts come just as they are. When you notice one, label it as a thought. 

01:10:05
Group leaders process mindfulness of thoughts exercise 

01:10:15
[sil.] 

01:10:35
SHANE BLASKO Right now in this moment what are you experiencing? 

01:10:40
YURI Umm… I'm sort of calm, very calm because, well, you know, I have to restrict your thoughts. No, no, no, that was different. 

01:10:50
KENZY I, on the other hand, I feel more umm… anxious I feel, I guess confronting the thoughts and, you know, that made me think that thoughts are not facts and umm… I was just thinking about that and umm… there are, there are some things right now that are occupying my… I'm thinking about and so the more I think about it, the more, you know, anxious I became. Umm… I don't know. Did anybody else feel like that? 

01:11:30
Group members seeking connection 

01:11:30
ANDY I went there and came back out the other side in, in the process but then when the bells rang and you asked what we're feeling, I immediately said, peaceful. While I was… during the exercise I was oh, oh, getting all anxious but just talking to myself but "Hey, what am I gonna do right now?" I'm gonna stay right here and be in this moment and so when you, when we all, you know, when the bells rang and I had my eyes closed, I opened up my eyes. I was looking at you actually and you were just in this zone… I was like "Yeah." right. That's. 

01:12:05
ANGELA It's almost like umm… initially like I'm liken it to a tornado, you know, how everything is swirling around initially for me, and then I just because I was thinking about everyone else and whatever… body else has going on like in my family or some of my friends or something. And I'm thinking about everything else and then it just the more that, you know, we went through the exercise I could just feel it kind of swirling down until I got to like the eye of the storm, just that peace, that calm so when you saw my face I was, I was there because I just started thinking about instead of it being still external, just being more internal and more present umm… with myself, with my own thoughts and just my breathing and just what's going on and I just got to just this pure place of just relaxation. 

01:13:00
ELIZABETH I agree with both of you. I, I sort of when the sound of the bell and I felt sort of like I was out of my body for a second, it was a sort of, you know, gradual flight back in because I was with both of you in every step, umm… when Dr. Spargo said, you know, think of the future thoughts, you know, I went to a future thought, you know, it naturally that force just naturally and then to a past thought naturally went there, it was so wonderful to be able to explore the thoughts without the judgment without the, "Oh, I shouldn't be doing this right now? Why am I doing that, I'm not doing this right…" and just all of that criticism that comes naturally for me, it was so wonderful. To just to explore the thoughts and be okay in the moment and I could hear the sounds of the air conditioner, air conditioning and it was soothing to me. Uh… so it was, it was wonderful. I, I too felt such peace more so than even on the mats. 

01:14:05
ANGELA Yeah, I agree. 

01:14:05
ELIZABETH I think for me when you, when you share that it feels so gentle like this process is very gentle, very smooth in nature. Even though, we're doing a lot internally, it still feels very soft, naturally, in my day to day everything's very abrupt quick, you know, sometimes it feels aggressive because of the just the nature of my job and everything and the speed that I function. So this is just uh… so this just feels like a very smooth transition into awareness, multiple facets of awareness, but awareness. 

01:14:45
[sil.] 

01:14:50
YURI I could… I could say like the rest of my day being pretty awesome, I'm like yeah, like yeah I like starting off like this. 

01:14:55
KENZY That's what, you know, I'm here and everybody talk about, you know, how relaxing and how good they feel and then umm… experiencing something different umm… you know, it's just hard to say it. 

01:15:10
ALLISON SPARGO And I'm glad that you did because this is not sometimes relaxation is a byproduct of mindfulness but it's not always because just like you mentioned at the mats, sometimes those thoughts in our head are not pleasant and sometimes, they're and welcome and sometimes they bring with them emotions. I'm glad that you are sharing with us because I don't think you're experiencing anything that is unusual but it is you're experience and, and unfortunately it is where you are in this present moment. I say, unfortunately, what am I doing? Guys you're not calling me, I'm judging. 

01:15:45
UNKNOWN I said judging all right. 

01:15:45
YURI That's kind of sad, I mean, it's kind of sad or you know, you feel like you can, yeah, you wanna be more present and you feel like you're kind of… 

01:15:55
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

01:15:55
YURI Battling it, but you're saying it is… 

01:15:55
ANDY Well, I think it's valid to point out and you just said it as you were going through what you said, this is present. 

01:16:05
YURI Yeah, exactly. 

01:16:05
ANDY So you are in your present, your present just not exactly entirely comfortable but then the question, then the question becomes, you know, now that you've become clear on what's on your mind, you know, accept it, right? This is, this is, this is my moment. 

01:16:25
YURI Right. 

01:16:25
ANDY Right and then process that consciously rather than having it beating you up in the back your skull and you don't even realize what you're anxious about or, or whatever might be bothering you. It's okay to say right now, I am really, really stressed out about this thing but to identify that thing in that moment is empowering in itself, right? 

01:16:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

01:16:50
YURI Yeah. 

01:16:50
ALLISON SPARGO Do you think so? 

01:16:50
SHANE BLASKO I think so… 

01:16:50
ANDY I think so. 

01:16:50
KENZY Liberating to, to be okay, feeling the way that I don't have to feel on the other way, you know… 

01:16:55
ANGELA You don't have to pretend it's better. 

01:17:00
KENZY Right. 

01:17:00
ANGELA It's just that you are okay. 

01:17:00
ANDY Right. 

01:17:00
KENZY And I think Angel like you mentioned that, you notice when you, when I came in. 

01:17:05
ANGELA Right. 

01:17:05
ALLISON SPARGO Can we talk about when sometimes things are unpleasant these thoughts, I heard a little bit of the future story because your plans were interrupted and so there was a little bit of a future there but, right now, you're not feeling, not thinking pleasant thoughts, right? I know you're feeling a lot and we'll talk more about that in our next session but the thoughts are not pleasant thoughts. And during the mindfulness activity they come. And sometimes they go but sometimes they linger, right? From one moment into the next moment into the next moment, it's great if we can have the pleasant thoughts and this present experience is lingering from moment to moment but that's not, that's not always a reality. 

01:17:45
ELIZABETH It's true. 

01:17:50
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. So what do we do? Yeah… 

01:17:50
ANDY I was just, I just had another little light bulb. 

01:17:50
ALLISON SPARGO Okay. 

01:17:55
ANDY Would you really start stirring the breathing exercise to think, just to let in the thoughts come, my thoughts immediately went to negativity, right? Challenges, problems, something's not in, you know, and that kind of thing. And so it's not that all of us in the room had positive thoughts and Kenzy didn't, I went straight to negative thoughts and, and I think that for me, now that I'm actually thinking about it. I go to, I go to problems a lot in my thinking… like my random thoughts are always about what next thing I have to fix 'cause I'm a problem solver by nature. I, I think that my, my random thought patterns always go to the next thing that has to be tweaked and fixed and handled. And that's stressful, you know. Be in my thoughts in that moment went to, went to a challenge, you know, a problem. 

01:19:00
Group leader affirms member's feeling and provides salient self disclosure 

01:19:00
SHANE BLASKO We find that a lot actually with, with the mindfulness activities as you mentioned, it what you mentioned with, with the body scan. A lot of mindful, mindfulness is not relaxation, right? Mindfulness… a lot of people say "Oh, I'm gonna relaxation activity, I'm gonna do a mindfulness activity and that's a mistake. Mindfulness is becoming more aware of what's happening in the present moment umm… when I first started doing more body awareness, I started experiencing a lot of physical pain because I became more aware of the physical pain in my body that I was not aware I was carrying around all the time. 

01:19:35
KENZY Wow. 

01:19:40
SHANE BLASKO But then I'm like "Oh, now I know what to work on.". 

01:19:40
ANDY Right. 

01:19:40
SHANE BLASKO So I had more awareness. So when we started paying more attention to our thoughts, we may and slowing down and paying attention to our thoughts and not multitasking as many of us do. We can become aware that we have a lot of unpleasant thoughts or anxious thoughts umm… and we may in that moment have that experience. So, so mindfulness is not always a pleasant experience. 

01:20:05
ANDY Right. 

01:20:10
SHANE BLASKO It's a process. 

01:20:15
KENZY Thank you. I'm sorry. No, I just wanted to say thank you for saying that because I, I had the idea before that mind was uh… way to become relax and not, I didn't feel that way. It's when I'm trying to say and so it's, it's good to know that it's uh… this is the process. 

01:20:35
[sil.] 

01:20:40
ALLISON SPARGO So sometimes people will bring up that I was being self-critical or I was judging myself for going to these problem areas or for, you know, these, this thought come, came and I pushed it away. Oh I shouldn't have pushed it away, you know, so all the self talk goes on, as you're trying to be present. Especially, because those are habits and we're working on creating a new way of being. Did anybody experience that in the mindfulness? I know… I see you're nodding your head, so you can see that that would be something that you can, you know, kind of understand did you experience it, during their… our activity? 

01:21:15
ANDY I don't know if I was self-judging as much as I was sort of self reprimanding like I had the thoughts, the negative thought. I immediately recognized that I'm having these are completely unproductive negative thoughts and I even thought about my 5-year-old, who's in kindergarten who has been struggling with his behavior this weekend, whether or not, he's gonna have a good day today. That was another thought I had. I can't do anything about that. So I'm in that same moment, I was sort of reprimanding myself. Stop thinking about that, there's nothing you can do about that right now and, you know, so I don't know if I was judging that I had those thoughts or just talking myself out, I don't know how to label it but that, that's what happened in my mind I was like "Oh, just, you know, stop there's nothing you can do, what do you… why even think about that right now?" Right, 'cause you said just let your mind go and then I immediately let my mind go, why am I thinking about that right now? 

01:22:10
ALLISON SPARGO But it's an incredible that you all laugh but when you let your mind go how often do you really just let your mind go? Not often right, not often because we control it, we need it to do things. 

01:22:25
UNKNOWN Yeah… 

01:22:25
ALLISON SPARGO No, I'm fine. 

01:22:25
ANGELA Exactly… 

01:22:25
ANDY I don't have time to just let my mind go. 

01:22:25
ANGELA It's almost like you, I guess it maybe like so reprimanding, it's like… you know, I don't really have time to think about that. So I think for me, going through this exercise, I'm like "Okay, stop thinking about everybody else, think about yourself, focus on yourself…" and that's a little uncomfortable sometimes, to just focus solely on yourself it's… it for me I kind of feel like, well, that's kind of selfish but it's really not, it's just owning, you know, that moment, being aware. So that's why… this I keep saying this is really good for me but it's really, you know, eye opening for me, to be able to just, you know, I have that liberty to just, not be judged. It's okay for you to think about yourself. It's okay for you to be in the moment and not have to worry about everybody else. 

01:23:20
SHANE BLASKO So and recognize that you when you let yourself go and just think you will also probably have thoughts about other people… 

01:23:25
ANGELA Right. 

01:23:30
[sil.] 

01:23:35
ELIZABETH I think for me, you know, relating to the Andy's the negative thinking, you know, I tend to do that all the time umm… just immediately go to the negative, stressful situations that are going on in my life and it's, it's very comforting to uh… give myself permission to feel how I'm gonna feel and think what I'm going to think and not put myself down or "Oh my gosh, what's wrong with me." So it really it's wonderful to hear from all of you guys that you have experienced that too and it's not… I'm not the only one that immediately goes to the negative, you know, as soon as I wake up, well, I have to fix this and I have this meeting and I have this stressful situation but just to explore it, be in it and know I'm safe. And I'm okay and that's okay, and I'll be all right, you know. 

01:24:30
ANDY I think it's valuable to, to recognize that it's okay, to not be okay. 

01:24:35
YURI Right, yeah. That's what I'm thinking. 

01:24:35
ANDY Yeah right. 

01:24:40
Closing of second group session 

01:24:40
ALLISON SPARGO Well, thanks to each of you for participating today. We'll pick up next time, mindfulness of emotions umm… similar structure. So we'll see you back here and will get started again. 

01:24:50
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:24:50
UNKNOWN Thank you. 

01:24:55
Part 1: The Adult Group 

01:24:55
Chapter Three: 

01:24:55
The Third Session Focusing on Mindfulness of Emotions 

01:25:00
AMY MCCLOUD Okay, great. So we just took a look at the first two sessions umm… I'd love to hear some of your thoughts. Umm… I noticed that you've got some really interesting, interesting responses to the CBT in mindfulness umm… activities that you were teaching the participants. You started with something called a body scan, can you tell us a little bit more what that is? 

01:25:15
SHANE BLASKO Sure, so the body scan is an activity where we umm… the individual will umm… either laying down or it doesn't have to be laying down if an individual is not comfortable lying down or it's not gonna be easy for someone to get up off the ground, it can be done in a, in a seated position but basically, the idea is for someone to really get in touch with their body, in at the present moment. You'll notice it's… again it's about the awareness in the present moment of why the body, what the sensations are in the body. It's again, it's that mindfulness of present moment. So I mean, we could be doing a body scan right now if we started really paying attention and there's, there's ways that we do it, where we start with umm… the big toe on the left foot but truly, you know, you could be paying attention right now to, you know, how we're feeling and all of the different parts of our body umm… because part of mindfulness is that real paying attention to all of those things that were avoiding paying attention to. 

01:26:25
AMY MCCLOUD Okay, great thanks. 

01:26:30
ALLISON SPARGO Actually what I was gonna say is because of, because of the video nature of this, you might not get to see all of the body scans and so what took us, you know, 20-30 minutes to craft it in this group. It's not all gonna show up in this video. 

01:26:45
SHANE BLASKO Right. 

01:26:45
ALLISON SPARGO And the reason for that is because body scans are created differently for different kind of populations and read it differently for umm… different groups facilitators, you're gonna focus on, what it is that your group means and so in, in actually several of the sessions, some of the actual activities might be trimmed, just for time purposes. However, that doesn't mean that that process isn't still valuable and we're demonstrating how to, how to make meaning of the process like you asked, it's process versus outcome. Uh… the price… the process is what this video is gonna be focused more on, so again just to just to remind everybody that the, that the, the editing has trimmed a little bit, just for length. 

01:27:20
AMY MCCLOUD Sure, and one other thing I don't think we've mentioned actually is that is, these are real group participants so these are not actors like you see on a lot of videos umm… but we're actually getting to see that the real group process occurring live in the moment because these are real people sharing real… real issues in the video. So can you talk a little bit about how that, that might have impacted these first two sessions as well? 

01:27:40
SHANE BLASKO Sure, I think umm… with any group you don't know what… is gonna show up, in your group session. So I was prepared for group conflict and I was prepared for umm… quiet members or for resistance, I think you probably were too because as for facilitators, you have an understanding of what traditional groups might look like. Umm… so we were prepared for the stages, the norm and the forming in the story and so umm… I think that because these were real people and because they were really motivated and they were very invested in the content of the groups. We didn't have very much of that. So it turned out actually umm… a lot more cohesive than what I was prepared for. Umm… 

01:28:25
AMY MCCLOUD Okay, so what stage if you had to classify, would you say these group emerge where in? 

01:28:30
ALLISON SPARGO Hmm… I think there was a little bit of the forming and then they might have jumped right into working. 

01:28:35
SHANE BLASKO Definitely I would agree with that. They seemed to have jumped straight from forming to working and skipped right over storming stage. 

01:28:40
AMY MCCLOUD Okay cool, so it was a very cohesive, a very cohesive group and I head you say, it really motivated group members that make the big difference. 

01:28:45
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

01:28:50
AMY MCCLOUD Okay, was there anything else that you wanted to highlight about the group dynamics in those first two sessions? 

01:28:55
SHANE BLASKO Sure, I think umm… this is just from my perspective that the group relied on us as facilitators, a little bit more in the first session and I think that lends itself to the, to the forming stage, they were trying to identify what the group roles were, kind of along the lines of the safety experience. Uh… the safety topics that we talked about earlier, we umm… explored some individual goals and also tied those into the group goals and then also in the second session, they again really took ownership so we knew we did the psycho-educational piece, but like I mentioned before I had a stack of process tape activities, notes, questions and things like that. We didn't really use very many of them. The group really took ownership for themselves and that was, that was a real treat. 

01:29:35
SHANE BLASKO Yeah they really took, they really took ownership of that process. 

01:29:40
AMY MCCLOUD Exactly what you hoped for and the group right there, they kind of takes off and you can take a step back as the facilitator. 

01:29:45
ALLISON SPARGO Yes, yes. 

01:29:45
AMY MCCLOUD Okay cool. So what did you expect to happen in the group and how did the group umm… either meet those expectations or surprise you a little bit? 

01:29:55
ALLISON SPARGO Umm… I think just to kind of reiterate that they went from the… that they engaged first in the forming stage that they did rely on us a little bit umm… but that they were also open to the experience. Those were things that I did expect, the unexpected was again just how quickly this group became cohesive and they're working alliance with us was really outstanding. So I think that that was a little… like I said it was a treat, it was a little bit unexpected… 

01:30:15
AMY MCCLOUD Right. 

01:30:20
ALLISON SPARGO …but always a hope umm… and this group they just really I mean they pushed each other. That was fantastic that umm… they were really dialoguing amongst each other and that if somebody didn't feel like they were part of the group norm, they… the group spent time to say hey, you know what, you might not have had that experience but it's mindfulness and that was your experience regardless. And that's pretty cool that even in the moment they were using the skills to help each other become more mindful. 

01:30:45
AMY MCCLOUD They really started taking ownership of the acceptance concepts. 

01:30:50
ALLISON SPARGO Absolutely. 

01:30:50
SHANE BLASKO Right. 

01:30:50
AMY MCCLOUD And what are your own emotional reactions, during these first two sessions? 

01:30:55
SHANE BLASKO It's a great question. Umm… for me, a lot of excitement, for me. Umm… I get a lot of excitement when I see people I, I have had such… I love this stuff, the mindfulness particularly and mindfulness CBT, and when I see others having such a positive experience with it it's very exciting for me. Umm… I did expect there to be maybe a little bit of resistance to it. Even though, they came to this group they wanted to be a part of this group umm… for there to be such a quick positive response to it. So I had a lot of, there's a lot of excitement. It's very… yeah. 

01:31:40
AMY MCCLOUD Right that's the fun stage of group, certainly it's when you get the group cohesion and get to the working stage… 

01:31:45
SHANE BLASKO Absolutely. 

01:31:45
AMY MCCLOUD …so I'm also hearing that that might not be typical and so for someone else that's facilitating a group that was somewhat although it was a group with real participants, someone of a specialized setting, highly motivated members of the work, screened and sort of hand selected for this demonstration. 

01:32:00
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

01:32:00
AMY MCCLOUD So it wouldn't always be except umm… expected in a mindfulness CBT group to have that level of cohesion right away. 

01:32:05
ALLISON SPARGO And I think we spent a lot of time… you mention the word buy in. We spent a lot of time pre-group and even in that first session uh… creating an understanding of what it was that the group goals were. And I think because of that there was less confusion, there was less resistance because they knew and sometimes that not knowing to create vulnerability or uneasiness. And we didn't really experience that in this group because we spent so much time preparing them before the group and then also, you know, explaining the group goals in the first session. 

01:32:35
AMY MCCLOUD And so what were some of those goals? 

01:32:35
ALLISON SPARGO Uh… just going back to the definition of mindfulness, those four things that she mentioned as far as, becoming aware in the presence in the present moment, nonjudgmental and so just to, just to reiterate that we were working on not changing our thought patterns or not changing our emotional reactions but becoming more aware of them and accepting them and as a byproduct some experienced relaxation, some of our participants experience relaxation and like I said some umm… experience not so comfortable experiences of exploring their thought patterns. 

01:33:05
AMY MCCLOUD So as a facilitator, what is that like to sort of manage group members, they're having vastly different experiences in the same room? So some are relaxing and feeling comfortable and others are feeling a little discomfort with the mindfulness techniques. 

01:33:20
ALLISON SPARGO I think for me, I just… I'm flashing back to Andy and Kenzy's reactions umm… Kenzy was really umm… she was really vulnerable and she took some time to talk to us about, what it was that was coming up for her and just for to preserve, preserve the group safety, there were again some edited portions but umm… there was a dialogue between Andy and Kenzy that really stands out in my mind as far as him saying, you know, what it was uncomfortable for you and that's okay. And even though I… he was mentioning that, even though he ended in a positive place but he sifted through all that uncomfortableness and he waited through it and he just held on, it was like I'm uncomfortable, I'm uncomfortable, this is my thought, this is my thought. And at the end, by letting all of those things go, he came out in a different space, where she didn't, she didn't go through that same process but he again just sitting there normalizing and validating for her without our input 'cause that was a very internal moment for him. And we could have never known that he had done that but he did share that and that was pretty awesome that20, he connected with her on that level. 

01:34:20
AMY MCCLOUD So the group members really supported each other and kind of helped each other, worked through the feelings in the room that might have been vastly different? 

01:34:25
ALLISON SPARGO Absolutely. 

01:34:25
SHANE BLASKO Yeah. 

01:34:25
AMY MCCLOUD Okay, Cool, well thank you. Is there anything else that you wanted to highlight about those two sections that we dispute? 

01:34:35
SHANE BLASKO There is something that I think it's important to know and that is that umm… these participants are uh… primarily, umm… interns in counseling fields or graduates and so it is important to know that many of them do you have this counseling skills and so they may, you know, their ability to empathize with each other and that their willingness to be so vulnerable in this group. I think may have been impacted by that… 

01:35:05
AMY MCCLOUD Sure. 

01:35:10
SHANE BLASKO …and so when we say that they were, you know, we talk about how, you know, that cohesiveness in this group and their willingness to go there and be so vulnerable and help each other, you know, they were really there, they really were there for each other in that empathic way, you know, this, you know, this was a very unique group and I think some of that may have been a result of who they are as individuals. 

01:35:35
AMY MCCLOUD Sure so the group membership was certainly unique. 

01:35:35
SHANE BLASKO Absolutely. 

01:35:35
AMY MCCLOUD So where we go in this demonstration, maybe, it would take you several more sessions in a, in a real world setting potentially… 

01:35:40
ALLISON SPARGO Maybe. 

01:35:45
SHANE BLASKO Potentially, yes. 

01:35:45
AMY MCCLOUD Okay great. Umm… what uh… you set us up for what we have to look forward to in our next session? 

01:35:50
ALLISON SPARGO Absolutely. So in the next sessions we're gonna be exploring mindfulness of emotional reactions. And so we're gonna be taking the information that we have learned to previously including the mindfulness of the bottley reactions and the mindfulness of thoughts and we're gonna build on that and we're gonna explore with our clients, our participants umm… what it is that their emotional responses are. And again we're going to remind them to not be judgmental of themselves, to stay present in the moment umm… and if that judgment does come up that we will, we'll explore where that comes from and how to kind of work through that. Umm… and then in the final session we're gonna spend a lot of our times summarizing the material that we've gotten so far and then talking about how to move that material outside of our group setting and into umm… more of a real world setting. 

01:36:35
AMY MCCLOUD Okay, great let's take a look. 

01:36:35
SHANE BLASKO So we talk about mindfulness of emotion. We, we start by talking about as human beings, we do a lot to avoid our emotional experience. Umm… particularly, those which we deemed to be unpleasant and emotional experience, umm… but the end result is that we end up suffering because we don't actually experience our motions. So with mindfulness, what we do is we actually allow ourselves to experience the emotion as it comes up. So we, we use what we learned with the mindfulness of the body and we actually trying… we pay attention to the experience of emotion in the body, what we're feeling, where we're feeling it and we pay attention to that and we allow the emotion to be in and as it is, instead of trying to stop it. Instead of trying to push it down, instead of trying to avoid it and all of those things that we do and we do this and we just allow it to happen, and we just like that that's sort of that wave of the emotion. We let it come. Breathe, try not to stop breathing. Sometime we do that. 

01:38:05
KENZY Breathing is to anchor… 

01:38:05
Introducing Mindfulness-based Cognitive Behavioral Theory. 

01:38:05
SHANE BLASKO It is, it is our anchor, yes. And go through that experience and so we continue breathe and we have this realization that we're not having that, that emotion anymore. And in, in general we allow it to pass. We may come back, we may have that emotion again. But is… when we do this, we allow this, emotions too… they come and they go. And then we don't have to hold on to that suffering anymore. We can let go of the suffering and umm… it's a very different experience than what we used to know. Okay? 

01:38:50
ALLISON SPARGO I see you guys are getting ready, you remember. 

01:38:55
SHANE BLASKO We'll start with our breathing. Okay, we'll bells to get us into the present moment. 

01:39:05
Introduction of group exercise - Mindfulness of Emotions 

01:39:10
Group leader process mindfulness of emotion exercise 

01:39:10
ANGELA I think I still feel relaxed. Umm… yeah, I think my… I didn't really get to emotional, I think 'cause I was still in such a relaxed place. Umm… and my thoughts tended to be more umm… interal. They just seemed to be, you know, I was just more focused on myself, more aware of my breathing. Umm… so I'm, I'm, I'm just so very relaxed, just peaceful. This, this, you know, the state of mind. 

01:39:50
[sil.] 

01:39:55
KENZY It's good. I umm… I felt kind of opposite again. I'm, I'm not trying to be difficult but I, I felt like I wanted to not feel and you know, like push it and, and not like I had to become aware like, I'm not, you know, I have to just let yourself feel what you're feeling. Umm… but I kept thinking of other things so that I would avoid the part of feeling. 

01:40:25
SHANE BLASKO So you were aware of yourself trying to avoid experiencing the emotion? 

01:40:35
KENZY Yes. That was my experience. 

01:40:40
SHANE BLASKO Did you judge yourself when you were avoiding, are you able to not judge yourself for the avoiding. 

01:40:45
KENZY Umm… I didn't judge myself. I didn't… 

01:40:45
SHANE BLASKO Great. 

01:40:50
KENZY I just knew that I didn't wanted to purposely. 

01:40:55
[sil.] 

01:41:00
YURI I don't think I like paying attention to my feelings. I start to get, and start again to get frustrated, like in anxious. And I'm really anxious more so frustrated so I was like, why, you know, why am I feeling like that? Then I call myself impatient, while we're the exercise. And so I was like why, why can't you just be here, you know? I think I struggled a lot. I noticed myself struggling a lot more then with the thinking like 'cause my, my feelings can be negative and I can get lost all in that but it's okay, you know, to be either way but I don't know, I didn't feel it's, I don't feel it very comfortable. I had nothing to do with how the exercise went or anything, it's just me. Just being like that, so I wonder, yeah. I like being intention to my feelings. 

01:42:00
Sense of Universality 

01:42:00
ELIZABETH I think I'll definitely take you back off of that your statements what you shared because in the exercise, I felt content but then I started feeling upset that I wasn't identifying an emotion 'cause I tend to go for the negative or the stress or the anxiety. And since I didn't have that that was making me anxious somehow, it's is like that I didn't have any anxiety or stress about anything was making me anxious. Umm… so when you were sharing, it brought it to the forefront of my consciousness because at the ends of the exercise I didn't really have anything other than contentment like I don't have any emotions 'cause I'm so used to going to the stress, the anxiety, the anger, you know, those negative emotions that when I had none, I didn't really know what to do or say so that's really interesting and very interesting. 

01:43:10
Deepening the focus on emotional mindfulness 

01:43:10
ANGELA I don't think just from hearing you say that I think that's a really good point because sometimes, you know, it's easier for us to talk about the negative emotions because it's almost like commonplace but when you talk about, I feel great, I feel good, I'm happy, I'm… you know, it's like sometimes you feel and there's that nonjudgmental big factor coming in. You feel like "Well, I don't wanna gush in case someone else is having, you know, a rotten time or rotten day but if you're happy in this moment…" this exercise is teaching me, "…if you're happy in that moment then owned it, you're happy in that moment." Just it's okay to be happy, just like it's okay to not be happy but it's okay to talk about that you're happier, that you're really in a good place and not worry about what everyone else is thinking or feeling about it, you know. 

01:44:00
ANDY And I'm torn. I'm with… I'm with Kenzy I spent most of that exercise trying not to feel things. 

01:44:10
YURI Yeah. 

01:44:15
ANDY Umm… I'm very, very happy with the way my life is going today. 

01:44:20
[sil.] 

01:44:25
YURI I saw you take a breathe air inside so I just… wondering why? 

01:44:30
ANDY There's a lot, there's a lot… there's a lot about my life before today, that I'm not happy about. 

01:44:40
YURI Okay. 

01:44:45
ANDY And I punish myself a lot, I try to, you know, I'm spending every minute of every day trying to make up. 

01:44:55
[sil.] 

01:45:00
ANDY And I'm very in touch with the fact that I'm doing a really good job, making up for pains that I've caused or time that I've lost but I beat myself up about it a lot. 

01:45:20
Group members adjusting depth 

01:45:25
ANDY So that's what I was trying not to feel… thank you very much. I, I spent a lot of time, you know, being very hard on myself. Not about the man I am today but about the man I was. 

01:45:40
YURI Man, think about how far like, is it… I like completely can identify with that though. 

01:45:50
ANDY Well and I think most of the people involved have forgiven me. 

01:45:55
ANGELA That's the first I thought that… 

01:46:00
ANDY That's what I was about to say I, you know, I'm so hard on myself and I'm part of it and I let myself do it because I feel like it keeps me motivated to continue being good to those people. Umm… but man I have not forgiven myself. 

01:46:20
ALLISON SPARGO And so when he said quietly… 

01:46:20
ANDY It's her fault. 

01:46:25
ALLISON SPARGO Kind of pushes it off that's what… 

01:46:25
ANDY She made me think about it, yeah, I mean, it was, you know, I'm telling you guys it was insane that uh… my face was just covered tears, when we stopped the exercise 'cause I was just… 

01:46:35
ALLISON SPARGO But you're experiencing what Dr. Blasko mentioned as far as unless you work through something, you carry it with you. So you're carrying it with you and you recognize it and you realize that it's got purposes not only to remind you about who you don't wanna be anymore right now. Who you do wanna be and who you want to keep moving forward so it does have purposes. 

01:46:55
ANDY Well, that's not that I don't allow myself to recognize it but I don't allow myself to recognize it in a room full of other people. You know, I, I'm okay with… I'm not one of those guys who doesn't cry, I'm okay with crying, but I generally am not okay with crying in front of anybody else. My lovely wife is not a very soft, warm or fuzzy person. So I don't cry to her, I just sit in my car, when I have my time and I think about those things and I cry it to myself. And that's okay, I don't need somebody to cry to but I do have to, I don't know, I just haven't, I haven't forgiven myself yet for a lot of my regrets. So, of course, whenever anybody says "Well, just let your feelings out" that's the… that's the most potent feelings that I suppress, right, because the moment, it's not right, it's not right, right now, well, maybe in this group. It's right, right now but yes, as you go through your daily life, you know, like for example if I'm having a really great experience with my children and I'm reveling in how happy that experience is in that moment that we're having a great time, that is not the time for me to beat myself up about lost moments before and to break down in tears, you know. 

01:48:20
YURI That's it be there in that moment. 

01:48:25
ALLISON SPARGO So, I can't help but think what if you are experiencing that self-doubt or self-loathing or whatever even if you are experiencing happiness, can't you experience two different emotions simultaneously? 

01:48:40
ANDY Well I wonder too and it is just as I told, as I was just talking, a memory came to me, Christmas, I was sitting my chair we're all opening presents and I just started crying. And my wife was like "Why are you crying?" And I'm like, "I'm just… I don't know." And that happiness is tied to that pain but in this moment I'm happy. 

01:49:05
[sil.] 

01:49:10
ANGELA Because now you have a chance to be happy. You have something to be happy about. 

01:49:10
ANDY Right. 

01:49:15
ANGELA Right. 

01:49:20
ANDY That's the… that's tied directly to the pain. 

01:49:20
ANGELA To the pain. 

01:49:20
ANDY It's the exact opposite of where I… where myself loathing and my… and, and my anger and my pain about those events, you know, come full circle. And like you said to me, right now, I couldn't ask for anything more, I mean, life is right I mean things are going great. But every great moment reminds me… 

01:49:40
YURI The pain. 

01:49:45
ANDY So yeah. 

01:49:45
YURI I think it's good to allow ourselves that I feel like all I hear is how much we try to restrict certain things, you know, but like when you said, you know, just allow, you know, allowing yourself to feel whatever way we feel in the moment rather than trying to control it. I mean, it hurts sometimes or might feel happy but feels good to not have to just let it be, you know, whatever you are feeling. 

01:50:10
ALLISON SPARGO And I'm sitting over here thinking that even contentment is good enough, right? It's not an emotion, it can't be good enough. That's okay. 

01:50:20
ANDY Well content is an emotion, isn't it? I mean, yes peace… being at peace is an emotion. 

01:50:25
ALLISON SPARGO But it's not a good enough one or it wasn't the right time for you. 

01:50:30
YURI I wanna say, I need some drama in my life. 

01:50:30
KENZY Exactly. 

01:50:35
Group leader uses humor to clarify a point 

01:50:35
YURI I'm going to be a part… 

01:50:35
ALLISON SPARGO And we left back, yeah. 

01:50:35
YURI Then what you expect it but then I mean going from the body to the, you know, the body, the mind, the emotions, you don't know where you're going end up. Why do you have to already decide it, you know, you can't do that really if we do, if we do it we're just restricting ourselves. What have we learned, you know, even being in here at this time so that my mind is, I'm fill in, this is interesting. 

01:51:05
Installation of hope regarding the growth of the group 

01:51:05
ALLISON SPARGO I'm hearing, I'm already hearing growth just from these first three meetings together, whereas we're not rushing to get to the goal. We were experiencing the comforts and discomforts of the process together. 

01:51:15
Participants reporting hope and safety around universality 

01:51:15
KENZY Well, just knowing that I thank you for, you know, expressing how you feel because I umm… and everybody actually and, and I've been there, I've been where, you know, you everything's good and you feel like what's going on, why don't I have something to be worry about or, you know. And, and so umm… I can relate to but with you expressing how you feel, I, I don't feel alone, you know, I don't feel umm… having a lot of struggles to right now, just in general. In general just don't know, you know, it's okay. So it just feels good. It feels good to, to know that umm… things will pass, you know. 

01:52:05
ALLISON SPARGO And it's hard to be present in the moment, isn't it?. 

01:52:05
ANGELA It is. 

01:52:10
Group leader uses psychoeducation to teach about the difficulty maintaining a present focus 

01:52:10
ALLISON SPARGO Especially when it's uncomfortable, especially when it's uncomfortable and we try to rush. 

01:52:15
ANDY Oh yeah, I was… you were talking when our during our exercise say, you know. Whatever you were saying I don't even remember. But all I was thinking was let's just wrap this up, yeah. I didn't wanna be in that moment, you know, I was like okay. And then you got really quiet for like whole minute. 

01:52:35
SHANE BLASKO Yeah. 

01:52:35
ANDY And I'm going tic tock, tic tock, tic tock, tic tock… 'cause that was not where I want… I did not wanna be in that place in my head, you know, so, yeah. 

01:52:50
BLOINDE Well, I was aggravated because I couldn't stop coughing and then, I just had this thought. Umm… I mean the coughing is genuine, it was very authentic. I was really coughing. 

01:53:05
ANDY It was in the moment. 

01:53:05
DIANA It was in the moment but then I just thought to myself, "Uh… I wonder was that a physical reaction to having to sit with emotion and I didn't subliminally or something that's just not what I do. And I just had that that thought and I mean all of that, you know, I was in uh… I wasn't in character that was real but I just wonder if I mean, I know I was coughing earlier or during earlier sessions but that just kind of a popped in my head just now, I was hmm… 

01:53:40
ANDY Were you giving yourself an excuse?. 

01:53:45
DIANA Right, was I giving myself… was just literally giving myself an excuse, not to because I, you know, when, when we were on the… I know I'm coughing because my sinusitis is whatever, so when I first started coughing I was like why am I coughing? I'm not sure, you know, I'm sitting up straight so nothing is draining, so I shouldn't be coughing now, but that didn't stop so I don't know, just popped in my head. 

01:54:05
ALLISON SPARGO So you're wondering that was some resistance to… 

01:54:10
DIANA Right, right. I mean in, in it's definitely possible because of when you were talking about the umm… the high school I just thought to myself, you know, I know that I learned very early on to monitor, I guess, my emotions or to… I don't know, I mean you could feel them but not necessarily sit with them and so I think that's something that I'm just, you know, that's just what I do. I'll fill them and then it's like okay, what's now? You know, what's next? Let's keep my, my home address but always just keep it a little bit and I'm pretty good at that till every now and then you can't keep moving if run into a brick wall. 

01:55:00
YURI It's freeing to pay attention to yourself and not to ignore ourselves, you know, I don't wanna ignore myself anymore. 

01:55:10
ANDY I think a theme I'm hearing hears is, you know, even with feeling content, you aren't comfortable feeling content and like we're all reporting, I don't wanna be in that moment for whatever reason, now that it was necessarily painful, mine was painful, yours wasn't painful, yours was… almost subconsciously, uncomfortable right? But we're all… man don't force me into the moment, you know, 'cause then I have to pick the moment apart. 

01:55:45
ELIZABETH I tend to naturally be very emotional person. So I'm really surprised at myself that I don't have more to say, right now. Umm… and I don't know what that's about but it's something that I need to explore further. 

01:56:00
ANDY Well and that inside alone is what you're gain from this moment. 

01:56:05
ELIZABETH Exactly. 

01:56:05
YURI Yeah. 

01:56:05
ELIZABETH Absolutely. 

01:56:05
YURI 'Cause you're here, you're just here… 

01:56:10
ANDY And I'm the, and I'm the exact opposite. I'm not the emotional person, right? When there's a fight, I'm not the one that yells, I don't yell, I don't slam doors, I'm the… I'm the rock right? When everybody else is upset I'm the problem solver but then when I get in that, in that moment all this emotion that I don't know how to deal with, you know, coming. 

01:56:30
YURI And what would you be then? Like what would you be then if you just let yourself be emotional? 'Cause your saying but you're not, but your kind of emotional. 

01:56:40
ANDY Well, I, I'd probably be obliterating idiot for couple of hours and I gotta work, you know, freaking out to let it all out, you know. 

01:56:50
Summarizes what's being processed. 

01:56:50
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. I think I'm hearing that each of you has kind of like a pattern of being in the world, when you're not mindful of it that you haven't kind of listened, operating system. Yeah. So what I like you to do is just kind of pay attention to that between the session and next session, next session we're gonna pick up with the wandering mind. So even though, you're aware of your patterns or processes of, of interacting in the world. We'll see where, where you go naturally, where that mind wanders to. We're gonna integrate bodily sensations, mindfulness of thoughts, mindfulness of emotions and put it all together and wrap it up. So that we can look to the future or sit in the present moment. Okay. Well, thank you again and we'll see you next time. 

01:57:35
UNKNOWN Think you. 

01:57:40
Part 1: The Adult Group. 

01:57:40
Chapter Four: 

01:57:40
The Final Session - 

01:57:40
Pulling It All To 

01:57:45
ALLISON SPARGO Do you have any thing that you would like to bring for this particular session, as we wrap up? 

01:57:50
Preparing for closing session 

01:57:55
KENZY I just went to say that last question about being emotional… emotionally mindfulness umm… it just to me means giving permission to myself to feel, and it's okay. And so I've been, you know, thinking and considering and being more aware of that. 

01:58:15
ALLISON SPARGO Good and what has that been like for you to give yourself permission? 

01:58:20
Group leader facilitates discussion on any learning that is occurring 

01:58:20
KENZY To, to give me myself time to, into really know where that emotion is coming from, not to rush it put it under the rug but to really just find out, what it means to me, why is this important, why am I feeling this way? 

01:58:45
ALLISON SPARGO Okay, well I know, you know, we have a small homework assignment last time to consider some of the patterns that you might operate from, right? We're going to move towards what's called the "Wandering mind." So anybody heard that term before? 

01:59:00
YURI Not really. 

01:59:00
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah, yes and no, yeah. So the wondering mind really just is a description of what our mind does naturally, right? It goes where it goes. And again just to remind some of the, the basic beliefs that we've been practicing are that's self reprimanding or whatever it is the words that you used, to be to be gentle if you do notice yourself coming up with those thoughts or feelings to use your breath as your anchor. To be gentle with yourself, and to remain open and curious in each moment as it presents. We are gonna be pulled into the future, we might remember the past. These things are somewhat unavoidable but our goal is again, not to control these things, just to recognize them notice them and gently bring yourself back, right? So right now, we're gonna practice uh… meditation and it's gonna be an integration of all of those ones that we've practiced so far, okay. So if your mind goes, if the feelings so, okay, we'll just will, we'll just go with them. 

02:00:10
KENZY Okay. 

02:00:15
ALLISON SPARGO Okay, so we'll being with the bells again. 

02:00:20
[sil.] 

02:00:30
Wandering Mind Activity - edited for time. 

02:00:35
ALLISON SPARGO Welcome back. So that was our first try, pulling it all together. 

02:00:45
ANDY That was better than the last one. 

02:00:50
ALLISON SPARGO Oh, better. 

02:00:55
ANDY I was all over the place, I mean, I was all through every thing, business. I own my business so my business is my life. So it'd work in home or not very sit, well separated 'cause my oldest child works for me, my wife is my accountant, you know, that kind of things but you just work at home, ex's, children, all those things that I was reporting last time the painful feelings, all of the things that are right about that now, just to hold, just… I mean, I was just everywhere. I was think about books I've been reading and television shows I've been watching it but I'll just really as I reported, I'm happy with life right now. So all of that kind of just sort of fell in this… not ecstatic just peaceful. And they're still so much going on right? All of us in here working hard and getting somewhere, you know but… to take a big picture in the moment. It's good. 

02:02:05
ALLISON SPARGO Did you feel any bodily sensations? 

02:02:10
ANDY Shattered, a couple of times, which was kind of strange. Yeah, I got in touch with a little bit in that exercise. 

02:02:15
[sil.] 

02:02:20
ANGELA Oh sorry, you go ahead. 

02:02:20
DIANA I was gonna say, I nodded a couple of times so, I mean, but I'm not sleepy. Honestly I don't feel, you know, there are times when I recognize I'm trying to push away stress or anger or whatever but I didn't feel it that today. I just felt, you know, a sense of calm peace. 

02:02:50
ALLISON SPARGO Okay. 

02:02:50
BLACK I think or for me, umm… I started out really peaceful and mellow and then I started becoming aware of umm… I just started thinking about different things, other things going on outside umm… or within my family and I started to feel a little bit of the anxiety but as you were talking, you were talking about, you know, being aware of, you know, our body and so that I could actually feel because I carry a lot of my attention here and the more that you talked I could just feel it just kind of oozing out, I could feel it, actually feel it kind of like oozing down my arms and out my fingertips and then I started hearing music. Umm… and it just, you know, remembered the breathing and it's just kind of got me back to the peaceful place so by the end, when you rang the bell, I was like "No, I don't wanna go. I want to stay here." So that was… it was really good, yeah. 

02:03:50
ALLISON SPARGO Okay. 

02:03:55
KENZY For me, umm… I have both positive and negative thoughts come, but more than, mostly positive I've thought about life, you know, because there was a death in, in our, in the family. Umm… I thought every time, you… that, that breath is your anchor, I'm reminded of umm… precious life is and, you know, it's… but a breath and so, but it wasn't negative thing, it's positive and, and then I like some of you have said I had a vision of something and I saw uh… the sun, like a sun… the sun heating in and, and it was peaceful within and I saw a white blanket, I don't know why and so it just umm… I don't know that moment of peace and then in my body I also felt umm… some emotion in my chest. Umm… and I started think of some things that I'm looking forward to and not getting ahead of what I'm hoping that will happen but if being okay feeling that emotion. 

02:05:10
ALLISON SPARGO And that's quite a change from the last, even the last time. 

02:05:15
KENZY Yeah. 

02:05:15
ALLISON SPARGO You look a little confused, how did this happen? 

02:05:20
ANDY You think there's almost a science behind it? 

02:05:25
Participants exploring shared experiences. 

02:05:25
KENZY If the, the sciences that I'm letting myself feel and be okay, right? 

02:05:30
ANDY It's just amazing to me how… quickly the developments just roll right through. 

02:05:40
YURI Yeah. 

02:05:40
ANDY It's really neat, you know, like from the last time to this time, all that processing, all of that we talked about, and felt in the last session and then having a really different experience with exercise this session, you know. This is really something. 

02:06:00
ELIZABETH I think it's shared with earlier at the end of the last session that the more that we try to suppress an emotion the more it wants to come out and the more it affects negatively impacts our life umm… and our relationships with ourselves and other people. Umm… I think that this umm… exercise and everything that we've done, you know, from the first three sessions has really taught us to explore our bodies, our minds, our thoughts, our emotions, and really just let them be and for me, it's umm… just I feel such serenity and such a sense of. Peace and it's very, very unusual for me to feel comfortable in silence and that's where I am right now. I'm in a very comfortable place of just serenity and inner silence, which is very wonderful for me. 

02:07:10
Summarization of 4 group sessions. 

02:07:10
ALLISON SPARGO And even though we struggled through experiencing those unpleasant emotions or unpleasant thoughts or problematic things that pop up. You guys did it. You processed through it, you were gentle with yourself, you remembered your breath as your anchor. And here we are, this group energy feels incredibly transformed from the first session to now, you feel it too?. 

02:07:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

02:07:35
ALLISON SPARGO And we know that groups provide the sense of comfort in that, in the time that we spent together but also the we form relationships that are gonna be meaningful even after we leave between sessions and after we finish that session. You'll remember that I was similar to Andy or, you know, you have these connections. So even if you don't remain connected in a personal relationship type of way that you'll feel that sense of… I'm not the only one, I'm not the only one. 

02:08:05
YURI I think that's what's helping me feel 'cause I don't… I accept thing that I don't have to feel like everyone makes me feel connected, which is weird because I don't know this experience is interesting, it's just interesting 'cause I did… I did feel the difference, you know, especially now. But I'm okay with not having anything to say like umm… it's weird to just accept yourself, like accept how you feel, don't ignore it, you know, but just listen… 

02:08:40
ANDY More or like where Elizabeth is right now. She's like I just don't have anything to say and that's really great. 

02:08:45
YURI I'm here though. 

02:08:45
ANDY Yeah. 

02:08:50
SHANE BLASKO It's a peace where, I can except I don't have to create a story about it. I can just be okay with it. 

02:08:55
KENZY Right. 

02:09:00
SHANE BLASKO That's tough though. It's not what I usually do. 

02:09:00
TEACHING Exploring how this group is a microcosm of society. 

02:09:00
ALLISON SPARGO And that's something important I think we can't even… I think we probably should touch on is that this is a unique experience right? So we learned this and this in group and although there are some facets of reality in this group and we brought our realities with us. The real world that waits for us out there and we might not have an hour to dedicate ourselves to sit and really be mindful, I mean, why we might forget that our breath is our anchor, you know, some of these things will come up and will maybe be stumbling blocks for us. 

02:09:30
ANDY Or for the people in our lives who aren't sitting in this room right now. 

02:09:40
Self-disclosure to normalize feelings. 

02:09:40
ALLISON SPARGO When I first started mindfulness this activity was one that I struggled with. I can partake of each one individually. So I can sit and be aware of my thoughts and I can sit and be aware of my emotions but putting it all together I felt like one had to come to the forefront like if I'm now attending to my thoughts then I can't be attending to my emotions if I'm attending to my emotions then I might lose track of my bodily sensations and that's something that's been a stumbling block for me is truly integrating all of these things. And then I realized I don't have to because in this present moment I am attending to fill in the blank, right, and to remind yourself, remind myself to be gentle. Do you see any other stumbling blocks, I see you nodding so you could see that be something that you would experience? 

02:10:20
[sil.] 

02:10:25
ANGELA It's just good to hear that we don't have to focus on one particular thing at one time. It's like okay, I can… I can be… I can just be whatever. 

02:10:35
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

02:10:35
ANGELA That's, that's just… it's just good for me I keep saying that because it is liberating, because of something that I've struggled with, you know, is having to be a certain way in this particular moment for someone else or even for myself but just, just me and it's okay. 

02:10:55
ALLISON SPARGO I think that's really liberating. 

02:10:55
ANGELA Very liberating. 

02:11:00
SHANE BLASKO You're reminding me something that was something like an instruction that was very helpful for me which was first give up the idea of perfection… 

02:11:10
UNKNOWN Right, right. 

02:11:10
ANDY Yeah. 

02:11:15
Group leader uses psychoeducation 

02:11:15
SHANE BLASKO I think this thing once you've given up the idea of, of being perfect then you can start working on, working towards mindfulness. 

02:11:20
DIANA And I think that we mentioned that maybe the first session someone said we're trying to focus on getting it right or how do we do it right. And so it's interesting to see how we've moved from that to here in just a couple sessions. 

02:11:35
ANDY Or questioning if, if how we were doing, it was right… or am I supposed to be having these feelings lately? 

02:11:45
Group taking ownership of new experiences. 

02:11:45
ANGELA I think that's why it's so liberating for me, umm… and I appreciate you sharing that because I'm a person who normally likes structure, a bit of a perfectionist, just a little bit. And so that's why this is so refreshing, for me, because I'm like okay, I have license just to be and it's okay, I have that freedom and, and just that, you know, that that liberty to just be it's okay, if everything doesn't fit in your specific square or box. It doesn't have to be checked off all the time. It's okay, just be present with that. So yeah, as a person who likes structure, I appreciate you saying that. This has really been eye opening for me. Just let it out. 

02:12:35
Group leader prompts discussion on application to life outside of group 

02:12:35
ALLISON SPARGO And just to remember that we've been together these four sessions. We had a pretty strong introduction to the material but when we go out there and we maybe want to share this experience with somebody else, to remember that it's the process, not the end goal. And that this is something that the processes of life time. 

02:13:00
AMY MCCLOUD Hi, we're back with Dr Allison Spargo and Dr Shane Blasko continuing our discussion about mindfulness based CBT in group counseling with the Adults. Allison and Shane welcome back. 

02:13:05
ALLISON SPARGO Thank you. 

02:13:10
AMY MCCLOUD So we just saw the last two sessions, can you summarize those words briefly? 

02:13:15
ALLISON SPARGO Absolutely so umm… in the third session we did a mindfulness based ùh CBT experience where there was a meditation and so what that looked like was umm… we always start and end with the bells. So Shane has these great bells that we'll just introduce umm… the meditation for our participants and so umm… the group really took ownership. You can actually see them kind of moving in their chairs and getting ready for the experience without us having to prompt them and so when we umm… introduced the meditation of mindfulness of thoughts, we really could see even on their facial expressions and in their body that they were that they were experiencing their umm… I'm sorry their feelings and so you could see that they were really experiencing their feelings. You could see some people uh… become more relaxed and you could visibly see some other participants getting, getting a little upset, having some uncomfortable experiences. And so the third session, we spent a lot of time umm… with that mindfulness meditation. However, it's gonna be edited out so you'll see in, in this that there's gonna be a lot of processing of what that experience was like. In the fourth session, we spent some time pulling it all together so we umm… invited our participants to experience what it's like to have umm… a bodily sensation and focusing on your breath, also to experience the mindfulness of thoughts to allow thoughts to come up, just labeling them as thoughts and not judging them, not being self-critical but just being aware of what's going on in the present moment umm… allowing those thoughts to maybe facility some feelings but what we're not, what we're not doing is trying to shift thoughts or shift feelings, but in someway we're just trying to create an awareness of what is and that acceptance of what is in this present moment. And so in that final session, we really allowed our participants to pull it all together to focus on their breathing, to explore their thoughts and their feelings, to let themselves just kind of wander and be curious about their experiences. And as, as we processed and summarize for that last group session, we explored umm… ways in which they're gonna move this material into their outside lives and this group did a lot of umm… fun exploring about how it's gonna impact their relationships maybe with other people. It's really neat to see. 

02:15:25
AMY MCCLOUD That's great, I mean, that's sort of what you hope for with, with any counseling but particularly with group counseling that they take what they've learned a group and are able to generalize it to their life outside of group. 

02:15:30
ALLISON SPARGO Absolutely. 

02:15:30
AMY MCCLOUD Yeah, okay, neat. And so what do you think helped the group members get to that place where they were able to really take ownership and transfer the learning? 

02:15:40
ALLISON SPARGO Umm… I think it kind of goes back to the, the initial screening process, the initial introduction to the material and then also umm… again just the working alliance with Shane and I, and their group cohesion. So even if, uh… you might notice that one participant or a few participants kind of wander and we all do and groups, it's hard to stay focused for such a one for sure. 

02:16:00
AMY MCCLOUD Sure. 

02:16:00
ALLISON SPARGO And so when they wonder that they. If they experienced, a critical self judgmental moment that their group members kind of reminded them, "Hey, that's what this is about," and if you were that or if you even engaged in self-criticism. That's okay, we still do that. We're new at this, and so I think they did it for themselves in some ways, I think we get a little bit of credit for the introductions but really, this group was an outstanding uh… a group of participants. 

02:16:25
AMY MCCLOUD Okay so it sounds like what you really achieve, what you were hoping to achieve with this group about teaching them about mindfulness and then having them take ownership of those concepts and put them into practice in their life in the group and then in their life outside of the group as well. 

02:16:40
ALLISON SPARGO Yes. Absolutely. 

02:16:40
AMY MCCLOUD Great. So what did you learn from this experience? 

02:16:45
ALLISON SPARGO That's a really great question. So I learned that umm… you know, I mentioned in the initial, in the introduction to this that I really like to overprepare and I've learned again that, that feeling of comfort that I experience as a facilitator of having a lot of material is great and then also, I also have was reminded that, you know, just attending to the group process is something that's incredibly important to. So it's safe for me to have a lot of material but it's also a privilege to just be part of a group process. 

02:17:20
AMY MCCLOUD Sure. 

02:17:20
SHANE BLASKO And then something for me that I learned again, is that umm… those places where umm… I make mistakes are just as informative and just as helpful, as the places where I feel like we did things, I did things correctly. Umm… so you'll see on the video umm… that there are places where umm… I made mistakes 'cause we were not editing those out. But they're, they're just as useful for learning what to do and what not to do with leading a group. Umm… and they were just as helpful if not more helpful for me and for the group members. 

02:18:00
AMY MCCLOUD Right 'cause I think they're certainly gonna come up in real life and your facilitating it. 

02:18:00
SHANE BLASKO Absolutely. 

02:18:00
AMY MCCLOUD Right and I think one of the umm… benefits of this demonstration is that we did have the opportunity to have both of you co-facilitate the group, can you just talk a little bit about what that process was like and sort of the benefits of having a co-facilitator? 

02:18:15
ALLISON SPARGO Absolutely, well, I am extremely grateful for Shane participating as umm… my co-facilitator. Umm… the, the process of co-facilitation is somewhat different from a single facilitator and I think that umm… for me, I prefer a co-facilitator. 

02:18:30
SHANE BLASKO Me too. 

02:18:30
ALLISON SPARGO I know that there are times when I'm so focused on maybe one individual member or a dialogue that might be going on that I've lost focus of other experiences that maybe going on and it's hard to catch every eye roll or every sawyer, you know, everything that's going on in a room or every smile or head, nod of the head and so, umm… for me, there's again, a sense of safety and comfort in having a facilitator to also kind of keep, keep an eye or keep finger on the pulse of, you know, of those types of things. 

02:19:00
SHANE BLASKO Yeah, I agree I always prefer to when leading a group too go lead, I knew that there are many people who prefer to lead groups by themselves and not to say that there's anything wrong with that but my personal preference is always to go lead, I can always trust that. I can check and see if my co-leader is focusing on the person who is speaking that I know that I'm free to be paying attention to the rest of the group or vice versa. Umm… I just… I find great comfort in knowing that if, if one of us is missing something, the other one is likely catching it and then there's always that opportunity after group for the two of us to process it and, and umm… I just get so much out of that processing after the fact as well. 

02:19:40
AMY MCCLOUD Right, yeah I agree with you. I think it's critically important. There's so much going on content wise and process wise that it's always seems impossible for one, for one person to really effectively manage that. 

02:19:50
ALLISON SPARGO Yeah. 

02:19:50
AMY MCCLOUD So what was your processing like out for this group, any insights that you would mind, would you mind sharing? 

02:19:55
SHANE BLASKO Well, I mean, I think I've already shared some of, some of what it was, for me, anyway. One of the things that I did process with Alison afterwards was that that gained insight, for me which again happens for me a lot which is that, you know, learned again how much I learned from making mistakes again but that was, you know, one of the things we processed a lot about umm… some of the different group members umm… as some members to umm… did share some things that were umm… pretty challenging for them umm… one of the things that we processed umm… was having to, you know, how to manage that after the fact with the tape because that's an element that we're not used to having, when leading groups. 

02:20:40
ALLISON SPARGO Sure. And also I think, I think some of the things that we also processed were that there were some members who are a little bit more quiet and some members who are much more vocal and how to, and, we've, we process that kind of in between sessions as well. How to draw out the quiet members and how to umm… encourage the more vocal members to, to become more equal participants but also not invite them down. And so we processed that little bit umm… like Shane mentioned, there are always opportunities for better group facilitation and so even in my head when I'm thinking, "Oh man, I should have said that or I missed an opportunity," that in most groups if, if it's something that's important for the group it'll come back around. 

02:21:20
AMY MCCLOUD Right… 

02:21:20
ALLISON SPARGO And so to remember to, to just gonna be gentle on yourself as a group facilitator umm… so those were some of the things that that we processed and that I learned as a result of leading this group. 

02:21:30
AMY MCCLOUD Sure, and what tips do you have for someone who might be thinking about leading a mindfulness based CBT group? 

02:21:40
ALLISON SPARGO Absolutely, so actually umm… many of our participants like Shane mentioned were either counseling interns or umm… Struggling to become professional counselors and as a result of their participation in this group, they uh… left excited to learn more and I think if somebody was interested in leading a mindfulness CBT infused or… you know, group of this, of this style, that one of the first places to go is to learn more about mindfulness. Mindfulness is something that's kind of up and coming umm… as far as umm… use in the counseling field, you know, it's not something that might be taught in more traditional university. So I think just becoming proficient at what mindfulness is, we learn a lot about CBT so you can infuse the CBT aspect into it, you know, in a way that makes meaning for you as a facilitator and for you, for you and your clients. Umm… but I think that the first place to start would become much more proficient in mindfulness and they're certainly training something that will help, help you do that. 

02:22:30
AMY MCCLOUD So educating yourself or maybe even practicing it personally, like you both mentioned. 

02:22:35
SHANE BLASKO Oh, absolutely practicing it yourself. I think if you're going to use mindfulness with clients whether an individual in a group setting, you want to be practicing it. Have, have your own practice on a daily basis or, you know, have your own practice for, you know, quite a while. It's not something you wanna be doing with clients until you have a really good sense of what this is like for you so you can understand how to explain it to clients, how you can have a good understanding of how to help them work through the ins and outs of it. 

02:23:05
ALLISON SPARGO And this is not, I mean, this is not a Relaxation Skill Strategy. This is… 

02:23:10
SHANE BLASKO Right. 

02:23:10
ALLISON SPARGO …something that's very different so umm… some, some members did experience relaxation as a kind of byproduct… 

02:23:15
SHANE BLASKO Right. 

02:23:15
ALLISON SPARGO …of the mindfulness experience but this is not skills training for relaxation. This is… 

02:23:20
SHANE BLASKO Right. 

02:23:20
ALLISON SPARGO …right on this which is very different. So if you're teaching breathing to a client that to notice the difference that it might not be your breath as your anchor in the mindfulness way but that you might be teaching more relaxation skills. So again, like you said it goes back to educating yourself and practicing and, and feeling what is like in the moment. 

02:23:40
AMY MCCLOUD And do you think the practice of mindfulness in the group studying impacted the group process in anyway? 

02:23:45
ALLISON SPARGO Yes. 

02:23:45
SHANE BLASKO Absolutely, yes and… 

02:23:50
ALLISON SPARGO So that the group came in and obviously, you know, this is a unique context right? So how many times have we led groups of cameras and how many times and if it's been… if it's been filmed and so I think that there were a lot of nerves initially and umm… through even the body scan, there were so a lot of like a feeling of unsettledness I think for some of the group participants and as we moved into the mindfulness of thoughts and just reiterated how to not be judgmental or how to not be critical… self-critical, the group atmosphere totally shifted and it changes every time we, we do a mindfulness CBT Based activity. And so the group starts with their energy, we do the activity and then throughout the process there is a totally different energy within that group, within group members and also the engagement and the cohesion of the group. 

02:24:40
SHANE BLASKO In the research on mindfulness based CBT, umm… therapy isn't, isn't quite what it is with mindfulness yet, but mindfulness meditation research, there's quite a bit of research that's talks about what the changes are in the brain from doing that and so just from what we know from that we know that we're seeing so many changes in the brain that it's very relatable to understand if we start looking at that research we can say okay, there are changes and the structures of the brain. There are changes in the neural pathways in the brain so much so that we know that what's happening, what we saw happened with our group members in the sessions, in these group sessions. It's very understandable and very relatable so we can say okay, doing this type of work, we're going to see changes in an individual session with clients if we do mindfulness CBT work with their clients if we do it in the group session with them. We're going to see some, something happen that's different than if we just talk about it umm… because when you're talking about things, you're talking about just things happening in the frontal lobe. When you actually engage in these activities and we're getting deeper processing further into the brain, where we're actually engaging in different processes. 

02:26:00
AMY MCCLOUD So really helping clients participate, you're the participants umm… engage in the here now, in the moment you're saying this… 

02:26:05
SHANE BLASKO Absolutely. 

02:26:05
AMY MCCLOUD …positive benefits… 

02:26:05
SHANE BLASKO Absolutely. 

02:26:05
AMY MCCLOUD …of mindfulness. Great. what closing word did you have for someone who might be considering this type of group? 

02:26:15
SHANE BLASKO I highly encourage it, if someone is really interested in getting involved in this, I highly encourage them to start learning about and start practicing mindfulness and start, you know, learning about mindfulness CBT if this is something that interests them umm… start engaging in it, learning about it, umm… if they're interested in, in doing it in a group setting that's fantastic, they're interested in getting to that point where they're practicing. It's that they can… that one day themselves lead a group like this. I think that will be excellent. 

02:26:45
ALLISON SPARGO And I think my only, my only closing remarks were… would be something to the effect of umm… patience that this is a process and sometimes, it is a little bit uncomfortable to simply be but that's the point of Mindfulness Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, is to simply engage actively in the moment and not be judgmental to be patient with yourself and if you feel restless or frustrated to engage but that's part of the process too that this is a lifelong endeavor and you will never be perfect at it. There's no end going there. There is no 100%, it's just as much as you can give in each given moment. 

02:27:20
AMY MCCLOUD Thank you.
