  This is really an incredible honor and ah, privilege for me to introduce one of the most remarkable and amazing women in Psychology today. As I just, I'm sure many people feel so incredibly fondly of Dr. Rosie Philips Bingham. Uhm, I can just reflect on the time when I was a new professional hmm, 14 years ago, whatever. And I just think about the people that have been so instrumental in my own development and who has served as role models and mentors and, and Rosie is like number one on the list. I really wanna thank you for that. And I'm sure she has served in that role for a number of people here in this room. Okay, uhm, why don't I go ahead and start with the formal introductions and then, I also wanna just thank personally thank Rosie for few other things that she's done for the profession. Dr. Rosie being a Philips-Bingham is a native uhm, Memphian. She received a Bachelors Degree in Sociology and Education from Elmhurst College, and received the Masters of Arts Degree in Counseling and Guidance, and Doctorate in Counseling Psychology from the Ohio State University. She started her career uhm, in Higher Education at the Ohio State University and moved to the University of Florida in 1978. Dr. Bingham was Associate Director of the Counseling Center at the University of Flora, Florida before uhm, prior to being hired as a Director for the Center for the Student Development at the University of Memphis in 1985. She held this position until 1993, when she became the Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs in Student Development. After Nark, National Search uhm, Dr. Bingham was selected as Vice President For Student Affairs, a couple of years ago, and has arctic, uhm, articulated a vision mission of students learning through engagement and involvement. They're so lucky to have you there. Dr. Bingham is a prolific writer, presenter, and holds a diplomat in Counseling Psychology. She has served as President of three National Professional Organizations uhm, the Association Of University in College Counseling Center Directors, the International Association of Counseling Services and the Coun, the Society of Counseling Psychology of the American Psychological Association. Uhm, as people, most people here now along with Doctors, Melba Vasquez, Derald Wing Sue, and Dr. Lisa Porche-Burke, that Rosie Bingham was one of the co-founding organizers of the National Multicultural Conference and Summit. And so we really wanna acknowledged and thank you all for that visionary leadership (clapping) because without that, we would not be here today. Uhm, she was selected, she, I mean her leadership is just phenomenal when you asked anybody about Doctor Bingham Melpha(ph) that it talked about her leadership skills and what she's brought to the discipline. She was selected as one of the, of 15 women from around the world to participate in the Women of Color Development ah, Incubator project, funded by the Kellogg Foundation. And has use the training in her role as chair of the board of the Women's Foundation for greater Memphis. I could lively go on and on and on about her recognitions but I won't. I would though like just it take a couple of moments to thank Rosie on behalf of the Summit and the Division Presidents for her tireless commitment and leadership to diversity issues throughout her entire career. But more specifically this recent bid for APA Presidency and we just appreciate all that you have done in terms of your time, your own money, your commitment and really running a diversity platform and she's brought awareness to APA membership, the issues at the Summit is really about issues dealing with diversity, in equity, in excellence, in social justice and inclusion all that are so important and all that we hoped that you will continue the struggle and run again because I really do believe through persistence and struggle that we will prevail. So, please join me in thanking and recognizing Doctor Bingham for her remarkable leadership and her efforts.

  Thank you so much for everything. 

00:04:55
ROSIE BINGHAM  Thank you. Hmm.

00:05:00
ROSIE BINGHAM  I am deeply, deeply honored to be one of your keynote speakers today at this National Multicultural Conference and Summit that has already been so awesome and I just want us to again, because you can't do it too much thank our organizers. (claps) 

00:05:35

00:05:35
ROSIE BINGHAM  Okay, so up here, one near panic attack on one real panic attack in my life. The near panic attack was when at the Division 17 meeting last year, someone said, "well, we want you to keynote the Multicultural Conference and Summit," I said, " Oh no, uh-uh not me." Because I got to tell you when the idea for the Summit was conceived, Dr. Lisa Porche-Burke, Lisa stand up and wave. C'mon Lisa. (clapping) She's so skinny now we've might not be able to see her. (laughing) Lisa was President of Division 45. Derald Wing Sue had been elected President of Division 45. Dr. Melba Vasquez had been elected President of 35, and I of 17. And we are really, really wanted our presidencies to mean something. And so, at a bar, at the capital Hilton hotel (laughing) in Washington D.C., we got drunk. (laughing) No, a, actually I didn't even drink back then. (laughing) They changed my behavior. (laughing) We conceived of the idea of the Summit and then we said, " What if we could get a couple of hundred people to come out and talk about cutting-edge research, practice, education, and training in this whole multicultural area." Do you think we could get 200 people to do that? Well of course the summit sold-out and surpassed our wildest expectations and we had nearly 600 people come. 

00:07:40
[sil.] 

00:07:40
ROSIE BINGHAM  So now, many of you out there are still a researchers, practitioners, trainers, and educators so what in the world do I have to say to you, I don't have any late breaking research. I don't have any noble procedures for those of you who are clinicians so that you can go back and really help your clients with the PTSD and paranoia. And I don't particularly like teaching, so I don't have anything to tell you about teaching. (laughing) But I did wonder, who nurtures each of you in this fight, this multicultural battle everyday and just as surely as I stand here this afternoon, I know there a lot of battles out there. The battles are with our colleagues who tell us to talk about something else other than multiculturalism. The battles are in the classrooms when only the students of color will speak up when multicultural is the topic of the day. The battles are with the agencies who want you to come and do multicultural training for free while their bottom lines get bigger with no real change. So sometimes I know that even today, the fight for multiculturalism can get a little lonely. So, I stop by here to tell you that you don't have to be alone because there is power in inclusion. We fight the daily battles with oppression. Empowerment can be found through inclusion to help us with that. So in the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., we as a people will get where? To the promise land. I believe that it is difficult to know who we are as a people and what in the world is the promise land. Well that means, that there is a place for you to be you and me to be me, a place where it is okay for you to kneel and pray six times the day with your head covered. A place where you can love whom ever you want to. A place where you can be Jewish, Christian, where you can you sit in a wheelchair, be Asian, gay, and President of the United States. (clapping) It is a place where we can do our best so this world can be its best. Now, I realize I'll be dead then. (laughing) And I really hope I'll be fertilizer for some call it greens. But we as a people will get there. Those toiling in the fields must continue to toil and help each other. At the last summit, and those of you who weren't there, you hear us talk about this because it has such a riveting and profound effect on all of us. But I believe that it was Derald Wing Sue who said and if it wasn't Derald, whoever that wise person was thank you. As we struggled with the heartache brought on by a seeming conflict between our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters and our Black sisters and brothers, we seem to be embroiled in Derald's words of saying, "Who has the most blood on the floor." And it is true that we are all still bleeding. It is true that in this corner slavery happen. The middle passage was real. We did have to lie like spoons and rest in each others excrements as we crossed the Atlantic to work in America, home of the free where the natives were driven off their land to reservations and the Negroes had to work without wages. It is true that even today we still wear the shackles of slavery when we find more African-American males in jail than in College, there is blood on the floor. And in this corner they're Chinese-Americans who were brought to North America to replace Black slave labor and who could not give testimony in a court and had to pay a police tax and who built the first transcontinental railroad though they were considered Heathens before they became a model minority. They were excluded from America in 1882 and were massacred at Rock Spring, there is blood on the floor. And in this corner, they're the Japanese who were to be the chief labor to replace the Chinese and yet they suffered the alien land, law, and internment camps. There is blood on the floor and in this corner are native Americans who were 10 million strong when the Mayflower arrived. But according to Tommy Flamewalker Manasco, are many nations once stood tall and range from shore to shore but most are gone and few remain and the buffaloes roam no more, there is blood on the floor. And there's still more corners, concentration camps happened, the Palestinians deserve a homeland and 42 states received an F for the abysmal lack of protection of human rights and dignity for all students in the states and Matthew Shepard and Brandon Tina(ph) dared to live and did not deserve to die. And Stonewall in 1969 was, and I am appalled, I am appalled by walls on the U.S.-Mexican boarder. There is blood on the floor. 

00:15:25

00:15:25
ROSIE BINGHAM  But, I stop by here to tell you that you make a difference and if we come together, we have power. When I sent in the title of this talk, "Empowerment through Inclusion" in the daily battle with oppression, I was in the middle of running for the presidency of APA and soliciting evaluations from the executive director of the board of the Women's Foundation for Greater Memphis. That board's agenda is to raise money to give to programs and services that help women reach economic self sufficiency. The group had raise the largest amount in its 11-year history toward our annual fund and has surpassed by tens of thousands of dollars, its goal we'd raise nearly one million dollars that year. In addition, that same board had agreed to raise just over 7 million dollars in order for Memphis to receive two Hood Grants(ph) worth 20 million dollars each to tear down ramshackled poverty-ridden projects and to rebuild those communities. While the board has five years to raise that money and just over one year we raise three and a half million dollars. I'd call that outstanding and I know you would too. But as I solicited the evaluations for that executive director who is African-American, one of her evaluate is that, I'm sure she does the best that she can but and I quote, "in a perfect world, proper use of the English language should be so universal that the author should only be identifiable as an American, as oppose to a foreign born speaker of the language." Now the executive directors from Mississippi, (laughing) and roughly the same period I ran for president of APA and I received some interesting e-mails, one of them told me not to talk about multicultural matters, I was broader than that. Another told me that, although I gave a nice talk at the Council of Representatives plenary session that she wanted to make sure that I didn't use her name in any of my campaign materials and she didn't want me to misrepresent her. Now, really neither one of them will plan to vote for me anyway. And I do realize that when any of us decide to do a high profile kind of a job that the slings and arrows will come but they still sting. And each of this instances, I turn to my circle of colleagues and friends, 'coz I've got good friends, to make the wounds less deep. And I decided to talk about it at this summit 'coz I knew and have a lot of friends in my circle. Empowerment through the inclusion, through inclusion in the daily battle with oppression. Now, Louis(ph), Louis Collin Constantine(ph) would say that my means of coping with what I call daily oppressions fit right in with the styles of coping that African-American women use when they perceive institutional and cultural racism, cognitive, emotional debriefing, spiritual centered, and collective coping. So you know, it always makes me feel a whole lot better when we get their science and research, that you've research is out there to, to back up my lived experience. 

00:20:05
[sil.] 

00:20:05
ROSIE BINGHAM  Ah, the other reason that I chose the title, to specially include the words "daily oppression" is because, since I've been a vice-president, I have been asked questions by young professionals at APA, by graduate and undergraduate students around the country, and by some of you, a science students to call and talk to and interview a living older psychologist. (laughing) So they asked me, "Do you have experience, racism and sexism?" (laughing) And I tell them, "only everyday." And also tell them that most of it is not intentional nor malevolent. And then, I refer them to John D. Video(ph) and his colleagues so they can learn about aversive racism, modern racism, implicit racism, all of that stuff. I tell them that sometimes the little oppressions are small like the other night, I was in my office working on the computer, another Black woman came in and pluck in the vacuum, she was vacuuming the office and the fuse blew, neither one of us could work anymore. So, I called around so I could get some help and this guy said, "I will come over in about 15 minutes dear." Now, some people say that black folk are really sensitive to this stuff and women overly sensitive but I don't think I was. The other times, the events are little larger as when all of the vice-presidents except me were invited to go to a plan and session with our wealthy donors and I accidentally discovered that they were all going the day before they were to leave. Or when I am pushed and prodded and told I absolutely have to come to this evening dinner and the president and all the other vice-presidents are sitting in a table up near the front and I sit in the back with the secretaries and the assistants too(ph). I have no problem with sitting with the secretaries but I swear, I thought we had legislation that said, I no longer had to sit at the back of the bus. Or when I go out to dinner and they berate(ph) me to the sit in the back by the restaurant. Or when my colleagues carefully explain something in my area of responsibility because I don't know what I am doing. Or when I disagree with one of my, my colleagues, and he angrily tells me, "I'm just really surprise I have to tell you this about the Black experience." (laughing) And shortly after 9/11, I began to always allow extra time at the airport so that I could have my random search because 100 percent of the time, I was selected. (clapping) Then change until the computer started picken' people. Now, when APA (coughs) was a, in Honol, in Honolulu in 2004 and I think this is the last time I was randomly selected. Six of us, who all Black decided to slip away from the conference and fly over to Maui. (laughing) Going and coming back, all six of us were searched. I call that our little reward for skipping out on the conference. (laughing) I call events like this, "my daily oppressions." I was delighted when I learn that Derald Wing Sue and his colleagues recently gave voice to this labels. They call this things, "micro-insults" and " micro-invalidations." So what I call "daily oppression," researchers label "micro-aggressions." Sue and his colleagues define racial micro-aggressions as brief and common place daily verbal behavior, verbal behavioral and environmental indignities whether intentional or unintentional that communicate hostility, derogatory or negative racist(ph) lies and insults that potentially have harm, harmful or unpleasant psychological impact on the target person or group. And what makes all of this stuffs so debilitating, is that it is cumulative. Their even more of them if you have several identities and I want you to use your imagination for a moment, I've use the power point but I really like to use your imaginations better. So see a woman whose African-American and lesbian. Trussing a male in a wheelchair now make him Latino. How about seeing a male whose 4 feet 5 inches tall, White, and using a walker. Now make him gay or agent. The micro attacks grow exponentially. Imagine being big Black and male. I served on an Admission's Committee of a counseling Psychology program and I was rebutting one of my colleagues' reasons for not letting an African male, African-American male into the graduate program. Well, after I've rebutted all the argument she said to me, "well, maybe it's just that he is a big Black man." He did not get into the program. We have to wonder what is the psychological toll that results from daily oppression and micro aggressions. Tony Brown who's a critical race theorist says that, "racial stratification can cause mental health problems, not systematically described in the existing literature or psychiatric knowsology." While Brown spents much of his time in discourse on Blacks and Whites. I believe his conclusions and recommendations regarding this, the critical study of race cannot be applied to all minorities in the United States. He maintains that mental health researchers must theorize at greater depth like critical race theorist do, about the experiential meaning of being Black or White in the United States to more fully characterized the empirical relationship between race and mental health. I really appreciate the call for more scientific evidence of this relationship between racial micro aggressions or oppressions and mental health because once again it fits my lived experience and that of many of my friends and colleagues to attribute the behavior of a White male professor who called me as smart as Nigger to his wife's illness is oppressive. Today my ideas as ordinary on Monday but the same idea is brilliant on Wednesday when my White male colleague delivers it is discouraging. And the classroom to over look the raised hands of students of color is demoralizing. To be the one official, not recognized in the face of acknowledging all of your White peers confirms invisibility. Sitting through meetings when we make statements that we were only giving scholarships to the most qualified students as defined by the ACT when we all know the work of clod(ph) steel(ph) that's toughest descent genius. And when you wanna touch my hair, when I go on a job interview it's insulting, so you don't even believe it's true but it is. And to be constantly paid less is taxing and then I say well, no it's not taxing it's depressing . Do you know that according to some 2045 data that if a woman graduates from high school, she can expect to earn about $21,973. But a male will earn $30,868 and then with a professional degree, you can earn more money. Roughly $55,000 but the gas was gonna get $90,650. To have to always fight for your rights, drains the energy of even the best of us. Now, as aside no(ph) Linda Forrest, are you in the house? Linda in 1994, I was along uhm, executive on the division 17, executive board and it was proposed that we designate one of our three counsel of representative seats to an ethnic minority. And Lord I sure didn't wanna fight that battle but Linda Forrest and Linda Brooke(ph), took on that battle. And I did not have to do it. 

00:30:40

00:30:40
ROSIE BINGHAM  And then for the summit John Westerville, well, people were telling me there ain't any money for the Multi-Cultural Summit, John pulled me inside and said; "There's money. I'll lead the discussion, we'll get you the money." I appreciate my White allies, my friends. 

00:31:05
[sil.] 

00:31:05
ROSIE BINGHAM  But even with this help I still had to go back to my room and eat chocolate and peanuts. Brown says there is a link between African-American women who deny discriminatory encounters and hypertension. And that kind of eating maybe pauses the, now, I actually I don't have hypertension, thank God. But all of my other five sisters and some of my brothers have hypertension. The research is becoming quite clear that the "isms" in our society are deleterious to our health and well being. So consistent with the research I do intentionally seek the support of my cultural and ethnic sisters to get me through. Further, I am a deeply spiritual woman so I do rely on a higher power to make my days lighter. Each of this is a coping strategy that Lo, Louis Collin Constantine's research validates that it's alright. (laughs) So I ask each of you to lift your eyes from the blood on the floor and look up to find common ground. My Angelo as she's been quoted out day says that " we cannot unlive the past but if we understand it we do not have to relive it." All our parents have left much blood on the floor and we can spend generations fighting for revenge but I encourage you to never forget the past but forgive the wrongs. And always understand that there is a Promise Land. We just have to look up and grab it. How do I know there is a Promise Land? Well, actually ah, I review my own life but you know, Madam speaker of the House and you know ah, goodness gracious, Barack is in the race. And Hilary is in the race and Richardson is in the race. My God when did we ever have a woman, a Black guy, and a Latino running for President of the United States. (applause) 

00:33:45
[sil.] 

00:33:45
ROSIE BINGHAM  We're standing in the Promise Land and then I look at my own identities. I am the daughter of a garbage man, the daughter of an alcoholic, the daughter of a man who hit his wife. The daughter of a man who work two full time jobs to put bread on the table and shoes on the feet of my other 11 brothers and sisters who gave me a direct blood transfusion when I was a little kid facing death. And then all of my sisters and brothers at least finish high school and some of them living relatively middle class life until they got broke and came back home and live with my mama (laughs) but, but then we got out it all, was a testament to the many villagers who were a part, not part of the family but who were part of the neighborhood and help to raise all of us. They gave guidance and food. They told our parents when, we we're doing wrong or spank us themselves. Just, as our parents, my own parents would take in kids to live with us in those four rooms because they need it, shelter a roof overhead. So sometimes we were more than 12 but that was alright. Those other children needed us to survive and thrive. Just us our group here is inclusive of age, sexual orientation, spiritual orientation, race ability class, ethnicity, and gender. All of us need each other to survive. So as I stand here talking to you, I am standing in the Promise Land. It's so easy to fall victim to in-group behavior and to divide ourselves on the basis of some trait is easy, maybe a natural to exclude, to have a little something is just the little, but we think we have to hold on to it or we will surely die. But it is important to understand that we need to have a collective agenda because inclusion is power. I've gone all except to drink the water from my is it, has it happen in the rest of you? Yeah, okay. More than a decade ago at the University of Memphis, we started to lobby the University, to begin developing programs for Latino and Hisp, or Hispanics. We say Hispanics in Memphis because a few had enter the universicly, University and, and really my reasoning was that I'd look at what had happened in Californian thought well, okay let's go ahead and get started on this and I'd seen the cooperation in division 45. And I'd seen the transformation in 17 as we develop the more inclusive agenda. And it was clear that those divisions were succeeding more because they were collective but my University's response was, well, you know, our Black students are in largest minority and the moneys that we have appropriated for the minorities will go to them. But fast forward ten years later and now the Hispanic students are in large enough number, enough numbers that they say. [non-English narration] what about us. Now, hardly anybody at our University can speak Spanish. But since the University wants to be bigger, you know what we're doing, we're going out looking for those brown Spanish speaking people. We want them now because we need to be bigger. Now, the Latino students on our campus have formed a group the Hispanic Student Association. The group is becoming a force because they recognized that they, if they are to have power they have to be inclusive together the students can confront their daily doses of micro aggression. Where those students, our students merely focus on the blood on the floor, they would not have been able to look up and see who else they needed to include in their group because though they were small in number they say anybody can be a member of the Hispanic Student Association so they are now a force on the campus. Ah, this pass for my University had a chance to be really, really divided. There was a young freshman student, I love this students because they ah, looked over all of the stereotypes. Young white male about this tall, who's a freshmen Dave(ph) an African-American about this tall who's a junior and he was pledging a traditionally white fraternity. And he took his girlfriend to the, to the frat house. And one of his brothers said oh! you date Negroes now and told them not to bring her back to the fraternity house. With a young man hailed on to that message for about a week but on a Friday he finally told his girlfriend and some of her friends well you know, we were about to have a riot. I was in New York and they went and told the director of our African-American studies program and she immediately e-mailed me and I mean le, begin to work on it. Well, I came back to town and on Monday the headline broke about the story. On Tuesday morning students, the president of student government, the vice-president, the president of the BSA all in my office saying what are we going to do? The black students were beginning to see blood on the floor. But what, what was truly amazing was the speed at which those students organize for rally for wins the afternoon. Perhaps, more amazing was such a diverse group of students all the other white sororities and fraternities. All the other ethnic groups join together and said not on my campus. The faculty send in and the staff, send in followed the students lead and join them. Empowerment through inclusion. Now, don't believe for one moment of course I guess you wouldn't believe that, that our campus is a parliana(ph) our counseling psych faculties are white we've never had a visible ethic minority we have someone for valid year one time ah, all the deans of white males except for guess what the Dean of Nursing and the Dean of Libraries is a black female. The cheers are at least 90 percent why and mostly male and why really most of them is white but (laughing) for a moment our students got it right. Our students got it right because they step back for enough to see the bigger picture. The students knew and know they won a great university. For that greatness to happen it can't be about me and my group, striking how our perspective changes when we fly high enough above the clouds and begin to imagine the possibilities. So, three white guys calling a young woman a Nigger began to look small back comparison 200 who came out with candles and commitment to say "not on my watch." The power of inclusion makes change happen. Now just review the timeline for the adaption of the Multi-Cultural guidelines. Allen Ivey appoint it when he was President of Division 17 a young Derald Wing Sue (laughing) to cheer a task force to come up with the guidelines and I did but they just languish there. And so Derald and company took them to ACA and he with Patricia Arredondo and Rod McDavis you can read their work, help to get them pass in ACA and then we got them back into APA and with the riding team lead by Nadia Ford and Patricia Arredondo, the guidelines became APA Policy in 2002. For those guidelines to become policy in APA we had to draw a big circle of inclusion. Psychologists from all races, sexes, orientations, ages, abilities, scientists, practitioners, and I was on counsel the day that those guidelines passed. And I got to tell you there was joy in the morning. And counsel, counsel we as a people at counsel had a moment of being bigger than we ever were and more powerful than we thought we could be, is important for us you have the summit to recall that at the end of the first summit there was a call for adaption of those guidelines. Now, I wonder what will the participants had this summit call for. We recall on our profession to do something to be more inclusive to be more empowering, to fight the daily micro-aggressions launched against people who have thin blood on the floor, where we challenge each other to act up and act out in outlandish ways. There were herald(ph) big changes that elevate each of us and make the world a better place. Were we walk away from this summit feeling empowered so that we live to fight another day. Were we understand what Angela Davis meant when she wrote if they come in the morning voices of resistance in this book she says "if they come for me in the morning they will be for you tonight if they don't come for you because of your skin color they will come for you because your a woman." In just the last hour 80 women were raped. And we are afraid of the night but in 1976 an inclusive group of women in Belgium empowered themselves and said were taking back the night. How shall we empower ourselves? We need a big inclusive group of men and women to take back the piece. Are we able to make a statement about the war in Iraq? Where are our voices? Surely, surely they have not been drowned by the blood on the floor. Do we have (inaudible ) a something about those individuals dying mentally and physically on the battlefield when the Nazis came for the communist I remain silent. I was not a communist. When they locked up the Social Democrats I remain silent because I was not a Social Democrat. When they came for the Trade Unionist I did not speak out, I was not a Trade Unionist. When they came for me there was no one left to speak out. Thus, this inclusive group at the summit have the power to say anything. If we don't have the power to say anything my challenge to you is that each of us returns for our individual homes and look to see if we can include just one somebody whom we overlooked in one statement that renders a colleague invisible. Challenge one stereotype that is nothing more than a micro aggression. For just one day go outside of yourself and discover the needs of another person. Adjust one event, adjust one event ask at least one of the least of these to sit at the VIP table for just one day. If you think you cannot relate to someone who is different from you then list all of your identities and just in case anybody is tired, let me ask you to stand if I can put you in one of my identities. Black woman, Christian, loser, winner, guilt ridden, over 50, daughter, mother, aunt, psychologist, outsider or insider, privilege lover. If I can do that and look out and see that you match my identities I can draw a bigger(ph) inclusive group. You may be seated.

ROSIE BINGHAM  So just get outside of yourself, get outside of yourself. One of my sisters wrote that, she thought that Joshua do that too. Now the price you pay to be inclusive to make a difference will be ah, smaller than the price paid by Viola Liuzzo, the only white woman to have been murdered during the Civil Rights Marches. She was a 39-year-old teamster's wife who lived in Detroit but just had to go to Selma. She had five young children but she went to fight for voting rights for African-Americans. And you know I can just see her on that Patty's Bridge in that march from Selma, but Viola was killed by the Ku Klux Klan. Her killers were captured surely after the event but they got off because there was a smear campaign that says she came down there to sleep with black men. Her blood is on the floor. But one glorious standing(ph) was ask, why would she do such a thing. She said "empathy is the most revolutionary of feelings." As psychologist we try to be empathic. I ask that we be more inclusive and that we empower others and that we be intentional in that empowering and although there is blood on the floor one of the things that you can do with that blood is we can all be blood brothers and sisters if we will be more inclusive because inclusion is power. Thank you so much.

00:50:20
  You are so impressive.
