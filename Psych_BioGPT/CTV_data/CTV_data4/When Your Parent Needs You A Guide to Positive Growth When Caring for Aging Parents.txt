BETH WITROGEN MCLEOD My father had battled cancer for about 25 years and he had always dodged the bullet and we… he thought he was kind of immortal. My mother had had trouble with her hands, we thought it was, was Arthritis, but in fact we found out it was Lou Gehrig's disease. 

00:01:10

00:01:25
AVRENE BRANDT The way I actually became aware of caregiving was because my mother was a caregiver for my father. My father had a stroke, which left him both cognitively and physically impaired. My mother was a, the classical caregiver and she experienced all the stresses that caregivers, you know, experience. 

00:01:45

Becoming the caregiver for your Parent 

00:02:20
DAVID KAMPMAN Becoming the caregiver for your parent is something none of us expects to do. We associate life with our parents, but suddenly we are taking care of the ones who diapered us, fed us, and taught us about life. Here we are now diapering and feeding them, and we may find this a heartbreaking experience.

Treva Whichard 

00:02:45
Caregiver for her mother, Mildred 

00:02:45
TREVA WHICHARD Here I am 54 and I thought, you know, I was going to be doing was, going to work at this time of my life and playing with grandchildren and never and never crossed my mind that I would have to take care of my mother that I would have to be a mother to my mother. 

00:03:00
DAVID KAMPMAN Treva Whichard's mother, Mildred was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease about a year ago. Her mother lived in another state at that time. Treva felt her mother could not live on her own any longer, and made the decision to move to Mildred to the state where Treva resides. Mildred stayed in previous home with her for five weeks, then after much discussion with family and friends Treva helped her mother move into an assisted living facility for the memory impaired. 

00:03:30
UNKNOWN How're you doing?

DAVID KAMPMAN Laura Linnell is a full time caregiver for her mother Ruth as well as for her fourteen month old daughter Josepha. Laura and her husband Dan are expecting their second child.

Full-time caregiver for her mother, Ruth 

00:03:50
LAURA LINNELL My mother I real… with her how I realize that she was getting umm… some deterioration, mentally was the check book was filling and bills are being returned because she, notices were coming that she hadn't paid bills and she always handled that. So when that first started happening I was almost like just panicked like, you know, she's gonna, there's something, something wrong wit her mentally and then you just kind of deny it, like sort of picked up the pieces and did what I had to do to alleviate that type of situation.

00:04:30
Altering Roles Between parent and Adult Child 

00:04:35
DAVID KAMPMAN Finding that our parent can no longer care for him or herself feels like a reversal in role between the parent and the adult child. 

00:04:40
LAURA LINNELL To have to care, care for my mother instead of her caring for me was at first very disconcerting. But umm… she would introduce me as her mother, oh, my mother's coming, here comes my mother, oh, I see my mother meaning me, and that would be, it would be hard to take at first, hard to accept to, would just send a sense of umm… almost repulsion to me. Because, you know, you are my mother, if I'm your mother, who's my mother, where's my mother. 

00:05:15
BETH WITROGEN MCLEOD A lot of people have trouble with what's called role reversal, I actually don't think that you parent your parent you love your parent. I was not ever my parents' parent but I was their friend and their confidant, certainly their daughter, certainly their baby girl. We maintained all of those roles at the same time and even though it was very shocking and difficult to bathe my father, and to help him change his colostomy bag. We actually made jokes about it and my mother was always extremely grateful, that I would bathe her and of course it was difficult to see her, her body so atrophied and was difficult to button up her pajamas and tuck her into bed. But we just did it and we did it in a loving way and she always said thank you for everything. And in doing that I received, received a lot from them that I never received when I was parented by them. It was a different kind of receiving and a culmination of love that, I, I live by to this day. 

00:06:20
Relating to your Parent in a Way You Didn't Before 

00:06:20
DAVID KAMPMAN Becoming the caregiver for a aging parent allows us to relate to our parent in a way we didn't before. 

00:06:30
BETH WITROGEN MCLEOD We're not just an adult child anymore but we are in relationship soul to soul. When you get down to this level, when you're dealing with death and dying, if you don't get down to the certain of level then you will have a lot of burnout and, and anger and resentment. 

00:06:45
TREVA WHICHARD I mean this, this whole, I'll start to cry but this whole journey with my mother has been very healing for both of us, I hated her, I just hated her. Hated her she was, I hated the fact that she wasn't the kind of mother that I thought I gotta have. And I never felt like I had gotten from her when I should have, she was never somebody who said, "Oh, I love you or I'm proud of you," and I always want hear her say that. 

00:07:20
BETH WITROGEN MCLEOD A lot of what has to happen, if you're going to do this and you're going to live through it well, is to undertake some kind of practice of forgiveness. It doesn't mean condoning, it doesn't mean judging, it means finding a place in your heart where you can live with the past whether that's real or, or perceived what happened to you. And either do the work yourself that you're asked to do or hire someone to do it for you. You don't have to do everything, no one even in good relationship has to do everything, but you have to get to a place where you can be in a relationship. And, and the care that needs to be given, can be given, and you can work with it now or work with it later, or you can stay on denial and still take care of your parents. But it's your choice, you always have a choice. 

00:08:10
TREVA WHICHARD She can't do anything to earn my love and approval, she can't, she isn't capable anymore. She just is and uh… I love my mother, I care about her now, I didn't before. And my… I said even though I get angry sometimes that I have to spend some time taking care of her affairs or her going out and all sorts of weather like today to go visit her. I care about her, and I want her to know that she is cared about. I can't even hate the Alzheimer's disease anymore, because it's been a gift, you hear people say about Alzheimer's, it is the worst thing that could happen to anybody but that's not true. It isn't the worst thing, the worst thing that could have happened to my mother and me is if we had never been reconciled, if we have never become two people who could be open and honest with other. That would have been the worst thing. 

00:09:10
DAVID KAMPMAN Caregiving is a spiritual practice, it is connecting to our experience as a caregiver and a heartfelt level. 

00:09:20
BETH WITROGEN MCLEOD Caregiving is a spiritual practice because it's about relationship and spirit is about relationship, it's not being in isolation, which is what fear does to you, it isolates you. In that so much of what caregiving is and why it feels so hellacious is that we live in fear with it. It's the love and the communion and the being with other people, the connecting at a really heartfelt level that makes it a spiritual practice. Can I possibly change the diaper on my father, can I possibly do this with my mother, and a lot of people think they can't do that but when you get into that place of being present, there is enough, we are enough and that's what makes it a spiritual journey and practice. 

00:10:00
DAVID KAMPMAN When we be become the caregiver for our aging parent we are forced to strip away the old ways of relating to our parent and venture into a new relationship. 

00:10:10

00:10:15
Experiencing Life Changes Through Caregiving 

00:10:20
DAVID KAMPMAN There are myriad changes that occur in a person's life when caring for an aging parent, changes that affect time, family life, and time for oneself. 

00:10:30
LAURA LINNELL But sometimes, I just feel frustrated that I can't just make a plan and do it, that, that can be, umm… very frustrating. You want to just be able to do what you need to do and you can't, you really can't. You have to have a schedule at all times, she has to be covered and taken care of and someone has to be watching her and so to be able to solicit that kind of help all the time is it's almost impossible. So you end up not doing maybe what you wanted to do. 

00:11:05
BETH WITROGEN MCLEOD The more we try to control how things are, the more stressed out we're going to be, there are only certain things we can really control in caregiving and those are usually, and not always, the, the medical and legal, the, the paperwork kinds of things. So many caregivers that I've talked to wish that they could cure their loved one, and they're so stressed out because they don't have control over that. We have to let go of wanting to control everything, that's a life lesson. 

00:11:35
TREVA WHICHARD You want to go out to the dining area and play cards. 

00:11:35
MILDRED All right. 

00:11:40
TREVA WHICHARD It's affected me most as far as time and responsibility, it's a lot of responsibility to take care of another human being and try to manage their money so that they are being cared for, you know, high quality way, but also uh… without being, without losing everything that she has financially. And uh… so it, it takes away some of my free time, I try to go to see her on the weekend because I work during the week. And, you know, on the weekends what I, what I'd like to have to myself, so that means, I have lust to myself, that I'd like to have. And that's, that's been, how it's affected me the most. 

00:12:20
BETH WITROGEN MCLEOD We tend as adults to get comfortable and to seek comfort and a lot of times we think that's what spirituality is, is to be comfortable, but the fact is if we don't change, if we don't keep moving that's death. We are so resistant to change because we have invested so much in the way things are, in the material forms of the way things are, that when change comes and caregiving is profoundly change, change agent. This is where our troubles come from is that resistance and I'm not saying it's easy to not resist, it's paying attention to the resistance being mindful of where we're resisting, where we're holding on to the way we want things to be rather than flowing of life. 

00:13:10
DAVID KAMPMAN Care Giving has a lot of turning points, the point at which we actually turn and embrace our caregiving experience is when we understand we cannot return to the life we lived before caring for our aging parent. 

00:13:20
BETH WITROGEN MCLEOD Turning points come when we realize that we need to keep moving forward and that life is about moving forward. Life and living fully is about continuing to move forward, one step at a time, staying in present time as much as you can. but those are the turning points when you're willing to move forward and you're willing to do what it takes because you know that's where life is. There is no other choice but it takes willingness to go through each of those points at which you realize that you can let go of the way it was, in the way you hoped it would be and keep moving into what it can be, because it can be so much more glorious than you even knew. 

00:14:05
Confronting Your Parent About Their Need for Help 

00:14:10
MILDRED Uh… you now, I am disappointed that I have to be away from home, (inaudible) to be here. 

00:14:15
TREVA WHICHARD Oh, I know you are, I know they are wonderful people and I know you're home, but if you can't be at home this is a good place to be. 

00:14:20
UNKNOWN Well, I could be at home, but they took me alone. 

00:14:25
TREVA WHICHARD Then the next hard thing was moving her into the assisted living, that was something she really didn't want to do. And uh… so I would just take her over to harbor point the place where she now lives. I would take her over and visit, we'd spend an hour or two there and then we'd spend a little longer in there and then one time we spent the whole day there. And umm… then we moved her in, but it was, it was very painful for her, it was very painful for me, I felt like I was manipulating her, I felt like I was cheating her out of life. And yet the reality was she was getting into life, she wasn't safe before. She was getting lost if she went for a walk. She was forgetting to eat. And she just couldn't live by herself anymore and it was sad, it was just very hard. 

00:15:25
DAVID KAMPMAN It is hard for an adult child to confront a parent about the parent's need for help, often including a third party helps to alleviate stress between parent and the adult child. 

00:15:35
AVRENE BRANDT One of the rules of thumb that I recommend is to try and involve a third person, practically speaking, you have to cope with the situation. But it's very intense sometimes between a parent and a child and so for example, if you're worried that your parent doesn't, isn't driving safely you might when the parent is going to visit the doctor the next time ask the doctor to intervene. And usually it's a good idea to call the physician before hand because they're very busy and, and say to them, "Look, I'm going to bring this up, I want you to evaluate my mother's vision or her reaction time, and maybe you can make some suggestions, maybe you can suggest that she take a driver's test again." And, and in that way it kind of softens things, so it's not so intense between you, you and your parent. 

00:16:25
DAVID KAMPMAN Confronting a parent about their need for help is a painful experience. It confronts caregivers with the reality of their parent's mortality. 

00:16:35
BETH WITROGEN MCLEOD I knew that by facing my parents' death and facing mortality, that I was being shown something that was very much more real than the things that I had chased after in the first half of my life. So it was very much a rite of passage into something very mysterious, but also very real, how to embody the truth of what relationship and what love really is. 

00:17:00
[sil.] 

00:17:05
Grieving as a Caregiver 

00:17:05
DAVID KAMPMAN Our parent has changed and our life has changed. This course is grief to occur daily in our lives as caregivers. The Alzheimer's disease in Laura's mother has progressed to the extent that Ruth is no longer capable of connecting with Laura. 

00:17:25
LAURA LINNELL There's a lot of grief, there's a lot of grief when you're do something like this because your loved one is right there but they are long gone, long gone. They don't really know who you are, they're not connected to you emotionally or what's going on in your life, and it's heartbreaking, it's heartbreaking because you know, how they used to be and how close you are and how much you still want to share. Especially, when I had the baby of all times, that I want my mother to, to be able to share that with me. Did I want to be able to share that with her, that I had my first baby, and I always expected that I would be able to share that with her. And then, she doesn't, she doesn't know that's her grandchild or that's my first child. So it's, it's, it's perpetual grieving, it's, it goes on and on and on. It's, it's heartbreaking. 

00:18:25
AVRENE BRANDT And the complicating factor for caregivers, when they grieve is there's no end point where, where they finally have their losses and then they can move on. Caregiver grieve can go on and on for years and it's also complicated, because in addition to grieving they can be angry, they can resent that person, that they're taking care of and that becomes what we call complicated grieving. And sometimes, just caregivers feel that, that their experience was just a negative experience and that's how they get out of that. Grief is a price, we must be prepared to pay if we care and if we connect, okay. On some level, when you care for something with somebody you understand that you may lose but you take a chance anyway. 

00:19:15
DAVID KAMPMAN There are ways to ease the grief that caregivers experience when caring for an aging parent ways to help them cope with their situation. 

00:19:30
Reassess Your Expectations 

00:19:30
AVRENE BRANDT The first suggestion I have is reassess, what did you expect when you became a caregiver and what is the reality. Because the bigger the discrepancy between what you thought it would be like and what it is like the more you're going to be frustrated and Burnout. The second tip I have is to gather information, okay. Find out as much as you can about the illness that you're dealing with because that will help you be prepared. And very, very strongly I recommend joining a support group. Another recommendation I have is to accept your limitations. Caregivers have an idea that they have to do it all. I often draw the parallel between caregiving and a relay race. In a relay race, there's one key player, a runner, okay. And, and he's the one that when, you know, when the, the seconds are lapsing they hand the baton to him, okay. But he doesn't run the whole race by himself, the baton is handed from person to person. So it's like that in care giving, you may be the key person, but you cannot run the hallways by yourself. The other recommendation I have is when I always make is plan in a very concrete way, or whatever problems you're going to encounter. Nothing changes magically and nothing changes without a plan. If you say well, I'm, I'm lonely, you know, I never get to see my friends, okay. And that's getting me down, okay so you could say well, how can I do that, who do I want to see, okay. What time could I do this? What, what can I be comfortable with in terms of leaving my loved one alone. And lastly the recommendation I have is that caregivers have to continue having a life beyond caregiving, both for their health, their physical health, their emotional health, their spiritual health. They have to keep doing things that kind of renew them. 

00:21:25
BETH WITROGEN MCLEOD Grief is transformational because it, it makes life bigger than it was, it forces us to let go of holding on and stopping life as of, of actually crimping of life process. If we hold on to everything the way it is we're always going to be miserable because nothing is the way it is. That last moment is already gone, and if we don't learn to acknowledge that life is impermanent, and grieve our losses, and let go, and let go, and let go, and we will succumb actually to burn out into depression. 

00:22:00

00:22:05
Recognizing and Dealing with the Stress of Caregiving 

00:22:05
DAVID KAMPMAN Family caregiving is one of the most stressful endeavors we may ever engage in. Demands are put on caregivers from all sides, time, energy, family, causing caregivers to suffer emotional distress such as guilt, anger, and depression. If unaddressed these feelings of distress can create physical and emotional problems in a caregiver's life. 

00:22:30
AVRENE BRANDT In the course of being a caregiver you will come across many emotions that you never even thought of, because when thought or think of being a caregiver, you start thinking first of the practical issues. How are you going to take care of the person, or you going to get some help from things like that. But caregivers are never prepared for the emotions and being a caregiver sets you up for a myriad of emotions, for guilt, for anger, for depression, for jealousy, for isolation. And caregivers when they're confronted with these things they feel that this is that they're angry, it's terrible, that they're guilty. It's, it's, you know, it's, it's burdensome and they don't understand that all these emotions are normal for, for caregivers and they just happen. It's nothing you, you call forth, they just happen they are part of caregiving. 

00:23:25
Guilt 

00:23:25
LAURA LINNELL I feel guilty all the time because I really feel that I'm working no matter how hard I try, I'm still going to wind up needing to place her in a nursing home no matter how much effort I give her care, it's still going to be too much for me. Especially, because I'm going to be having another baby in three months and even though I have so much on my plate in terms of my own little family, I still feel like, I still owe her. 

00:23:55
AVRENE BRANDT Being a caregiver is a prime situation for guilt. Caregivers feel that they're not doing enough, caregivers get guilty when they get angry with their loved one, they feel that's a, that's a bad thing to do, caregivers get guilty when they want to run away, they feel guilty when they want their loved one to disappear, okay. And the first thing that they have to understand is because you have a feeling or a wish doesn't mean you're going to follow through on it. Because you want to run away doesn't mean you're going to run away, caregivers don't run away. And your loved one because you want them to disappear then are not going to vanish. 

00:24:35
Anger 

00:24:40
DAVID KAMPMAN Anger is a normal emotion, whether it be anger at not having enough hours in the day or anger at a parent who is uncooperative and physically hard to handle. 

00:24:50
AVRENE BRANDT The key here is how do the handle the anger, so that it you don't have an outburst on your loved one and also you don't put yourself at risk so you don't stuff your anger and then get a headache or backache or stomachache or drink too much or loose sleep. And the key again is how do you handle this problem situation and for most caregivers they can identify certain situations that make them angry. Their loved one repeats themselves all the time, their loved one doesn't cooperate when they try to dress them, bathe them, people are not coming to help or whatever. So you identify as a caregiver those things that really set you off. 

00:25:35
DAVID KAMPMAN When you find yourself angry at a situation in your caregiving experience sit down and make concrete plan, and ask yourself the following questions: What can I do to alleviate the situation? How am I going to do that? When am I going to do it? Should I get someone to help? Whom should I get to help? Do I feel comfortable with this plan? 

00:26:05
Depression 

00:26:10
DAVID KAMPMAN When our lives as caregivers are full of change and loss, when we are ventured far from where we feel comfortable, we may fall into depression. 

00:26:20
AVRENE BRANDT The concern is, when you get what's called clinically depressed. If you are diagnosed with clinical depression, that is a time that you have to seek some professional help. And the, the signs of clinical depression are that you feel depressed for a period of two weeks or, or more and you experience five out of the following nine symptoms for those two weeks. 

00:26:50
DAVID KAMPMAN Number one, is a depressed mood, number two, is a change in appetite, so you either eat more or you eat less and your weight changes as a result. Number three, is change in sleep pattern that causes the caregiver to either sleep more or sleep less. Symptom number four, is feelings of worthlessness or of guilt. Number five, is low energy. Number six, is psychomotor retardation, making you have trouble getting started, it feels as if you are pulling yourself both mentally and physically through the day, or you may be agitated so you feel nervous. Number seven, is thoughts of suicide. Number eight, is lack of interest in things that you previously like to do. Number nine, is problems concentrating and in making decisions. If you have five of the nine symptoms for a period of two weeks, this is a sign that you need to seek professional help. 

00:27:55
Hitting Bottom 

00:28:05
DAVID KAMPMAN There comes a point in the caregiving journey where we have been stretched to the maximum, we have hit bottom, the farthest extent of who we thought ourselves to be. 

00:28:15
LAURA LINNELL I have felt fed up caring for my mother umm… at times when it's, it's more episodic than in general. It's, it's more alike when I'm trying to get out of the house early in the morning and she's moving especially slow and I have to get her done first, before I can go do what I need to do. And then, you know, I get her all cleaned up and she gets soiled and I have to start over, things like that can just make you fed up with that and want to not have to do it anymore. 

00:28:50
AVRENE BRANDT When we talk about caregivers get into the end of the world, we're talking about a situation in which the caregiver has committed themselves to get overwhelmed, either physically or emotionally or time wise, and then their body tells them, or their feelings tell them that they're doing more than their cable of, capable of. Unfortunately what happens, caregivers don't listen and they keep pushing and pushing. So how do you deal with this, the first thing is you have to listen to the message, to your body, to your emotions, that says something that you're doing or some things are putting you over the limit. And I always recommend then problem solving, you have to problem solve in a very concrete way. So you have to take the time to sit down and figure out what is it that's stressing you to the point that you feel, you can't go on. 

00:29:45
BETH WITROGEN MCLEOD You need to take respite breaks, respite means a break, it can be five minutes, it can be a mental break, it can be an hour out, it can be a week, it can be whatever it needs to be. But caregivers burnout because they have not taken care of themselves. And I can't emphasize enough how important it is to value yourself enough that you take care of yourself, it's the same principle was on an airplane, you put your oxygen mask on first before you care for someone else. 

00:30:15
Growing as a Caregiver 

00:30:25
DAVID KAMPMAN Caring for an aging parent is an experience that affects every aspect of our lives, it can be a positive experience depending on the attitude and perspective we bring to it. There are many opportunities for growth and relationship with others and growth within ourselves if we choose to embrace our life as a care giver. 

00:30:45
BETH WITROGEN MCLEOD I actually used to be a very negative person, I got very negative during caregiving because I felt that nothing was going right and I had no control, I couldn't do things well enough. But I learned that by being in present time and loving my parents the best I could, I actually became very positive, the more I let go. And the more I allowed life to be as it was presenting itself to me, the stronger I got, the more faith I had and I was able to become very positive. 

00:31:15
LAURA LINNELL Uh… I think I've grown in that, uh… I've definitely become more patient, I have much more understanding for what the elderly go through. Umm… you know behind someone's slow and elderly in a line, I don't get impatient any more, I realize how much they must be or, or might be struggling just to pull that five dollars out and pay for that one little thing. and be on their way. 

00:31:40
TREVA WHICHARD And I'm more the person that I need to be to other people because of how I have to be with my mother again. Her disease forces me to, it forces me to be merciful. And that spills over into other areas of my life. It could be the most positive part of your life as a child and caregiver and the most positive part parent's life in their later years. 

00:32:10
BETH WITROGEN MCLEOD What caregiving shows us is that we have a lot more courage and lot more strength than we ever imagined possible, because it draws on resources that usually are challenged in a very materialistic culture. So what caregivers find is that they can solve problems, they can hassle with medical insurance, they can, can do the legal issues and, and yes it's inconvenient at times, and there are a lot of problems, and frustrations, and finances, and how do you put a care plan together. It's very difficult at times especially if you're in a rural area, but we are much stronger than we believe and a lot of caregivers find that one of the greatest rewards is that they're not afraid of life anymore. They're not so afraid to live fully, because they know they have something within that society may not validate but that other caregivers witness and validate for them, yes, we can do this work.

DAVID KAMPMAN Caring for an aging parent offers the potential to discover more about ourselves than we ever knew. The choice is ours each moment, whether to give or take, act or pull back.
