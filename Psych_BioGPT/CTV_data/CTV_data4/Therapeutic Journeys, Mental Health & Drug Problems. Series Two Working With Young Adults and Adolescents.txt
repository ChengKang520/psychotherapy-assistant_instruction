00:00:00
Interview One Working in a Mental Health Agency: Depression and Drug Use 

00:00:00
Getting Started 

00:00:25
UNKNOWN So Kathryn, I wonder if you've been to a place like this before? 

00:00:30
KATHRYN No. Not really. I mean I spoke to my school counselor. But that's about it. 

00:00:35
UNKNOWN Okay. You haven't actually been to an outside agency like this before? 

00:00:40
KATHRYN No. 

00:00:40
UNKNOWN So you're probably feeling a bit, kind of odd about being here, yeah? Uhm, so I'm glad you're here because I guess your being here, uhm, means that there is something going on in your life that your counselor thought that it would be a good idea to talk to someone, and some part of you at least has agreed with that. Otherwise you wouldn't be sitting here. 

00:01:00
KATHRYN Mmm hmm. 

00:01:00
UNKNOWN So where would you like to start, but just before you start, maybe it would be a good idea for me to reassure you about what uhm, happens with what you tell me. 

00:01:15
KATHRYN Okay. 

00:01:15
UNKNOWN Because I think it's probably going to be important for you to know that what happens is confidential between us, unless I thought that you were seriously at risk in some way. And then we might have to rope somebody else in, but we would talk about that. 

00:01:25
KATHRYN Okay. 

00:01:25
UNKNOWN Okay? 

00:01:30
KATHRYN Yeah. 

00:01:30
UNKNOWN But I want you to feel you can be pretty open with me if, if you feel you can trust me, and you'll size me up as we go along. Okay? All right. So what's been happening? 

00:01:40
KATHRYN Uhm, well I guess the biggest thing is, it's like, like at school it's just become really, really hard. 

00:01:50
UNKNOWN Mmm hmm. 

00:01:50
KATHRYN But everything was-, I just, you know, I made grades really easily all through high school and now I've gotten to year 11 and it's just sort of just stopped. 

00:02:05
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:02:05
KATHRYN You know, I just- 

00:02:10
UNKNOWN It's been quite a sudden change, a big shift. 

00:02:10
KATHRYN It's just nothing's happening, you know? 

00:02:15
UNKNOWN It's kind of ground to a halt. 

00:02:15
KATHRYN Yeah. 

00:02:20
UNKNOWN Now have you got plans to go on to year 12? 

00:02:20
KATHRYN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:02:25
UNKNOWN So it's like, that's been the plan all along and you Don't really want that plan interfered with. And it sounds like it's good that you're in year 11 because if we can help you get to the bottom of what's wrong, and you can get back on track, there's no reason why you shouldn't pick up and, and go back to where you were in terms of cruising along. Hmm? 

00:02:45
KATHRYN That's what I'm hoping. 

00:02:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah, well I would hope so too. What else can you tell me about what's happened? You know, is there any particular incident or time when things started to go a bit wobbly? 

00:03:00
KATHRYN I don't know. Like, I suppose I've, I started experimenting and stuff like that a bit more, like all of, all of my friends and I have, just you know, doing just bits and pieces and-, 

00:03:20
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:03:20
KATHRYN And I guess well, last year my parents broke up, but I think, I don't know. I'm fine with that, you know? They seem to have it all sorted out. 

00:03:40
UNKNOWN Right. So you're fine with that. It's a big thing to happen, to have your folks split up, you know, and you know, when you say they seem to have it sorted it sounds like it hasn't been you know, a really nasty kind of break up. 

00:03:50
KATHRYN Yeah. I mean a lot of people turn around and they say that you know, woe is me about my, my parents are breaking up. Feel sorry for me. Where I'm not like that, you know? It's just it's, it's okay. 

00:04:05
UNKNOWN Right. So you don't want people to, to kind of take pity on you or make a fuss about it? 

00:04:10
KATHRYN It's not my problem. It's theirs. 

00:04:10
UNKNOWN Yeah. You're right, it is their problem. But I, I wouldn't, I wouldn't uhm, underestimate how it could've affected you as well, because you know, it's pretty- your family is pretty important to you and when it does split, you know, it takes some adjusting. 

00:04:30
[music] 

00:04:30
Exploring the Drug Use 

00:04:35
UNKNOWN You also said that you'd, you know, you and your friends had kind of been lately doing some things, that you know, are different? You used the word experimenting. I mean this is a time of your life when it's fairly common for kids to be kind of, uhm, loosening the ties on their primary school life and being a young kid and kind of straddling adulthood, you know? So that's, that's a pretty normal kind of pattern to be happening. Are you okay about telling me some of the things that you've been doing that you'd put in the category of experimenting? 

00:05:15
KATHRYN Are you going to-, I mean, will it, will it get to my mom? 

00:05:20
UNKNOWN As I said to you, what, you know, what we talk about, unless I felt you were seriously at risk, you know, it wouldn't go outside this room. 

00:05:25
KATHRYN Okay. 

00:05:25
UNKNOWN But it might be that there are things that it would be a relief for your mom to know, and perhaps your dad too. I don't know what your relationship's like with your dad. Uh, and your mom could be helped to understand what's going on with you as well. So it might be that things being out in the open would be a good thing. But we don't have to decide that now. 

00:05:45
KATHRYN Okay. 

00:05:45
UNKNOWN Yeah? 

00:05:45
KATHRYN Yeah. Uhm, well, just in away camps and stuff we've been, well it started off with just, you know, just drinking and smoking, just smoking pot and stuff. Uhm, but lately it's been just every other week here we've been just dropping ecstasy and stuff, just having some pills and-, 

00:06:15
UNKNOWN Okay, so it's been a bit of a smorgasbord, hey? 

00:06:15
KATHRYN Well, yeah. Yeah. Quite that. 

00:06:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. Well, I'm interested that you used the word experiment, because it, you know I guess that these things can start off as an experiment and then sometimes to get a little bit of a grip on you that you get surprised about, that you didn't think would happen. Is that, is that kind of ring true for you? Does it feel like it's still in the experimenting, or-, 

00:06:40
KATHRYN I guess not. It's just fun, you know? So I just-, 

00:06:45
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:06:50
KATHRYN Like to do it, you feel good. Everyone's having a good Time. 

00:06:55
UNKNOWN Sure. 

00:06:55
KATHRYN You don't have to think about anything else. 

00:06:55
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:07:00
KATHRYN It's just, live for the moment. 

00:07:00
UNKNOWN Right. And yet, there's something going on that you, I'm, I'm wondering whether you see a relationship between some of this sort of stuff that's been happening that's been really good fun, and the fact that your focus on your school work and you cruising along and managing things without a lot of hassles you know, do you see the two kind of being related or is that me jumping to conclusions? 

00:07:30
KATHRYN I guess. I guess doing this kind of stuff is, is good because I get away from it all, you know, to think about it? 

00:07:40
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:07:45
KATHRYN Yeah, you just go into this different world where everyone is happy. You don't have to think about anything else. It's just about laughing. 

00:07:50
UNKNOWN But you sound like you're kind of worried about the fact that you've, you've slipped behind in your schoolwork or your, your grades are being affected, or you know, that that's actually worrying you? 

00:08:05
KATHRYN Yeah, I really wanted to go to Uni... 

00:08:05
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:08:10
KATHRYN And, and study, and you know, I've always made my mom really proud. 

00:08:15
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:08:15
KATHRYN You know, I've always got a certificate or, I mean, I had really good grades, and I just can't do it. 

00:08:20
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:08:25
[music] 

00:08:25
Exploring Depression 

00:08:30
UNKNOWN So you've given me quite a lot of information and I appreciate you being frank with me. I'm kind of looking at you. You look unhappy. And I'd like to know a little bit more about what's been happening with you in yourself and the changes that you've seen in yourself lately. 

00:08:50
KATHRYN Uhm, I haven't been able to sleep for one. Your mind just doesn't switch off, you're just tossing and turning and- 

00:09:05
UNKNOWN Right. So it takes you ages to get to sleep? 

00:09:05
KATHRYN And... 

00:09:10
UNKNOWN And you, when you get to sleep, can you stay asleep or do you kind of, you wake up and then- 

00:09:10
KATHRYN It's the real sporadic just, your head doesn't rest and you have horrible dreams, just... 

00:09:20
UNKNOWN Okay, so you have a really unsettled night, and then you wake up feeling stuffed the next morning? 

00:09:25
KATHRYN Basically. 

00:09:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. What, what else has changed in yourself? 

00:09:35
KATHRYN I find, I don't, I didn't like the things that I used to like, you know what I mean? Like... 

00:09:45
UNKNOWN You're not getting the same enjoyment out of things? 

00:09:45
KATHRYN Yeah. So I really just think for me and my mom to go round the roof with the dog, and I couldn't be bothered quite frankly, you know? It just really, really befuddles me that I, I used to get such a kick out it, you know? It used to really clear my head. 

00:10:10
UNKNOWN So you feel like you haven't got the energy to do these things? You can't be bothered. You don't care. 

00:10:15
KATHRYN I don't want to. 

00:10:20
UNKNOWN Right. Okay. What's, what's happened to your appetite? Sometimes when people are feeling down they, they eat more or they eat less or they eat differently in some ways. Has there been any change that you've noticed there? 

00:10:40
KATHRYN To be completely honest, I don't think I've, I really haven't been eating much at all. 

00:10:40
UNKNOWN Right. You haven't felt hungry. 

00:10:45
KATHRYN Now that you mention it, a couple of people have said things. (crosstalk) 

00:10:50
UNKNOWN Would you say you've lost any weight in the last few months? 

00:10:55
KATHRYN Yeah, but not consciously, and you know, and people say that you lose weight and everything, you think that's great. 

00:11:05
UNKNOWN Right. Yeah. 

00:11:05
KATHRYN I just don't think about it but... 

00:11:05
UNKNOWN Right. Have you felt tearful? Do you, do you cry? Hmm, right. And do you do that alone? Or do you do that with, with friends or... 

00:11:20
KATHRYN Mmm mmm. 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN You don't do it with friends. 

00:11:25
KATHRYN I couldn't. 

00:11:25
UNKNOWN You hide it from people? 

00:11:25
KATHRYN Yeah, I don't want to bring it out on them, you know? It's, it's not their problem and you know, yeah. 

00:11:40
UNKNOWN It sounds to me like you're actually quite depressed. And that's a word that we often sort of throw around. It's part of the language is oh, you're feeling a bit depressed. And often people just may now feel a bit down, you know? In a bad mood. 

00:11:55
KATHRYN Yeah. 

00:11:55
UNKNOWN But yours sounds like it's been pretty unrelenting, you know? That there's not a lot of variation and you're feeling down most of the time in some way. And tired, can't be bothered about the things that you used to. That's adding up to me to sound a bit like you really are quite depressed. And that's not a good space to be, and it does make it difficult to crank yourself up and do what you need to do. Hmm? So I think we're going to need to look at that. And it's probably connected in some way to your drug use, but your drug use doesn't sound like it's rampant. Uhm, but we need to look at those links together. But mainly I think we need to get you feeling less depressed, and then I think a lot of your own natural resources and energy and interest in things will come back. You think that sounds like a good idea? 

00:12:45
KATHRYN Yeah. 

00:12:45
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:12:45
KATHRYN I don't want to be relying on drugs to escape, you know? 

00:12:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:12:50
KATHRYN And to feel better? 

00:12:55
[music] 

00:12:55
Exploring the Function of Drug Use: It's the only escape at the moment 

00:13:00
UNKNOWN You said something a few moments ago, Kathyrn that I thought was pretty wise. You said I don't want to be relying on drugs, hmm? Uhm, it sounds like you to think that you can handle things pretty much on your own. Hmm? What, when you say that you've been relying on the drugs a bit, what have they been doing for you? What, what does using these various bits and pieces do for you? What do you enjoy about it? What do you like about it? 

00:13:30
KATHRYN Well, when you're on E, you know, you just, you, you don't think about anything else. You're just with your friends. Everyone's smiling. Everyone's hugging. There's music around. You're definitely dancing. And ... 

00:13:50
UNKNOWN So anything that's on your mind that's troubling you gets taken care of. 

00:13:55
KATHRYN You think it-, all you think about is there and then. Just, you're in that moment and... 

00:13:55
UNKNOWN Right. In the here and now. 

00:14:00
KATHRYN It feels so good. 

00:14:00
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:14:05
KATHRYN And then, you just want to chill out a bit more, just smoke some weed and stuff. 

00:14:10
UNKNOWN And what does, what do you like about that? When you say chill out, what does it do? What does it do for your body or for your mind, you know? Sometimes it has different-, 

00:14:20
KATHRYN Your head kind of goes a bit foggy, but it just brings a smile to your face. 

00:14:25
UNKNOWN Right. So you get to feel kind of easy and less tense and things don't matter. 

00:14:35
KATHRYN Yeah. 

00:14:35
UNKNOWN The way they do when you're not... 

00:14:35
KATHRYN Yeah. It sort of just relaxes everything. 

00:14:40
UNKNOWN Right. Would you say that you're naturally a person who's quite tense and who gets affected by things quite deeply? 

00:14:55
KATHRYN I guess. Like, if you think here's something that happens to my friend, you know, I can feel it as well. That kind of thing. 

00:15:00
UNKNOWN Right. And I imagine that your folks splitting up last year, even though you say, you know, that's cool. They're managing it and it's no huge deal. You know, I think that that's probably been something that's, that's been part of this picture as well. Hmm? I imagine that you care about both of them and uhm, it's not an ideal situation to have your folks in different camps, hmm? So that might be something that we, we talk about. So there's clearly some things that, you know, smoking a bit of weed, uhm, having some ecstasy with your friends. It helps, hmm? What's happening with you. You look quite sad right now. Hmm? 

00:15:45
KATHRYN I don't like my parents being split up. 

00:15:50
UNKNOWN No. No. Yeah. It's a big thing isn't it? And I think you've been carrying this alone for a long time, and it's, you've been doing your best pedaling along. You know? They call it the duck syndrome. Your (inaudible )underneath. I think that's probably what, what's been happening, hey? Yeah. And you don't want to rely on the drugs to help you through this difficult time, hmm? 

00:16:20
KATHRYN It's, it's the only escape at the moment. 

00:16:20
UNKNOWN Right. Yes. Okay. So we, we probably need to do some work together if you're interested on how you can manage some of those feelings, those thoughts, those uncomfortable feelings, those lonely feelings, those whatever it is. 

00:16:45
KATHRYN Uh huh. 

00:16:45
UNKNOWN So that you can pick and choose whether you use some of the drugs that you do with your mates, hmm? Rather than feeling that you need to rely on them to help you through. 

00:16:55

Interview Two Working in an Alcohol and Drug Agency: Anxiety and Speed Use 

00:16:55
Presenting Problem: I'm starting to feel a bit out of control 

00:17:05
UNKNOWN Okay, Eileen, now that we've got the confidentiality bit out of the way, do you want to tell me what's brought you here today? 

00:17:10
EILEEN I've been having a few problems with my speed use. 

00:17:15
UNKNOWN Right. Okay. Uhm, do you want to tell me a little bit more about some of those problems? 

00:17:20
EILEEN Uhm, I've been getting in trouble quite a bit at work recently, and uhm, my need's becoming a problem, and I'm having fights with my boyfriend. And it's just starting to feel a bit out of control. 

00:17:30
UNKNOWN Right. So things have kind of escalated a bit. 

00:17:35
EILEEN Yeah. 

00:17:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. So you're sort of implying that these things have been fairly recent? Is that the case? 

00:17:40
EILEEN Yeah, probably the last sort of-, at work, the last five or six weeks, and yeah, things are just getting worse and worse at home. 

00:17:45
UNKNOWN Right. And how, if I can ask, just how long you've been using speed generally? 

00:17:50
EILEEN I've been using for a few years, but it was never really a problem. It was just sort of every now and then. And then I hooked up with my boyfriend about six months ago or so, and, and he used a lot more than me so... 

00:18:05
UNKNOWN Right. Okay. So it's good to know that in the past you've, you've been pretty much in charge of your speed use, is that right? 

00:18:10
EILEEN Yeah. Yeah. 

00:18:10
UNKNOWN Okay, but circumstances have changed and you're with a guy who's using a bit more, and your use has crept up. 

00:18:20
EILEEN Yeah. 

00:18:20
UNKNOWN And now you're, you're getting some problems associated with that? 

00:18:20
EILEEN Yeah. 

00:18:20
UNKNOWN Yeah. Tell me a little bit more about the, the specific sort of problems that you're feeling at work. We'll look at work first, because you mentioned that first. 

00:18:30
EILEEN Okay, uhm, I work in a restaurant, and uhm, it's obviously really busy. It's a really busy restaurant, so you're really busy all the time. And I'm finding it really stressful. Like I've always found it pretty stressful. 

00:18:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:18:40
EILEEN But now, I almost feel I can't cope sometimes, and I'm forgetting things that I should be doing. I forget to put in some of the orders sometimes or I can't concentrate, and the chefs yell at me and I just don't know what to do anymore. And I get really snappy at customers. 

00:19:00
UNKNOWN And that's kind of not like you've normally managed your work. 

00:19:00
EILEEN No. 

00:19:05
UNKNOWN Right. Okay, so that's a bit distressing, isn't it? 

00:19:05
EILEEN Yeah. 

00:19:05
UNKNOWN What about outside work. Have you noticed any changes. I mean you said there's been a few problems with your boyfriend and... 

00:19:15
EILEEN Yeah, we're just, we're fighting a lot more, and uhm, I'm just getting a lot more worried about our relationship and, and where we're going. And I get quite worried because he deals sometimes, so he's quite busy. So when he goes at night, out at night, I get quite worried what he's doing, even though I know, I just get quite worried about it. 

00:19:30
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:19:35
[music] 

00:19:35
Exploring the Anxiety: I'm on edge all the time 

00:19:40
UNKNOWN So you look quite edgy now, as you tell me about that, you know, as you kind of picture these things happening, you feel quite edgy. 

00:19:45
EILEEN Yeah. Well, I'm on edge all the time. 

00:19:50
UNKNOWN Right, okay. Uhm, most of us can put ourselves along a kind of spectrum where at this end, you know, we feel we're sort of generally wired to be more of the kind of anxious type. Or at this end, where we're generally wired to be more of the kind of flat type. Where would you generally put yourself on that line, you know, speed use aside? 

00:20:10
EILEEN Well, I've probably always been pretty anxious. Like I've, I've always gotten stressed and, and, and had problems with sleeping and, and stuff like that. But now that I'm using more it's definitely gotten worse. 

00:20:20
UNKNOWN Right. But then the trap must be conveyed that it can kind of initially deal with that, can't it? 

00:20:25
EILEEN Yeah. 

00:20:25
UNKNOWN So it's a bit seductive, isn't it? In that way? 

00:20:30
EILEEN Yeah, well at first it made me feel a lot more in control and a lot more confident. So it was great. But, yeah. 

00:20:35
UNKNOWN Okay. So tell me a little bit more about the kind of symptoms, the kind of uhm, feelings that you have that you would put down to being anxious. 

00:20:45
EILEEN I feel like I have this knot inside all of the time, and sometimes it's worse, but it's there all of the time, and I feel like I'm on edge. And sometimes I get quite short in my breath. 

00:20:55
UNKNOWN Okay. 

00:20:55
EILEEN And uh, sometimes I just can't concentrate and I quite often just can't sleep. And I know speed makes you not sleep, but it's .... 

00:21:05
UNKNOWN It feels like it's more complex than that? 

00:21:05
EILEEN Yeah. 

00:21:10
UNKNOWN Are there any other physical symptoms that you get? Uhm, you said you, you know, you get a bit short of breath, you feel like you've got a knot in your tummy. 

00:21:15
EILEEN Well, a couple of times, only a couple of times, but a couple of times I've had, like panic attacks, sort of. 

00:21:20
UNKNOWN Right, that's pretty scary isn't it? 

00:21:20
EILEEN Really scary. Like I thought I was going to die. 

00:21:25
UNKNOWN Yeah. That's, that's, people often feel like that. In fact, You won't die, but it feels like you're going to die. And it's usually associated with, you know, feeling like your heart beats (crosstalk) 

00:21:35
EILEEN It feels like it's going to pump out of my chest. 

00:21:35
UNKNOWN Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes people get ... 

00:21:40
EILEEN I get clammy. Like, I'm clammy all the time. 

00:21:40
UNKNOWN Right. Yeah. And you said you, at work, you lose concentration? You know, that you forget things? 

00:21:45
EILEEN Yeah. 

00:21:50
UNKNOWN That, that's another sign of really having quite a problem with anxiety. 

00:21:55
[music] 

00:21:55
Exploring the Connection 

00:22:00
UNKNOWN So I'm, I'm kind of wondering if we've got two things sitting alongside each other here, you know? Your speed, your speed use has crept up, and no doubt that's got something to do with the, the sort of escalation of symptoms that you've had. But I'm wondering if there's been a kind of wiring to be this way anyway, and that we might be looking at two different issues here. Does that sort of make sense? 

00:22:25
EILEEN Yeah. Yeah, well, yeah. I suppose I've always been pretty anxious, so yeah. 

00:22:30
UNKNOWN So if we look at both those problems, which, which one do you reckon we need to tackle first if we were to do some work together? 

00:22:40
EILEEN I'd love to able to kick using speed so... 

00:22:40
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:22:40
EILEEN I know that's causing me problems, but it's more this anxious stuff.

00:22:55
UNKNOWN Tell me a little bit more about what it is that you like about using speed. 

00:22:55
EILEEN Well, at first it made me feel less anxious and more confident and in control. 

00:23:00
UNKNOWN Yeah. It's, it's kind of a bit tricky that way, isn't it? 

00:23:05
EILEEN Yeah. 

00:23:05
UNKNOWN It kind of deals with the problem, but over time it seems to lose that effect doesn't it? 

00:23:10
EILEEN Yeah. 

00:23:10
UNKNOWN Yeah, and then you're kind of left back home where you were with the anxiety. 

00:23:15
EILEEN Yeah, and because my boyfriend uses too, like I, I just don't know how I'd go with not using. 

00:23:20
UNKNOWN Right. You said that you actually really enjoyed using speed, so it's going to be important to still look at what role speed has in your life before we look at how you might do with less. Does that make sense? 

00:23:30
EILEEN Yeah. 

00:23:30
UNKNOWN Yeah. So, so tell me about, your face lit up when you said, you know, you really liked using speed. Tell me more about that. 

00:23:35
EILEEN Uhm, it just it makes me feel really good, and normally it makes me feel really in control and confident and like I have energy. But it's controllable. 

00:23:50
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:23:50
EILEEN And, uhm, yeah, my boyfriend, it's something that we do together. It's, it's something that we have, in common. 

00:23:55
UNKNOWN Right. It's quite a, quite an intimate time when you use together, is that-? 

00:24:00
EILEEN Yeah, it's, I don't, it's not really intimate anymore, but it's a part of what we have together I suppose. 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN Right. Okay. Are there other people that you use with as well? (crosstalk) 

00:24:10
EILEEN Yeah, most of my friend use. 

00:24:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:24:10
EILEEN Uhm, they don't seem to have as many problems, but, yeah, they all use. 

00:24:15
UNKNOWN Okay. So in some ways, the prospect of being without it, uhm... 

00:24:20
EILEEN Yeah, no, I, I don't really want to give it up completely. 

00:24:25
UNKNOWN Right. Okay. So it's, there's something about uhm, I want to be in control of my use and get back to a stage where I felt I was managing things, you know? It was serving a purpose, socially, uhm, personally, uhm, in terms of your relationship. But recently, it's, it's had an effect on you or you feel like It's having an effect on you that's not so good. 

00:24:45
EILEEN Yeah. Yeah. And just because it feels all out of control, because I'm so anxious all the time. 

00:24:55
UNKNOWN Right. So, if you were to do something about it, you know, and use a bit less speed, what, what do you think would be good about that? 

00:25:05
EILEEN What would be good about using less speed? 

00:25:05
UNKNOWN Yeah. 

00:25:05
EILEEN Well, hopefully my anxiety would go down a bit. 

00:25:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:25:10
EILEEN Uhm, hopefully I wouldn't get in so much trouble at work. I might be able to cope at work a little bit better. And I might not get so paranoid about my boyfriend when he's out and about. Because I know that's what he does. I know that's what he has to do, but... 

00:25:25
UNKNOWN What, what, what happens for you when he goes out? What-? 

00:25:30
EILEEN I just, it sounds really stupid. Uhm, because I know he wouldn't do anything, but I just get this sense that he doesn't love me anymore and that he's going to go off with another girl and he's not really doing business. He's actually out playing with other people and that he'd just rather be without me. 

00:25:50
UNKNOWN Right. That's quite distressing to get into that kind of way of thinking. 

00:25:50
EILEEN Yeah, and then I start hassling him all the time. 

00:25:55
UNKNOWN Has that just been quite recent, or you know, were you initially kind of suspicious like that or-? 

00:26:00
EILEEN Uhm, I've probably, I mean I've always gotten a bit anxious when he's gone out, but I always knew that was just what he did, I mean, that's part of what he does. But it's definitely gotten a bit worse. 

00:26:10
UNKNOWN Right. 

00:26:15
[music] 

00:26:15
It's Your Decision 

00:26:20
UNKNOWN So we've, we've kind of established that, you know, you tend, you've probably always been a little bit wired towards the anxious end of the scale anyway. But things have kind of gotten bigger on that front, in the last while. 

00:26:30
EILEEN Yeah. 

00:26:30
UNKNOWN So, uhm, I'd, I'd like to think that we could do something about your anxiety. Uhm, there are some very simple strategies that uh, are quite powerful in terms of helping you managing your anxiety, quite apart from your speed use. And then maybe we can, if we do that first, and get you feeling like you're back in charge a bit of some of these things like the shakes, the clammy hands, the, the heartbeat, you know, so that you don't feel terrified by that. Because what happens with anxiety, people have the, the kind of symptoms and then they get terrified that the symptoms are going to come on, so it kind of feeds itself, if you like, yeah? 

00:27:10
EILEEN Yeah. 

00:27:10
UNKNOWN So, maybe if we worked on some of those kind of strategies first, just leaving your speed use alone completely for the moment, and get you feeling a bit more in charge of things, then you might feel like you want to actually peg back your speed use a bit and we can look at that. 

00:27:25
EILEEN So you think that I can feel better and still keep using? 

00:27:25
UNKNOWN I think it's possible for you to get better at managing your anxiety. And once that happens, it might be that it feels like the old way you use to feel before your, your speed use crept up a bit. And you might make the decision to cut back. But, you know, I don't think that we need to make that decision now. And it's going to be your decision to make. It's not up to me to make that one. 

00:27:45
EILEEN Okay. Yeah. 

00:27:50
UNKNOWN So it kind of worries you to think that there might be an agenda here that you've got to give up your speed use? 

00:27:55
EILEEN Well, yeah, I mean I suppose I thought I'd come in and you'd say I had to give it up and, I didn't really want to. 

00:27:55
UNKNOWN Right. Okay. Well, that's really important that you've told me that because it's certainly not uhm, the tack that I take. You know, this is your decision. I think it's great that you've come here today to do something about the fact that you've been feeling really edgy. Uhm, and I think we can do lots about that, and you can make the decision yourself about your speed use from there. 

00:28:15
EILEEN Okay. 

00:28:15
UNKNOWN Yeah? 

00:28:15
EILEEN Yeah, that sounds good.
