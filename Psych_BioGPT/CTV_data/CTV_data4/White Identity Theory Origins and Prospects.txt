WHITE IDENTITY THEORY: ORIGINS and PROSPECT Rita Hardiman and William E. Cross, Jr. 

00:00:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Good morning. 

00:00:10
RITA HARDIMAN Good morning. 

00:00:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I had fun with the kids last night. I think I finally made a hit with them. So. 

00:00:15
RITA HARDIMAN I think so, too. 

00:00:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I wonder if she'll realize that her candy is still hidden under the bed, okay. Uhm, and today, I, I found myself, in preparation for today, I found myself going back over your early work, ah, to refresh myself. And I really liked the way you summarized Mark Chesler's work who I believe is at University of Michigan. 

00:00:35
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:00:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And he makes some very powerful statements that you do a, a good job of summarizing. You say some other things as well, and that is the whole that, ah, it's amazing how in the social sciences which are overwhelmingly, person by White people, ah, that almost all of the literature on the race is focusing on people of color, ah, sometimes on women, but there almost is, ah, no, no theory until... (crosstalk) 

00:01:00
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:01:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...you, you came along others, ah, on White racism and theory of White identity development and so on. Could you comment on, on that? 

00:01:10
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah, ah, when I, uhm, began my, my graduate studies and I, ah, quickly got turned away from wanting to understand how to counsel... (crosstalk) 

00:01:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:01:20
RITA HARDIMAN ...and how to "save". (laugh) 

00:01:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:01:20
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, ah, Black kids, Hispanic kids that I was working with at the time in the Juvenile Justice System, I, ah, really got refocused through the work of our friend and colleague, Bailey Jackson... (crosstalk) 

00:01:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:01:35
RITA HARDIMAN ...on understanding, uhm, myself and understanding, the, the White experience and found through my studies and doing a lot of searching and, and research that there was actually very little in the Social Science or, or psychological literature about the experience of White people, the impacts of racism on Whites and how Whites are socialized in a racist society. 

00:02:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:02:00
RITA HARDIMAN So, uhm, it, it was, ah, frustrating for me to find that, ah, but it was enlightening as well. It, it confirmed what I think is a real bias in the, in the literature, in the field, and the whole profession, that we focused more on the victims of oppression. 

00:02:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:02:20
RITA HARDIMAN Ah, rather than on the perpetrators. And when the people who were conducting the research and who were framing the theories or framing the, the constructs, through which we will make sense of, of those phenomena, are themselves members of the dominant group. It, it, I think, is somewhat understandable that we don't focus on ourselves or focus inward. 

00:02:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Well, you know, that makes one curious about something and that is how did you break through? I mean, you're coming along and... (crosstalk) 

00:02:45
RITA HARDIMAN  Ahh. 

00:02:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...as you bring it most people are... (crosstalk) 

00:02:50
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. 

00:02:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...are going in one direction. 

00:02:50
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. 

00:02:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Was that a gutsy thing? Was it or, ah, ah, an, an accident or. 

00:02:55
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm. I, (crosstalk) 

00:02:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Did you find resistance when you wanted to study, ah. 

00:03:00
RITA HARDIMAN no, I, I didn't find resistance. But I don't think it was an accident. Ah, I'm, I'm glad you asked that... (crosstalk) 

00:03:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:03:05
RITA HARDIMAN ...because I think it's important to understand the context in which any person, ah, theorist... (crosstalk) 

00:03:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:03:10
RITA HARDIMAN ...comes to develop their model, uhm, the historical context, the social context. And for me, ah, it was, ah, I think a result of growing up in a particular period in history. I came of age in the '60s. I witnessed the Civil Rights Movement as a child... (crosstalk) 

00:03:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Uh hmm. 

00:03:30
RITA HARDIMAN ...on television and growing up, ah, and coming to college in the late '60s or early '70s. There was beginning to be a shift in understanding after the, ah, the Kerner Commission. 

00:03:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:03:40
RITA HARDIMAN In particular, that White society, ah, was responsible for racism. Uhm, and so that, uhm, was one thing that stuck in my mind. The other thing was, ah, as I said, I was very much influenced, ah, by Bailey Jackson. I was, ah, taking classes with him at the University of Massachusetts. And quite literally I, because I was working with, ah, delinquent kids, many of whom were Black Hispanic, (sigh) I, ah, wanted to take classes with him... (crosstalk) 

00:04:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:04:10
RITA HARDIMAN ...to "Understand the Black experience." 

00:04:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Correct. 

00:04:15
RITA HARDIMAN I thought that's what, was, I was supposed to do. 

00:04:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:04:15
RITA HARDIMAN  To, ah, to be an effective counselor or a service provider with these kids, and I'll never forget in one class, ah, that I was sitting in with him, ah, he asked, "Why did everyone come to this class? Why did you sign up for this class?" And I said, well, I needed to understand what makes these people tick. 

00:04:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Okay. 

00:04:40
RITA HARDIMAN Well, you can imagine the response... (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:04:40
RITA HARDIMAN ...that I got from Bailey. 

00:04:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, but. (crosstalk) 

00:04:40
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, and he replied that, ah, that he would advise that I try to understand first what it's like to be White. 

00:04:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Uh hmm. 

00:04:50
RITA HARDIMAN Well, I, I was dumbfounded. I, I was totally taken aback by that. And, but the question's stuck with me... (crosstalk) 

00:04:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:04:55
RITA HARDIMAN ...for, for a very long time. Uhm, and then at, at, obviously I went, went forward with it. The other factor, I think, that, that brought me to this place is, uhm, at the same time that I was going through some of this questioning, ah, in, in my graduate training, I was also becoming very influenced by the feminist movement. 

00:05:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:05:15
RITA HARDIMAN And an understanding of my own experience, ah, as a female in the society. And I knew, ah, on a gut level that many of the things that happened to me, growing up and, and as I matured, were not my fault. 

00:05:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Okay. 

00:05:35
RITA HARDIMAN They, that I, I had the, uhm, you know, I had the ability or, or had the analysis of, of sexism as a social phenomenon, ah, around me at the same time. 

00:05:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:05:45
RITA HARDIMAN So, I think it helped me, that helped me understand that, ah, they really are social systems, there is institutional power, there is oppression. Uhm, and I think I, I was able to make some of the translation of my experience being female to understanding, ah, the phenomenon of racism. 

00:06:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Uh hmm. 

00:06:10
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, In demo, (crosstalk) 

00:06:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And then in the thesis itself, ah, you do one of the best jobs, I think, even to date, that the thesis has been out for, I think, you did it in '84. (crosstalk) 

00:06:15
RITA HARDIMAN '82. 

00:06:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  '82. 

00:06:20
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:06:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, but your chapter, in which you move from, what you call generic models, and you used racial identity and, and, ah, socialization in general and, ah, gender identity and you show how in some ways, there is a similarity, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:06:30
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:06:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. across the number of these constructs in, in terms of how they unfold in the person's life. 

00:06:35
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:06:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Going from a point where, I guess, you put as, it's almost like, ah, before they can talk about it, it's happening to them. 

00:06:40
RITA HARDIMAN Yes. 

00:06:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And, ah, then you showed how that takes place across these experiences. And then you just unfold your own model. I just love that, I, because in a sense, ah, it seems to be that the model becomes more defensible. (crosstalk) 

00:06:55
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:06:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uhm, ah, it is less easily viewed as something that comes out of your head or as, as an armchair, you, ah, it's a very careful delineation. 

00:07:00
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:07:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I don't know that, if that's maybe where you wanna start is to tell the audience a bit about how you did try to unfold it before we go into the model itself. 

00:07:10
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. Okay. I, uhm, how I got to that was that, that when I did start, uhm, to do the research ar, around White identity... (crosstalk) 

00:07:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:07:20
RITA HARDIMAN ...and, uhm, and the impact of racism on, on White's consciousness, I, as I said, was, was really frustrated. I would go through... (crosstalk) 

00:07:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:07:30
RITA HARDIMAN ...searches, at, ah, computer searches and at the library, go everywhere and found very little written about, ah, how White people come to learn racist, racism. 

00:07:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:07:40
RITA HARDIMAN Racist messages and what, what happens when that gets internalized, and I had a sense it was internalized. 

00:07:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:07:50
RITA HARDIMAN I mean I, I could see it in myself. 

00:07:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:07:50
RITA HARDIMAN I was doing a lot of uncovering of, of, of things in my own life, ah, in my own belief system. Ah, and I really did not find a lot published... (crosstalk) 

00:08:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:08:00
RITA HARDIMAN ...on, on Whites. Uhm, and so I realized that in order to make sense of Whiteness or White racial identity which is one of many social identities. 

00:08:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:08:15
RITA HARDIMAN I knew that I was gonna have to look at other models that hid on other issues of social identity. 

00:08:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. Okay. 

00:08:20
RITA HARDIMAN Which led me to look at ethnic identity, ah, racial identity, uhm, your work, Bailey's work. 

00:08:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:08:30
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, and gender identity which I also thought of as a social, ah, as a social category. And I was able, through a review of, of all of what had been published up to the early '80s, to find that they were generic, ah, passages or stages that people would go through in grappling with the meaning of their social group membership. 

00:08:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:08:55
RITA HARDIMAN So whether you were a member of an ethnic group, a, a White ethnic group or Asian ethnic group, whether you are female or male, ah, and, and the racial identity literature, ah, around Black identity, they were stages that each of those models had in common. 

00:09:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:09:10
RITA HARDIMAN  Uhm, all of them talked, uhm, about just to some degree, the stage at which we enter the world when we're born and, uhm, where we're really naive in a social sense or naive about the social world. 

00:09:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:09:30
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:09:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It's what happening to us. We've been molded... (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
RITA HARDIMAN Right, right. (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...not in a strictly deterministic sense but. (crosstalk) 

00:09:35
RITA HARDIMAN No. 

00:09:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:09:35
RITA HARDIMAN  But, but things are coming, ah... (crosstalk) 

00:09:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:09:40
RITA HARDIMAN ...in, and we, we have to make sense of those as small children. So, ah, I found in those models a stage that, ah, where people talk about the process of socialization. 

00:09:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:09:50
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, children taking a lot of things in and making sense of the world around them and making meaning of their social group membership and the social group membership of others. So I may be a four-year-old White child, but, ah, I'm beginning to develop some sense of who I am as a White child. But I'm also developing a sense of who people who are Black, brown, ah, Asian, Indian. 

00:10:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So the fashion is almost an imprinting process that's taking place. 

00:10:20
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. 

00:10:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And the, the child, may not be as reflective as it might be in another print... (crosstalk) 

00:10:20
RITA HARDIMAN Right. And they can't, they can't name that. (crosstalk) 

00:10:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...what do you, what do you call that early, ah, you've, you've had it like cluster that experienced a, a title of it. 

00:10:30
RITA HARDIMAN I, I called it, uhm, ah, the naive stage. 

00:10:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:10:30
RITA HARDIMAN Ah, or I've also kind of a subtitle for it as, ah, no social consciousness. 

00:10:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Okay. 

00:10:40
RITA HARDIMAN So, uhm, and by social, I mean really the, the, the larger social word, world. There's a social consciousness of family... (crosstalk) 

00:10:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:10:45
RITA HARDIMAN ...immediate family. (crosstalk) 

00:10:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It's a, kind of, pre-social world, okay. 

00:10:50
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. 

00:10:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:10:50
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. I also found on, in all of the models, a stage that follows the, the, ah, naive one, ah, which, ah, and again to varying degrees... (crosstalk) 

00:11:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:11:00
RITA HARDIMAN ...that various authors talked about it, a stage of acceptance where, ah, the individual, ah, has to resolve, uhm, all of these messages that they're getting. Uhm, they're being told lots of things, conveyed messages, in, in many different ways through parents and media and school and church... (crosstalk) 

00:11:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:11:20
RITA HARDIMAN ...and, ah, ah, all of those things. They're being told things about themselves as a member of a group and about other people. Now, some of that, I may not believe... (crosstalk) 

00:11:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:11:35
RITA HARDIMAN ...immediately. 

00:11:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:11:35
RITA HARDIMAN But over years and years of, of really being bombarded, I think, through television in particular, uhm, ah, but lots of other sources with those messages, I begin to develop an acceptance of what, uhm, is the prevailing social definition of that group. 

00:11:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, that's, that's the way it is, kind of. (crosstalk) 

00:11:55
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:11:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:11:55
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:11:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, you know. 

00:11:55
RITA HARDIMAN Ah, this is the way the world is. This is a natural order of things. The reason why those people are like that is because that's how it is on the reason that you're like so that's how it is. 

00:12:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It's not so much to, to imply close mindedness as much as at this point... (crosstalk) 

00:12:10
RITA HARDIMAN No. 

00:12:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...the person that has moved to a point of, ah, I wouldn't say reflection, but, ah, it's, it just seems so natural to them... (crosstalk) 

00:12:15
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:12:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...that, ah, ah, not to be redundant, well that's what people will say, well, you know, what other way is there? Isn't, isn't that it? 

00:12:25
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:12:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, right. 

00:12:25
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:12:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And that becomes the reality for it all. (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
RITA HARDIMAN Yes. 

00:12:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So that's called the acceptance component. (crosstalk) 

00:12:25
RITA HARDIMAN Right, right. (crosstalk) 

00:12:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:12:30
RITA HARDIMAN Now, uhm, many people, uhm, I think, can stay in that stage for life. 

00:12:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:12:35
RITA HARDIMAN Never, (crosstalk) 

00:12:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:12:35
RITA HARDIMAN never become, ah, critical thinkers, never, ah, really reflect critically on the social reality that's presented... (crosstalk) 

00:12:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:12:40
RITA HARDIMAN ...to them, but, ah, but many also do. And then that leads to the next stage of resistance which, ah, I, I found to cutting across, ah, all of the models as well. And that's a stage where the individual, through a variety of, of, ah, of, ah, stimuli. 

00:12:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:12:55
RITA HARDIMAN Begins to question what they have, what their belief system is. 

00:13:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:13:00
RITA HARDIMAN So, this in instance is interjected. And they now begin to question some things that they've been taught or things that they assume, things they take for granted. 

00:13:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But they don't do it gradually. 

00:13:10
RITA HARDIMAN No, no. (crosstalk) 

00:13:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. No, ok. 

00:13:10
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, usually what happens is, uhm, a person will find an exception. 

00:13:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:13:15
RITA HARDIMAN And then, ah, or find a situation that, that contradicts what they know. And then it becomes the exception that proves the rule. 

00:13:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay, okay. 

00:13:25
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, but, ah, for some people, the exceptions build up to a point where they're no longer exceptions. They really challenge the, the order that, that's been created in, in people's thinking. So the questioning is, is the first part of the resistance. 

00:13:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:13:40
RITA HARDIMAN And then, uhm, that leads into a lot of, ah, critical thinking about what one has been taught to believe about their own social identity and that of the other. Uhm, and there's a, it's called resistance... (crosstalk) 

00:13:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:13:55
RITA HARDIMAN ...because there is a, uhm, resisting of what has been taught. 

00:14:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:14:00
RITA HARDIMAN Ah, or rejection, some people would call it a rejection stage. (crosstalk) 

00:14:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:14:05
RITA HARDIMAN Ah, but rejecting a lot of what's been taught. And, uhm, that, that, ah, can lead immediately to the next state, not immediately. It doesn't always happen quickly. (crosstalk) 

00:14:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right, right. And you'll come back with, with your model in. (crosstalk) 

00:14:15
RITA HARDIMAN But it, you know, but it leads into the next stage where, uhm, if I have accepted things about myself... (crosstalk) 

00:14:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:14:20
RITA HARDIMAN And have gone through a process of resisting it, rejecting it, ah, I may not know who I am anymore. 

00:14:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, okay. 

00:14:25
RITA HARDIMAN  So the third, the fourth stage is, ah, is labeled, is called redefinition. And it's, it's called different things and different models. But the essence is that the individual is really searching for who they are then. 

00:14:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  That's to reconstruct... (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:14:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...modify or reinvent even, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
RITA HARDIMAN Right, rediscover... (crosstalk) 

00:14:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:14:45
RITA HARDIMAN  rename... (crosstalk) 

00:14:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:14:50
RITA HARDIMAN Reinvent, uhm, a definition of themselves as a social being... 

00:14:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:14:55
RITA HARDIMAN ...that, ah, in a way that is, ah, ah, to, to the best that they can do is not impacted by oppression. 

00:15:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:15:00
RITA HARDIMAN So that this definition that's being constructed is not influenced by, ah, what oppression tells us. (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:15:10
RITA HARDIMAN About what it means to be that person. 

00:15:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And then the final stage would be? (crosstalk) 

00:15:10
RITA HARDIMAN  And the final stage is the, the, ah, internalization or integration of that new definition into all aspects of the person's life into all, all of the roles. So for example, uhm, ah, it means making sense of an applying a redefined sense of Whiteness or maleness... (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:15:35
RITA HARDIMAN ...or femaleness... (crosstalk) 

00:15:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Or Blackness. 

00:15:35
RITA HARDIMAN ...into, or, or Blackness into, ah, being a teacher or mother... (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:15:40
RITA HARDIMAN ...or a citizen, a neighbor, a daughter. (crosstalk) 

00:15:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. In fact, Bailey often refers to that as the identity matrix where, ah... (crosstalk) 

00:15:45
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. 

00:15:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...a person is more than one thing and he or she has attached to you that, ah, ah, has to become reintegrated. 

00:15:50
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:15:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So that the process itself may have caused, one to highlight a particular identity. But then after that, identity has been worked through, it's reintegrated into the, the total cost there that makes up the total itself. 

00:16:05
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:16:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Well that's a, that's a, a, a wonderful way to get into what really is Rita Hardiman's... (crosstalk) 

00:16:05
RITA HARDIMAN  Uh hmm. 

00:16:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...White identity development model, the, it, I think you are one of the persons to, in fact, play this out and that's an excellent introduction. Now, won't you take your time and walk us through how this plays out with regard to White identity development? 

00:16:20
RITA HARDIMAN Okay, uhm, well, when I looked at the, ah, the nave stage or the, the, ah, pre-socialization stage, uhm, what I, ah, have described is that this is the, how we're born into the world. I, I am, I am born as a, as a White child. So I'm born with a social group membership. But I am not born with all of the baggage attached to that social group membership. (crosstalk) 

00:16:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:16:45
RITA HARDIMAN  So in the naive stage, I am, ah, doing what, ah, what all children do which is finding out about their world... (crosstalk) 

00:16:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:16:55
RITA HARDIMAN And being very curious about, uhm, things that I see. So it's not uncommon to see varied small children at this stage asking questions about color, ah, about physical appearance... (crosstalk) 

00:17:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:17:10
RITA HARDIMAN ...and why do people look this way, why, why does my skin look like this and yours look like that, and so on, a lot of curiosity, ah... (crosstalk) 

00:17:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, 'cause sometimes you'll see a White child on the, on the grocery store and they're not really not being (inaudible ) at all. 

00:17:21
RITA HARDIMAN No. 

00:17:21
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But they are, they embarrass their parents because... (crosstalk) 

00:17:21
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:17:21
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...they would take it as being crude. 

00:17:25
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:17:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And as always a Brown person is a Black person... (crosstalk) 

00:17:25
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:17:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and whatever he touch. (crosstalk) 

00:17:25
RITA HARDIMAN Right. Oh, why, why do her eyes look like that? 

00:17:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, right. 

00:17:30
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah, ah, questions like that. And for the most part in the early, in this early stage, there is not, ah, much judgment attached to that. It's a difference. You have a blue shirt and I have a green shirt. 

00:17:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:17:40
RITA HARDIMAN  So what? You like apples. I like oranges. So what? Ah, you look like this. I look like this. So what? The, it, because, ah, one is not really fully impacted at the age of three, four, five... (crosstalk) 

00:17:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:17:55
RITA HARDIMAN ...with all of the negative bombardment that we get about people of color, that White children get about people's color and on the other side, the, the, the more positive or neutral valence that's given to being White. 

00:18:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:18:10
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, so it's really a, a, a stage of exploration and as a stage we're, we're beginning to, to learn, ah, those messages. 

00:18:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:18:15
RITA HARDIMAN  They're starting to come in, uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:18:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It's interesting, we did a study, uhm, some colleagues and I, Cornell(ph) in which we tried to figure out how race and culture introduce to the, the, ah, the, ah, homes of young children. (crosstalk) 

00:18:30
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:18:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. We focused primarily on Black and White homes. Tsk And we found that, ah, ah, time and again, there were very few, ah, between, between the ages of one and, say, three... (crosstalk) 

00:18:40
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:18:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...with the White children. We could not pick up, ah, indication that the parents were explicitly talking about race. 

00:18:50
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:18:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, it was being introduced, ah, in a fashion that was more passive, at least, for the child. TV was a tremendous way. Uhm, but also if, if, if the mother were to go out and buy a doll, ah, they just, they don't want buy a White doll, but they surely... (crosstalk) 

00:19:05
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:19:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...didn't think about buying a Brown doll. 

00:19:05
RITA HARDIMAN All right. 

00:19:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So they didn't see there's a vehicle for bringing, ah, issues of color into the child's life. 

00:19:10
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:19:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And so as a result, ah, for the most part, it was almost like a buildup of White cues, never really identified. 

00:19:15
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:19:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But that becomes the normal state. 

00:19:15
RITA HARDIMAN Right, right. 

00:19:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:19:20
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah, that, no, that's great. That's, ah, ah, that really accurately describes what I think actually happens... (crosstalk) 

00:19:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:19:25
RITA HARDIMAN ...ah, in the life. 

00:19:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Now, later in your model, you're gonna make a distinction between people being passive and active. But that doesn't take place in this first stage, right? (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
RITA HARDIMAN No, no. (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay, fine, but lets, we'll wait for... (crosstalk) 

00:19:30
RITA HARDIMAN No. 

00:19:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  and then they move into, ah, 

00:19:35
RITA HARDIMAN They move into the stage of acceptance. Now, I don't mean to imply by saying acceptance that, that one, ah, goes into it, goes into it, goes into that stage without a fight. 

00:19:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:19:45
RITA HARDIMAN In fact, in my, ah, dissertation, I and then, in the autobiographies that I, that I, ah, researched. 

00:19:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes. 

00:19:50
RITA HARDIMAN They were many dramatic examples of the White authors talking about experiences, ah, that they had as children where they would develop a friendship with a Black child. 

00:20:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Yeah. 

00:20:05
RITA HARDIMAN Or, ah, or a Native American child, only to find that their parents became very angry... (crosstalk) 

00:20:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:20:10
RITA HARDIMAN ...at that and broke apart the friendship. And the children were terribly confused, didn't understand it. And rebelled against it to a point. 

00:20:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmmm. 

00:20:15
RITA HARDIMAN But, uhm, ultimately, they caved in, and because they're children and parents have more power, they, they caved in. So, uhm, I don't mean to suggest that, that one just slides into, (crosstalk) 

00:20:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:20:25
RITA HARDIMAN you know, acceptance, ah, ah, without questioning a lot what you're taught, and a lot of the rules. But I do believe that because racism isn't, is really, ah, ah, is paramount and it's, it's a cornerstone, I think, of... (crosstalk) 

00:20:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:20:40
RITA HARDIMAN ...American society, U.S. Society, uhm, that it's almost impossible for a White child not to go into resistance. 

00:20:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmmm. 

00:20:50
RITA HARDIMAN Ah, and I've... (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And this is... (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
RITA HARDIMAN I've ar, I've argued with you about... (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, I remember that. (crosstalk) 

00:20:50
RITA HARDIMAN This one's insisted that they are the one exception. 

00:20:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But you do make a distinction now here between passive and, and active, (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
RITA HARDIMAN Yes, I do. Ah... (crosstalk) 

00:20:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  there's some people who you say, who, again, kinda continuing their pre-socialization stage. Ah, it's more of a programming or, ah, ah, ah, imprinting. And you don't get a sense of their being able to discuss this as much as they just accept it that's the way it is. 

00:21:15
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:21:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And that, there are others who were very active. Tell, tell, us what you mean by active. (crosstalk) 

00:21:15
RITA HARDIMAN Okay. Uhm, well it's, it's clear, it's clear to me that there are, ah, there's a segment of White society that gets very actively socialized to be White in a very conscious sense. 

00:21:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:21:30
RITA HARDIMAN To think of oneself as superior, to think of oneself as part of the master race. And we, we know those examples. 

00:21:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:21:35
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, we know that there are children who are raised in the Ku Klux Klan and the Aryan Nation and, ah, all of the other White Supremist, (crosstalk) 

00:21:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:21:45
RITA HARDIMAN ah, groups that, that exist. So, there are, uhm, there is a segment who, I, I refer to, ah, as being in the active acceptance stage. They actively believe, ah, that Whites are superior. They, ah, they act out, ah, frequently in very hostile ways toward people of color. 

00:22:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:22:05
RITA HARDIMAN Ah, tend to, to only associate with Whites. And, unlike Whites in passive acceptance, tend to be very clear that they're White. 

00:22:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Yeah. 

00:22:15
RITA HARDIMAN It's not an unconscious thing that I don't think about. In a, for them, it's very much something that they think about a lot. 

00:22:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. A lot. 

00:22:20
RITA HARDIMAN And put a lot of energy into it. I do think that's a minority. But I, but I did feel that I needed to mention that, that rule. (crosstalk) 

00:22:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. That's a good, excellent point. I remember, when I was, ah, I spent a year growing up in Virginia. I was about six or seven, and had friendship with a young lad, ah, across the street. And then at a certain critical point, ah, uhm, ah, he called me nigger, (crosstalk) 

00:22:40
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:22:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. and, ah, I didn't know what it meant and I came home to my mom and talked about it, but then she began to say let's not do that. So, we almost went to a stage where we were playing, that wasn't an issue, ah, and then at a certain point, it became an issue, and he seemed to become aggressive about it. And, ah, it was confusing. 

00:23:00
RITA HARDIMAN Uh-huh. 

00:23:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And yet, and now that you're, you're talking about it, you can see where in a sense he went from being passive, he probably had some of those notions in his mind. 

00:23:05
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:23:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Something must've triggered him to be more active right now. (crosstalk) 

00:23:05
RITA HARDIMAN Right, right. I think that the, the passive uhm. 

00:23:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Oh, we should, we should probably should point out that sometimes... (crosstalk) 

00:23:15
RITA HARDIMAN Oh. 

00:23:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...children can, ah, be reactive and yet they'll play that out cognitively, and yet they still want to play with friends. (crosstalk) 

00:23:20
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:23:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So that immediacy and the, kind of, locking into that doesn't take place to it 'til they're older. (crosstalk) 

00:23:25
RITA HARDIMAN Till later, right. I think they're, they're imitating some adult, (crosstalk) 

00:23:25
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. 

00:23:25
RITA HARDIMAN adult role models. 

00:23:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Right. 

00:23:30
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. Uhm, (crosstalk) 

00:23:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And then that leads us to the next stage. 

00:23:30
RITA HARDIMAN Well, I wanna say a little bit more about the passive. (crosstalk) 

00:23:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Sure, okay. 

00:23:35
RITA HARDIMAN Passive side, 'cause, because I do think this is more representative of, of more, many, many more Whites... (crosstalk) 

00:23:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:23:40
RITA HARDIMAN ...than the active. And that is, uhm, for, for many Whites, ah, it's growing up with, ah, not ever having to think about being White. 

00:23:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:23:50
RITA HARDIMAN And that's particularly true for those of us who, who did not grow up in racially mixed environments. Uhm, grew up in White suburbia. 

00:24:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:24:00
RITA HARDIMAN Or rural, White rural America. Uhm, and who really grow up, I think, taking whiteness for granted. 

00:24:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:24:05
RITA HARDIMAN And again, thinking of it as, as the way the world is, not as being a member of a particular group. 

00:24:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:24:10
RITA HARDIMAN And, usually, you're only aware of being a member of a particular group when you go in the Army or... (crosstalk) 

00:24:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:24:15
RITA HARDIMAN ...go to college or whatever, and you, and you'll encounter someone who's, who's Black or Hispanic, Asian or, or American Indian. Uhm, so there's a real unconsciousness. And because of that, there's a lack of understanding about how one really is a cultural person. 

00:24:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:24:35
RITA HARDIMAN When it's not neutral? You, you don't have the culture. (crosstalk) 

00:24:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:24:40
RITA HARDIMAN Ah, I have one, too. 

00:24:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:24:40
RITA HARDIMAN Ah, but that, not knowing that, creates terrible blinders, so that, ah, and it leads to bias that, that's been written about extensively in the counseling literature, and in, in some other fields, as well. 

00:24:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:24:50
RITA HARDIMAN  Ah, just not knowing that one's using a White framework. The other part of the, of the, ah, passive acceptance is, uhm, a lot of, uhm, tsk unconscious, ah, stereotypes, a lot of unconscious behaviors around avoidance, ah, of people of color. (crosstalk) 

00:25:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uhm. 

00:25:10
RITA HARDIMAN A real lack of comfort, ah, being with people of color. Uhm, one may not be, be vocal about, ah, stereotypes, about, ah, racist beliefs that they have. 

00:25:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm 

00:25:25
RITA HARDIMAN But they believe them nonetheless. 

00:25:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:25:25
RITA HARDIMAN And it impacts behavior. Uhm. 

00:25:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. There is a part, it becomes a part of the frame of reference. 

00:25:30
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:25:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And, in some case, because they've accepted it, not really questioned it, ah, they sometimes can't see it... (crosstalk) 

00:25:35
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:25:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and get it, this, this is operating. 

00:25:40
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:25:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:25:40
RITA HARDIMAN There, there is, right. And exactly because I can't see it. 

00:25:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Uh hmm. 

00:25:45
RITA HARDIMAN I'm mat, I'm very likely at the stage of passive acceptance, to deny that I'm part of the problem. 

00:25:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Right. 

00:25:50
RITA HARDIMAN So, there's a real, ah, investment in denying that I'm racist in any way. 

00:25:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Yeah. 

00:25:55
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, and the denial that, ah, I may be implicated, in any way, in, in societal racism. 

00:26:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:26:00
RITA HARDIMAN There's really no understanding of that. No connection of my White privilege to, ah, understanding of, ah, societal racism. 

00:26:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So, for a more positive reasons most people end up, at this point, passively. 

00:26:15
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:26:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, we don't want to forget, however, the reactive group... (crosstalk) 

00:26:20
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:26:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...we're seeing that, unfortunately, in today's society... (crosstalk) 

00:26:25
RITA HARDIMAN All right. 

00:26:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...especially in the last twelve years. And we'll see more of it probably with the, with, ah, the economy. 

00:26:30
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:26:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Being rather tough right now. And then, ah, that's just the stage for moving to the possibility of a, a re-definition, all right? Ah. 

00:26:35
RITA HARDIMAN Resistance. (crosstalk) 

00:26:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Resistance, I'm sorry. (crosstalk) 

00:26:40
RITA HARDIMAN Resistance. 

00:26:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Resistance, yes. 

00:26:40
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, yes, ah, but again I, I wanna emphasize that that it's possible to stay in a stage of acceptance for all of one's life. 

00:26:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes. 

00:26:50
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, and to never allow any, ah, dissonance or contradictory. 

00:26:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:26:55
RITA HARDIMAN Messages or situations to break through that, that, ah, world view that's personal acceptance. But what I found in, uhm, in during my study and my dissertation, and also in the 14 or so years of, of practice that I've had working with Whites in all kinds of institutions throughout this country, I've, I have found, uhm, many who have, ah, entered the stage of resistance, and have had a number of life experiences that have, ah, challenged them to critically examine... (crosstalk) 

00:27:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:27:30
RITA HARDIMAN ...the assumptions of, of the passive acceptance stage. Uhm, so, ah, I'd like to say a few things about the transition. (crosstalk) 

00:27:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Sure. 

00:27:40
RITA HARDIMAN Ah, for, for some people, uhm, what causes the, the transition or the movement is a result of a, of a relationship that they have. 

00:27:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:27:50
RITA HARDIMAN With the person of color, be it a roommate or a, a friend or a, ah, or even intimate relationship, ah, where they begin to learn things about that person's life experience that really contradicted what they've been taught to believe about, ah, freedom, (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:28:05
RITA HARDIMAN justice, you know, liberty for all, (crosstalk) 

00:28:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Uh hmm 

00:28:10
RITA HARDIMAN all of that stuff. Uhm, for other people, it's not so much to a personal relationship, but it's more, ah, cataclysmic social events. The assassination of Martin Luther King, (crosstalk) 

00:28:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:28:20
RITA HARDIMAN uhm, ah, the riots, ah, for some people now, ah, ah, ah, it could be the Rodney King, ah, incident. But there, and it isn't usually just one. 

00:28:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:28:30
RITA HARDIMAN It's usually a series of things that begins to chip away. 

00:28:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:28:35
RITA HARDIMAN At this world view of acceptance. And it causes one to really question, and, and, ah, try to, to, to, ah, dig around and fear, ah, what, what have I really bought? 

00:28:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:28:45
RITA HARDIMAN What have I really been taught about the social reality around me? And also, what have I been taught about myself? 

00:28:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:28:50
RITA HARDIMAN  Some people, it's, it's, when they leave the country. 

00:28:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay, yes, yes. 

00:28:55
RITA HARDIMAN And they go to Japan, or somewhere in Africa, (crosstalk) 

00:29:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:29:00
RITA HARDIMAN or around the world and realize, "Oh, my God! White people are minority in the world." 

00:29:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:29:05
RITA HARDIMAN Ah, you know, (crosstalk) 

00:29:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:29:05
RITA HARDIMAN not everyone is, is, ah, like the way we are in the U.S. And that's the contradictory experience for them. But whatever the, the stimulus, uhm, ah, for many people that leads into the beginning of resistance stage, which is asking a lot of questions. 

00:29:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:29:20
RITA HARDIMAN And it's ah, uhm, a very difficult stage for Whites and you talked about it... (crosstalk) 

00:29:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes, Uh hmm. 

00:29:25
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah, in, in your model, and Bailey's model. Ah, it's difficult for, ah, people who are racially oppressed. 

00:29:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:29:30
RITA HARDIMAN  But it's, it's particularly difficult for, for Whites, I think, because what you begin to uncover is a lot of your old, ah, baggage that you don't wanna look at. 

00:29:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Okay. 

00:29:45
RITA HARDIMAN So. (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Now, all of a sudden, those things, you've accepted... (crosstalk) 

00:29:45
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:29:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...in a passive fashion becomes something rather, rather hard to look at. 

00:29:50
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:29:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:29:50
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. So, for a lot of people, there's a feeling of, uhm, of almost embarrassment. 

00:29:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:29:55
RITA HARDIMAN There are certainly some feelings of, of shame. 

00:30:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:30:00
RITA HARDIMAN Some guilt. There's, uhm, ah, feelings of anger as well, in having been, ah, sold the bill of goods. 

00:30:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:30:05
RITA HARDIMAN And that's really what it feels like. 

00:30:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:30:10
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, and again, what I would refer back to my dissertation, I, ah, in going through all of the autobiographies of these White authors... (crosstalk) 

00:30:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hhmm. 

00:30:15
RITA HARDIMAN ...many of them speak right eloquently about what that was like for them when the light bulb went off. 

00:30:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:30:25
RITA HARDIMAN And they really felt like, uhm, tsk ah, things were shattering. 

00:30:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:30:30
RITA HARDIMAN You know, all, (crosstalk) 

00:30:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:30:30
RITA HARDIMAN all around them. 

00:30:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Almost things falling apart. 

00:30:35
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. 

00:30:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. 'Coz in some ways, you're saying that a very basic frame of reference which had been operating, if not on the unconscious, as a backdrop, now becomes in the forefront. 

00:30:40
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:30:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  And all of the sudden it is viewed with such utter detail and discovered that what appeared to fit doesn't fit. 

00:30:50
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:30:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. New information showing that it, it, it is not the logical conclusion. 

00:30:50
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:30:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  It's not the way I wanna be. 

00:30:55
RITA HARDIMAN Right, right. It. (crosstalk) 

00:30:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And that, that's gonna be brilliant. People can, ah, that can be as traumatic almost as physical, uhm, ah, attack. 

00:31:00
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. 

00:31:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Because in a sense, we have to have some sense of stability as we move, you know, in our situations. And, ah, essentially, you're saying the foundation is being... (crosstalk) 

00:31:10
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:31:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...right, it's being (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:31:12
RITA HARDIMAN Right, and, and it is almost like things are turning upside down. 

00:31:12
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes. 

00:31:12
RITA HARDIMAN Because, if I have bought all my life that, uhm, that this is the land of equal opportunity. 

00:31:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:31:20
RITA HARDIMAN And that the reason that there is so much poverty in, in the Black community or, or, ah, so much, ah, alcoholism in the American-Indian community or whatever... (crosstalk) 

00:31:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:31:25
RITA HARDIMAN ...is because that's, sort of, the way those people are. 

00:31:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:31:30
RITA HARDIMAN Now, I understand that I am part, and my group is a part of a, of a very powerful social system. 

00:31:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:31:40
RITA HARDIMAN That really, ah, has created, ah, ah, you know, racism, since this country was founded. Uhm, and that, I can't think of anything more jarring than that. (crosstalk) 

00:31:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. And yet ironically, unless the person reaches this stage, they can't change. 

00:31:55
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:31:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. In the sense, ah, before you can change, there has to usually be some sort of, ah, unintended challenge, ah, because your identity really works to protect you against change. 

00:32:05
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:32:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And that's good because it keeps you integrated, it keeps you connected. And here, you're describing a situation where, ah, it kinda comes apart enough, so the person experiences some enemy, some, some reason to question. 

00:32:15
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:32:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And that can be painful but nonetheless is necessary. 

00:32:15
RITA HARDIMAN  Right, right. 

00:32:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes. 

00:32:20
RITA HARDIMAN And, and again, I, I don't mean to suggest that, that this is, ah, that this is easy. This process... (crosstalk) 

00:32:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. No (inaudible ). 

00:32:27
RITA HARDIMAN ...happens in an easy fashion. And I think there is a lot of resistance to the resistance. 

00:32:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:32:30
RITA HARDIMAN There's a lot of, ah, saying "Gee, I am, I'm not sure I wanna think that yet." 

00:32:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. No. 

00:32:35
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:32:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. In fact, you'll get people very defensive. 

00:32:35
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:32:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uhm, almost a kneejerk kind of defense. 

00:32:40
RITA HARDIMAN Right. (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:32:40
RITA HARDIMAN Right. One of the things that happens, uhm, to, not to all, but to some people at this stage, to some Whites, is that the understanding and the implication of, of, uhm, my racial identity, in the, in the racial oppression of others. Uhm, can lead them to a stage, a state where they really feel very negative about Whites. 

00:33:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Okay. 

00:33:05
RITA HARDIMAN Very negative about, ah, ones group. I remember being in, being in the stage myself, I've talked to number of others. Ah, Judith Caths(ph) who's a friend and a dear, dear friend and colleague, has also spoke with me a lot about this, of just finding it very difficult for a period of time of finding anything good about being White. 

00:33:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:33:20
RITA HARDIMAN  Uhm, and at that, fortunately, I think passes. 

00:33:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:33:25
RITA HARDIMAN But for some people, it, it seems to be a necessary part of the stage. Uhm, and it's not a comfortable place to be, uhm, but there's a, a resistance to the definition of Whiteness that we have been given. 

00:33:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Kind of a, the White has been (inaudible ) kind of thing sometimes. (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
RITA HARDIMAN Well, it can. (crosstalk) 

00:33:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Because the person on the one hand is, ah, feeling some sense of embarrassment and shame. But usually by this, this point, their feeling as though they have arrived a little bit, you're right. (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
RITA HARDIMAN Absolutely, absolutely. And that it's more superior otherwise. (crosstalk) 

00:33:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And so it's, it's, it's measured by... (crosstalk) 

00:33:55
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:33:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ..where you were at now. 

00:33:55
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:33:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And, ah, such people can be good foot soldiers. On the other hand, they can be, uhm, uhm, monsters to handle... (crosstalk) 

00:34:00
RITA HARDIMAN  Yes. 

00:34:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...in these useful(ph) situations. 

00:34:05
RITA HARDIMAN Exactly, exactly, the same. (crosstalk) 

00:34:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It's a kind of (inaudible ) in a sense. 

00:34:09
RITA HARDIMAN Right, right. There are some people who'd, who do get into that. 

00:34:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. This has less to do with an affirmation of something as much as indication of it, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:34:15
RITA HARDIMAN Right, and it's so rejecting. 

00:34:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:34:15
RITA HARDIMAN And, ah, and, ah, resistance to the prevailing definition of Whiteness. 

00:34:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:34:20
RITA HARDIMAN Which is that White people are superior or we've become more sophisticated now. We don't talk about being superior, we just, we just assume that we're normal. 

00:34:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  And, and there are some people. (crosstalk) 

00:34:30
RITA HARDIMAN With, with the norm. 

00:34:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. Some people, when they're attacking what they, I don't like the term, the PC, ah, movement. 

00:34:35
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:34:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, in fact, they even call that a PC movement, ah, as opposed to looking at some fact that, ah, here are some people, ah, not debunking America but questioning it, and showing that, ah, it, like any nation, being that it has its, ah, its texture and some of it is unattractive. But that gets, taken by some people who are so defensive as, "Oh you're, you're attacking America." (crosstalk) 

00:34:55
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:34:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. "You're, you're totally downing it." And they, they, kneejerk, jerk fast, they almost like to defend the whole caboodle in a naive fashion. 

00:35:00
RITA HARDIMAN Right, right. 

00:35:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:35:00
RITA HARDIMAN  Right. 

00:35:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So then we finally got your point where if a person progresses, they redefine. 

00:35:10
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:35:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. You re, refer to this next day as a redefinition stage. (crosstalk) 

00:35:10
RITA HARDIMAN Redefinition, yes. Uhm, because what, what happens as a result of, of, ah, of a lot of the questioning and a lot of the, uhm, not only the changes and beliefs and assumptions but the changes and behavior, uhm, are that, that, ah, I can, ah, leave the stage or I, I can reach a point and a stage where I don't know what it means to, to be White. (crosstalk) 

00:35:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:35:35
RITA HARDIMAN And I do not know how to be White. 

00:35:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Okay. 

00:35:40
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, and that, that's another part that can be very confusing for Whites. (crosstalk) 

00:35:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:35:40
RITA HARDIMAN  If you look back through the history, ah, uhm, the long history of the Civil Rights Movement. 

00:35:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:35:50
RITA HARDIMAN For the, the struggle for, for justice, uhm, ah, particularly among the Black population, there have historically always been Whites who have been supporters of that. 

00:36:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:36:00
RITA HARDIMAN But I think what happens at that resistance stage is that, for some White, there is a, uhm, there's a real loss of identity in not knowing what to do. 

00:36:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Right. 

00:36:10
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, ah, when I read, ah, autobiographies, I found a number of who, of Whites who wrote about being active in the Civil Rights Movement in the 60's. 

00:36:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:36:15
RITA HARDIMAN Who were really thrown for a loop when they were, in effect, thrown out of, or felt like they were thrown out of... (crosstalk) 

00:36:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:36:25
RITA HARDIMAN ...the movement. Because they, they really didn't know how to be White other than to be... (crosstalk) 

00:36:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Even. (inaudible ) (crosstalk) 

00:36:32
RITA HARDIMAN ...how, be in the movement and to be helpful. 

00:36:32
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:36:32
RITA HARDIMAN  And so I think, what, what the, being in the resistance stage leads you to is wondering who am I? What am I about? What is my responsibility, ah, as a White American in this whole racial picture? 

00:36:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. In fact I, I recall that there's an episode with, uhm, in the early revolution or in part of the wom, women's movement, that there would be some women who were participating in the, ah, Southern Civil Rights Movement. 

00:37:00
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:37:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, who, who go on, become major voices in the, in that, of the, of the other movement. Well, anyway, they were, they were often described as, uhm, not knowing how to resist Black men, who, ah, almost summarily felt as though they should have physical relationships with them, you know? (crosstalk) 

00:37:15
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm, uh hmm. 

00:37:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. You know, uhm, and it was confusing because the one would say, "Well, they really didn't seem right but on the other hand, uhm, they almost described a part where they had no anchors. 

00:37:25
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:37:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And that, uhm, literally, it sounds crude now, they felt like they were serving some, sort of, cause by making themselves available. 

00:37:35
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:37:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And some of the men clearly knew what they were doing. They were exploring... (crosstalk) 

00:37:35
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:37:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and they were taking advantage, literally, of someone who, who is trying to figure out, you know, how to connect, ah, he, here in a case of a very intimate level, ah, who's, I guess, was clear sometimes during the day when they were doing the marches and so on. 

00:37:50
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But it was a, a very unattractive part... (crosstalk) 

00:37:50
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:37:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...of, ah, what women often like, White women often went through. 

00:37:55
RITA HARDIMAN Right, right. (crosstalk) 

00:37:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. Now, there're analogues with Blacks, ah, ah, Blacks, ah, joining groups and wanting to be the right kind of Black person. 

00:38:00
RITA HARDIMAN Right. (crosstalk) 

00:38:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And therefore being susceptible to, uhm, ah, a leader who was taking them in a certain direction. 

00:38:05
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:38:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:38:05
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. 

00:38:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Anyway, go ahead. 

00:38:05
RITA HARDIMAN  But, ah, the, the, there is a, I think there really is a void. 

00:38:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:38:10
RITA HARDIMAN Because, uhm, if you, if you reject and are successful at, at resisting what the world has told you about what it means to be White, there really is a, a big emptiness. 

00:38:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:38:25
RITA HARDIMAN Because so much of what we are taught is, is imbued with racism. 

00:38:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:38:30
RITA HARDIMAN That if you take the racism out, that, it's like you're, you're taking the peanut out of the shell and then you left the shell and what, what's in the shell. And so, I think that, uhm, that that question about who am I? What does it mean to be White? What is my role? How can I be, uhm, uhm, effective in, (crosstalk) 

00:38:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:38:50
RITA HARDIMAN in, ah, ah, struggle for racial justice? How can I feel okay about who I am. 

00:38:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:38:55
RITA HARDIMAN And okay about my history and my culture and my, my, ah, ancestors, uhm, leads into the re-definition stage. And that's a very, very difficult stage, like I... (crosstalk) 

00:39:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. (inaudible ) (laughs) 

00:39:07
RITA HARDIMAN ...keep (laughs) saying, they were all difficult but what, what I think is particularly difficult about, about this one is that it is, I think by definition, ah, one cannot resolve this stage alone. 

00:39:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. Oh, okay. (crosstalk) 

00:39:15
RITA HARDIMAN  One has to do it with others. 

00:39:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:39:20
RITA HARDIMAN And then that's where you get into the problem because there seem to be so few others. 

00:39:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Ah, okay. 

00:39:25
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, I, I, I would have to say that, ah, my experiences that most Whites remain stuck in acceptance. There are some who move in to resistance and there is some colleagues of mine who, who I know, who have lived in resistance. 

00:39:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:39:40
RITA HARDIMAN They are still very angry. They're still, ah, angry at other Whites. 

00:39:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:39:45
RITA HARDIMAN They are, ah, operating out of, uhm, what I think of in some ways as, as a reactive mode, rather than of a proactive mode. 

00:39:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:39:50
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, about their work, ah, but are not asking the question about, about their own identity... (crosstalk) 

00:40:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:40:00
RITA HARDIMAN ...as a member of a, of a particular race. So, uhm, it, it, that can make this stage very, very challenging because it, it, I think it's necessary that it, that it'd be experienced with other Whites who were at the same stage and in dialogue with other Whites who were at the same stage. It, it really is, ah, impossible when you think about... (crosstalk) 

00:40:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

00:40:20
RITA HARDIMAN ...to, for an individual to try to redefine a social group. 

00:40:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I, I, and again... (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
RITA HARDIMAN A social group has to redefine a social group. (crosstalk) 

00:40:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...I think that carries, over cross the other groups that we're talking about. 

00:40:30
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:40:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. I think that, to change one as blackness, typically, cannot be done by oneself. 

00:40:35
RITA HARDIMAN Right. (crosstalk) 

00:40:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But at a certain point, it had, it's a share, it's a social event. 

00:40:35
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:40:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uhm, uhm, I think the same thing with, ah, gender identity. 

00:40:40
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:40:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uhm, gay, the gay, ah, lesbian (inaudible ). (crosstalk) 

00:40:46
RITA HARDIMAN And lesbian identity. 

00:40:46
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:40:46
RITA HARDIMAN Certainly. And. (crosstalk) 

00:40:46
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Which is, may explain why after a while, identity movements become collectives which have their ups and downs but nonetheless, ah, their primary purpose is to help people kinda bounce ideas off, share experiences, realizing they're not the only one involved... (crosstalk) 

00:41:00
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:41:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...and so on. 

00:41:00
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:41:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. This is a very powerful thing in the 12-Step Programs. too, by the way. 

00:41:00
RITA HARDIMAN  Uh-huh. (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Where people again, you can't do the 12-Step Program, you can't recover... (crosstalk) 

00:41:05
RITA HARDIMAN By yourself. 

00:41:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...by yourself. 

00:41:05
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:41:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, it just didn't happen that way. (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
RITA HARDIMAN Right. (crosstalk) 

00:41:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So. 

00:41:10
RITA HARDIMAN Yup. 

00:41:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. But nonetheless, this is the time where a person all of a sudden becomes, ah, ah, less Rita Hardiman White than Rita Hardiman who's Irish. And looking at one's Irishness for, with a different point of view, ah, (crosstalk) 

00:41:20
RITA HARDIMAN Po, Possibly. 

00:41:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. from a cultural point of view. (crosstalk) 

00:41:25
RITA HARDIMAN Possibly. (crosstalk) 

00:41:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:41:25
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. I think that, that, uhm, that for some people, what happens at this stage is a, uhm, is a desire to understand who they are ethnically as well as racially. 

00:41:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:41:35
RITA HARDIMAN And I think that if it, if that happens at an earlier stage, I'm, I'm a little bit more suspect of it. 

00:41:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Why? (crosstalk) 

00:41:40
RITA HARDIMAN Because I think, I think sometimes we, we go from issue to issue... (crosstalk) 

00:41:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:41:45
RITA HARDIMAN ...to avoid some issues. 

00:41:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:41:50
RITA HARDIMAN But I think at this stage, uhm, of redefinition, one of the things that, that can happen in, in the questioning... (crosstalk) 

00:41:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:41:55
RITA HARDIMAN ...about what does it mean to be white is, for many of us, it leads to an understanding of an ethnic heritage, an ethnic identity that has been lost... (crosstalk) 

00:42:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes. 

00:42:05
RITA HARDIMAN ...to varying degrees. Uhm, and, uhm, I've only recently begun to do some exploration of the relationship between ethnic identity of Whites. 

00:42:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:42:15
RITA HARDIMAN And the racial identity of Whites. But what, what strikes me is that, uhm, is that the European immigrants who came here to the U.S., at varying points in history, did not leave the, their country of origin... (crosstalk) 

00:42:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:42:30
RITA HARDIMAN ...thinking of themselves as White. 

00:42:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:42:30
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, they thought of themselves as German or Irish or French... (crosstalk) 

00:42:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:42:35
RITA HARDIMAN ...or Italian, whatever. Ah, but when they came to America, ah, they were given, I think of it as almost being given a, a pass cart. 

00:42:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:42:40
RITA HARDIMAN That you can, (crosstalk) 

00:42:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Sure. 

00:42:40
RITA HARDIMAN  you can be a member of the powerful group in this country because you're White. 

00:42:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:42:45
RITA HARDIMAN  And you can do that particularly well if you will submerge your ethnicity. 

00:42:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Submerge your ethnicity or use it as a, uhm, almost, uhm, one that gets mashed into a notion of Americaness. 

00:43:00
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:43:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And, how do you know that? 'Coz you're not Black. 

00:43:00
RITA HARDIMAN  Right. 

00:43:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And how do you play that out, well. (crosstalk) 

00:43:05
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:43:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. We're not gonna let them in the union. 

00:43:05
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:43:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. They're not gonna be in management. 

00:43:05
RITA HARDIMAN  Right. 

00:43:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And it, there's a lot of clarity to that, not in terms of who you are, but who you're not. (crosstalk) 

00:43:10
RITA HARDIMAN  Yeah, yeah. There's a woman that we met or that, that we saw a few years ago at Columbia. Her, I don't remember her first name, but her last name was Roffman(ph). 

00:43:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:43:20
RITA HARDIMAN Who, ah, at this Matsonia(ph), (crosstalk) 

00:43:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes. 

00:43:25
RITA HARDIMAN who has done a lot of work... (crosstalk) 

00:43:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Oh, my powerful person. (crosstalk) 

00:43:25
RITA HARDIMAN ...on, uhm, on this notion. (crosstalk) 

00:43:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hope for (inaudible ), I think it is hope for (inaudible ). 

00:43:32
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. I don't, I don't recall. (crosstalk) 

00:43:32
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. She's at Matsonia(ph) now, right now. 

00:43:32
RITA HARDIMAN Right. But she's done a lot of research on when Whiteness really, her, became a, a category. 

00:43:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Uh hmm. 

00:43:40
RITA HARDIMAN Ah, when this, ah, notion of it became a, a category in the U.S. And I think that for, for European immigrants, they left a, a, uhm, uhm, a continent with tremendous ethnic... (crosstalk) 

00:43:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:43:50
RITA HARDIMAN ...ah, warfare, uhm, among, uhm, among ah, amongst other Whites. 

00:43:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:43:55
RITA HARDIMAN Ah, so they, they left, sort of, an ethnic hierarchy and entered the U.S. where there is both a racial hierarchy and an ethnic hierarchy. 

00:44:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And by the way, for, for the time period between 1890 or 1880 and 1920, we're talking about the time in which, uhm, ah, White nationalism... (crosstalk) 

00:44:10
RITA HARDIMAN  Uh hmm. 

00:44:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...first expulse in the south. 

00:44:15
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:44:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Became a national ideology and, ah, so that all you, you have all these people coming forth, and in a sense, that was the social definition that was being pushed officially. The clan, ah, was able to elect a governor, at least one or two states... (crosstalk) 

00:44:30
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:44:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...during this time period. 

00:44:30
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:44:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And so, if you will, that seemed to be the accepted reality. 

00:44:35
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:44:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And it was quite codified, if you live in the South, of course... (crosstalk) 

00:44:35
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:44:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...it was, ah, originally, so as to the partite as nation of that police(ph) state. 

00:44:40
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:44:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And so these White immigrants would often come in and that would be the reality. 

00:44:45
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:44:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:44:45
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. 

00:44:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, at some point. 

00:44:45
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. So, I think that, that part of what can happen at the redefinition is a, is a sorting out of the relationship between the ethnic identity and the racial identity. 

00:44:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:44:55
RITA HARDIMAN I don't think that that's true for, for everyone. 

00:44:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:44:55
RITA HARDIMAN  Uhm, I'm a, uhm, uhm, the only, the second generation, ah, in my, that's, in my family born in this country. My, ah, both of my grandparents on my father's side immigrated and great grandparents on my mother's side immigrated. (crosstalk) 

00:45:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:45:10
RITA HARDIMAN So, I'm somewhat more connected to another country... (crosstalk) 

00:45:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:45:15
RITA HARDIMAN ...or, or nation of origin than, for example, a White person whose family has been here for 15... (crosstalk) 

00:45:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:45:20
RITA HARDIMAN ...generations. 

00:45:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  And perhaps, it's the reality with ethnicity, yeah. (crosstalk) 

00:45:25
RITA HARDIMAN Who doesn't have a strong, yeah, who doesn't have a strong ethnic identity. 

00:45:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:45:25
RITA HARDIMAN  But, uhm, I think there is that sorting out that happens and there is a, uhm, uhm, there are attempts at the redefinition stage to reach, ah, of, some sense of peace. 

00:45:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:45:40
RITA HARDIMAN I think with oneself as a member of the White group. 

00:45:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:45:45
RITA HARDIMAN It does not mean, uhm, not being, uhm, committed to racial justice. 

00:45:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. (crosstalk) 

00:45:50
RITA HARDIMAN It does not mean not being committed to understanding other cultures and being as, as culturally competent as one can be. But it is a more inward stage... (crosstalk) 

00:46:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:46:00
RITA HARDIMAN ...of focusing on who am I and getting clear about, ah, what the social group membership means to me and how I'm going to act based on that. 

00:46:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

00:46:10
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, because it, it, if you think about it, ah, behaviors and actions would be very different in each one of these stages. (crosstalk) 

00:46:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:46:15
RITA HARDIMAN  Uhm, I'm not going to be the same White person in the supermarket, (crosstalk) 

00:46:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Right. 

00:46:25
RITA HARDIMAN in the classroom, as a mother... (crosstalk) 

00:46:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

00:46:25
RITA HARDIMAN ...ah, as a, ah, you know, as a political citizen. 

00:46:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:46:30
RITA HARDIMAN Ah, at the redefinition stage that I would be at the acceptance stage. 

00:46:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Definitely. (crosstalk) 

00:46:35
RITA HARDIMAN I am making very different choices, uhm, about how I act and who I am with and, and how I carry myself. 

00:46:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. In fact, that's, people sometimes think, ah, where the person becomes totally new or they really doubt in... (crosstalk) 

00:46:50
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. 

00:46:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...in the sense of personality but they do become very new in a social sense. Sometimes their social network is different. 

00:46:55
RITA HARDIMAN Yes. 

00:46:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uhm, that they, they may, they may like the same kind of people but nonetheless, maybe drawn to the same kind of people but nonetheless, the same people who'll have, what, different frames of reference, (crosstalk) 

00:47:05
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:47:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. one that matches a new frame of reference. (crosstalk) 

00:47:05
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:47:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, or they'll, they'll hook it with people who are going to change as themselves. This is that collective component that you're... (crosstalk) 

00:47:10
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:47:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...talking about. 

00:47:10
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:47:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Sometimes, though, in the case of a leader or person that has a leadership ability, they will form new groups and, ah, and, and push that, ah, forward, you know. (crosstalk) 

00:47:20
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm, uh hmm. The, the person who, if I, if I could refer people to an individual who I would encourage them to read more about, it would be Robert Terry(ph)... (crosstalk) 

00:47:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

00:47:30
RITA HARDIMAN ...and many of the things that he's written. Some of them were written back in, way back in the '70's. (crosstalk) 

00:47:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:47:35
RITA HARDIMAN But they're as relevant today... (crosstalk) 

00:47:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes. 

00:47:35
RITA HARDIMAN ...as they were then. 

00:47:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes. 

00:47:35
RITA HARDIMAN And he really is one of the few people that I've met and, and talked with who is, is, uhm, very much interested in, in, ah, framing, uhm, an idea of a new White person. 

00:47:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:47:50
RITA HARDIMAN What that means in the, in the current context of, of, ah, of view as society. 

00:47:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Now, it's interesting because people who would like kinda think, well, is there really a need for another stage? But there is. 

00:48:00
RITA HARDIMAN Ah, and. (crosstalk) 

00:48:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And you'd call it internalization. (crosstalk) 

00:48:00
RITA HARDIMAN Right, right. 

00:48:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Well, tell us about that. 

00:48:05
RITA HARDIMAN Well, uhm, it's called. (crosstalk) 

00:48:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Now, I'll learn how to pronounce that. I forgot that, so, (laughs) (inaudible ) okay. 

00:48:12
RITA HARDIMAN (laughs) It's called internalization because I think what, what, ah, I, I've meant by that is, is that you, ah, take into yourself this redefinition. 

00:48:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:48:20
RITA HARDIMAN  And become that new person. And, uhm. 

00:48:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Becomes a habit. 

00:48:25
RITA HARDIMAN It becomes a habit. (crosstalk) 

00:48:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes. 

00:48:25
RITA HARDIMAN  And it is not something that you have to be conscious of. 

00:48:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:48:30
RITA HARDIMAN So, the decisions that I make, the choices that, that I make, uhm, are not the kinda thing that I'll have to ponder. 

00:48:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:48:40
RITA HARDIMAN Now, let's see. How would I do this if I were (laughs) a redefined White. (crosstalk) 

00:48:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. (inaudible ) 

00:48:45
RITA HARDIMAN  versus a resistance or acceptance White? It is, it just becomes who I am. So, uhm, you've used, I think, the term, and others have used the term "integration." 

00:48:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:48:50
RITA HARDIMAN And that, that's another, ah, I think, there's word to use. Ah, ah, I integrated the new definition into all of who I am. 

00:49:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:49:00
RITA HARDIMAN And I'm, lots of things. Uhm, I have the roles that I've, that I've mentioned, though, a parent, a teacher, a taxpayer or, ah, you know, citizen of the, of the... (crosstalk) 

00:49:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:49:10
RITA HARDIMAN (inaudible ) my community, but I'm also, all of my other social identities. 

00:49:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:49:15
RITA HARDIMAN So, I'm, ah, a woman, ah, of, of Irish ancestry, ah, of middle class origins, uhm, heterosexual, uhm, raised, ah, Catholic, uhm, no longer quite there but, (crosstalk) 

00:49:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:49:30
RITA HARDIMAN but certainly, it's part of my, my personal history. Uhm. 

00:49:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And that's an important point to make that just because one has worked through these very important issues around race. After that's been settled, reintegrated into your total identity matrix. You may have to go through some changes with regard to some other characteristics... (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:49:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...or some other component, correct? (crosstalk) 

00:49:50
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:49:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  That just because you worked through the Whiteness thing, it may not mean that you worked through your homophobia. 

00:50:00
RITA HARDIMAN Right. (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Or, or, or maybe you worked it through with Blacks but you still have to work it through... (crosstalk) 

00:50:00
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:50:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ... with Japanese... (crosstalk) 

00:50:05
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:50:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...or whatever. And this is true now, if a White people for Blacks and for, ah, I, again, you can, you can meet gays and lesbians who worked through a coming out process and we sometimes think that means you're gonna be more progressive on other issues. (crosstalk) 

00:50:15
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:50:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It isn't always the case. (crosstalk) 

00:50:15
RITA HARDIMAN Case. 

00:50:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It isn't always the case. (crosstalk) 

00:50:15
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:50:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  So there's, it's not that, it's nirvana here but we're, you're saying that, at least the person has worked through this component to the degree that it naturally habituates back into this, this larger picture of themselves. 

00:50:30
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:50:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And as a result, it in some ways, becomes ah, a resource... (crosstalk) 

00:50:30
RITA HARDIMAN  Yes. 

00:50:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...for the possibility of other changes. 

00:50:35
RITA HARDIMAN Alright. 

00:50:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:50:35
RITA HARDIMAN Alright. That, that's ah, (crosstalk) 

00:50:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. That's where it possible. 

00:50:35
RITA HARDIMAN That's a, ah, ah, a good point that you raised because I'd, I didn't wanna conclude without saying that, uhm, I don't think that people go backwards, but what I do think we do is we continually uncover... (crosstalk) 

00:50:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:50:50
RITA HARDIMAN ...things that we then have to move through each of those stages. So, in your point about, about, ah, one racial group in particular... (crosstalk) 

00:51:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:51:00
RITA HARDIMAN I guess, is very, very true in my experience. I grew up in the northeast of the U.S. I was in my 20's before I met anyone who was American-Indian. 

00:51:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:51:10
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, I had very little contact with Asians. I thought when I was 28 years old... (crosstalk) 

00:51:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:51:15
RITA HARDIMAN ...that, uhm, I was okay. 

00:51:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:51:20
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, I had done a lot of work in the resistance stage around, what I had internalized about Blacks... (crosstalk) 

00:51:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:51:25
RITA HARDIMAN ...and about Hispanics growing up in the northeast. Uhm, it wasn't until I spent some time in the West, ah, of the U.S., out in California, uhm, Colorado, Wyoming where I had much more contact with those other groups... (crosstalk) 

00:51:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:51:40
RITA HARDIMAN ...that all of these things became, ah, were up in front of me again. And I realized that I was still had so much buried in me about the Lone Ranger and Tonto. 

00:51:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:51:50
RITA HARDIMAN You know, about all of that ah, garbage. 

00:51:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:51:55
RITA HARDIMAN Ah. 

00:51:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Either Black men have gone through this with regard to working through our, quote, "racial identity." And then we discovered that we hadn't dealt with, ah, gender issues. (crosstalk) 

00:52:05
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. Right. 

00:52:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uhm, this has come up with Blacks. I work in black studies and, ah, that's the key issue. 

00:52:10
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. (crosstalk) 

00:52:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, that, uhm, we really thought that we, we're progressive and in some ways across the board. 

00:52:15
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:52:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Ah, I don't think we talked about that way but our behaviors suggest that. And it's quite painful for some of, ah, for them to come forth and say, you know, "Do you know who's, who's person in these, these operations and the awards that are being given out and who's always sided?" (crosstalk) 

00:52:30
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:52:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. and so on. 

00:52:30
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:52:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And so on, ah, ah, in the last, ah, five or six years, there's been a concerted effort in the field of African-American studies, to give greater balance to, when, (crosstalk) 

00:52:40
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:52:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. uhm. (crosstalk) 

00:52:40
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:52:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Well, that, that's quite a journey and you'll continue to use this in, uhm, not so much in a clinical way you do it, ah, ah, something that has a strong clinical overtone which is, ah, in training, in industry and so on. But nonetheless, before we jump to what is your primary base of activity around the model, do you have any, a couple of points you might wanna make with regard to people who are working in the clinical field? The application, have you, if you will, at the model? 

00:53:05
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, yes. I, ah, there're a number of things that I've learned about the, about the model and about how to apply it. 

00:53:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:53:15
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, I think Bailey and you perhaps have talked about this as well. I also felt that once I understood the, the process and believe that this is a developmental sequence that what I ought to be about is pushing people through the sequence as quickly as possible. 

00:53:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Sounds okay. 

00:53:35
RITA HARDIMAN So, uhm, I don't know that that's what when we call... (crosstalk) 

00:53:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. How do you, (crosstalk) 

00:53:35
RITA HARDIMAN ...helping or counseling. (crosstalk) 

00:53:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. how do we process that, isn't it? 

00:53:40
RITA HARDIMAN But it's right, how do we (laughs) (coughs) drag people (laughs) (crosstalk) 

00:53:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:53:40
RITA HARDIMAN (laughs) Through all of these stages as quickly as possible, uhm, and realize that that isn't how it works... (crosstalk) 

00:53:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:53:50
RITA HARDIMAN ...that isn't what happens. But I do think that, that, uhm, ah, as an educator, ah, and as a helper, ah, what I know about these stages is that it is important for people to do the work that it, in, at the stage that they are in. (crosstalk) 

00:54:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah, okay. 

00:54:05
RITA HARDIMAN Rather than being prematurely, uhm, ah, pushed through or pulled through by the efforts of a, of an oger, overeager helper. (crosstalk) 

00:54:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. Right. 

00:54:15
RITA HARDIMAN Uhm, and that can be very difficult because it's very difficult to allow someone to, uhm, really talk about the stage, to really talk about where they are in acceptance. 

00:54:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Yeah. 

00:54:30
RITA HARDIMAN We're much more likely to center that because that is all... (crosstalk) 

00:54:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:54:30
RITA HARDIMAN  stuff that we don't wanna hear. 

00:54:35
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:54:35
RITA HARDIMAN But unless an individual is able to talk about what they believe and for the helper to try to introduce some contradictions in what they believe, and there are many, many contradictions... (crosstalk) 

00:54:45
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:54:45
RITA HARDIMAN ...in the, in the acceptance stage in particular. Uhm, it is not going to, uhm, to help the person unless they can, they can, ah, really experience where they are. 

00:54:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:54:55
RITA HARDIMAN And begin to resolve some of those questions. I think it's also helpful. 

00:55:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. So, effectiveness, ah, for a therapist is really learning how to work with people where they're at. 

00:55:05
RITA HARDIMAN Where they're at. 

00:55:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And, and, (crosstalk) 

00:55:05
RITA HARDIMAN And that's I think doing lots of things. (crosstalk) 

00:55:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. and just as league(ph) therapy, uhm, how do you assist them in moving in a certain direction? 

00:55:10
RITA HARDIMAN Yeah. 

00:55:10
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Including the fact that you may not fail to do, be with them when they move at... (crosstalk) 

00:55:15
RITA HARDIMAN Right. 

00:55:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. ...a higher level. 

00:55:15
RITA HARDIMAN Right. I think that, that what we then do is what, ah, all good, good helpers are trained to do which is, is the encouragement, is the nudging, (crosstalk) 

00:55:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yes. 

00:55:25
RITA HARDIMAN is helping people think about taking risks, helping people think through the risk, encouraging them to try out new behavior, ah, to try new things and then being supportive when people try those. 

00:55:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Well. (crosstalk) 

00:55:40
RITA HARDIMAN I think that role modeling is also very critical... (crosstalk) 

00:55:40
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:55:40
RITA HARDIMAN  in this. But if there's one thing that I would say, uhm, to, to, ah, ah, counselors and helpers about this model and, and about Whites in general, White identity in general, it's that, uhm, we need as Whites a place, places... (crosstalk) 

00:56:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Hmm. 

00:56:00
RITA HARDIMAN ...to be able to talk about this. 

00:56:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:56:05
RITA HARDIMAN One of the, the, uhm, the things that keeps, uhm, people stuck and that keeps, I think that keeps, ah, ah, racism alive is that there is a code of silence, ah, about it in the White community. 

00:56:20
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:56:20
RITA HARDIMAN And, uhm, we don't have people who can help us answer, just to answer questions. 

00:56:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. 

00:56:25
RITA HARDIMAN Ah, or resolve feelings or, or, ah, deal with some of our own confusion and some of our own hurts, ah, in, in racially, uhm, difficult situations. And I'm always struck that when I eve, whenever I do training or workshops or teach a class and I talk about this model, I talk about Whiteness, I talk about impacts of racism on Whites, I am literally inundated with people who will come up to me in class after the seminar... (crosstalk) 

00:56:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:56:55
RITA HARDIMAN ...who wanna tell me their story. 

00:56:55
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Right. Hmm, yeah. 

00:56:55
RITA HARDIMAN  And there's a lot of stuff there, and I'm, I'm not their counselor. I'm not their therapist at that point in time. I'm a, I'm a listener. I'm a good listener, I, I hope in those situations. But it really, ah, ah, ah, I'm surprised that, well, maybe I'm not surprised. I just think there's a great need... (crosstalk) 

00:57:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  Yes. 

00:57:20
RITA HARDIMAN ...to, to have someone in, and, in, in different stages that's important than to be a White person. 

00:57:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:57:25
RITA HARDIMAN To be able to talk about some of these with, ah. 

00:57:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:57:30
RITA HARDIMAN And we don't have, we don't have lot of space for that. 

00:57:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Then I'd say it was difficult for us to figure out how to put into a short time, uhm, a cluster of gems and I know we're leaving some out. Uhm, I'm very honored that you, ah, ah, allowed me to participate in the, in the interview. Now, as, ah, there may be some parting statement, ah, some question I didn't ask you or something that comes to mind. What will be your final comment that you wanna make, about your work and... (crosstalk) 

00:57:50
RITA HARDIMAN Ah. 

00:57:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR.  and where things are going? I guess I would like to ask you, are you hopeful? 

00:57:55
RITA HARDIMAN  Ah, yes and no. (laughs) 

00:58:00
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Uh hmm. 

00:58:00
RITA HARDIMAN  And sometimes, it feels like the best of times, the worst of times, (crosstalk) 

00:58:05
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. 

00:58:05
RITA HARDIMAN uhm, but I'm, what I, what I am hopeful about is, uhm, ah, what I see is much more work being done on White identity, much more work done in the counseling field in particular... (crosstalk) 

00:58:15
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Yeah. 

00:58:15
RITA HARDIMAN  on, ah, on a cultural bias, ah, in the counseling field, and that has really grown, I think, in the last 20 years. 

00:58:25
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. And I think your work, uhm, Mark Chester's work, (crosstalk) 

00:58:30
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:58:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. John Dovidio at Colgate, Janet Holmes at University of Maryland. (crosstalk) 

00:58:30
RITA HARDIMAN Uh hmm. 

00:58:30
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. It's real, it's still isn't that, it's still isn't that larger percentage that we would want, but now we can say that there's a critical mass of scholars and, and practitioners who have taken this to a point, they're researching it, they're putting out salient researches turning up and, ah, and professional journals, and it's making a mark, and I wish you the best of luck in the future. 

00:58:50
RITA HARDIMAN Thank you. 

00:58:50
WILLIAM E. CROSS, JR. Okay. (crosstalk) 

00:58:50
