[music] 

00:00:20
BILL O'HANLON I'm Bill O'Hanlon. 

00:00:20
CATHERINE Hi, I'm Catherine. 

00:00:25
BILL O'HANLON We just… we were in another room we just had a discussion about being more who you are. 

00:00:30
CATHERINE Yeah. 

00:00:30
BILL O'HANLON Allow yourself to be who you are and not getting in your way, and not being ashamed and not having to hide who you are and showing up as you are. 

00:00:35
CATHERINE Yeah. 

00:00:40
BILL O'HANLON How in some ways don't you or haven't you and what do you thinks gotten in the way and what have you tried that maybe to and… and how have you gotten more to be yourself as time has gone on if you have. 

00:00:55
CATHERINE Oh, there's some old voices that like to get in the way from my past and like if I make a mistake that's going to be earth shattering. Umm… If I assert myself or ask to have my own needs met I'm going to be shamed, yeah, if I screw up that's it, so it's all over. And I've done a lot of work on that. 

00:01:15
BILL O'HANLON So that's the first thing I guess I'd say is what do you think we could do or what have you done if you've done something in the past that would diminish the power that those voices have had over you at times and when they say can you and, you know, freeze you and stop you and they've stopped you? What do you think, I mean, that's one idea you could record a (inaudible) mindful as you could do that, but any other ideas or any other things that have worked or any other things that we can get them so they're not so influential at the… at the time (inaudible)? 

00:01:55
CATHERINE Oh, it's been very helpful to see them as not me, not my true self. 

00:02:00
BILL O'HANLON Oh, okay. 

00:02:00
CATHERINE So I've been able to make a separation. 

00:02:00
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, so instead of my voices or I'm telling myself it's the voices. 

00:02:05
CATHERINE Yeah. 

00:02:10
BILL O'HANLON So that's… It's kind of a verbal separation that you can do is like "That's not me, that's some overlay on who I truly Am." 

00:02:15
CATHERINE Yeah, it's an intrusion. 

00:02:15
BILL O'HANLON So how else could we make sure that… that during those moments when the toughest moments when the self-criticism or the criticism show up, the voices show up what else could we do to create a little more distance on object like she did with the tapes. Little more objectivity anything else come to mind? 

00:02:35
CATHERINE I can feel sometimes I can put a physical distance, a sense of those voices are over there and I'm over here and I push them out further… push him out further. But I've gotten stuck at some point so I can't dispel it all the way and I'm… I still feel horrible. 

00:02:55
BILL O'HANLON So it's still in the field somewhere a little better when they're a little more distance, you know. 

00:03:00
CATHERINE Yeah, I can it's like I can feel myself a bit, you know, it's like "Okay, wait one foot in my real self and other foot lost out here," yeah. 

00:03:10
BILL O'HANLON Years ago I was in a mental… I worked in mental health center and I had a colleague and one time we went out to lunch. So this was years ago, this is in the 80s sometime late 70s or early 80s. And he was talking about working with clients and he said "You know, when people are traumatized when they have some trauma memory that's haunting them here's what I do." I have them remember the memory, but changed in some way like I have that if there were other people involved I have… I have them imagine that they all just took a hit of helium and they're speaking with Mickey Mouse voices and I'm like "Why?" You know and he's telling me this and I'm like "Why?" (inaudible) that work, he goes "Yeah, it works." They come back the next time and they say "The memories totally changed, it doesn't haunt me anymore and I'm like from thinking about (inaudible) you know, Mickey Mouse and then he said "Yeah." and sometimes I have imagined everybody in the situation has like Smurf faces, they're all purple or blue, you know, so I said "That working?" He goes "Yeah, that works too." And he goes "Sometimes I have them look at the situation as if it's the wrong end of a telescope as very (inaudible) that's what reminded me when the voices sort of went way… went far away, so, you know, years later when I was working a lot more on trauma and thinking about trauma I thought "Well, you know, what is trauma but that kind of looping of a certain kind of experience again and again" You know, it just like, you know, YouTube stuck in a moment. There's a moment that got stuck in you, a moment in your earlier life and then where some voices came or other people's voices got incorporated or whatever, it wasn't you, it overlaid on top of you. Anything like that you and I could brainstorm and think of together that when those voices if they show up in the future, when they show up if they do, you could do some Smurf like, you know, helium like, you know, wrong end of the telescope and maybe auditory, I don't know, you know, again you have music in your lives in some way so, you know, you can speed it up, you can slow it down, you could umm… change the frequency, I don't know what, you know, I don't know what, but anything like that you could think of them and anything that might appeal? 

00:05:25
CATHERINE Yeah, turning it… turning them into something ridiculous that might help, you know, in some weird cartoon character maybe. 

00:05:35
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, like what cartoon carry like Elmer Fudd or something or like that's a good one what else, yeah, what else. Think… let's think of some other ones? Most ridiculous Beavis and Butt-Head… 

00:05:50
CATHERINE Oh, that went… 

00:05:50
BILL O'HANLON I'm carbon dating myself here some of you don't know who that is. 

00:05:50
CATHERINE I do. 

00:05:55
BILL O'HANLON You do. Okay, Beavis and Butt-Head… Yeah, you gotta get the laugh right… you gotta get the laugh right. And I'd (inaudible) that I have to go back and watch it (inaudible) Beavis and Butt-Head… 

00:06:05
CATHERINE I hate Beavis. 

00:06:10
BILL O'HANLON What? 

00:06:10
CATHERINE I hate Beavis. 

00:06:10
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, that's right. That's good. (inaudible) watch that and come practice that one, that's a good one. Any… and other cartoon characters that you can think of just I haven't reserved because we want to have a great… 

00:06:20
CATHERINE Yeah, we need… 

00:06:20
BILL O'HANLON Arsenal to, you know, like dissipate this stuff. 

00:06:25
CATHERINE Eric Cartman from South Park. 

00:06:30
BILL O'HANLON Eric Cartman! Eric Cartman, perfect. 

00:06:35
CATHERINE (inaudible) why he's like (inaudible). 

00:06:35
BILL O'HANLON It's good, I like that okay. So here's what I would do if I were going to do that. I would watch those and just like practice while I was watching South Park or get some all Beavis and Butt-Head stuff on YouTube or something and I would practice that, you know, go look at Elmer Fudd because you might want to try that oh, that a reserve that's the hard one I think Elmer Fudd. Umm… 

00:06:55
CATHERINE I'm hunting rabbits. 

00:06:55
BILL O'HANLON You're hunting rabbits that's it… that's it. yeah, so and then think of the typical kind of phrases like that person did with it was doing anorexia and think "Okay, so practice them in those… in those, you know, accents if you will? 

00:07:15
CATHERINE That's already… that already feels fine. 

00:07:15
BILL O'HANLON Good. I'm turning trauma in the fun yes (inaudible) yes that's the idea. So okay, so that's good. So umm… again let's sort a revisit this a little and you've made some progress on this on your own with things you've tried and you've been, you know, therapy in self-development you know a lot of stuff. So tell me what's worked, you know, because you made some distance it's not like it was before and you're not totally paralyzed by it and a lot of times it doesn't stop you and a lot of times the voices maybe don't even show up. So what do you thinks helped? 

00:07:50
CATHERINE (inaudible) I've been practicing this for years, you know, because voices go back from childhood of course. 

00:08:00
BILL O'HANLON Right. 

00:08:00
CATHERINE (inaudible) for years so there's been different stuff spiritual things that I practice umm… and then supportive people. Yeah, they are like (inaudible) that are really supportive. And there are people that really think the world of me. 

00:08:20
BILL O'HANLON Yes. 

00:08:20
CATHERINE You know, and sometimes that helps… Most of the time that helps me make reconnect. 

00:08:25
BILL O'HANLON So when… when you feel their presence, it's a counter to that stuff. 

00:08:30
CATHERINE It… it is, but sometimes… sometimes the challenge gets such that I'm aware of it and I can see them in my mind so I could feel their presence where its like too far away. 

00:08:40
BILL O'HANLON They are distant too, yeah. 

00:08:40
CATHERINE Yeah, it's like… 

00:08:40
BILL O'HANLON So what could bring them… what could bring them closer in that moment if anything occurred? 

00:08:45
CATHERINE I don't know yet. (inaudible) I have a sense that I can draw them closer I just don't know it's like as… as if they are as far away as the… the dark voices are and I'm somewhere in the center of that. It's very nasty place. 

00:09:00
BILL O'HANLON So, you know, again I worked at a mental health center and one of the mental health centers I worked, they told us "You can't bring religion and spirituality in your sessions." Because we don't want to impose, you know, our ideas on people and here I am. You know, I've got a lot of spiritual stuff going for me and I think it's a great resource for people (inaudible) you know, that's frustrating. One time I'm doing hypnosis as a person and she gets really frighten and I say "Okay, you know, Oops! Like I dropped it for a second… She gets really frightening and she's in trance she said "I'm really… really scared." And I said "Well, could you imagine anyone coming in this room that you really you feel is on your side and takes the world (inaudible) you and is your support and putting his or her hand on your shoulder just says reassurance (inaudible)." She goes "Yeah." I said "Who is that?" She goes "Jesus." I'm looking around my supervisors (inaudible) bring it… bring it, you know, come up bring in him and he touched her shoulder and she just like "I'm okay now." 

00:10:00
CATHERINE Wow! 

00:10:05
BILL O'HANLON You know, I didn't say "Bring Jesus and bring Buddha in or whoever," you know, that was her idea. So they're out there your supporters how about if we bring him around back and have him just touch your shoulder during those moments. Because then the voices are far away and not that support isn't far away, they're behind you and there I don't know how they touch you, you know, they might be giving you a massage like friends do sometimes. They come up behind you or they may put a hand on shoulder, they might touch your face or something that you would find connective and comforting that would help you actually connect with that the people who think the world of you rather than they seem just (inaudible) what do you think that might be, you know, you may not know you might have to try it, but what's your idea of what might be the best for them. 

00:10:50
CATHERINE Well, coming up behind feels helpful. Because I've been trying to draw them toward from in front of me I can't do it and I can't. But there's something about them coming from behind that feels easier. There's something easier about that. 

00:11:05
BILL O'HANLON It's nice because you've been trying to pull them forward from there… 

00:11:10
CATHERINE Like they are there and say come here… 

00:11:15
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, come on I need your… 

00:11:15
CATHERINE Help me. 

00:11:15
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, right. But having them behind it's like, you know, I got your back. 

00:11:20
CATHERINE Yes. 

00:11:20
BILL O'HANLON Cool. 

00:11:20
CATHERINE Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to me. 

00:11:20
BILL O'HANLON Cool… cool. 

00:11:25
CATHERINE Mm-hmm. 

00:11:25
BILL O'HANLON Okay, so anything else we need to talk about or we (inaudible) you. 

00:11:30
CATHERINE Well, it would be really great to feel it a deeper level. I mean, I could almost feel them coming. 

00:11:40
BILL O'HANLON Yeah! 

00:11:40
CATHERINE You know, right behind me. 

00:11:40
BILL O'HANLON So can you try it now, you know, I don't know if you can sort of bring in, you know, think of a situation in which you feel shamed or criticize or stopped or, you know, and then do one of those things or… or several of those things, you know, the cartoon character thing maybe try the I've got your back thing first," that might be easiest. 

00:12:00
CATHERINE Yeah… yeah, I can feel that right now (inaudible) that good. 

00:12:05
BILL O'HANLON That's nice. 

00:12:10
CATHERINE Yeah. 

00:12:10
BILL O'HANLON So if you've got that even if you can't totally get the critical voices, it might be a nice practice resource. 

00:12:15
CATHERINE Yeah, because I can get them closer and then I can feel myself that's the other part of it. 

00:12:25
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, when they connect with you, you can connect with yourself. 

00:12:25
CATHERINE Yeah, like it helps me a little feel that. And it's that's it's my own personal power and I won't be able to feel that more. There's been some times where I've been really in touch with (inaudible) really be present fully and I can just and that's lots of love for me. If I'm feeling free and not scared then it comes out just a lot of like huge love for in joy, lot of aliveness you know and I want that and things. One of those things get out of my way (inaudible) things you trip over. But I have my… If I can have that back-up "Oh, that's a nice shift already." 

00:13:10
BILL O'HANLON It's nice. 

00:13:10
CATHERINE Because I feel them behind me, even if they can't get super close, yet somehow it's better than them being in front, you know, that feels a lot better… 

00:13:20
BILL O'HANLON That's nice. You know, I… I've been staying with my friend Steve Gilligan who lives nearby and I've been driving back and forth, and I have to my phone is always like I have an iPhone 6s and its always going like dead, batteries drain, so I have to plug it in that in the car and because I'm using the GPS to get directions here and then my music starts to play automatically and I can't figure out how to turn it off and… and, you know, it's not that far drives so the same six songs have been playing every time I go back and forth. And the last one right before I get here it's a Sheryl Crow song "Always on your side," it's such a beautiful listening I don't know if you know that song but, you know, it's just such a great song, its talking about a breakup or she's breaking up with somebody she loved, you know, even though we're not together, I'm always on your side and I was always on your side, you know, and I just "Oh, that moves me to tears," so I hear that so, you know, I just recommend you have that has one of your theme songs for the next little while, you know, I'm behind you, I've got your back, umm… you know, and I'm always on your side. 

00:14:25
CATHERINE Oh, yeah. I can't remember the artist's name, but reminds me of a similar song from the 80s (inaudible) sings "I am by your side In this truth you can (inaudible) you can always count on me. I will never hide you see." 

00:14:45
BILL O'HANLON So maybe go find that so. 

00:14:45
CATHERINE Yeah, I got it find that already. 

00:14:45
BILL O'HANLON That song that would be nice. 

00:14:45
CATHERINE Because I came right up. 

00:14:50
BILL O'HANLON I think it will be nice to have a theme song for this change because to remind you again, that could be good. 

00:14:55
CATHERINE Yeah …yeah, that feels better already… 

00:14:55
BILL O'HANLON Good. 

00:15:00
CATHERINE I don't think I'd get this (inaudible) this is your hard stuck voice I thought. 

00:15:05
BILL O'HANLON Yeah! 

00:15:05
CATHERINE Oh, boy! We're gonna give this a shot (inaudible). 

00:15:05
BILL O'HANLON That's why we call it brief therapy. As opposed to briefs therapy which is, you know, about your underwear and that would be a little awkward for all. So umm… okay, so I can't help that's my (inaudible). 

00:15:25
CATHERINE No… no, that's all good. 

00:15:25
BILL O'HANLON Umm… So any other things we should talk about umm… before we… I'm going to actually ask if anybody in the peak hour has questions or comments if you're willing to stay up here… 

00:15:35
CATHERINE Oh, sure. 

00:15:35
BILL O'HANLON But before that anything else we need to do to come to a sense of completion? 

00:15:40
CATHERINE When I feel myself, you know, because I want to be closer to this feeling and call it forth umm… when I'm really hear all the way in which I am right now umm… even though there's all these people (inaudible) here it's great. 

00:15:55
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:16:00
CATHERINE Umm… Feels like the light comes from the center here, there's like this beautiful light shines like a diamond out of my heart and that's like that's when I can feel my own beauty, you know, it's like this is me, this is who I am, I've got so much to… to share and experience other people is let them be touched with my light and feel their it's like a connection between that the true light. And if I could have a way of being able to access that more, yes, my backup will help me. But I feel like there's another step I could take this (inaudible) just I don't see it yet, I feel it yet, but I feel it coming. (inaudible) if there's something if you got something that helped that metaphor go for me that sense, you know. 

00:16:50
BILL O'HANLON Two more theme songs. I mean, the Pink Floyd, "Shine On You Crazy Diamond." 

00:16:50
CATHERINE That's my favorite Pink Floyd song. 

00:16:55
BILL O'HANLON There you got it's a great song. And then I have this obscure singer-songwriter that I love. He is the most creative songwriter I know. He's just incredibly creative and he has a song called "Let the line in… Let the light in… let the light in. 

00:17:10
CATHERINE Yeah. 

00:17:10
BILL O'HANLON It's amazing and it's a story about the wicked witch who's tired of making everybody feel bad, decides to take a break in Cleveland for the weekend and the Tin-Man and the lion walk into the same bar and thus witch stands up and the lion runs for cover, of course but the Tin Man goes forward and they fall in love. And nobody thinks they're pretty pair, but love doesn't give a damn what other people say. It's always been that way and it will always be that way forever and ever Amen. Let the light in… let the light in… let the light in. It's a beautiful songs so I recommend you go find Bob Schneider, it's that one. Let's see what else might be helpful if anything else. I… I think you're on your way and I don't think you need the next step. I think when we do… when you do the first step, the second thing will start off will emerge more. Uh… That's my sense, but I don't know for sure but that's my sense. Umm… So I'm not worried about it. 

00:18:10
CATHERINE Oh, thank you… thank you. Yeah, (inaudible) so feels good. 

00:18:15
BILL O'HANLON Thank you, And I guess the other thing I would say and, you know, you said (inaudible) you know, all these people and, you know, you're speaking about things that are kind of could be shameful or embarrassing or you know, private things or whatever, you did that and that to me is a step saying, you know, voices you don't have the power over me and I'm standing up for my own power and get (inaudible) crazy diamond shine through here in front of all these people and… 

00:18:35
CATHERINE Who all have my back? 

00:18:35
BILL O'HANLON They all got you. They got you back. 

00:18:40
CATHERINE I see oh, yeah. 

00:18:40
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, and, you know, that sense of you standing for yourself too, you know, that you… you came up to me and you said "Hey, do you have a demonstrate." And you know, you did that thing and, you know, you said magic, you know like she is (inaudible) Magic! You know, this gonna happen, you know, you… you envisioned it, you decided you wanted to do it, you ask and it happened, you know, so you did that, you're crazy diamond just came out and, you know, spoke for yourself. 

00:19:10
CATHERINE Oh, I like that. 

00:19:10
BILL O'HANLON That's good… 

00:19:10
CATHERINE I'm a crazy diamond. 

00:19:10
BILL O'HANLON Crazy diamond shining… 

00:19:15
CATHERINE Oh, I'll take that one crazy diamond that's me. I like that. 

00:19:15
BILL O'HANLON That's it? 

00:19:20
CATHERINE That… that feels good. 

00:19:20
BILL O'HANLON Cool! All right, so let's find out whether anybody from the peanut gallery has a comment or a question, and if you do, you have to come to the microphone because it's such a big room and won't be able to hear you in the back and we might not be able to hear you, so if you have a question or comment for either of us? Yeah, come on, pal. You don't have to run. Well, where are we? Where are we? 

00:19:50
CATHERINE We're children out now, we're good. 

00:19:50
UNKNOWN We're supposed to have brief therapy so… 

00:19:50
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, well… 

00:19:55
UNKNOWN So it's be fast so… 

00:19:55
BILL O'HANLON So make it a brief question. 

00:19:55
UNKNOWN (inaudible) gonna be brief. 

00:19:55
BILL O'HANLON All right, pal. 

00:19:55
UNKNOWN I noticed the pattern you've done today, but I've seen otherwise is when you gave the… the story of the colleague and the helium and all that and you… you weren't was not directive, but where you kind of hoping whether or not she said "Yeah, I can try that or it worked for me," that… that may be just by putting it out there she was all the manically having to… to experience it. 

00:20:25
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, a little I guess, but I think of it more like a smorgasbord, unlike laying out these possibilities and she's coming along (inaudible) "Oh, yeah, I want that dish," No, (inaudible) that doesn't appeal to me at this stage and hopefully the smorgasbord (inaudible) there's something that you'll like (inaudible) that the ticket, you know, and that, you know, we talked about a lot of things but all of a sudden the person behind you really resonated (inaudible) the other things were fine and they were clever and good maybe, but, you know, and they may help, but that one experientially I could tell it's like "Yeah, I want that dish." And the crazy (inaudible) "I want that dish." So it's that it's more of an invitation and obviously to… to imagine it, you're sort of doing it a little maybe, but I don't think of it like that. It's more like here's a bunch of possibilities and that's what I love about stories because stories are not do this they're like here's what someone did, he's my friend Joe, you know, here's what someone did this appeal to you as one of your things to do or if it doesn't appeal to you is there any variation on that or anything that… that reminds you off that you've either done or could do, that's how I think of it much more than I'm indirectly getting her to do it. But I suppose anytime you tell a story you're imagining the thing and sort of following along and doing it, but some things, you know, like some people tell stories like "Oh, yeah, that doesn't really." I don't get involved in that story. It doesn't grab. And so yeah, (inaudible) way more strategic than I am I think that… that idea, I'm not that clever. Any other observations or questions, what did you notice? What curiosities do you have? Or questions for Catherine for Bill? Or comments for either us? 

00:22:20
UNKNOWN I really enjoyed how open you were and how you engage to her so well and I found myself wanting to ask "Can you sing the whole song." 

00:22:35
CATHERINE Oh, (inaudible). 

00:22:35
BILL O'HANLON (inaudible) you're shining… 

00:22:35
UNKNOWN You have a nice voice, thank you. 

00:22:40
CATHERINE Oh! 

00:22:40
BILL O'HANLON Can you sing that (inaudible) I think that wasn't just a curiosity question… 

00:22:45
CATHERINE He really wanted me to sing. 

00:22:45

00:22:50
CATHERINE I would need the… I need… 

00:22:50
BILL O'HANLON (inaudible). 

00:22:50
CATHERINE I would need the rest of the lyrics, but I'll sing what I know again.

BILL O'HANLON Yeah… yeah… yeah. 

00:22:55
CATHERINE You know, I've got what I've got let me see.

00:23:00
CATHERINE I am by your side in this truth you can confine. You can always count on me. I will never hide you see… I am by your side. You can count on me I am by your side. 

00:23:25
BILL O'HANLON Right! That's so probably go find those rest of the lyrics (inaudible) nice, I mean, nice little theme song that will be cool. 

00:23:30
CATHERINE Thank you. 

00:23:30
BILL O'HANLON Theme songs… 

00:23:35
CATHERINE Shine On You Crazy Diamond. 

00:23:35
BILL O'HANLON Shine! 

00:23:35
CATHERINE Shine on you crazy diamond… 

00:23:40
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, that's right. You need that… 

00:23:40
CATHERINE You were caught on the crossfire something whatever blown on the steel breeze if you know. Come on you weaver far away… We're gonna have a dance session. 

00:23:55
BILL O'HANLON Dreamer yeah, you know, that great. 

00:23:55
CATHERINE Now we shall have a jazz session, okay. 

00:23:55
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, that's right. We got… I gotta learn that… 

00:24:00
CATHERINE Oh, yeah. 

00:24:00
BILL O'HANLON All right. We got another question or comments. Thanks, yeah. (inaudible) it up a little thanks. 

00:24:05
UNKNOWN So I noticed that your stories today were about how somebody else solved this problem. Is that typically what you do or… 

00:24:15
BILL O'HANLON Problem somebody else found a solution. This one appeal to you problem. I'll tell you a story about that and that is I had a client that was quite troubled and every once in a while when she was super trouble in this session I think probably in her life, but I didn't… I didn't witness it there. She would just like regressed to infancy. She curl up in the chair and just, you know, like… like she just had to defend herself and the world she was just and she would kind of get into this fetal position and I'd be doing therapy and I've been doing my usual thing which is usually that and, you know, in addition to other things and everyone smile she just something I was doing, I imagined was triggering that. And so after awhile I got the pattern is and so I said "I have an idea that when I tell stories, it triggers…" It's a few minutes after, but it triggers this thing she goes and then she thought about it and she said "Yeah, I think you're right because all those stories are someone who had a problem and resolved it. And I'm afraid I'm gonna let you down as a client because I'm not doing that and so I won't be a good client, you know." So I said "Yeah, okay, I got it." And I started tell her stories about people who didn't change and when I didn't change when I had a problem. And she's like sit not. So but I… I didn't know that was my structure until that happened, but it's almost always a problem successful resolution, somebody was a hero and their story and made a change, and it's a model or it stimulates an association even if that's not the solution, they think "Oh, I don't want to do this, but I could do this" and so yeah that's almost always the structure I notice. Thanks, good observation. I took me years to notice that… You got in a couple of minutes, that's annoying. All right other observations or questions, Maria please come to the mike, thanks. You're gonna have to turn it down a little closer, a little shorter than the last person. 

00:26:25
[sil.] 

00:26:35
MARIA There… there was one thing that got my attention and (inaudible) had to do with the way the two of you were moving? 

00:26:45
BILL O'HANLON Yes. 

00:26:45
MARIA You were moving a lot with your hands and your legs and I think that made it very nice that… that it was a very kinesthetic interaction and I think that the combination of your movement and your singing was absolutely beautiful. I just wanted to… 

00:27:00
BILL O'HANLON We were dancing and singing up here a song and dance routine we got gone. Uh… I didn't notice that, but thank you… 

00:27:05
MARIA Because I like music and probably that was the reason I was so focused on that which made it very nice. I have phone I will take. 

00:27:15
BILL O'HANLON That's (inaudible). 

00:27:15
CATHERINE Thank you. 

00:27:15
BILL O'HANLON Great observation. I didn't… I didn't notice. I just thought I was kinda restless (inaudible) but that's nice. 

00:27:25
CATHERINE Oh, that's okay, me too. I was like. 

00:27:25
MARIA It was nice. 

00:27:25
BILL O'HANLON Thank you okay. 

00:27:30
CATHERINE Thank you very much. 

00:27:30
UNKNOWN Maybe it's already been said, but I just wanted to umm… emphasize I guess that this is a great example of how umm… therapy can be very friendly and very conversational and in a sense light when it's very deep at the same time. And especially I guess when there might be trauma or other things around it's very useful to be able to do effective work and stay in a light level without trivializing anything and I think you do a good job of that. 

00:28:00
BILL O'HANLON Thank you… thank you… thank you for that, yeah. 

00:28:00
CATHERINE Yes. 

00:28:05
BILL O'HANLON Erickson once said to me, people come into therapy griming of as it is. We don't need to add to the grimness lighten up a little. And so, you know, I've… I've, you know, I like humor a bit and so that always nice. And I do like lightness, you know, I'm, you know, what we were just talking about in the last session, you know, I'm all screwed up, you're all screwed up, welcome to the world and we're okay, anyway even if we're all screwed up. And that's okay with me and we don't want to take it that grimly. You know, I take it seriously even not grimly and light is fun to me and music is (inaudible) and we do share that because we've shared musical things in the past so that seemed to come out as a bit of a theme so. Well, cartoons I didn't know we were gonna go there… 

00:28:45
CATHERINE Yeah, that was fun. 

00:28:50
BILL O'HANLON That was fun. (inaudible) yeah. 

00:28:50
CATHERINE I felt better already just thinking about that. 

00:28:50
BILL O'HANLON It's likely about that. All right. 

00:28:55
CATHERINE Yeah, for… for… for my perspective umm… kind of what Larry was saying. I was so relieved and like "Oh, boy! I don't have to go into it." I can just say that this is what's here and this is what, you know, I'm trying to here's what I want, here's what I'm trying to transform. And I didn't have to open it and didn't have to umm… feel all upset and heavier anything. It was, yeah, that… that was nice. That was really good, the lightness… 

00:29:25
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, and if you've gone there it would have been okay with me, but yeah, I didn't think that was necessary. 

00:29:30
CATHERINE You know, you didn't… you didn't like ask me to so that… that was great. It was like… 

00:29:30
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:29:35
CATHERINE Because I knew I couldn't go there without going all the way there. Umm… The other part that was really cool is that I felt an assumption you're like "Well, okay and (inaudible) already tried this not, you know, what do you think you did with this here you go what do you think you can do. And I'm like No! This guy is (inaudible) I'm receiving a (inaudible) you've got it, you can do this. You didn't do this, you know, so what if you don't do it right away you can do. 

00:30:00
BILL O'HANLON Yeah… yeah. 

00:30:00
CATHERINE So there's an assumption that I'd be competent… 

00:30:00
BILL O'HANLON That's interesting you said because I do have that sense is like, you know, you're… you're like "Oh, what do I do about this?" (inaudible) I think you got that, you know, you've got this is that since, you know, and I do have… Well, I have this sense about you because I know you're little and but I do have I think general idea about that. Yeah, that's my general philosophy, you know, and I… I once went EMDR training and they spent the first morning telling me and everybody else in the room, how fragile people were and how you can mess them up if you didn't go to this training and learn the right stuff and I was offended by that, you know, I… I generally think people are pretty resilient and have resources and can do amazing things. If you expect that of them and if you don't you think they're fragile mental patients that's probably how they'll show up too, so, you know, I… I don't love that yeah, I don't love that philosophy and I like that philosophy of you're a cool person and competent and, you know, and right now struggling with this, you know, you were struggling with that and that's that. It's just, you know, that's the way it is. 

00:31:05
CATHERINE And that helped because they had a sense of "Oh, boy! I can't get pass this point. I can't… I can't. Yeah, and I heard like "Oh, yeah, you can even if neither one of us knows how yet. 

00:31:10
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:31:15
CATHERINE Yeah, you can and that was a big deal. 

00:31:15
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, and that's, you know, again we (inaudible) last session. Oh! That's me or you or… that's me I think. I just moved… It's not you, it's me. 

00:31:35
CATHERINE Oh, thank you so much. 

00:31:35
BILL O'HANLON I got to strike (inaudible) are saying, but it was really crucial point I'm sorry that… 

00:31:40
CATHERINE Oh, no. 

00:31:40
BILL O'HANLON It's all loss now to the presentation but… 

00:31:45
CATHERINE Oh, it was more. It was just more that you can do it thing. 

00:31:45
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:31:45
CATHERINE And I'm like I can't… I can't. And you're kind of like "Yeah, you can… yeah, you can do it… 

00:31:50
BILL O'HANLON And you sort of are already doing it, but yeah, I think we already moved you a little pass that point and then I think it can continue… 

00:31:55
CATHERINE It kept going. 

00:31:55
BILL O'HANLON Yeah, so I do think that. So umm… so I think that's enough for… 

00:32:00
CATHERINE Yeah, thank you. 

00:32:00
BILL O'HANLON That's okay, thanks. 

00:32:05
CATHERINE Thank you. 

00:32:05
BILL O'HANLON all right, thanks. You can go and take that… 

00:32:10
CATHERINE (inaudible) thanks a lot. 

00:32:10
BILL O'HANLON So uh… what are we supposed to stop at 04:15? 

00:32:15
UNKNOWN I think. 

00:32:15
BILL O'HANLON Let's do another one. Are you got other question, go ahead? Oh, you wanted… Okay, yeah, come on. Sorry, oh! And so I thought they had a question, sorry. So go over there and get hooked up. So while they're getting the microphone things is there anything that surprised you about that… that… that wasn't what you expected was using stories and brief therapy? Or (inaudible) about what you thought that's what this will be or is. Yeah. I'll repeat this. You confirm my opinion that therapy can be fun and should be fun. Thank you. Yes, okay, anything else you can just shout it out. I'll repeat it so you don't have to go to the mike. Yeah… yeah I did a little of that, but I didn't hear too much in that so I just brought them. But usually when we go a little logger there… there's a lot more exchange of stories. And then if I do trance which I didn't do here particularly, I incorporate some of those stories (inaudible) some of the themes of those stories in the trance. Maria! Cartoons in therapy. What did you like about using cartoons in therapy? 

00:33:45
[sil.] 

00:34:15
BILL O'HANLON Uh… No, I don't remember crazy car racer you remember that Cartoon 

00:34:20
[sil.] 

00:34:35
BILL O'HANLON Twins hitting each other. Yeah, there are different characters in the race. 

00:34:40
UNKNOWN (inaudible). 

00:34:45
BILL O'HANLON Humor, yeah. Well, cartoons hopefully brings a little silliness to all thing. We were trying to do that, lightening up a little, so it wasn't so grim and… and, you know, and really I did learn that from my colleague at the Mental Health Center I was like "That works for (inaudible) like having people, you know, inhale helium, I just couldn't imagine and years later I thought "Well, it's pattern intervention," you know, its sub modality change for those of you who are in NLP. Okay, Ben, lets we only got a couple of minutes curious so go… 

00:35:10
BEN All right, (inaudible) try to say it real fast. 

00:35:15
BILL O'HANLON All right 

00:35:15
BEN I'm someone who hasn't created anything in a while and that's bothering me. Because I am someone (inaudible) creative for example… 

00:35:20
BILL O'HANLON You used to do a lot of creative stuff, yeah. 

00:35:25
BEN Yeah, well, if you know the Mac versus PC ad. Umm… In 1999, Philip Schiller's deputy. Philip Schiller being Apple's VP Marketing, I came up to… I came up to and presented uh… you know, here's something you might want to try and in fact she used the gay couples counseling ads, so if you look up just get language patterns I got absolutely no credit for it, it's nothing of it, but I can talk about here in the conferences… 

00:35:50
BILL O'HANLON You came up for that. 

00:35:55
BEN Yeah, you know, I (inaudible) with long period ago two decades ago I helped drive the nation's first publicly funded HIV disease, I mean, needle exchange of the nation's first (inaudible) needle exchange was in Santa Clara County I was chief steward I drove that. And I'm getting in my own way with any new ideas because any new idea seems like my own ego, it doesn't seem like for other people so I can drive things and I think I'm doing something for someone else. 

00:36:25
BILL O'HANLON Uh-huh. 

00:36:25
BEN But I think what I'm screwing with myself on is somehow if I write anything now or to anything now or initiating anything now it's about me and it's not about helping anyone else. 

00:36:35
BILL O'HANLON All right, so let me tell you a story. 

00:36:40
BEN Okay, please. 

00:36:40
BILL O'HANLON That's what we're here for, right? 

00:36:40
BEN Yes. 

00:36:40
BILL O'HANLON And to help you hopefully. Umm… So, you know, when I was younger I… I used to play music and I used play out (inaudible) and stuff and… and I was very shy, but when I started playing music, it was the only time I could talk in front of a group because people would like to music and then after two or three songs when I could get they were into it, I could say something between signs which was extraordinary to me. Because I never talked in groups, I… I was absolutely… I never talked in groups. If I had a one-on-one friend I can talk, you know, and I was fine, but shy in public and so I came to this place where I was becoming therapist and I could have been a musician. And I had this interesting that you said is this process. Well, becoming therapist is about helping other people, music is all about me and my self-expression and it's selfish. Now years later, I thought about this in a different way because a few years before that I had first started college and maybe you've heard it or a few people of heard (inaudible) I became depressed and suicidal when I was first in college. I was very (inaudible) and very shy, but I was also very isolated and I had an album that a friend of mine who worked at the college radio station they get free albums all the time he said "We're not gonna play this one you wanted. (inaudible) Sure. And it was an alum by a woman named Essra Mohawk, E.S.S.R.A, a terrific singer-songwriter and stunningly good. Never made it, but she's like, you know, James Taylor and she's so great, so (inaudible) you know, Joni Mitchell, you know, Carol King she's it for me. She's in that pantheon, so I listened to that album obsessively. You know, I spent a lot of time alone in… in my dorm room and I listened to it and it was an turntable days and there was a phrase after awhile because I was so desperately lonely and unhappy, and I would pick up that needle and I knew exactly where to lay it down on the record and the phrase was "Let me reassure so that someone loves you. Let me reassure you so that someone knows." Pick it up again "Let me reassure so that someone," and I would play it again and again it like were those grooves down, you know, I wrecked the album actually, but I later I got on CD just a couple of years go and… and so I'm thinking back on this later and I thought I made that choice to become a therapist and ultimately a writer and a speaker, and I didn't become a musician because I had that mindset and I thought that woman saved my life. Actually she had a website later I found her, you know, maybe 10 years ago and I wrote… There was a place you could write as for on the… I wrote her I said I told her that story and I said "You essentially saved my life." She never wrote back. I would right back to someone (inaudible) I didn't expect her to say "We're best friends now and let's hang out," but, you know, I'd be nice like "Thank you for sending me the story that was really great," you know, she's like unknown now for the most part and here's one of her biggest fan is telling you "You saved my… you literally saved my life with music" that thing I thought was selfish. Music has saved my life that time but, you know, it's been such a pervasive joy in my life and contribution to my life. So here I am thinking it's all about me if I do music and it's all about them if I do that. I think you're probably wrong is what I'm telling you. That's a validation technique in brief therapy. I think… I think you got it all wrong that's what I think that whatever that thing is, I mean, that you think you're blocking whatever else might come through that channel that might be like the Apple ad and the needle exchange stuff, you know, once you open that, you know, because you know (inaudible) creative ideas it's not like you get one and you never get an another one. You get one and you get another one and you get another one, and then you have to figure out which ones to go forward on and how to get them into the world that's a different matter, but I really it's like, it doesn't matter if it's all about you, it doesn't matter if it's selfish, it doesn't matter if it's not therapy or social, you know, contribution stuff. It's really about, you know, I came across this quote awhile ago from religious writer and he said, you know, "The idea is to figure out what brings you alive and go do that because what the world needs is more people have come alive. Just not go out and figure out what the world needs, you come alive and when you come alive, then the world will tell you what to do with that aliveness." So, you know, if you accepted my premise that you're wrong and I'm right umm… no, that (inaudible) umm… that you had this sort of mistakenly put in those categories like I did. What would help you get to that place where you actually could open those… those spigots of creativity again you think or has this helped a little already? 

00:42:00
BEN Well, seeing almost anything that… that is useful even… for me. 

00:42:05
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:42:05
BEN This probably gonna be useful to someone else. 

00:42:10
BILL O'HANLON Good, so that might help a bit. Yeah, and you think that would open those spigots a little and… 

00:42:15
BEN Feeling like I had, you know, I… I did one of the things that sort of open the spigot is even got me to come up here is like, you know, there's a contribution I'm supposed to make and as I'm not sure… 

00:42:25
BILL O'HANLON You're not sure what it is (inaudible) and you can't find it until that creative thing comes to you. 

00:42:30
BEN Yeah. 

00:42:30
BILL O'HANLON So, yeah. Okay, so that's… that's a… that's a good question so let me bring you back to those earlier days when this wasn't such a dilemma or when you were doing it for other people and it was clearly for them. How did creative ideas show up when did they, you know, in the middle of the night or you know, while you're taking a shower, while you're walking or they just showed up randomly during a day or a bunch of different ways? 

00:42:55
BEN One of them was just like I think I was sitting on my Mac and in the middle of night and (inaudible) I was trying to explain to a friend, you know, I think it was like 1998 or something why would you buy a Mac in 1998, you know, as like "Well, let me tell you?" And that's when the idea came up right. 

00:43:10
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:43:15
BEN And there was a… there was a friend one of mine came to me… The Needle Exchange came to me when, you know, we had some volunteers going out that I was representing who were actually, you know, risking their lives and basically not even get paid just hang out the needles and that was the thought was, you know, "Hey, we need to… we need to get these guys coverage, right? They all… If they get killed or something or they're out they're handing out the clean needles that are not covered by any insurance or any workers… Anything. Uh… Plus then the public… They were taking the dirty needles where there was a whole (inaudible) logistics and it just so you know it let's see we can get it by the board… Provides as I'm sitting here… Steward by the death of the previous chief steward and my showing up and just sort of doing that, why not do this. 

00:44:05
BILL O'HANLON So it's sort of you were engaged in some activity if you will and it showed up there must be a different way or a better way to speak about this or do this. So what kind of… what kind of activities are you're engaged in these days? 

00:44:25
BEN Well, I'm a member of my congregation. Uh… Let's see I'm not engaged in a lot of stuff. I'm a (inaudible) college faculty member and teach one class. 

00:44:35
BILL O'HANLON So let's start with the congregation, so I think that maybe there's, you know, (inaudible) while the person asked about stories and the structure of stories. I think that for me creativity has a bunch of different faces, but one of them is a problem-solving, it's like there's a better way to do this. So here's my assignment for you, you think what's a problem in the congregation that keeps recurring and we always have the same response or we try and solve it and it doesn't get solved and then you deliver that to the deep inside your unconscious whatever that stuff that generates creativity and you say "I don't know the answer to this, but this is the thing I'm asking, you know, I'm… I'm wanting to have a solution or creative response to and so you might go around and talk to people (inaudible) some of the bugs (inaudible) it's not working well or keeps frustrating you or that you'd like to do but it hadn't been able to get there, start with that so (inaudible) we can turn on it. Water a little just get a little flow through it. 

00:45:45
BEN Yeah, I mean, one of the things I was thinking I was looking at umm… you know, we're pretty non denominational non like the (inaudible) group so I was thinking a little bit what… what Irving (inaudible) was saying yesterday and, you know, maybe using that it seem what where this was intersect with a group that has at least anomaly religious thing where it wouldn't write a little article about that or write (inaudible) something to Jeff for the newsletter. 

00:46:15
BILL O'HANLON Cool, okay. So that's… that's an area at least that, you know, so my senses deliver that to the stuff that, you know, creativity is very mysterious to me, you know, because it's like "Okay, be created." I don't know how to do that and creativity shows up for me. So some mechanism is doing that and it doesn't show up in all areas because, you know, occasionally I get an off-the-wall idea have nothing to do with and I think I don't know who I'd give this too because I don't even know anybody in that area. But most of the time it's something I know something about and I'm involved in "Oh, that's the way to think about that or that's a way to write that song or you know, sometimes it just takes a couple of days of being in problem of it or the… the… the considering it or something. 

00:47:00
BEN I think it's also taking your thought seriously, so you know taking some of these deliberations seriously like there's things that, you know, some things are just dead ends and silly. 

00:47:10
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:47:10
BEN And some of the things, you know, this is… this is kind of like "Let's play with this." 

00:47:15
BILL O'HANLON Yeah. 

00:47:15
BEN This has… this has got some juice. This has got something. 

00:47:20
BILL O'HANLON Yeah… yeah. Okay, good. Yeah, I like that. Umm… Yeah, I think that's right and, you know. I was telling I was getting conversational (inaudible) last time when I was saying "I am a really great sleeper like eight hours a night typically and I've been that way for years" and I wrote all these books and one of the things you used to really bug me was the books would come to me in the middle of the night and I would be like (inaudible) up in bed and have a complete outline for my book, having thought about it for, you know, having considered for I knew there was something I wanted to write about typically. And if I didn't get up, in the morning I would have a vague recollection of what that thing was, but it wouldn't be that crystal clarity and I made myself which I hated to do it because I love to sleep. Get up and actually type or write the whole outline and then I go back to sleep and sometimes it would take me a little while to go back to sleep because that was such a stimulating thought. But most of the time I could go back to sleep, but I didn't want to get up for the 15 minutes or whatever it would take me to write down the outline I… I love to sleep that much and… and but I took it serious because I thought this is a book and if I don't capture it now it may not be there, so partly taken creativity seriously when it delivers the response you say "Okay, thank you Muse! I'm writing it down now and I'm taking it seriously and then partly taking the areas seriously might help." Okay, good… good. I like that. Okay, anything else? 

00:48:40
BEN That's great. 

00:48:45
BILL O'HANLON Okay, that's enough to at least… 

00:48:45
BEN Gets me started I think… 

00:48:45
BILL O'HANLON Get you started and… 

00:48:50
BEN Yeah, I mean, you know, guess me, you know, I mean, a couple of ideas that were sort of rolling around as you were talking about that and you know. 

00:48:55
BILL O'HANLON Creative ideas?

I tell some stories there. Okay, so here's a question for you. I have a question for you. What stories that I tell first I'm gonna make it harder when Catherine and I worked together? Here I'm gonna say why I asked this question because to me storytelling is like a dream.

But, you know, not that many stories and look at they're both totally transform and cured so. No, I'm just… All right, so I think that's good enough. Thanks.

Any other questions or you just want to go out and get ready for the next session? What's next? Yeah, okay, you got. Okay, hurry up. Two minutes… two minutes or one minute to ask your question and one minute for my answer. 

00:53:50
UNKNOWN Uh… I find sometimes in therapy that my eyes are wandering and I noticed you're turning and looking up. Umm… I'm wondering if that's a problem for the client in terms of uh… losing eye contact? 

00:54:05
BILL O'HANLON Well, we'll ask Ben was that a problem… We'll ask Catherine, was that a problem for your Catherine and Ben (inaudible) and there's little pressure here because they want to make me look good, but I didn't experience that as a problem and I didn't have a sense that they did. But you know, for some clients it might be a problem. Yeah… yeah, so it hasn't been. And I usually don't have this kind of chair. It's bad thing to put me in this chair… They just give me one (inaudible). In my office I have on that just stays still. Because I'm like "(inaudible) I do family therapy." I'm… When I'm n one of these chairs I am I'm like "Mom, did you hear what he just… and you know, did you, you know, I don't think he mean it that way, what do you think he meant. I have this idea what he meant. And then I okay, so she had the sense to (inaudible) when you say, you know, I'm like all over the place don't give me a wheelchair, you know. In family therapy, it's actually pretty good, but in individual therapy it's not good because I'm just like, you know, (inaudible) but you know, I'm just as I am and people either like me or they don't or they get something valuable out of it or they don't, you know, what can I say that's it. I'm not on any medications. So you know, it might help, but I have no desire. Okay, really quickly here. 

00:55:15
UNKNOWN Hi, Bill! 

00:55:15
BILL O'HANLON Hi! 

00:55:20
UNKNOWN I just wanted to thank you because that's the truth. You are and you are just you and I admired that. Thank you. 

00:55:30
BILL O'HANLON Thank you. It's Thank you. It's taken me a lifetime to get here. You know, it's funny thing. I think we are born as we are and then we develop socially. And then for me it's been like a 40 or 50-year journey to come back to who I am without shame and without hiding and without embarrassment and just to be as goofy and quirky and screwed up as I am. And I was telling a story. We have one more minute. I was telling story in the last workshop about a time and (inaudible) I appreciate that's because we've been in family therapy land for a long time, but Carl Whittaker, Late Carl Whittaker, you know, and Michael (inaudible) you know this umm… Carl Whittaker, psychiatrist family therapist, very few psychiatrist family therapists. Mostly psychologists, social workers, marriage and family therapists .There's a few and so Carl Whittaker was one of them, systemic family therapy, he saw whole groups in his office. And Carl was a wild man and very controversial any (inaudible) you know, people whoever diagnosed with schizophrenia with baby bows and he didn't have great boundaries especially in the 60s. He did things that people would consider unethical. He got ousted from his Head of Psychiatry position someplace I think Oakridge and Frank Pittman comes in and takes place, another psychiatrist family therapist, but Frank he not so loose. He's like I know what's right, I know what's wrong and I'm happy to tell you, you know, and I once joked with Frank on your… on your tombstone it'll say "I was right and I knew and I told you." And he said that's I would be happy to have that on my tombstone. So umm… very righteous, very mild, so he comes in he hears all these stories about Whittaker's boundary less (inaudible) and he totally down on (inaudible) down and they don't speak for years. Finally, Louisiana… There's an American Associated American Marriage and Family Therapy meeting and the two of them are both gonna be presenting there and I haven't met for years and, you know, we're all watching the younger therapists watching the Clash of the Titans as they walk down the hall. Carl's, you know, in the end… near the end of his life and he has had thrombosis and he's walking kinda slowly and he sees Frank up ahead and Frank sees and Frank's walking down the hall like this, you know, and they get up to one another. They haven't said a word and we're all watching from the wings and, you know, they get right up to one another and Carl just raises his head he said "Frank, (inaudible) consolation to you. I've been a big disappointment to myself as well." And Frank just nodded his head and off they went. And, you know, there was no big, you know, Clash of the Titans, but I… I saw Carl Whittaker (inaudible) that's how I want to be when I grow up. I'm all fucked up and it's totally okay. All right, so that's it for this one. Thank you.
