JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Hello, my name is John Sommers-Flanagan. I'm a Professor of Counselor Education at the University of Montana. I'm also the author of a text book, Clinical Interviewing, an exciting title. Uh… Chapter eight of Clinical Interviewing is all about the Mental Status Examination, which will be focus of our lecture today. And thank you guys for coming. Mental Status Examination, it sounds, kind of, imposing and in some ways it is. Our goals, is just cut to the chase. Our goals today are to expose you to the mental status examination. In fact, it is a common language, especially in medical settings, but also professional counselors need to and are required to have some competency in the mental status examination. Our goal will be to understand the three parts of assessment, in general, as they apply to the administration and the writing of the mental status examination report. I just want to give you a feel, we're gonna be doing a little experiential thing, I'll be asking for a volunteer, for how is to be administered and what it's like to have the questions, some of the questions of the mental status examination, asked of you. We're also gonna focus on… so that you can understand and articulate the nine standard mental status examination categories. And you're not gonna be tested, no way. May be, we should have a test on that, at the end. Before we start, before we talk about the mental status, we want to talk about assessments and I know, I've said before in other lectures, that the clinical interview often has a reputation and it's somewhat true for being an assessment interview and that can be imposing. A lot of times we don't want to evaluate our clients, we don't want to be too structured, we want to let clients talk about whatever they want to talk about. But there are… also are times and places when some kind of structured assessment is appropriate and helpful. Because everything is assessment, assessment is ubiquitous, you guys are assessing me, I'm assessing you and that's partly because we cannot not communicate, right. If you're nodding I feel like, maybe even if you're not listening my interpretation or my conclusion is, wow, they're really listening to me, okay. And you guys are probably picking up on different things about me. We probably are also assessing the temperature of the room, is it comfortable? And there are all kinds of things we seem to be and I don't like the word wired, but we seem to be built to judge, right. Built to judge and that's what we're gonna do with the mental status exam, which is why we need to look at, uh… not only the purpose, but we're gonna look at some of the… the three dimensions of assessment. Umm… the purpose of the mental status exam is to just give you a structured method for organizing your clinical observations, okay. And those observations are about mental state or mental status, the mental status is also used to communicate about mental status, primarily in medical settings, but other settings as well. They're also used to write reports and so you do a mental status examination and then you write one long paragraph, report. And you, hopefully type it out and you submit it, so that's in the medical record or in your counseling records. You can see some sample mental status reports, umm… are available on a blog site that I have, at johnsommersflanagan.com, I say that partly because we don't have a lot of time to cover the report writing part, because we're gonna get through these nine categories and we're gonna do it quickly, okay. These are the nine categories, let's go over them really quickly, general overview. Appearance, appearance of the client. Behavior/psychomotor activity, that would involve eye-contact, looking around, movement, any kind of posturing. Attitude toward the examiner, very subjective, right. What's your attitude toward me, if you're my client? What's the attitude toward the interviewer? Affect and mood, they're different, we'll explore how. Speech and thought, they're connected, we'll talk about that. Perceptual disturbances, really three kinds that we'll get to, soon, and talk about. Orientation and consciousness, this has to do with, do you know where you are? And do you… are you, are you conscious or are you a little crowded? Memory and intelligence, very controversial, how much can we really tell in a short mental status examination about intelligence in particular, I would have to say, not much, but it's a part of the protocol. And last of all, reliability judgment and insight, kind of, lumped together and we'll define that or those, a bit later. So, now the three parts of assessment. This is partly because we need to caution and hold ourselves back, because we're so naturally built to judge, it's easy to judge each other and sometimes not in positive ways. Umm… So, we need to be able to be clear about these three different parts of assessment. First part, observation, very neutral, I see a head nodding, okay. I see that, that doesn't involve any hypotheses about what that might mean, oh, she is paying attention, that might be a hypotheses. She could be paying attention or I might come to a conclusion, these are three different things. We got to make sure we don't get them confused. A lot of people will get… jump to a conclusion and Stanley Sue, who is a multicultural expert would say we need to exercise scientific mindedness, meaning that we observe something and may be we'll observe thing that we think is a cultural difference. But we can't assume that it's a cultural difference. We can't assume that it's related to culture or ethnicity. Instead, we just build up hypotheses, oh, it might be, it might be that I need to focus on this, because this person has a particular cultural background. He used it in multicultural counseling, I'm saying we use it also in the mental status exam, we use scientific mindedness, observation, very neutral hypotheses, gentle exploration of what things might mean. And then eventually, conclusion, which might also include diagnosis, which is a little intimidating. So, we're gonna practice, I'm gonna ask for a volunteer. Anybody who is feeling brave? 

00:07:05
KELLY ANN CHANEY Sure. Excellent. 

00:07:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Thank you. Thank you very much. 

00:07:10
KELLY ANN CHANEY No problem. 

00:07:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN You know, life could not go on without a volunteer. I really appreciate it. So, umm… we're gonna… actually, I'm gonna introduce the mental status examination. Umm… And then I'm going to administer it and I'm gonna have you guys all observe. And I say here you should write your observations and interpretations, just write them in your brains. So, use your best penmanship or penpersonship. So here is an example of what we're gonna do as I'd administer this to, your name? 

00:07:45
KELLY ANN CHANEY Kelly. 

00:07:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Kelly. Okay, Kelly. Thank you. So, as I administer a few parts of a mental status to Kelly, I want you guys to be thinking about those differences, observations, hypotheses, conclusions, okay. So, for example, an observation might be, she said, whatever she said. Hypotheses might be, it could mean this or it could mean that, right. We want to start making educating guesses about what our observations might mean. And then conclusions, what she is, okay. And you can see here, I have come up with some examples, 'cause I want you guys to be able to do this with me, the behavior and behavior in psychomotor activity in that category of the MSE, may be the person has very little eye-contact, may be Kelly is not having much eye-contact. So, I might then have hypotheses, it could be a cultural difference, right. It could be shyness, anxiety. It could be a sign of respect, okay. Could be she is tired, right. They're all kinds of different things it might mean. And I would say, don't make any conclusions, I'm gonna really try to hold you guys back for making and jumping to conclusions. Here is a memory in that category of memory and intelligence. I'm gonna have her remember three things. Let's say she… when I ask her back, she misses two out of the three, that's unusual. It could be anxiety, could be distractibility, right. This is sort of a stressful environment, may be something distracted you. Could be a memory problem, could be fatigue, right. All those things. You're a graduate student, you're probably tired. 

00:09:20
KELLY ANN CHANEY Right. 

00:09:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So… Okay, so are you guys ready? So, umm… I'm gonna ask you, Kelly. I'm gonna ask you some questions, some of them are gonna be easy, some of them will be harder, some of them will be straight forward and some of them may be kind of weird. 

00:09:35
KELLY ANN CHANEY Okay. 

00:09:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. And it's just sort of a… it's a process that I go through with people. It's a way for me to get to know a little bit about how you're doing, okay. And in particular, a little bit about how your brain is doing. Does that sound okay? 

00:09:50
KELLY ANN CHANEY Ready. 

00:09:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. Good, good, there is something in there. 

00:09:50
KELLY ANN CHANEY Right. 

00:09:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN All right. So, umm… my first question is, what is your full name? 

00:10:00
KELLY ANN CHANEY Kelly Ann Chaney. 

00:10:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Kelly Ann Chaney, excellent. And where are we? 

00:10:05
KELLY ANN CHANEY We're at Governors State University. 

00:10:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN We're at Governors State University. That's what I think too. 

00:10:10
KELLY ANN CHANEY Right. 

00:10:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. And what is today's date? 

00:10:15
KELLY ANN CHANEY May 19, 2015. All right. 

00:10:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN All right. And what are we doing here? 

00:10:20
KELLY ANN CHANEY Uh… Videotaping. 

00:10:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:10:25
KELLY ANN CHANEY Well, that's it. 

00:10:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN All right, excellent. Now do you mind if I do a little check on your memory? 

00:10:30
KELLY ANN CHANEY Sure. 

00:10:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So here is a memory question. I'm gonna say three objects. And I would just like you, when I'm finished, to repeat them back to me. 

00:10:35
KELLY ANN CHANEY All right. 

00:10:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay? Banana, watch, newspaper. 

00:10:40
KELLY ANN CHANEY Okay. Banana, watch, newspaper. 

00:10:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN All right, three out of three. Okay, good. Now I have a harder one. 

00:10:50
KELLY ANN CHANEY Okay. 

00:10:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN This one has numbers in it, some people don't like numbers, some people really like numbers. I'd like you to start at the number 100 and count backwards by sevens, so like 100 minus seven and then keep going until I have you stop. 

00:11:10
KELLY ANN CHANEY Okay. 100, 93, 80, uh… 73, maybe, let's see, umm… 70 63, 50… 

00:11:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. I'm gonna have you stop as you got to 50. 

00:11:35
KELLY ANN CHANEY Okay. All right. 

00:11:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I usually have people stop when they get to about 50. 

00:11:35
KELLY ANN CHANEY Okay. 

00:11:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So one of the things about when you're faced with the hard task is sometimes you also will have thoughts about how it's going, what were your thoughts says as I was having you do that? 

00:11:50
KELLY ANN CHANEY I'm gonna screw this up. 

00:11:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN So you're thinking, I don't know, I'm gonna screw this up. 

00:11:55
KELLY ANN CHANEY Umm… This is harder than it sounds. 

00:12:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN It's harder than it sounds. It's also much harder on camera. 

00:12:00
KELLY ANN CHANEY Right. 

00:12:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So… So, now we've been talking a little bit about, I've been asking you a couple of questions about your memory and, kind of, how your math skills are and stuff like that. Now is it okay if I ask you about your mood? 

00:12:15
KELLY ANN CHANEY Sure. 

00:12:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So now, on a scale 0 to 10, 0 is the absolute bottom. You're so down and depressed, you're just going to kill yourself. 

00:12:25
KELLY ANN CHANEY All right. 

00:12:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 10 is as happy as you could possibly be. So 0 is the bottom, 10 is… may be, I don't know, maybe you're dancing, singing… 

00:12:30
KELLY ANN CHANEY Right. 

00:12:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN …doing karaoke, I don't know, whatever you do when you're at a 10. Right now, in this moment, what would you rate your mood? 

00:12:40
KELLY ANN CHANEY Probably a nine. 

00:12:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN A nine? So pretty high. What's going on to make it a nine? 

00:12:45
KELLY ANN CHANEY Umm… New start to the summer semester, uh… finishing the spring semester. 

00:12:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yes. 

00:12:50
KELLY ANN CHANEY Umm… family is healthy, I'm healthy. 

00:12:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. So lot of positive things going on in that transition from the spring to the summer. Feels pretty good. 

00:13:00
KELLY ANN CHANEY Right. 

00:13:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. 

00:13:05
KELLY ANN CHANEY One week off, woo-hoo! 

00:13:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN All right, good. So a nine, that's… that's great. So, umm… Now I'm gonna ask you a couple of funny questions. 

00:13:15
KELLY ANN CHANEY Okay. 

00:13:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN If you had a million dollars suddenly, I don't know, maybe you won it or had it given to you, somehow you just got a million dollars in your possession, what would you do with it? 

00:13:30
KELLY ANN CHANEY Umm… The first thing I would do will pay my student loans. 

00:13:30
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:13:35
KELLY ANN CHANEY Second will be pay-off my home. And then the rest I'll probably invest in my children's education. 

00:13:40
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So you got three things pretty clear. Student loans, home, children's education. Okay, big priorities for you. 

00:13:50
KELLY ANN CHANEY Uh-huh. 

00:13:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN All right. And then, umm… what if you were to find, you were… you know, maybe you're out close to your home and you found a gun in the bushes, what would you do? 

00:14:00
KELLY ANN CHANEY Turn it in. 

00:14:00
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Turn it in? Okay, what would you do right there at that moment, though? 

00:14:05
KELLY ANN CHANEY Probably look around to see if there is somebody, that's coming for it, somebody… 

00:14:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN …is looking at. 

00:14:10
KELLY ANN CHANEY …running away… 

00:14:10
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. 

00:14:10
KELLY ANN CHANEY …from this, you know, where I am at, finding it. 

00:14:15
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Yeah. Okay, all right. Good. All right, now one more hard one, you're ready? 

00:14:20
KELLY ANN CHANEY Okay. 

00:14:20
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN I'm gonna have you remember some presidents. Start with the current President and then go back in time, umm… uh… maybe if you can get to four or five? 

00:14:30
KELLY ANN CHANEY Well, I'm pretty young, so that may be only about two or three. 

00:14:35
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN We will get to it, as far as you can get it. 

00:14:35
KELLY ANN CHANEY Okay. Umm… Obama, Clinton, Bush, Bush, Reagan, Ford… 

00:14:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN That's hard. 

00:14:50
KELLY ANN CHANEY Okay, okay. 

00:14:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Great, thank you. 

00:14:55
KELLY ANN CHANEY You're welcome. 

00:14:55
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN All right. Now, so that, we've done a little bit of mental statusy stuff. And now I'm gonna have everybody think about this together with me. And, umm… are you guys ready? So, now I would like you to think about these five categories for now, with regard to Kelly. And so in terms of appearance, if she is in the room with me and I'm doing a mental status exam, I'm gonna be evaluating her appearance, right. Typically, in the area of appearance, I'm looking is she well groomed? Okay. Is she disheveled? Okay. Part of appearance also includes smell. Did she smell okay? Okay. So gonna how did she look and how is she in the room? Okay. And uh… I want you guys to be thinking about, well, what did you notice about her appearance. What do you notice about her appearance now as you look at her? The second category, behavior/psychomotor activity, what did you notice about her behavior/psychomotor activity? Did she fidget a lot? She wiggle around? Did she posture? Did she get up in pace? All kinds of different things somebody might do and be thinking about in those three categories. We want to stick mostly with observations for now. Some of those things might mean something, if she had super dilated pupils, for example. I might think, hmm… I wonder if there is a possibility that she has used marijuana, okay. So, that might be a hypotheses, I certainly wouldn't jump to that conclusion. But then if she smells a little bit like marijuana and her eyes are dilated, so then I've got two pieces of evidence that might take me further down that hypotheses and a little more toward the conclusion, okay. Attitude toward the examiner, very subjective, we'll go through some adjectives, we use to describe that. Orientation and consciousness, memory and intelligence, those are the things that, you know, she is fully oriented, no doubt about her, right. She knows her name, she knows where she is, she knows her… the date, that's sometimes the hardest for people. 

00:17:05
KELLY ANN CHANEY Right. 

00:17:05
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN And she knows what's going on. And memory and intelligence, I just, kind of, touched on that a little bit. We'll… We'll go to those categories a little in more depth in just a few moments. Now think about appearance and how many judgments we make. I'm gonna read you what a guy, by the name of Smith, wrote in a book that he published called the mental status examination and brief social history in clinical psychology. He wrote, "A Fu-Manchu mustache suggests the wearer doesn't mind being thought of as bad, whereas a handlebar mustache tells you the person maybe somewhat of a dandy or narcissist." Okay, I find this hilarious. What mistake is he making? He is over there in that third column, right, he is jumping to conclusions. I know he says, may be somewhat of a dandy or narcissist, but it feels to me like he's gone there, right. He is making that judgment. So, one of the things we wouldn't want to do with Kelly and we wouldn't want to do with our clients is to jump to that conclusion. So, we're gonna go over the categories and appearance we've already, kind of, discussed a little bit. Umm… I do remember one funny appearance thing, I had a boy who smelled so bad that I could barely be in the room with him and it's hard, but I just said look, there is something going on here. And it was his shoes and they gotten wet and he… and I said, look, we're gonna go take these shoes and throw them in the garbage right now, we did. And I said, we're getting you new shoes, because you cannot go around in your life smelling like this, it's gonna make your life worse. So, that was, sort of, an appearance thing, a vivid one for me. So behavior/psychomotor activity, we're looking at eye-contact, okay. Well, how was Kelly's eye-contact? We're looking, you know, at the people get up and move and pace. We're looking at typewriter leg, you know, what that is, type-writer leg, it's, kind of, funny thing. Smith, in his book says that this sign is always a sign of severe disturbance or it could be two lattes, or a severe disturbance, I don't know. Posturing, you know, what kind of posture, gestures, things like that, all that comes under behavior/psychomotor activity. We want to look for consistencies across these categories, attitude toward the examiner. I mean, if I were to say, well, how was Kelly with me? I would say she was, I would pick cooperative of this list. I would pick open. I felt like she was both of those things, that's pretty easy, that's gonna be a really positive thing. But, you know, you've been with people who might fit some of these other adjectives better. Ingratiating, hostile, suspicious, okay, all those things are possible. Affect and Mood, now the traditional question is, how are you feeling today? And I wait for your response so that I can get a verbatim. I varied from that, because I wanted to do a 0 to 10 rating scale. And rating scale is another good way to evaluate mood. Now mood is your report, okay. That's the client's report. Affect is my observation, I may observe her as having a flat affect, a brittle affect, a depressed affect, a euphoric affect, a labile affect, none of those really fit for you. I would say, instead, sort of a within normal limits affect, right, seems pretty normal. Speech, umm… so you look with speech at the rate and the volume and the amount. Sometimes you also look at disturbances in speech, there were no disturbances, not stuttering, no, uh… lisping, no significant speech disturbances. Was her speech pressured, no. But if we had somebody who had really pressured speech, really loud speech and a lot of speech, who wouldn't stop talking, we could think, oh, maybe there is some kind of manic episode going on, right. Again that might be a hypotheses that we make. In this case, speech was of normal rate and volume, okay. And thought, now thought and speech are related, one of the ways that we get to thought is through speech, that makes sense. So, umm… circumstantial is when you, kind of, go out and talk about some things, kind of unrelated, but then to get back to the topic, okay. Lot of college professors do that, okay. They tell stories, they go off on tangents, but they come back to their point, hopefully. Now tangential is when you don't ever get back to your point or flat of ideas, you're gone. You're saying things like, wow, you know, I went to the bakery and then, you know what, they're having an incredible sale at the… umm… you know, and you just go off and then you might be talking about outer space and you might be talking about Switzerland, then you might just boom, boom, boom and there's no rhyme or reason or connection, it's tangential. Perseverative, you say the same thing over, and over, and over. Thought content, obsessions are recurrent and persistent ideas… they just, you know, you keep thinking, did I turn my stove off? Did I turn my stove off? I wonder, if I turned my stove off. I don't know if I turn my stove off, right. So that goes over, and over, and over. Delusions are false beliefs, okay. If, for example, I said what is your name and she said I am… and I had a client one time say this, I'm Jesus Christ, that might suggest that there is a false belief, okay. Again, we want to be attentive, but it's, in all likelihood, a good hypotheses. Perceptual Disturbances we put into three categories, illusions, flashbacks, hallucinations. I think you guys know what they are. Illusions are something that sometimes just connected with people who have sort of schizotypal or some people says schizotypal, you know, some people say banana, some people say banana, no, they don't. But I like to say schizotypal and it's an illusion is when there something there, right. Umm… There is a cup, there is a… some glasses, there is a note pad and you, kind of, see, oh, looks like, kind of, a face. If I look at this, and if, you know, so you take something that's there and it seems to jump out at you. Sometimes people would see like, in wood pattern, on the door, they'll see different bodies or images, okay, its illusions. Hallucinations are perceptions without any sensory reality, okay. So, you hear a voice and no one else hears it, you see something, no one else sees, okay. You feel like bugs are crawling on your skin and there are no bugs, okay. So, auditory hallucinations most of it is schizophrenia. Visual, mostly come out of organic, may be, umm… hit on the head, something like that. And tactile are most often drug related, although drug related can be visual as well, okay. So flash back says, we know, it's a previous event that, sort of, has come back and may be the most classic or common example are with military veterans, who on the 4th of July, hear fireworks and they're back in a battle scene, right. Flash back. Orientation and Consciousness. Kelly was right on, right. She was oriented to person, place, time and situation, we might just write O times 4. You might describe her consciousness in different ways and you can see the list of adjectives there, but obviously, she is alert, okay. She is alert. Memory and Intelligence, okay. So the three objects and now I'm gonna ask you a tricky question. You're ready? 

00:24:45
KELLY ANN CHANEY Okay. 

00:24:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN What were those three objects? 

00:24:50
KELLY ANN CHANEY Banana, watch and newspaper. 

00:24:50
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Ah! Yeah. So memory, immediate memory, when she reported them right back to me and now intermediate or short-term memory also seems to be intact. Good sign. Digit span, it's a little immediate thing, but we never did that, umm… we did the serial 7s, umm… I could do some abstract thinking evaluations. So, you can see there are different questions I could have focused on and serial 7s is a calculation thing. Now one of the problems with serial 7s, is people with any kind of anxiety about math or low math self-esteem will fumble that. And you did get some things wrong… 

00:25:25
KELLY ANN CHANEY Right. 

00:25:25
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN …on the serial 7s. I would probably attribute that as not related to intelligence, but more related to anxiety in the moment as well as may be not a lot of confidence that, you know, it's like that… that saying, I thought there would no math. 

00:25:45
KELLY ANN CHANEY Right, right. 

00:25:45
JOHN SOMMERS-FLANAGAN Okay. So reliability, judgment, insight. Umm… So this is truthfulness, reliability or honesty in reporting, adaptive choices. Now judgment is a very subjective thing too. I mean, I asked her the million dollar question, and the gun in the bushes question. She is great. I've had kids say to me, well, I get that gun and I'd… I'd see if it worked, you know. Ah… Or they would, you know, million dollar… I had a boy one time say to me, I had a million dollars, I think, I would I give some away and then he say, ah, no, I wouldn't. I'd fly to Hawaii and I'd buy as much dope as I could and just get high for the rest of my life, you know. And so, tells me something about him, about his values and his judgment, right. And then understanding your mental condition. So if I were to ask you about, well, how do you feel like you're doing. And you have some good sense of that, then you have pretty good insight or at least partial insight into how you're doing. Umm… And so that's what the term insight refers to. Really quickly, we're just about done. Uh… Sample Mental Status report. Read the first sentence, this is too much for us to read, it's just here for illustrations. But this is how it would start. Gary Sparrow, a 48-year-old white male, was disheveled and unkempt on presentation to the hospital emergency room. He was wearing dirty khaki pants, an unbuttoned golf shirt, white shoes and appeared slightly younger than his stated age. So, you're gonna do that, you're gonna, uh… report that in one medium to long size paragraph. Okay. I can see you guys are reading, it's fascinating, isn't it? I made this one up, it's not a real person. I just made it up, I thought it would be, kind of, funny. Clearly, you can read here, during the interview, he was agitated and restless, frequently changing seats. He was impatient and sometimes rude in his interactions with this examiner. Mr. Sparrow reported that today was the best day of his life, because he had decided to join the professional golf circuit. And, you know, he thinks that he is the illegitimate son of somebody I forget. Anyway, he'll… he thinks he is the illegitimate son of Jack Nicholas. I… You know, this is just a creative thing. I made it up, okay? There is no person like this. But you can see it's a pretty long, inclusive, paragraph that includes all nine of those categories in the mental status examination. So, some concluding comments. For the most part, the MSE is pure assessment. Now I say that with the caveat, I have done a lot of them. And I like to use them, kind of, therapeutically, like when I ask Kelly about what were you thinking during the serial 7s, during the math problem. Sometimes what people think about is as revealing in terms of doing later therapy as whether they get the math problems right or not, okay. And so I think, we can use this sensitively and therapeutically. Uh… You'll probably notice that I used some other things as I introduced it to you, I… I used role induction or psycho-education to tell you a little bit about what was gonna go on. So hopefully to make you comfortable and not as if I'm, sort of, dissecting you and evaluating you. It's a very common communication tool in medical settings, it's very susceptible to interviewer or examiner bias and bad judgment, as you saw with the examples from Dr. Smith, who thinks that Fu-Manchu mustaches are super bad news. In addition, umm… we really need to know all about it, but to be careful in using it. Now so I've used it so much, I'm very comfortable with it. I love it. I love being judgmental and speculating on what might be going on. But that is all the more reason to exercise caution, because the more comfortable we get with things, the more wild and inappropriate we can be. And so I would say for myself, I constantly have to reign myself in, to not be too clinically judgmental. And so I hope, by attending this lecture, that you guys can also experience both the excitement of doing a mental status exam as well as the cautions that we should exercise. So thank you, all, very much for listening.
