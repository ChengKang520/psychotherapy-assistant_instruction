MICROTRAINING ASSOCIATES (888)505-5576 www.emicrotraining.com The Psychology of Racism and Antiracism A Four Lecture Series by Derald Wing Sue, Ph.D Surviving Racism: A Message to People of Color 

00:00:00
DERALD WING SUE  Welcome again to the fourth in the lecture series of, ah, The Psychology of Racism and Antiracism. My name is Derald Wing Sue. Today's topic is, ah, surviving racism, a personal message to my brothers and sisters of color. Ah, today's presentation really is based upon uhm, ah, my new book that, ah, I'd like to share with you today, is, ah, called Overcoming, ah, Our Racism: A Journey To Liber, ah, the Journey To Liberation, which, ah, deals specifically with what we have been talking about throughout this uhm, ah, lecture series. Today's uhm, ah, presentation is specifically for my brothers and sisters of color. And as a result, uhm, ah, what I would like to do is share with you some of my own personal experiences and some, ah, examples that will give, uhm, our White brothers and sisters some idea of the situation and dilemma that we face in terms of trying to survive against racism, ah, within the society. Now, let me share with you some of my early experiences in order to give you an idea of, of what it is like for people of color to day in and day out experience what I have called micro-insults, micro-aggressions, and micro-invalidations from our white brothers and sisters who themselves are unaware of how they are oppressing us in this manner. I recalled, uhm, years ago, while attending elementary grade school we had originally lived in Chinatown in Portland, Oregon, and attended elementary school for the first, uhm, ah, three years or so, until my father purchased a home in the, uhm, ah, Southeast District of Portland, Oregon. That, uhm, district was predominantly White. In fact, my brothers and I were the only individuals of color to attend the school. I recalled our experience during the first day, uhm, at ah, Abernethy, ah, Grade School. Ah, we were obviously the only, ah, students of color there and the students teased us in a way that was, ah, very damaging and detrimental to, uhm, ah, all of us. Now, in those days, the schools during the, ah, recess and, ah, lunch hours had loose coalitions of, ah, (coughs) excuse me, as of, groups of students who form, uhm, a gang. They weren't gangs in the sense that we know of it, uhm, ah, today but most students belong to one or the other and they would engage in friendly jousting with one another. None of us were allowed to be a member of these loosely affiliated groups. Indeed, we were oftentimes the butt of jokes. One afternoon I remember when my brother, Stan, and I were, uhm, ah, attending Abernethy and just going there in the morning, we were surrounded by one particular group who circled us and sang, ah, in sing song ah, ah, fashion, e-yah-e-yah, and they started laughing, making fun of, of, uhm, ah, what they thought, uhm, ah, was Chinese. They also said things like ching-chong Chinaman, chanting, uhm, ah, continually and it had really quite a harmful effect upon, ah, on my brothers and I. That was not as damaging, however, as, uhm, ah, several weeks later when I was in front of my grade, uhm, ah, the classroom, ah, talking to my brother, Stan in Chinese and the bell in the school was about to, uhm, ah, ring. The teacher had just come out of her room, uhm, ah, to close the door before I heard(ph) the ringing of the bell, overheard my brother, uhm, ah, and I talking in Chinese. Upon, ah, that time, she marched over to both of us, looked at me directly and said to me, "Derald, you're in America now. When you're in America, you speak English. Now, get into the classroom now." Uhm, I felt totally humiliated. I ran off, uhm, into the classroom, sat on my desk and sunk as low as I could. I could not understand what I had done that was wrong. And I recall that, ah, afternoon when class was out, going back home, still humiliated and feeling that there was something wrong with me, ah, coming into the house where my mother was working in the kitchen, washing dishes and all of a sudden, she began usual, uhm, ah, parental fashion, how did your school day go? Ah, and she asked it in Chinese of which I exploded and became angry and told my mother, I never wanna speak Chinese again because that's the reason why we're not accepted at school. And I stormed up to my, uhm, ah, room after that. Now, the lesson upon reflection, after seeing this, uhm, was that I was made to feel ashamed of my own racial cultural(ph) heritage because language is the carrier of one's culture. And if you're made to feel ashamed of your language, you are made to feel ashamed of your culture and since you are an intimate part of that, ah, the culture, I experienced a great deal, ah, of shame. And that was a lesson that I learned that to be, this society continues to if see differences whether linguistic, physical, cultural differences as deviancy and there are strong pressures directed against people who are different in, uhm, ah, in this sense. Now, another example that I can share with you, uhm, ah, this morning, occurred to me after graduating, ah, from Abernethy Grade School. We didn't have middle school. We went directly from, ah, K through, uhm, ah, eight. I entered, uhm, the, you know, the high school, which was Washington High School. And I recalled that during the first few weeks my counselor, Mr. Knutson(ph) who, uhm, ah, was a math science teacher, and that in fact I knew Mister, ah, Knutson(ph) by reputation. He had won, ah, the State of Oregon Outstanding Teacher Award, ah, for about the second or third year, uhm, in a row, because of his skill and his ability to teach science and math very well. And I had looked forward to, uhm, ah, taking many of his classes. I recalled that, uhm, he called me into his office. I received this note from my teacher that says your counselor, Mr. Knutson(ph), uhm, ah, wants to see you. Of course, my immediate reaction was that I had done something wrong. But going in, uhm, ah, to Mr. Knutson's(ph) uhm, office he sat me down and said to me, "Derald, I am so pleased to have you as a student. Ah, I'm your, uhm, ah, counselor. You're going to be, ah, the, my, ah, advisee for the next four years." And he made me feel very warm and welcomed and told me that, "You know, your cousin Larry graduated last year as the Outstanding Math/Science Student. Ah, he won the Bausch and Lomb Science Award." And then Mr. Knutson(ph) turned to me and said to me, "Derald, I know that you have a chance to win the Bausch and Lomb Science Award as the outstanding senior, uhm, ah, science student because you people are good at that. Now, ah, I felt very complimented and flattered by the faith that Mr. Knutson(ph) had, uhm, ah, in me but at the same time I felt a certain degree of discomfort and being trapped. And this was a dilemma that I could not sort out, because how could I feel negatively and I couldn't understand why I felt, uhm, negatively when here was a well-intentioned counselor, educator, someone that I respected, telling me, ah, that he had faith in my ability to succeed, uhm, ah, in the sciences and math. And it was only years later that I realize why I felt uncomfortable. That Mr. Knutson(ph) was equally a victim of his own cultural conditioning. He had stereotypes, that Asians are good in math, good in numbers, uhm, ah, but poor in the social sciences and as a result, I felt in some sense, uhm, ah, truly trapped in terms of this. My experience in, uhm, ah, Washington High School went far beyond stereotyping that occurred. Uhm, ah, that was that many of the, ah, the curriculum and many of the history and social studies textbooks did not talk about Asian-Americans. They talked about Asians in Asia and, as a result of that, I felt a part of me, not accurately (clears throat) portrayed in their educational curriculum. For a young child, this is devastating not to see yourself in the educational materials that are portrayed. And if they are portrayed, they tend to be Asians in Asia, a foreigner, something that I believed is communicated to, ah, people of color constantly. And you hear it in statements, if you don't like it here, go back to Asia, go back to China, go back to Africa, go back to Latin America. These are all statements that are based upon the thought that you are an alien in your own country. I can't go back to China because the United States is my home. And this is something of the mindset of many White Americans and what many, ah, people of color must deal with day in and day out. Another example I would like to share with you, and I'm doing this to give, uhm, our White brothers and sisters an idea of the constant micro-invalidation and racism that we, as people of color, uhm, need to face. And that is that I recalled that I had just, uhm, ah, you know, my wife had just given birth to our son. I was in, ah, living at that time in Oakland, California, considered one of the most integrated, ah, cities in the entire nation. Ah, we lived up near Skyline High School. And, ah, I'm a runner. I love to, ah, jog and run. And I remember one afternoon that I had gotten out, it was something like 90 degrees and I was running down the trail, uhm, ah, passing, ah, ah, Skyline High School when two White neighbor boys, ah, were walking back from school passing me. As they passed me, uhm, ah, they began to, ah, enter into something like, e-yah-e-yah-nya, and burst out laughing. Now, I, again, felt tired. I said that, boy, do I have to cope and deal with this, uhm, issue again? And I said no, it's not worth it. Ah, and I continue jogging down 'til all of a sudden I realize, you know, my son is going to have to grow up in this neighborhood. And at that point, I realized that we never can rest against racism. So, when I reached the end of the, uhm, ah, street I turned around and started jogging back. Now, at this point, the two, uhm, the young White kids knew that I was coming back and, obviously, disturbed by what they had said. And luckily at this point, I was still larger than them, uhm, ah, and as I approached them I could see the apprehension, uhm, in their faces and I came up to them and I'd said, "Did you make fun of me?" And, of course, both of them shook their heads, uhm, ah, saying no. And I said, "Who made those sounds?" (laughs) And they both pointed at one another, uhm, ah, in, in terms of this and I simply said to them, "I never want to hear that again, do you understand?" And they shook their heads and I turned around and continued jogging. Whether that made any difference or not, I really don't know. But I know it made a difference to me in terms of my ability to, uhm, ah, keep a sense of integrity as to being a person of color, uhm, ah, in the United States. Now, these situations represent what I call everyday invalidations that people of color experience. Ah, they, indeed, are only the tip of the iceberg and they move in, into really major issues of racism and prejudice. Many of you know about the situation ah, several years back when Amadu Dealo, a back, Black youngster who, in New York City, was killed in a hail of 42 bullets by police officers. They thought that he was reaching for a gun, indeed, he was picking, uhm, ah, taking out his wallet, but 42 shots, he was hit 19 times and died as a result of this. And it was obvious to me, uhm, ah, whether we call it racism or not, that these police officers had images of a hostile Black, uhm, ah, male in our society that was prone to violence and dangerous. Now, that isn't the point that I'm trying to make here. Uhm, the point I'm trying to make here is a point that, ah, a good colleague and friend of mine, Dr. Nancy Boyd-Franklin, African-American psychologist at Rutgers, uhm, ah, University, she has a Black son. She and I were serving on a panel today, ah, I mean, ah, several, ah, years ago, and she tended to ask a primarily White audience, "Do you realize that when Amadu Dealo was shot, that every Black mother with a teenage son became extremely frightened and apprehensive?" She made it a point to say, "How many of you White folks out there really understand the world view and experience of Black Americans as they encounter, uhm, these situations? Do you realize that I have to, every morning, ask my son where are you going?" If you are going to be stopped by a police officer, what are you going to do? You're going to be polite, you're going to say, "Yes, sir." You're going to keep your hands in full view because of the images and fears and stereotypes. If you go to a shopping mall and are stopped by security guards, how are you going to behave? This is the world of, of people of color in terms of this that my White brothers and sisters seldom, ah, begin to experience. They don't also understand how the realities of people of color are different than the reality of White folks. Another colleague of mine, ah, Dr. Teresa LaFramboise, a Native American psychologist, ah, in speaking on a panel, ah, again with me, asked a primarily White audience, uhm, ah, one, one point, who owns history? Now, I want you to think about the meaning of that question because her implication was that the group that owns history is the group that controls reality. And power is the ability to define reality. If you define reality that Asians are aliens, that Black Americans are, ah, dangerous then, indeed, actions are based upon that particular reality. And as Teresa LaFramboise says, when you are told that Columbus discovered America, well, White folks will accept that in the school system. What about Native American students? They are sitting there and know that Columbus didn't discovered America. In fact, they would say that, how can I, as a Native American who live here be discovered? I knew where I was. Uhm, and it was Columbus in history, as we know now, that was indeed the one that was lost, thinking that he had discovered the continent of, uhm, ah, India. But the point, again, that I would like to make, uhm, ah, at this point, is the impact that it has on Native Americans. The micro-invalidations that they feel oppressed; the knowledge base that people take for granted as ultimate truth, Columbus discovered America. The Native American student fights against that. And the ultimate oppression that comes is in the testing. Let's say that the teacher decides to give a true-false test. Did Columbus discovered America, true or false? And you are a Native American student, how do you respond? If you say false, the teacher marks it wrong. If you say true, you know that you have violated something, an integrity of yourself and a belief system and that you've sold out. This is a dilemma that people of color go through, ah, day in and day out. And I want you to, uhm, uhm, ah, notice it. I would like to read to you, uhm, ah, something that I think will drive home the point of the life experiences of what it is like to be a person of color, ah, in this society. This is written by, ah, a colleague of mine, ah, Dr. Don Locke, uhm, who, ah, I've adapted part of it in, in the last chapter of my book, is, uhm, ah, called Fatigue: An Essay. And Dr. Locke, uhm, ah, talks about it in this way. Ah, his, uhm, essay Fatigue, talks about fatigue and being tired of dealing with these micro-invalidations. Let me read to you what he says, "I am tired of watching mediocre White people continue to rise to positions of authority and responsibility. I am tired of wondering if the White woman, who quickly exited the elevator when I got in, was really at her destination. I am tired of being told that I do not sound Black. I am tired of being told by White people that they don't see color when they interact with me. I am tired of the deadening silence that occurs when the conversation turns to race. I am tired of having to explain why I wish to be called African-American. I am tired of wondering if things will ever get better, wondering if the taxi driver really did not see me trying to hail a cab, being told that I should not criticize racially-segregated country clubs because I wouldn't enjoy associating with people who belong to them anyway. I am tired of being followed in department stores by the security force and pestered by a sales clerk, who refuse to allow me to browse because they suspect I am a shoplifter. I am tired of never being able to let my racial guard down. I am tired of listening to reports about people of color who failed as justification for the absence of other people of color in positions of authority. I am tired of being told that we are just not ready for a Black person in that position. I am tired of having to explain that my sexual fantasies do not center on White women. I am tired of feeling racially-threatened when approached by a law enforcement officer. I am tired of explaining that all African-Americans are not employed to meet some quota. I am tired of being told that I need to openly distance myself from another African-American, ah, whose words have offended someone. I am tired of having people tell me that I have it made and then telling me that I have sold out in order to have what I have. I am tired of having to explain why I am tired. I am tired of being tired." Now, this is a statement that I feel many, ah, people of color understand. And it is something that I ask my brothers and sisters of, ah, who are White to try to understand what happens to us as individuals of color. This was a primary reason why I wrote my last chapter on a personal message to my brothers and sisters of color. The chapter is written in such a way that is in a letter format, not in terms of the traditional academic, uhm, ah, writing. And I would like to share with you the message, ah, part of the message and part of the open letter that I wrote to them. I wrote, Dear brothers and sisters of color, I write this last chapter mainly to you and to those White folks who have marched with us against racism and shown that their hearts are in the right place. Throughout our people's histories, we have had to contend with invalidation, oppression, injustice, terrorism and genocide. Racism is a constant reality in our lives. It is a toxic force that has attempted and sought to strip us of our identities; Take away our dignity; Make us second-class citizens; Destroy our people's cultures and communities; Steal our land and property; Torture, rape, and murder us; Imprison us on reservations, concentration camps, inferior schools, segregated neighborhoods and jails; Use us as guinea pigs in medical experiments and blame our victimization upon the thoughts of our own people. Attempts to express these thoughts have generally been met with disbelief and incredulity by many of our well-intentioned White brothers and sisters. We have oftentimes been asked, aren't you distorting or exaggerating the truth? Where is your proof? Where is your evidence? When we attempt to provide it, we are interrogated about its legitimacy, told that we are biased or paranoid and accused of being dishonest in presenting the facts. After all, they say, our nation is built upon life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It was founded upon the principles of freedom, democracy and equality. Yet, these guiding principles seem intended for Whites only. In the classic book, Animal Farm, when the issue of inequality arose, the character in the position of power justified the treatment by stating, "Some are more equal than others." Rather than offer enlightenment and freedom, education and healing, rather than allowing for equal access and opportunities, historical and current practices in our nation have restricted, stereotyped, damaged, and oppressed persons of color. For too long, people of color have not had the opportunity or power to express their points of view. For too long, our voices have not been heard. For too long, our world views have been diminished, negated or considered invalid. For too long, we have been told that our perceptions are incorrect, that most things are well with our society and that our concerns or complaints are not supported. For too long, we have to had to justify our existence and to fight for our dignity and humanity. No wonder that we are so tired, impatient and angry. Yet, as people of color, we cannot let fatigue turn into hopelessness, nor anger into bitterness. Hopelessness is a forerunner to surrender and bitterness leads to blind hatred. Either could spell our downfall. It is important for us to realize that despite these indignities, we have persevered and become stronger. We have survived through our collective strength. We have survived through our heightened perceptual wisdom. We have survived through our ability to read the contextualized meanings of our oppressors. We have survived through our bicultural flexibility. We have survived through our families and communities. We have survived through our spirituality and religion. We have survived through our racial and ethnic identity and pride. We have survived through our belief in the interconnectedness of the human condition. Unlike many of our White brothers and sisters who are untested, we have demonstrated superhuman resiliency in the face of adversity. Our perseverance in battling the forces of racism come from understanding the strengths and assets developed by our ancestors as they fought oppression and from our cultural values, mores and traditions. As persons of color, we have been subjected to inhuman stressors in our lives. Poverty, high unemployment rates, lower standards of living, conflicting value systems imposed by a White Euro-American society, a history of broad governmental actions that have led to enslavement of Black Americans, the internment of Japanese Americans, and the colonization of Native Americans and constant micro-invalidations and micro-aggressions that strike at the core of our group identities. Am I exaggerating, I ask you? Indeed, Vernon E. Jordan, Jr., attorney and confidante of former President Bill Clinton, speaking in Howard University in June 2002, made that point in startling terms. In making an analogy between the terrorist attack of September 11th and those suffered by Blacks, Jordan stated, "None of this is new to Black people. War, hunger, disease, unemployment, deprivation, dehumanization, and terrorism define our existence. They are not new to us. Slavery was terrorism. Segregation was terrorism. The bombing of four little girls in Sunday school in Birmingham, Alabama, was terrorism. The violent deaths of Medgar, Martin, Malcolm, Vernon, Dahmer, Chaynes(ph), Werner, Goodman, was ter, were terrorism. And the difference between September 11 and the terror visited upon Black people is that on September 11, the terrorists were foreigners. When we were terrorized, it was by our neighbors. The terrorists were American citizens. Now that America is worrying on terrorism, it is Black people who remind America that we know terrorism well. We know that dangerous rhetoric can lead to acts of lunacy and kill innocents. And we know that the surest defense against terrorism is affirmation of America's basic values, the values we learned in our churches, the values we have fought and died for in America's every war even in segregated armies." In light of the historical and continuing experiences of oppression, even I marvel at people's, at, the people of color in their ability to continue their lives in such a normative fashion. It seems that White America exhibits minimal appreciation for the incredible strength and resiliency that we have shown in surviving and sometimes flourishing in the face of racism. Our experiences of oppression have required us to sharpen and hone our survival skills to such a degree that they now represent assets. We have learned this through the courageous and undefeatable actions of our ancestors who showed us the way. It is ironic that overcoming adversity has led us to develop an ability to understand the minds of our o, oppressors with astounding clarity. So when we begin to feel tired and discouraged, when hopelessness seems just around the corner and when we wonder what good our actions are doing, we need to remind ourselves of our strengths and assets that we possess, many of them taught by us, as I've indicated, by our ancestors. We need to take pride in the fact that our heightened perceptual wisdom, ability to rely on nonverbal and contextual meanings, uhm, and the bicultural, ah, flexibility that we have, have brought us to this point of, of, resiliency in the face of adversity. Now, this open letter in my book that I wrote to people of color is not an exaggeration. I know and I have received some feedback that the chapter itself is exceptionally strong and, is it, indeed, real? I think that if you look at the history of the United States, it is a history of racism. And it is a history and an everyday occurrence that White brothers and sisters never think about or realize. And that is one of the reasons why I have to spend one entire tape talking about White privilege and the invisibility of whiteness and how White supremacy intrudes upon the daily experience of individuals of color. Now, in this chapter, I also talk strongly about lessons that I have learned. Sixteen lessons and I'm not sure that I can cover them all today, that I have learned, ah, in my experiences and from talking to my brothers and sisters of color. Let me share with you what the 16 are, in order for you to begin to think about them, uhm, ah, in one fashion or another. The first one- 

00:32:45
PEOPLE OF COLOR AND RACISM 

00:32:45
DERALD WING SUE - is strangely enough, it is important for people of color to experience racism. You know, that seems strange for me to say so, but the reality is that we live in a racist society and facing incidents of racism is a common everyday occurrence, as I've indicated. If we want our sons and daughters to survive, they must learn to develop the ability to deal effectively with it. While it's natural for parents to try to protect them or insulate them from the perils of injustice and discrimination, it will only lead to a false sense of security and deprive them of the ability to develop the necessary survival tools to combat racism. Our task as parents, and as commu, ah, community of color, is to help our children develop the resources to face the forces of, uhm, this society that indeed may be invalidating in many respects. The second lesson I would like to share with you is this, that we will never eradicate or eliminate racism. Well, I cannot prove this statement, there is no way to empirically, ah, ah, prove it, as I mentioned before, racism is as old as history itself. And I believe on a personal, philosophical level, it will always be with us. Perhaps we can minimize and lower it, but whining and complaining about it, however, doesn't help. Yes, we will always need to deal with racism. Yes, what we are asked to endure is unjust. Yes, life for persons of color is unfair. The important question, however, is this, what do we do about it? Each of us must find an answer to that question. And in my case, I feel that the doing is as equally important as the outcome. Lesson number three that I would like to share with you is that people of color will always be primarily responsible for combating racism. This is not fair, but it is reality. If you study the history of racism, you will find that the struggle for equal rights have always come from those who are oppressed. Granted we have valuable White allies and friends and colleagues and they have played a major role in the struggle for civil rights and anti-racism, but it is also clear to me that it is people of color who will always be at the forefront and be giving their lives to speak out against unjust injustice. Without our ability to prick the conscience of White America, it is doubtful that changes would occur. Thus, while we may resent it, it will always play the role, we will always play the role of educator to our White brothers and sisters about racism. Don't let this unfair position and responsibility get you down. Another one, White people can be valuable allies. A very important lesson that I have learned along the way. We need to acknowledge and appreciate the fact that many White Americans are eager to help and represent powerful allies. Many White Americans died during the marches, the civil right marches in the South. It is important for us to realize that our enemy is not White Americans but White supremacy, a form and a belief and an ideology by which all of, ah, White America is inculcated or socialized into. As a group, White Euro-Americans, I believe, are fair and decent-minded. Once they begin to understand their roles, uhm, in oppression and take responsibility for it, when they begin to see themselves as racial cultural beings and understand White privilege, they represent valuable allies. Some of our greatest allies have come from White folks that I'm sure many of you could name. Don't write off people's racially sensitive, insensitive remarks without a cha, a chance for rectification. This is happening quite frequently. Realize that we all need an opportunity to learn and grow. Making insensitive remarks or racial blunders cannot be the sole test of a person's worth and desire to help. All of us are born and raised in a highly racist, sexist and homophobic society. As such, many of us inherit these biases. Helping one another understand the meaning of our words and actions should be one of our primary responsibilities. We must learn to form multicultural alliances. We need to recognize that we need to reach out to one another to form multicultural alliances and realize that race, culture, and ethnicity is a function of each and every one of us. It is not simply a minority thing, a Black thing, an Asian thing, a Native American thing, or a Latino thing. It is also intimately related to White Americans as well. White folks must begin to see that they are also racial cultural beings and have an equal investment in racial/ethnic matters. We must allow them to enter into our world if we are to build bridges of mutual understanding. Any one group alone cannot achieve the struggle for equal rights. Lesson seven, remember that our achievements are not attained, not, ah, attained without the help of many. There is an old African proverb that states that we stand on the heads and shoulders of many who have gone on before us. Our individual and group achievements are the result of a collective effort, not just an individual one. As we are a collective people, it is important to acknowledge that families, friends, neighbors, and our communities have made us who we are. Don't ah, hesitate to ask for help from those who have nourished us through these troubled times. Our strength lies in the group. In some respects, united we stand, separated we fall. Lesson eight we are not immune from inheriting biases and prejudices. People of color also inherit biases and stereotypes of the larger society. Thus, while we demand that Whites must own up to, to their own White racism, we need to also confess our sins as well. I have met Asian-Americans who possess strong stereotypes and prejudices not only against, against Whites, but also against my brothers and sisters of color as well. Likewise, I have encountered brothers and sisters of color who have also expressed negative, uh, negativism toward, uhm, ah, my group. Avoid the "who's more oppressed" trap. Because all oppression is damaging and serves to separate rather than unify, playing the "I'm more oppressed" tra, game is destructive and counterproductive to group unity in combating racism. There is little doubt in my mind that every group whether Asian-American, African-American, Lastino, ah, Latino-Hispanic American or Native American can claim that their groups have suffered immensely from racism. (sniffs) If we understand one, our own group's oppression, shouldn't it make it easier to understand the oppression of others? But to use one group's oppression to negate an, an, another group's oppression is to diminish, dismiss and negate the claims of another. It leads to separation, rather than understanding and mutual collaboration and help. Lesson number ten, don't let interethnic and interracial conflicts destroy our unity. We must face the fact that there is much misunderstanding and bias between groups of color as well. Now, we have, must learn to validate one another's experiences and to credit and appreciate how each has struggled to survive in a racist and oppressive environment. We have submerged our differences primarily because we don't wanna air out dirty laundry or fall into divide-and-conquer trap that, ah, White society seems to enjoy watching, uhm, ah, people of color struggle against one another. While a source of strength in dealing, uhm, with racism, I think, it, it belies the point that there is much misunderstanding that we need to deal with. And so, it is time for us to truly dialogue, ah, and with one group to build bridges of understanding. Asian-Americans have to dialogue with African-American brothers and sisters, with Native Americans, Latino-Americans. We need to begin to work out many of the biases and stereotypes that we may hold towards one another. Lesson number 11, not all bad things that happen to us is due to racism. I have repeatedly emphasized that White supremacy has stripped us of our identity and that it should not diminish our perceptual, uhm, ah, wisdom. While we need to rely and trust our intuitive or experiential reality, it is equally important too that we do not externalize everything. While blaming the victim is psychologically harmful to our identity, it is equally destructive to attribute all negative events in our lives to racism because we fall into the trap that White Americans may fall into and that is that we distort reality. And oftentimes I think we realize it's easier to blame others, ah, and to blame external forces rather than to own up to our own failings and shortcomings or list, uhm, limitations. I like to say that owning up to, uhm, these shortcomings is a sign and, of, of strength, ra, rather than one of weakness. Learn to take care of yourself. Very important. As persons of color, our everyday lives are filled with invalidations that tend to deplete our energies. The drain is even greater for those who choose to actively confront racism and oppression. Working for social justice as an educator, community worker, civil rights advocates means that we are constantly swimming upstream, going against the current. The constant work for social change can cause burnout, feelings of isolation, alienation and what I call psychic drain. All of us need an opportunity to replenish our resources. Learning how to take care of ourselves is very important. Again, let me say that none of us are any good if we burn out, ah, along the way towards, ah, the journey to multiculturalism. Lesson number 13, don't allow yourself to be co-opted by the system. It goes without saying that our lives would be much better if we support the status quo. That's unassailable and most of us know that. One of the ways the system maintains control over us is to punish us if we challenge it, but to reward us if we go along with getting along. All persons of color understand the meaning and the phrase "selling out." I certainly do. Again, being firmly grounded in your values, connected to your community can act as deterrents to being co-opted. Lesson number 14, being bicultural or multicultural is not "selling out." We cannot confuse our bicultural assets with the myth of the melting pot. Being able to function in White society is different from acting White. To be able to function in society means that you are bicultural, that you have not co-opted. We need to realize that there are also acceptable and unacceptable things in all cultures and it's important for us to be able to examine, ah, and accept or reject aspects of cultures based upon social justice merits, not just because they come from one group or another. We need to own and accept those aspects of U.S. culture, for example, that I see as healthy and stand against those which are toxic like racism, sexism, and oppression. I believe that the issue before us is not whether to maintain one way of life, but how can we function in a bicultural manner without losing our sense of integrity. That is actually the question that many people of color wrestle with, day in and day out. Lesson 15, don't allow the current "terrorist atmosphere" to blind us to civil rights issues. Since 9/11, we need to be more vigilant in protecting the civil rights of all. The seeds of prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination have been planted against our law-abiding Muslim brothers and sisters. We must stick together in combating ignorance and prejudice and not la, allow hysteria to dictate our lives. As people of color, we already know how unwarranted fears, racial profiling and stereotypes against whole peoples can have devastating consequences on us. One does not have to look far back to see the consequences of the internment of a hundred and twenty thousand Japanese-Americans, two-thirds by, citizens by virtue of birth who were incarcerated in World War II. The lessons from the past cannot be forgotten. We cannot continue to allow this nation to view racial ethnic minority groups as disloyal aliens in their own country. As people of color, we must constantly step forward to voice opposition, to prejudice and scapegoating. And our actions must be guided by the values of social justice and civil rights. Lastly, being who you are is the best way to combat racism. In some ways, just being a person of color is to combat racism. How we look, what we stand for and our desire to be true to ourselves for society to consider race, racial differences and racism. We are a constant visible reminder to White America about the disparity between its values of equity that they talk about, respect, inclusion, fairness, freedom, and civil rights and its racist policies and practices, disrespect, exclusion, oppression, and White privilege. That's why our visibility whether it is racial, ethnic or cultural is enough to engender feelings of guilt, anger, hatred and discomfort among many of our White brothers and sisters. Until our nation begins to see racial and, the cu, racial(ph) and cultural mosaic of our society as something beautiful and valued, our presence will always represent a stand against racism. And as I end this presentation, ah, this morning, I want to just tell my brothers and sisters of color and also our White allies to keep on keeping on. Thank you very much.
