RICH SIMON Welcome everyone. Here we are again at a Networker webcast. My name is Rich Simon and in this webcast series we're looking at this question of what at the most immediate practical level, what are the challenges that therapists most often report themselves facing in their practices. And we're very fortunate today to have as our guest someone who has looked very closely and written very practically and presented around the country on this question of resistance. What is it that we mean by resistance and what are some of the ways that we can be misled by this concept of resistance and we'll be exploring that today with Cliff Mitchell. Cliff, welcome. How are ya? 

00:01:05
CLIFF MITCHELL Good Rich. How are you? 

00:01:05
RICH SIMON OK. I, I'm, I hope I'm not going to be encountering any resistance in this interview. 

00:01:10
CLIFF MITCHELL I hope not also. 

00:01:10
RICH SIMON All right, and I know you'll overcome whatever resistance I might offer I'm sure. Uh, so, let, let's start this off. So you're, um, you begin with the premise that often, uh, that we have a fundamental misunderstanding, many therapists do, about the nature of resistance. What is it that we mean by that term? So start us off, what is it that people, uh, that practitioners often don't understand about "resistance" in psychotherapy? 

00:01:45
CLIFF MITCHELL Well it's, it's some of what we don't understand is because of how we've been taught and how the definition has evolved across time. Uh, early definitions of resistance all stem from Freudian definitions. And as you know Freud said resistance is a class attempt to avoid anxiety-provoking or threatening information. So in the conversation when you get to something a bit threatening that's either provoking, uh, the client resists. Um, they, that's not a bad way to conceptualize resistance, but as you know Freud brought the client in on the couch, they laid them out and the client talked and Freud made his notes and eventually Freud looked at the client and said something about, you know, the reason you have problems is that you didn't get through some, uh, anal or oral stage or resolve your Oedipal Electra complex and that's why you're all messed up. And the client looked at Freud and said I don't agree with that. Well Freud said you're being resistant. Uh, resistance was solely viewed as something in the client. You know, if you're not buying what I'm selling Freud said you're being resistant. And that's where we started 100 years ago. And that's where many definitions, uh, are formed from the beginning. The cognitive therapist would say the client was resistant because of faulty cognitions. The behaviors would say the client is resistant because they did find your reinforcement schedule. Um, all of these definitions are not bad ways of conceptualizing; however, they arouse in our minds words like obstinate, hard-headed, defiant, uh, resistant because we're placing resistance in the client. The social interaction theorists, uh, have evolved in about the last 40 years in the literature and they say resistance is a result of the negative interpersonal interaction between the client and the therapist. And this is a major paradigm shift in our view of resistance. We've taken resistance out of the client and said no it's not in the client, it's something that is co-created in the interaction style of the client and the therapist and that this perspective, uh, empowers therapists to do more to resolve resistance because we're part of the equation. It also challenges us to find new more clever creative ways to manage the conversation and what arises in the conversation that we're labeling as resistance. So the, the fault we have that is still too prevalent is viewing resistance as something in the client instead of saying hold it, what is my part in co-creation of the resistance and what do I need to do to manage the resistance. 

00:04:30
RICH SIMON And so... 

00:04:30
CLIFF MITCHELL (crosstalk)I...go ahead. 

00:04:35
RICH SIMON if you idle this, you know, the idea is it's empowering for the therapist to think of themselves as what am I doing to create and foster "resistance" in my client. 

00:04:45
CLIFF MITCHELL Yes. 

00:04:45
RICH SIMON OK. 

00:04:45
CLIFF MITCHELL And I don't like the word resistance but we're stuck with it. 

00:04:50
RICH SIMON And yet we have quotation marks for the purposes at least of this conversation. 

00:04:55
CLIFF MITCHELL Yes. 

00:04:55
RICH SIMON We have quotation marks. 

00:04:55
CLIFF MITCHELL Yes. 

00:04:55
RICH SIMON OK. OK, so, um, so as you do your training, it sounds like you have a number, you, you've, uh, developed a number of ways that both, uh, helping people, helping therapists to grasp this concept to really, uh, operationalize this notion of a different way of thinking about resistance and more importantly moving so that therapy is more effective, that the relationship, uh, leads more easily to the client getting where the client wants to go. So one, one of the things that you, uh, talk about is the, these essential ingredients about person, place, and time. Talk to us about that. Why is that, what do you mean by that and why is that such an essential ingredient in psychotherapy? 

00:05:45
CLIFF MITCHELL I love this simple concept. And I will be honest. I stole this concept from David Burns, the cognitive therapist. Uh, David Burns was presenting and he said, uh, he said we don't ever help the client until the problem is followed down to the point that you and client can both name a person, place, and time event that you're talking about. And I wrote that down and I said, wow that's an interesting concept and I've watched many, many counseling sessions every year. I have never been able to disprove this. So the client walks in and they rarely have one problem. You know, the dog died, my son is on drugs, my daughter is pregnant, my husband is an alcoholic truck driver, he's on the road out having an affair, I'm thinking about getting divorced, my mother is in the nursing home, she's dying, I don't have enough money to pay you, can you help me? And they walk in with this, this slew of problems. I have not met a counselor/therapist in the modern times that had a one-problem client. They don't exist. Well that's too broad, too big, too amorphous to deal with so you need to start filing this down. The first thing you do is you can't work on all those problems at once. You need to grab one of those problems, I always seem to have the client choose the problem they want to work on, um, and after the client picks a problem to work on you bring that problem into the therapy session. But that's still too big and broad. You must take that problem and funnel it down to a person, place, and time event where you and the client can both name the person, place, and time. When you have reached that point you have something that is manageable that you can do something with, and until you reach that point you're probably too broad, too vague, too amorphous and you feel like you're struggling; you have resistance. You don't have resistance, you haven't funneled the problem to a manageable event. And I can tell you the person, place, and time, maybe someone ten years ago that abused this person. It may be the husband, the wife, the boss, the kids, the neighbors at a particular point in their action. It could be you and the client sitting there at this moment because as we all know, what's happening between the therapist and the client is typically what's happening between the client and the rest of the world. Sometimes you don't have to go out there to get a person, place, or time. We are part of the person, place, and time. It's what is happening at this moment. And so when we funnel problems to that point they're manageable and we start resolving and dissolving resistance because we've got something we can do something with. 

00:08:25
RICH SIMON I see... 

00:08:25
CLIFF MITCHELL (crosstalk)Yea, go ahead. 

00:08:30
RICH SIMON The depression isn't a problem that you can work on. Anxiety is not a problem you can work on until you, or existential despair is not a problem you can work on until you, uh, define it down, until you focus it down in a way you have described. 

00:08:50
CLIFF MITCHELL Precisely. If I just say help my depression, what does that mean? What, what are you gonna do? Uh, and I'll tell you there's a person, place, and time with depression. Typically when you're laying in the bed in the morning trying to get out of bed, uh, the client is the person, the time is the morning, and the place is the bed. What happens at that moment? How do you manage that moment is gonna, you know, managing those moments is critical to the therapeutic outcome. 

00:09:15
RICH SIMON OK. All right. So now, so that, so one thing is the amorphousness of problem definition. 

00:09:25
CLIFF MITCHELL Yes, very good. That's a good word. 

00:09:25
RICH SIMON Until, until the clock is ticking, until we have the space time coordinates down we can't really begin to do effective work. 

00:09:35
CLIFF MITCHELL And that's a great point. And master therapists, and good therapists will do this naturally. But some clients are masters of avoiding, uh, allowing you to funnel it down because as you funnel it down more responsibility naturally moves to the client and you have to be ready to manage that when that occurs. 

00:09:50
RICH SIMON OK. All right. And that's a big issue I will get to in a moment. But there's other thing that your, uh, that you make a big deal of and one of the first things you talk about is what we have a problem when we want to become the, when we assume the identity of the big shot experts. 

00:10:10
CLIFF MITCHELL Yes. 

00:10:10
RICH SIMON One of the, one of the real invitations for a fall for therapists is when you get to be, uh, adopt an expert stance in relationships with, uh, your clients. Talk to us about that. What do you mean? What's wrong with being an expert? Isn't that what we're paid for? 

00:10:25
CLIFF MITCHELL Well, it is what we're paid for but ideally we're gonna be an expert at the interaction and not the expert so much on the client's problems. There's a paradox that happens with clients and their problems. The client comes in and they've got hosts of problems. We're listening to these problems. We've actually heard these problems probably once already this week and several times this month and a number of this year and they're not seeming to do anything and we're sitting there and we're talking to ourselves saying, if they would just do something and change something somewhere they'd make some progress. But they're, they're stagnant in their patterns and so we in our attempt to get something done start offering suggestions to the client. Perhaps you might try this or do this or do that and the client yes, buts us. We get yes, but. Now, when you get the yes, but response what is happening is this, you have moved into an expert position relative to the client's problems and the client doesn't want you in an expert position. The signal back to you that they don't want you in an expert position is yes, but. 

00:11:40
RICH SIMON But, OK. 

00:11:45
CLIFF MITCHELL And so this says get out of the expert position because it's not working in the therapeutic interaction at the moment. So what you have to do in this case is reverse the paradox. If the client is not buying what you're selling or taking your suggestions, instead of becoming the expert, which is not working, you should become naive, puzzled, curious, unknowing; in essence dumb down. Get out of the expert position because it's not working at the moment in the interaction and move to a point where the client has to do more explaining and talking to you. If they're talking they're working or if we're talking we're working. We want them working. The expert position is us taking responsibility for the problem and indirectly enhancing the very thing we don't want. And in the book and in many texts they call this the Columbo technique. As you know Columbo was a disheveled... 

00:12:40
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)As we are doing this we know Columbo, but is, so I'm, uh, let's, let's how does that sound? If you can, so how, when you take the Columbo, and we all remember Columbo, uh, and uh, I'm sorry I stepped on your, uh, saying a little bit about Columbo. I will, I think I stepped on your nice description. 

00:13:05
CLIFF MITCHELL That's all right. 

00:13:05
RICH SIMON OK. 

00:13:05
CLIFF MITCHELL So you want to go ahead and do it over? 

00:13:05
RICH SIMON Give us, if you could, a little demonstration of how you, how you portray Columbo in your own practice. So what is Columbo and how does it sound when you become Columbo in your work with your clients? 

00:13:20
CLIFF MITCHELL OK. Well Columbo, as you know, is a fumbling, bumbling, disheveled looking detective that always, uh, acted like he didn't know what was going on relative to the murder. And it's through his, coming from this, uh, unknowing position he would always ask questions and he would get the murderer to reveal themselves because they played him for a chump. He looks like he was two steps behind the murderer. In reality he was three steps ahead. He got the murderer to reveal himself by not being so smart. Now when going through this same thing in counseling and therapy when we're talking with the client, we're sitting there and say we suggest something, well have you tried this or perhaps if you tried this and the client comes back with, yes, but if I do that I do that then I'll run into this and well if I do this then I've got the problem of this; just nothing will work. Now at that point you should get out of knowing and you move to not knowing and you say something to the affect of boy, as we're sitting here it really is difficult to even begin to grasp the first step you might take to do something about the situation you're in. And you should become also unknowing, puzzled, and sit with the not knowing position and kinda look dumb myself. I play with my eyelids to get that dumb look on your face and stay with it. Stay with it. Stay with the not knowing. At the same time you're gonna be very clever with your wording and suggest that it's very difficult to imagine. The very first step that you might take to begin to manage the problem so at the same time you're indirectly, your having embedded suggestion leading the client to where they, what you want them to do to imagine it while you become quiet and naive. Now, I can tell you I've done this a number of times and it is amazing many times it works. You suggest not knowing and the client moves to knowing. When you're in knowing they yes, but you. So if yes, butting is not working get out of it, go to not knowing, dumb down. Uh, and I can tell you, uh, what we were talking about a little bit earlier before we started. Uh, it is not how much you want to help that determines the outcome. It is not knowledge you have of the problem and possible solutions that determines the outcome. Therapeutic outcomes are determined by if, uh, the therapeutic relationship is working or not. The question you should be asking yourself constantly is, is this therapeutic conversation working? And when the client is yes, butting you, it's not working so we must move from not working to some other form of working. That's what's critical to therapeutic outcomes. 

00:16:35
RICH SIMON Uh-huh. OK. So let's stay a little bit with this, this idea. I'm trying to get the music of this, of the Columbo idea and then. So I'm a client and let's say we've gotten it down. I'm depressed, I can't get myself out of bed in the morning, um, I'm at a loss to think about how I can do something. I've come to you for help. Um, I'm uh, feeling quite passive about my life. I'm just overwhelmed with the sense of my own incompetency, I just can't, I can't deal with coming out of bed, uh, getting out of bed in the morning so the track is for you to begin to give me some cognitive behavioral situations and tips. 

00:17:20
CLIFF MITCHELL Yes. 

00:17:20
RICH SIMON So instead of that, if this is the case, if I'm that kind of a client, give me a, if you can give me a little bit of the sound of how, of where you might take it and then maybe coach me a little bit in the kind of way I might respond, uh, in the client once you're not so expert about my problem. 

00:17:40
CLIFF MITCHELL OK. There's a step that comes before this though and we're probably gonna have to talk about it here. Uh, if the clients come to you and you're still up here in the vague world, in the broad amorphous world, the first thing you do is get lots of details. Lots of information. Before you even move to the what to do, uh, when I say details, I wanna know, tell me what you did this morning when you woke up. Help me to know exactly what you did. Did you lay there 20 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour? Did you immediately get out of bed? Did you, uh, go for a walk? Did you sit and read the, the paper or go sit down and hear all the negative news? I wanna know, uh, at the micro level what you did. I want to know what you did. I want to know how you were feeling when you did that. And I want to know what you were thinking when you did that. So I want to gather lots of information and lots of details about what the client is doing. And I'll tell you why, and I'm gonna have to talk a little bit to explain this. 

00:18:45
RICH SIMON OK. 

00:18:45
CLIFF MITCHELL The devil is in the details and so are solutions. Solutions are not in the broad scope, solutions are in the details. Every therapist that's ever had a successful client relationship or helped the client did it because they got to a detail in the client's life, in their patterns of behavior. They, they were able to disrupt that pattern at the detailed level and replace it with another pattern and change the client in some way whether it was a perception, a thought, a feeling. So the devil is in the details and so are the solutions. And I, uh, the other point about this is details creates options. I was teaching reality therapy one time and to make a long story short we, we had the students all keep doing reality therapy with each other and I would ask them, I was going around listening and I would say what's the goal? And a number of the students said the goal is diet. And I said diet? Diet's not a goal. I don't wanna know how big the plate is, I wanna know what food is on the plate, how big are the portions, when are you gonna eat, when are you gonna exercise. Get me some details. And when this was over one of my students was processing what had occurred and they said let me tell you what happened. My therapist was pressing me for details and I all of a sudden realized every time I provided a detail I had an option. I had a choice. And this light bulb goes off. Details create options. Details create choices. If you and the client are not recognizing enough options or choices, you don't have enough details about what the thinking, feeling, and doing in the minutiae. So, the first client comes to you but first thing before you even move to, uh, one of these positions is don't try to fix, don't try to suggest, try to learn in great detail into the minutiae about their life, their world, what they're doing, what they're thinking, what they're feeling. Somewhere in that minutiae as you are sitting, listening, gathering, gathering, gathering information, uh, hopefully, and many times I think you do, you get a morsel. You get something that you know motivates the client and you go into that point and you start disrupting wherever you can. You disrupt the pattern wherever you can disrupt the pattern, not necessarily where we want to disrupt the pattern but when the client gives you an opening to disrupt the pattern. So the first thing that I'm gonna do with a depressed client is get the details. And during this detail time I'm going to be dumb. I am not gonna be the expert. I'm gonna be sitting there, uh, and tell me and I'm gonna be doing this by the way. I'm gonna draw them, and tell me more about that and tell me this and the whole time I'm looking for that point to get in there and disrupt the pattern. Which is what all of the master expert therapists do. They, they come in at conventions like yours and they demonstrate and they gather information and gather information and gather information and then they see that place where they can go in with their favorite therapeutic technique or their theory that they wrote in a book and when they find that place that they can surgically go in with their technique, that's when they really dig in and go for details. Then they apply their technique, disrupt the patterns, and, uh, do their thing to disrupt that pattern. But until they get to that point they are gathering information in the minutiae so they can get in there and strike, uh, when they get a chance with their favorite technique. 

00:22:25
RICH SIMON So in this case, so I, I'm really getting a sense of, of how you work and how this process works. So let's say I'm the depressed client and you've gotten how many times I go back to sleep in the morning and I can't get up, I'll go to the bathroom and then I go back to sleep and you know all that. So, what would be the example of getting a detail that you feel from your experience with working with my kind of a client that that's the kind of thing where I want to begin to focus in? 

00:22:55
CLIFF MITCHELL OK. 

00:22:55
RICH SIMON What would be an example of how you shifted the gear once you begin this stage that you've described? 

00:23:00
CLIFF MITCHELL The detail I want is going to be a piece of information that the client has an irritating emotion about. Because I'm looking for an emotionally compelling reason to change. So when that client is talking to me they're gonna give me a morsel. They're gonna say, you know that's the one thing about this I'm a little upset with myself. I wish I would've done that a little bit differently. Or, that's the thing, you know, well you know I feel like I can't do anything, you know, that's the one place I'd really like to change what I'm doing. They're gonna almost as a pregnant passing statement talk about something that's really bothering them. And what I find, the emotional thing that's irritating them, that's where you want to dig in. And in good counseling and therapy when we find the emotionally troubling part we don't diminish it, we want to initially magnify the emotion. Uh, increase the level of discomfort. Uh, talk about that level of discomfort. And, and because that's what's gonna get that client motivated to do something. So if they're laying in bed and they're not getting out of bed and it comes 10, 11, 12 o'clock in the morning, and by the way, I'm waiting for them to give me a morsel of, yea you know I was really pissed at myself, I'm gonna pick up on pissed at myself. Tell me about you being pissed at yourself. Oh, so irritated, you know, I feel like I wasted the day. OK. And so I'm gonna grow that up. I'm gonna feed that irritation because that's gonna be a motivator in a detail... 

00:24:40
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Can you tell more about how you would do it? So I give you that information and I just, I just, ah, I just wasted the whole morning, I just kept going back to sleep. Ah, that's, you know, that's where I'm stuck doc. Where, where do you go with that? So how might it sound? 

00:25:00
CLIFF MITCHELL The first thing is, boy you're pissed at yourself. You sound very irritated that you didn't do more to help yourself get up and get going in the day. At least get cranked up and do something that would have been of more benefit. I'm gonna see what the client says. Usually you can find something. Uh, I'm gonna, I'm not gonna run from that emotion. I'm gonna dig into it and I'm gonna magnify it. 

00:25:25
RICH SIMON Enhance it. OK. 

00:25:30
CLIFF MITCHELL Yes, yes. We don't want to diminish it initially. 

00:25:30
RICH SIMON Right. 

00:25:30
CLIFF MITCHELL In fact, there is some research out there somewhere that says in good counseling and therapy one of the first things we do is enhance and magnify and clarify a negative emotion. Uh, the root of change, change results from a crystallization of discontent. So I'm gonna want to crystallize the discontent initially. 

00:25:55
RICH SIMON Yep. And one of the things you say, and I really like this phrase that you use to describe the, the thing that you are looking for and, uh, I think you make, we've talked about this in the past, where the, uh, the prime reason that therapy bogs down is that the, we haven't discovered and, and come up with, uh, haven't focused in on the client's emotionally compelling reason to change. Talk to us about that. Why that is so important. 

00:26:30
CLIFF MITCHELL Well it, it's the, uh, it's the vital ingredient for all counseling and therapy to be successful. Uh, I personally believe, uh, people generally don't change simply because of logic. If people changed because of logic nobody would drink, nobody would smoke, nobody would ever try to outrun a yellow light or a train. If they changed because of logic they wouldn't drive down the road and talk in their car on the cell phone at the same time, especially up in D.C. where you are. My gosh. But you know we wouldn't eat the junk food and all these machines and we would get eight hours of sleep and all have an exercise program. But people don't do that stuff even though we know better. Now when do people get a hold of their smoking habit, their drinking habit? Well they've got to have an emotionally compelling reason. They've got to have a reason that stirs them emotionally. I can sit and talk to clients all day long about the logic or the bad logic of what they're doing, but they already know that. They know that walking in the door. So, uh, one of the things I say we're looking for an emotionally compelling reason to change. Now how do you find that? Let's talk about the how to method. You use good ole' Rogerian empathic statements, and a well-phrased empathic statement is gonna have emotion in it. You're gonna label an emotion. So when you're talking to the client and going into the details, you want to constantly empathize with those details and tap into the emotion that is occurring while you're talking with the client gathering the details looking for the one that really triggers something. Looking for an emotionally compelling reason to change. I'll give and example. I had a student one time sitting in a, a practical internship class. And he walked in and he said, I'm gonna quit smoking. And he's heard me and knows all of my points and principles, and I said, something's happened in your life. You have an emotionally compelling reason. He said yes, my wife is pregnant. I'm gonna be a father. Now he knew he shouldn't have smoked for years but nothing made it, he didn't stop. But now, I'm gonna be a father, now I have an emotionally compelling reason. And now he's saying I quit smoking. Uh, something happened that triggered it and I'm gonna tap in to fatherhood with him big time. Of course, I don't need to. He's already found his emotionally compelling reason to change. So I personally believe what looks like resistance to many therapists is the fact that they haven't tapped into an emotionally compelling reason to change. Uh, when you have that the client is ready to go. If you're sitting there trying to talk them into changing with logic, my gosh you can bog down and waste some time. And I think much therapeutic time is literally wasted trying to work with logic to get people to change. Uh, you'd be much better off, uh, digging into something that can, uh, fire up some emotion. 

00:29:45
RICH SIMON And so, and then the other thing that you seem to emphasize is we're good-hearted folks, we care, we want to help people out so that when the therapist gets in the way of the process it's we're too helpful and too nurturing. 

00:30:00
CLIFF MITCHELL Oh yea. 

00:30:00
RICH SIMON So how does, so what does that sound like? 

00:30:05
CLIFF MITCHELL Oh that sounds like many, many things. We do it in many, many ways. Um, we uh, we take on the problem for ourselves and we can do this in so many subtle ways. It's just, uh, amazing. In my book I talk about accepting the invitation to take the pain. And I make the point that all clients will in some way or another, in some form or another, invite you to take their pain. They may make a comment to you like did I make the right decision, what do you think I should do, or they may cry in your office hoping that you're gonna pick up that, those tears almost. Now there's nothing wrong with clients coming in and emotionally dumping. That's a wonderful thing we do for them. Uh, but when they dump out that emotion, we need to be very careful not to pick it up. That's their pain. Uh, the client's pain is the client's motivation for them to do something about their life. We need to make sure that pain stays with the client and we don't indirectly start accepting responsibility to do it. Now when you move into an expert position, you are indirectly sending a message to the client I can fix this, here's, you know, I'm taking responsibility for this. Uh, it's a subtle message. If you look at the client and say, uh, boy we need to see what we can do about this. How can we solve this problem. Guess what? You've just turned the counseling session into a group project, and if you've ever done group projects in school, most people despise and hate group projects and they do it because of the freeloaders that didn't participate and got the same grade you got and they didn't do any work. So when you start saying we and what can we do about this, you turn it to a group project. And the client that's unmotivated or the resistant involuntary unmotivated client is going to be the freeloader. And all of a sudden you're working harder than them in the counseling session, uh, because we gotta see what we can do about this. We is actually a, a very difficult word and actually we should be very careful with using it because we takes responsibility away from the client. We, uh, puts the therapist in a more active position to help resolve the problem. It really misrepresents the therapeutic relationship because the bottom line is we can't make our clients change. They have to decide what they're gonna change. We can coach them and hopefully talk to them and get them in touch with motivators for change, but we can't do it. So why are we saying we've gotta solve this? By the way, I have enough problems of my own, I don't want their problems. Uh, and I want to make sure that their problem is their problem. So we can accept the invitation to take the pain by moving to an expert position, offering too many suggestions, saying the word we, uh, many subtle cues send this message to the client. Then the client starts stagnating. They're going nowhere and we wonder why we're getting resistance. We don't realize that we're part of the equation. 

00:33:30
RICH SIMON Yea, yea. 

00:33:30
CLIFF MITCHELL We, we're accepting the pain of the client and the client is saying you take this pain, you try to fix it. I had students at practicum, I had one one time at every session the client would look at the student in practicum and say do you think I did the right thing. And when we would come out of that session I would say, did you hear that? There's an invitation to take this pain, the agony of deciding for myself. I don't want to have the burden of this decision and I would tell the student, be very careful how you respond at that point. Uh, do not say yes or no whatever you do. Send the client into analyzing, discussing their own choice and keep the ownership with the client because it's the client's problem. If you take that responsibility you're going to be accepting the invitation to take the pain and before they know it they'll hand it all to you. 

00:34:25
RICH SIMON So, so given what you've told us so far, it seems like you, one of the, um, really important assessments that the therapist does is, and which may affect everything that you, that we've just been talking about is this notion about the Prochaska's famous stages of change. 

00:34:50
CLIFF MITCHELL Yes. 

00:34:50
RICH SIMON We'll move precontemplative on and to the people who are much more action oriented. So how do you incorporate that notion of stages of change, this rather, uh, for many of us a rather abstract idea, into the practicalities of how you work with your various clients and decide what to do what with whom. 

00:35:10
CLIFF MITCHELL Well, let me say that right off the stage of change theory, the motivational interviewing material is something that everybody should learn and have some knowledge of. Prochaska and his colleagues said people most of the time do not change instantly. Even though they can, uh, it's a rare occurrence and your resistant unmotivated involuntary client is not one who changes instantly so they go through these stages. Um, we probably don't have time right now to directly talk about, unless you want to, about the characteristics of the stages, but we have the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and somehow a termination. 

00:35:50
RICH SIMON Slow that down for a moment and just say a few words about each of those. I think most of us are somewhat familiar here, but, uh, if you could just quickly go through them and say how does that affect the, the style of intervention you have been describing here. 

00:36:00
CLIFF MITCHELL Excellent point. Precontemplators come to you. These are people who are unaware or are under-aware that they even have a problem. They're typically the person that the boss or the husband or the wife or the court or the principal has sent to you and said fix this person. Uh, they show up because of pressure from the outside. When the pressure from the outside goes away, so do they usually. So, uh, we say they are in a state of denial. They're not even aware they have a problem. Um, and most traditional therapeutic techniques were not even designed to deal with precontemplators because they were designed to be used for a person that comes to you and says I have a problem, help me with the problem. This is a person who comes to you and says I don't have a problem, I don't know why they sent me to you. Uh, now what are you gonna do? So they're in a, a state of, of a lack of awareness. Uh, they typically say something like, you know, uh, I may have some things I need to work on but really if all of these other people would just quit bugging me and get off my back, uh, things would be OK. Now, my favorite generalized approach in dealing with the precontemplator is to work from this theme; tell me how this is a problem for you. Uh, your position should be one of again, naivety, unknowing. Uh, how is this a problem for you? Tell me what's going on that this is a problem for you. You want to first define how the problem is a problem from the client's perspective. And they say, well I can't get these people off my back and my wife's nagging me and I'm gonna go to jail if I don't get something done here. And again in that we're going to go into great minutiae detail and look for an emotionally compelling reason to change. If you go parental, you start lecturing and you start telling a precontemplator the logic or not drinking or doing drugs and the logic of this, you're gonna run into a brick wall big time because they've failed to move to a position of even recognizing a problem. So we become even more naive, more puzzled and again work from the theme of tell me how this is a problem for you. I'm dumb over here and I want you to form up a problem for me. Even if it's obvious. Uh, you know how I would jokingly say tell me how this is a problem for you, these 11 DUIs you have had. You know I wouldn't say that, but I'm gonna be naive like that. If I go parental, I'm dead in the water. If I start lecturing I'm gonna be dead in the water. This person does not want me to approach with that position, so it's very important to stay out of that position. Then you move to your contemplators. Contemplators recognize there is a problem, but they're in a profound state of ambivalence. The benefits and the drawbacks and the yins and the yans and the pros and the cons of the change has them in torment. They say I have a problem I think I should work on, the operative word being think, not work on. All they do is think about it. Your precontemplator is a master at avoidance. Your contemplator is a master of procrastination. So what do you do to your contemplator? Well you want to send them into the conflict. Use your thought techniques, empty chairs, parts talking to each other, and discussions of yes if you do you're gonna lose this and you gain this. What a struggle. You don't tell them what to do, you send them into a discussion. You send them into that, uh, ambivalence hoping that they'll start resolving it. Uh, your job is not to fix them and change them, your job is to direct them into managing the ambivalence hopefully, uh, to the point that they'll resolve it. And because they know there's a problem. Then you move to your preparation stage client. Now this is a wonderful client to get. They know there is a problem. They're wanting to change the problem. They've already been to the attorney about the divorce. They've joined the gym to help with exercise and diet program. They've read the self-help book. Uh, they went online and went to Rich Simon's website and started reading about their problem from some expert and they've studied it. They even came to you on their own, uh, saying help me. Now this is the client that you can start moving in with your traditional techniques very strongly because they're wanting support. They're wanting someone, show me what to do to move to the next step. You can move much more directive with your preparation stage client cause they say hey, I'm ready to go. Support me, and they're gonna be much more open to suggestion than, by the way, here's where you can move towards the expert position because they're saying I'm primed and ready to go. I want your expertise to move me to the next step. Now until you reach that stage you want to be very careful about that expertise. Uh, and I didn't say this but let me say there is nothing wrong with being in an expert position if the client is buying what you're selling. If you have a good idea that they'll take it and try it, well tell them. But the good idea when you suggest it and they reject it, get out of there, it's not working. But the preparation stage client, they're wonderful clients to get and move to the next stage which is action and that's where they'll actually, they stop drinking, they stop smoking, they got the divorce, they changed the job, they started the exercise program, they did what they needed to do about their grief, and then so action stage is where they take, uh, here you want to stay right with them using all your techniques to keep them motivated moving to maintenance. Now maintenance, it's important to remember, is not, does not mean completion. Maintenance is a very active stage or actively working to maintain the changes that have been made. Everybody in drug and alcohol is fully aware of this. You can't let it go simply because the change has been implemented. So in maintenance, again, you're supporting, you're coaching, you're finding out what's working, you're reinforcing them. Uh, and here again, uh, you may want to be careful. If they're doing it on their own, you don't want to jump in there as an expert, you just want to say wow, you're doing great. Sounds like you've got it down. Um, stay out of the expert position and let them feel good about their change. So resistance, then, if we want to take it back to that, many times is a result of the therapist approaching the client the wrong way relative to the stage of change they're in. If I take a precontemplator and a contemplator, which is where all of your resistance is usually, and I try to push them quickly to action, I am creating resistance. I'm part of the resistance equation. And I'll tell you what Prochaska said to me. He said, uh, the problem, and this is a problem, this is a wonderful problem we're facing, is that therapists in the world does not realize that the real work is done at the precontemplative and contemplative stages where you don't see anything on the outside. The mistake is to think that the work is being done in action stage. Action stage, uh, is much easier to manage than the precontemplators and the contemplators. So when a client walks in in a contemplative or precontemplative stage, uh, and you don't see on the outside any visible signs of change, uh, we start thinking boy they're resistant, they're not going anywhere. No, they're not necessarily, they are in an early stage of change where the struggle is internal. And it is our job to recognize, hey, the struggle here is internal. Just because I do not see anything definitively being done, uh, action-wise in the client's life doesn't mean there's no work. And Prochaska says, no, this is where the real work is done but nobody gets to see anything and as therapists we need to recognize that. No, I'm doing the tough work, but the real work is, uh, doesn't get us the same results. And, and we'll create resistance if we don't realize that. 

00:44:15
RICH SIMON So, so let me ask you something. As focus for a moment though, if that's much of the work of therapy is in these early two stages and not getting ahead of our clients and not mistaking what, uh, stage of change and readiness for change there in, so when we move into these later stages, is, where's the resistance within people who have that attitude towards change? 

00:44:45
CLIFF MITCHELL Well, ideally in the later stages, we don't have, uh, much resistance if things are moving along. Uh, now, you can get resistance, but it shows up in a different way. Uh, they start doubting they can maintain. The divorced person says oh my gosh, I'm so lonely, I want to go back to this person who is horrible, or the smoker sitting there going gee I don't know how long I can put up without a cigarette and the drinker or the drug addict is doubting whether they can maintain the changes so the resistance is in a self-doubt many times or gee, can I make it and so you become a supportive person, a cheerleader, you point out, hey, you are doing it now. Uh, you shift, uh, the resistance has shifted to another style of doubt, of hesitancy, and you have to shift appropriately in how you are responding to it. You may become, uh, a more active supportive role where before you don't appear too supportive because it's gonna show a sign of taking on the problem. Here you may move to a supportive role if it's working with a client because that's what they need. So it shows up in a different style later. 

00:46:05
RICH SIMON So one of the things you... 

00:46:05
CLIFF MITCHELL (crosstalk)A different dynamic. 

00:46:05
RICH SIMON A different dynamic. 

00:46:05
CLIFF MITCHELL Yea. 

00:46:05
RICH SIMON And so one of the things you also talk about is the, um, there are certain cognitions, attitudes on the part of the therapist here cause you're, you're notion of resistance is largely, uh, it's the mismatch between the therapist's intervention, the, um, misperception of where the client is in the change process, so, uh, one of the things you talk about are there certain distorting beliefs that lead therapists to trigger as we were talking about, that create and foster resistance in their clients. What's, what do you mean by that? What are the nature, what are these cognitive distortions that give us that? 

00:46:50
CLIFF MITCHELL Yea. Well as therapists we have cognitive distortions just like our clients do. We, we see the therapeutic processes a certain way and we have cognitions about that. We need to be careful that we don't inadvertently create resistance because of our own distortions. For example, uh, therapist says my client doesn't want to change or my clients don't want to change or my client shouldn't be ambivalent about change or they feel their client should be easy to work with, uh, well no. The truth of the matter is yea, they don't want to change, that's why they're clients. If they wanted to change they probably wouldn't be seeing you, uh, they would go do it on their own or they would come in as a precontemplator and be really primed to do it, but most of them don't. Most of the clients walk in the door in a precontemplator or contemplative stage. So we have to be careful that we don't view our clients in a way that is just unrealistic. The truth of the matter is, all clients are ambivalent about change. I'm ambivalent about change. You're ambivalent about change. When somebody wants us to change, uh, the initial reaction many times is no, I like the way it is. I've been working for years to get it here. So what's the truth? All clients are ambivalent about change and that is a fact of all counseling and therapy. Um, and it's not necessarily that you can present a stronger argument to motivate them to change. Uh, you're gonna have to find their own emotionally compelling reason to change. Uh, it's not you. It's the very nature of the business that it may be slow. It may be walking in the mush in the (inaudible) with the client. Uh, another one would be, uh, that it's beneficial, and we've talked about this, to, uh, remove the client's distress. It's beneficial to, my job is to make my client's feel better though not necessarily. As I noted, the client's pain is the client's motivation to change. As Albert Ellis, the late Albert Ellis, was fond of saying, feeling better doesn't equal getting better. You can feel better and still be doing the same negative patterns of thinking and feeling and acting and, and you'll be back where you were if all you did is temporarily feel better. Sometimes you have these clients come in and we get into these patterns and the client comes in every week and we feel like we are band aiding them or patching them up to get through the week. Uh, and the clients love this because you're kind of their, their weekly support. But if they are not doing any definitive change you need to step back and say hold it, am I part of this stagnation? Have I accepted the invitation of the pain? Have I focused too much on the client feeling better immediately and not on a long term change in their life? Uh, so, uh, getting the clients to necessarily feel better can be beneficial or negative depending on the consequence so we have to be careful, uh, how we treat the client's pain. Another one would be that the client should be working as hard as I'm working, or my job is my life, if I fail in this situation I'm a failure. My clients aren't getting better. I'm no good. Um, the responsibility for change in the client's. And if we start taking on too much of this responsibility again we could be fostering resistance and fostering the lack of change that's coming. Uh, it's very important to realize that our job and the client's job are different. The client's job is to find what to do to change and to change. Our job is to enter into a dialog with the client and through the dialog we send the client into the difficult issues, their ambivalence, their struggles, so they can resolve their struggles. But it's not my job to make this client change. 

00:51:05
RICH SIMON Yep. 

00:51:10
CLIFF MITCHELL We can't make our clients change. In fact, we look at people all the time in the therapy session and we say something like, you can't change other people, you can only change yourself, which is a very common therapeutic statement. But then we walk into the session with a treatment plan saying I gotta change this person this session, I got an in-treatment plan right here. But hold it. You just told the client you can't change other people. Doesn't that apply to us also? We can't change our clients. We can only change how we interact with our clients hoping that will result in change. So when we realize, I can't change this person, I can hopefully interact with them in a way that finds their own internal motivators in the minutiae of their life that will result in them changing. So my job is to not make them change my job is to help them find their own motivators for change. We need to realize our job and the client's job are different in the session. 

00:52:10
RICH SIMON That's nicely put. Now one of the things you emphasize in this process, in this kind of dance about who, who's leading and it is a very subtle dance as you discussed... 

00:52:25
CLIFF MITCHELL (crosstalk)Oh yes. 

00:52:25
RICH SIMON When you are getting us to the intricacies of it. So sometimes in this dance, uh, in your view it's really important that you change the dance without, uh, the client knowing in advance what you are gonna do. Do the unexpected. 

00:52:40
CLIFF MITCHELL Oh yes. 

00:52:40
RICH SIMON Why is that important and how do you do that? 

00:52:45
CLIFF MITCHELL Well, uh, everything I'm talking about hopefully is to some degree doing the unexpected. Uh, at the, at the basic dialog level, uh, common responses produce common answers. Resistance is fueled by the commonplace. Uh, typical responses and typical statements from you are probably gonna get the same ole statement from the client. I tell my, my, uh, seminar attendees if you're talking to your client you have a little voice in the back of your head up here that says, boy this sounds like something my parents used to say to me, chances are you should shut up. It didn't work for you either, did it? But get out of those common phrases. Again, our purpose is to disrupt patterns. You can't disrupt patterns with the same old patterns. You disrupt patterns by doing the unexpected, doing something different. However, this does not mean that everything you say has to be something profound. A good ole Rogerian empathic statement delivered right when the client says some crazy off the wall bizarre statement that the average person would start arguing with is disrupting a pattern. Um, backing off when you move into the expert position, uh, is not what most people do. When most people move into an expert position and it's not working they push harder. We're gonna push less. We're gonna slow down instead of going faster or we get resistance. Uh, so we want to respect the resistance. When the client says no I don't want to change, we're gonna say yes, you want to stay where you are, and we're gonna embrace it and respect that part of them that's in an internal battle. So all of this is doing the unexpected in one form or another. Uh, if, if we didn't say something different from what the layperson on the street says, why are they coming to see us? We, they're paying us for a conversation. If they're paying $100 an hour for a 50 minute hour, that's a $2 a minute conversation. What makes it worth $2 a minute? Well, one of the things is is you're not gonna say the same things that the average typical person says when the client says something. So we want to always do and think about what I'm gonna do is unexpected and a little bit different because my objective is to disrupt patterns and to do this I must respond out of the typical ways. So everything I shoot for is to, uh, go a different angle than is typically done in lay conversation. 

00:55:40
RICH SIMON So here's what we, we're, uh, almost out of time and, and we want to in a moment, um, alert people, give people information about how they might want to follow up on, on uh, some training opportunities and learn more about this perspective that you've been offering in this very vivid and entertaining way. So let me just ask you, so if you had to, yea, therapy is essentially, it's conversation. 

00:56:05
CLIFF MITCHELL Yes. 

00:56:05
RICH SIMON It has that in common in the way we normally make our way through the world. So if you had to, um, pull together this perspective that you've been offering us today, what is, what's distinctive here? What is it that makes the therapeutic conversation any different than the other kinds of conversation, a conversation that you have with our lawyer, with our dentist, with our best friend, with a good nurturing buddy of ours, with our mother. What is it, what's the, um, what's the quality that distinguishes the therapeutic conversation in your view? 

00:56:40
CLIFF MITCHELL Boy that's a beautiful question, and it's, it's probably many things. Let's, let's take it from the beginning. 

00:56:45
RICH SIMON OK. 

00:56:45
CLIFF MITCHELL Um, the first thing, uh, that I believe is gonna separate the therapeutic conversation is this aspect of empathy, good ole Rogerian core conditions. I'm gonna have unconditional powers of regard, I'm gonna respond in an empathic way, I'm gonna be genuine. Now what we do here is we allow the client to tell their story and we respect their story. We're gonna respect their view of the world, their phenomenological view of what's going on. We're gonna respect their cognitions or whatever word you want to use to describe that their internal reality as a reality therapist would say, or whatever, um, and this is vital and critical because with all therapeutic approaches, the purpose is to disrupt patterns in the client's life in some way, shape, or form. But for the client to allow you into their inner psychological world to disrupt patterns, you have to earn the right. And the first thing you do is you listen and respect and you honor their resistance in their world. So one of the things that separates therapy from lay conversation is we know we must spend time earning the right to go into the client's life to disrupt the pattern. And if we push the process we're gonna create resistance. You can't jump in initially and just say do this, do this, do that. No. You haven't earned the right into my world. You haven't earned the right for me to allow you to come in here and start disrupting my patterns. Now some of the grief therapists, uh, DeShazier I believe was one, uh, when the client walked in the door they said tell me what you want and the client wanted to tell the story and it's my understanding that he would say, no, no, no, I don't want to hear your story, just tell me what you want. I don't believe that's gonna work. Uh, you've got to hear my story before I'm gonna let you disrupt patterns. So the first thing is we're gonna respect the client's world and story and that is the first step that's different. Now the next step that's different is ideally we're gonna have many tools and techniques and I don't care what you want to use, cognitive therapy, reality therapy, Rogerian therapy, Gestalt therapy, zip a dee doo dah therapy, just jump in there with some therapy you're good at and you really like and try a different thing that's not typically done by the layperson to disrupt that pattern. I mean laypeople don't say sit here and talk to this anger. Put it in this chair and talk to it. That is not something that comes out of a lay conversation. Uh, laypeople don't sit and try to identify cognitive distortions and politely have the client analyze whether they're true or not. Uh, all of the techniques of all of the theories are different from what people try to do in lay conversation. Most lay conversation is well, you shouldn't do that, you ought to do this, this, da da da, but the person hasn't earned the right to disrupt the pattern and it doesn't work. 

01:00:05
RICH SIMON So one thing, as, as you are talking about this that you're getting at that's a very subtle point is that, uh, it's a basic paradox. That on the one hand it, it, you, this idea of earning the right. The way I get the right to interrupt your patterns that you may be very emotionally attached to that you're describing, I have to earn your trust to disrupt your life. 

01:00:25
CLIFF MITCHELL (crosstalk)Yes. 

01:00:30
RICH SIMON And so, and it seems like you're addressing this aspect of the goals of psychotherapy. The therapists and the clients need to decide on the same goals but what you're saying throughout this conversation here is that at some implicit level the therapist is trying to help the client let go of something, an operating procedure in life. 

01:00:50
CLIFF MITCHELL (crosstalk)Yes. Yes. 

01:00:50
RICH SIMON Certain goals of maintaining the status quo, um, that the client would, is, is not so, is not really sure that, that the contract is a little, you can't make that contract too explicit at the beginning of this process because it's a paradoxical contract in the way you are describing it, isn't it? 

01:01:10
CLIFF MITCHELL Yes. I agree. It's, it's, they don't know, I come to you for help, but we don't say to them, yea, my job is to get you to change the way you're doing things. 

01:01:20
RICH SIMON That's right. 

01:01:20
CLIFF MITCHELL If you say that they're gonna say, hold up I want help but I don't want to have to change anything. 

01:01:25
RICH SIMON Yea. Yea. 

01:01:25
CLIFF MITCHELL So the change has to come about subtly. 

01:01:30
RICH SIMON Yea. 

01:01:30
CLIFF MITCHELL And if we push it too hard we're gonna create resistance. If we allow it to curve from the client and in a more subtle way we don't run into resistance as often. 

01:01:40
RICH SIMON So I think we're gonna end here. And you're, um, very consistent with your framework here without tying up all the loose ends leaving our audience here with paradox and then they will be motivated perhaps to, uh, follow up with you. I would imagine, uh, if they're like me they'd be quite curious about hearing some more of your ideas about therapy and training and so forth. So tell us, Cliff, in terms of if I want to find out more about your particular way of, uh, helping training therapists and helping them deal with resistance, how do I find out about it? 

01:02:15
CLIFF MITCHELL Well, I, like everybody in the training business, have a website cleverly named cliftonmitchell.com and anybody is welcome to go to my website. I'm currently doing, uh, three things in the training world. One is my full day training on the management of resistance and deal with resistant clients and is a very practical how-to training. I do mental health facilities and conferences like yours. The other thing I'm doing currently is my legal and ethical game show, which we've also done at the psychotherapy networker and we just have a wonderful time. 

01:02:45
RICH SIMON (crosstalk)Which I've played I might say and Cliff has done this for a couple of years at the networker symposium and it's been a huge hit. Yep. 

01:02:55
CLIFF MITCHELL Yes, and it grew out of this need to make legal and ethical training fun and so we play Jeopardy and Family Feud and, uh, use electronic remotes and responses and have teams and we don't do long, boring lectures. Another thing is I have a keynote that I do, uh, largely that, uh, deals with words and language in therapy. It evolved out of motivational speaking I've done, uh, and it first starts out at, at a very fun level, practical down to earth level talking about the power of words and language and how we use it. And then later I get to the scientific principles, which we now have that say hey look, this is why this is important. So all that is available if someone wanted to learn about it on my website, they're welcome to visit there. 

01:03:40
RICH SIMON OK. And, and people can find, uh, Clifton Mitchell sounds .com, sounds like it's easy enough to remember for those of you that have trouble with short-term memory, you'll find this on the Networker fulfillment page. 

01:03:50
CLIFF MITCHELL Actually if they search the words psychological resistance, uh, I will show up every time. 

01:04:00
RICH SIMON Great. All right. Good for you. You've overcome psychological resistance by going to the top. So, um, again, invitation to you all, as in all of these series, the conversation that has just happened between, uh, Cliff and I is the beginning of a really important conversation which will happen after this webcast, so we're inviting you to get a head start on that. There's a, uh, you'll see access to the comment board. We're really very interested in hearing what occurred to you, what thoughts came up, what questions you have, what connections you made as you were listening to this conversation. That is both of benefit to you, but if you're more likely to remember what you, what struck you about the conversation you can take a few moments now and jot it down and it will certainly contribute to our collective learning if as many of us as um, possible can, or so inclined, will go on the comment board and, um, and, uh, response to this. Uh, uh, Cliff has agreed to come up and at least read the comments and if he is so moved he may respond to some of them, and that will be a second round possibly of this conversation. But in any event we're really inviting you. We want to hear from you and keep this conversation going. Uh, that's it for now. What a, a fun and interesting exchange. It certainly gave me a, a lot of, uh, I love your concreteness, I love your specificity. This is, uh, you've clearly thought long and hard with unusual clarity about the nature of the therapeutic conversation. So, um, I hope, I trust that those people in the audience like me are coming away with a renewed appreciation of the subtleties of this conversational craft of psychotherapy that you laid out for us so splendidly. Thank you so much. 

01:05:50
CLIFF MITCHELL Thank you. 

01:05:55
RICH SIMON And that's it for now. So we'll look forward to seeing you next time.
