Thought for Food Session 1 

00:00:05
JAN So it's nice to see you, Elaine. Thanks for coming along today. Um, and we're probably going to spend about, about 40 minutes or so this morning. And, um, the purpose is for me to find out a little bit about what's brought you here and perhaps to explain a little bit about what, what we could do together and to, to help you. Um, so first off, I just, I just wonder how you feel about coming here and, and doing the video, in fact. 

00:00:30
ELAINE I feel a little bit anxious. 

00:00:30
JAN Right. Yeah. And I wonder what you're expecting's going to happen? 

00:00:35
ELAINE Um, what I might talk about? 

00:00:40
JAN Right. 

00:00:40
ELAINE Um, um, what I might say that other people might, might hear. 

00:00:50
JAN Right. 

00:00:50
ELAINE Just a little bit of anxiousness. 

00:00:50
JAN So although we're coming to talk about weight management, it sounds like there's also a little bit of anxiety that it, it might, might lead onto other things. 

00:01:05
ELAINE It did cross my mind. 

00:01:05
JAN Yeah. Well, I suppose for the purposes of, of the film, um, we're not gonna be, necessarily, um, include everything on this. This is going to be about weight management, so we are gonna focus on, on that specifically. 

00:01:20
ELAINE Okay. 

00:01:20
JAN So, you're here to, because you're interested in, in working to, to manage your weight. 

00:01:25
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:01:25
JAN Um, and perhaps it might be helpful first of all to find out a little bit about, um, what you're hoping to achieve in terms of weight loss. 

00:01:40
ELAINE Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it's a bit more than about weight loss. It, it's a little bit about, um, what is healthy to, you know, what, what should I be eating. 

00:01:55
JAN Right. 

00:01:55
ELAINE So, um, I think I've shifted from "I wanna load, lose loads of weight" to, you know, "what's gonna be the best for me as a person?" 

00:02:05
JAN Right, so that's really interesting 'cuz it sounds like it's not just about the weight. It's more about, um, eating healthily, uh, and you as a person eating healthily. 

00:02:15
ELAINE Yeah. Yeah, 'cuz there has been a time, you know, the, the term now is "size 0" and, you know, for me I used to be like, size 10, size 12 and I have been at that place, you know, I wanna be that size. But that's not such an important, important thing anymore about what size you're wearing. But it is a lot about, you know, what am I putting into my mouth, is that any good for me? 

00:02:40
JAN Right. So it might be that at the end of these sessions you don't necessarily lose weight, but you might be eating more healthily. 

00:02:50
ELAINE Yeah, um, I, I need to lose some actual weight, so I'd like that, but it is, yeah, it is a lot about what types of food am I eating and, and how, you know, are they good foods, are they energizing foods. 

00:03:05
JAN Yeah. And, I, I suppose what we can sort of discover as time goes on, whether or not eating more healthily, more energizing type foods as you describe, whether or not that does actually have an impact on your weight. 

00:03:15
ELAINE Yes. 

00:03:20
JAN So we're gonna be focusing more on the health rather than the weight. 

00:03:20
ELAINE Yes. Yes. 'Cuz it's a long time since I've weighed. I, I could only guess. I haven't been on the scales for about three to five years on a scale. Part of that is resistance, but part of that is, well, does that scale really say anything? 

00:03:40
JAN Right. So you said there might be some resistance about getting on the scale. Um, what might be going on there for you? What? 

00:03:45
ELAINE That's my anxieties. You know, when I actually hear the kilos or, um, I'm pounds and ounces, but I can convert it 'cuz nursing was my background, so, um, you know, when I used hear like, 84 kilos, I know, I knew exactly what that was and that would send me into, "Oh my God, I'm that weight!" And that, that, that poundage would creep into it. So, um, it was something that I decided, well, if I didn't hear what that is, I'll get less anxious 'cuz when I got anxious, I, I might be to eat more or, you know, become more panicky about that. 

00:04:25
JAN All right, so there's something about the meaning of the weight for you. And perhaps that could be something we'd explore. Uh, um, in a later session. But there's also something that you said there, that when you became more anxious, um, your tendency was that you might become a bit panicky, but you also might, um, eat more. 

00:04:50
ELAINE Yes. 

00:04:50
JAN Yeah. So that sounds like food is playing a, a certain role for you there. You know, almost as if there's a link for you. 

00:04:55
ELAINE Yeah, I think I've really started to identify that, um, um, you know, and I don't know if it's appropriate at this point, what, you know, I know where the food, um, you know, the, the, the guess the word "comfort" might come to mind, the food comfort has come from, you know. Um, it was, it's a bit about my mum. She feeds everybody with comfort, with food. 

00:05:20
JAN Right, right. So food was your mum's language of love, as it were. Her sort of, her way that she, she was able to comfort. And you've identified that that's a way that you do comfort yourself as well. 

00:05:30
ELAINE I think I've started to identify that, started to work on that, but definitely, you know, I've thought a lot about that. 

00:05:40
JAN Would you want to spend some time working on that in these sessions? 

00:05:40
ELAINE Um, yeah, the anxiety cracked up a little bit there, you know, as to what, you know, I'm quite, uh, yeah, that's okay. Uh, but that anxiety level just went up a notch then when, that, um, 'cuz I'm, I'm thinking, you know, do I want to revisit all of that again and um, 'cuz there's a bit more to that than just that the, that. But I guess I'd go with it. 

00:06:05
JAN I suppose it could be something that we could look at, um, at some stage, but it might well be that if we're looking at healthy eating and, and monitoring the food and working at that level to start with, it might be something that becomes less important to have to look at. 

00:06:20
ELAINE Yes. Yes. And I can't see how we won't touch on it because it so much part of, of it, but yeah. 

00:06:30
JAN So what I thought we could do to start with is to spend a little bit of time looking at where you see and how you see the weight having gone on over the years and, and the un-, unhealthy, unhelpful eating patterns, um, for you. 

00:06:45
ELAINE Okay. Yeah. 

00:06:50
JAN So, here you are today. You're wanting to, to eat more healthy and hope to lose a little bit of weight. When were you first aware that, um, it was becoming something of a, an issue for you, something of a problem? 

00:07:05
ELAINE Um, do you mean like, whenever or do you mean? 

00:07:10
JAN Yeah. I, I mean, I was thinking, have, you know, has weight always been something that you've been conscious of, yeah. 

00:07:20
ELAINE That is such a toughie question. Um, yeah, yeah, and I, I can answer it. Um, as a, as a real young kid, um, there's a lot of anxiety in my home life, a lot of anxiety. I needed to be anxious for reasons, reasons I'm not gonna just say here and now, but, um, so I was always anxious and I was quite thin. Apparently, um, you know, family tell me that I lived on my nerves. I, um, you know, um, puny, um, you know, um, my father used to call me "thin-ribs" 'cuz, you know, 'cuz I was very, apparently, I don't remember that myself. Um, and then because of these situations, I moved in with my grandparents who were quite nurturing and loveable. I think I was about 12 when I finally decided, or somebody said that I needed to go and live with them. I can't remember. And that's when I got bigger. Um. 

00:08:25
JAN So actually, what you're saying is you were, you were quite a skinny little child. 

00:08:30
ELAINE Yes. I think, I think it was the other extreme. That I was very, um, puny. Well, these are the words, actually I'm using some of the words that, that has been said to me, thin-ribs, puny, um, skeleton. But I must have been really young at that time 'cuz I don't remember names like that at school. Um, I never had any bullying about weight, so I don't think in school that I was particularly, you know, like, like, overweight. I was always probably bigger than a lot of people, but now where I had bullying about being overweight. Um, I have had periods where I've joined every slimming club in creation. Um, from, um, you know, buying slimming tablets, you know, um, um. 

00:09:20
JAN So something happened when, after, because I'm almost wondering if that when you moved in with your grandparents that they sort of fed you up because you were so thin. 

00:09:35
ELAINE Yes. 

00:09:35
JAN Almost that they gave you possibly a, a, you know, a lot of food because you were very thin. 

00:09:40
ELAINE Yes. And ov-, and over the years I've sort of thought about the fact that, you know, that, um, it was, it was a much more comfortable place to be. Um, you know, whether that's got any significance, you know, that, that, that, um, you know, home life, I had to be on the edge all of the time whereas in my grandparents', uh, you know, it was very warm, loving, nurturing. 

00:10:10
JAN So there's that sense of, when I'm relaxed, I'm, I'm, I can eat. 

00:10:15
ELAINE Yeah, or, yeah 'cuz I, I don't remember people saying things to me like that I wasn't a good eater, it's just that, the, the weight wasn't there in this, in this time where I was called names. That was only by the family, by my father, mainly. Um, so every slimming club, everything. And then, you know, um, and then yo-yos. You know, one minute I'd be a size 14, the next minute I could be a size 10 or 12. 

00:10:50
JAN What do you think you were doing during those times that wasn't helping your, your weight and your eating patterns? When you were doing the slimming class and? 

00:11:00
ELAINE God, I, I think, you know, I was in such a different place to where I am now. 'Cuz I, you know, like, I started off this session by saying, you know, um, the weight doesn't bother me, you know, I'd like to be more healthy and things. But then I was fanatical about image, you know, and fanatical about what the scale said. You know, it was this, you know, you, you have to be like, ten stone, you have to be nine stone, nine and a half stone. 

00:11:30
JAN Right. So lots of sort of rules that you set yourself about how you were seeing yourself at that time in your life around the weight that you were. 

00:11:35
ELAINE Yes. 

00:11:35
JAN And you mentioned that you tried every diet that was going and slimming clubs that were, that were going. How do you see the fact that you were dieting, um, as, as, what part do you think that played in the fact that the weight kept creeping up? 

00:11:55
ELAINE Yeah, I, you know, looking back, 'cuz that, that again is something that I've, you know, when the, when jumping on the scales went, so did those slimming clubs and things, you know, and that's a long time now. Far longer than five years. Yeah, you know, sort of, you know, reinforcing, you know, sort of, um, sort of, um, well if one don't work, another one will or, you know, let, let's try this one, let's try that one. Um, but never, you know, where I am now, you know, it, although I want to improve some stuff, at least I'm on this like, sort of plateau. Whereas before it was like, really ad hoc, you know, it was really, um, up there, down there, you know? I, I might keep to the diet then I might starve myself. You know, it was all of that. 

00:12:45
JAN Right. And, and what you're sort of describing there is almost like a, sort of a black and white state that you were in with your diet. You're either on a diet and then if it wasn't working, 

00:12:55
ELAINE You were off the diet. 

00:12:55
JAN You were off the diet completely. 

00:12:55
ELAINE Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:13:00
JAN And, uh, it's, I'm, I'm just thinking, um, about when you're on a diet, what sort of diets would they tend to be? 

00:13:10
ELAINE Do you mean? 

00:13:10
JAN Well they, would they be diets in which you were, you were restricting yourself? 

00:13:10
ELAINE Oh, yeah. I mean, every diet you can think of. Everything you can think of. Um, you know, it's laughable to think what things I have done. You know, the egg and grapefruit, the cabbage soup, WeightWatchers, Slimming World, um, you know, I'm not discrediting any of those, you know, in their right places. You know, the Heart Foundation where people, you know, they're going in for major heart surgery and there I am, trying to use their diet. Everything you can think of, however absurd, absurd. 

00:13:40
JAN So when you were on it you'd be losing the weight and then you'd come off it or you wouldn't be able to stay on it and then the weight would go back on. I mean, that, that's a very, very common pattern with people who, with dieting, and that's something which would sort of highlight for me that diets don't work. 

00:14:00
ELAINE Yeah. Yes. And I'm at that place now, absolutely. And I suppose the biggest, uh, biggest factor as well is when I was diagnosed with underactive thyroid 'cuz, um, I was at that time going to WeightWatchers and I was going with my mother and I think my sister was going with, with me at the time and, and neither of those need to lose weight. They go to maintain, they, their ideal weight. Um, and, um, you know, I was really trying hard on, on the WeightWatchers diet and not an ounce was coming off. And, you know, they'd say to me, "Oh, you're bound to be eating. We know you, you know, you love sweet stuff," and, you know, sort of ridiculing me in the, in the class. And so, you know, that was really hurtful and I'd, uh, thought, "Well, I'll have," I was nursing, I knew about thyroids so I had some blood tests and I was underactive. But my first thought wasn't about, "I've got an underactive thyroid," it was about, "Oh my God, I can, you know, um, take tablets now and it'll, you know, spur the metabolism up and I'm gonna lose the weight again." So it was still about, you know, it seems ludicrous now. I wasn't worried about the fact that the, the underactive thyroid could slow your organs down so that they, you know, part of your organs, your organs could stop if you're not, if you don't have medication. It was like, I could lose weight. 

00:15:25
JAN So weight was very central to how you were seeing yourself. 

00:15:30
ELAINE Yeah. And I, I don't want that bit to come back. 

00:15:30
JAN Yeah. Yeah. It's somehow getting the balance right. Uh, and I think balance is sort of the, the key word to go right the way through because what we're hoping is some of the things we can talk about in these sessions is something that will feel that you can carry on for the rest of your life. 

00:15:50
ELAINE Yes. Yes. And there is that balance. You know, it's not right, it's not wrong. You know, 'cuz that's, you know, that's the terminology I would use before. "Oh, you've cheated." Um, you know, "Oh, you shouldn't've had that," you know, "That was naughty." I, I, I don't use those words on myself, um, you know, "They're slipping," but not like when I was doing the dieting. 

00:16:10
JAN Yeah. 'Cuz what you seem to be saying, Elaine, is when you did use those terms on yourself when you did something "wrong" or "naughty" it meant that you stopped altogether. 

00:16:20
ELAINE Yeah, stopped or 

00:16:20
JAN Or you set yourself a even tougher goal. 

00:16:25
ELAINE Yes. 

00:16:25
JAN Yeah. So that's really useful to have a little bit of background as to your sort of relationship with dieting and food. And, and it really makes me appreciate how, um, challenging doing this video is. The fact that you're, you're, you're prepared to, to give it a go in a slightly different way this time. 

00:16:40
ELAINE Yes. 

00:16:40
JAN Yeah. So thank you for that. 

00:16:45
ELAINE And I think that was a little bit about my anxiety, you know, what, what could I evoke. You know, 'cuz I know, I do know enough about myself where it's all from. 

00:16:55
JAN But I suppose in some ways, what I would be more interested in knowing, um, at the moment is what you think you're doing currently that's not helping your healthy eating program. I, I wonder if you're aware of things that you might be eating or things that you're doing which are possibly not helping you. 

00:17:15
ELAINE Yeah, sure. Um, I, I don't wanna use the word "improve" 'cuz that's sort of says this right and wrong stuff again, but, yeah, I mean, over the last couple of years I've really took a good look at what's going in, in the mouth and continued to do that. And I'm lucky that I've now found new friends, um, in various parts of my life, um, you know, who, who eat sensibly or eat well. And so I sort of think, "Oh, that's what they're having today. I might try that," 'cuz there's something, you know, it's about education. 

00:17:50
JAN Right. 

00:17:50
ELAINE Um. 

00:17:55
JAN I'm just going to, perhaps just, just jot these down, that these are some of the things you think aren't being helpful. 

00:18:00
ELAINE Um, aren't being helpful, right, okay. That was an helpful one. 

00:18:05
JAN Well, actually, well, I suppose what is, is the lack of education around food 'cuz it sounds like what you're saying is that, that up until fairly recently you hadn't necessarily known what to eat. 

00:18:15
ELAINE Yes. No, nor not taking any notice of, perhaps, you know. 'Cuz in my nursing background, you know, I would be able to tell other people, but it's sort, it's sort of that, you know, that education sinking into yourself, isn't it? You know. Um, yeah, so, and things that are not, still not helpful is, um, this is quite a toughie to say. It's about not spending money on good food for me. 

00:18:50
JAN Right. 

00:18:50
ELAINE So, um, a little bit about my background is being single parent for 20 years and when you want your children to have things, something's gotta give. And so the only, you know, the only place you can do that is sometimes food. 

00:19:10
JAN Yeah. 

00:19:10
ELAINE 'Cuz you gotta pay the house bills, you gotta pay the mortgage. And, um, so it'd be bits about, you know, you know, you may have �10, �15 to go to Quick-Sav for the whole week. You know, Quick-Sav being the quick, cheaper shop at the time. What would the kids want, what's good for the kids. How many bananas, apples, you know, um, what's their favorite foods. Um, so there's a bit about that. So of course I am in a different position, you know, um, prosperity is getting better, but I don't think I've, I've followed that through, you know, up here. 

00:19:50
JAN Yeah. So in the past, the fact that you've had to be very careful about what you've spent on food and your priorities are probably been towards the children, it might have been A, practically that you hadn't got enough money to buy the things you wanted, but also, they came first. 

00:20:05
ELAINE Yes. 

00:20:05
JAN Yeah. 

00:20:05
ELAINE Yes. And, you know, sometimes I think back and think, "Oh, gosh. That wasn't quite the way to do it," but, uh, um, me and my youngest boy were there, um, for many years, um, and, you know, 'cuz they're little and there's 10 years between them. And the little one then was like, only little, but he'd say things like, "I want a PlayStation game," and I don't know if it was PlayStation then or another completely, I can't remember now. But, um, you know, I'd think, "Right. Well, if he has that," you know, it's only food that you can, you can, um, 'cuz you can't say to the water board or you can't say to the electricity board, you know, I, I, I can't pay you this month because I wanna get a PlayStation game, but you can cut back, you know, and, and I need to be, obviously, clothes and things for me, but it would be the food. I think, "Right, if I take that money out for the PlayStation game, this what I'm left with for food," and now I've gotta make that last for a week. So, so it'd be what can I, how can I have the best out of that money so, yeah. Yeah. 

00:21:20
JAN And that might be something that we look at again. 

00:21:25
ELAINE Yes. And now I haven't shifted, that, "Well, Elaine, you can really afford to buy nicer, um," well not nicer food, but, you know, am I explaining it? The, that you can? 

00:21:40
JAN Well, what I'm struck with, Elaine, is that when we first started talking, you talked about the food that your grandparents gave you as being their way and the food your mum made for you was their way of showing love. 

00:21:50
ELAINE Yes. 

00:21:50
JAN And what you're saying is that, that that's the sacrifice that you made to give your children something at the time. So food's being used in this, but in a very different way, um, with your, with you because actually you've taken it from yourself, haven't you, to give to your children? So, so those are a couple of things. I wonder if there's anything else that you currently see that you're doing which isn't helping you? 

00:22:15
ELAINE Um, sort of trying to find, like this morning, um, before I came here, quite busy 'cuz, uh, life is busy for everyone, um, but for me it is. 

00:22:25
JAN Do you think that has an impact? 

00:22:30
ELAINE Yes. 'Cuz this morning, you know, um, cup of coffee when I got up, um, would've liked to have sat down and had a, a, had an healthy breakfast. Didn't. Um, so came and, but on the way what I was pleased about today, but I still would like some changes in this, you know, at least I had like, um, the Go Ahead biscuit, the orange and sultana ones. I love them. I've got a crave for them. And a, and a pear. Whereas, perhaps previously I would've run in the garage and got a bar of chocolate or something, you know? 

00:23:00
JAN Right. So it's been busy because of your lifestyle. It's not actually having the time to, to cook and prepare and, and feed yourself in the way that you might want to. Yeah. 

00:23:10
ELAINE And I can't cook that good, mind. I forgot to to say that! 

00:23:15
JAN Okay. 

00:23:15
ELAINE You know, 'cuz that fits with some of the other stuff. 

00:23:15
JAN So the lack of education is not only about food, it's also about cooking, sounds, sounds like. 

00:23:20
ELAINE Well, like sometimes I guess, when, you know, it, yeah, it's about the education and practicing, you know, 'cuz I'm learning that you can make fabulous meals out of, you know, I see that program Can't Cook, Won't Cook. You know, one carrier bag and they make the, and I'm thinking, "Good God, girl, you could've done that!" You know, years ago. But, so it's, it's that education, isn't it, that you can transform things out of hardly anything if you have the time and such a mind to it. 

00:23:50
JAN Yeah. And I suppose to some extent that in order to, to learn what you can do, you, there're gonna be some mistakes. But if you're on a tight budget, you know, you might not have been able to afford to make those mistakes with the food. You had to know what was. 

00:24:05
ELAINE Oh, absolutely, you know, you couldn't afford to, if I, if I made a meal, I mean, they'd take the mick out of me anyway, the both of them. My older son's a great cook now. Um, but they, you know, they take the mick out of me, you know, "Oh, God, she's not trying that again, now is she?" And, you know, but you wouldn't have in those younger days, you know, you, you knew that that meal was all the meal that was there, really so they had to eat it. 

00:24:30
JAN Yeah. You had to be right. 

00:24:30
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:24:30
JAN Yeah. How about anything else you think that's not helping your sort of healthy lifestyle? Anything that you, you, you currently do that doesn't actually help? 

00:24:40
ELAINE Um. 

00:24:45
[sil.] 

00:24:50
ELAINE It, it's like my mindset needs to catch up a bit. That's one thing. Um. 

00:24:55
JAN I was sort of wondering about sort of activities, how active you see yourself as being. 

00:24:55
ELAINE Um, well, active in the wrong sense. You know, I am active. You know, I, I, but again, there's a downside to that 'cuz I probably never sit down. You know, I, I probably, I'm up in the morning and I go to bed at night and I probably, you know, I sit down for my job, but I probably don't actually sit down. But then, I don't go to an exercise class, so that's just like being busy. 

00:25:20
JAN Yeah. 

00:25:20
ELAINE You know, working or, you know, um, housework-y stuff or, um. So yeah, an exercise, um, again, some over the last couple of months, little bits of change, you know, like I will park the car further, um, and I will, um, you know, the stairs, you know, um, working at the uni, I will use the stairs when, whenever I can. Um, I'd like, I'd like that to also be a, 'cuz I think that'd be good for me as well, to, it's, like quality time. 

00:25:55
JAN Yeah. I was thinking that as you were saying that, that something about exercise and having time. I mean, what, what seems to be coming across as the, the main thing at the moment for you with regards to your sort of, your, your eating lifestyle is time. 

00:26:05
ELAINE Yeah. Yeah. And again, you know, it, I question myself about that. You're saying that I'm not giving myself that time, you know, to, to enjoy that, you know, you know, um, or do I really need to look at my, my week overall and say, you know, something's gotta change? And I am coming to all of that, but it's a toughie. 

00:26:30
JAN Yeah. I mean, what would be the advantages of, of change for you? Of, of say, you know, we, we do revise your, your eating patterns and you do lose a little bit of weight. 

00:26:40
ELAINE Yeah. Yeah, I would like to, you know, I would like to, if, if we were thinking this was our last session, you know, I would like to be able to say that there's something in place that, that's going to be good for me long-term. You know, like, like time to prepare, time to enjoy, um, time to say, that's exe-, exercise, you know. Um, I'd like it to be something that I enjoy. You know, I've tried gyms and things. I think, "Oh, God," you know, it's just so boring. What're they all up to, like? You know, I, I, exercise that could be enjoyable, you know. 

00:27:15
JAN So something that would feel the right fit for you. 

00:27:20
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:27:20
JAN What would be the benefit of that? How would that, how would that change your life? 

00:27:25
ELAINE Um, you know, I think it'd make me, um, you know, feel better about myself sort of 'cuz there is still that, you know, that you, you do still hear those nagging sort of, uh, the old way of thinking. "Oh, come on," you know, uh, "Oh, look how fat you are now," and, you know, in, in, in the mirror, you know? Uh, you know, or "You'd look better if you lost some weight in that dress," or whatever, you know. 

00:27:50
JAN So how you would see yourself might be a little more positive? 

00:27:55
ELAINE Yes. 

00:27:55
JAN What would you be doing, I wonder, that you don't do now? 

00:28:00
ELAINE Yeah. It is about preparation and time. You know, it is something about taking that time 'cuz everything for me is quick. You know, let's, let's have something on the quick, you know, sandwich or. Uh. 

00:28:20
JAN I just wondered, once you got to that state where you had a bit more time, you felt you were eating more healthily and perhaps doing a bit more exercise activity that felt right for you, I wonder what would be the difference in your life? What would it mean you could do that you don't think you're able to do now? 

00:28:40
[sil.] 

00:28:45
ELAINE I can't even think about that for a minute. I, I think, I don't think there's things that I couldn't do 'cuz I, sort of it doesn't get in the way an awful lot. Um. 

00:29:00
[sil.] 

00:29:05
ELAINE I think it's more about me, you know, I think it's more about, you know, my self-perception, my, my, my inner me I think it's more about because, you know, I have moved from, "Oh, you can't go out 'cuz you, you look too fat," you know that has been years and years ago. You know, let's just now go. You know, or throwing the clothes on the bed, you know, that one don't fit, you don't look right in that. That, you know, and now I put things on and think, you know, that's okay. You know, you, you do look a bit overweight, but that, so I've shifted. So it doesn't stop me, um. Might have to think about that one a bit more. 

00:29:40
JAN Yeah, 'cuz I guess what I am talking about there is actually a goal, isn't it? 

00:29:45
ELAINE Yes. 

00:29:45
JAN 'Cuz how do we measure when we've got there? 

00:29:50
ELAINE Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, that's a good point. Okay. Um. 

00:29:55
[sil.] 

00:30:00
ELAINE Yeah, I, I would like a, if we were to measure as it is now, you know, what's come into the top of my head is I'd like to have a good evening meal. I'd like to sit down, I'd like it to be healthy, you know, that could be, uh, I never eat good on some foods because of all of this. I'm, um, I love it when people prepare for me and things and I love food, but it's, I I'd like to be able to think I'm loving this, you know, the preparation, like the, a feeling I have when I maybe go out on a nice restaurant or to people who cook really well, you know? That overwhelms me. I think, you know, I, it's really incredible that people can, it's like an art to me. You know, that the, it's so loving. So I would like to be able to do that, to have that feeling for myself, just about the evening meal. You know, that I could go home, the food would be there, I could take time to prepare it and, you know, see it presented, but then sit down and think, mmm, you know, this is lov-, like I would if, if, if you or somebody else was preparing it for me 'cuz I really appreciate people who give me good food. Does that, does that make sense? 

00:31:10
JAN Yeah. Um, and I, and I think that really links back to where we almost came in, wasn't it, when you said your mum gave you good food. Lots of loving food. And your grandparents gave you lots of that. How do you see that linking with that? 

00:31:30
ELAINE Yeah, there is, there is a link there. There is, there is a link there about, um, you know, being fulfilled and being loved by food. For, for my mother sometimes I would've liked a, a bit of something else other than food. You know, in crises, it's, you know, here's a chicken, cook yourself a bit of lamb, you know, but, um, and I can't cook it anyway. You know, what I might have wanted was like a hug or, or, uh, put an arm round me or something and say "It'll be okay." So there's that side to it as well. 

00:32:00
JAN Yeah. But I was also thinking about when you said, you know, how it, how you feel when somebody is, cooked you something. 

00:32:10
ELAINE Yes. Yes. 

00:32:10
JAN And how that feels really special for you. 

00:32:10
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:32:10
JAN And what you're saying is you want to be able to do that for yourself. 

00:32:15
ELAINE I, I, if we were thinking about a goal, I'd like to have that same feeling and think, "Well, you done it, now you go and enjoy it," and be able to take the time, you know, 'cuz, 'cuz I got a lovely dining table and I, I like it, you know, but I guess I don't sit at it. And I'd like, if that was a goal, I'd like to say, okay, you know, um, there's your hour, you've prepared your meal, you've, it's, it looks nice, now sit there and enjoy it and. 

00:32:40
JAN And I almost want to add at the end of that, "because you're worth it." 

00:32:45
ELAINE Right. Yeah. Yeah. That does fit. 

00:32:50
JAN Yeah. 

00:32:50
ELAINE Yeah. I deserve it, I'm worth it. Yeah. That, that has touched earlier stuff, yeah. That is right. And that, uh, would be a goal. 

00:33:00
JAN Yeah. 

00:33:00
ELAINE Yeah, I'd like that, yeah. 

00:33:00
JAN I wonder if we need to put in place anything else as well, some markers for us to know that we're, we're headed on track. 'Cuz that, that, that's, that's a goal that might be one that might be harder for us to, to both see. 

00:33:20
ELAINE Yeah. Well, I'd have to buy the food first. You know, 'cuz if, if that was the goal for tonight, you know, I, there's, um, I have been shopping this week, actually, but, 'cuz that's another thing, you see, I, I just, I'm trying not to use words like "I hate going shopping." I'm trying to change the terminology. So I enjoy shopping. Um, but if, you know, if you came home with me, in the fridge there's all stuff for Liam, my younger son. You know, he's 19 and, and it's all these things. And there's a fruit bowl there. Um, but if I was to go home and think what, I wouldn't, there wouldn't be anything that I could go home and say, prepare yourself a meal 'cuz it's, it's all about him. That's, yeah, so I'd have to start, that's one marker, that I've bought stuff that, that I like. 

00:34:05
JAN Right. 

00:34:05
ELAINE Well, I like what's there, but, so the shift even before that is I can eat his food! Do you see that? 

00:34:15
JAN Right. So the food that you bought for your sons is for them and not for you. 

00:34:20
ELAINE Yeah. Well, it's only Liam now. So there needs to be a shift in that as well, really. 

00:34:25
JAN Almost that you're entitled to have the food. 

00:34:25
ELAINE Yes. Yes. That I can share this food with you. 

00:34:30
JAN Yeah. How do you feel about, um, observing yourself between now and when we next meet around food? Um, and by that I mean, well, first of all, um, sort of monitoring what you're eating, sort of, possibly keeping a, a, a bit of a diary around your food. But also monitoring any thoughts and feelings that you have when you're perhaps shopping for food or, or, or eating food. 

00:34:55
ELAINE Okay. Yeah. No, I would do that, yeah. That sounds good. 

00:35:00
JAN Because I suppose the first thing we wanted to do is, is to know exactly what happens, what are the thoughts, you know, that, and, and how realistic are some of those thoughts and whether or not we can, we can actually look at, look at them and unpack them a little bit. Yeah. I wonder if we need to have any other goals at, at all? 

00:35:20
ELAINE Um. I, you know, I'm thinking even as I'm sitting here, that's a, that's a bit of a goal anyway. 

00:35:30
JAN It's a big goal. You know, so, and, and why I ask that, Elaine, was because you talked before in your dieting that you would set yourself a, a diet and you'd stick to it or not and if you didn't, then it, then it almost felt like you'd gone from one extreme to the other and I'm wondering if, what we possibly need to do, 'cuz that is a big goal, is to have some goals, 'cuz we may not, or may or may not get to that one, you know? And of course, that would complete the pattern, wouldn't it, of, of how it's been for you in the past? But if might be helpful to have something that you can actually feel, well I have achieved this. 

00:36:10
ELAINE No, that's a good point 'cuz, yeah, 'cuz I don't want to shift back into that pressure cycle. You know, um, I, I want to do it 'cuz I really wanna do it. And I, and I, that, that goal, I do really want. Yeah. Yeah. 

00:36:25
JAN But I was thinking that, sort of, um, slightly different tact, thinking about your activity, your exercise. Perhaps we could think about, and it might be something between now and next time we meet, that, think about, well, perhaps, yeah, I would like to be a bit more active, um, I have started part, cart, parking my car. Um, perhaps I could do a little bit of walking or, or perhaps some, you know, some little things that you might be able to do, differently that might make quite an impact, might make a difference. 

00:36:50
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:36:50
JAN Yeah. 

00:36:55
ELAINE Okay. 

00:36:55
JAN Yeah, I mean, the reason I would be sort of suggesting that is because, um, I think it, it, it can be sometimes easier to take some big goals on when you felt that, I've achieved something along the way. 

00:37:05
ELAINE Yeah. Yeah. 

00:37:10
JAN Yeah. 

00:37:10
ELAINE I'm just thinking, you know, um, I like walking. Um, you see, I'd have to even tap into what the hell do I like! You know, 'cuz, 'cuz, you know, it's so far back, you know, I, I'm thinking, you know, I might have to have, you know, uh, some time on my own to even start thinking about, well, what is it like? 

00:37:35
JAN That sounds like a really good idea to, to perhaps think, well, what would you want to do? 

00:37:40
ELAINE Yeah, 'cuz I have been to gyms before and things and I, I, um, there's a big one, I'm not going to say the name, there's a big hotel that, that, um, that I went for the induction and, 'cuz the NHS can have, um, big discounts off it. So off I goes, and he takes me round now and I, and I run into this room and they were like bloody soldiers! They was just, you know, men and women after women on, on these things and I, I was thinking, "Oh, no. No." You know, I need something, it just doesn't suit me, so I need, first of all, to think about in terms of exercise. You know, um, I've been to CenterParcs, took the kids, and I, I love biking. You know, um, and so it, it's about tapping into, you know, what do I really like as a form of exercise? 

00:38:30
JAN And also, because time seems to be the main issue as to why it's been hard for you, you know, what can you realistically fit in? And what I'm thinking is that if you're not doing very much activity at the moment, although you, it sounds as if you've started to make some changes, anything you do is gonna make a difference. 

00:38:50
ELAINE Yes. Yes. From today. 

00:38:55
JAN From today, yeah. 

00:38:55
ELAINE Yeah, I feel that, actually, even as we're speaking. 

00:38:55
JAN Yeah. 

00:39:00
ELAINE Yeah. I might, you know, I really, even though as we're talking, I'm really starting to think about a lot of things. 

00:39:05
JAN Right. What sort of things do you think you'd want to hear from me that would, would help you, help you on this? 

00:39:15
ELAINE Um, if I get stuck in the, you know, what do I like sort of thing, you know, um, perhaps you've had experience, perhaps you've tried exercises, you know, um, and it's not that I'd be thinking, "Oh, well, it, you know, if Jan, then perhaps that'd be good for me." It'd be, you know, "This is what's out there." You know, 'cuz, you know, and, and foods, you know, um, you know, um, if you had any thoughts on that. Um, bit of encouragement along the way. Um. 

00:39:45
JAN What, what would be the thing that would encourage you most? 

00:39:50
ELAINE Um, you know, obviously, words like, you know, you, you can do this, Elaine. You know, you can change if you really want to. But al-, also about, um, you know, tapping in, is this what you really want? 'Cuz I think that's really, the more I'm talking about this with you is, is, it's about is this what I really wa-, 'cuz before, it was about, that's the external factor, you know, that's what magazines said, you know, and I, I, I really don't wanna buy into that anymore, so it's about, you know, just checking in with me, you know, is this for us, you know, or is, or is this, you know, is this still for you? 

00:40:25
JAN Yeah. 

00:40:25
ELAINE Does that make sense? 

00:40:30
JAN Yeah, and I think that makes complete and utter sense, and it sort of is backed up by, um, research which shows that people who are doing it for the external factor, as you said, for the, you know, for other people, are less likely to, to, um, succeed in, in, in maintaining their healthy. It, it has really got to be a reason for you. Um, be it how you see yourself or health or, um, yeah. So I agree that it, it, um, it might be something to think about. 

00:41:00
ELAINE Yes. 

00:41:00
JAN You know, how's it going to be for you. 

00:41:05
ELAINE Yes. 

00:41:05
JAN You said also about some sort of information around food and activity and exercise. How, how would you feel, um, meeting with a, a, a, a dietician to have some input on, on the food aspect, what, what's healthy, what's not healthy? 

00:41:25
ELAINE Yeah. Um, yeah, I think, I think it would be a good idea. Um, on one level, I'm sort of saying you really do know, Elaine, 'cuz I was nursing, you know, I've been in the NHS 25 years. Like, I do know what foods, um. Again, it's, it's a bit like, um, well, what's right for me? You know, 'cuz I, I know fruit, veg, you know, I know carbohydrates. It, it's, it's trying to find that balance with me all the time, you know? It, they may all be the right foods, but what's right for me? Yeah, so I think that might, might be useful. 

00:42:05
JAN And that would be something that we, we could do here. Um, but what you're saying is, although you know what's right, you might not know what's right for you because of the, the quantities. And I think again, just observing yourself for a week, you know, A, the thoughts that you're having, but actually what you're eating, might give us some useful information, um, that we can use then to find exactly, you know, how much you are eating. 

00:42:30
ELAINE Yeah, that sounds good. 

00:42:30
JAN Yeah? We probably need drawing things a little bit to a close now and I, and I just wonder what you might be taking from, from today. 

00:42:45
ELAINE Yeah. Um, well, it's gone quicker than I thought. And my anxiety levels have gone down a lot. 

00:42:50
JAN Right. 

00:42:50
ELAINE You, know, they 

00:42:50
JAN How's that happened? 

00:42:55
ELAINE Um, because we didn't talk about, too much about what I didn't wanna talk about, you know, it has been kept, although we can't ignore some factors, but it has kept to the weight, to the weight issue and I'm really glad about that. Um, you know, that your approach has been, you know, um, comforting, really. You know, um, I've, I've felt that you've really understood what I've said. 

00:43:25
JAN Right. Interesting you use the word "comforting" 'cuz that was something you used quite early on as well. 

00:43:25
ELAINE Yes. 

00:43:30
JAN So that might be something that, that might be my role in this to a certain extent. 

00:43:35
ELAINE Okay. Yes. Um, and what I'm taking away is that, um, yeah, it's been really good to sort of, um, you know, it's, it's not something, obviously, that I didn't know, but it's good to sort of verbalize it and just, you know, just get it out there and say, well, look, this is all the connections and, and, you know, this is the way forward. I really can, you know, even as I'm talking, I can, I've got an image of me sitting at that dining table enjoying a meal for myself. You know, um. 

00:44:10
JAN That's your goal. 

00:44:10
ELAINE Yes. Yes, and so, and also I'm being realistic and thinking, okay, you know, you, it's not going to happen overnight and you need to start thinking about the smaller goals to get there. 

00:44:25
JAN Yeah. Yeah, and I, I agree with the comment, "It's not gonna happen overnight," because what you've said is this is a pattern that's been happening for a long time, so in some ways, it would be unrealistic to expect it to, to change overnight. 

00:44:40
ELAINE Yes. 

00:44:40
JAN And what we're wanting is something that just feels that it fits for you. 

00:44:45
ELAINE Yeah. 

00:44:45
JAN Yeah. 

00:44:45
ELAINE Yeah, it's been good. 

00:44:45
JAN Okay. 

00:44:45
ELAINE Thanks so much. 

00:44:45
JAN Thanks.
